[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33044"],[0,"Birds from North Borneo (#5)"],[1,"    specimen was taken from a flock of 30 birds that had been feeding       on the coral sand and reef; and on November 30 when a single bird       landed at the small reservoir at the Cocoa Research Station and       began to feed in the shallow water. Only four specimens appear to       have been recorded earlier (Smythies, 1957:561), although Smythies       (1963:270) lists additional sight records.    _=Egretta garzetta=_ (Linnaeus): Little Egret.--On November 24 at  Karindingen Island, I observed several mixing freely with individuals of  _E. sacra_ on the coral sand beaches and reefs.    _=Egretta eulophotes=_ (Swinhoe): Chinese Egret.--_Specimen_, 1:  Ka-Karis, Kinabatangan River, 200 feet: [Male], October 20, 1963, ADG  326.         This is the only record known to me of this species from North       Borneo. Smythies (1960:126) lists 11 specimens from other parts of       Borneo.    _=Egretta sacra=_ (Gmelin): Reef Egret.--The species was observed at  Karindingen Island on August 17 and November 24, 1962, and was the most  common egret on the island. One compact flock of 50 was seen at high  tide. No white-phased birds were in the flock.    _=Bubulcus ibis coromandus=_ (Boddaert): Cattle Egret.--_Specimen_, 1:  Tongod: [Female], October 21, 1963, ADG 328.         Individuals were observed daily at Tuaran with cattle at the       Agricultural Research Centre. I saw them on December 9 when I       arrived at Tuaran and again on January 13, when I departed.    _=Ardeola bacchus=_ (Bonaparte): Chinese Pond Heron.--_Specimen_, 1: 12  mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 26, 1962, MCT 3151.         The specimen was brought to our camp by a local boy who obtained it       on a stream that ran through his kampong (village) near our sulap       (hut). The stream was a small one that ran out of the primary       forest, through the village, and back into secondary forest.    _=Butorides striatus=_ (Linnaeus): Little Green Heron.--_Specimens_, 2:  Telipok: [Female], March 10, 1963, TM 67; Sex?, December 13, 1962, TM 6.         This heron was seen at Karindingen Island on August 17, 1962, in a       small swamp near the Tawau airport on September 16, and on the reef       at Siamil Island on September 18. The specimens collected at       Telipok were not identified to subspecies.    _=Ixobrychus cinnamomeus cinnamomeus=_ (Gmelin): Chestnut  Bittern.--_Specimen_, 1: Tuaran: Sex?, December 24, 1963, SCFC 32.         This specimen was probably taken in the paddy around the       Agricultural Research Centre, where I saw Chestnut Bitterns in       January 1963.    _=Leptoptilos javanicus=_ (Horsfield): Lesser Adjutant  Stork.--_Specimen_, 1: Karindingen Island: [Male] testis small, November  24, 1962, MCT 3311.         My first observation of this species was at Karindingen Island on       August 17, when approximately 100 birds were seen feeding on the       coral sand and reefs. I saw them also within a mile of Semporna       along the ship channel, usually in the vicinity of fish traps. On       August 31 two birds flew high overhead at Quoin Hill, proceeding in       the direction of Cowie Harbor. On November 24, large numbers at       Karindingen Island were sitting in mangroves and feeding on the       reefs around the island. Two birds were caught by the rising tide       while feeding on the reef and were unable to take off. One of these       was shot in approximately six to seven feet of water; its feathers       were completely waterlogged. Interestingly the flaky skin of the       crown had blue-green algae growing on it. These birds were heard       calling many times on the reef and in the mangroves; the call is       much like the deep growl of a dog.         Sims, Banks, and Harrison have found the storks common in this area       (Smythies, 1957:569). Although I could find no evidence of it,       possibly Karindingen Island is a nesting locality.    _=Anas querquedula=_ Linnaeus: Garganey.--_Specimen_, 1: Kg. Banjar:  sex? November 13, 1963, ADG 329.         This teal obtained by Garcia is our only record of any duck from       North Borneo.    _=Haliastur indus=_ (Boddaert): Brahminy Kite.--This common resident of  the Cocoa Research Station was observed almost daily while I was in the  field. It seemed to prefer the cleared areas replanted to cocoa and oil  palm and was common also at Tawau, Semporna, and Karindingen Island.    _=Accipiter trivirgatus microstictus=_ Mayr: Crested  Goshawk.--_Specimens_, 2: Pintasan Agriculture Station: [Male], October  17, 1963, ADG 314. Cocoa Research Station: [Male], April 30, 1963, ADG  89.    _=Spizaetus cirrhatus limnaetus=_ (Horsfield): Changeable  Hawk-eagle.--_Specimen_, 1: Tiger Estate: [Male], April 28, 1963, ADG 74  (Specimen in black phase).    _=Hieraetus kienerii formosus=_ (E. Geoffroy): Rufous-bellied  Hawk-eagle.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm., July  10, 1962, MCT 2615. Tiger Estate: [Female], July 13, 1962, MCT 2621.         The presence of an immature bird of this species in North Borneo       lends support to the suggestion of Smythies (1957:580) that this       species breeds in Borneo.    _fHaliaeetus leucogaster=_ (Gmelin): White-bellied Sea Eagle.--This  eagle appears to be fairly common along the coast in the Tawau-Darvel  Bay area. I saw it around Cowie Harbor, Tawau, Semporna, and Siamil  Island.    _=Spilornis cheela=_ Latham: Crested Serpent Eagle.--I saw this eagle  but once, circling overhead at the Cocoa Research Station on September  26, 1962.    _=Microhierax latifrons=_ Sharpe: White-fronted Falconet.--_Specimens_,  2: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm., 41.2 gm., July 6,  1962, MCT 2600. Tiger Estate: [Female] oviduct regressing, old brood  patch, December 1, 1962, MCT 3418.         This species was first seen at the Cocoa Research Station. The       specimen taken there bobbed its head in the manner of various other       falcons. On two occasions individuals were observed sitting in a       low tree in the front yard of a home in Kalabakan.         These records extend the known range of this species south from       Darvel Bay (Smythies, 1960:161) to Cowie Harbor.    _=Falco peregrinus japonensis=_ Gmelin: Peregrine Falcon.--_Specimen_,  1: Kampong Kuamut: [Male], October 20, 1963, ADG 327.    _=Coturnix chinensis=_ (Linnaeus): Painted Quail.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa  Research Station: [Male] testis 8 x 5 mm., September 6, 1962, MCT 2881.         This specimen is intermediate between _C. c. lineata_ and _C. c.       caerulescens_, tending slightly toward the latter in having more       rufous coloring on the tertials. R. E. Kuntz took a male at Ranau       (USNM 472504) that was also intermediate in its characters but was       referable to _C. c. lineata_. These two specimens, when compared       with series of specimens from the Philippines and Sumatra, fitted       into a clinal progression of increasingly rufous tertials toward       Sumatra. Peters (1934:96) united _C. c. caerulescens_ with _C. c.       palmeri_, but Amadon (in _litt._) retains _C. c. caerulescens_       (Smythies, 1957:588). No clear-cut distributional pattern is yet       discernible in North Borneo and the arrangement of Amadon (MS)       should probably be reviewed again when more specimens become       available.         These birds were observed several times at the Cocoa Research       Station but were difficult to collect. They were abundant in the       grasslands on the Brantian Estate.    _=Rollulus roulroul=_ (Scopoli): Crested Green Wood Partridge.--It was  observed once along the Apas River at the Cocoa Research Station, in  primary forest.    _=Haematortyx sanguiniceps=_ Sharpe: Crimson-headed Wood  Partridge.--Frederick Dunn saw one fly across the padang at the Cocoa  Research Station rest house on September 9.    _=Lophura ignita=_ (Shaw and Nodder): Crested Fireback  Pheasant.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], molting,  July 20, 1962, MCT 2624. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], November 4, 1962,  MCT 3206; [Male], November 7, 1962, MCT 3216.         This pheasant was taken in native snares from primary forest.    _=Lophura bulweri=_ (Sharpe): Bulwer's Pheasant.--_Specimens_, 3: 5.5  mi. SW Tenom: [Female], December 25, 1962, MCT 3534; [Male], December  27, 1962, MCT 3539; [Female], December 27, 1962, MCT 3540.         This bird was first taken in a snare 12 miles north of Kalabakan.       Unfortunately, the specimen was stolen and only its tail feathers       were brought in by the trappers. Mr. Comber of Sapong Estates in       Tenom said this species comes in numbers with the wild-pig       migration and that he had observed this at least three times. He       has also seen three-quarters grown young at Tenom, so they       seemingly nest there. They were found only in primary forest.         These specimens constitute the first records of the species for the       west coast of North Borneo (_cf._ Smythies, 1957:593).    _=Argusianus argus grayi=_ (Elliott): Great Argus  Pheasant.--_Specimens_, 6: 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], October 14, 1962,  MCT 3034; [Female], October 22, 1962, MCT 3121; [Male], October 23,  1962, MCT 3130; [Male], October 27, 1962, MCT 3166; [Female]?, October  29, 1962, MCT 3307. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Female], December 19, 1962, MCT  3464.         This species is a common resident of the primary forest at       Kalabakan and in the lower areas around Tenom (J. A. Comber, pers.       comm.). It is found only in primary forest.    _=Rallina fasciata=_ (Raffles): Malaysian Banded Crake.--_Specimen_, 1:  Tiger Estate: [Male], July 11, 1963, ADG 193.    _=Amaurornis phoenicurus javanicus=_ (Horsfield): White-breasted  Waterhen.--_Specimens_, 3: Tuaran: sex?, March 1, 1963, ADG 5. Telipok:  [Female], February 2, 1963, TM 23; [Male], February 2, 1963, TM 24.         This species was commonly observed in marshes near Tawau and on the       Brantian Estate.    _=Gallicrex"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#5)"],[1,"loins; cotton is a plant of which they  collect the flowers to make cloth of them; the coarser kind is called  KUPA, and the finer cloth T'IEH. They hold their markets at night,  and cover their faces.... At the east of this country is situated  the land of the Rakshas, which has the same customs as Poli.\"[7]    This is an interesting account in many ways, and tallies very  closely with what other evidence would lead one to suspect. For  there is reason to think that Bruni, before it became Mohammedan,  was a Bisaya kingdom under Buddhist sovereigns and Hindu influence;  and nearly all the particulars given with regard to the people of  Borneo are true of one or other of the races allied to Bisayas and  living near Bruni to-day. The discus-knife, a wooden weapon, is  not now in use, but is known to have been used formerly. The wild  Kadayans sacrifice after every new moon, and are forbidden to eat  a number of things until they have done so. The Malanaus set laden  rafts afloat on the rivers to propitiate the spirits of the sea. The  very names of the two kinds of cotton, then evidently a novelty to  the Chinese, are found in Borneo: KAPOK is a well-known Malay word;  but TAYA is the common name for cotton among the Sea Dayaks, though it  is doubtful whether it is found in Sumatra at all, and is not given  in Marsden's great Dictionary. The use of teeth as ear-ornaments  may refer to Kenyahs. If these identities are sufficient to show  that Poli was old Bruni, we have an almost unique illustration here  of the antiquity of savage customs. That an experience of fourteen  hundred years should have failed to convince people of the futility  of feeding salt waves is a striking demonstration of the widespread  fallacy, that what is old must needs be good.    Poli had already attained a certain measure of civilisation, and  even of luxury. The kingly dignity was hereditary, and the Buddhist  monarch was served with much ceremony. He was clad in flowered silk  or cotton, adorned with pearls, and sat on a golden throne attended  by servants with white dusters and fans of peacock feathers. When  he went out of his palace, his chariot, canopied with feathers and  embroidered curtains, was drawn by elephants, whilst gongs, drums,  and conches made inspiriting music. As Hindu ornaments have been found  at Santubong together with Chinese coins of great antiquity, as the  names of many offices of state in Bruni are derived from Sanskrit,  and the people of Sarawak have only lately ceased to speak of \"the  days of the Hindus,\"[8] there is nothing startling in the statement  that the kings of Poli were Buddhist.    Whatever Poli may or may not have been, there is little question  that Puni, 45 days from Java, 40 from Palembang, 30 from Champa,  in each case taking the wind to be fair, was Bruni. The Chinese, who  have neither B nor double consonants in their impoverished language,  still call the Bornean capital Puni. Groeneveldt says that the Chinese  consider Puni to have been on the west coast of Borneo. This state  is mentioned several times in the annals of the Sung dynasty, which,  though only ruling over Southern China, had a complete monopoly[9]  of the ocean trade for three centuries (960 to 1279 A.D.). Puni  was at that time a town of some 10,000 inhabitants, protected by  a stockade of timber. The king's palace, like the houses of modern  Bruni, was thatched with palm leaves, the cottages of the people with  grass. Warriors carried spears and protected themselves with copper  armour. When any native died, his corpse was exposed in the jungle,  and once a year for seven years sacrifices were made to the departed  spirit. Bamboos and palm leaves, thrown away after every meal, sufficed  for crockery. The products of the country, or at least such as were  sent as tribute, were camphor, tortoiseshell, and ivory.[10]    In the year 977, we are told, Hianzta, king of Puni, sent envoys  to China, who presented tribute with the following words: \"May the  emperor live thousands and tens of thousands of years, and may he not  disapprove of the poor civilities of my little country.\" The envoys  presented a letter from the king. This was written on' what looked like  the very thin bark of a tree; it was glossy, slightly green, several  feet long, and somewhat broader than one inch; the characters in which  it was written were small, and had to be read horizontally. In all  these particulars the letter resembled the books of magic which are  still written by the Battas of inland Sumatra.[11] The message ran:  \"The king of Puni, called Hianzta, prostrates himself before the most  august emperor, and hopes that the emperor may live ten thousands of  years. I have now sent envoys to carry tribute; I knew before that  there was an emperor, but I had no means of communication. Recently  there was a merchant called Pu Lu, whose ship arrived at the mouth  of my river; I sent a man to invite him to my place, and he told me  that he came from China. The people of my country were much delighted  at this, and preparing a ship, asked this stranger to guide them to  the court. The envoys I have sent only wish to see Your Majesty in  peace, and I intend to send people with tribute every year. But when  I do so I fear that my ships may occasionally be blown to Champa,  and I therefore hope Your Majesty will send an edict to that country  with orders that, if a ship of Hianzta arrives there, it must not  be detained. My country has no other articles,[12] and I pray Your  Majesty not to be angry with me.\" The envoys were entertained and  sent home with presents. In 1082 A.D., a hundred years later, Sri  Maja, king of Puni, sent tribute again, but the promise of yearly  homage was not kept. Gradually the Sung dynasty declined in power,  and East Indian potentates became less humble.    In the thirteenth and the early part of the fourteenth centuries  Bruni owed allegiance alternately to two powers much younger than  herself, Majapahit in Java, and Malacca on the west coast of the  Malay Peninsula. Both these states were founded in the thirteenth  century.[13] Majapahit, originally only one of several Javan kingdoms,  rapidly acquired strength and subjugated her neighbours and the nearest  portions of the islands around. Malacca, formed when the Malay colony  of Singapore was overwhelmed by Javanese, became the great commercial  depot of the Straits and the chief centre of Mohammedanism in the  Archipelago. The two powers therefore stood for two faiths and two  cultures: Majapahit for Brahminism and Hindu influence, Malacca for  Islam and the more practical civilisation of Arabia.    In the earliest years of the fourteenth century Bruni was a dependency  of Majapahit, but seems to have recovered its independence during the  minority of the Javan king. It is to this time that the tradition of  the Kapuas Malays ascribes the arrival of the Kayans in Borneo.[14]  Then Angka Wijaya extended the power of Majapahit over Palembang  in Sumatra, Timor, Ternate, Luzon, and the coasts of Borneo. Over  Banjermasin he set his natural son. In 1368 Javanese soldiers drove  from Bruni the Sulu marauders who had sacked the town. A few years  later the ungrateful king transferred his allegiance to China, and  not long afterwards, with calculating humility, paid tribute[15]  to Mansur Shah, who had succeeded to the throne of Malacca in 1374 A.D.    An extraordinary incident occurred at the beginning of the fifteenth  century, which again -- and for the last time -- draws our attention  to the Chinese court. The great Mongol conquerors, Genghis and Kublai  Khan, had little to do with the Malay Archipelago, though the latter  sent an unsuccessful expedition against Java in 1292. But the Ming  emperors, who were of Chinese blood, came to power in 1368 and soon  developed the maritime influence of the empire. For a few years there  was a continual stream of East Indian embassies. During the last  twenty years of the century, however, these became more rare, and in  1405 the Chinese emperor found it necessary to send a trusted eunuch,  by name Cheng Ho, to visit the vassal states in the south. This man  made several journeys, travelling as far as the shores of Africa,  and his mission bore immediate fruit. Among others, Maraja Kali,  king of Puni, although Cheng Ho does not appear to have called on  him in person, sent tribute in 1405; and so pleased was he with  the embroidered silk presented to him and his wife in return, that  he visited the Son of Heaven three years later. Landing in Fukien,  he was escorted by a eunuch to the Chinese capital amid scenes of  great rejoicing. The emperor received him in audience, allowing  him the honours of a noble of the first rank, and loaded him with  gifts. The same year, having accomplished his one great ambition of  \"seeing the face of the Son of Heaven,\" this humbled monarch died in  the imperial city, leaving his son Hiawang to succeed to the throne of  Puni. Having induced the emperor to stop the yearly tribute of forty  katties of camphor paid by Puni to Java, and having agreed to send  tribute to China every three years, Hiawang returned home to take up  the reins of government. Between 1410 and 1425 he paid tribute six  times, besides revisiting the Chinese Court; but afterwards little  Puni seems to have again ignored her powerful suzerain.    It is probable that the Chinese colony in North Borneo which gave  its name to the lofty mountain Kina Balu (Chinese widow) and to  the Kina Batangan, the chief river which flows from it, was founded  about this time. Several old writers seem to refer to this event,  and local traditions of the settlement still survive. The Brunis and  Idaans (a people in the north not unlike the Bisayas) have legends  differing in detail to the effect that the Chinese came to seize the  great jewel of the Kina Balu dragon, but afterwards quarrelled about  the booty and separated, some"]]]
