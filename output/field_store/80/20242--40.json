Passing by a large and almost complete collection of the separately  published works of Robin Greene, that unfortunate who bought a groat's  worth of wit with a million of repentance, we come to the Voyages and  Travels, and note, as before, the differences in prices.  Hakluyt's  'Collection of Voyages,' 2 vols., folio, 1589-99, brought L4. 14s. 6d.  (the Holding sale, January 17, 1895, L16; the Langham sale, June 19,  1894, L375, second edition, 3 vols., folio, which contained the map by  Molyneux, of which only twelve copies are known.  This copy belonged to  the first issue, without the cartouche about Sir Francis Drake, which  was subsequently added); 'Hakluytus Posthumus; or, Purchas his  Pilgrimes,' 5 vols., folio, 1625-26, L42 (the Toovey sale, February 26,  1894, L51); 'Sir Francis Drake Revived,' 1652, and 'The World  Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake,' 1652, the two pieces 7s. (the Hawley  sale, July 2, 1894, L6 5s.); 'Cooke's Voyages,' 8 vols., 4to., 1773-84,  with the large plates bound in two folio volumes, L63 (December 5, 1893,  at Christie's, L3 12s., and on many other occasions for about the same  amount); Eden's 'History of Travayle in the West and East Indies,'  London, 1577, L6 10s. (the Thornhill sale, April 15, 1889, L10 5s.; the  Wimpole Sale, June 29, 1888, L18 10s., original binding); Vancouver's  'Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean,' 3 vols., 4to., and  folio atlas of plates, 1798, L8 18s. (the Holding sale, January 17;  l895, L5 5s.).  It would be more than tedious to pursue this comparative  analysis further. Suffice it to say that as a rule the prices realized  in 1812 for books of travel were greater than would be realized now  under similar circumstances, especially when the journeys undertaken  were about the foot-worn Continent of Europe or in the various English  counties.  Pennant's 'Journey from Chester to London,' for example, is  now a book of small account, yet the Duke of Roxburghe's copy sold for  L7 15s.    Works relating to America are, curiously enough, almost absent from the  Duke's catalogue, and it may fairly be taken for granted that at the  beginning of the present century no one cared much about them.  This  will explain the extreme scarcity of many of these books now, for what  people think lightly of they take no care to preserve.  Hundreds and  thousands of Americana must have been torn to fragments or otherwise  destroyed in past days.  Often of small size, they would escape the  notice of lovers of folios, nor is their general appearance sufficiently  imposing to appeal to those who value a book strictly in proportion to  its external beauty.  The Duke had only a few works of travel in any way  relating to America, and as the list may be interesting, I have thought  it best to transcribe it _verbatim et literatim_:    Schmidel 'Navigatio in Americam,' 4to., _Norib._, 1599.  L1 6s.    Las Casas's 'Discoveries, etc., of the Spaniards in America,' _Lond._,  1699, 3s. 6d.    'History of the Bucaniers of America,' 4to., _Lond._, 1684, L2 6s.    Hennepin's 'Discoveries in America,' 8vo., _Lond._, 1698, 3s.    'Voyage dans l'Amerique,' par La Hontan, 2 vols., 8vo.  _La Haye_, 1703,  and 'Dialogues avec un Sauvage de l'Amerique,' par La Hontan, 8vo.,  _Amst._, 1704, the two volumes 7s. 6d.    Hontan's 'Voyages to North America,' 2 vols., 8vo., _Lond._, 1735, 6s.  6d.    Joutel's 'Voyage to the Missisippi,' 8vo., _Lond._, 1714, 4s.    Jones' 'Present State of Virginia,' 8vo., _Lond._ 1724, 2s.    Carver's 'Travels in N. America,' with plates, 8vo., _Lond._, 1778, 10s.    Long's 'Voyages and Travels in N. America,' 4to., _Lond._, 1791, 11s.  6d.    'Histoire des Antilles,' par Pere du Tertre, 3 vols., 4to., _Paris,_  1667, L2 2s.    Blome's 'Description of Jamaica,' etc., 8vo., _Lond._, 1678, 8s.    Gage's 'Travels in America and the W. Indies,' 8vo., _Lond._, 1699, 2s.  6d.    Wafer's 'Description of the Isthmus of America,' 8vo., _Lond._, 1699,  9s.    'Collectio Peregrinationum in Indiam Orientalem et in Indiam  Occidentalem, 19 partibus comprehensa, cum multis figuris Fratrum De  Bry, 4 vols., folio, _Francof._, L51 9s.    This 'Collectio Peregrinationum,' or Grands Voyages of Theodore de Bry,  nearly always makes its appearance in the auction-room in sections.  Nine of the parts, including the Additamentum, all first editions, with  the plates and maps, sold on July 1, 1895, for L18 10s.    And now we must take a final leave of the Duke of Roxburghe and the  collection which he got together during the course of a long life of  painstaking and critical research.  His catalogue is worth comparing  with several important records of the present day, but to do this  thoroughly would involve a tabulated analysis quite out of keeping with  a work such as I am engaged upon. There is magic in comparisons, for  they tell us what to avoid, and it may be that by their aid we could in  a measure take fashion by the forelock and jump the years to come.  Such  a consummation is possible, but life is rounded too narrowly by the  present, and therefore too short to make it worth anyone's while to  endeavour to peep into futurity.                                       *CHAPTER III.*                              *SOME LUCKY FINDS.*      The book-hunter whose heart is in his quest never tires of tales of  lucky discoveries, and of rare books bought for a song. This is natural  enough, and, moreover, authentic details of some great find invariably  stimulate his eagerness, and encourage him to persevere in the search  for what he is repeatedly being told--as though he of all men did not  know it already--is only to be met with casually, and by the merest of  accidents.  Now that all of us have settled among ourselves what books  are rare, and desirable to possess on that account, as well as for many  other reasons, everyone is, of course, naturally anxious to obtain the  credit and still more the solid advantages of a startling discovery.  It  is each man for himself, and that perhaps is the reason why book-men of  the old school invariably dressed in staid and sober black, like Sisters  of Charity, to show the world at large that charity in matters that  relate to their pursuit is dead.  What man among the whole fraternity  would give away his suspicions that, in such and such a place, something  may lie hidden?  Rather would he make his way to the spot, in fear lest  some other explorer might not, after all, have forestalled him, and  during his journey there look to the right and the left of him, and get  lost in crowds, as part of a deep design to shake off any other bookworm  who, knowing his hunting instincts and great experience, might perchance  be shadowing his footsteps.  It has, indeed, been seriously questioned  more than once by learned divines whether any collector, and more  especially a collector of books, can by any possibility reach the  kingdom of heaven, seeing that the inestimable gift of charity is by him  regarded of such little account that he would do anything rather than  practise it. It were best, however, to leave such polemical discussions  to those who take an interest in them, and content ourselves with saying  that the bookman's ways are necessarily tortuous, and his route through  life circuitous.    It is next to impossible to open any book about books without meeting  with instances of lucky finds, and the most curious part of the matter  is that the stories are invariably more or less the same.  Like the  literary man's collection of stock phrases, which he uses with or  without variation as occasion may require, and at judicious intervals,  so these records of the chase strike us as being peculiarly liable to  recur.  From their opening sentences we know them--nay, the very mention  of a place or a name is often sufficient to make an adept take up his  parable and finish the narration.  Let a man but whisper Hungerford  Market, and we know that he is going to tell us of the fishmonger's shop  where about half a century ago 'autograph signatures of Godolphin,  Sunderland, Ashley, Lauderdale, Ministers of James II.; Accounts of the  Exchequer Office, signed by Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; Wardrobe  Accounts of Queen Anne; Secret Service Accounts, marked with the \"E.G.\"  of Nell Gwynne; a treatise on the Eucharist, in the boyish hand of  Edward VI.; and a disquisition on the Order of the Garter in the  scholarly writing of Elizabeth,' were rescued from the eaters of fried  plaice, and the tender mercies of the barbaric tradesman who supplied  them.  Mr. Rogers Rees, of 'Diversions of a Bookworm' fame, got this  story from somewhere, though he perhaps would not know it now, for it  has been altered and added to in a score or more of competing  publications.  Then there are stories of Resbecque, who had a nose for a  book second to that of no hound for a fox, of Naude, Colbert, the great  Pixerecourt, and many more.  It would be a shame to dish up these plats  again, for to make them palatable they would have to be seasoned with  imaginative details--an objectionable, not to say fraudulent, practice  at its best.    There is one story, however, which must be raked up, and then decently  buried again, for it is to be hoped that we shall hear no more of it.  It is perhaps not so well known as many of the rest, but in any case  would not be mentioned here except as an almost unique illustration of  the vicissitudes to which any book, however scarce and valuable it may  be, is occasionally liable.  It is, stripped of its glosses, to the  following effect: When the library at Thorneck Hall was weeded of its  superfluous books, the butler, who superintended the operation, came  across a perfect copy of Dame Juliana Berners' 'Boke of St. Albans,'  printed by an unknown typographer in 1486. One would have thought that  the quaintness of the type, to say"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#5)"],[1,"fifteen days' halt, and engaged       the enemy on six different occasions.         \"The column under Lieutenant-General Ian Hamilton marched 400       miles in forty-five days, including ten days' halt. It was       engaged with the enemy twenty-eight times.         \"The flying column under the command of Colonel B. Mahon, which       relieved Mafeking, marched at the rate of nearly fifteen miles       a day for fourteen consecutive days, and successfully       accomplished its object, despite the determined opposition       offered by the enemy.         \"The newly raised battalion of the City of London Imperial       Volunteers marched 500 miles in fifty-four days, only once       having two consecutive days' halt. It took part in twenty-six       engagements with the enemy.         \"During the recent operations the sudden variations in       temperature between the warm sun in the daytime and the bitter       cold at night have been peculiarly trying to the troops, and       owing to the necessity for rapid movement the soldiers have       frequently had to bivouac after long and trying marches without       firewood and with scanty rations.         \"The cheerful spirit in which these difficulties have been       overcome and hardships disregarded are deserving of the highest       praise, and in thanking all ranks for the successful efforts to       obtain the objects in view, Lord Roberts is proud to think that       the soldiers under his command have worthily upheld the       traditions of her Majesty's army in fighting, in marching, and       in the admirable discipline which has been maintained       throughout a period of no ordinary trial and difficulty.        (Signed) ROBERTS, Field-Marshal.\"    As may be imagined, the man who could accomplish so much in so short a  span of time remained unperturbed by a vision of clouds on the horizon.  He knew that though with the fall of Pretoria the campaign nominally  ended, there were many minor passages at arms to be expected in various  parts of the two Republics. There were the remnants of Botha's army to  north and east; there were De Wet and his marauders playing havoc with  lines and telegraph wires, prowling in search of ill-defended convoys,  and inspirited to fresh deeds of aggression by the successful capture of  Colonel Spragge's Yeomanry; there were Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp to be  occupied by Sir Archibald Hunter, and Griqualand to be finally pacified  by Sir Charles Warren.    [Illustration: MAP OF THE SEAT OF WAR.]    Still, it was unpleasant to receive the report that while the main army  had been advancing, an immense force of Boers, through a series of  unfortunate mistakes, had succeeded in capturing in the vicinity of  Vredefort Road, a convoy and an escort of a company and a half of  Highlanders on its way to Heilbron. The outline of the unhappy affair was  painful in the extreme. As the mysterious circumstances attending the  movements of the convoy have not yet been fully sifted, it would be  unfair to accept the numerous criticisms offered on the subject, and  details regarding the capture are so lost in the \"fog of war,\" that it is  difficult to give an account of the series of muddles that brought about  disaster. It appeared that though the enemy were lurking everywhere the  convoy was travelling from Winburg under escort of only a company and a  half \"odd\" men of the Brigade with orders to pick it up at Kroonstad,  which place was subsequently changed to Heilbron. At Vredefort the party  were to leave the rail and go by road; but shortly it received orders to  await an escort that was being sent from Heilbron. General Hector  MacDonald wired that it should not proceed further till escorted by a  strong force of mounted troops, infantry, and artillery, as he himself,  during his five days' march, had been repeatedly in collision with the  foe. The officer in command laagered up. Next day an orderly reconnoitred  and failed to detect the presence of the enemy. Suspicion had been  aroused, however, by the disappearance of a Colonial conductor, who, it  seems, used the occasion to report to De Wet, who promptly seized the  time and the opportunity. He sent in with a flag of truce a terse  message, \"I have 1200 men and five guns. Surrender at once.\" An hour  earlier Major Haig with 600 men, marching from Vredefort Road, had got to  within two miles of the convoy, but hearing that the railhead was  threatened had turned back. The convoy was therefore at De Wet's mercy,  and he knew it. He refused to give any terms, so the small party  capitulated! General Hector MacDonald, in defence of his Highlanders, who  were evidently not at fault, gave a concise account of the circumstances  attending the misadventure--an account more trustworthy than those of  outsiders--         \"While the Brigade was at Wynberg, a company of the Black Watch       was sent as escort to a convoy of pom-pom ammunition to       Smalldeel railway station, and a day or two later half a       company of Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders with captured arms       and ammunition, and we were informed that they would join us at       Kroonstad. The Brigade, however, instead of going to Kroonstad,       marched by way of Ventersburg and Lindley to Heilbron, while       the detached companies marched by the railway to Roodeval. As       we were opposed--practically surrounded--for the last five days       of our march, a wire was sent to Smalldeel not to send in a       convoy until it could be escorted by a strong force of mounted       troops, infantry, and artillery. The Commandant at Smalldeel,       however, sent away the convoy under escort of the company and a       half of Highlanders, with the result that it was captured.       Perhaps the Commandant was acting under orders from the army       headquarters, and that remains to be seen.\"    Certain it was that the Highland Brigade, who had already been subsisting  on frugal, one may say starvation, fare was left in a sorry plight, and  fully appreciated the significance of the saying that too many cooks will  spoil the broth. On the shoulders of which of the cooks the blame will  eventually rest remains to be seen.    It was the opinion of some that sufficient precautions were not taken to  insure the expedition's transmission of supplies, and the entrenchment  and strong fortification of small bodies of troops sent to guard the line  of rail; and also that there was an insufficiently co-ordinated system of  intelligence, in consequence of which commanding officers moving with  detached forces were without definite information regarding the movements  and destination of other forces, friendly or inimical, which might have  to be encountered.    The mishaps of Sanna's Post--the capture of the Yeomanry and other  corps--were thought to have been occasioned by the absence of a general  staff--a general staff trained by years of practice to the exigencies of  life in the field. Such a staff of trained and picked officers was  educated by Napoleon for his use under his personal supervision, while  Lord Roberts, with a gigantic army of 200,000 men, had a merely  improvised machine. He had certainly Lord Kitchener at his elbow, but  this officer's duties developed into those of the \"handy-man\"--now  organiser, now fighter, now administrator in rebellious districts--thus  depriving the Chief of the clockwork apparatus that should be represented  by the General Staff, at a time when generals and troops, like engines  and railway carriages, had to be timed to arrive and depart from stations  on the hard-and-fast principles of Bradshaw.    At this date with Lord Roberts in Pretoria were two and a half infantry  divisions, a cavalry division, and a mounted infantry division, Wavell's  Brigade having been left at Johannesburg, while the other half proceeded  to the Capital.    General Hunter's Division, joined by Colonel Mahon's force, was operating  at Ventersdorp, while Colonel Plumer without opposition occupied Zeerust,  the officials agreeing to take the oath provided they were protected from  their fellow-countrymen. Elsewhere, across the Orange River Colony, the  troops were fairly well expanded. General Colvile with the Highland  Brigade was near Heilbron, and south of him Lord Methuen, while at  Lindley was General Paget. At Senekal and Hammonia were General Clements  and General Rundle respectively. South of these again, Generals Chermside  and Brabant were operating.    It was imagined that the combined vigilance of these officers had  entirely protected the communications in the Orange River Colony, but on  the 7th of June the unquenchable Dutchmen succeeded in cutting line and  telegraph wire north of Kroonstad, and in taking prisoners most of the  4th Battalion of the Derbyshires (Sherwood Foresters), who were guarding  the district. Of the battalion, the Colonel, a lieutenant, and  thirty-four rank and file were killed, five officers and ninety-nine men  were wounded, and the rest, save six, made prisoners!    The story ran thus: At dusk on the 4th, the Derbyshire Militia Regiment  arrived at Roodeval and pitched their camp in the lee of a string of  kopjes that shelved away to the west, and terminated in a high hump  which, jutting out of the plain, commanded rail, camp, and the  surrounding hills. Owing to the darkness it was impossible to do much in  the way of reconnoitring, and though some scouts and natives warned the  commanding officers that Boers had been espied in the vicinity, little  notice was taken. The pickets, which had been posted on a range of  kopjes north of the camp, were strengthened, and some few shots fired at  distant snipers. Then the party laid themselves down to rest, and slept  placidly. Before dawn they were awakened by the furious crackling of  musketry, and even as the men turned out with their rifles, they dropped.  One after another as they left their tents fell"]]]
