Randolph, Wickham, Campbell, Call, Pendleton, Wythe--these are names  whose fame still survives wherever the history of the American Bar is  cherished; and it was with their living bearers that young Marshall now  entered into competition. The result is somewhat astonishing at first  consideration, for even by the standards of his own day, when digests,  indices, and the other numerous aids which now ease the path of the  young attorney were generally lacking, his preparation had been slight.  Several circumstances, however, came to his rescue. So soon after the  Revolution British precedents were naturally rather out of favor, while  on the other hand many of the questions which found their way into  the courts were those peculiar to a new country and so were without  applicable precedents for their solution. What was chiefly demanded of  an attorney in this situation was a capacity for attention, the ability  to analyze an opponent's argument, and a discerning eye for fundamental  issues. Competent observers soon made the discovery that young Marshall  possessed all these faculties to a marked degree and, what was just as  important, his modesty made recognition by his elders easy and gracious.    From 1782 until the adoption of the Constitution, Marshall was almost  continuously a member of the Virginia Legislature. He thus became a  witness of that course of policy which throughout this period daily  rendered the state governments more and more \"the hope of their enemies,  the despair of their friends.\" The termination of hostilities against  England had relaxed the already feeble bonds connecting the  States. Congress had powers which were only recommendatory, and its  recommendations were ignored by the local legislatures. The army, unpaid  and frequently in actual distress, was so rapidly losing its morale that  it might easily become a prey to demagogues. The treaties of the  new nation were flouted by every State in the Union. Tariff wars and  conflicting land grants embittered the relations of sister States. The  foreign trade of the country, it was asserted, \"was regulated, taxed,  monopolized, and crippled at the pleasure of the maritime powers  of Europe.\" Burdened with debts which were the legacy of an era of  speculation, a considerable part of the population, especially of the  farmer class, was demanding measures of relief which threatened the  security of contracts. \"Laws suspending the collection of debts,  insolvent laws, instalment laws, tender laws, and other expedients of a  like nature, were familiarly adopted or openly and boldly vindicated. *       * This review of conditions under the later Confederation is  taken from Story's \"Discourse,\" which is in turn based, at this point,  on Marshall's \"Life of Washington\" and certain letters of his to Story.      From the outset Marshall ranged himself on the side of that party  in the Virginia Legislature which, under the leadership of Madison,  demanded with growing insistence a general and radical constitutional  reform designed at once to strengthen the national power and to curtail  state legislative power. His attitude was determined not only by his  sympathy for the sufferings of his former comrades in arms and by his  veneration for his father and for Washington, who were of the same  party, but also by his military experience, which had rendered  the pretensions of state sovereignty ridiculous in his eyes. Local  discontent came to a head in the autumn of 1786 with the outbreak of  Shays's Rebellion in western Massachusetts. Marshall, along with the  great body of public men of the day, conceived for the movement the  gravest alarm, and the more so since he considered it as the natural  culmination of prevailing tendencies. In a letter to James Wilkinson  early in 1787, he wrote: \"These violent... dissensions in a State I had  thought inferior in wisdom and virtue to no one in our Union, added to  the strong tendency which the politics of many eminent characters among  ourselves have to promote private and public dishonesty, cast a deep  shade over that bright prospect which the Revolution in America and  the establishment of our free governments had opened to the votaries  of liberty throughout the globe. I fear, and there is no opinion more  degrading to the dignity of man, that those have truth on their side who  say that man is incapable of governing himself.\"    Marshall accordingly championed the adoption of the Constitution of 1787  quite as much because of its provisions for diminishing the legislative  powers of the States in the interest of private rights as because of  its provisions for augmenting the powers of the General Government. His  attitude is revealed, for instance, in the opening words of his first  speech on the floor of the Virginia Convention, to which he had been  chosen a member from Richmond: \"Mr. Chairman, I conceive that the object  of the discussion now before us is whether democracy or despotism be  most eligible.... The supporters of the Constitution claim the title of  being firm friends of liberty and the rights of man ....We prefer this  system because we think it a well-regulated democracy.... What are the  favorite maxims of democracy? A strict observance of justice and public  faith.... Would to Heaven that these principles had been observed under  the present government. Had this been the case the friends of liberty  would not be willing now to part with it.\" The point of view which  Marshall here assumed was obviously the same as that from which Madison,  Hamilton, Wilson, and others on the floor of the Federal Convention had  freely predicted that republican liberty must disappear from the  earth unless the abuses of it practiced in many of the States could be  eliminated.    Marshall's services in behalf of the Constitution in the closely fought  battle for ratification which took place in the Virginia Convention  are only partially disclosed in the pages of Elliot's \"Debates.\" He was  already coming to be regarded as one excellent in council as well as in  formal discussion, and his democratic manners and personal popularity  with all classes were a pronounced asset for any cause he chose to  espouse. Marshall's part on the floor of the Convention was, of course,  much less conspicuous than that of either Madison or Randolph, but in  the second rank of the Constitution's defenders, including men like  Corbin, Nicholas, and Pendleton, he stood foremost. His remarks were  naturally shaped first of all to meet the immediate necessities of the  occasion, but now and then they foreshadow views of a more enduring  value. For example, he met a favorite contention of the opposition by  saying that arguments based on the assumption that necessary powers  would be abused were arguments against government in general and \"a  recommendation of anarchy.\" To Henry's despairing cry that the proposed  system lacked checks, he replied: \"What has become of his enthusiastic  eulogium of the American spirit? We should find a check and control,  when oppressed, from that source. In this country there is no exclusive  personal stock of interest. The interest of the community is blended and  inseparably connected with that of the individual.... When we consult  the common good, we consult our own.\" And when Henry argued that a  vigorous union was unnecessary because \"we are separated by the sea  from the powers of Europe,\" Marshall replied: \"Sir, the sea makes them  neighbors of us.\"    It is worthy of note that Marshall gave his greatest attention to  the judiciary article as it appeared in the proposed Constitution. He  pointed out that the principle of judicial independence was here better  safeguarded than in the Constitution of Virginia. He stated in one  breath the principle of judicial review and the doctrine of enumerated  powers. If, said he, Congress \"make a law not warranted by any of  the powers enumerated, it would be considered by the judges as an  infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard; they would  not consider such a law as coming within their jurisdiction. They would  declare it void.\" * On the other hand, Marshall scoffed at the idea that  the citizen of a State might bring an original action against another  State in the Supreme Court. His dissections of Mason's and Henry's  arguments frequently exhibit controversial skill of a high order. From  Henry, indeed, Marshall drew a notable tribute to his talent, which was  at the same time proof of his ability to keep friends with his enemies.       * J. Elliot, \"Debates\" (Edition of 1836), vol. III, p. 503. As to  Bills of Rights, however, Marshall expressed the opinion that they were  meant to be \"merely recommendatory. Were it otherwise, ...many laws  which are found convenient would be unconstitutional.\" Op. cit.,  vol. III, p. 509.      On the day the great Judiciary Act became law, Marshall attained  his thirty-fourth year. His stride toward professional and political  prominence was now rapid. At the same time his private interests were  becoming more closely interwoven with his political principles and  personal affiliations, and his talents were maturing. Hitherto his  outlook upon life had been derived largely from older men, but his own  individuality now began to assert itself; his groove in life was taking  final shape.    The best description of Marshall shows him in the prime of his manhood  a few months after his accession to the Supreme Bench. It appears in  William Wirt's celebrated \"Letters of the British Spy\":    \"The [Chief Justice] of the United States is, in his person, tall,  meager, emaciated; his muscles relaxed, and his joints so loosely  connected, as not only to disqualify him, apparently for any vigorous  exertion of body, but to destroy everything like elegance and harmony in  his air and movements. Indeed, in his whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#5)"],[1," determined, however, to take with him two of  his own hands; the one a strong active young fellow named Bill Harrison,  the other a middle-aged man named Johnson, who had been with him from a  boy.  He was a married man with two girls, aged fifteen and sixteen, the  eldest of whom was already employed by Mrs Humphreys in the house.  Johnson's wife was a superior woman of her class, and Mr Humphreys  thought that it would be pleasant for his wife, having a woman at hand,  whom she could speak to.  The girls were to act as servants--indeed Mr  Humphreys thought it probable that the whole party would live under one  roof.    Among those whom Mr Humphreys' decision to emigrate had much moved was  Mr Jackson.  He was not in so good a position, as he did not farm his  own land; but he had sufficient capital to start him well in the colony,  where a farm can be bought outright at a few shillings an acre.  He  talked the matter over with his friend on several occasions, and at last  said--    \"Well, I think I have pretty well made up my mind; the doctor is telling  me that my poor little chap is not likely to live long; his mother is  wrapped up in him, and will never like the place again;--so I think on  all grounds a change will be good.  I can't come out with you, because I  have got a lease of the farm; but I fancy that it is worth more than it  was when I took it, and if I can get a good tenant to take it off my  hands I don't suppose the landlord will make any objections.  I shall  look about at once, and, when my poor little chap is gone, I shan't be  long before I come after you.  You will let me know how you find the  place, and whether these book-accounts are true?--I have heard that many  of these chaps who write books are awful liars.  I should like to get a  farm as near you as may be.\"    It was early in the spring when Mr Humphreys and his party embarked at  Plymouth in the _Dunster Castle_.  The farm had sold well, and Mr  Humphreys possessed a capital of several thousand pounds--a sum which  would make him a rich man in the colony.  None of the party had ever  seen the sea before, and the delight of the two boys and the wonderment  of the labourers at all they saw was very great.  Mr Humphreys had  taken first-class passages for himself and family, while the others of  course were steerage passengers.    CHAPTER THREE.    THE FARM.    The voyage to the Cape passed without any incident whatever.  The  weather was fine the whole distance.  Without even a single storm to  break the monotony they touched at Capetown and Port Elizabeth, and at  last arrived at Durban.  The journey had not been too long for the boys;  everything was so perfectly new to them that they were never tired of  watching the sea and looking for porpoises and the shoals of fish, over  which hovered thousands of birds.    Once or twice they saw a whale spout, while flying-fish were matters of  hourly occurrence.  They had prodigious appetites, and greatly enjoyed  the food, which was altogether different to that to which they had been  accustomed.  They had stopped at Madeira and St Vincent, where great  stocks of delicious fruit had been taken on board.  Altogether they were  quite sorry when they arrived at the end of the voyage.    The landing was effected in large boats, as the _Dunster Castle_ drew  too much water to cross the bar at the mouth of the harbour.    They stopped only one day at Durban, where Mr Humphreys hired a waggon  to take the party to Pieter-Maritzburg, the capital.  He was not  encumbered with baggage, as he had decided to buy everything he wanted  in the colony.    \"You may pay dearer,\" he said, \"no doubt; but then you get just what you  want.  If I were to take out implements, they might not be suited to the  requirements of the country.  As for clothes, they would of course be  pretty much the same everywhere; still, it is better to take out only a  year's requirements and to buy as we want, instead of lumbering over the  country with a quantity of heavy baggage.\"    The party were greatly amused at their first experience of a Cape  waggon; it was of very large size, massively built, and covered with a  great tilt; and it was drawn by sixteen oxen, spanned two by two.  This  was an altogether unnecessary number for the weight which had to be  carried, but the waggon had come down loaded from the interior, and Mr  Humphreys therefore paid no more than he would have done for a waggon  with a small number of oxen.  They took two days to accomplish the  journey, the women sleeping at night in the waggon, and Mr Humphreys  and his sons in blankets on the ground.    The driver, who was an Englishman, had been many years in the colony,  and from him, upon the road, Mr Humphreys gained much valuable  information about the country.  The driver was assisted by two Kaffirs,  one of whom walked ahead of the leading cattle, the other alongside,  shouting and prodding them.    The boys were astonished at the power and accuracy with which the driver  whirled his whip; this had a short handle and a lash of twenty yards  long, and with it he was able to hit any animal of the team with  absolute certainty, and indeed to make the thong alight on any part of  their bodies at which he aimed.    On their arrival at Pieter-Maritzburg Mr Humphreys hired a house, and  here he placed his party while he set to work to make inquiries after a  suitable location.  He soon heard of several places which seemed  suitable, and having bought a horse started for Newcastle, a small town  situated close to the frontier-line between the Transvaal and Natal.    He was away for three weeks, and on his return informed his wife that he  had purchased a farm of 2000 acres, with a substantial farmhouse, at a  distance of ten miles from Newcastle, for the sum of 1500 pounds.    The farmhouse was already roughly furnished, but Mr Humphreys purchased  a number of other articles, which would make it comfortable and  home-like.  He laid in a great stock of groceries, and then hiring a  waggon, similar to that in which they had before travelled, started with  his party for the farm, having also hired four Kaffirs to assist there.  Travelling by easy stages, it took them twelve days to get to Newcastle.  The country was undulating and the road rose steadily the whole  distance.    Near Pieter-Maritzburg the population was comparatively thick.  The  fields were well cultivated and the vegetation thick and luxuriant, but  as they ascended the character of the country changed.  Vast stretches  of rolling grass everywhere met the eye.  This was now beautifully  green, for it was winter.  In the summer and autumn the grass becomes  dry and burnt up; fire is then applied to it, and the whole country  assumes a black mantle.  But the first shower of rain brings up the  young grass and in a very short time the country is covered with fresh  verdure.    Mr Humphreys told his wife that, before fixing on the farm, he had  ridden into the Transvaal, and found that land could be purchased there  even more cheaply than in Natal; but that he had much conversation with  English settlers on the frontier, and these had for the most part  strongly advised him to settle inside the Natal frontier.    \"It may be that all will be right,\" one had told him, \"but the Boers  have not yet recovered from their scare from Secoceni.\"    \"Who is Secoceni, father?\"  Dick asked.  \"The books we have say nothing  about him.\"    \"No,\" Mr Humphreys said; \"they were all published a few years since,  and none of them treat much of the affairs of the Transvaal, which, as  an independent state, had comparatively little interest to English  settlers.  There are in the Transvaal, which is of immense extent, a  very large number of natives, enormously outnumbering the Boers.  In the  southern districts, where the Boers are strongest, they cruelly  ill-treat the natives, making slaves of them, and thinking no more of  shooting one of them down than they would of shooting a dog.  In the  outlying provinces they live almost on sufferance of the natives, and,  were these to unite their forces and rise, they could annihilate the  Dutch.  Secoceni is a powerful chief, who lives with his tribe in a  natural stronghold; he has always held himself as independent of the  Dutch.  As his men used to make raids upon the Boers' cattle, the latter  attacked him, and in alliance with Swazis, another powerful tribe,  endeavoured to carry his fortress; they were, however, badly beaten; it  being only by the gallantry of their native allies that the Boer  contingent was saved from destruction.  Secoceni then took the  offensive.  A perfect panic seized the Boers; they refused to obey the  orders of their government, and to turn out to resist the invaders.  The  treasury was empty, for their government had never been enabled to  persuade them to pay taxes.  They applied for aid to Natal, but finally  their plight was so bad that they were glad to accept the offer which  Mr Shepstone made them, of annexation to England, by which they secured  our protection and were safe from annihilation.  Secoceni was not the  only enemy who threatened them.  They had a still more formidable foe in  the Zulus on the eastern frontier.  These are a very warlike people, and  it was known that their king meditated the conquest of the Transvaal.  But, glad enough as the Boers were at the moment to accept the  protection of England, now that the danger is over a great many of them  would like to kick down the bridge which has helped them over the  stream.  They make no secret of their dislike to Englishmen, and  although they are glad enough to sell their land at prices immensely in  advance of the former value, for indeed land was previously almost  unsaleable in the Transvaal, they are on bad terms with them.  One of my  informants describes them as a sullen, sulky people, and predicts that  sooner or later we shall have trouble with"]]]
