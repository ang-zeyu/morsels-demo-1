The storms of winter raged  around me; the wind shook the forest, the wolf howled in the  distance, and the owl chimed in harshly to complete the doleful  music which seemed to soothe me, or bid me welcome to this holy  retreat. But in my little cabin the fire blazed pleasantly, and the  Holy Scriptures and a few other books occupied my hours of  solitude. Among the few books in my cabin, were McKenzie's travels  in the Northwest, and Lewis and Clark's tour up the Missouri and  down the Columbia rivers.    Spring came on again; the woods were pleasant, the flowers  bloomed in their richest variety, the birds sung pleasantly in the  groves; and, strange to say, my mind had become attached to my new  abode. I again bargained for a piece of forest land; again promised  to pay in a few years, and again commenced to clear a farm and  build a house.    I was now twenty years of age.    I resolved to make some improvements and preparations, and then  return to my native country, from which I had been absent several  years. There was one there whom my heart had long loved, and from  whom I would not have been so long separated, except by misfortune.      CHAPTER IV.  ------------------------    Revisit Canaan, N. T.:--Interesting Meeting:--  Marriage:--Return to my Forest Home.    It was the Fourth of July, 1827. The morning was beautiful and  gay, the sun rose without a cloud over the pine-clad hills of my  native land, where in boyhood I had often toiled and sported, just  as I came within a mile of the farm of my good old aunt Van Cott,  of Canaan, Columbia County, after an absence of three years. I had,  during this time, exchanged the features of the bashful boy for  those of the man; and, instead of a laughing, careless countenance,  a forehead of marble and a cheek of rose, stern care had marked me  as her child, and the sun had given a shade of brown to my  features; these, added to a heavy growth of beard and whiskers,  disguised me so far that I could pass through the neighborhood of  people, known and familiar to me, unnoticed and unknown.    With a quick step, a beating heart, and an intense,  indescribable feeling of joy, sorrow, hope, despondency and  happiness, I approached the door of Mr. Halsey, and knocked; it was  opened by an aged female, a stranger to me; I entered and inquired  for Miss Thankful Halsey-in a moment more she had me by the hand,  with a look of welcome which showed she had not forgotten me.    I spent the day and evening with her; explained to her all my  losses, my poverty and prospects, and the lone retreat where I had  spent the previous winter; and the preparations I had made for a  future home. I also opened my religious views to her, and my  desire, which I sometimes had, to try and teach the red man.    \"In view of all these things,\" said I to her, \"If you still love  me and desire to share my fortune you are worthy to be my wife. If  not, we will agree to be friends forever; but part to meet no more  in time.\" \"I have loved you during three years' absence,\" said she,  \"and I never can be happy without you.\"    I repaired to my aunt's--found the usual welcome. After visiting  my mother and kindred, for a few days, I saw my old friend, William  S. Herrick, where I had been employed five years before. He was  very anxious to employ me again; and finding I was willing, he  discharged a hand he had already, and gave me double wages. I  remained in his employ till October, and found the same kind  reception as formerly.    On the 9th of September, 1827, Parley P. Pratt and Thankful  Halsey were solemnly united in the bonds of matrimony, by Elder  Palmer, Minister of the Baptist Church, in Canaan, Columbia County,  N. Y.    In October we took leave of our friends in Canaan and took  passage for the West. We hired a conveyance to Albany, and then  took passage for Buffalo on a canal boat; and from there on board a  schooner; passing up Lake Erie we landed in safety at the mouth of  Black River, in Ohio, and within ten miles of my place. My wife had  some money, which we paid in for the land I had purchased. The  following spring found me 21 years of age, married and settled in a  log dwelling, in the midst of a small clearing made with my own  hands, in the place where I had spent the previous winter in  solitude.      CHAPTER V.  ------------------------    Our Home:--New Sect:--Progressive Religious  Views:--Unexpected Meeting:--Dialogue:--Forsake My  Home:--Journey to New York:--Public Ministry:--Strange  Book:--First Interview with a Latter-Day Saint.    Eighteen months had passed since our settlement in the  wilderness. The forest had been displaced by the labors of the  first settlers for some distance around our cottage. A small frame  house was now our dwelling, a garden and a beautiful meadow were  seen in front, flowers in rich profusion were clustering about our  door and windows; while in the background were seen a thriving  young orchard of apple and peach trees, and fields of grain  extending in the distance, beyond which the forest still stood tip  in its own primeval grandeur, as a wall to bound the vision and  guard the lovely scene. Other houses and farms were also in view,  and some twenty children were returning from the school actually  kept by my wife, upon the very spot where two years before I had  lived for months without seeing a human being. About this time one  Mr. Sidney Rigdon came into the neighborhood as a preacher, and it  was rumored that he was a kind of Reformed Baptist, who, with Mr.  Alexander Campbell, of Virginia, a Mr. Scott, and some other gifted  men, had dissented from the regular Baptists, from whom they  differed much in doctrine. At length I went to hear him, and what  was my astonishment when I found he preached faith in Jesus Christ,  repentance towards God, and baptism for remission of sins, with the  promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost to all who would come  forward, with all their hearts, and obey this doctrine!    Here was the _ancient gospel_ in due form. Here were the  very principles which I had discovered years before; but could find  no one to minister in. But still one great link was wanting to  complete the chain of the ancient order of things; and that was,  the _authority_ to minister in holy things--the apostleship,  the power which should accompany the form. This thought occurred to  me as soon as I heard Mr. Rigdon make proclamation of the gospel.    Peter proclaimed this gospel, and baptized for remission of  sins, and promised the gift of the Holy Ghost, because he was  commissioned so to do by a crucified and risen Saviour. But who is  Mr. Rigdon? Who is Mr. Campbell? Who commissioned them? Who  baptized them for remission of sins? Who ordained them to stand up  as Peter? Of course they were baptized by the Baptists, and  ordained by them, and yet they had now left them because they did  not administer the true gospel. And it was plain that the Baptists  could not claim the apostolic office by succession, in a regular,  unbroken chain from the Apostles of old, preserving the gospel in  its purity, and the ordinances unchanged, from the very fact that  they were now living in the perversion of some, and the entire  neglect of others of these ordinances; this being the very ground  of difference between the old Baptists and these Reformers.    Again, these Reformers claimed no new commission by revelation,  or vision from the Lord, while they had not the least shadow of  claim by succession.    It might be said, then, with propriety: \"Peter I know, and Paul  I know, but who are ye?\"    However, we were thankful for even the forms of truth, as none  could claim the power, and authority, and gifts of the Holy  Ghost--at least so far as we knew.    After hearing Mr. Rigdon several times, I came out, with a  number of others, and embraced the truths which he taught. We were  organized into a society, and frequently met for public worship.    About this time I took it upon me to impart to my neighbors,  from time to time, both in public and in private, the light I had  received from the Scriptures concerning the gospel, and also  concerning the fulfilment of the things spoken by the holy  prophets. I did not claim any authority as a minister; I felt the  lack in this respect; but I felt in duty bound to enlighten  mankind, so far as God had enlightened me.    At the commencement of 1830, I felt drawn out in an  extraordinary manner to search the prophets, and to pray for an  understanding of the same. My prayers were soon answered, even  beyond my expectations; the prophecies of the holy prophets were  opened to my view; I began to understand the things which were  coming on the earth the restoration of Israel, the coming of the  Messiah, and the glory that should follow. I was so astonished at  the darkness of myself and mankind on these subjects that I could  exclaim with the prophet: surely, \"_darkness covers the earth,  and gross darkness the people_.\"    I was all swallowed up in these things. I felt constrained to  devote my time in enlightening my fellow men on these important  truths, and in warning them to prepare for the coming of the Lord.    My brother William, who journeyed to the West with me in my  seventeenth year, had now been missing to the family for five  years, and was supposed to be dead. About the time he disappeared  and was lost sight of, he was known to leave the city of New York,  where he had been employed, and to pass up the Hudson on a steamer.  He was heard of no more; and, as a notice appeared in the papers of  the same date that a young gentleman by the name of William Pratt  was drowned in the Hudson, on his way up the river, our parents and  the family had given him up for lost.    One morning, as I was absent from home on business, about two  miles distant, I heard of him; and that he was then residing about  ten miles from me.

Then follows a closer analysis of the qualities possessed by  pathological liars: (a) Their range of ideas is wide.  (b) Their  range of interests is wider than would be expected from their  grade of education.  (c) Their perceptions are better than the  average.  (d) They are nimble witted.  Their oral and written  style is above normal in fluency.  (e) They exhibit faultiness in  the development of conceptions and judgments.  Their judgment is  sharp and clear only as far as their own person does not come  into consideration.  It is the lack of any self criticism  combined with an abnormal egocentric trend of thought that biases  their judgments concerning themselves.  (f) Psychic traumata  arise perhaps through a striking reaction in the emotional realm  towards external occurrences.  (g) Nearly all of Risch's cases  were burdened with bad inheritance.  He maintains that, above  all, these cases show instability and psychic excitability.  The  entire symptom complex arises upon a basis of degeneracy.    Essential similarities run through all of Risch's cases; it is  perhaps valuable here to cite a couple of them.  His Case I is  that of a soldier, who after being released from prison at 23  years had begun his military duty and in a short time attempted  suicide.  He was then studied for insanity.  It was found that he  gave long accounts of his experiences as a chauffeur, rendering  his story with fluent details about hairbreadth escapes and other  adventures.  He also told at length of his love affair with a  young girl.  These stories were discovered to be false from ``A  to Z''; he did not clearly remember them later.  The evolving of  such fabrications was all along one of his chief characteristics.  Examination showed no gross intellectual defect, but there were  certain psychopathic signs which had been displayed from early  childhood: he had little endurance and was unable to stand  criticism.  Emotions befitting his stories were correctly  expressed by him; there were no facial evidences of conflict or  discomfort.  It was impossible to tell from his physiognomy that  he was engaged in untruths.  Mentally he was well oriented and  his thoughts flowed in orderly sequence.  Despite rather limited  education he demonstrated very good style in his conversation and  his letters.  The train of thought was expressed coherently and  logically, so well that one could speak of him as having literary  ability.  Physically he was quite normal.  Investigation of  antecedents showed that he was born of an exceedingly nervous  mother (more exact diagnosis not given) and that he had a  feebleminded brother.  During his school career he was considered  to have quite fair ability.  He learned no trade, and after  stopping school would leave a position upon the slightest  provocation.  Before he was 23 he had been legally punished many  times for stealing and had spent, all told, over three years in  prison.  Once before he had attempted suicide.  After the  thorough study of him at 23 he was placed in an asylum.  There he  was occupied at basket weaving and was chiefly notable for  keeping up the characteristics that were peculiar to him before.  He continually lied and, indeed, seemed to get his main pleasure  out of telling fabulous stories to the other patients.    Case IV was a man of 31 years, a decorative painter by trade, who  presented himself at the states attorney's office and stated that  in a fit of jealousy he had shot and killed a man.  Taking up the  case it was soon found that this was quite untrue and that the  man was a chronic liar.  He seemed much astonished when he was  told that the man he claimed to have killed was still alive.  Further study of this self-accuser showed that he had been  punished by the law every year since he was 16.  His offenses  consisted of embezzling, theft, forgery, and swindling.  In all  he had served about 6 1/2 years.  His lying was so much a part of  his mental life that he seemed to be unable to discriminate  between his real and his fancied crimes.  He not only invented  stories, but was much inclined to play some role created by his  fancy.  There seemed to be a method in his cheating and swindling  which added to his undoubted pleasure in lying.  His peculiar  career was much furthered by the possession of a fluent style and  a good memory through which his creations were built up in most  plausible fashion.  He proved to be willingly introspective and  stated that his inclination to lie was a puzzle to him, and that  while he was engaged in prevarications he believed in them.  He  always was the hero of his own stories.  He further declared that  inner unrest and love of wandering drove him forth even when he  was living under orderly conditions.  He considered that his  feeling of restlessness was a weighty motive in the deeds for  which he had been punished.  At one time this man had simulated  attacks of epilepsy and attempted in connection with these to  swindle physicians and others.  His schooling had been continued  to the gymnasium, ``untertertia,'' then he had taken up his  trade.  His intelligence and memory were considered excellent.  He had an insane brother.    Vogt[11] has made a thorough analysis of six cases of  pathological liars, ranging from the very stupid to the  intelligent.  I. A girl, who had done poorly in school was unable  to hold a place and became a thief.  Her mother was epileptic.  Examination showed intelligence not equal to that of eight years  with moral inferiority on account of this weakness.  II. A  feebleminded girl of vacillating, weak judgment.  Father insane.  Her lies were marked by their fantastic nature.  III. Lively,  fanciful, unstable, hysterical girl.  Poor record at school.  IV.  Hysterical liar with peculiarities united with splendid mental  ability.  V. Unusually intelligent, 15 years old, illegitimate  child; normal mother who later had five sound children; father  drunkard.  Her lies were neither of suggested nor dreamy type,  they were skillfully dramatized means to an end in her fight for  social position.  In the psychiatric examination she was found  mentally normal.  VI. Girl thoroughly intelligent, good at  figures and puzzles, with no signs of degeneracy.      [11] ``Jugendliche Lugnerinnen.''  Zeitschrift fur Erforschung d.  jugend.  Schwachsinns., Bd. 3. H. 5. 1910; p. 465.        Vogt characterized the pathological lie as active, more  elaborately constructed, more inclusive, and leaving the ground  of reality more readily than ordinary lies.  Such lies he does  not always find egocentric.  To the pathological liar his own  creation is reality, so he walks securely, is open and amiable.  All these cases are gifted with lively imaginations and inclined  to autosuggestion.  Vogt calls the pathological lie a wish  psychosis.  This statement opens the way to an interesting and  valuable interpretation of the psychological significance of this  phenomenon of the mental life.  He finds many more girls than  boys among his cases; boys lie from need of defense and  protection, girls more from autosuggestion.  This type of lie is  of greater interest to social than to clinical psychology.  He  emphasizes the point that very refined and complicated lies  appear in healthy young people in the stress of difficult  situations.  Obstinate and stubborn lying of itself is no disease  among children; examination must reveal that the lie has a morbid  cause.    The resemblance of pathological lying to poetic creation was  first suggested by Delbruck[12] in a reference to Keller's ``Der  grune Heinrich,'' a German novel in which the lies of a boy of  seven years, lies of a creative type of the nature of retroactive  hallucinations, are described.  Hinrichsen[13] discusses at  length the resemblance of pseudologia phantastica to poetic  creation in Goethe, Grillparzer, Hoffman, and others.      [12] loc. cit.    [13] ``Zur Kasuistik und Psychologie der Pseudologia  phantastica.'' Arch. fur Kriminal Anthrop. umd Kriminalistik,  1906.        In an inaugural dissertation Anna Stemmermann[14] presents  exhaustively a series of cases.  These cases were studied over a  long period catamnestically.  Commenting upon one case she says:  It is worthy of note in this history that the patient in a  hypnoidal condition, with headache and flushed face, crochets in  a senseless way and thinks she is weaving a wreath for her  mother's grave, her mother being still alive.  We often meet with  actions like this.  Characteristic is the report of spontaneous,  fearful headache, without the patient's putting this in relation  to her peculiar behavior.  We lay more stress upon this condition  than has been done previously in the literature.  We believe that  this symptom is wanting in no classic case of pseudologia  phantastica.  Often in this condition of narrowed consciousness,  the daydreams are spun and have such a power of convincing that  they later make the basis for pathological lies and swindling.  In this hypnoidal state a strongly heightened suggestibility  exists and trivial external causes give daydreams their  direction.  The general trend of fancy reveals naturally the  inclinations and ideals of the affected individual.  Stemmermann  also maintained that the pathological lie is a wish psychosis.  Even outside of the hypnoidal state, these cases are more  suggestible than the general run of people.      [14] ``Beitrage und Kasuistik der Pseudologia phantastica.'' Geo.  Reimer, Berlin, 1906, pp. 102.        Of Stemmermann's own cases, ten in number, only four at most were  normally endowed, the remainder were either stupid or slightly  imbecile.  This agrees with the experience of"]]]
