Our lake was therefore  \"discovered\" from the west--a fact perhaps without parallel in the  history of American exploration.    After the meeting with Joliet, La Salle left the missionaries, who,  taking advantage of information had from Joliet, followed the Grand  River down to Lake Erie. Subsequently they passed through Lake Erie to  the westward, the first of white men to explore the lake in that  direction. De Galinee's map (1669) is the first that gives us the north  shore of Lake Erie with approximate accuracy. On October 15th this  devout man and his companion reached Lake Erie, which they described as  \"a vast sea, tossed by tempestuous winds.\" Deterred by the lateness of  the season from attempting further travel by this course, they  determined to winter where they were, and built a cabin for their  shelter.    Occasionally they were visited in their hut by Iroquois beaver hunters.  For five months and eleven days they remained in their winter quarters  and on the 23d of March, 1670, being Passion Sunday, they erected a  cross as a memorial of their long sojourn. The official record of the  act is as follows:         \"We the undersigned certify that we have seen affixed on the lands       of the lake called Erie the arms of the King of France with this       inscription: 'The year of salvation 1669, Clement IX. being seated       in St. Peter's chair, Louis XIV. reigning in France, M. de       Courcelle being Governor of New France, and M. Talon being       intendant therein for the King, there arrived in this place two       missionaries from Montreal accompanied by seven other Frenchmen,       who, the first of all European peoples, have wintered on this lake,       of which, as of a territory not occupied, they have taken       possession in the name of their King by the apposition of his arms,       which they have attached to the foot of this cross. In witness       whereof we have signed the present certificate.'                                                      \"FRANCOIS DOLLIER,                          \"Priest of the Diocese of Nantes in Brittany.                                                    \"DE GALINEE,                          \"Deacon of the Diocese of Rennes in Brittany.\"    The winter was exceedingly mild, but the stream[5] was still frozen on  the 26th of March, when they portaged their canoes and goods to the lake  to resume their westward journey. Unfortunately losing one of their  canoes in a gale they were obliged to divide their party, four men with  the luggage going in the two remaining canoes; while the rest, including  the missionaries, undertook the wearisome journey on foot all the way  from Long Point to the mouth of the Kettle Creek. De Galinee grows  enthusiastic in his admiration for the immense quantities of game and  fruits opposite Long Point and calls the country the terrestrial  Paradise of Canada. \"The grapes were as large and as sweet as the finest  in France. The wine made from them was as good as _vin de Grave_.\" He  admires the profusion of walnuts, chestnuts, wild apples and plums.  Bears were fatter and better to the palate than the most \"savory\" pigs  in France. Deer wandered in herds of fifty to an hundred. Sometimes even  two hundred would be seen feeding together. Before arriving at the sand  beach which then connected Long Point with the mainland they had to  cross two streams. To cross the first stream they were forced to walk  four leagues inland before they found a satisfactory place to cross. One  whole day was spent in constructing a raft to cross Big Creek, and after  another delay caused by a severe snow-storm, they successfully effected  a crossing and found on the west side a marshy meadow two hundred paces  wide into which they sank to their girdles in mud and slush. Beset by  dangers and retarded by inclement weather, they at last arrived at  Kettle Creek, where they expected to find the canoe in which Joliet had  come down Lake Huron and the Detroit and which he had told them was  hidden there. Great was their disappointment to find that the Indians  had taken it. However, later in the day, while gathering some wood for a  fire, they found the canoe between two logs and joyfully bore it to the  lake. In the vicinity of their encampment the hunters failed to secure  any game, and for four or five days the party subsisted on boiled maize.  The whole party then paddled up the lake to a place where game was  plentiful and the hunters saw more than two hundred deer in one herd,  but missed their aim. Disheartened at their failure and craving meat,  they shot and skinned a miserable wolf and had it ready for the kettle  when one of the men saw some thirty deer on the other side of the small  lake they were on. The party succeeded in surrounding the deer and,  forcing them into the water, killed ten of them. Now well supplied with  both fresh and smoked meat, they continued their journey, traveled  nearly fifty miles in one day and came to a beautiful sand beach (Point  Pelee), where they drew up their canoes and camped for the night. During  the night a terrific gale came up from the northeast. Awakened by the  storm they made all shift to save their canoes and cargoes. Dollier's  and de Galinee's canoes were saved, but the other one was swept away  with its contents of provisions, goods for barter, ammunition, and,  worst of all, the altar service, with which they intended establishing  their mission among the Pottawatamies.    The loss of their altar service caused them to abandon the mission and  they set out to return to Montreal, but strangely enough chose the long,  roundabout journey by way of the Detroit, Lake Huron and the French  River, in preference to the route by which they had come, or by the  outlet of Lake Erie, which they had crossed the autumn before. Thus de  Galinee and Dollier de Casson, like Joliet,--not to revert to Champlain  half a century earlier,--missed the opportunity, which seemed to wait  for them, of exploring the eastern end of Lake Erie, of correctly  mapping the Niagara and observing and describing its incomparable  cataract. Obviously the Niagara region was shunned less on account of  its real difficulties, which were not then known, than through terror of  the Iroquois. Our two Sulpitians reached Montreal June 18, 1670, which  date marks the close of the third missionary visitation in the history  of the Niagara.           *       *       *       *       *    And now I approach the point at which many writers of our local history  have chosen to begin their story--the famous expedition of La Salle and  his companions in 1678-'79. For the purpose of the present study we may  omit the more familiar aspects of that adventure, and limit our regard  to the acts of the holy men who continue the interrupted chain of  missionary work on the Niagara. On December 6th, St. Nicholas Day, 1678,  with an advance party under La Motte de Lussiere, came the Flemish  Recollect, Louis Hennepin. As the bark in which they had crossed stormy  Lake Ontario at length entered the Niagara, they chanted the Ambrosian  hymn, \"Te Deum Laudamus,\" and there is no gainsaying the sincerity of  that thank-offering for perils escaped. Five days later, being encamped  on the present site of Niagara, Ont., Father Hennepin celebrated the  first mass ever said in the vicinity. A few days later, on the site of  Lewiston, he had completed a bark chapel, in which was held the first  Christian service which had been held on the eastern side of the Niagara  since the visit of Brebeuf thirty-eight years before. Father Hennepin  has left abundant chronicles of his activities on the Niagara. As soon  as the construction of the Griffon was begun above the falls a chapel  was established there, near the mouth of Cayuga Creek. Having blessed  this pioneer vessel of the upper lakes, when she was launched, he set  out for Fort Frontenac in the interests of the enterprise, and was  accompanied to the Niagara, on his return, by the Superior of the  mission, Father Gabriel de la Ribourde, and Fathers Zenobius Membre and  Melithon Watteaux. All through that summer these devoted priests shared  the varied labors of the camp. Hennepin tells us how he and his  companions toiled back and forth over the portage around the falls,  sometimes with their portable altar, sometimes with provisions, rigging  or other equipment for the ship. \"Father Gabriel,\" he says, \"though of  sixty-five years of age, bore with great vigor the fatigue of that  journey, and went thrice up and down those three mountains, which are  pretty high and steep.\" This glimpse of the saintly old priest is a  reminiscence to cherish in our local annals. He was the last of a noble  family in Burgundy who gave up worldly wealth and station to enter the  Order of St. Francis. He came to Canada in 1670, and was the first  Superior of the restored Recollect mission in that country. There is a  discrepancy between Hennepin and Le Clercq as to his age; the former  says he was sixty-five years old in 1679, when he was on the Niagara;  the later speaks of him as being in his seventieth year in 1680. Of the  three missionaries who with La Salle sailed up the Niagara in August,  1679, and with prayers and hymns boldly faced the dangers of the unknown  lake, the venerable Father Gabriel was first of all to receive the  martyr's crown. A year later, September 9, 1680, while engaged at his  devotions, he was basely murdered by three Indians. To Father Membre  there were allotted five years of missionary labor before he, too, was  to fall a victim to the savage. Father Hennepin lived many years, and  his chronicles stand to-day as in some respects the foundation of our  local history. But cherish as we may the memory of this trio of  missionaries, the imagination turns with a yet fonder regard back to the  devoted priest who was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37009"],[0,"Butterflies Worth Knowing (#5)"],[1,"in individual shelters the  Sovereigns, among which our common Viceroy is most familiar, are good  examples. Among those which hibernate in a tent woven by the whole  colony for the whole colony the Baltimore or Phaeton butterfly is  perhaps the best example.    The caterpillars that hibernate when full grown may be grouped in a  way somewhat similar to those which are half grown. Many species  simply find such shelter as they may at or near the soil surface. The  Clouded Sulphur is a good example of these. Others pass the winter in  individual shelters made from a leaf or blade. Several of the larger  Skippers are good examples of this condition. So far as I know none of  our species pass the winter in colonial shelters when full grown.    It would be natural to suppose that the great majority of butterflies  would be likely to hibernate in the chrysalis state. Here is a quiet  stage in which the insect is unable to move about or to take any food,  in which it seems entirely dormant and as a rule is fairly well hidden  from the view of enemies. We find, however, that only a rather small  proportion of our butterflies has chosen this stage for survival  through the winter. The most conspicuous examples are the  Swallowtails, nearly all of which hibernate in the chrysalis stage.  Other examples are the various Whites, the Orange-tips, and isolated  species like the Wanderer, and the Spring Azure and the American  Copper. Practically all the butterflies that pass the winter as  chrysalids have a silken loop running around near the middle of the  body which helps to hold them securely through the long winter months.  Apparently none of those chrysalids which hang straight downward are  able to survive the winter.    An adult butterfly seems a fragile creature to endure the long cold  months of arctic regions. Yet many of our most beautiful species  habitually hibernate as adults, finding shelter in such situations as  hollow trees, the crevices in rocks, the openings beneath loose bark  or even the outer bark on the under side of a large branch. It is  significant that most of the adult-wintering Angle-wings are northern  rather than southern species, some of them being found in arctic  regions practically around the world. One of the few southern forms  that hibernates as an adult is the Goatweed Emperor.    These examples are all cases of true hibernation in a lethargic  condition. There are certain butterflies, however, which pass the  winter as adults that remain active during this period. Obviously this  is impossible in latitudes where the winter is severe, and it involves  migration to a warmer climate. The one notable illustration of this is  the Monarch butterfly which apparently flies southward to the Gulf  states at least and there remains until spring, when individuals come  north again. The southward migration may be begun in Canada when the  butterflies gather together in enormous flocks that remind one of the  gathering of the clans with the migrating birds. This is one of the  least understood of insect activities but it has been observed so  often and over so long a period of years that there seems to be no  questioning the general habit.    Like everything else in relation to living things there are numerous  variations in the prevailing modes of hibernation. In the case of many  species one can find combinations of two or more stages in which the  winter is passed. Probably if we could observe with sufficient care we  might be able to find somewhere examples of almost any conceivable  double combination--as egg with larva or chrysalis or adult--the  insect hibernating in two of these stages. Many examples are known in  which both chrysalis and adult of the same species pass the winter and  also of those in which young and well-grown larvae pass the winter. As  one would expect, the conditions as to such combinations are likely to  be more variable in southern than in northern regions.    Notwithstanding all the attention which has been paid to butterfly  life-histories there is still some uncertainty in regard to the  hibernation of many of our species. One of the most interesting series  of observations which a young naturalist could undertake would be to  learn positively how each species of butterfly in his locality passes  the winter.          AESTIVATION OR SUMMER LETHARGY      In some species of butterflies there is a special adaptation to  passing through the hottest part of the summer season in a state of  lethargy which is suggestive of the torpor of the hibernating period.  This phase of butterfly existence has not been extensively studied and  there are indications that it exists more generally than has been  commonly supposed. It has been noticed even in northern New England  that some of the Angle-wings seek shelter and become lethargic during  August. Apparently this is an adaptation to single broodedness,  helping to carry the species through the year without the exhaustion  incident to the continued activity of the butterfly.    In more southern regions, especially in the hot, dry climates where  vegetation withers in midsummer, it is well known that some  caterpillars become lethargic, remaining inactive until the fall rains  start vegetation into growth. The Orange-sulphur butterfly is a good  example of this.    This summer lethargy offers excellent opportunity for careful study.  Any observer who finds a butterfly hidden away in summer under boards,  the bark of a tree, or in a stone pile should look carefully to see  what species it is and how the butterfly behaves. Such observations  should be sent to the entomological journals in order that our  knowledge of the subject may be increased.          FEIGNING DEATH      The fact has long been noticed that various butterflies have the habit  at times of feigning death and dropping to the ground where they may  lie motionless for a considerable period. This habit is most easily  observed in some of the Angle-wings, especially those which hibernate  as adults. Those species have the under surfaces of their wings  colored in various bark-picturing patterns and apparently live  through the winter to some extent, resting beneath the bark of large  branches or upon the trunks of trees. Many of them also secrete  themselves in hollow trees or beneath loose bark or in board piles or  stone walls. It is probable, however, that during the long ages when  these insects were adapting themselves to their life conditions,  before man interfered with the natural order and furnished various  more or less artificial places for hibernation, these butterflies  rested more generally upon the under side of branches than they do  now.    Even in warm weather when one of these butterflies is suddenly  disturbed it is likely to fold its legs upon its body and drop to the  ground, allowing itself to be handled without showing any signs of  life. This habit is doubtless of value, especially during hibernation  or possibly during the summer lethargy or aestivation, the latter a  habit which may be more general among these butterflies than is now  supposed. As the insect lies motionless upon the ground it is very  likely to blend so thoroughly with its surroundings that it becomes  concealed, and any bird which had startled it from the branch above  would have difficulty in finding it.    Some very interesting observations have been made upon the  death-feigning instincts of various other insects, especially the  beetles. But no one so far as I know has yet made an extended study of  the subject in relation to our American butterflies. It is an  excellent field for investigation and offers unusual opportunities for  photographic records. One of the pictures opposite page 32 shows a  photograph which I took of a Mourning Cloak as it was thus playing  'possum. This species exhibits the instinct to a marked degree.          COLORATION      The caterpillars of butterflies and moths form a large part of the  food of insect-eating birds. These caterpillars are especially adapted  for such a purpose and in the economy of nature they play a very  important part in keeping alive the feathered tribes. During the long  ages through which both birds and insects have been developing side by  side, there have been many remarkable inter-relations established  which tend on the one hand to prevent the birds from exterminating the  insects and on the other to prevent the insects from causing the birds  to starve. The most important of these, so far as the caterpillars are  concerned, are the various devices by which these insects protect  themselves from attack, by hiding away where birds are not likely to  find them, by clothing their bodies with spiny hairs, by other methods  of rendering themselves distasteful, or by various phases of  concealing coloration. On the whole, the examples of the latter are  not so numerous or so easily found in the case of the larvae of  butterflies as in those of moths.    Perhaps the basal principle of concealing coloration is the law of  counter-shading, first partially announced by Prof. E. B. Poulton, and  later much more elaborately worked out by Mr. Abbott H. Thayer, and  discussed at length by Mr. Gerald H. Thayer in his remarkable volume,  \"Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.\" The law of  counter-shading is tersely stated in these words: \"Animals are painted  by nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the  sky's light and _vice versa_.\" As this law works out on most animals  that live on or near the ground, the upper part of the body exposed  to the direct light from above is dark; and the under part, shut off  from the upper light and receiving only the small reflection from  below, is enough lighter to make the appearance of the creature in its  natural environment of a uniform tone from back to breast.    Nearly all caterpillars illustrate this law of counter-shading. If  they are in "]]]
