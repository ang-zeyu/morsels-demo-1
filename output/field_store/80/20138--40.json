The disordered troops  will rally in your rear.\" Like a rock, Desaix, with his solid  phalanx of ten thousand men, met the on-rolling billow of Austrian  victory. At the same time Napoleon dispatched an order to Kellerman,  with his cavalry, to charge the triumphant column of the Austrians  in flank. It was the work of a moment, and the whole aspect of the  field was changed. Napoleon rode along the lines of those on the  retreat, exclaiming, \"My friends, we have retreated far enough.  It is now our turn to advance. Recollect that I am in the habit  of sleeping on the field of battle.\" The fugitives, reanimated by  the arrival of the reserve, immediately rallied in their rear. The  double charge in front and flank was instantly made. The Austrians  were checked and staggered. A perfect tornado of bullets from Desaix's  division swept their ranks. They poured an answering volley into  the bosoms of the French. A bullet pierced the breast of Desaix,  and he fell and almost immediately expired. His last words were,  \"Tell the First Consul that my only regret in dying is, to have  perished before having done enough to live in the recollection of  posterity.\" The soldiers, who devotedly loved him, saw his fall,  and rushed more madly on to avenge his death. The swollen tide of  uproar, confusion, and dismay now turned, and rolled in surging  billows in the opposite direction. Hardly one moment elapsed before  the Austrians, flushed with victory, found themselves overwhelmed  by defeat. In the midst of this terrific scene, an aid rode up to  Napoleon and said, \"Desaix is dead.\" But a moment before they were  conversing side by side. Napoleon pressed his forehead convulsively  with his hand, and exclaimed, mournfully, \"Why is it not permitted  me to weep! Victory at such a price is dear.\"    The French now made the welkin ring with shouts of victory.  Indescribable dismay filled the Austrian ranks as wildly they  rushed before their unrelenting pursuers. Their rout was utter and  hopeless. When the sun went down over this field of blood, after  twelve hours of the most frightful carnage, a scene was presented  horrid enough to appall the heart of a demon. More than twenty thousand  human bodies were strewn upon the ground, the dying and the dead,  weltering in gore, and in every conceivable form of disfiguration.  Horses, with limbs torn their bodies, were struggling in convulsive  agonies. Fragments of guns and swords, and of military wagons  of every kind were strewed around in wild ruin. Frequent piercing  cries, which agony extorted from the lacerated victims of war,  rose above the general moanings of anguish, which, like wailings  of the storm, fell heavily upon the ear. The shades of night were  now descending upon this awful scene of misery. The multitude of  the wounded was so great, that notwithstanding the utmost exertions  of the surgeons, hour after hour of the long night lingered away,  while thousands of the wounded and the dying bit the dust in their  agony.    If war has its chivalry and its pageantry, it has also revolting  hideousness and demoniac woe. The young, the noble, the sanguine  were writhing there in agony. Bullets respect not beauty. They tear  out the eye, and shatter the jaw, and rend the cheek, and transform  the human face divine into an aspect upon which one can not gaze  but with horror. From the field of Marengo many a young man returned  to his home so multilated as no longer to be recognized by friends,  and passed a weary life in repulsive deformity. Mercy abandons the  arena of battle. The frantic war-horse with iron hoof tramples upon  the mangled face, the throbbing and inflamed wounds the splintered  bones, and heeds not the shriek of torture. Crushed into the bloody  mire by the ponderous wheels of heavy artillery, the victim of  barbaric war thinks of mother, and father, and sister, and home,  and shrieks, and moans, and dies; his body is stripped by the  vagabonds who follow the camp; his naked mangled corpse is covered  with a few shovels-full of earth, and left as food for vultures and  for dogs and he is forgotten forever--and it is called glory . He  who loves war, for the sake of its excitements, its pageantry, and  its fancied glory, is the most eminent of all the dupes of folly  and of sin. He who loathes war, with inexpressible loathing, who  will do everything in his power to avert the dire and horrible  calamity, but who will, nevertheless, in the last extremity, with  a determined spirit, encounter all its perils, from love of country  and of home, who is willing to sacrifice himself and all that is  dear to him in life, to promote the well being of his fellow-man,  will ever receive the homage of the world, and we also fully believe  that he will receive the approval of God. Washington abhorred war  in all its forms, yet he braved all its perils.    For the carnage of the field of Marengo, Napoleon can not be held  responsible. Upon England and Austria must rest all the guilt of  that awful tragedy. Napoleon had done every thing he could do to  stop the effusion of blood. He had sacrificed the instincts of pride,  in pleading with a haughty foe for peace. His plea was unavailing.  Three hundred thousand men were marching upon France to force upon  her a detested King. It was not the duty of France to submit to  such dictation. Drawing the sword in self-defense, Napoleon fought  and conquered. \"Te Deum Laudamus.\"    It is not possible but that Napoleon must have been elated by so  resplendent a victory. He knew that Marengo would be classed as the  most brilliant of his achievements. The blow had fallen with such  terrible severity that the haughty allies were thoroughly humbled.  Melas was now at his mercy. Napoleon could dictate peace upon his  own terms. Yet he rode over the field of his victory with a saddened  spirit, and gazed mournfully upon the ruin and the wretchedness  around him. As he was slowly and thoughtfully passing along, through  the heaps of the dead with which the ground was encumbered, he met  a number of carts, heavily laden with the wounded, torn by balls,  and bullets, and fragments of shells, into most hideous spectacles  of deformity. As the heavy wheels lumbered over the rough ground,  grating the splintered bones, and bruising and opening afresh  the inflamed wounds, shrieks of torture were extorted from the  victims. Napoleon stopped his horse and uncovered his head, as the  melancholy procession of misfortune and woe passed along. Turning  to a companion, he said, \"We can not but regret not being wounded  like these unhappy men, that we might share their sufferings.\"  A more touching expression of sympathy never has been recorded.  He who says that this was hypocrisy is a stranger to the generous  impulses of a noble heart. This instinctive outburst of emotion  never could have been instigated by policy.    Napoleon had fearlessly exposed himself to every peril during this  conflict. His clothes were repeatedly pierced by bullets. Balls  struck between the legs of his horse, covering him with earth. A  cannon-ball took away a piece of the boot from his left leg and a  portion of the skin, leaving a scar which was never obliterated.    Before Napoleon Marched for Italy, he had made every effort in his  power for the attainment of peace. Now, with magnanimity above all  praise, without waiting for the first advance from his conquered  foes, he wrote again imploring peace. Upon the field of Marengo,  having scattered all his enemies like chaff before him, with the  smoke of the conflict still darkening the air, and the groans of  the dying swelling upon his ears, laying aside all the formalities  of state, with heartfelt feeling and earnestness he wrote to the  Emperor of Austria. This extraordinary epistle was thus commenced:    \"Sire! It is on the field of battle, amid the sufferings of a  multitude of wounded, and surrounded by fifteen thousand corpses,  that I beseech your majesty to listen to the voice of humanity,  and not to suffer two brave nations to cut each others' throats  for interests not their own. It is my part to press this upon your  majesty, being upon the very theatre of war. Your majesty's heart  can not feel it so keenly as does mine.\"    The letter was long and most eloquent. \"For what are you fighting?\"  said Napoleon. \"For religion? Then make war on the Russians and the  English who are the enemies of your faith. Do you wish to guard  against revolutionary principles? It is this very war which has  extended them over half the Continent, by extending the conquests  of France. The continuance of the war can not fail to diffuse them  still further. Is it for the balance of Europe? The English threaten  that balance far more than does France, for they have become the  masters and the tyrants of commerce, and are beyond the reach of  resistance. Is it to secure the interests of the house of Austria!  Let us then execute the treaty of Campo Formio, which secures to  your majesty large indemnities in compensation for the provinces  lost in the Netherlands, and secures them to you where you most  wish to obtain them, that is, in Italy. Your majesty may send  negotiators whither you will, and we will add to the treaty of  Campo Formio stipulations calculated to assure you of the continued  existence of the secondary states, of all which the French Republic  is accused of having shaken. Upon these conditions pace is made,  if you will. Let us make the armistice general for all the armies,  and enter into negotiations instantly.\"    A courier was immediately dispatched to Vienna, to convey this letter  to the Emperor. In the evening, Bourrienne hastened to congratulate  Napoleon upon his extraordinary victory. \"What a glorious  day!\" said Bourrienne. \"Yes!\" replied Napoleon, mournfully; \"very  glorious--could I this evening but have embraced Desaix upon the  field of battle.\"    On the same day, and at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#5)"],[1,"that the  man, while aged, was rugged and hearty, and his skin was tanned a  leathery brown, showing that he was much in the open air.    \"I'm a hunter,\" was the reply, \"a hunter of big game, principally  elephants, hippos and rhinoceroses. I've just finished a season in  Africa, and I'm going back there again soon. I came on to New York  to get a new elephant gun. I've got a sister living over in  Waterford, and I've been visiting her. I went out for a stroll  to-day, and I came farther than I intended. That's how I happened to be  passing here.\"    \"A sister in Waterford, eh?\" mused Tom, wondering whether the  elephant hunter had met Mr. Damon. \"And how soon are you going hack  to Africa, Mr.--er--\" and Tom hesitated.    \"Durban is my name, Alexander Durban,\" said the old man. \"Why, I am  to start back in a few weeks. I've got an order for a pair of big  elephant tusks--the largest I can get for a wealthy New York man,--and  I'm anxious to fulfil the contract. The game isn't what it once  was. There's more competition and the elephants are scarcer. So I've  got to hustle.\"    \"I got me a new gun. But my! it's nothing to what yours is. With  that weapon I could do about as I pleased. I could do night hunting,  which is hard in the African jungle. Then I wouldn't have any  trouble getting the big tusks I'm after. I could get a pair of them,  and live easy the rest of my life. Yes, I wouldn't ask anything  better than a gun like yours. But I s'pose they cost like the  mischief?\" He looked a question at Tom.    \"This is the only one there is,\" was the lad's answer. \"But I am  very glad to have met you, Mr. Durban. Won't you come into the  house? I'm sure my father will be glad to see you, and I have  something I'd like to talk to you about,\" and Tom, with many wild  ideas in his head, led the old elephant hunter toward the house.    The dream of the young inventor might come true after all.          CHAPTER V    RUSH WORK      Mr. Swift made the African hunter warmly welcome, and listened with  pride to the words of praise Mr. Durban bestowed on Tom regarding  the rifle.    \"Yes, my boy has certainly done wonders along the inventive line,\"  said Mr. Swift.    \"Not half as much as you have, Dad,\" interrupted the lad, for Tom  was a modest youth.    \"You should see his sky racer,\" went on the old inventor.    \"Sky racer? What's that?\" asked Mr. Durban. \"Is it another kind of  gun or cannon?\"    \"It's an aeroplane--an airship,\" explained Mr. Swift.    \"An airship!\" exclaimed the old elephant hunter. \"Say, you don't  mean that you make balloons, do you?\"    \"Well, they're not exactly balloons,\" replied Tom, as he briefly  explained what an aeroplane was, for Mr. Durban, having been in the  wilds of the jungle so much, had had very little chance to see the  wonders and progress of civilization.    \"They are better than balloons,\" went on Tom, \"for they can go where  you want them to.\"    \"Say! That's the very thing!\" cried the old hunter enthusiastically.  \"If there's one thing more than another that is needed in hunting in  Africa it's an airship. The travel through the jungle is something  fierce, and that, more than anything else, interferes with my work.  I can't cover ground enough, and when I do get on the track of a  herd of elephants, and they get away, it's sometimes a week before I  can catch up to them again.\"    \"For, in spite of their size, elephants can travel very fast, and  once they get on the go, nothing can stop them. An airship would be  the very thing to hunt elephants with in Africa--an airship and this  electric rifle. I wonder why you haven't thought of going, Tom  Swift.\"    \"I have thought of it,\" answered the young inventor, \"and that's why  I asked you in. I want to talk about it.\"    \"Do you mean you want to go?\" demanded the old man eagerly.    \"I certainly do!\"    \"Then I'm your man! Say, Tom Swift, I'd be proud to have you go to  Africa with me. I'd be proud to have you a member of my hunting  party, and, though I don't like to boast, still if you'll ask any of  the big-game people they'll tell you that not every one can  accompany Aleck Durban.\"    Tom realized that he was speaking to an authority and a most  desirable companion, should he go to Africa, and he was very glad of  the chance that had made him acquainted with the veteran hunter.    \"Will you go with me?\" asked Mr. Durban. \"You and your electric gun  and your airship? Will you come to Africa to hunt elephants, and  help me get the big tusks I'm after?\"    \"I will!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"Then we'll start at once. There's no need of delaying here any  longer.\"    \"Oh, but I haven't an airship ready,\" said the young inventor. The  face of the old hunter expressed his disappointment.    \"Then we'll have to give up the scheme,\" he said ruefully.    \"Not at all,\" Tom told him. \"I have all the material on hand for  building a new airship. I have had it in mind for some time, and I  have done some work on it. I stopped it to perfect my electric  rifle, but, now that is done, I'll tackle the Black Hawk again, and  rush that to completion.\"    \"The Black Hawk?\" repeated Mr. Durban, wonderingly.    \"Yes, that's what I will name my new craft. The RED CLOUD was  destroyed, and so I thought I'd change the color this time, and  avoid bad luck.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed the hunter. \"When do you think you can have it  finished?\"    \"Oh, possibly in a month--perhaps sooner, and then we will go to  Africa and hunt elephants!\"    \"Bless my ivory paper cutter!\" exclaimed a voice in the hall just  outside the library. \"Bless my fingernails! But who's talking about  going to Africa?\"    The old hunter looked at Tom and his father in surprise, but the  young inventor laughing and going to the door, called out:    \"Come on in, Mr. Damon. I didn't hear you ring. There is some one  here from your town.\"    \"Is it my wife?\" asked the odd gentleman who was always blessing  something. \"She said she was going to her mother's to spend a few  weeks, and so I thought I'd come over here and see if you had  anything new on the program. The first thing I hear is that you are  going to Africa. And so there's some one from Waterford in there,  eh? Is it my wife?\"    \"No,\" answered Tom with another laugh. \"Come on in Mr. Damon.\"    \"Bless my toothpick!\" exclaimed the odd gentleman, as he saw the  grizzled elephant hunter sitting between Tom and Mr. Swift. \"I have  seen you somewhere before, my dear sir.\"    \"Yes,\" admitted Mr. Durban, \"if you're from Waterford you have  probably seen me traveling about the streets there. I'm stopping  with my sister, Mrs. Douglass, but I can't stand it to be in the  house much, so I'm out of doors, wandering about a good bit of the  time. I miss my jungle. But we'll soon be in Africa, Tom Swift and  me.\"    \"Is it possible, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Bless my diamond mines! but  what are you going to do next?\"    \"It's hard to say,\" was the answer. \"But you came just in time. Mr.  Damon. I'm going to rush work on the Black Hawk, my newest airship,  and we'll leave for elephant land inside of a month, taking my new  electric rifle along. Will you come?\"    \"Bless my penknife! I never thought of such a thing. I--I--guess--no,  I don't know about it--yes, I'll go!\" he suddenly exclaimed.  \"I'll go! Hurrah for the elephants!\" and he jumped up and shook  hands in turn with Mr. Durban, to whom he had been formally  introduced, and with Tom and Mr. Swift.    \"Then it's all settled but the details,\" declared the youth, \"and  now I'll call in Mr. Jackson, and we'll talk about how soon we can  have the airship ready.\"    \"My, but you folks are almost as speedy as a herd of the big  elephants themselves!\" exclaimed Mr. Durban, and with the advent of  the engineer the talk turned to things mechanical among Tom and Mr.  Jackson and Mr. Damon, while Mr. Durban told Mr. Swift hunting  stories which the old inventor greatly enjoyed.    The next day Tom engaged two machinists who had worked for him  building airships before, and in the next week rush work began on  the new Black Hawk. Meanwhile Mr. Durban was a frequent visitor at  Tom's home, where he learned to use the new rifle, declaring it was  even more wonderful than he had at first supposed.    \"That will get the elephants!\" he exclaimed. It did, as you shall  soon learn, and it also was the means of saving several lives in the  wilds of the African jungle.          CHAPTER VI    NEWS FROM ANDY      Tom Swift's former airship, the Red Cloud, had been such a fine  craft, and had done such good service that he thought, in building a  successor, that he could do no better than to follow the design of  the skyship which had been destroyed in the ice caves. But, on  talking with the old elephant hunter, and learning something of the  peculiarities of the African jungle the young inventor decided on  certain changes.    In general the Black Hawk would be on the lines of the Red Cloud but  it would be smaller and lighter and would also be capable of swifter  motion.    \"You want it so that it will rise and descend quickly and at sharp  angles,\" said Mr. Durban.    \"Why,\" inquired Tom.    \"Because in Africa, at least in the part where we will go, there are  wide patches of jungle and forest, with here and there big open  places. If you are skimming along close to the ground, in an open  place, in pursuit of a herd of elephants and they should suddenly  plunge into the forest, you would want to be able to rise above the  trees quickly.\"    \"That's so,\" admitted Tom. \"Then I'll have to use a smaller gas bag  than we had on the other ship, for the air resistance to that big  one made us go slowly at times.\"    \"Will it be as safe with a small bag?\" Mr. Damon wanted to know.    \"Yes, for I will use a more powerful gas, so that we will be more  quickly lifted,\" said the young inventor. \"I will also retain the  aeroplane feature, so that the Black Hawk will be a combined biplane  and dirigible balloon.
