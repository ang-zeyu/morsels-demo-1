And she,  not paralyzed by a preliminary vivisection, endowed with all her normal  vitality, lets him have his way, lets herself be sucked dry, with the  utmost apathy. Not a tremor in her outraged flesh, not a quiver of  resistance. No corpse could show greater indifference to the bite which  it receives.    Ah, but the maggot has chosen the hour of attack with traitorous  cunning! Had it appeared upon the scene earlier, when the larva was  consuming its store of honey, things of a surety would have gone badly  with it. The assaulted one, feeling herself bled to death by that  ravenous kiss, would have protested with much wriggling of body and  grinding of mandibles. The position would have ceased to be tenable  and the intruder would have perished. But at this hour all danger has  disappeared. Enclosed in its silken tent, the larva is seized with the  lethargy that precedes the metamorphosis. Its condition is not death,  but neither is it life. It is an intermediary condition; it is almost  the latent vitality of grain or egg. Therefore there is no sign of  irritation on the larva's part under the needle with which I stir it and  still less under the sucker of the Anthrax grub, which is able to drain  the affluent breast in perfect safety.    This lack of resistance, induced by the torpor of the transformation,  appears to me necessary, in view of the weakness of the nursling as it  leaves the egg, whenever the mother is herself incapable of depriving  the victim of the power of self defense. And so the nonparalyzed larvae  are attacked during the period of the nymphosis. We shall soon see other  instances of this.    Motionless though it be, the Chalicodoma grub is none the less alive.  The primrose tint and the glossy skin are unequivocal signs of health:  Were it really dead, it would, in less than twenty-four hours, turn a  dirty brown and, soon after, decompose into a fluid putrescence. Now  here is the marvelous thing: during the fortnight, roughly, that the  Anthrax' meal lasts, the butter color of the larva, an unfailing symptom  of the presence of life, continues unaltered and does not change into  brown, the sign of putrefaction, until hardly anything remains; and even  then the brown hue is often absent. As a rule, the look of live flesh is  preserved until the final pellet, formed of the skin, the sole residue,  makes its appearance. This pellet is white, with not a speck of tainted  matter, proving that life persists until the body is reduced to nothing.    We here witness the transfusion of one animal into another, the change  of Chalicodoma substance into Anthrax substance; and, as long as the  transfusion is not complete, as long as the eaten has not disappeared  altogether and become the eater, the ruined organism fights against  destruction. What manner of life is this, which may be compared with  the life of a night light whose extinction is not accomplished until  the last drop of oil has burnt away? How is any creature able to fight  against the final tragedy of corruption up to the last moment in which a  nucleus of matter remains as the seat of vital energy? The forces of the  living creature are here dissipated not through any disturbance of  the equilibrium of those forces, but for the want of any point of  application for them: the larva dies because materially there is no more  of it.    Can we be in the presence of the diffusive life of the plant, a life  which persists in a fragment? By no means: the grub is a more delicate  organic structure. There is unity between the several parts; and none of  them can be jeopardized without involving the ruin of the others. If I  myself give the larva a wound, if I bruise it, the whole body very soon  turns brown and begins to rot. It dies and decomposes by the mere prick  of a needle; it keeps alive, or at least preserves the freshness of  the live tissues, so long as it is not entirely emptied by the Anthrax'  sucker. A nothing kills it; an atrocious wasting does not. No, I fail to  understand the problem; and I bequeath it to others.    All that I can see by way of a glimpse--and even then I put forward my  suspicions with extreme reserve--all that I am permitted to surmise is  reduced to this: the substance of the sleeping larva as yet has no very  definite static existence; it is like the raw materials collected for a  building; it is waiting for the elaboration that is to make a bee of it.  To mould those shapeless lumps of the future insect, the air, that prime  adjuster of living things, circulates among them, passing through a  network of ducts. To organize them, to direct the placing of them, the  nervous system, the embryo of the animal, distributes its ramifications  over them. Nerve and air duct, therefore, are the essentials; the rest  is so much material in reserve for the process of the metamorphosis. As  long as that material is not employed, as long as it has not acquired  its final equilibrium, it can grow less and less; and life, though  languishing, will continue all the same on the express condition that  the respiratory organs and the nervous filaments be respected. It is as  it were the flame of the lamp, which, whether full or empty, continues  to give light so long as the wick is soaked in oil. Nothing but fluids,  the plastic materials held in reserve, can be distilled by the  Anthrax' sucker through the unpierced skin of the grub; no part of the  respiratory and nervous systems passes. As the two essential functions  remain unscathed, life goes on until exhaustion is completed. On the  other hand, if I myself injure the larva, I disturb the nervous or air  conducting filaments; and the bruised part spreads a taint, followed by  putrefaction, all over the body.    I have elsewhere, speaking of the Scolia [a digger wasp] devouring the  Cetonia grub, enlarged upon this refined art of eating which consists  in consuming the prey while killing it only at the last mouthfuls. The  Anthrax has the same requirements as his competitors who dine off fresh  viands. He needs meat of that day, taken from a single joint that has to  last a fortnight without going bad. His method of consuming reaches the  highest level of art: he does not cut into his prey, he sips it little  by little through his sucker. In this way, any dangerous risk is  averted. Whether he imbibe at this spot or at that, even if he abandon  the sucking process and resume it later, by no accident can he ever  attack that which it is incumbent upon him to respect lest corruption  supervene. The others have a fixed position on the victim, a place at  which their mandibles have to bite and enter. If they move away from  it, if they miss the appointed path, they imperil their existence. The  Anthrax, more highly favored, puts his mouth where it suits him; he  leaves off when he pleases and when he pleases starts again.    Unless I labor under a delusion, I think that I see the necessity for  this privilege. The egg of the carnivorous burrower is firmly fixed on  the victim at a point which varies considerably, it is true, according  to the nature of the prey, but which is uniform for the same species  of prey; moreover--and this is an important condition--the point of  adhesion of that egg is always the head, whereas the egg of a bee, of  the Osmia, for instance, is fixed to the mess of honey by the hinder  end. When hatched, the new born Wasp grub has not to choose for itself,  at its risk and peril, the suitable point at which to take the first cut  in the quarry without fear of killing it too quickly: all that it need  do is to bite at the spot where it has just been born. The mother, with  her unfailing instinct, has already made the dangerous choice; she has  stuck her egg on the propitious spot and, by the very act of doing so,  marked out the course for the inexperienced grub to follow. The tact of  ripe age here guides the young larva's behavior at table.    The conditions are very different in the Anthrax' case. The egg is not  placed upon the victuals, it is not even laid in the mason bee's cell.  This is the natural consequence of the mother's feeble frame and of her  lack of any instrument, such as a probe or auger, capable of piercing  the mortar wall. It is for the newly hatched grub to make its own way  into the dwelling. It enters, finds itself in the presence of ample  provisions, the larva of the mason bee. Free of its actions, it is at  liberty to attack the prey where it chooses; or rather the attacking  point will be decided at haphazard by the first contact of the mouth  in quest of food. Grant this mouth a set of carving tools, jaws and  mandibles; in short, suppose the grub of the Fly to possess a manner of  eating similar to that of the other carnivorous larvae; and the nursling  is at once threatened with a speedy death. He will split open his  nurse's belly, he will dig without any rule to guide him, he will bite  at random, essentials as well as accessories; and, from one day to the  next, he will set up gangrene in the violated mass, even as I myself do  when I give it a wound. For the lack of an attacking point prescribed  for him at birth, he will perish on the damaged provisions. His freedom  of action will have killed him.    Certainly, liberty is a noble attribute, even in an insignificant grub;  but it also has its dangers everywhere. The Anthrax escapes the peril  only on the condition of being, so to speak, muzzled. His mouth is not a  fierce forceps that tears asunder; it is a sucker that exhausts but does  not wound. Thus restrained by this safety appliance, which changes the  bite into a kiss, the grub has fresh victuals until it has finished  growing, although it knows nothing of the rules of methodical  consumption at a fixed point and in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#5)"],[1,"all about the sky, had overflowed around it, and rendered a clear view  almost impossible.    \"I can't quite make it out,\" says Frere, handing back the telescope. \"We  can see as soon as the sun goes down a little.\"    Then Mrs. Vickers must, of course, look also, and was prettily affected  about the focus of the glass, applying herself to that instrument with  much girlish giggling, and finally declaring, after shutting one eye  with her fair hand, that positively she \"could see nothing but sky, and  believed that wicked Mr. Frere was doing it on purpose.\"    By and by, Captain Blunt appeared, and, taking the glass from his  officer, looked through it long and carefully. Then the mizentop was  appealed to, and declared that he could see nothing; and at last the sun  went down with a jerk, as though it had slipped through a slit in the  sea, and the black spot, swallowed up in the gathering haze, was seen no  more.    As the sun sank, the relief guard came up the after hatchway, and the  relieved guard prepared to superintend the descent of the convicts. At  this moment Sylvia missed her ball, which, taking advantage of a sudden  lurch of the vessel, hopped over the barricade, and rolled to the feet  of Rufus Dawes, who was still leaning, apparently lost in thought,  against the side.    The bright spot of colour rolling across the white deck caught his eye;  stooping mechanically, he picked up the ball, and stepped forward to  return it. The door of the barricade was open and the sentry--a young  soldier, occupied in staring at the relief guard--did not notice the  prisoner pass through it. In another instant he was on the sacred  quarter-deck.    Heated with the game, her cheeks aglow, her eyes sparkling, her golden  hair afloat, Sylvia had turned to leap after her plaything, but even as  she turned, from under the shadow of the cuddy glided a rounded white  arm; and a shapely hand caught the child by the sash and drew her back.  The next moment the young man in grey had placed the toy in her hand.    Maurice Frere, descending the poop ladder, had not witnessed this little  incident; on reaching the deck, he saw only the unexplained presence of  the convict uniform.    \"Thank you,\" said a voice, as Rufus Dawes stooped before the pouting  Sylvia.    The convict raised his eyes and saw a young girl of eighteen or nineteen  years of age, tall, and well developed, who, dressed in a loose-sleeved  robe of some white material, was standing in the doorway. She had black  hair, coiled around a narrow and flat head, a small foot, white skin,  well-shaped hands, and large dark eyes, and as she smiled at him, her  scarlet lips showed her white even teeth.    He knew her at once. She was Sarah Purfoy, Mrs. Vickers's maid, but he  never had been so close to her before; and it seemed to him that he was  in the presence of some strange tropical flower, which exhaled a heavy  and intoxicating perfume.    For an instant the two looked at each other, and then Rufus Dawes was  seized from behind by his collar, and flung with a shock upon the deck.    Leaping to his feet, his first impulse was to rush upon his assailant,  but he saw the ready bayonet of the sentry gleam, and he checked himself  with an effort, for his assailant was Mr. Maurice Frere.    \"What the devil do you do here?\" asked the gentleman with an oath. \"You  lazy, skulking hound, what brings you here? If I catch you putting your  foot on the quarter-deck again, I'll give you a week in irons!\"    Rufus Dawes, pale with rage and mortification, opened his mouth to  justify himself, but he allowed the words to die on his lips. What was  the use? \"Go down below, and remember what I've told you,\" cried Frere;  and comprehending at once what had occurred, he made a mental minute of  the name of the defaulting sentry.    The convict, wiping the blood from his face, turned on his heel without  a word, and went back through the strong oak door into his den. Frere  leant forward and took the girl's shapely hand with an easy gesture, but  she drew it away, with a flash of her black eyes.    \"You coward!\" she said.    The stolid soldier close beside them heard it, and his eye twinkled.  Frere bit his thick lips with mortification, as he followed the girl  into the cuddy. Sarah Purfoy, however, taking the astonished Sylvia by  the hand, glided into her mistress's cabin with a scornful laugh, and  shut the door behind her.          CHAPTER II. SARAH PURFOY.        Convictism having been safely got under hatches, and put to bed in its  Government allowance of sixteen inches of space per man, cut a little  short by exigencies of shipboard, the cuddy was wont to pass some not  unpleasant evenings. Mrs. Vickers, who was poetical and owned a guitar,  was also musical and sang to it. Captain Blunt was a jovial, coarse  fellow; Surgeon Pine had a mania for story-telling; while if Vickers was  sometimes dull, Frere was always hearty. Moreover, the table was well  served, and what with dinner, tobacco, whist, music, and brandy and  water, the sultry evenings passed away with a rapidity of which the  wild beasts 'tween decks, cooped by sixes in berths of a mere five feet  square, had no conception.    On this particular evening, however, the cuddy was dull. Dinner fell  flat, and conversation languished.    \"No signs of a breeze, Mr. Best?\" asked Blunt, as the first officer came  in and took his seat.    \"None, sir.\"    \"These--he, he!--awful calms,\" says Mrs. Vickers. \"A week, is it not,  Captain Blunt?\"    \"Thirteen days, mum,\" growled Blunt.    \"I remember, off the Coromandel coast,\" put in cheerful Pine, \"when we  had the plague in the Rattlesnake--\"    \"Captain Vickers, another glass of wine?\" cried Blunt, hastening to cut  the anecdote short.    \"Thank you, no more. I have the headache.\"    \"Headache--um--don't wonder at it, going down among those fellows. It is  infamous the way they crowd these ships. Here we have over two hundred  souls on board, and not boat room for half of 'em.\"    \"Two hundred souls! Surely not,\" says Vickers. \"By the King's  Regulations--\"    \"One hundred and eighty convicts, fifty soldiers, thirty in ship's crew,  all told, and--how many?--one, two three--seven in the cuddy. How many  do you make that?\"    \"We are just a little crowded this time,\" says Best.    \"It is very wrong,\" says Vickers, pompously. \"Very wrong. By the King's  Regulations--\"    But the subject of the King's Regulations was even more distasteful to  the cuddy than Pine's interminable anecdotes, and Mrs. Vickers hastened  to change the subject.    \"Are you not heartily tired of this dreadful life, Mr. Frere?\"    \"Well, it is not exactly the life I had hoped to lead,\" said Frere,  rubbing a freckled hand over his stubborn red hair; \"but I must make the  best of it.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said the lady, in that subdued manner with which one  comments upon a well-known accident, \"it must have been a great shock to  you to be so suddenly deprived of so large a fortune.\"    \"Not only that, but to find that the black sheep who got it all sailed  for India within a week of my uncle's death! Lady Devine got a letter  from him on the day of the funeral to say that he had taken his passage  in the Hydaspes for Calcutta, and never meant to come back again!\"    \"Sir Richard Devine left no other children?\"    \"No, only this mysterious Dick, whom I never saw, but who must have  hated me.\"    \"Dear, dear! These family quarrels are dreadful things. Poor Lady  Devine, to lose in one day a husband and a son!\"    \"And the next morning to hear of the murder of her cousin! You know that  we are connected with the Bellasis family. My aunt's father married a  sister of the second Lord Bellasis.\"    \"Indeed. That was a horrible murder. So you think that the dreadful man  you pointed out the other day did it?\"    \"The jury seemed to think not,\" said Mr. Frere, with a laugh; \"but I  don't know anybody else who could have a motive for it. However, I'll go  on deck and have a smoke.\"    \"I wonder what induced that old hunks of a shipbuilder to try to cut  off his only son in favour of a cub of that sort,\" said Surgeon Pine to  Captain Vickers as the broad back of Mr. Maurice Frere disappeared up  the companion.    \"Some boyish follies abroad, I believe; self-made men are always  impatient of extravagance. But it is hard upon Frere. He is not a bad  sort of fellow for all his roughness, and when a young man finds that an  accident deprives him of a quarter of a million of money and leaves him  without a sixpence beyond his commission in a marching regiment under  orders for a convict settlement, he has some reason to rail against  fate.\"    \"How was it that the son came in for the money after all, then?\"    \"Why, it seems that when old Devine returned from sending for his lawyer  to alter his will, he got a fit of apoplexy, the result of his rage, I  suppose, and when they opened his room door in the morning they found  him dead.\"    \"And the son's away on the sea somewhere,\" said Mr. Vickers \"and knows  nothing of his good fortune. It is quite a romance.\"    \"I am glad that Frere did not get the money,\" said Pine, grimly sticking  to his prejudice; \"I have seldom seen a face I liked less, even among my  yellow jackets yonder.\"    \"Oh dear, Dr. Pine! How can you?\" interjected Mrs. Vickers. \"'Pon my  soul, ma'am, some of them have mixed in good society, I can tell you.  There's pickpockets and swindlers down below who have lived in the best  company.\"    \"Dreadful wretches!\" cried Mrs. Vickers, shaking out her skirts. \"John,  I will go on deck.\"    At the signal, the party rose.    \"Ecod, Pine,\" says Captain Blunt, as the two were left alone together,  \"you and I are always putting our foot into it!\"    \"Women are always in the way aboard ship,\" returned Pine.    \"Ah! Doctor, you don't mean that, I know,\" said a rich soft voice at his  elbow.    It was Sarah Purfoy emerging from her cabin.    \"Here is the wench!\""]]]
