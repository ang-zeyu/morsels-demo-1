Now put ef under cd and ij, and over ab and kl; then put gh  over cd and ij, and under kl and ab. See that the two ends of all  the straws are equidistant from the center crossing.    In step 3 the straws are changed from pairs to singles as follows:  Bring a over i; e over d; i over h; d over l; h over a; and l over e.    Step 4. The most convenient way to perform the next process is to take  all the bottom straws in the left hand and allow the top straws to  float over the closed fist. Then the weaving is done with the right  hand. However, for beginners the weaving may also be done on the table.    In weaving, place c under b, over a and under k; d over b and under a;  g under f, over e and under b; h over f and under e; k under j, over  i and under f; l over j and under i; b under c, over d and under a;  a over c and under d; f under g, over h and under c; e over g and  under h; j under k, over l and under g; i over k and under l; the  round is then finished.    Step 5. This illustrates the manner of adding straws. Straw x is  placed under c, over h, under g and then bent back. The bend should  be in the middle of the straw.    Step 6. In this the right end of the added straw x is brought down  over j and under i.    Step 7 shows how to continue the additions by weaving one straw and  then adding one.    Step 8 shows the mat after the first round of additions has been  completed. The weaving is now easy. Weave entirely around again without  any additions, turning five straws each time. Then go around again  weaving two and adding one, in the same manner as before, turning  seven straws each time. As the diameter of the mat increases, the  less often is it necessary to add. But be sure to add enough to keep  the weaving close and the mat perfectly flat.    Step 9 shows how to close the edge of the mat by turning back the  straws on each other. It also gives a very pretty \"woven in\" design  for a border, which can easily be followed from the plate.        Square Center.    Steps for commencing a circular mat with a square beginning are  illustrated in Plate XXI. The additions at the corner are made in  the same manner as explained in the radiating center, except that  each is for a fourth of a circle instead of a complete circle.        Decorations for Round Mats.    Decorations are often employed in round mats. (See Plates XXII and  XXIII.) The most usual are concentric or radiating colored bands of  either simple or sawali weaves.        Hexagonal Weave.    Step 1. In Plate XXIV, place straws 1 and 2 parallel; then put 3  under 2 and over 1; put 4 under 1 and over 2.    Step 2. Put 5 over 1 and 4 and under 2 and 3; put 6 under 1 and 4  and over 2 and 3.    Step 3. Put a over 5 and 6 and under 1 and 2. Put b over 1, 2 and a,  and under 3 and 4. Put c under a, over 4, 3, b, and under 6, 5.    Step 4. Put d under b, over 6, 5, c, and under 2, 1, e. Put e under  c, over 2, 1, d, under 3, 4, and over a. Put f under d, over 3, 4,  e, under 5, 6, a, and over b.    Step 5 is made open so as to show the triple over and under  weave. Further weaving is merely a repetition of this process, as  shown in step 6.    Step 7 shows the turning of the straws on finishing the edge of  the mat.    Step 8. Many designs can be made by inserting colored straws into  the natural weave. Step 8 illustrates three of these embroidered  designs--the star, the bar, and the diamond.        Embroidered Mats.    The embroidering of mats is easily done and the method is shown in  Plate XXVI. Mats in over and under weave, of solid color (either  natural or dyed), are used, and the embroidery is done with colored  straws. Plate XXVII illustrates an embroidered color panel. Floral,  geometrical, and conventionalized designs are discussed under the  headings \"Samar mats\" and \"Special designs.\"          MAT MATERIALS.      Many Philippine mat materials have been described in a former  publication on hats. [6] Only additional and new information is  written here and such data from Bulletin 33 as are necessary to make  a connected article. [7]        Buri Straw.    The Buri Palm.    There are about six species of the genus Corypha in tropical Asia,  but only one of these is found in the Philippines; this is Corypha  elata, the buri palm. [8] It is widely distributed throughout the  Philippines but is most abundant in the central part of the Pampanga  valley and in southern Tayabas.    Mr. C. W. Franks, formerly Division Superintendent of Schools for  Mindoro Province, had a careful estimate made by his teaching force  of the stands of buri palms on the Island of Mindoro. It was found  that 5,000 hectares of land on this island are covered by 2,000,000  buri palms, of which 225,000, or about 12 per cent, are mature trees.    The Island of Burias, the Isla Verde, and other small islands are  fairly covered with the palm. The Province of Sorsogon, including the  Island of Masbate, is also well supplied. In the Visayas there are  districts in Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol, where many buri trees  are found.    The buri is the largest palm that grows in the Philippines, attaining  a height of 20 meters. Its trunk is very erect, spirally ridged and  up to 0.7 meter in diameter. Its wood is of no commercial value.    The full-grown leaves may be three meters long. They are spherical  in outline and the lower one-third or one-half is entire, like  the palm of the hand. The upper part is divided into from 80 to 100  segments each from 1.5 to 6 cm. wide and appearing like fingers spread  apart. The petioles supporting the leaves are about 3 meters long and  20 cm. thick, and are provided with long, stout, curved spines. Both  margins and spines are black in color. At flowering time all the  leaves are shed. The young leaf grows out from the top of the palm  with the segments pressed together in the form of a lance.    The buri flowers and fruits but once and then dies. This is said  to occur when the plant is from 25 to 40 years old. The individual  flowers are greenish-white in color and only from 5 to 6 mm. in  diameter. They are nevertheless perfect flowers, with calyx, corolla,  and ovary showing plainly a division into threes, and stamens six  in number. Thousands of these flowers occur on the large, terminal,  much branched, pyramidal inflorescence which may grow to be 7 meters in  height. The lower branches of this inflorescence may be as much as 3.5  meters long, the upper shorter, the highest about one meter in length.    From 10 to 12 months after flowering the fruits are mature. They are  from 2 to 2.5 cm. in diameter and each contains an extremely hard  seed 1.5 cm. in diameter.        Preparation.    Buri straw is prepared from the young, unopened leaf of the buri  palm. The coarsest straw is made by separating the leaflets from  the midribs and drying them in the sun. A higher grade straw results  from boiling them in water. Such straws are suitable only for bayon  manufacture and for weaving into coarse mats for baling purposes.    Several methods of bleaching buri straw obtain in various  localities. Any exact description of the processes is somewhat  difficult, since the persons who produce the straw have no very  definite idea of the proportions and quantities of various materials  which they use, and often do not care to divulge what they consider  trade secrets. In several cases, nevertheless, supervising teachers  have succeeded in obtaining fairly exact data on the preparation of  buri straw.    However, the same method carried out in different towns seems to  result in different qualities of straw. These differences probably  result from slight variations in the method of preparation. It has  also been found that the age of the leaf, as determined by the length  of the stem (petiole), influences the color of the straw produced. In  some districts the unopened leaf is not taken if the stem is over  two inches in length. In other places, leaves with stems about one  foot high are considered ready to cut. It is probable, too, that the  composition of the water in which the straw is boiled influences its  color. Mauban, in Tayabas province, has the reputation of producing  the whitest buri straw. Mr. John H. Finnigan, supervising teacher,  attempted to introduce buri straw into the schools of Gumaca,  Tayabas, where the buri palm is very plentiful. The work was in  charge of expert weavers from Mauban, but only a poor quality of  straw was produced. It was claimed that the water in which the  segments were boiled, according to the process which is explained  later, did not whiten them. It is a fact that in Mauban the water  of the town fountain is used to produce the fine white straw. In the  several years of his experience, Mr. Finnigan found no place outside  of Mauban which produces straw equal in color to the Mauban straw,  but he has noted that the second best straw comes from San Fernando,  Gumaca, where there is an especially clear stream of water.    In fact, all reports would seem to indicate that clear, pure water  is essential to the production of the finest white buri straw, and  only such should be used in all processes of the various methods  outlined here.    The Arayat Process.--Mr. Robert Clauson, supervising teacher, has  determined the process of whitening buri straw in Arayat, Pampanga,  as follows: The segments are separated from the midrib and rolled  rather loosely, so that the water may pass between them, in bundles  as large around as a plate. These are placed in a large can or  vat containing tamarind leaves and alum (see bleaching agents) in  water, and the whole is boiled until about one-half of the water has  evaporated. During the boiling the buri must be tightly covered with  tamarind leaves and not be allowed to project from the water. After  this process the rolls are placed in a jar full of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#5)"],[1,"  From what has been said above about midriff and rib breathing _versus_  collar-bone breathing, the folly of tight-lacing, or, indeed, of in any  way interfering with the freedom of the waist, will be at once apparent.  We pride ourselves upon our civilization; we make a boast of living in  the age of science; physiology is now taught, or at least talked of, in  almost every school; the laws of health are proclaimed in lectures and  lessons innumerable all over the country, and we laugh at barbarous  customs of other nations, such, for instance, as that of Chinese women  preventing the growth of their feet by forcing them into boots of only  half their proper size. And yet our ladies wear instruments of torture  called corsets, altering the shape of their bodies, and positively  driving the lower ribs _into the lungs_! Now which folly is the  greater--that of doubling up the toes, or of crippling the body in its  most vital parts? Let ladies answer the question, and let them further  most solemnly consider that the girls of to-day are the mothers of  to-morrow, and that upon the measure of their own health and strength  depends the well-being of coming generations.    It is only fair to add, that if the practice of interfering with the  freedom of the waist is reprehensible in the case of ladies, it is, in  one sense, still more so in the case of the male sex, because, as has  been shown before, men depend more for their breathing upon the action  of the abdominal muscle than women. They should, therefore, neither wear  tight-fitting vests, nor suspend their pantaloons by means of  waistbands, belts, or buckles. Loose garments and braces are the proper  thing, though the latter are commonly, but erroneously, considered to be  injurious. _Abdominal_ belts may be worn with advantage by persons of  either sex requiring their support; but these are very different from  stays or waist-bands. I find that an enterprising firm is advertising  corsets for gentlemen (!), and a woodcut may be seen in some papers  representing a young Adonis laced up in regular ladies' fashion, so  that, if it were not for his luxurious moustache, one would certainly  take the drawing to be meant for a woman. It is almost impossible to  imagine that a man could ever make such a fool of himself; on the other  hand, it is clear that these advertisements would not continue to appear  if they did not bring customers. But these poor creatures do not deserve  to be called men, and I am sincerely sorry for them.    With regard to the question whether inspiration should take place  through the mouth or through the nostrils, I must enter my most decided  protest against making it a practice to inhale through the mouth. There  are, of course, occasions when this is unavoidable, as, for instance,  where the singer has rapidly to take what is called a \"half breath.\" But  complete inflation, or, \"full breath,\" is not the work of a moment; it  takes time, and must be done gradually, steadily, and without the  slightest interruption. This should _always_ be done through the  nostrils. The mouth was never intended for breathing, while the nose is  specially and admirably adapted for this purpose. Not only can the lungs  be well and quickly filled through this channel, but it is so cunningly  devised that it acts at the same time as a \"respirator,\" both purifying  and warming the air before it touches the more delicate parts of the  vocal organ. On the other hand, when inhaled through the mouth, the air  carries with it, sometimes right into the voicebox, dust and other  impurities, and its temperature is not materially altered. The  consequence is that the throat and voicebox, when heated by singing or  talking, or by hot rooms, are often exposed to cold, raw, and foggy  winter air, and serious derangements of the respiratory organs are the  natural consequence. If, moreover, this pernicious habit of breathing be  once contracted, we shall soon also sleep with open mouths, thus  parching our throats, and sowing the seeds of many a serious disorder.    On this point I quote a few lines from Dr. Louis Elsberg,[F] professor  of laryngology in the University of New York: \"The natural mode of quiet  breathing is through the nose; mouth-breathing is an acquirement. A  new-born infant would choke to death if you closed its nose; it does not  immediately know how to get air into the lungs through the mouth until  after, by depressing the tongue, you have once made a passage for it.\"    George Catlin, the celebrated traveller among American Indians, became  so thoroughly convinced that the difference between the healthy  condition and physical perfection of these people in their primitive  state, especially their sound teeth and good lungs, and the deplorable  mortality, the numerous diseases and deformities in _civilized_  communities, is mainly due to the habit, common among the latter, of  breathing through the mouth, especially during sleep, that he wrote a  book entitled \"Malrespiration and its Effects upon the Enjoyment and  Life of Man.\" In this book he says, \"If I were to endeavour to bequeath  to posterity the most important motto which human language can convey,  it should be in three words, 'Shut your mouth.' In the social  transactions of life this might have its beneficial results as the most  friendly cautionary advice, or be received as the grossest of insults;  but where I would print and engrave it, in every nursery and on every  bedpost in the universe, its meaning could not be mistaken, and obeyed,  its importance would soon be realized.\"    He also says, \"It is one of the misfortunes of civilization that it has  too many amusing and exciting things for the mouth to say, and too many  delicious things for it to taste, to allow of its being closed during  the day. The mouth therefore has too little reserve for the protection  of its natural purity of expression, and too much exposure for the  protection of its garniture; but, _do keep your mouth shut_ when you  _read_, when you _write_, when you _listen_, when you _are in pain_,  when you are _walking_, when you are _running_, when you are _riding_,  and _by all means when you are angry_! There is _no person_ but who will  find and acknowledge _improvement_ in _health_ and _enjoyment_ from even  a temporary attention to this advice.\"    Again he says, \"There is a proverb, as old and unchangeable as their  hills, amongst North American Indians, 'My son, if thou wouldst be wise,  open first thy eyes; thy ears next, and last of all thy mouth, that thy  words may be words of wisdom, and give no advantage to thine adversary.'  This might be adopted with good effect in _civilized_ life; he who would  _strictly adhere_ to it would be sure to reap its benefits in his  _waking_ hours, and would _soon find_ the habit running into his hours  of _rest_, into which he would _calmly_ enter; dismissing the nervous  anxieties of the day, as he firmly closed his teeth and his lips, only  to be opened _after_ his eyes and his ears in the morning, the rest of  _such_ sleep would bear him daily and hourly proof of its value.\"    Catlin regards the habit of sleeping with the mouth open the most  pernicious of _all bad habits_. The horrors of nightmare and snoring  are, according to him, but the _least_ of its evil effects. He thinks  \"for the greater portion of the thousands and tens of thousands of  persons suffering with weakness of lungs, with bronchitis, asthma,  indigestion, and other affections of the digestive and respiratory  organs,\" the correction of this habit is a _panacea_ for their ills!    He insists that \"_mothers_ should be looked to as the first and  principal _correctors_ of this most destructive of human habits; ... and  the united and simultaneous efforts of the civilized world should be  exerted in the overthrow of a monster so destructive to the good looks  and life of man. Every physician should advise his patients, and every  boarding-school in existence and every hospital should have its surgeon  or matron, and every regiment its officer, to make their nightly and  hourly 'rounds,' to force a _stop_ to so unnatural, disgusting, and  dangerous a habit! Under the working of such a system, mothers guarding  and helping the helpless, schoolmasters their scholars, hospital  surgeons their patients, generals their soldiers, and the rest of the  world protecting themselves, a few years would show the glorious results  in the bills of mortality, and the next generation would be a  _regeneration_ of the human race.\"    =The Windpipe= (pl. I, W).--Having examined the bellows of our vocal  organ, we next notice the windpipe, by means of which the air is carried  into and out of the lungs. It is an elastic tube kept open by 18 or 20  rings which do not quite meet at the back. It enters the lungs by means  of two smaller tubes, which in their turn branch out very much like the  roots of a tree, until their ramifications end in the microscopic cells  of the lungs. The windpipe is capable of being slightly elongated or  shortened, and narrowed or widened, and its interior is covered with a  mucous membrane, which, as its name implies, is continually kept in a  moist state.    =The Voicebox, or Larynx= (pl. V) may be described as resembling a funnel,  the upper part of which has been bent into a triangular shape. Its front  corner (pl. V, 1) may be both seen and felt in the throat, and the  general position of the voicebox is thereby at once indicated. The  framework of the voicebox consists of five parts. 1st. The Ring  cartilage (pl. V, 2) is so named on account of its general resemblance  to a signet ring. It is narrow in front, and has the part corresponding  to the seal behind; the upper border (pl. V, 8, 4) rises very  considerably towards the back, where it is about an inch high. 2nd.  Riding upon this, as it were, with its hollow part towards the back,  is the Shield cartilage (pl.
