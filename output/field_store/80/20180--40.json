In a country covered with woods of the  hardest timber, the clearing of a small field destined for culture  required the united efforts of a tribe, and was a work of much time and  great toil.'    The religion of the Algonquin Indians seems to have been a rude nature  worship. The Sun, as the great giver of warmth and light, was the  object of their adoration; to a lesser degree, they looked upon fire as  a superhuman thing, worthy of worship. The four winds of heaven,  bringing storm and rain from the unknown boundaries of the world, were  regarded as spirits. Each Indian clan or section of a tribe chose for  its special devotion an animal, the name of which became the  distinctive symbol of the clan. This is what is meant by the 'totems'  of the different branches of a tribe.    The Algonquins knew nothing of the art of writing, beyond rude pictures  scratched or painted on wood. The Algonquin tribes, as we have seen,  roamed far to the west. One branch frequented the upper Saskatchewan  river. Here the ashes of the prairie fires discoloured their moccasins  and turned them black, and, in consequence, they were called the  Blackfeet Indians. Even when they moved to other parts of the country,  the name was still applied to them.    Occupying the stretch of country to the south of the Algonquins was the  famous race known as the Iroquoian Family. We generally read of the  Hurons and the Iroquois as separate tribes. They really belonged,  however, to one family, though during the period of Canadian history in  which they were prominent they had become deadly enemies. When Cartier  discovered the St Lawrence and made his way to the island of Montreal,  Huron Indians inhabited all that part of the country. When Champlain  came, two generations later, they had vanished from that region, but  they still occupied a part of Ontario around Lake Simcoe and south and  east of Georgian Bay. We always connect the name Iroquois with that  part of the stock which included the allied Five Nations--the Mohawks,  Onondagas, Senecas, Oneidas, and Cayugas,--and which occupied the  country between the Hudson river and Lake Ontario. This proved to be  the strongest strategical position in North America. It lies in the gap  or break of the Alleghany ridge, the one place south of the St Lawrence  where an easy and ready access is afforded from the sea-coast to the  interior of the continent. Any one who casts a glance at the map of the  present Eastern states will realize this, and will see why it is that  New York, at the mouth of the Hudson, has become the greatest city of  North America. Now, the same reason which has created New York gave to  the position of the Five Nations its great importance in Canadian  history. But in reality the racial stock of the Iroquois extended much  farther than this, both west and south. It took in the well-known tribe  of the Eries, and also the Indians of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac.  It included even the Tuscaroras of the Roanoke in North Carolina, who  afterwards moved north and changed the five nations into six.    The Iroquois were originally natives of the plain, connected very  probably with the Dakotas of the west. But they moved eastwards from  the Mississippi valley towards Niagara, conquering as they went. No  other tribe could compare with them in either bravery or ferocity. They  possessed in a high degree both the virtues and the vices of Indian  character--the unflinching courage and the diabolical cruelty which  have made the Indian an object of mingled admiration and contempt. In  bodily strength and physical endurance they were unsurpassed. Even in  modern days the enervating influence of civilization has not entirely  removed the original vigour of the strain. During the American Civil  War of fifty years ago the five companies of Iroquois Indians recruited  in Canada and in the state of New York were superior in height and  measurement to any other body of five hundred men in the northern  armies.    When the Iroquoian Family migrated, the Hurons settled in the western  peninsula of Ontario. The name of Lake Huron still recalls their abode.  But a part of the race kept moving eastward. Before the coming of the  whites, they had fought their way almost to the sea. But they were able  to hold their new settlements only by hard fighting. The great stockade  which Cartier saw at Hochelaga, with its palisades and fighting  platforms, bore witness to the ferocity of the struggle. At that place  Cartier and his companions were entertained with gruesome tales of  Indian fighting and of wholesale massacres. Seventy years later, in  Champlain's time, the Hochelaga stockade had vanished, and the Hurons  had been driven back into the interior. But for nearly two centuries  after Champlain the Iroquois retained their hold on the territory from  Lake Ontario to the Hudson. The conquests and wars of extermination of  these savages, and the terror which they inspired, have been summed up  by General Francis Walker in the saying: 'They were the scourge of God  upon the aborigines of the continent.'    The Iroquois were in some respects superior to most of the Indians of  the continent. Though they had a limited agriculture, and though they  made hardly any use of metals, they had advanced further in other  directions than most savages. They built of logs, houses long enough to  be divided into several compartments, with a family in each  compartment. By setting a group of houses together, and surrounding  them with a palisade of stakes and trees set on end, the settlement was  turned into a kind of fort, and could bid defiance to the limited means  of attack possessed by their enemies. Inside their houses they kept a  good store of corn, pumpkins and dried meat, which belonged not to each  man singly but to the whole group in common. This was the type of  settlement seen at Quebec and at Hochelaga, and, later on, among the  Five Nations. Indeed, the Five Nations gave to themselves the  picturesque name of the Long House, for their confederation resembled,  as it were, the long wooden houses that held the families together.    All this shows that the superiority of the Iroquois over their enemies  lay in organization. In this they were superior even to their kinsmen  the Hurons. All Indian tribes kept women in a condition which we should  think degrading. The Indian women were drudges; they carried the  burdens, and did the rude manual toil of the tribe. Among the Iroquois,  however, women were not wholly despised; sometimes, if of forceful  character, they had great influence in the councils of the tribe. Among  the Hurons, on the other hand, women were treated with contempt or  brutal indifference. The Huron woman, worn out with arduous toil,  rapidly lost the brightness of her youth. At an age when the women of a  higher culture are still at the height of their charm and  attractiveness the woman of the Hurons had degenerated into a  shrivelled hag, horrible to the eye and often despicable in character.  The inborn gentleness of womanhood had been driven from her breast by  ill-treatment. Not even the cruelest of the warriors surpassed the  unhallowed fiendishness of the withered squaw in preparing the torments  of the stake and in shrieking her toothless exultation beside the  torture fire.    Where women are on such a footing as this it is always ill with the  community at large. The Hurons were among the most despicable of the  Indians in their manners. They were hideous gluttons, gorging  themselves when occasion offered with the rapacity of vultures.  Gambling and theft flourished among them. Except, indeed, for the  tradition of courage in fight and of endurance under pain we can find  scarcely anything in them to admire.    North and west from the Algonquins and Huron-Iroquois were the family  of tribes belonging to the Athapascan stock. The general names of  Chipewyan and Tinne are also applied to the same great branch of the  Indian race. In a variety of groups and tribes, the Athapascans spread  out from the Arctic to Mexico. Their name has since become connected  with the geography of Canada alone, but in reality a number of the  tribes of the plains, like the well-known Apaches, as well as the Hupas  of California and the Navahos, belong to the Athapascans. In Canada,  the Athapascans roamed over the country that lay between Hudson Bay and  the Rocky Mountains. They were found in the basin of the Mackenzie  river towards the Arctic sea, and along the valley of the Fraser to the  valley of the Chilcotin. Their language was broken into a great number  of dialects which differed so widely that only the kindred groups could  understand one another's speech. But the same general resemblance ran  through the various branches of the Athapascans. They were a tall,  strong race, great in endurance, during their prime, though they had  little of the peculiar stamina that makes for long life and vigorous  old age. Their descendants of to-day still show the same facial  characteristics--the low forehead with prominent ridge bones, and the  eyes set somewhat obliquely so as to suggest, though probably without  reason, a kinship with Oriental peoples.    The Athapascans stood low in the scale of civilization. Most of them  lived in a prairie country where a luxuriant soil, not encumbered with  trees, would have responded to the slightest labour. But the  Athapascans, in Canada at least, knew nothing of agriculture. With  alternations of starvation and rude plenty, they lived upon the unaided  bounty of tribes of the far north, degraded by want and indolence, were  often addicted to cannibalism.    The Indians beyond the mountains, between the Rockies and the sea, were  for the most part quite distinct from those of the plains. Some tribes  of the Athapascans, as we have seen, penetrated into British Columbia,  but the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#5)"],[1,"didn't talk with him?\"    \"We couldn't. You wouldn't expect him to shout at me across the  railing! Only, whenever I walked round the deck, he seemed to be  there.\"    \"Staring!\"    \"He may not have been staring at me. Probably, he was just looking  the way the ship was going, and thinking of some girl in New York. I  don't think you can make much of a romance out of it, father.\"    \"I don't want to, my dear. Princes don't travel in the  second-cabin.\"    \"He may have been a prince in disguise.\"    \"More likely a drummer,\" grunted Mr. McEachern.    \"Drummers are often quite nice, aren't they?\"    \"Princes are nicer.\"    \"Well, I'll go to bed and dream of the nicest one I can think of.  Come along, dogs. Stop biting my slipper, Tommy. Why can't you  behave, like Rastus? Still, you don't snore, do you? Aren't you  going to bed soon, father? I believe you've been sitting up late and  getting into all sorts of bad habits while I've been away. I'm sure  you have been smoking too much. When you've finished that cigar,  you're not even to think of another till to-morrow. Promise!\"    \"Not one?\"    \"Not one. I'm not going to have my father getting like the people  you read about in the magazine advertisements. You don't want to  feel sudden shooting pains, do you?\"    \"No, my dear.\"    \"And have to take some awful medicine?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then, promise.\"    \"Very well, my dear. I promise.\"    As the door closed, the captain threw away the stump he was smoking,  and remained for a moment in thought. Then, he drew another cigar  from his case, lighted it, and resumed the study of the little  note-book. It was past three o'clock when he went to his bedroom.          CHAPTER V    A THIEF IN THE NIGHT      How long the light had been darting about the room like a very much  enlarged firefly, Jimmy did not know. It seemed to him like hours,  for it had woven itself into an incoherent waking dream of his; and  for a moment, as the mists of sleep passed away from his brain, he  fancied that he was dreaming still. Then, sleep left him, and he  realized that the light, which was now moving slowly across the  bookcase, was a real light.    That the man behind it could not have been there long was plain, or  he would have seen the chair and its occupant. He seemed to be  taking the room step by step. As Jimmy sat up noiselessly and  gripped the arms of the chair in readiness for a spring, the light  passed from the bookcase to the table. Another foot or so to the  left, and it would have fallen on Jimmy.    From the position of the ray, Jimmy could see that the burglar was  approaching on his side of the table. Though until that day he had  not been in the room for two months, its geography was clearly  stamped on his mind's eye. He knew almost to a foot where his  visitor was standing. Consequently, when, rising swiftly from the  chair, he made a football dive into the darkness, it was no  speculative dive. It had a conscious aim, and it was not restrained  by any uncertainty as to whether the road to the burglar's knees was  clear or not.    His shoulder bumped into a human leg. His arms closed  instantaneously on it, and pulled. There was a yelp of dismay, and a  crash. The lantern bounced away across the room, and wrecked itself  on the reef of the steam-heater. Its owner collapsed in a heap on  top of Jimmy.    Jimmy, underneath at the fall, speedily put himself uppermost with a  twist of his body. He had every advantage. The burglar was a small  man, and had been taken very much by surprise, and any fight there  might have been in him in normal circumstances had been shaken out  of him by the fall. He lay still, not attempting to struggle.    Jimmy half-rose, and, pulling his prisoner by inches to the door,  felt up the wall till he found the electric-light button.    The yellow glow that flooded the room disclosed a short, stocky  youth of obviously Bowery extraction. A shock of vivid red hair was  the first thing about him that caught the eye. A poet would have  described it as Titian. Its proprietor's friends and acquaintances  probably called it \"carrots.\" Looking up at Jimmy from under this  wealth of crimson was a not unpleasing face. It was not handsome,  certainly; but there were suggestions of a latent good-humor. The  nose had been broken at one period of its career, and one of the  ears was undeniably of the cauliflower type; but these are little  accidents which may happen to any high-spirited young gentleman. In  costume, the visitor had evidently been guided rather by individual  taste than by the dictates of fashion. His coat was of rusty black,  his trousers of gray, picked out with stains of various colors.  Beneath the coat was a faded red-and-white sweater. A hat of soft  felt lay on the floor by the table.    The cut of the coat was poor, and the fit of it spoiled by a bulge  in one of the pockets. Diagnosing this bulge correctly, Jimmy  inserted his hand, and drew out a dingy revolver.    \"Well?\" he said, rising.    Like most people, he had often wondered what he should do if he were  to meet a burglar; and he had always come to the conclusion that  curiosity would be his chief emotion. His anticipations were proved  perfectly correct. Now that he had abstracted his visitor's gun, he  had no wish to do anything but engage him in conversation. A  burglar's life was something so entirely outside his experience! He  wanted to learn the burglar's point of view. Incidentally, he  reflected with amusement, as he recalled his wager, he might pick up  a few useful hints.    The man on the floor sat up, and rubbed the back of his head  ruefully.    \"Gee!\" he muttered. \"I t'ought some guy had t'rown de buildin' at  me.\"    \"It was only little me,\" said Jimmy. \"Sorry if I hurt you at all.  You really want a mat for that sort of thing.\"    The man's hand went furtively to his pocket. Then, his eye caught  sight of the revolver, which Jimmy had placed on the table. With a  sudden dash, he seized it.    \"Now, den, boss!\" he said, between his teeth.    Jimmy extended his hand, and unclasped it. Six shells lay in the  palm.    \"Why worry?\" he said. \"Sit down and let us talk of life.\"    \"It's a fair cop, boss,\" said the man, resignedly.    \"Away with melancholy,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm not going to call the  police. You can beat it whenever you like.\"    The man stared.    \"I mean it,\" said Jimmy. \"What's the trouble? I've no grievance. I  wish, though, if you haven't any important engagement, you would  stop and talk awhile first.\"    A broad grin spread itself across the other's face. There was  something singularly engaging about him when he grinned.    \"Gee! If youse ain't goin' to call de cops, I'll talk till de  chickens roost ag'in.\"    \"Talking, however,\" said Jimmy, \"is dry work. Are you by any chance  on the wagon?\"    \"What's dat? Me? On your way, boss!\"    \"Then, you'll find a pretty decent whiskey in that decanter. Help  yourself. I think you'll like it.\"    A musical gurgling, followed by a contented sigh, showed that the  statement had been tested and proved correct.    \"Cigar?\" asked Jimmy.    \"Me fer dat,\" assented his visitor.    \"Take a handful.\"    \"I eats dem alive,\" said the marauder jovially, gathering in the  spoils.    Jimmy crossed his legs.    \"By the way,\" he said, \"let there be no secrets between us. What's  your name? Mine is Pitt. James Willoughby Pitt.\"    \"Mullins is my monaker, boss. Spike, dey calls me.\"    \"And you make a living at this sort of thing?\"    \"Not so woise.\"    \"How did you get in here?\"    Spike Mullins grinned.    \"Gee! Ain't de window open?\"    \"If it hadn't been?\"    \"I'd a' busted it.\"    Jimmy eyed the fellow fixedly.    \"Can you use an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe?\" he demanded.    Spike was on the point of drinking. He lowered his glass, and gaped.    \"What's dat?\" he said.    \"An oxy-acetylene blow-pipe.\"    \"Search me,\" said Spike, blankly. \"Dat gets past me.\"    Jimmy's manner grew more severe.    \"Can you make soup?\"    \"Soup, boss?\"    \"He doesn't know what soup is,\" said Jimmy, despairingly. \"My good  man, I'm afraid you have missed your vocation. You have no business  to be trying to burgle. You don't know the first thing about the  game.\"    Spike was regarding the speaker with disquiet over his glass. Till  now, the red-haired one had been very well satisfied with his  methods, but criticism was beginning to sap his nerve. He had heard  tales of masters of his craft who made use of fearsome implements  such as Jimmy had mentioned; burglars who had an airy  acquaintanceship, bordering on insolent familiarity, with the  marvels of science; men to whom the latest inventions were as  familiar as his own jemmy was to himself. Could this be one of that  select band? His host began to take on a new aspect in his eyes.    \"Spike,\" said Jimmy.    \"Huh?\"    \"Have you a thorough knowledge of chemistry, physics--\"    \"On your way, boss!\"    \"--toxicology--\"    \"Search me!\"    \"--electricity and microscopy?\"    \"... Nine, ten. Dat's de finish. I'm down an' out.\"    Jimmy shook his head, sadly.    \"Give up burglary,\" he said. \"It's not in your line. Better try  poultry-farming.\"    Spike twiddled his glass, abashed.    \"Now, I,\" said Jimmy airily, \"am thinking of breaking into a house  to-night.\"    \"Gee!\" exclaimed Spike, his suspicions confirmed at last. \"I t'ought  youse was in de game, boss. Sure, you're de guy dat's onto all de  curves. I t'ought so all along.\"    \"I should like to hear,\" said Jimmy amusedly, as one who draws out  an intelligent child, \"how you would set about burgling one of those  up-town villas. My own work has been on a somewhat larger scale and  on the other side of the Atlantic.\"    \"De odder side?\"    \"I have done as much in London, as anywhere else,\" said Jimmy. \"A  great town, London, full of opportunities for the fine worker. Did  you hear of the cracking of the New Asiatic Bank in Lombard Street?\"    \"No, boss,\" whispered Spike. \"Was dat you?\"   "]]]
