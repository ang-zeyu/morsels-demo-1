By far the most utilized retreat in the dry season in parts of  the range is beneath the outer sheaths of banana plants. Large numbers  of these frogs were found in banana plants at Cuautlapan, Veracruz, in  March, 1956, in March and December, 1959.    Large breeding congregations of this frog are often found at the time of  the first heavy rains in the wet season. Gadow (1908:76) estimated  45,000 frogs at one breeding site in Veracruz. In the vicinity of  Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, large numbers of individuals were found around rain  pools and roadside ditches in July, 1956, and July, 1958; large  concentrations were found near Chinaja, Guatemala, in June, 1960, and  near Esparta, Costa Rica in July, 1961. Usually males call from the  ground at the edge of the water or not infrequently sit in shallow  water, but sometimes males call from bushes and low trees around the  water. Stuart (1935:38) recorded individuals calling and breeding  throughout the day at La Libertad, Guatemala. _Smilisca baudini_ usually  is absent from breeding congregations of hylids; frequently _S. baudini_  breeds alone in small temporary pools separated from large ponds where  numerous other species are breeding. In Guerrero and Oaxaca, Mexico, _S.  baudini_ breeds in the same ponds with _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_, _Bufo  marmoreus_, _Engystomops pustulosus_, and _Diaglena reticulata_, and in  the vicinity of Esparta, Costa Rica, _S. baudini_ breeds in ponds with  _Bufo coccifer_, _Hyla staufferi_, and _Phrynohyas venulosa_. In nearly  all instances the breeding sites of _S. baudini_ are shallow, temporary  pools.    The breeding call of _Smilisca baudini_ consists of a series of short  explosive notes. Each note has a duration of 0.09 to 0.13 seconds; two  to 15 notes make up a call group. Individual call groups are spaced from  about 15 seconds to several minutes apart. The notes are moderately  high-pitched and resemble \"wonk-wonk-wonk.\" Little vibration is  discernible in the notes, which have 140 to 195 pulses per second and a  dominant frequency of 2400 to 2725 cycles per second (Pl. 10A).    The eggs are laid as a surface film on the water in temporary pools. The  only membrane enclosing the individual eggs is the vitelline membrane.  In ten eggs (KU 62154 from San Salvador, El Salvador) the average  diameter of the embryos in first cleavage is 1.3 mm. and of the  vitelline membranes, 1.5 mm. Hatchling tadpoles have body lengths of 2.6  to 2.7 mm. and total lengths of 5.1 to 5.4 mm. The body and caudal  musculature is brown; the fins are densely flecked with brown. The gills  are long and filamentous. Growth and development of tadpoles are  summarized in Table 9.    A typical tadpole in stage 30 of development (KU 60018 from Chinaja,  Alta Verapaz, Guatemala) has a body length of 8.7 mm., a tail length of  13.6 mm., and a total length of 22.3 mm.; body slightly wider than deep;  snout rounded dorsally and laterally; eyes widely separated, directed  dorsolaterally; nostril about midway between eye and tip of snout; mouth  anteroventral; spiracle sinistral, located about midway on length of  body and slightly below midline; anal tube dextral; caudal musculature  slender, slightly curved upward distally; dorsal fin extending onto  body, deepest at about one-third length of tail; depth of dorsal fin  slightly more than that of ventral fin at mid-length of tail; dorsal  part of body dark brown; pale crescent-shaped mark on posterior part of  body; ventral surfaces transparent with scattered brown pigment  ventrolaterally, especially below eye; caudal musculature pale tan with  a dark brown longitudinal streak on middle of anterior one-third of  tail; dorsum of anterior one-third of tail dark brown; brown flecks and  blotches on rest of caudal musculature, on all of dorsal fin, and on  posterior two-thirds of ventral fin; iris bronze in life (Fig. 11).  Mouth small; median third of upper lip bare; rest of mouth bordered by  two rows of conical papillae; lateral fold present; tooth rows 2/3; two  upper rows about equal in length; second row broadly interrupted  medially, three lower rows complete, first and second equal in length,  slightly shorter than upper rows; third lower row shortest; first upper  row sharply curved anteriorly in midline; upper beak moderately deep,  forming a board arch with slender lateral processes; lower beak more  slender, broadly V-shaped; both beaks bearing blunt serrations  (Fig. 15A).    In tadpoles having fully developed mouthparts the tooth-row formula of  2/3 is invariable, but the coloration is highly variable. The color and  pattern described above is about average. Some tadpoles are much  darker, such as those from 11 kilometers north of Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca,  (KU 87639-44), 3.5 kilometers east of Yokdzonot, Yucatan (KU 71720), and  4 kilometers west-southwest Puerto Juarez, Quintana Roo, Mexico (KU  71721), whereas others, notably from 17 kilometers northeast of  Juchatengo, Oaxaca, Mexico (KU 87645), are much paler and lack the dark  markings on the caudal musculature. The variation in intensity of  pigmentation possibly can be correlated with environmental conditions,  especially the amount of light. In general, tadpoles that were found in  open, sunlit pools are pallid by comparison with those from shaded  forest pools. These subjective comparisons were made with preserved  specimens; detailed comparative data on living tadpoles are not  available.    The relative length and depth of the tail are variable; in some  individuals the greatest depth of the tail is about at mid-length of the  tail, whereas in most specimens the tail is deepest at about one-third  its length. The length of the tail relative to the total length  is usually 58 to 64 per cent in tadpoles in stages 29 and 30 of  development. In some individuals the tail is about 70 per cent of the  total length. On the basis of the material examined, these variations in  proportions do not show geographical trends. Probably the proportions  are a reflection of crowding of the tadpoles in the pools where they are  developing or possibly due to water currents or other environmental  factors.    Stuart (1948:26) described and illustrated the tadpole of _Smilisca  baudini_ from Finca Chejel, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. The description and  figures agree with ours, except that the first lower tooth row does not  have a sharp angle medially in Stuart's figure. He (1948:27) stated that  color in tadpoles from different localities probably varies with  soil color and turbidity of water. Maslin (1963:125) described and  illustrated tadpoles of _S. baudini_ from Piste, Yucatan, Mexico. These  specimens are heavily pigmented like specimens that we have examined  from the Yucatan Peninsula and from other places in the range of the  species. Maslin stated that the anal tube is median in the specimens  that he examined; we have not studied Maslin's specimens, but all  tadpoles of _Smilisca_ that we have examined have a dextral anal tube.    Newly metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 12.0 to 15.5 mm.  (average 13.4 in 23 specimens). The largest young are from La Libertad,  El Peten, Guatemala; these have snout-vent lengths of 14.0 to 15.5 mm.  (average 14.5 in five specimens). Young from 11 kilometers north of  Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, are the smallest and have snout-vent  lengths of 12.0 to 12.5 mm. (average 12.3 in three specimens). Recently  metamorphosed young usually are dull olive green above and white below;  brown transverse bands are visible on the hind limbs. The labial  markings characteristic of the adults are represented only by a creamy  white suborbital spot, which is a good diagnostic mark for young of this  species. In life the iris is pale gold.    _Remarks_: The considerable variation in color and the extensive  geographic distribution of _Smilisca baudini_ have resulted in the  proposal of eight specific names for the frogs that we consider to  represent one species. Dumeril and Bibron (1841:564) proposed the name  _Hyla baudini_ for a specimen (MNHN 4798) from Mexico. Smith and Taylor  (1950:347) restricted the type locality to Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico, an  area where the species occurs in abundance. Baird (1854:61) named _Hyla  vanvlieti_ from Brownsville, Texas, and (1859:35) labelled the figures  of _Hyla vanvlieti_ [= _Hyla baudini_] on plate 38 as _Hyla vociferans_,  a _nomen nudum_. Cope (1862:359) named _Hyla muricolor_ from Mirador,  Veracruz, Mexico, and (1865:194) used the name _Smilisca daulinia_ for  a skeleton that he employed as the basis for the cranial characters  diagnostic of the genus _Smilisca_, as defined by him. Although we  cannot be certain, Cope apparently inadvertently used _daulinia_ for  _baudini_, just as he used _daudinii_ for _baudini_ (1871:205). Brocchi  (1877:125) named _Hyla pansosana_ from Panzos, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala.

This,  with many others near it, spoke of days of civilisation that had long  since passed away, before the Naga drove the Cacharee from the hills he  now inhabits, and from the rich valley of the Dunseree. Near Dimapur  we passed a Meekir hut built on posts ten or twelve feet high, and  with a notched log resting against it, at an angle of about seventy  degrees by way of a staircase, up which a dog ran like a squirrel  at our approach. The Meekirs occupy some low hill ranges between the  Naga hills and the Burrhampooter.    The country round Dimapur is exceedingly rich, and everywhere bears  the marks of having been thickly populated. It is well supplied  with artificial square tanks, some much larger than the one already  referred to, and on the opposite bank of the river we crossed to reach  our halting place, are the remains of an old fortified city. Mounds  containing broken pottery made with the wheel, abound, though the  neighbouring tribes have forgotten its use. At Dimapur, in those days,  there were three or four Government elephants and a few shops kept by  \"Khyahs,\" an enterprising race of merchants from Western India.    The ruined city is worth describing. It was surrounded originally by  solid brick walls twelve feet in height and six in thickness, the  bricks admirably made and burned. The walls enclosed a space seven  hundred yards square; it was entered by a Gothic archway, and not far  off had a gap in the wall, said to have been made for cattle to enter  by. Inside were tanks, some lined with brick walls, and with brick  steps leading to the water. Though I carefully explored the interior,  I never saw any other traces of brickwork, except perhaps a platform;  but I found one or two sacrificial stones, for offerings of flowers,  water and oil. One corner of the surrounding wall had been cut away  by the river. The enclosure is covered with forest. Near the gateway  are some huge monoliths, one eighteen feet in height. All are covered  with sculpture, and some have deep grooves cut in the top, as if to  receive beams. It is difficult to conjecture what they were brought  there for, and how they were transported, as the nearest rocks from  which they could have been cut, are at least ten miles away. If the  Assam-Bengal Railway passes near Dimapur as is, I believe, arranged,  this interesting old city wall will probably be used as a quarry for  railway purposes, and soon none of it will remain. Alas, for Vandalism!    History tells us little about the origin of Dimapur, but probably it  was once a centre of Cacharee civilisation, and as the Angami Nagas  advanced, the city wall was built, so as to afford a place of refuge  against sudden raids. It is a strange sight to see the relics of a  forgotten civilisation, in the midst of a pathless forest.    On our march up, we frequently came upon the windings of the river  Dunseree. At Nowkatta it runs parallel for a time with the road, and  we took our evening walk on its dry sandbanks, finding many recent  traces of tigers and wild elephants. From that time till we finally  left the hills, the roar of tigers and the trumpeting of elephants  were such common sounds, that we ceased to pay attention to them, and  my wife, though naturally timid, became devoted to the wild solitude  of our life.    At Dimapur we enjoyed the luxury of fresh milk, which, of course,  the forest did not supply. The night was delightfully cold, and the  next morning crisp and invigorating, and we set off at an early hour,  for our last march into Samagudting.    For the first eight miles our road was through a level forest country,  with the exception of a piece of low-lying grass land, and at a place  called Nichu Guard the ascent of the hill commenced. This entrance of  the gorge through which the Diphoo Panee river enters the low lands is  very beautiful, the stream rushing out from the hills over a pebbly  bottom, and it was a favourite encamping ground for us in our later  marches. Now, we had not time to halt, so hurried on. The road up the  hill was in fair condition for men and elephants, but did not admit  of wheeled traffic, had there been any carts to use. We accomplished  the ascent, a distance of four miles, in about two hours, obtaining  several lovely views of the boundless forest, on our way.    The vegetation on the hill itself had been much injured by the  abominable practice hillmen have, of clearing a fresh space every two  or three years, and deserting it for another, when the soil has been  exhausted. This never gives it time to recover. At last we reached  the summit, and took possession of the Political Agent's house, a  large bungalow, built of grass and bamboo, the roof being supported by  wooden posts, on the highest point of the hill. A glance showed me that  the posts were nearly eaten through by white ants, and that the first  high wind would level it with the ground. It had been built by a man  who never intended to stay, and who only wanted it to last his time.    Later in the day, I took over the charge from Mr. Coombs, who was  acting till my arrival, and thus became, for the time, chief of the  district. My staff consisted of Mr. Needham, Assistant Political Agent,  and Mr. Cooper, in medical charge, the usual office establishment,  and one hundred and fifty military police. Most of these, together with  Captain Butler, for whom I was acting, were away in the Interior with  a survey party. Mr. Coombs left in a day or two, and I then occupied  his bungalow lower down the hill, and in a more exposed position, so  as to allow of the larger house being rebuilt. Besides the Government  establishment, we had a fair-sized Naga village on the hill, and  just below the Political Agent's house. These people had long been  friendly to us, and were willing, for a large recompense, to do all  sorts of odd jobs, being entirely free from the caste prejudices of  our Hindoo and degenerate Mussulman fellow-subjects.                CHAPTER II.        Samagudting--Unhealthy quarters--A callous widower--Want of      water--Inhabitants of the Naga Hills--Captain Butler--Other      officials--Our life in the wilds--A tiger carries off the      postman--An Indian forest--Encouragement.      My first impressions of Samagudting, were anything but favourable. It  was eminently a \"make-shift place.\" It had been occupied by us as  a small outpost, from time to time, between 1846 and 1851, but it  was never fit for a permanent post of more than twenty-five men,  as the water supply was bad, there being no springs, and only a few  water holes which were entirely dependent on the uncertain rainfall. A  small tank had been constructed, but it was 500 feet below the summit,  so that water was sold at an almost prohibitive rate. All articles  of food were scarce, dear and bad, wood was enormously dear, and to  crown all, the place was unhealthy and constantly enveloped in fog.    Samagudting [5] ought never to have been occupied, and would not  have been, had the Government taken ordinary precautions to verify  the too roseate reports of an officer who wished to see it adopted  as the headquarters of a new district, as a speedy road to promotion,  and subsequent transfer to a more favoured appointment. The report in  question which, among other things, mentioned the existence of springs  of water, that existed only in imagination, having once been accepted  by the authorities, and a large expenditure incurred, it became a  very invidious task for future Political Agents to unmask the affair,  and proclaim the extreme unsuitability of Samagudting for a station.    Many other good and healthy sites were available, and I believe that  our dealings with the Nagas were greatly retarded, by the adoption  of such an unsuitable post. As it was, having made our road over the  hill, it was necessary to climb an ascent of over two thousand feet,  and an equal descent, before entering the really important portion  of the Angami Naga country. I at once saw that the right entrance  lay by the Diphoo Panee Gorge, and I recommended its adoption. I  began to make this road during the Naga Hills Campaign of 1879-80,  and it has since been regularly used.    Having said all that there was to say against Samagudting, it is  only fair to mention its good points. First, though never so cold in  the winter, as the plains, the temperature was never so high in the  hot and rainy seasons; and when the weather was fine, it was very  enjoyable. The views from the hill were magnificent. To the south,  the Burrail range, from which a broad and undulating valley divided  us. To the west, a long stretch of hills and forests. To the east,  the valley of the Dunseree, bordered by the Rengma and Lotah Naga  hills, a vast forest, stretching as far as the eye could reach,  with here and there a large patch of high grass land, one of which  many miles in extent, was the Rengma Putha, a grand elephant catching  ground in old times, where many a noble elephant became a victim to  the untiring energy of the Bengali elephant phandaits or noosers,  from the Morung. [6] To the north, the view extended over a pathless  forest, the first break being the Doboka Hills. Behind these, a long  bank of mist showed the line of the Burrhampooter, while on clear  days in the cold weather, we might see the dark line of the Bhootan  Hills, with the snowy peaks of the Himalayas towering above them. [7]  Altogether, it was a sight once seen, never to be forgotten.        ------  FIGURE    Samagudting.
