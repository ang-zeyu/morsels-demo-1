They perfectly understood the meaning of the language they  used, and how it would be understood by others; and they knew that it  would not in any part of the civilized world be supposed to embrace  the negro race, which, by common consent, had been excluded from  civilized Governments and the family of nations, and doomed to  slavery. They spoke and acted according to the then established  doctrines and principles, and in the ordinary language of the day, and  no one misunderstood them. The unhappy black race were separated from  the white by indelible marks, and laws long before established, and  were never thought of or spoken of except as property, and when the  claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need  protection.    This state of public opinion had undergone no change when the  Constitution was adopted, as is equally evident from its provisions  and language.    The brief preamble sets forth by whom it was formed, for what  purposes, and for whose benefit and protection. It declares that it  is formed by the _people_ of the United States; that is to say, by  those who were members of the different political communities in the  several States; and its great object is declared to be to secure the  blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity. It speaks in  general terms of the _people_ of the United States, and of _citizens_  of the several States, when it is providing for the exercise of the  powers granted or the privileges secured to the citizen. It does not  define what description of persons are intended to be included under  these terms, or who shall be regarded as a citizen and one of the  people. It uses them as terms so well understood, that no further  description or definition was necessary.    But there are two clauses in the Constitution which point directly and  specifically to the negro race as a separate class of persons, and  show clearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or  citizens of the Government then formed.    One of these clauses reserves to each of the thirteen States the right  to import slaves until the year 1808, if it thinks proper. And the  importation which it thus sanctions was unquestionably of persons of  the race of which we are speaking, as the traffic in slaves in the  United States had always been confined to them. And by the other  provision the States pledge themselves to each other to maintain the  right of property of the master, by delivering up to him any slave who  may have escaped from his service, and be found within their  respective territories. By the first above-mentioned clause,  therefore, the right to purchase and hold this property is directly  sanctioned and authorized for twenty years by the people who framed  the Constitution. And by the second, they pledge themselves to  maintain and uphold the right of the master in the manner specified,  as long as the Government they then formed should endure. And these  two provisions show, conclusively, that neither the description of  persons therein referred to, nor their descendants, were embraced in  any of the other provisions of the Constitution; for certainly these  two clauses were not intended to confer on them or their posterity the  blessings of liberty, or any of the personal rights so carefully  provided for the citizen.    No one of that race had ever migrated to the United States  voluntarily; all of them had been brought here as articles of  merchandise. The number that had been emancipated at that time were  but few in comparison with those held in slavery; and they were  identified in the public mind with the race to which they belonged,  and regarded as a part of the slave population rather than the free.  It is obvious that they were not even in the minds of the framers of  the Constitution when they were conferring special rights and  privileges upon the citizens of a State in every other part of the  Union.    Indeed, when we look to the condition of this race in the several  States at the time, it is impossible to believe that these rights and  privileges were intended to be extended to them.    It is very true, that in that portion of the Union where the labor of  the negro race was found to be unsuited to the climate and  unprofitable to the master, but few slaves were held at the time of  the Declaration of Independence; and when the Constitution was  adopted, it had entirely worn out in one of them, and measures had  been taken for its gradual abolition in several others. But this  change had not been produced by any change of opinion in relation to  this race; but because it was discovered, from experience, that slave  labor was unsuited to the climate and productions of these States: for  some of the States, where it had ceased or nearly ceased to exist,  were actively engaged in the slave trade, procuring cargoes on the  coast of Africa, and transporting them for sale to those parts of the  Union where their labor was found to be profitable, and suited to the  climate and productions. And this traffic was openly carried on, and  fortunes accumulated by it, without reproach from the people of the  States where they resided. And it can hardly be supposed that, in the  States where it was then countenanced in its worst form--that is, in  the seizure and transportation--the people could have regarded those  who were emancipated as entitled to equal rights with themselves.    And we may here again refer, in support of this proposition, to the  plain and unequivocal language of the laws of the several States, some  passed after the Declaration of Independence and before the  Constitution was adopted, and some since the Government went into  operation.    We need not refer, on this point, particularly to the laws of the  present slaveholding States. Their statute books are full of  provisions in relation to this class, in the same spirit with the  Maryland law which we have before quoted. They have continued to treat  them as an inferior class, and to subject them to strict police  regulations, drawing a broad line of distinction between the citizen  and the slave races, and legislating in relation to them upon the same  principle which prevailed at the time of the Declaration of  Independence. As relates to these States, it is too plain for  argument, that they have never been regarded as a part of the people  or citizens of the State, nor supposed to possess any political rights  which the dominant race might not withhold or grant at their  pleasure. And as long ago as 1822, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky  decided that free negroes and mulattoes were not citizens within the  meaning of the Constitution of the United States; and the correctness  of this decision is recognised, and the same doctrine affirmed, in 1  Meigs's Tenn. Reports, 331.    And if we turn to the legislation of the States where slavery had worn  out, or measures taken for its speedy abolition, we shall find the  same opinions and principles equally fixed and equally acted upon.    Thus, Massachusetts, in 1786, passed a law similar to the colonial one  of which we have spoken. The law of 1786, like the law of 1705,  forbids the marriage of any white person with any negro, Indian, or  mulatto, and inflicts a penalty of fifty pounds upon any one who shall  join them in marriage; and declares all such marriages absolutely null  and void, and degrades thus the unhappy issue of the marriage by  fixing upon it the stain of bastardy. And this mark of degradation was  renewed, and again impressed upon the race, in the careful and  deliberate preparation of their revised code published in 1836. This  code forbids any person from joining in marriage any white person with  any Indian, negro, or mulatto, and subjects the party who shall offend  in this respect, to imprisonment, not exceeding six months, in the  common jail, or to hard labor, and to a fine of not less than fifty  nor more than two hundred dollars; and, like the law of 1786, it  declares the marriage to be absolutely null and void. It will be seen  that the punishment is increased by the code upon the person who shall  marry them, by adding imprisonment to a pecuniary penalty.    So, too, in Connecticut. We refer more particularly to the legislation  of this State, because it was not only among the first to put an end  to slavery within its own territory, but was the first to fix a mark  of reprobation upon the African slave trade. The law last mentioned  was passed in October, 1788, about nine months after the State had  ratified and adopted the present Constitution of the United States;  and by that law it prohibited its own citizens, under severe  penalties, from engaging in the trade, and declared all policies of  insurance on the vessel or cargo made in the State to be null and  void. But, up to the time of the adoption of the Constitution, there  is nothing in the legislation of the State indicating any change of  opinion as to the relative rights and position of the white and black  races in this country, or indicating that it meant to place the  latter, when free, upon a level with its citizens. And certainly  nothing which would have led the slaveholding States to suppose, that  Connecticut designed to claim for them, under the new Constitution,  the equal rights and privileges and rank of citizens in every other  State.    The first step taken by Connecticut upon this subject was as early as  1774, when it passed an act forbidding the further importation of  slaves into the State. But the section containing the prohibition is  introduced by the following preamble:    \"And whereas the increase of slaves in this state is injurious to the  poor, and inconvenient.\"    This recital would appear to have been carefully introduced, in order  to prevent any misunderstanding of the motive which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#5)"],[1,"ing, signify: Thou  shalt love Spirit only, not its opposite, in every God-  quality, even in substance; thou shalt recognize thy-  self as God's spiritual child only, and the true man [15]  and true woman, the all-harmonious \"male and female,\"  as of spiritual origin, God's reflection,--thus as chil-  dren of one common Parent,--wherein and whereby  Father, Mother, and child are the divine Principle and  divine idea, even the divine \"Us\"--one in good, and [20]  good in One.    With this recognition man could never separate him-  self from good, God; and he would necessarily entertain  habitual love for his fellow-man. Only by admitting  evil as a reality, and entering into a state of evil [25]  thoughts, can we in belief separate one man's interests  from those of the whole human family, or thus attempt  to separate Life from God. This is the mistake that  causes much that must be repented of and overcome.  Not to know what is blessing you, but to believe that [30]  aught that God sends is unjust,--or that those whom  He commissions bring to you at His demand that which    [Page 19.]    is unjust,--is wrong and cruel. Envy, evil thinking, [1]  evil speaking, covetousness, lust, hatred, malice, are  always wrong, and will break the rule of Christian  Science and prevent its demonstration; but the rod of  God, and the obedience demanded of His servants in [5]  carrying out what He teaches them,--these are never  unmerciful, never unwise.    The task of healing the sick is far lighter than that  of so teaching the divine Principle and rules of Chris-  tian Science as to lift the affections and motives of men [10]  to adopt them and bring them out in human lives. He  who has named the name of Christ, who has virtually  accepted the divine claims of Truth and Love in divine  Science, is daily departing from evil; and all the wicked  endeavors of suppositional demons can never change the [15]  current of that life from steadfastly flowing on to God,  its divine source.    But, taking the livery of heaven wherewith to cover  iniquity, is the most fearful sin that mortals can commit.  I should have more faith in an honest drugging-doctor, [20]  one who abides by his statements and works upon as  high a basis as he understands, healing me, than I could  or would have in a smooth-tongued hypocrite or mental  malpractitioner.    Between the centripetal and centrifugal mental forces [25]  of material and spiritual gravitations, we go into or we  go out of materialism or sin, and choose our course and  its results. Which, then, shall be our choice,--the sin-  ful, material, and perishable, or the spiritual, joy-giving,  and eternal? [30]    The spiritual sense of Life and its grand pursuits is  of itself a bliss, health-giving and joy-inspiring. This    [Page 20.]    sense of Life illumes our pathway with the radiance of [1]  divine Love; heals man spontaneously, morally and  physically,--exhaling the aroma of Jesus' own words,  \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,  and I will give you rest.\" [5]            CHAPTER II. ONE CAUSE AND EFFECT.      [Page 21.]    Christian Science begins with the First Com- [1]  mandment of the Hebrew Decalogue, \"Thou  shalt have no other gods before me.\" It goes on in  perfect unity with Christ's Sermon on the Mount, and  in that age culminates in the Revelation of St. John, [5]  who, while on earth and in the flesh, like ourselves,  beheld \"a new heaven and a new earth,\"--the spiritual  universe, whereof Christian Science now bears testimony.    Our Master said, \"The works that I do shall ye do  also;\" and, \"The kingdom of God is within you.\" This [10]  makes practical all his words and works. As the ages  advance in spirituality, Christian Science will be seen  to depart from the trend of other Christian denomina-  tions in no wise except by increase of spirituality.    My first plank in the platform of Christian Science [15]  is as follows: \"There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor  substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite  manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal  Truth; matter is mortal error. Spirit is the real and  eternal; matter is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is [20]  God, and man is His image and likeness. Therefore man  is not material; he is spiritual.\"(1)    [Page 22.]    I am strictly a theist--believe in one God, one Christ [1]  or Messiah.    Science is neither a law of matter nor of man. It is  the unerring manifesto of Mind, the law of God, its  divine Principle. Who dare say that matter or [5]  mortals can evolve Science? Whence, then, is it, if not  from the divine source, and what, but the contempor-  ary of Christianity, so far in advance of human knowl-  edge that mortals must work for the discovery of even a  portion of it? Christian Science translates Mind, God, [10]  to mortals. It is the infinite calculus defining the line,  plane, space, and fourth dimension of Spirit. It abso-  lutely refutes the amalgamation, transmigration, absorp-  tion, or annihilation of individuality. It shows the  impossibility of transmitting human ills, or evil, from one [15]  individual to another; that all true thoughts revolve  in God's orbits: they come from God and return to  Him,--and untruths belong not to His creation, there-  fore these are null and void. It hath no peer, no comp-  petitor, for it dwelleth in Him besides whom \"there is [20]  none other.\"    That Christian Science is Christian, those who have  demonstrated it, according to the rules of its divine  Principle,--together with the sick, the lame, the deaf, and  the blind, healed by it,--have proven to a waiting world. [25]  He who has not tested it, is incompetent to condemn it;  and he who is a willing sinner, cannot demonstrate it.    A falling apple suggested to Newton more than the  simple fact cognized by the senses, to which it seemed  to fall by reason of its own ponderosity; but the primal [30]  cause, or Mind-force, invisible to material sense, lay  concealed in the treasure-troves of Science. True,    [Page 23.]    Newton named it gravitation, having learned so much; [1]  but Science, demanding more, pushes the question:  Whence or what is the power back of gravitation,--the  intelligence that manifests power? Is pantheism true?  Does mind \"sleep in the mineral, or dream in the [5]  animal, and wake in man\"? Christianity answers this  question. The prophets, Jesus, and the apostles, demon-  strated a divine intelligence that subordinates so-called  material laws; and disease, death, winds, and waves,  obey this intelligence. Was it Mind or matter that spake [10]  in creation, \"and it was done\"? The answer is self-  evident, and the command remains, \"Thou shalt have  no other gods before me.\"    It is plain that the Me spoken of in the First Com-  mandment, must be Mind; for matter is not the Chris- [15]  tian's God, and is not intelligent. Matter cannot even  talk; and the serpent, Satan, the first talker in its behalf,  lied. Reason and revelation declare that God is both  noumenon and phenomena,--the first and only cause.  The universe, including man, is not a result of atomic [20]  action, material force or energy; it is not organized dust.  God, Spirit, Mind, are terms synonymous for the one  God, whose reflection is creation, and man is His image  and likeness. Few there are who comprehend what Chris-  tian Science means by the word _reflection_. God is seen [25]  only in that which reflects good, Life, Truth, Love--  yea, which manifests all His attributes and power, even  as the human likeness thrown upon the mirror repeats  precisely the looks and actions of the object in front of it.  All must be Mind and Mind's ideas; since, according to [30]  natural science, God, Spirit, could not change its species  and evolve matter.    [Page 24.]    These facts enjoin the First Commandment; and [1]  knowledge of them makes man spiritually minded. St.  Paul writes: \"For to be carnally minded is death; but to  be spiritually minded is life and peace.\" This knowl-  edge came to me in an hour of great need; and I give it [5]  to you as death-bed testimony to the daystar that dawned  on the night of material sense. This knowledge is  practical, for it wrought my immediate recovery from  an injury caused by an accident, and pronounced fatal  by the physicians. On the third day thereafter, I called [10]  for my Bible, and opened it at Matthew ix. 2. As I  read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and  the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after  was in better health than I had before enjoyed. That  short experience included a glimpse of the great fact [15]  that I have since tried to make plain to others, namely,  Life in and of Spirit; this Life being the sole reality of  existence. I learned that mortal thought evolves a sub-  jective state which it names matter, thereby shutting  out the true sense of Spirit. _Per contra_, Mind and man [20]  are immortal; and knowledge gained from mortal sense  is illusion, error, the opposite of Truth; therefore it  cannot be true. A knowledge of both good and evil  (when good is God, and God is All) is impossible. Speak-  ing of the origin of evil, the Master said: \"When he [25]  speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,  and the father of it.\" God warned man not to believe  the talking serpent, or rather the allegory describing  it. The Nazarene Prophet declared that his followers  should handle serpents; that is, put down all subtle falsi- [30]  ties or illusions, and thus destroy any supposed effect  arising from false claims exercising their supposed power    [Page 25.]    on the mind and body of man against his holiness and [1]  health.    That there is but one God or Life, one cause and  one effect, is the _multum in parvo_ of Christian Science;  and to my understanding it is the heart of Christianity, [5]  the religion that Jesus taught and demonstrated. In  divine Science it is "]]]
