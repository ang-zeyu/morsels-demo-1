At the end of the folios (which were finely bound  and gilt) were great jars of china placed one above another in a very  noble piece of architecture. The quartos were separated from the octavos  by a pile of smaller vessels, which rose in a delightful pyramid. The  octavos were bounded by tea-dishes of all shapes, colors, and sizes, which  were so disposed on a wooden frame that they looked like one continued  pillar indented with the finest strokes of sculpture, and stained with the  greatest variety of dyes. That part of the library which was designed for  the reception of plays and pamphlets, and other loose papers, was inclosed  in a kind of square, consisting of one of the prettiest grotesque works  that I ever saw, and made up of scaramouches, lions, mandarins, monkeys,  trees, shells, and a thousand other odd figures in china ware. In the  midst of the room was a little Japan table with a quire of gilt paper upon  it, and on the paper a silver snuff-box made in shape of a little book. I  found there were several other counterfeit books upon the upper shelves,  which were carved in wood, and served only to fill up the number, like  fagots in the muster of a regiment. I was wonderfully pleased with such a  mixed kind of furniture as seemed very suitable both to the lady and the  scholar, and did not know at first whether I should fancy myself in a  grotto or in a library\".    If so great a favorite with the fair sex could say such satirical things  of them, I may be permitted to have my own idea of      A WOMAN'S IDEA OF A LIBRARY.      I do not care so much for books,      But Libraries are all the style,    With fine \"editions de luxe\"      One's formal callers to beguile;      With neat dwarf cases round the walls,      And china teapots on the top,    The empty shelves concealed by falls      Of India silk that graceful drop.      A few rare etchings greet the view,      Like \"Harmony\" and \"Harvest Moon;\"    An artist's proof on satin too      By what's-his-name is quite a boon.      My print called \"Jupiter and Jo\"      Is very rarely seen, but then    Another copy I can show      Inscribed with \"Jupiter and 10.\"      A fisher boy in marble stoops      On pedestal in window placed,    And one of Rogers' lovely groups      Is through the long lace curtains traced.      And then I make a painting lean      Upon a white and gilded easel,    Illustrating that famous scene      Of Joseph Andrews and Lady Teazle.      Of course my shelves the works reveal      Of Plutarch, Rollin, and of Tupper,    While Bowdler's Shakespeare and \"Lucille\"      Quite soothe one's spirits after supper.      And when I visited dear Rome      I bought a lot of photographs,    And had them mounted here at home,      And though my dreadful husband laughs,      I've put them in \"The Marble Faun,\"      And envious women vainly seek    At Scribner's shop, from early dawn,      To find a volume so unique.      And monthly here, in deep surmise,      Minerva's bust above us frowning,    A club of women analyze      The works of Ibsen and of Browning.    In the charming romance, \"Realmah,\" the noble African prince prescribes  monogamy to his subjects, but he allows himself three wives; one is a  State wife, to sit by his side on the throne, help him receive  embassadors, and preside at court dinners; another a household wife, to  rule the kitchen and the homely affairs of the palace; the third is a  love-wife, to be cherished in his heart and bear him children. Why would  it not be fair to the Book-Worm to concede him a Book-wife, who should  understand and sympathize with him in his eccentricity, and who should  care more for rare and beautiful books than for diamonds, laces, Easter  bonnets and ten-button gloves?    In regard to women's book-clubs, a recent writer, Mr. Edward Sanford  Martin, in \"Windfalls of Observation,\" observes: \"If a man wants to read a  book he buys it, and if he likes it he buys six more copies and gives (not  all the same day, of course) to six women whose intelligence he respects.  But if a club of fifteen girls determine to read a book, do they buy  fifteen copies? No. Do they buy five copies? No. Do they buy--No, they  don't buy at all; they borrow a copy. It doesn't lie in womankind to spend  money for books unless they are meant to be a gift for some man.\" Mr.  Martin is a little too hard here, for I have been told of such clubs which  sometimes bought one copy. To be sure they always bully the bookseller  into letting them have it at cost on account of the probable benefit to  his trade. But it is true that no normally organized woman will forego a  dollar's worth of ribbon or gloves for a dollar's worth of book. I have  sometimes read aloud to a number of women while they were sewing, but I do  it no more, for just as I got to a point where you ought to be able to  hear a pin drop, I always have heard some woman whisper, \"Lend me your  eighty cotton.\" A story was told me of the first meeting of a Browning  Club in a large city in Ohio. My informant was a young lady from the East,  who was present, and my readers can safely rely on the correctness of the  narration. The club was composed of young ladies from sixteen to  twenty-five years of age, all of the \"first families.\" It was thought best  to take an easy poem for the first meeting, and so one of them read aloud,  \"The Last Ride Together\". After the reading there was a moment's  silence, and then one observed that she would like to know whether they  took that ride on horseback or in a \"buggy.\" Another silence, and then an  artless young bud ventured the remark that she thought it must have been  in a buggy, because if it was on horseback he could not have got his arm  around her. I once thought of sending this anecdote to Mr. Browning, but  was warned that he was destitute of the sense of humor, especially at his  own expense, and so desisted.      \"Ah, that our wives could only see      How well the money is invested    In these old books, which seem to be      By them, alas! so much detested.\"    But the wives are not always unwise in their opposition to their husband's  book-buying. There is nothing more pitiful than to see the widow of a poor  clergyman or lawyer trying to sell his library, and to witness her  disappointment at the shrinkage of value which she had been taught and  accustomed to regard as so great. A woman who has a true and wise  sympathy with her husband's book-buying is an adored object. I recollect  one such, who at her own suggestion gave up the largest and best room in  her house to her husband's books, and received her callers and guests in a  smaller one--she also received her husband's blessing.          VIII.    THE ILLUSTRATOR.      The popular notion of the Illustrator, as the term is used by the  Book-Worm, is that he buys many valuable books containing pictures and  spoils them by tearing the pictures out, and from them constructs another  valuable book with pictures. We smile to read this in the newspapers. If  it were strictly true it would be a very reprehensible practice. But  generally the books compelled to surrender their prints to the Illustrator  are good for nothing else. To lament over them is as foolish as to grieve  over the grape-skins out of which has been pressed the luscious  Johannisburger, or to mourn over the unsightly holes which the  porcelain-potter has made in the clay-bank. Even among Book-Worms the  Illustrator, or the \"Grangerite,\" as the term of reproach is, has come in  for many hard knocks in recent years. John Hill Burton set the tune by his  merry satire in \"The Book-Hunter,\" in which he portrays the Grangerite  illustrating the pious Watts' stanzas, beginning, \"How doth the little  busy bee.\" In his first edition Mr. Burton mentioned among \"great writers  on bees,\" whose portrait would be desirable, Aristarchus, meaning probably  Aristomachus. This mistake is not corrected in the last edition, but the  name is omitted altogether.    Mr. Beverly Chew \"drops into poetry\" on the subject, and thus  apostrophises the Grangerite:          \"Ah, ruthless wight,    Think of the books you've turned to waste,        With patient skill.\"    Mr. Henri Pere Du Bois thus describes the ordinary result: \"Of one hundred  books extended by the insertion of prints which were not made for them,  ninety-nine are ruined; the hundredth book is no longer a book; it is a  museum. An imperfect book, built with the spoils of a thousand books; a  crazy quilt made of patches out of gowns of queens and scullions.\" So  Burton compares the Grangerite to Genghis Kahn. Mr. Lang declares the  Grangerites are \"book ghouls, and brood, like the obscene demons of  Arabian superstition, over the fragments of the mighty dead.\" I would like  to show Mr. Lang how I have treated his \"Letters to Dead Authors\" and \"Old  Friends\" by illustration. He would probably feel, with AEsop's lawyer, that  \"circumstances alter cases,\" although he says \"no book deserves the  honor\".    So a reviewer in \"The Nation\" stigmatises Grangerism as \"a vampire art,  maiming when it does not murder\" (I did not know that vampires \"maim\"  their victims) \"and incapable of rising beyond canibalism\" (not that they  feed on one another, but when critics get excited their metaphors are apt  to become mixed).    \"G. W. S.,\" of the New York \"Tribune,\" speaks of the achievement of the  Illustrators as \"colossal vulgarities.\" Mr. Percy Fitzgerald observes:  \"The pitiless Grangerite slaughters a book for a few pictures, just as an  epicure has had a sheep killed for the sweetbread\".    These are very choice hard words. There is much extravagance, but some  justice in all this criticism. As a question of economics I do not find  any great difference between a Book-worm who spends thousands of dollars  in constructing one attractive book from several not attractive, and one  who spends a thousand dollars in binding a book, or for an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#5)"],[1,"are they to be found now. In my own district of Cleveland they were in  1874 all but extinct. I remember as a boy two were caught in our  neighbourhood, one in Kildale and one at Ayton; but in 1874 I had three  young badgers sent me from Cornwall, dug out by one of my uncles, and  these I turned out in my father's coverts, and secured for them the  keeper's protection. Since then they have, with a few later  introductions, held their own, and a few years ago I knew of nine badger  \"sets\" in the vicinity, and some five on our own ground; but I regret  that the hands of neighbours are against them.    In Scotland the badger is now rare. In the north-eastern counties, where  till recently he was to be met with in every wild woodland and forest  district, he has entirely vanished. In Ross-shire and in the west he is  occasionally found in places where the wild cat and marten are making  their last stand against the keeper and his exterminating engine, the  steel trap. In Ireland the badger is still found in the Wild West. I  have come upon him in Connemara, near the Killery harbour, and have  heard of him in Kerry and other counties.    As to the distribution of the badger in Ireland I quote the following  interesting letters from the _Field_:--    \"'Lepus Hibernicus' may be glad to know that the badger is still fairly  common in the neighbourhood of Clonmel. The country people, who know  them better under the name of 'earth-dogs,' in distinction to  'water-dogs,' or otters, not unfrequently catch them in one way or  another, and offer them for sale. Fortunately for the badger the demand  is extremely limited.\"--Badger (Clonmel). \"Permit me to coincide with  'Lepus Hibernicus' respecting the plentifulness of the badger in  Ireland. Some years since I was on a large estate in Co. Clare, and  badgers were abundant on the domain and the adjoining property; I also  found them numerous in the wilds of Galway. I have found and killed them  in many parts of England and Wales, but have seen and trapped far more  in the west of Ireland.\"--J. J. M. \"Your correspondent, 'Lepus  Hibernicus,' in the _Field_ of November 5, mentions that badgers are by  no means uncommon in Ireland. I am in the west of Cornwall, and there  are any amount here, a great deal too plentiful to please me, as I am  sure they do a lot of harm to rabbits and game. I found the parts of a  fowl in a field, evidently killed by a badger, as there was a trail not  a foot away, and also a hole scratched, which could be the work of none  other than a badger. I had two very big ones brought to me alive last  week. They were caught by setting a noose of thin rope in their run. I  should like to know a good way to exterminate them, as, though I shoot  over a great deal of ground, I have never seen one out in daytime, but  their trail is everywhere.\"--H. J. W. \"The badger is by no means rare in  the west of Clare, where I have trapped several.\"--A. H. G. \"I beg to  inform 'Lepus Hibernicus' that badgers are by no means scarce in this  place.\"--A. R. Warren, Warren's Court, Lisarda, Cork. \"The badger in  this part of the Co. Cork is certainly not rare--Owen, Sheehy, Coosane,  and Goulacullen mountains, with the adjoining ranges, afford shelter to  a goodly number. Farm hands occasionally capture unwary ones, and offer  them for sale as pets, or to test the mettle of the national terrier, or  to be converted into bacon. A badger's ham is often seen suspended from  the rafter of a farmer's kitchen.\"--J. Wagner (Dunmanway, Co. Cork).    The counties in which I have had most acquaintance with the badger have  been Radnorshire, Yorkshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and  Cornwall, but perhaps most of my experience has been gained in the  last-named county, as far as digging for him is concerned; whilst it is  at home in Cleveland that I have watched him for nearly twenty years,  and gained some knowledge of his mode of life and habits. I am not sure  whether there are not a few still left in the Cheviots and the districts  of the Upper Tyne and Tweed. Up till about 1850 they were to be found on  the Cleveland hills, or rather on their wooded sides and in the \"gills.\"  The last place where I heard of them being hunted was in the ravine and  woods of Kilton.    A badger's earth or warren is properly and generally called a \"set\" or  \"cete.\" They vary in respect of size, number of entrances, depth of  galleries, and choice of site almost as much as rabbit-holes. Sometimes  badgers will find sufficient room in rocks to make a home, and it is  extraordinary the excavations they occasionally make in apparently solid  rock. Usually, however, they select some softer material in which to  make their underground passages and chambers. They will choose a quiet  hillside away from man's habitation, amongst the whin bushes, or in the  woods near a stream or small runner of water. Such a \"set,\" if long  established, will penetrate through earth, clay, and sub-soil, to some  stratum of shale, or sand, or loose rock. Some of the galleries and  chambers will be at a great distance from the surface, and some at an  enormous depth. When a new earth is made I have always found the badger  appropriate the holes of rabbits, and proceed to excavate, enlarge, and  open them out. This operation of opening a new earth takes place  constantly in the spring-time, great masses of material being thrown  out; but as often as not the new house is abandoned before completed,  and the subsequent labours of the family are devoted to repairing,  enlarging, and making new front or back doors to the old place. In  Cornwall I once tried my hand with my brother, some strong Cornishmen,  and a team of terriers, at a very innocent-looking badger \"set\" situated  in a level field. There were but three holes, and these not very far  apart. The farmer told us that there had been badgers there all his  life, and no one had ever been able to dig one out. This rather  stimulated us than otherwise, and we had in the course of a few hours  dug a trench some six feet deep, and were nearing the sounds of the  subterranean conflict, which had been sustained by the terriers, when  suddenly we found that we were above the sound, and we sank a shaft down  three feet from the bottom of our trench, to find galleries and chambers  in all directions. The battle had by this time moved, and we were in  despair at the prospect of following on the level with a depth of nine  feet of surface soil to be lifted in every direction we turned. I was  listening at the bottom of the trench, having penetrated to the third  storey of this underground barrack, when I distinctly heard the  \"bump-bump\" of the badger below me. My companions came down and listened  too, and there was not the slightest doubt that there was a fourth  storey and labyrinth of passages some three or four feet below us, and  for anything we knew another beyond. The day was far spent, the task was  impossible, and the rest of our time was devoted to getting the  terriers out, and making as good a retreat as we could before the  victorious enemy.    I should think this \"set\" was hundreds of years old, and some of the  passages, the farmer told us, were a hundred yards long! As a rule a  badger's hole descends rapidly at first, and then may branch into any  number of by-ways and subterranean galleries. Whichever route you  follow, however, you invariably come to a chamber or \"oven,\" which is  generally a sort of vaulted hall, where four ways meet, and which is, or  has been, the living-room of the family at some previous time. Where  there is an old-established \"set\" it is difficult to drive the badgers  permanently away from it. They may leave it for a while from fancy, or  because of disturbance, but they will certainly return.    The badger and his wife have a regular spring cleaning after the winter  is over, and about March and April a cart-load of winter bedding,  rubbish, earth, and sweepings will be thrown in a few nights outside the  front door. There is generally the old bedding left in one or two of  the big chambers for the lady who is to be brought to bed in February,  March, or April; and there is another turn-out after this interesting  event has been accomplished. About the middle of June, in July and  August, and as late as October and November, an extraordinary amount of  fresh bedding will be taken in. On summer evenings I have watched the  badgers at work, but regret that I cannot substantiate the following  description:--\"Badgers when they Earth, after by digging they have  entred a good depth, for the clearing of the Earth out, one of them  falleth on the back, and the other layeth Earth on the belly, and so  taking his hinder feet in the mouth draweth the Belly-laden Badger out  of the Hole or Cave; and having disburdened herself, re-enters and doth  the like till all be finished.\"    No, this is not how it is done, though it is a curious sight to see the  real thing. The badger will come out, take a look round, and sit awhile  close to the mouth of the hole. He will then shuffle about and get  further from the hole. You will watch him descend into some  bracken-covered hollow, and will see nothing more of him for awhile.  Then you will hear him gently pushing and shoving and grunting, and know  that he is very busy over something. He will reappear bumping along  backwards, a heap of bracken and of grass or old straw, left from a  pheasant feed, under his belly, and encircled by his arms and fore-feet.  He will continue this most undignified and curious mode of retrogression  to the earth, and will disappear tail first down his hole, still hugging  and tugging at his burden.    \"It is very pleasant to behold them when they gather materials for their  Couch, as straw, leaves, moss, and such-like; for with their Feet and  their Head they will wrap as much together as a man will carry under his  arm, and will make shift to get into their Cells "]]]
