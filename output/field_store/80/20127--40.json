The management plans developed by the National Park Service for the  Glacier Bay National Monument did not anticipate, and apparently have  not been adequate to deal with, the increased visitor and vessel  traffic and their use of the marine environment in the 1970's. Title  36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, under which the National Park  Service operates, contains a section requiring any commercial business  conducted or operating within the boundaries of Service area to have a  permit issued by the Service. The cruise ship industry companies have  not as yet been placed under a permit system. However, it is the  intent of the Service to establish a regular system in the future. All  other commercial ventures operating on lands and waters of the  Monument are under contract or permit. Fishing vessel activity is  unregulated although the take of Pacific halibut, (_Hippoglossus  stenolepis_) is regulated by the International Pacific Halibut  Commission, and the take of salmon and other finfish and shellfish is  regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG). The need  for additional resource/use plans and regulatory programs is  recognized by the National Park Service.    The NPS funded field studies of humpback whales by the Juraszs in  1976-1979, analysis of some of the Juraszs' data, and Hale's and  Rice's (of the NPS Alaska area office) report, \"The Glacier Bay Marine  Ecosystem--A Conceptual, Ecological Model\" completed in April 1979.    The movement of humpback whales in 1978 from Glacier Bay to  surrounding waters and the suggestion by the Juraszs' field  observations, that there may be a cause and effect relationship  between vessel activity and the whales' movement, led the NPS to  restrict some vessel activities in the 1979 season, and to seek  Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultations with the National  Marine Fisheries Service in August 1979. The Section 7 consultations  were not completed at the beginning of the meeting. Based in part upon  NMFS's recommendations, the NPS will consider various future  management alternatives. Restrictions imposed in 1979 were temporary  (emergency closure authority under Title 36 C.F.R.). Any regulations  imposed for 1980 cannot be under emergency closure authority (unless  an emergency does arise which was unforeseen in setting up regulatory  systems). Regulations which can be foreseen at this time as being  necessary would have to proceed through the normal Federal Register  publication process. Enforcement of all Federal laws and regulations  within Glacier Bay is considered to be the responsibility of the NPS.    The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has overall  responsibility, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, for  the conservation and protection of all whales including humpback  whales. The National Marine Fisheries Service in cooperation with the  Juraszs has conducted censuses of humpback whales in southeast Alaskan  waters in 1975 and 1976, used radio tags to follow individual whales  in Alaskan waters in 1976-78, maintains a catalogue of humpback  whale photographs and has developed a computerized retrieval  photo-identification system. No research was conducted by NMFS in  1979. NMFS enforcement of laws and regulations is conducted by a few  people responsible for large areas in southeast Alaska. A contract  with the State of Alaska until August 1, 1979, provided a broader  presence of enforcement personnel. That contract was not renewed. The  NMFS is now fully responsible for enforcement activities relating to  humpback whales except in areas such as Glacier Bay where the  responsibility is shared.        [Footnote 6: This summary is based on information presented at        the meeting by National Park Service and National Marine        Fisheries Service Personnel.]          ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS      Based on available information, vessel activity may have been a factor  contributing to the movement of whales from Glacier Bay in 1978 and  1979. Alternatives available to manage vessel traffic (assuming  increased traffic has had or will have an adverse effect on humpback  whales) include:      1. Total closure of Glacier Bay to all vessels.      2. Closure to all vessels during the whale season.      3. Closure to all vessels during part of the whale season.        4. Total closure to all but certain classes of vessels--e.g.,        cruise vessels        charter vessels        fishing vessels      5. Seasonal closure to all but certain classes of       vessels--e.g.,          cruise vessels          charter vessels          fishing vessels      6. Partial season closure to all but certain classes of       vessels--e.g.          cruise vessels          charter vessels          fishing vessels      7. Alternatives 4, 5, or 6 with limitations on total numbers of       vessels of various classes given access      8. Alternatives 4, 5, 6 or 7 with restrictions applying only to      certain areas of the Bay      9. Establishment of a ceiling for all vessels or certain classes of      vessels during all or part of the whale season     10. No restrictions on access but certain activities prohibited or       limited to certain areas or vessel classes--e.g.:  establish       traffic lanes and permit \"deliberate\" whale-watching only by a       few trained and licensed charter-boat operators.     11. No restrictions.          IDENTIFYING AND SELECTING THE MOST APPROPRIATE  RESEARCH/MANAGEMENT STRATEGY      Factors that should be considered in making research/management  decisions include (1) that the humpback whale is an endangered  species; (2) that there are statutory requirements to protect the  whales and their habitats; (3) that the cause of the present problem  is uncertain; (4) that the purpose of the Monument is to provide for  educational, recreational, and scientific experiences; and (5) that  limiting access or restricting or closing the Monument to some or all  vessel activity could affect commercial and private enterprises,  including fishing.    Additionally, there are a number of types and possible consequences of  decision errors that should also be considered--e.g.,     1. If Glacier Bay is a critical habitat, and if the movement of      humpbacks is in response to whale watching vessels, pleasure      boats, cruise vessels, etc., and if the movement is or will be      irreversible; then the humpback whale population will be adversely      impacted (e.g., carrying capacity reduced) if no action is taken.     2. If Glacier Bay is not a critical habitat, and if movement is due      to whale watching vessels, etc., and it is or will be irreversible;      then only the quality of visitor experience/value of monument is      decreased if no action is taken. The impact on the population of      humpbacks is not critical so long as suitable habitat is available      elsewhere. However, the NPS mandate established in the 1916 Act      still would not be fulfilled.     3. If all, or a specific type of, vessel traffic is prohibited or      regulated, and the movement from the Bay is not caused, directly      or indirectly by such traffic; then there will be decreased      opportunity for human activity within the Bay, and increased      economic impacts on fishermen and commercial operators that may      have been unnecessarily restricted.      The optimal short-term research/management strategy would minimize the  risks associated with the kinds of errors discussed above, and include  actions such as the following:     1) by early 1980, compile and complete the analysis and evaluation of      all existing and relevant data;     2) based upon the evaluation of the best available data, promulgate      temporary (one season) whale watching regulations and/or restrict      access by all or certain classes of vessels or the number,      frequency, or duration of visits of all or certain classes of      vessels to certain areas at certain times of the year, as may be      appropriate;     3) continue and, if appropriate expand, surveys of whale/vessel      numbers, distribution, movements, behavior and interactions in and      outside Glacier Bay;     4) identify and initiate additional research that is needed to      identify and mitigate the cause or causes of the observed humpback      whale movement from the Bay, e.g.,        a. characterize the acoustical environment of Glacier Bay and         other areas in which humpbacks occur;        b. characterize the sounds generated by various classes of vessels         and aircraft;        c. design and conduct sound playback experiments to test hypotheses         concerning the possible effects of vessel activities on humpback         whale movements and behavior; and        d. assess and monitor the physical, chemical, and biological         characteristics of Glacier Bay, especially the distribution and         abundance of prey species upon which humpback whales feed.    The optimal long-range research/management strategy would include:     1) the development and implementation of a humpback whale recovery      plan to include humpback whales in all of Glacier Bay, all of      southeast Alaska and the North Pacific in general, including: the      identification, designation and protection of critical humpback      whale"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#5)"],[1,"several days. At this place we were visited by some fifty Masai  warriors, who on the receipt of a small present danced and went away.  The water at guinea fowl camp consisted of a spring which rises from the  sandy soil and flows a few hundred yards, and then disappears into the  earth. This is the only drinking-place for several miles, so it is  frequented by large numbers and many varieties of game. At one time I  have seen hartbeest, wildbeest, grantii, mpallah, Thomson's oryx,  giraffes and rhinoceros. We supported the caravan on meat. I used only  the .450 Express; but my servant, George Galvin, who used the  Winchester, did better execution with his weapon than I with mine.    Here, for the first and last time in my African experiences, we had a  drive. Our camp was pitched on a low escarpment, at the bottom of which,  and some 300 feet away, lay the water. The escarpment ran east and west,  and extended beyond the camp some 500 yards, where it ended abruptly in  a cliff forty or fifty feet high. Some of my men, who were at the end of  the escarpment gathering wood, came running into camp and said that  great numbers of game were coming toward the water. I took my servant  and we ran to the end of the escarpment, where a sight thrilling indeed  to the sportsman met our eyes. First came two or three hundred wildbeest  in a solid mass; then four or five smaller herds, numbering perhaps  forty each, of hartbeest; then two herds, one of mpallah and one of  grantii. There must have been 500 head in the lot. They were approaching  in a slow, hesitating manner, as these antelope always do approach  water, especially when going down wind.    Our cover was perfect and the wind blowing steadily in our direction. I  decided, knowing that they were making for the water, and to reach it  must pass close under where we lay concealed, to allow a certain number  of them to pass before we opened fire. This plan worked perfectly. The  animals in front slackened pace when they came to within fifty yards of  us, and those behind pressed on and mingled with those in front. The  effect to the eye was charming. The bright tan-colored skins of the  hartbeest shone out in pleasing contrast to the dark gray wildbeest. Had  I not been so young, and filled with youth's thirst for blood, I should  have been a harmless spectator of this beautiful procession. But this  was not to be. On catching sight of the water, the animals quickened  their pace, and in a moment nearly half of the mass had passed our  hiding-place. A silent signal, and the .450 and the Winchester, fired in  quick succession, changed this peaceful scene into one of consternation  and slaughter. Startled out of their senses, the beasts at first halted  in their tracks, and then wheeling, as if at word of command, they  dashed rapidly up wind--those in the rear receiving a second volley as  they galloped by. When the dust cleared away, we saw lying on the  ground below us four animals--two hartbeest and two wildbeest. I am  afraid that many of those who escaped carried away with them proofs of  their temerity and our bad marksmanship.    Ngiri, our next camp, is a large swamp, surrounded first by masses of  tall cane and then by a beautiful though narrow strip of forest composed  of tall acacias. It was at this place, in the thick bush which stretches  from the swamp almost to the base of Kilimanjaro, that the Hon. Guy  Dawnay, an English sportsman, had met his death by the horns of a  buffalo but four months before. My tent was pitched within twenty paces  of his grave and just under a large acacia, which serves as his  monument, upon whose bark is cut in deep characters the name of the  victim and the date of his mishap.    Here we made a strong zariba of thorns, as we had heard we should meet a  large force of Masai in this neighborhood. I stopped ten days at Ngiri,  and, with the exception of one adventure hardly worth relating, had no  difficulty with the Masai. Undoubtedly I was very fortunate in finding  the large majority of the Masai warriors, inhabiting the country  through which I passed, absent from their homes. But at the same time I  venture to think that the ferocity of these people has been much  overrated, especially in regard to Europeans; for the force at my  disposal was not numerous enough to overawe them had they been evilly  disposed.    One morning, after I had been some days at Ngiri, I set out with twenty  men to procure meat for the camp. The sun had not yet risen, and I was  pursuing my way close to the belt of reeds which surrounds the swamp,  when I saw in the dim light a black object standing close to the reeds.  My men said it was a hippo, but as I drew nearer I could distinguish the  outlines of a gigantic buffalo, broadside on and facing from the swamp.  When I got to within what I afterwards found by pacing it off to be 103  paces, I raised my .577 to my shoulder, and, taking careful aim at the  brute's shoulder, fired. When the smoke cleared away there was nothing  in sight. Knowing the danger of approaching these animals when wounded,  I waited until the sun rose, and then cautiously approached the spot.  The early rays of the sun witnessed the last breathings of one of the  biggest buffaloes ever shot in Africa. Its head is now in the  Smithsonian Institute at Washington, and, according to the measurement  made by Mr. Rowland Ward, Piccadilly, London, it ranks among the first  five heads ever set up by him.    After sending the head, skin and meat back to camp, I continued my way  along the shore of the swamp. The day had begun well and I hardly hoped  for any further sport, but I was pleasantly disappointed.    Toward 11 o'clock I entered a tall acacia forest, and had not proceeded  far in it before my steps were arrested by the sight of three elephants,  lying down not 100 yards from me. They got our wind at once, and were up  and off before I could get a shot. I left all my men but one gun-bearer  on the outskirts of the forest and followed upon the trail of the  elephant. I had not gone fifteen minutes before I had traversed the  forest, and entered the thick and almost impenetrable bush beyond it.  And hardly had I forced my way a few paces into this bush, when a sight  met my eyes which made me stop and think. Sixty yards away, his head  towering above the surrounding bush, stood a monstrous tusker. His trunk  was curled over his back in the act of sprinkling dust over his  shoulders. His tusks gleamed white and beautiful. He lowered his head,  and I could but just see the outline of his skull and the tips of his  ears. This time my gun-bearer did not run. The sight of the ivory  stirred in him a feeling, which, in a Swahili, often conquers  fear--cupidity. I raised some dust in my hand and threw it in the air,  to see which way the wind blew. It was favorable. Then beckoning my  gun-bearer, I moved forward at a slight angle, so as to come opposite  the brute's shoulder. I had gone but a few steps when the bush opened  and I got a good sight of his head and shoulder. He was apparently  unconscious of our presence and was lazily flapping his ears against his  sides. Each time he did this, a cloud of dust arose, and a sound like  the tap of a bass drum broke the stillness. I fired my .577 at the outer  edge of his ear while it was lying for an instant against his side. A  crash of bush, then silence, and no elephant in sight. I began to think  that I had been successful, but the sharper senses of the negro enabled  him to know the contrary. His teeth chattered, and for a moment he was  motionless with terror. Then he pointed silently to his left. I stooped  and looked under the bush. Not twenty feet away was a sight which made  me share the feelings of my gun-bearer. The elephant was the picture of  rage; his forelegs stretched out in front of him, his trunk curled high  in the air, and his ears lying back along his neck. I seized my 8-bore  and took aim at his foreward knee, but before I could fire, he was at  us. I jumped to one side and gave him a two-ounce ball in the shoulder,  which apparently decided him on retreat. The bush was so thick that in a  moment he was out of sight. I followed him for some time, but saw no  more of him. His trail mingled with that of a large herd, which, after  remaining together for some time, apparently separated in several  directions. The day was blazing hot, and I was in the midst of a  pathless bush, far away from my twenty men.    By 2 P. M., I had come up with them again and turned my face toward  camp. On the way thither, I killed two zebras, a waterbuck and a  Thomsonii. By the time the meat was cut up and packed on my men's heads  the sun had set. The moon was magnificently bright and served to light  our road. For one mile our way led across a perfectly level plain. This  plain was covered with a kind of salt as white as snow, and with the  bright moon every object was as easily distinguished as by day. The  fresh meat proved an awkward load for my men, and we frequently were  forced to stop while one or the other re-arranged the mass he carried.  They were very cheery about it, however, and kept shouting to one  another how much they would enjoy the morrow's feast. Their shouts were  answered by the mocking wails of many hyenas, who hovered on our flanks  and rear like a pursuing enemy. I shot two of these beasts, which kept  their friends busy for a while, and enabled us to pursue our way in  peace.    This white plain reaches nearly to the shores of Ngiri Swamp on the  north, and to the east it is bounded by a wall of densely thick bush. We  had approached to within 400 yards of the point where the line of bush  joins the swamp, when I noticed a small herd of wildbeest walking slowly  toward us, coming from the edge of the swamp. A few moments later, a cry  escaped from my gun-bearer, who grasped my arm and whispered eagerly,  _simba_. This means lion. He pointed to the"]]]
