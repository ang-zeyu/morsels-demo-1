When the _Times_ thought that Oxford was left to the  scholars, because \"thanes and barons\" did not think it worth struggling  for, the _Times_ clearly did not know that schools grew up at Oxford  then, just as schools have grown up at Manchester since, because  Oxford was already, according to the standard of the time, a great,  flourishing, and central town, and therefore fittingly chosen as a seat  of councils and parliaments. Here there is real error to fight against;  in other cases there is simply a kind of pleasure in pointing out that,  while the received object of attraction in a place is often perfectly  worthy of its fame, the place contains other, and often older, objects  which are worthy of some measure of fame also. It is quite possible  that some people may think that the town of Assisi grew up round the  church and monastery of Saint Francis. If anyone does think so, the  error is of exactly the same kind as the error of thinking that the  city of Oxford grew up around the University. It is Saint Francis  and his church which have made Assisi a place of world-wide fame and  world-wide pilgrimage, and Saint Francis and his church are fully  worthy of their fame. Yet Assisi had been a city of men for ages on  ages before Saint Francis was born, and Assisi would still be a place  well worthy of a visit, though Saint Francis had never been born, and  though his church had therefore never been built. It is perhaps a light  matter that Assisi had eminent citizens besides Saint Francis and very  unlike Saint Francis, that it was the birthplace of Propertius before  him and of Metastasio after him. But before Assisi, as the birthplace  of the seraphic doctor, had earned a right to be itself called  \"seraphica civitas,\" before one of its later churches came to rank with  the patriarchal basilicas of Rome, Assisi had, as a Roman and an early  mediaeval city, covered its soil with monuments of which not a few still  exist and which are well worthy of study. And in one way they have a  kind of connexion with Saint Francis which his own church has not. The  saint never saw his own monument; it would have vexed his soul could  he have known that such a monument was to be. But in his youth he saw,  and doubtless mused, as on the bleak mountain of Subasio and the yellow  stream of Chiaschio, so also on the campanile and apse of the cathedral  church of St. Rufino and on the columns of the converted temple of the  Great Twin Brethren.    Assisi is one of the hill-cities; but the hill-cities supply endless  varieties among themselves. Assisi does not, like the others which  we have spoken of, occupy a hill which is wholly its own; the hill on  which it stands, though very distinct, is still only a spur of a huge  mountain. As at Mykene, while the akropolis is high enough, there is  something far higher rising immediately above it. And the akropolis  of Assisi is a mere fortress; even if it was the primitive place of  shelter, it cannot have been inhabited for many ages. The _duomo_  stands, very far certainly from the top of the hill, but at the top  of the really inhabited city with its continuous streets, and that is  no small height from the lowest line of them. Above the church are the  remains of the theatre, of the amphitheatre; the distant tower beyond  it, and soaring over all, the fortress of Rocco Grande with no dwelling  of man near it, or for some way below it. To go behind Assisi is almost  more needful than in the case of any of the other hill-cities, not  only for the mediaeval walls, for the slight traces which seem to mark  an outer and earlier wall; but yet more for the view over the narrow  valley, the bleak hills scattered with houses, the winding river at  their feet, soon to become yet more winding in the plain, and the  glimpse far away of Perugia on its hill. But Assisi has a spot only  less wild within the city walls, the ground namely over which we climb  from the inhabited streets to the fortress. So it is at Cortona; but  there the presence of the church and monastery of St. Margaret makes  all the difference. The general view of Assisi, as seen from below,  gives us the church of Saint Francis with the great arched substructure  to the left, the mountain to the right; between them is a hill with a  city running along it at about half its height, sending up a forest of  bell-towers, some really good in themselves, all joining in the general  effect. Above all this is the hill-top, partly grassy, partly rocky,  crowned by the towers of the fortress which looks down on all, except  the steep of the mountain itself.    Of particular objects older than the church of Saint Francis, a  restriction which of course also cuts out the church of his friend,  Saint Clara, there can be no doubt that the monument of greatest  interest is the temple in the forum--now _Piazza grande_--with its  Corinthian columns strangely hemmed in by a house on one side and on  the other by the bell-tower which was added when the temple was turned  into a church. But it is surely not, as it is locally called, a temple  of Minerva, but rather of Castor and Pollux. Not the least interesting  part of its belongings lies below ground; for the level of the forum at  Assisi has risen as though it had been at Rome or at Trier. The temple  must have risen on a bold flight of steps, of which some of the upper  ones still remain. In front of it, below the steps, was a great altar,  with the drains for the blood of the victims, just as we see them on  the Athenian akropolis. Such drains always bring to our mind those  comments of Dean Stanley on this repulsive feature of pagan and ancient  Jewish worship, which has passed away alike from the church, from the  synagogue, and from the mosque, save only at Mecca. In front again is  the dedicatory inscription with the name of the founder of the temple,  and the record of the dedication-feast which he made to the magistrates  and people. His name can doubtless be turned to in Mommsen's great  collection; we are not sure that in the underground gloom we took it  down quite correctly, and it is better not to be wrong. Anyhow the  dedication is not to Minerva but to the twin heroes. A great number  of inscriptions are built up in the wall of the church. As usual,  there are more freedmen than sons; and among the freedmen the one best  worth notice is Publius Decimius Eros Merula, physician, surgeon, and  oculist, who bought his freedom for so much, his magistracy as one of  the _Sexviri_ for so much, who spent so much on mending the roads,  and left so much behind him. Here the state of things is vividly  brought home to us in which a man could buy, not only his cook and his  coachman, but also his architect and his medical adviser. And we are  set thinking on the one hand how great must be the physical infusion of  foreign blood, Greek and barbarian, in the actual people of Italy, and  on the other hand how thoroughly and speedily all such foreign elements  were practically Romanized. The son of the slave-born magistrate of  Assisi would look on himself, and be looked on by others, as no less  good a Roman than any Fabius or Cornelius who might still linger on.    The temple above ground and its appurtenances underground are the most  memorable things in Prae-Franciscan Assisi; but there are other things  besides, both Roman and mediaeval. The lower church of _Sta. Maria  Maggiore_, close by the bishop's palace, and which is said to have been  the original cathedral, is a Romanesque building of rather a German  look, with masses of wall instead of columns. The thought comes into  the mind that it is the _cella_ of a temple with arches cut through  its walls. But it hardly can be; the arrangement seems to be a local  fashion; it is found also in the later and larger church of St. Peter  hard by. Besides, at _Sta. Maria Maggiore_ there are the clear remains  of a Roman building, seemingly a house, with columns and mosaic floors,  underneath the present church of St. Rufino. The later cathedral has  been sadly disfigured within; but it keeps its apse of the twelfth  century, its west front of the thirteenth, using up older sculptures,  and it has the best bell-tower in Assisi. And below it remains the  crypt of the older church of 1028, with ancient Ionic columns used up,  and Corinthian capitals imitated as they might be in 1028. Just above  are scanty remains of the theatre; above again are still scantier  remains of the amphitheatre; but its shape is impressed on the  surrounding buildings, just as the four arms of the Roman _chester_  abide unchanged in many an English town where every actual house is  modern. A piece of Roman wall, and a wide arch in the _Via San Paolo_  leading out of the forum, complete the remains of ancient Assisi above  ground. It is doubtless altogether against rule, but among so many  memorials of earlier gods and earlier saints, it is quite possible, in  climbing the steep and narrow streets of Assisi, to forget for a while  both Saint Francis and Saint Clara.          Spello.      The Umbrian town which takes care to blazon over one of its many  gates its full description as \"Ispello Colonia Giulia, Citta Flavia  Costante,\" is hardly of any great fame, either as ancient Hispellum  or as modern Spello. It must have some visitors, drawn thither most  likely by two or three pictures by famous masters which remain in  one of its churches. Somebody must come to see them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#5)"],[1,"of Christian views (RELIGIO-PHILOSOPHICAL JOURNAL,  August 23). In this laudatory notice it is recorded that Ballou was the  spiritual director of a parish, that he delivered from eight to nine  thousand sermons, married one thousand couples, and wrote about five  hundred articles; but there is not a single word said of the object to  which he devoted his life; even the word \"non-resistance\" is not  mentioned. Precisely as it was with all the preaching of the Quakers for  two hundred years and, too, with the efforts of Garrison the father, the  foundation of his society and journal, and his Declaration, so it is  with the life-work of Ballou. It seems just as though it did not exist  and never had existed.    We have an astounding example of the obscurity of works which aim  at expounding the doctrine of non-resistance to evil by force, and  at confuting those who do not recognize this commandment, in the  book of the Tsech Helchitsky, which has only lately been noticed  and has not hitherto been printed.    Soon after the appearance of my book in German, I received a  letter from Prague, from a professor of the university there,  informing me of the existence of a work, never yet printed, by  Helchitsky, a Tsech of the fifteenth century, entitled \"The Net of  Faith.\"  In this work, the professor told me, Helchitsky expressed  precisely the same view as to true and false Christianity as I had  expressed in my book \"What I Believe.\"  The professor wrote to me  that Helchitsky's work was to be published for the first time in  the Tsech language in the JOURNAL OF THE PETERSBURG ACADEMY OF  SILENCE.  Since I could not obtain the book itself, I tried to  make myself acquainted with what was known of Helchitsky, and I  gained the following information from a German book sent me by the  Prague professor and from Pypin's history of Tsech literature.  This was Pypin's account:       \"'The Net of Faith' is Christ's teaching, which ought to draw     man up out of the dark depths of the sea of worldliness and his     own iniquity.  True faith consists in believing God's Word; but     now a time has come when men mistake the true faith for heresy,     and therefore it is for the reason to point out what the true     faith consists in, if anyone does not know this.  It is hidden     in darkness from men, and they do not recognize the true law of     Christ.       \"To make this law plain, Helchitsky points to the primitive     organization of Christian society--the organization which, he     says, is now regarded in the Roman Church as an abominable     heresy. This Primitive Church was his special ideal of social     organization, founded on equality, liberty, and fraternity.     Christianity, in Helchitsky's view, still preserves these     elements, and it is only necessary for society to return to its     pure doctrine to render unnecessary every other form of social     order in which kings and popes are essential; the law of love     would alone be sufficient in every case.       \"Historically, Helchitsky attributes the degeneration of     Christianity to the times of Constantine the Great, whom he     Pope Sylvester admitted into the Christian Church with all his     heathen morals and life.  Constantine, in his turn, endowed the     Pope with worldly riches and power.  From that time forward     these two ruling powers were constantly aiding one another to     strive for nothing but outward glory.  Divines and     ecclesiastical dignitaries began to concern themselves only     about subduing the whole world to their authority, incited men     against one another to murder and plunder, and in creed and     life reduced Christianity to a nullity. Helchitsky denies     completely the right to make war and to inflict the punishment     of death; every soldier, even the 'knight,' is only a violent     evil doer--a murderer.\"    The same account is given by the German book, with the addition of  a few biographical details and some extracts from Helchitsky's  writings.    Having learnt the drift of Helchitsky's teaching in this way, I  awaited all the more impatiently the appearance of \"The Net of  Faith\" in the journal of the Academy.  But one year passed, then  two and three, and still the book did not appear.  It was only in 1888  that I learned that the printing of the book, which had been  begun, was stopped.  I obtained the proofs of what had been  printed and read them through.  It is a marvelous book from every  point of view.    Its general tenor is given with perfect accuracy by Pypin.  Helchitsky's fundamental idea is that Christianity, by allying  itself with temporal power in the days of Constantine, and by  continuing to develop in such conditions, has become completely  distorted, and has ceased to be Christian altogether.  Helchitsky  gave the title \"The Net of Faith\" to his book, taking as his motto  the verse of the Gospel about the calling of the disciples to be  fishers of men; and, developing this metaphor, he says:       \"Christ, by means of his disciples, would have caught all the     world in his net of faith, but the greater fishes broke the net     and escaped out of it, and all the rest have slipped through     the holes made by the greater fishes, so that the net has     remained quite empty.  The greater fishes who broke the net are     the rulers, emperors, popes, kings, who have not renounced     power, and instead of true Christianity have put on what is     simply a mask of it.\"    Helchitsky teaches precisely what has been and is taught in these  days by the non-resistant Mennonites and Quakers, and in former  tunes by the Bogomilites, Paulicians, and many others.  He teaches  that Christianity, expecting from its adherents gentleness,  meekness, peaceableness, forgiveness of injuries, turning the  other cheek when one is struck, and love for enemies, is  inconsistent with the use of force, which is an indispensable  condition of authority.    The Christian, according to Helchitsky's reasoning, not only  cannot be a ruler or a soldier; he cannot take any part in  government nor in trade, or even be a landowner; he can only be an  artisan or a husbandman.    This book is one of the few works attacking official Christianity  which has escaped being burned.  All such so-called heretical  works were burned at the stake, together with their authors, so  that there are few ancient works exposing the errors of official  Christianity.  The book has a special interest for this reason  alone.  But apart from its interest from every point of view, it  is one of the most remarkable products of thought for its depth of  aim, for the astounding strength and beauty of the national  language in which it is written, and for its antiquity. And yet  for more than four centuries it has remained unprinted, and is  still unknown, except to a few learned specialists.    One would have thought that all such works, whether of the  Quakers, of Garrison, of Ballou, or of Helchitsky, asserting and  proving as they do, on the principles of the Gospel, that our  modern world takes a false view of Christ's teaching, would have  awakened interest, excitement, talk, and discussion among  spiritual teachers and their flocks alike.    Works of this kind, dealing with the very essence of Christian  doctrine, ought, one would have thought, to have been examined and  accepted as true, or refuted and rejected.  But nothing of the  kind has occurred, and the same fate has been repeated with all  those works.  Men of the most diverse views, believers, and, what  is surprising, unbelieving liberals also, as though by agreement,  all preserve the same persistent silence about them, and all that  has been done by people to explain the true meaning of Christ's  doctrine remains either ignored or forgotten.    But it is still more astonishing that two other books, of  which I heard on the appearance of my book, should be so little  known, I mean Dymond's book \"On War,\" published for the first time  in London in 1824, and Daniel Musser's book on \"Non-resistance,\"  written in 1864.  It is particularly astonishing that these books  should be unknown, because, apart from their intrinsic merits,  both books treat not so much of the theory as of the practical  application of the theory to life, of the attitude of Christianity  to military service, which is especially important and interesting  now in these clays of universal conscription.    People will ask, perhaps: How ought a subject to behave who  believes that war is inconsistent with his religion while the  government demands from him that he should enter military service?    This question is, I think, a most vital one, and the answer to it  is specially important in these days of universal conscription.  All--or at least the great majority of the people--are Christians,  and all men are called upon for military service.  How ought a  man, as a Christian, to meet this demand?  This is the gist of  Dymond's answer:       \"His duty is humbly but steadfastly to refuse to serve.\"    There are some people, who, without any definite reasoning about  it, conclude straightway that the responsibility of government  measures rests entirely on those who resolve on them, or that the  governments and sovereigns decide the question of what is good or  bad for their subjects, and the duty of the subjects is merely to  obey. I think that arguments of this kind only obscure men's  conscience.  I cannot take part in the councils of government, and  therefore I am not responsible for its misdeeds..  Indeed, but we  are responsible for our own misdeeds.  And the misdeeds of our  rulers become our own, if we, knowing that they are misdeeds,  assist in carrying, them out.  Those who suppose that they are  bound to obey the government, and that the responsibility for the  misdeeds they commit is transferred from them to their rulers,  deceive themselves.  They say:  \"We give our acts up to the will"]]]
