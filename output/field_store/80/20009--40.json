Then we had to find the rule and the string again, and a new hole was  made; and, about midnight, the picture would be up--very crooked and  insecure, the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed  down with a rake, and everybody dead beat and wretched--except Uncle  Podger.    \"There you are,\" he would say, stepping heavily off the chair on to the  charwoman's corns, and surveying the mess he had made with evident pride.  \"Why, some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like  that!\"    Harris will be just that sort of man when he grows up, I know, and I told  him so.  I said I could not permit him to take so much labour upon  himself.  I said:    \"No; _you_ get the paper, and the pencil, and the catalogue, and George  write down, and I'll do the work.\"    The first list we made out had to be discarded.  It was clear that the  upper reaches of the Thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat  sufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable;  so we tore the list up, and looked at one another!    George said:    \"You know we are on a wrong track altogether.  We must not think of the  things we could do with, but only of the things that we can't do  without.\"    George comes out really quite sensible at times.  You'd be surprised.  I  call that downright wisdom, not merely as regards the present case, but  with reference to our trip up the river of life, generally.  How many  people, on that voyage, load up the boat till it is ever in danger of  swamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the  pleasure and comfort of the trip, but which are really only useless  lumber.    How they pile the poor little craft mast-high with fine clothes and big  houses; with useless servants, and a host of swell friends that do not  care twopence for them, and that they do not care three ha'pence for;  with expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys, with formalities and  fashions, with pretence and ostentation, and with--oh, heaviest, maddest  lumber of all!--the dread of what will my neighbour think, with luxuries  that only cloy, with pleasures that bore, with empty show that, like the  criminal's iron crown of yore, makes to bleed and swoon the aching head  that wears it!    It is lumber, man--all lumber!  Throw it overboard.  It makes the boat so  heavy to pull, you nearly faint at the oars.  It makes it so cumbersome  and dangerous to manage, you never know a moment's freedom from anxiety  and care, never gain a moment's rest for dreamy laziness--no time to  watch the windy shadows skimming lightly o'er the shallows, or the  glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, or the great  trees by the margin looking down at their own image, or the woods all  green and golden, or the lilies white and yellow, or the sombre-waving  rushes, or the sedges, or the orchis, or the blue forget-me-nots.    Throw the lumber over, man!  Let your boat of life be light, packed with  only what you need--a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two  friends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a cat,  a dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little  more than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.    You will find the boat easier to pull then, and it will not be so liable  to upset, and it will not matter so much if it does upset; good, plain  merchandise will stand water.  You will have time to think as well as to  work.  Time to drink in life's sunshine--time to listen to the AEolian  music that the wind of God draws from the human heart-strings around  us--time to--    I beg your pardon, really.  I quite forgot.    Well, we left the list to George, and he began it.    [Picture: Tent] \"We won't take a tent,\" suggested George; \"we will have a  boat with a cover.  It is ever so much simpler, and more comfortable.\"    It seemed a good thought, and we adopted it.  I do not know whether you  have ever seen the thing I mean.  You fix iron hoops up over the boat,  and stretch a huge canvas over them, and fasten it down all round, from  stem to stern, and it converts the boat into a sort of little house, and  it is beautifully cosy, though a trifle stuffy; but there, everything has  its drawbacks, as the man said when his mother-in-law died, and they came  down upon him for the funeral expenses.    George said that in that case we must take a rug each, a lamp, some soap,  a brush and comb (between us), a toothbrush (each), a basin, some  tooth-powder, some shaving tackle (sounds like a French exercise, doesn't  it?), and a couple of big-towels for bathing.  I notice that people  always make gigantic arrangements for bathing when they are going  anywhere near the water, but that they don't bathe much when they are  there.    [Picture: Sea-side scene] It is the same when you go to the sea-side.  I  always determine--when thinking over the matter in London--that I'll get  up early every morning, and go and have a dip before breakfast, and I  religiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel.  I always get red  bathing drawers.  I rather fancy myself in red drawers.  They suit my  complexion so.  But when I get to the sea I don't feel somehow that I  want that early morning bathe nearly so much as I did when I was in town.    On the contrary, I feel more that I want to stop in bed till the last  moment, and then come down and have my breakfast.  Once or twice virtue  has triumphed, and I have got out at six and half-dressed myself, and  have taken my drawers and towel, and stumbled dismally off.  But I  haven't enjoyed it.  They seem to keep a specially cutting east wind,  waiting for me, when I go to bathe in the early morning; and they pick  out all the three-cornered stones, and put them on the top, and they  sharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that  I can't see them, and they take the sea and put it two miles out, so that  I have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop, shivering, through six  inches of water.  And when I do get to the sea, it is rough and quite  insulting.    One huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture, as hard  as ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me.  And,  before I've said \"Oh! Ugh!\" and found out what has gone, the wave comes  back and carries me out to mid-ocean.  I begin to strike out frantically  for the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again, and  wish I'd been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a boy, I  mean).  Just when I have given up all hope, a wave retires and leaves me  sprawling like a star-fish on the sand, and I get up and look back and  find that I've been swimming for my life in two feet of water.  I hop  back and dress, and crawl home, where I have to pretend I liked it.    In the present instance, we all talked as if we were going to have a long  swim every morning.    George said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh  morning, and plunge into the limpid river.  Harris said there was nothing  like a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite.  He said it always  gave him an appetite.  George said that if it was going to make Harris  eat more than Harris ordinarily ate, then he should protest against  Harris having a bath at all.    He said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food  for Harris up against stream, as it was.    I urged upon George, however, how much pleasanter it would be to have  Harris clean and fresh about the boat, even if we did have to take a few  more hundredweight of provisions; and he got to see it in my light, and  withdrew his opposition to Harris's bath.    Agreed, finally, that we should take _three_ bath towels, so as not to  keep each other waiting.    For clothes, George said two suits of flannel would be sufficient, as we  could wash them ourselves, in the river, when they got dirty.  We asked  him if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river, and he replied:  \"No, not exactly himself like; but he knew some fellows who had, and it  was easy enough;\" and Harris and I were weak enough to fancy he knew what  he was talking about, and that three respectable young men, without  position or influence, and with no experience in washing, could really  clean their own shirts and trousers in the river Thames with a bit of  soap.    We were to learn in the days to come, when it was too late, that George  was a miserable impostor, who could evidently have known nothing whatever  about the matter.  If you had seen these clothes after--but, as the  shilling shockers say, we anticipate.    George impressed upon us to take a change of under-things and plenty of  socks, in case we got upset and wanted a change; also plenty of  handkerchiefs, as they would do to wipe things, and a pair of leather  boots as well as our boating shoes, as we should want them if we got  upset.

Then we discussed the food question.

[Footnote u: _circ. A.D._ 1130.]    [Footnote w: _LL. Wisigoth._ 2. 1. 9.]    [Footnote x: _Capitular. Hludov. Pii._ 4. 102.]    [Footnote y: Selden _in Fletam._ 5. 5.]    [Footnote z: Domat's treatise of laws. c. 13. Sec. 9. _Epistol.  Innocent. IV. in M. Paris. ad A.D._ 1254.]    NOR was it long before the prevailing mode of the times reached  England. For Theobald, a Norman abbot, being elected to the see of  Canterbury[a], and extremely addicted to this new study, brought over  with him in his retinue many learned proficients therein; and among  the rest Roger sirnamed Vacarius, whom he placed in the university of  Oxford[b], to teach it to the people of this country. But it did not  meet with the same easy reception in England, where a mild and  rational system of laws had been long established, as it did upon the  continent; and, though the monkish clergy (devoted to the will of a  foreign primate) received it with eagerness and zeal, yet the laity  who were more interested to preserve the old constitution, and had  already severely felt the effect of many Norman innovations, continued  wedded to the use of the common law. King Stephen immediately  published a proclamation[c], forbidding the study of the laws, then  newly imported from Italy; which was treated by the monks[d] as a  piece of impiety, and, though it might prevent the introduction of the  civil law process into our courts of justice, yet did not hinder the  clergy from reading and teaching it in their own schools and  monasteries.    [Footnote a: _A.D._ 1138.]    [Footnote b: Gervas. Dorobern. _Act. Pontif. Cantuar. col._ 1665.]    [Footnote c: Rog. Bacon. _citat. per_ Selden. _in Fletam._ 7. 6. _in  Fortesc._ _c._ 33. & 8 Rep. Pref.]    [Footnote d: Joan. Sarisburiens. _Polycrat._ 8. 22.]    FROM this time the nation seems to have been divided into two parties;  the bishops and clergy, many of them foreigners, who applied  themselves wholly to the study of the civil and canon laws, which now  came to be inseparably interwoven with each other; and the nobility  and laity, who adhered with equal pertinacity to the old common law;  both of them reciprocally jealous of what they were unacquainted with,  and neither of them perhaps allowing the opposite system that real  merit which is abundantly to be found in each. This appears on the one  hand from the spleen with which the monastic writers[e] speak of our  municipal laws upon all occasions; and, on the other, from the firm  temper which the nobility shewed at the famous parliament of Merton;  when the prelates endeavoured to procure an act, to declare all  bastards legitimate in case the parents intermarried at any time  afterwards; alleging this only reason, because holy church (that is,  the canon law) declared such children legitimate: but \"all the earls  and barons (says the parliament roll[f]) with one voice answered, that  they would not change the laws of England, which had hitherto been  used and approved.\" And we find the same jealousy prevailing above a  century afterwards[g], when the nobility declared with a kind of  prophetic spirit, \"that the realm of England hath never been unto this  hour, neither by the consent of our lord the king and the lords of  parliament shall it ever be, ruled or governed by the civil law[h].\"  And of this temper between the clergy and laity many more instances  might be given.    [Footnote e: _Idem, ibid._ 5. 16. Polydor. Vergil. _Hist._ _l._ 9.]    [Footnote f: _Stat. Merton._ 20 _Hen. III._ _c._ 9. _Et omnes comites  & barones una voce responderunt, quod nolunt leges Angliae mutare,  quae hucusque usitatae sunt & approbatae._]    [Footnote g: 11 Ric. II.]    [Footnote h: Selden. _Jan. Anglor._ _l._ 2. Sec. 43. _in Fortesc._ _c._  33.]    WHILE things were in this situation, the clergy, finding it impossible  to root out the municipal law, began to withdraw themselves by degrees  from the temporal courts; and to that end, very early in the reign of  king Henry the third, episcopal constitutions were published[i],  forbidding all ecclesiastics to appear as advocates _in foro  saeculari_; nor did they long continue to act as judges there, nor  caring to take the oath of office which was then found necessary to be  administred, that they should in all things determine according to the  law and custom of this realm[k]; though they still kept possession of  the high office of chancellor, an office then of little juridical  power; and afterwards, as it's business increased by degrees, they  modelled the process of the court at their own discretion.    [Footnote i: Spelman. _Concil. A.D._ 1217. Wilkins, _vol._ 1. _p._  574, 599.]    [Footnote k: Selden. _in Fletam._ 9. 3.]    BUT wherever they retired, and wherever their authority extended, they  carried with them the same zeal to introduce the rules of the civil,  in exclusion of the municipal law. This appears in a particular manner  from the spiritual courts of all denominations, from the chancellor's  courts in both our universities, and from the high court of chancery  before-mentioned; in all of which the proceedings are to this day in a  course much conformed to the civil law: for which no tolerable reason  can be assigned, unless that these courts were all under the immediate  direction of the popish ecclesiastics, among whom it was a point of  religion to exclude the municipal law; pope Innocent the fourth  having[l] forbidden the very reading of it by the clergy, because it's  decisions were not founded on the imperial constitutions, but merely  on the customs of the laity. And if it be considered, that our  universities began about that period to receive their present form of  scholastic discipline; that they were then, and continued to be till  the time of the reformation, entirely under the influence of the  popish clergy; (sir John Mason the first protestant, being also the  first lay, chancellor of Oxford) this will lead us to perceive the  reason, why the study of the Roman laws was in those days of  bigotry[m] pursued with such alacrity in these seats of learning; and  why the common law was entirely despised, and esteemed little better  than heretical.    [Footnote l: M. Paris _ad A.D._ 1254.]    [Footnote m: There cannot be a stronger instance of the absurd and  superstitious veneration that was paid to these laws, than that the  most learned writers of the times thought they could not form a  perfect character, even of the blessed virgin, without making her a  civilian and a canonist. Which Albertus Magnus, the renowned dominican  doctor of the thirteenth century, thus proves in his _Summa de  laudibus christiferae virginis (divinum magis quam humanum opus)_  _qu._ 23. Sec. 5. \"_Item quod jura civilia, & leges, & decreta scivit in  summo, probatur hoc modo: sapientia advocati manifestatur in tribus;  unum, quod obtineat omnia contra judicem justum & sapientem; secundo,  quod contra adversarium astutum & sagacem; tertio, quod in causa  desperata: sed beatissima virgo, contra judicem sapientissimum,  Dominum; contra adversarium callidissimum, dyabolum; in causa nostra  desperata; sententiam optatam obtinuit._\" To which an eminent  franciscan, two centuries afterwards, Bernardinus de Busti (_Mariale_,  _part._ 4. _serm._ 9.) very gravely subjoins this note. \"_Nec videtur  incongruum mulieres habere peritiam juris. Legitur enim de uxore  Joannis Andreae glossatoris, quod tantam peritiam in utroque jure  habuit, ut publice in scholis legere ausa sit._\"]    AND, since the reformation, many causes have conspired to prevent it's  becoming a part of academical education. As, first, long usage and  established custom; which, as in every thing else, so especially in  the forms of scholastic exercise, have justly great weight and  authority. Secondly, the real intrinsic merit of the civil law,  considered upon the footing of reason and not of obligation, which was  well known to the instructors of our youth; and their total ignorance  of the merit of the common law, though it's equal at least, and  perhaps an improvement on the other. But the principal reason of all,  that has hindered the introduction of this branch of learning, is,  that the study of the common law, being banished from hence in the  times of popery, has fallen into a quite different chanel, and has  hitherto been wholly cultivated in another place. But as this long  usage and established custom, of ignorance in the laws of the land,  begin now to be thought unreasonable; and as by this means the merit  of those laws will probably be more generally known; we may hope that  the method of studying them will soon revert to it's antient course,  and the foundations at least of that science will be laid in the two  universities; without being exclusively confined to the chanel which  it fell into at the times I have been just describing.    FOR, being then entirely abandoned by the clergy, a few stragglers  excepted, the study and practice of it devolved of course into the  hands of laymen; who entertained upon their parts a most hearty  aversion to the civil law[n], and made no scruple to profess their  contempt, nay even their ignorance[o] of it, in the most public  manner. But still, as the ballance of learning was greatly on the side  of the clergy, and as the common law was no longer _taught_, as  formerly, in any part of the kingdom, it must have been subjected to  many inconveniences, and perhaps would have been gradually lost and  overrun by the civil, (a suspicion well justified from the frequent  transcripts of Justinian to be met with in Bracton and Fleta) had it  not"]]]
