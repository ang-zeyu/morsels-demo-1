The new phenomenon will be       about a hundred and fifty feet long, as less water line will       not admit of the speed contracted for. A bonus of $500, it is       rumored, will be paid for each additional one half-knot speed       over the contract requirements of 35 knots. The engines that       will effect this speed will be of a new and untried pattern.       They will not be exhibited unless the vessel prove a success.       The owner of this phenomenal craft, which will be the fastest       in the world, is unknown. It is suspected that it will go to       the Swedish government for use as a torpedo boat. The yacht       will be finished in five months, and her name is undecided. We       should respectfully suggest 'Sheet Lightning.'_\"    At this time Colonel Oddminton and his son began to travel restlessly.  They kept it up all winter until the first of May. The lad had developed  as much aptness for the land as he had for the water. There were two  things the boy did admirably, and for which he was conspicuous beyond  his years. He held his tongue and obeyed his father; moreover, he was  clever enough to take care of himself.    With the first of May the ceaseless journeying came to an end, and  Rupert Oddminton was sent to Washington to put his father's old schooner  in readiness for future orders.    The press, which had volunteered during the winter much plausible but  little real information about the wonderful new Herreshoff model, now  blazed into the rare glory of fact.         \"_The first trial trip of the unknown took place yesterday. The       marvellous witch astonished spectators by showing up to the       tune of 35-1/2 knots, and it is suspected the end was not       reached. This unparalleled speed was continued for 125 minutes       in favorable weather. This proved the most successful trial       trip the Herreshoffs ever held. Thus the singular and hitherto       undivulged electric machinery proves a triumphal hit. After a       few minor changes the unnamed yacht will be ready for its       destination. Who will own the fastest ship in the world? It is       conceded that she goes to Sweden. Her crew, which is entirely       composed of Swedes, is strangely uncommunicative----_\" and so       on.           *       *       *       *       *    One fine day, the magic craft shot out of Newport harbor and vanished.  Some said she went straight to Europe. Each daily had its own theory.  The boat and her evanescence were a nine days' wonder. The yacht that  represented the most exhaustive skill man had ever applied to navigation  had melted away, unnamed, unlicensed, and without destination. Even her  builder knew her no more.    The reader knows, as well as we, that this triumph of speed was Colonel  Oddminton's venture. He had literally sunk his all in it with maniacal  satisfaction, and had only a few thousands left, barely enough to pay  expenses for three months. He had pursued his ideal until he had her  under foot. He had not touched the new yacht until after it had left the  world in wonder. He had now met her on the high seas in his old  schooner, and the four--himself, his boy Rupert and the two black  sailors--with sad eyes, scuttled the home of many years. When the  Colonel's foot touched his new, bright deck, Captain Christian nodded,  and the blue flag to starboard of the mainmast (signifying owner absent)  was hauled down. The crew beheld their master for the first time. Not a  sail was in sight. The Colonel was dazed. He went below, gulped down a  pint of whiskey, and tried to think. He was intoxicated--not on liquor,  but on final possession. When he came aloft, spray was whistling from  stem to stern, and behind was a wake that overtopped the racer itself.  Water rushed as though projected through a pipe, past the shining sides  of the vessel. Colonel Oddminton, in a trance, leaned over and touched  the steel plates carefully. He expected to feel the heat generated by  the tremendous friction. Captain Hans Christian stood respectfully at  his side.    \"What speed does she register, Captain?\" asked the owner, with a  tremulousness new to the man.    \"Only thirty-two knots, sir, in this chop, but we can drive her  thirty-eight. I think she can go forty on the hardest push.\"    Only the owner of Nancy Hanks, the fastest racing horse the world has  yet produced, can imagine the sensations of the Colonel at this answer.    \"What is the speed of the fastest government boat?\" he asked with  deliberation.    \"Twenty-six knots, sir,\" was the quick reply; \"they've only two torpedo  boats that go that; and they are always up for repairs. As for war-ships  or cruisers, none average over twenty. A common ocean steamer can beat  them out.\" This last was uttered with the contemptuousness one always  feels toward a mighty government that allows itself to be outdone by  corporations or individuals.    \"Suppose you change her top hampers, and make her so that no one can  recognize her; say, tack on a false stem and stern to the water line,  will she still go as fast?\" continued the Colonel cautiously.    \"Certainly, provided you don't interfere with her hull,\" answered the  captain in surprise.    \"I will take the wheel,\" the Colonel said. The electric vessel from  whose wheel there was an unobstructed view ahead, without smokestack,  with masts that could for speed's sake be lowered, was steered like any  sail-boat, from her heaving stern. The owner's hand marked half speed,  quarter speed upon the indicator. To the disgust of the crew he gave  orders not to have the speed increased except to keep out of sight of  coasters. At dead of night the beauty was anchored in his own cove,  opposite his clapboard shooting lodge on the marsh. No one noticed his  approach. The marsh and the bay hid their secret.    The next day at dawn a transformation began to take place. The white  paint, the original and dainty body color of the electric yacht, was  changed to a dull gray, and the new coat looked as if it had been put on  in amateur patches, so dingy was its appearance. The boats on the davits  were touched up with a combination of green and black. They looked at  first glance as if a collier might have lost them at sea. The electric  launch was smeared with the refuse of the paintshop put into one pot.  The mixture attained was indescribable. But by far the greatest change  consisted of a false stem and stern. These were modelled and put on, so  that after a few screws were drawn, the mask would slip off, leaving the  original sheer of the boat in all its beauty. A large smokestack of  hollow timber, painted black with a red stripe, was improvised and set  up. This ornament led into the galley stove below, and the cook was  instructed to burn smoky materials when on the run. The deck was then  covered with canvas and painted a sickly yellow. The brass work went  unpolished. As may be imagined, the new model was as different from the  old as the carefully disguised ruffian on the stage is from his elegant  self.    \"Now she is ready,\" said Colonel Oddminton to his captain. \"I will  double the wages of all on board if the crew does not leave the ship or  converse with any person off of it except by order. My two colored men  will get all supplies. The future speed of my boat will be eight knots  an hour. She is incapable of going more. That is her limit until further  orders. Give command for an immediate start. We will now go to  Charleston.\"    The son and the crew from the captain down suspected that something was  in contemplation out of the usual run of pleasure trips. The son dared  ask his father no questions, though he burned with indignation at the  vandal changes. The crew did not care, even if they went pirating.  Nothing could overtake them. Their fuel was limitless. Their pay was  princely. Their cook was supreme. These stolid natures obeyed orders and  drew their rations with faithful punctuality.    It does not take long to run to Charleston, going at even so slow a  pace. Small steamers ply daily between the Sea Islands and the cotton  metropolis. It happened that some of the Colonel's acquaintances were on  board one of the passenger boats, and they saw this new craft lumbering  along, puffing out volumes of black smoke. They slowed up, and were soon  overtaken by the strange boat. The Colonel was sitting on deck.    \"Halloa,\" one of them yelled, laughing. \"Where did you pick up that  thing, Colonel?\"    \"Oh, down in New York. She's an old-fashioned steamer. I haven't had  time to get her fixed up yet,\" answered the Colonel. \"I always wanted a  steam yacht, and I got this cheap.\" The passengers set up a laugh.    \"We'll race you in,\" spoke up one of the Colonel's acquaintances, with a  wink at the others. The man knew the Colonel's weakness when he  challenged him.    \"All right,\" said the Colonel briskly. \"John!\" yelling forward, \"tell  the engineers to put more steam on and let her go.\"    New puffs of smoke came from the bogus smokestack. The sidewheeler  increased her pressure. It forged ahead at its highest speed, ten knots,  and no more. Colonel Oddminton swore, but to no effect. The passenger  vessel left the Colonel behind, amid jeers and all the catcalls familiar  to Southern methods of demonstration. The Colonel seemed heartbroken.  When he _steamed_ into Charleston harbor two hours after his ancient  rival, the wharf was crowded with the Colonel's \"friends.\" When the  Colonel came ashore he dropped a few characteristic oaths, ordered  drinks all around, and said that, after the _Mary Jane_ (that was the  name painted, on her square-stern) was prinked up and her bottom  scoured, she would beat the best of them yet. He had great faith in her  possibilities. At any rate she could go in a calm.    Similar performances were repeated for a week. The Colonel planned it to  get to the city in the morning and he went back "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#5)"],[1,"he  discovered to me honey, deposited in the clefts of rocks, or hollow  trees. But if he happened to have met with neither honey nor gum, and  his appetite had become sharp by his running about, I always witnessed  a very ludicrous scene. In those cases, he looked for roots, which he  ate with great greediness, especially a particular kind, which, to his  cost, I also found to be very well tasted and refreshing, and therefore  insisted upon sharing with him. But Kees was no fool. As soon as he  found such a root, and I was not near enough to seize upon my share of  it, he devoured it in the greatest haste, keeping his eyes all the  while riveted on me. He accurately measured the distance I had to pass  before I could get to him, and I was sure of coming too late.  Sometimes, however, when he had made a mistake in his calculation, and  I came upon him sooner than he expected, he endeavored to hide the  root--in which case, I compelled him, by a box on the ear, to give me  up my share.    \"When Kees happened to tire on the road, he mounted upon the back of  one of my dogs, who was so obliging as to carry him whole hours. One of  them, that was larger and stronger than the rest, hit upon a very  ingenious artifice, to avoid being pressed into this piece of service.  As soon as Kees leaped upon his back, he stood still, and let the train  pass, without moving from the spot. Kees still persisted in his  intention, till we were almost out of his sight, when he found himself  at length compelled to dismount, upon which both the baboon and dog  exerted all their speed to overtake us. The latter, however, gave him  the start, and kept a good look-out after him, that he might not serve  him in the same manner again. In fact, Kees enjoyed a certain authority  with all my dogs, for which he perhaps was indebted to the superiority  of his instinct. He could not endure a competitor if any of the dogs  came too near him when he was eating, he gave him a box on the ear,  which compelled him immediately to retire to a respectful distance.    \"Like most other domestic animals, Kees was addicted to stealing. He  understood admirably well how to loose the strings of a basket, in  order to take victuals out of it, especially milk, of which he was very  fond. My people chastised him for these thefts; but that did not make  him amend his conduct. I myself sometimes whipped him; but then he ran  away, and did not return again to the tent until it grew dark. Once, as  I was about to dine, and had put the beans, which I had boiled for  myself, upon a plate, I heard the voice of a bird with which I was not  acquainted. I left my dinner standing, seized my gun, and ran out of  the tent. After the space of about a quarter of an hour, I returned,  with the bird in my hand; but, to my astonishment, found not a single  bean upon the plate. Kees had stolen them all, and taken himself out of  the way.    \"When he had committed any trespass of this kind, he used always, about  the time when I drank tea, to return quietly, and seat himself in his  usual place, with every appearance of innocence, as if nothing had  happened; but this evening he did not let himself be seen. And on the  following day also he was not seen by any of us; and, in consequence, I  began to grow seriously uneasy about him, and apprehensive that he  might be lost forever. But, on the third day, one of my people, who had  been to fetch water, informed me that he had seen Kees in the  neighborhood; but that, as soon as the animal espied him, he had  concealed himself again. I immediately went out and beat the whole  neighborhood with my dogs. All at once, I heard a cry like that which  Kees used to make when I returned from my shooting, and had not taken  him with me. I looked about, and at length espied him, endeavoring to  hide himself behind the large branches of a tree. I now called to him  in a friendly tone of voice, and made motions to him to come down to  me. But he could not trust me, and I was obliged to climb up the tree  to fetch him. He did not attempt to fly, and we returned together to my  quarters: here he expected to receive his punishment; but I did  nothing, as it would have been of no use.    \"When any eatables had been pilfered at my quarters, the fault was  always laid first upon Kees; and rarely was the accusation unfounded.  For a time, the eggs, which a hen laid me, were constantly stolen away,  and I wished to ascertain whether I had to attribute this loss also to  him. For this purpose I went one morning to watch him, and waited till  the hen announced, by her cackling, that she had laid an egg. Kees was  sitting upon my vehicle; but, the moment he heard the hen's voice, he  leaped down, and was running to fetch the egg. When he saw me, he  suddenly stopped, and affected a careless posture, swaying himself  backwards upon his hind legs, and assuming a very innocent look; in  short, he employed all his art to deceive me with respect to his  design. His hypocritical manoeuvres only confirmed my suspicions;  and, in order, in my turn, to deceive him, I pretended not to attend to  him, and turned my back to the bush where the hen was cackling, upon  which he immediately sprang to the place. I ran after him, and came up  to him at the moment when he had broken the egg, and was swallowing it.  Having caught the thief in the fact, I gave him a good beating upon the  spot; but this severe chastisement did not prevent his soon stealing  fresh-laid eggs again.    \"As I was convinced that I should never be able to break Kees off his  natural vices, and that, unless I chained him up every morning, I  should never get an egg, I endeavored to accomplish my purpose in  another manner: I trained one of my dogs, as soon as the hen cackled,  to run to the nest, and bring me the egg, without breaking it. In a few  days, the dog had learned his lesson; but Kees, as soon as he heard the  hen cackle, ran with him to the nest. A contest now took place between  them, who should have the egg: often the dog was foiled, although he  was the stronger of the two. If he gained the victory, he ran joyfully  to me with the egg, and put it into my hand. Kees, nevertheless,  followed him, and did not cease to grumble and make threatening  grimaces at him, till he saw me take the egg,--as if he was comforted  for the loss of his booty by his adversary's not retaining it for  himself. If Kees got hold of the egg, he endeavored to run with it to a  tree, where, having devoured it, he threw down the shells upon his  adversary, as if to make game of him. In that case, the dog returned,  looking ashamed, from which I could conjecture the unlucky adventure he  had met with.    \"Kees was always the first awake in the morning, and, when it was the  proper time, he aroused the dogs, who were accustomed to his voice,  and, in general, obeyed, without hesitation, the slightest motions by  which he communicated his orders to them, immediately taking their  posts about the tent and carriage, as he directed them.\"    _A droll Mimic._--A clergyman of some distinction, in England, had a  tame baboon, which became so fond of him, that, wherever he went, it  was always desirous of accompanying him. Whenever, therefore, he had to  perform the service of his church, he was under the necessity of  shutting it up in his room.    Once, however, the animal escaped, and followed his master to the  church; and, silently mounting the sounding-board above the pulpit, he  lay perfectly still till the sermon commenced. He then crept to the  edge, and, overlooking the preacher, imitated his gestures in so  grotesque a manner, that the whole congregation was unavoidably made to  laugh.    The minister, surprised and confounded at this levity, severely rebuked  his audience for their conduct. The reproof failed of its intended  effect. The congregation still laughed, and the preacher, in the warmth  of his zeal, redoubled his vociferation and action. This last the ape  imitated so exactly, that the congregation could no longer restrain  themselves, but burst into a long and loud roar of laughter.    A friend of the preacher at length stepped up to him, and pointed out  the cause of this apparently improper conduct; and such was the arch  demeanor of the animal, that it was with the utmost difficulty that the  parson himself could maintain his gravity, while he ordered the sexton  to take the creature away.    MISCELLANEOUS ANECDOTES.--Immense troops of baboons inhabit the  mountains in the neighborhood of the Cape of Good Hope, whence they  descend to the plains, to devastate the gardens and orchards. In their  plundering excursions they are very cunning, always placing sentinels,  to prevent the main body from being surprised. They break the fruit to  pieces, cram it into their cheek-pouches, and keep it until hungry.  Whenever the sentinel discovers a man approaching, he sets up a loud  yell, which makes the whole troop retreat with the utmost precipitation.  They have been known to steal behind an unwary traveller resting near  their retreats, and carry off his food, which they would eat at a  little distance from him; and with absurd grimaces and gestures, in  ridicule, offer it back; at the same time greedily devouring it.    The following account is given by Lade: \"We traversed a great mountain  in the neighborhood of the Cape of Good Hope, and amused ourselves with  hunting large baboons, which are very numerous in that place. I can  neither describe all the arts practised by these animals, nor the  nimbleness and impudence with which they returned, after being pursued  by us. Sometimes they allowed us to approach so near that I was almost  certain of seizing them. But, when I made the attempt, they sprang, at  a single leap, ten paces from me, and mounted trees with equal agility,  from whence they looked at us with great indifference, and seemed to  derive pleasure from our astonishment.
