To make  this I kill an old hen or rooster, split it open, and mix equal parts  of fish oil and the juice that comes with oysters. If the track is  very old, I add an equal part of oil of assafoetida, and put the  mixture inside the hen, leaving the entrails in and sew it up  loosely. Then I tie it to a rope, and starting at the point where the  track leaves the water, drag it through the woods, not very far,  ending in the brook again. At several places along the line I secrete  traps, exactly in the path made by the drag.    A mink, striking the scent will follow it, and, there being no bait  to scare him or arouse his suspicions, will run along the track until  he gets into one of the traps. This is a good set to use in woods  where a bait would mean having your traps lifted by John Sneakum. I  don't know how it will work with others, but I have had fine success  with it, especially in the cases of old \"bait-shy mink.\"    Here is another set shown me by an old half-breed Indian. We were in  a light canoe, and were paddling up a little reed-fringed brook, from  ten to thirty feet wide. In the weeds were several muskrat houses. As  it was spring, they were all finished and the rats were no longer  working on them. The old man set two traps on the house, and barely  under water. Then he put a few drops of the scent that is found in a  sack just under the root of the mink's tail, on a leaf on the very  top of the muskrat house; and then placed a small piece of muskrat  with the fur on, beside the scent, fastening it with a skewer.    He said, \"mink, come 'long and smell 'nother mink an' muskrat on top  house. He clim' up, get caught, an' all drown good.\" \"But,\" said I,  \"muskrats will climb up too, 'cause you've got muskrat meat for  bait.\" \"Oh-h-h no!\" he chuckled. \"Muskrat he heap 'fraid of mink. We  have mink to-morrer-wonca, numpaw, yawha, yawminee mink (1, 2, 3, 4  mink). You see? Then you no call ol' In'jun big fool.\" Sure enough  next morning he had shagipee (6) mink to show for as many sets. The  principle was that the muskrat wouldn't climb up, for he would see  the fur and smell the mink scent, and think it was a mink.      [Illustration: INDIAN TRAPPER.]    Mink often follow muskrat trails, especially in the fall before the  snow comes. To set a trap in the trail would mean to catch a rat, and  make a meal for a mink; so I post a rooster's head about two feet  from the trail and set a No. 1 1/2 trap under it. The rat isn't  likely to leave the trail for the head, but the mink will, unless he  is hot after a muskrat.    When brooks unite and form a \"Y\" there is often a little sand pit  left in the crotch of the \"Y.\" I hang a piece of muskrat meat with  mink scent on it upon a small stick leaning out over my trap, which  is set in two or three inches of water, and staked out so as to drown  the mink.    An Indian subscriber of the Hunter-Trader-Trapper and who writes of  his experiences occasionally to that interesting magazine, in one  season caught with dog and trapped in Northwestern Pennsylvania 104  mink. The name of this Indian is John Lord, and he has trapped as far  west as California. The illustration shows him to be a young man. The  picture shown here was taken in 1905 when he was hunting and trapping  in Pennsylvania.    The 104 mink were caught during the season of 1905-6, and as the  pelts were high then it can be seen that he makes considerable money.  The fact that he caught that number is pretty well established by  several well known parties. John is an Iroquois and a good fellow and  trapper.        CHAPTER VIII.    MINK TRAPPING ON THE PRAIRIE.    As there has not been much written on mink trapping on the prairie, I  will give a few hints for the benefit of young prairie trappers, on  trapping mink, says a Minnesota trapper. In the first place the steel  trap is about the only trap that can be used; there being no timber  over large portions of the Northwest and Canada.    I wait till ice is frozen over the runways and ponds, then I go at it  making a circuit of the runways. I find where the mink go out from  the shore to some muskrat's home, which will have a pole in it above  water. I set two traps there, then look around. Close by I will find  a small dump of trash made by muskrats, where the mink go to dung. I  set two or three traps so when set and covered with fine brush they  will be even with the surface and looking natural. I will then go on  shore which is generally flat, following the mink signs I will find  where they have dug into an old muskrat run. I put two or three traps  around here close together so when caught the mink soon gets in two  traps, then he is there to stay.    I use no bait when setting at a place like this; the first mink  caught smells the place up so there is no need of any patent scent.  Every mink that gets on that swamp, if it is not over two or three  miles long, will visit that place in one or two nights. At a place  like that I leave the traps all winter and will catch as many mink as  a trapper that scatters twice as many traps, one in a place, all over  the swamp.    There are one or two places in every swamp or pond where nearly every  mink will visit. It may be a hole in a bank or an old muskrat house.  You can tell it by the signs or by tracks in the snow. There is the  place, then you are sure of your mink.    I make small iron stakes to fasten my traps where I can get nothing  for a drag. I make them myself. Take a rod 1/4 inch thick, cut in  lengths 8 inches long, turn one end when hot over the ring of trap  chain, sharpen the other end. I only lost one mink last winter by  gnawing his foot off. A fish is good bait for mink, also fish oil and  fresh rabbits or birds. When buying traps, buy the best, they are the  cheapest in the long run.    Some trappers buy the cheap traps and lose enough fur the first  season to pay for good traps.    I find that it pays to stretch and care for furs well. I have bought  furs that were not worth one third price. Mink were stretched 6  inches wide at tail tapering to a point at nose, being 8 inches long,  when they should have been 16 or 20 inches and 3 to 4 wide. Again I  have got them that they were stretched so tight you could see through  them.      [Illustration: CAMPING OUT.]    Some trappers claim the mink is very sly and hard to trap, others  that he is very easy to trap, and that they could catch an unlimited  number if the mink were only plentiful in their locality. I always  like to read anything I can find on this subject, says an Illinois  trapper. Sometimes I find methods that I have used with good success,  methods that I think would be good, and methods that I think would  never work in any locality. Not like the muskrat, the habits of the  mink are almost the same in all localities, but changing some in  different seasons of the year. In Central Illinois along with the  change of seasons, we have wet and dry seasons, and good methods of  trapping in the dry season will not work at all in the wet.    When I first started trapping mink I met with very good success, not  due to any good method, but as far back as I can remember I have  always been a lover of nature, and I was not a stranger to the habits  of the mink. And I will say right here to all young trappers, and  also to some older ones--learn the habits of the animal you wish to  trap, and if you are half a trapper, success will be yours. I have  learned many things that I never knew before I trapped for him, but I  would not trade what I knew before for what I have learned since. I  am going to try to make plain to you, brother trappers, some of the  methods we use here in Illinois, and I believe these same methods  will work in all localities.    This section of the country is cut up with small ditches and small  creeks, ideal places for mink and muskrat. In the dry season all the  tile ditches and small creeks have very little water in them, and no  better places can the mink find than a dry tile or an old muskrat  den. Here they will live until the water drives them out in the  spring.    When setting the trap at a tile, if the tile is too large, a couple  of sticks stuck in front of the tile will narrow the opening, and a  trap set properly in front of the tile will be very apt to catch the  mink going in or out of the tile. Always see that the jaws of the  trap rest firmly on the ground and that there is no danger of dirt or  sticks or even grass getting in between the jaws of the trap, for if  it does you will lose your mink even if he gets caught. A mink that  has once been caught in a trap is doubly hard to catch, although I  have met two exceptions to that rule, and will say that they were two  of the blindest mink I ever trapped.    Fine grass, dried willow leaves, rabbit fur, or most any light  material that will not interfere with the workings of the trap and  will not make too great a contrast to the surroundings, will be good  to cover the trap. Always be careful not to disturb the surroundings  too much, as a mink will notice this quicker than the scent you leave  on the traps when you set them.    A good rule to follow is--always set your trap facing the way you  think the mink is going to come, never sideways if possible to set  any other. In setting at an old rat den, if possible always set the  trap a couple of inches inside of the den and pull the spring around  so a mink going into the hole will not step on the spring.    If you catch a female mink first, always reset the trap, as the  chances are greatly in your favor of catching the male soon, and if  mink are plentiful in your locality you may catch as many as a half a  dozen males if in the running season. If you can find where an old  rat hole leads down to the edge of the water from the top of the  bank, a trap set in the lower end of this hole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34098"],[0,"Science of Trapping (#5)"],[1,"log, spanning the  stream. The log protects the traps from rain or snow, and a glance at  the cut will show that it would be practically impossible for a mink  to pass along the stream without being caught. The same set is good  for the raccoon. If the stream is frozen fill the opening, under the  log, with old, dead brush, so that there is no chance for the mink to  pass, except over the traps.    Another good method for the wary mink is as follows: find a high,  steep bank along the stream; if it overhangs, so much the better, and  about two feet above the water, make a hole about four inches in  diameter, and a foot or more deep. Leave the dirt that you dig out,  rest directly in front of the hole, and set the trap in this dirt,  covering with same. Pack dry moss around the jaws and cover the trap  first with a sheet of paper, finishing with a thin layer of dirt. Put  some good mink scent in the hole; the musk of the mink itself is best  for this set. If the traps can be visited every day, it is a good  plan to stake the trap, so that the mink will roll around over the  ground, and the next one will be more easily caught.    Where mink travel around a lake, go to the outlet and lay a hollow  log across the stream, just where the water leaves the lake. Set a  trap in this log, covering with fine, rotten wood, and every mink  that travels around the lake, will attempt to run through the log,  and will be caught. If you cannot find a hollow log near at hand,  build a covered passage-way of poles and chunks, and set your trap in  this passage.    Mink may also be taken in box traps and deadfalls.    Scents are much used and there are some few which have proved  attractive. Fish oil is one of the most common scents for mink and  other animals. It is made by taking fish of almost any kind, cutting  them into small pieces, and putting in a wide mouthed bottle. Let  stand in a warm place, loosely covered, until the fish are thoroughly  rotted, and in a liquid state; this scent may be used alone or  combined with others.    If a female mink can be caught, during the mating season, remove the  generative organs, and place them in a bottle, adding about two  ounces of fish oil and all of the mink musk you can get. This is  undoubtedly the best scent ever devised. It should be used without  bait.    In traveling, the mink goes \"the jump\" and its foot-prints are  always in pairs, the space between each set being from eighteen to  twenty-four inches. The footprints will measure from one to one and  one-fourth inches in length, with one always somewhat in advance of  the other.      [Illustration: The Weasel.]        CHAPTER IV.    THE WEASEL.    The weasel is the smallest of all carnivorous animals and the various  species and varieties are distributed over the greater portion of  northern Asia, Europe and North America. In this country alone  naturalists recognize some twenty species and sub-species, most of  which are found in Canada and Alaska, also the northern and western  states. Of these it is only the northern varieties, those which  become white in winter that are of importance to the trapper.    The ermine of Europe is a species of weasel, and the American white  weasel is sometimes called the ermine, its fur being used to imitate  the fur of that animal.    The change of color in the fur of this animal is not understood by  naturalists. It occurs only in the most northern portions of its  range and it is not known whether the animal really sheds its brown  summer coat when the cold weather approaches or whether the fur  bleaches, but it is certain that the change occurs in some way, the  fur becoming white in the fall and changing to brown again in spring.    The smallest variety of the weasel is found in northwestern Canada  and Alaska and with it the black tip of the tail so characteristic of  the weasel is missing. Very large weasels are secured in the northern  part of Maine, but it is said that the finest skins are obtained in  Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.    The weasel from many sections have a peculiar, sulphury yellow cast  to the fur, especially on the hind-quarters, and of many of these  stained skins only the black tip of the tail is of value. What causes  the stain is not known, neither is there any known method for  removing it. One fur buyer states that about seven out of every ten  skins received, show this yellow stain and are of little value.    The weasel is one of the most blood-thirsty of animals and is very  courageous. It is a terror to rats, mice, rabbits, partridges and  poultry. It will kill for the love of slaughter, even when not  hungry, and I have known a single animal to kill more than thirty  chickens in a night, sucking only a little of the blood from each.    On one occasion I knew a farmer who had turned a drove of fair-sized  pigs into a pasture, and one day, hearing a wild squealing over along  the pasture fence, went to investigate. He found the entire drove of  porkers running along the fence and squealing from terror and  following them was a little brown weasel.    Curiosity is highly developed in the weasel. Many times I have seen  them in my camp at night and if I remained perfectly quiet they would  approach to within a few feet and stand upright on their hind legs to  get a good view. At the least movement, however, they would disappear  only to return a minute later.    As before mentioned the weasel is a blood-thirsty creature, and when  it finds some food that is to its liking it can scarcely be driven  away. On various occasions I have found them attempting to remove the  bait from my traps and such times I would adjust the trap so as to be  very easily sprung, and then step aside and wait for the animal to be  caught.    The weasel has a sharp eye and a keen nose. While trapping in the  North I would always keep on hand a supply of snared rabbits for use  as bait, and often weasels would come into the camp at night,  attracted by the bait, and it is interesting to note how quickly they  could scent out the freshest rabbit in the pile and by biting into  its ears would attempt to drag it away. Quite often they were able to  move a fair sized rabbit. I usually kept a trap setting in my camp  and in this way in one season caught fifteen weasels in one camp.    I have never learned anything regarding the breeding habits of the  weasel, but judging from the large numbers of these animals found in  favorable localities I would say that they are very prolific.    For trapping this animal I recommend the No. 1 1/2 trap and prefer a  trap that is loosely hinged and springs easily, such as the Victor.  Any trap will hold a weasel but when caught in the smaller sizes they  quite often double up about the jaws and when they die and freeze in  that position it is difficult to remove them from the trap. With the  1 1/2 they are always caught over the body and there is little  trouble from that source. As the animal is so very light in weight it  is necessary that the trap springs very easily. There are various  styles of rat traps on the market which make excellent weasel traps,  but as one never knows what animal may happen along, I prefer to use  the steel trap.    My method of setting is to place the trap inside of a small enclosure  of chunks of wood, bark, sticks or whatever is most convenient. No  covering is needed but when setting on the snow I make a bed of  evergreen boughs for the trap to rest on. Rotten wood will answer  just as well. I fasten the bait with a stick just back of the trap so  that the weasel will be obliged to stand on the trap when attempting  to remove the bait, for it should be remembered that they will never  eat any food where they find it if able to move it away. Fasten the  trap securely for some larger animal is likely to be caught. I do not  place the traps far apart, where tracks are seen in fair numbers, and  I drag a fresh killed rabbit from set to set, splitting it open with  a knife so as to leave a bloody trail. Any weasel that strikes the  trail is sure to follow it.    For bait I prefer rabbit to anything else as it contains more blood  than other baits and fresh blood is the only scent that I know of  which will attract the weasel.    In order to obtain good prices it is necessary that the fur be kept  clean and I use a small cloth bag in which to carry my catch.    The tracks of the weasel resemble those of the mink but are  considerably smaller. The average length of jump is perhaps about  eighteen inches.      [Illustration: The Marten.]        CHAPTER V.    THE MARTEN.    The marten is a carnivorous animal belonging to the same family as  the weasel. The principal species are the pine marten of North  America, the beech or stone marten of northern Europe, the sable of  Russia and Siberia and the Japanese sable. Naturalists usually class  the fisher with the martens, also. The Russian sable is the finest of  the martens, the pine marten of Labrador being next in value. The  pine marten is found throughout the timbered regions of Canada and  Alaska, also in the mountainous districts of the western states. A  few are still found in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New  York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.    In size the marten is about the same as the mink of the North and  East, being somewhat lighter in the body, but the longer fur causes  it to appear fully as large. It has longer legs than the mink, and  the feet are larger and heavily furred. The tail is thick and bushy,  the ears and eyes, large and the muzzle is more pointed than that of  the mink. The fur is very fine and soft, the color varying from a  rich yellow to almost black. The fur of the tail is darker than that  of the body, and the face, lighter. The ears, on the edges, are  greyish white and there Is always a yellow or orange spot on the  throat.    In the more southern portions of their range, the martens are quite  pale. The finest and"]]]
