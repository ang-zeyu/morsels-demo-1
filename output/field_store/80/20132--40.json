Mr. Squirrel coughed twice and straightened his  vest before he began, so they knew his poem wasn't to be funny.      THE FOOLISH LITTLE LAD    BY MR. GRAY SQUIRREL            Once on a time, the story goes,            A silly squirrel lad          One summer day did run away--            Which made his ma feel bad.            She hunted for him up and down            And round and round she ran--          Alas, that foolish squirrel boy            Was caught by Mr. Man.            For he had tried to climb a tree            As Mr. Man came past.          \"I'll make you climb!\" said Mr. Man,            And walked home pretty fast.            When he got there a boy came out            As Mr. Man went in.          That silly squirrel soon was put            Into a house of tin.            \"Now you can climb!\" said Mr. Man,            But when he did he found          That nice tin house, so bright and new,            Turned round and round and round.            And there he climbs and climbs all day            And never seems to stop,          And I have heard my mother say            He'll never reach the top.    When Mr. Squirrel sat down there wasn't a dry eye in the room, and even  Mr. Dog outside was affected. He said he'd seen that poor little  squirrel at Mr. Man's house turning and turning away in his tin wheel,  and felt so sorry for him that two or three times he'd tried to get him  out. He said, though, that Mr. Man had always caught him at it and that  then they didn't get on well for a day or two. He was so tender hearted,  though, he said, that he couldn't help pitying the little fellow,  climbing and climbing all day long and never getting anywhere. Mr.  'Possum shivered, and said it reminded him of bad dreams he'd had  sometimes, when he'd eaten too much supper, and dreamed of climbing the  rainbow. Then they all sat still and waited for Mr. Turtle, who came  next.      MY SNUG HOUSE    BY D'LAND TURTLE            Oh, what do I care for your houses of wood,            Your houses of brick or of stone,          When I have a house that is cozy and good--            A beautiful house of my own?          And the doors will not sag and the roof will not crack          Of the house that I carry about on my back.            It is never too large and 'tis never too small,            It is with me wherever I roam.          In spring or in summer, in winter or fall,            I always can find my way home.          For it isn't so hard to remember the track          To the house that you carry about on your back.    Well, of course, everybody applauded that, and then it was Mr. 'Coon's  time. Mr. 'Coon said he was like Mr. 'Possum. He wasn't much on poetry,  and only had four lines. He said they were some like Mr. 'Possum's too.      THE BEST THINGS    BY Z. 'COON            I like the spring, I like the fall,            I like the cold and heat,          And poems, too, but best of all            I like good things to eat.    That brought the house down, and the Hollow Tree people thought the  entertainment was over. They were going to have supper right away, but  Mr. Dog called out to wait a minute. He said he had a little poem  himself that he wanted to read. So out of politeness they all sat still,  though they didn't expect very much. Then Mr. Dog unrolled his poem and  leaned over close to the blinds and commenced to read.      MY FOREST FRIENDS    BY MR. DOG            Oh, dear to me my forest friends,            Especially Mr. Rabbit--          I love his poetry very much,            And every gentle habit.            And dear to me is Mr. 'Coon,            And also Mr. 'Possum;          I hope to win their friendship soon--            'Twill be a precious blossom.            And Mr. Crow and Robin, too,            With fancy sweet and fertile,          And Mr. Squirrel, kind and true,            And likewise Mr. Turtle.    [Illustration: LEANED OVER CLOSE TO THE BLINDS AND COMMENCED TO READ]            Oh, dear to me my forest friends,            Especially Mr. Rabbit--          I love his poetry very much,            And every gentle habit.    Before Mr. Dog was half through reading the Hollow Tree people had  gathered around the window to listen. By the time he got to the end of  the third stanza he had to stop for them to cheer, and when he read the  last one, Jack Rabbit pounded on the shutter with his fist and shouted,  \"Hurrah for Mr. Dog! Hurrah for Mr. Dog!\" just as loud as ever he could,  while all the others crowded up and shouted and tried to pound, too.    Well, maybe the shutter wasn't very strong, or maybe they crowded and  pounded too hard in their excitement over Mr. Dog's nice poem, for all  at once there was a loud crack and the shutter flew open and out went  Mr. Rabbit right smack into the arms of Mr. Dog!    [Illustration: OUT WENT MR. RABBIT RIGHT SMACK INTO THE ARMS OF MR. DOG]    I tell you that was pretty sudden and Mr. Rabbit was scared. So were all  the others, and they were going to grab the shutter and close it again  and leave Mr. Rabbit out there. But Jack Rabbit thinks quick.    \"Oh, Mr. Dog,\" he said, \"that was the nicest poem I ever heard. Let me  embrace you, Mr. Dog, and be your friend for ever after!\"    Then he hugged Mr. Dog just as tight as he could, and Mr. Dog hugged  him, too, and shed tears, he was that happy. He had been wanting to make  up with the forest people for a long time, but he hadn't expected this.  Then the others all saw how it was and they shouted, \"Hurrah for Mr.  Dog!\" again and invited him in. And Mr. Dog went in and they had the  biggest supper and the biggest time that ever was known in the Hollow  Tree.    And that's how Mr. Dog got to be friends with all the Hollow Tree people  at last. And he stayed friends with them ever and ever so long--and  longer--just as long as he lived, for the Mr. Dog that isn't good  friends with them now isn't the same Mr. Dog. And he isn't as smart,  either, for he can't write poetry, and he's never even been able to  find the Hollow Tree where the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow  live together and every summer keep open house for their friends.          MR. RABBIT'S UNWELCOME COMPANY    MR. POLECAT MAKES A MORNING CALL AND MR. DOG DROPS IN      I THINK I shall have to tell you about Mr. Polecat, said the Story  Teller, and about his visit to Mr. Rabbit.    \"Who's Mr. Polecat?\" said the Little Lady. \"You never told me about him  before.\"    Well, no, because you see Mr. Polecat is so queer in some of his ways  that people even don't talk about him a great deal. He is really quite a  nice gentleman, though, when he doesn't get excited. But when he does he  loses friends.    The trouble is with the sort of perfumery he uses when he gets excited,  just as some people use a smelling-bottle, and nobody seems to like the  sort Mr. Polecat uses except himself. I suppose he must like it or he  wouldn't be so free with it. But other people go away when he uses  it--mostly in the direction the wind's blowing from--and in a hurry, as  if they were afraid they'd miss a train. Even Mr. Dog doesn't stop to  argue with Mr. Polecat. Nobody does, and all the other Deep Woods people  do their best to make him happy and to keep him in a good humor whenever  he comes about, and give him their nicest things to eat and a lot to  carry home with him, so he'll start just as soon as possible.    But, more than anything, they try to keep him from saying anything about  Mr. Dog, or hinting or even thinking about Mr. Dog, for when he does any  of these things he's apt to get excited, and then sometimes he opens up  that perfume of his, and his friends fall over each other to get out of  reach. They're never very happy to see him coming, and they're always  glad to see him go, even when he's had a quiet visit and goes pretty  soon, which is just what didn't happen one time when he came to call on  Jack Rabbit, and it's that time I'm going to tell about. This was before  Mr. Dog made up with the Hollow Tree people; I don't know exactly how  long before, but a good while.    Mr. Rabbit looked out his door one morning and there was Mr. Polecat,  all dressed up, coming to see him. He wasn't very far off, either, and  Mr. Rabbit hardly had time to jerk down a crayon picture of Mr. Dog that  he'd made the day before, just for practice. He pushed it under the bed  quick, and when Mr. Polecat came up he bowed and smiled, and said what a  nice day it was, and that he'd bring a chair outside if Mr. Polecat  would like to sit there instead of coming in where it wasn't so  pleasant.    But Mr. Polecat said he guessed he'd come in, as it was a little chilly  and he didn't feel very well anyway. So he came inside, and Jack Rabbit  gave him his best chair and brought out a little table and put a lot of  nice things on it that Mr. Polecat likes, and began right away to pack a  basket for him to take home.    But Mr. Polecat didn't seem to be in any hurry to go. He ate some of the  nice things, and then leaned back to talk and smoke, and told Mr. Rabbit  all the news he'd heard as he came along, and Mr. Rabbit got more and  more worried, for he knew that just as likely as not Mr. Polecat had  heard something about Mr. Dog and would begin to tell it pretty soon,  and then no knowing what would happen. So Jack Rabbit just said \"Yes\"  and \"No\" and began to talk about Mr. Robin, because Mr. Robin was a good  friend of everybody and nobody could get excited just talking about Mr.  Robin. But Mr. Polecat says:--    \"Oh, yes, I saw Mr. Robin as I came along, and he called to me that Mr.  Dog--\"    And then Jack Rabbit changed the subject as quick as he could and spoke  about Mr. Squirrel, and Mr. Polecat says:--    \"Oh, did you hear how Mr. Squirrel went over to Mr. Man's house and saw  Mr. Dog there--\"    And then poor Mr. Rabbit had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37472"],[0,"Zanzibar Tales: Told (#5)"],[1," you from  the sun some day.\"    So 'Mvoo Laana took him out of the trap and let him go.    When Neeanee had climbed up in a tree, he sat on a branch and said  to the youth: \"For your kindness I will give you a piece of advice:  Believe me, men are all bad. Never do a good turn for a man; if you  do, he will do you harm at the first opportunity.\"    The second day, 'Mvoo Laana found a snake in the same trap. He  started to the village to give the alarm, but the snake shouted:  \"Come back, son of Adam; don't call the people from the village to  come and kill me. I am Neeo'ka, the snake. Let me out of this trap,  I pray you. Save me from the rain to-day, that I may be able to save  you from the sun to-morrow, if you should be in need of help.\"    So the youth let him go; and as he went he said, \"I will return your  kindness if I can, but do not trust any man; if you do him a kindness  he will do you an injury in return at the first opportunity.\"    The third day, 'Mvoo Laana found a lion in the same trap that had  caught the ape and the snake, and he was afraid to go near it. But  the lion said: \"Don't run away; I am Sim'ba Kong'way, the very old  lion. Let me out of this trap, and I will not hurt you. Save me from  the rain, that I may save you from the sun if you should need help.\"    So 'Mvoo Laana believed him and let him out of the trap, and Simba  Kongway, before going his way, said: \"Son of Adam, you have been kind  to me, and I will repay you with kindness if I can; but never do a  kindness to a man, or he will pay you back with unkindness.\"    The next day a man was caught in the same trap, and when the youth  released him, he repeatedly assured him that he would never forget the  service he had done him in restoring his liberty and saving his life.    Well, it seemed that he had caught all the game that could be taken  in traps, and 'Mvoo Laana and his mother were hungry every day, with  nothing to satisfy them, as they had been before. At last he said to  his mother, one day: \"Mother, make me seven cakes of the little meal  we have left, and I will go hunting with my bow and arrows.\" So she  baked him the cakes, and he took them and his bow and arrows and went  into the forest.    The youth walked and walked, but could see no game, and finally he  found that he had lost his way, and had eaten all his cakes but one.    And he went on and on, not knowing whether he was going away from  his home or toward it, until he came to the wildest and most desolate  looking wood he had ever seen. He was so wretched and tired that he  felt he must lie down and die, when suddenly he heard some one calling  him, and looking up he saw Neeanee, the ape, who said, \"Son of Adam,  where are you going?\"    \"I don't know,\" replied 'Mvoo Laana, sadly; \"I'm lost.\"    \"Well, well,\" said the ape; \"don't worry. Just sit down here and  rest yourself until I come back, and I will repay with kindness the  kindness you once showed me.\"    Then Neeanee went away off to some gardens and stole a whole lot of  ripe paw-paws and bananas, and brought them to 'Mvoo Laana, and said:  \"Here's plenty of food for you. Is there anything else you want? Would  you like a drink?\" And before the youth could answer he ran off with a  calabash and brought it back full of water. So the youth ate heartily,  and drank all the water he needed, and then each said to the other,  \"Good-bye, till we meet again,\" and went their separate ways.    When 'Mvoo Laana had walked a great deal farther without finding  which way he should go, he met Simba Kongway, who asked, \"Where are  you going, son of Adam?\"    And the youth answered, as dolefully as before, \"I don't know;  I'm lost.\"    \"Come, cheer up,\" said the very old lion, \"and rest yourself here a  little. I want to repay with kindness to-day the kindness you showed  me on a former day.\"    So 'Mvoo Laana sat down. Simba Kongway went away, but soon returned  with some game he had caught, and then he brought some fire, and the  young man cooked the game and ate it. When he had finished he felt a  great deal better, and they bade each other good-bye for the present,  and each went his way.    After he had traveled another very long distance the youth came to  a farm, and was met by a very, very old woman, who said to him:  \"Stranger, my husband has been taken very sick, and I am looking  for some one to make him some medicine. Won't you make it?\" But he  answered: \"My good woman, I am not a doctor, I am a hunter, and never  used medicine in my life. I can not help you.\"    When he came to the road leading to the principal city he saw a well,  with a bucket standing near it, and he said to himself: \"That's just  what I want. I'll take a drink of nice well-water. Let me see if the  water can be reached.\"    As he peeped over the edge of the well, to see if the water was high  enough, what should he behold but a great big snake, which, directly  it saw him, said, \"Son of Adam, wait a moment.\" Then it came out of  the well and said: \"How? Don't you know me?\"    \"I certainly do not,\" said the youth, stepping back a little.    \"Well, well!\" said the snake; \"I could never forget you. I am Neeoka,  whom you released from the trap. You know I said, 'Save me from the  rain, and I will save you from the sun.' Now, you are a stranger in  the town to which you are going; therefore hand me your little bag,  and I will place in it the things that will be of use to you when  you arrive there.\"    So 'Mvoo Laana gave Neeoka the little bag, and he filled it with  chains of gold and silver, and told him to use them freely for his  own benefit. Then they parted very cordially.    When the youth reached the city, the first man he met was he whom  he had released from the trap, who invited him to go home with him,  which he did, and the man's wife made him supper.    As soon as he could get away unobserved, the man went to the sultan  and said: \"There is a stranger come to my house with a bag full of  chains of silver and gold, which he says he got from a snake that  lives in a well. But although he pretends to be a man, I know that  he is a snake who has power to look like a man.\"    When the sultan heard this he sent some soldiers who brought 'Mvoo  Laana and his little bag before him. When they opened the little bag,  the man who was released from the trap persuaded the people that some  evil would come out of it, and affect the children of the sultan and  the children of the vizir.    Then the people became excited, and tied the hands of 'Mvoo Laana  behind him.    But the great snake had come out of the well and arrived at the town  just about this time, and he went and lay at the feet of the man who  had said all those bad things about 'Mvoo Laana, and when the people  saw this they said to that man: \"How is this? There is the great snake  that lives in the well, and he stays by you. Tell him to go away.\"    But Neeoka would not stir. So they untied the young man's hands,  and tried in every way to make amends for having suspected him of  being a wizard.    Then the sultan asked him, \"Why should this man invite you to his  home and then speak ill of you?\"    And 'Mvoo Laana related all that had happened to him, and how the ape,  the snake, and the lion had cautioned him about the results of doing  any kindness for a man.    And the sultan said: \"Although men are often ungrateful, they are  not always so; only the bad ones. As for this fellow, he deserves  to be put in a sack and drowned in the sea. He was treated kindly,  and returned evil for good.\"                VII.    HAAMDAANEE.      Once there was a very poor man, named Haamdaa'nee, who begged from  door to door for his living, sometimes taking things before they  were offered him. After a while people became suspicious of him, and  stopped giving him anything, in order to keep him away from their  houses. So at last he was reduced to the necessity of going every  morning to the village dust heap, and picking up and eating the few  grains of the tiny little millet seed that he might find there.    One day, as he was scratching and turning over the heap, he found a  dime, which he tied up in a corner of his ragged dress, and continued  to hunt for millet grains, but could not find one.    \"Oh, well,\" said he, \"I've got a dime now; I'm pretty well fixed. I'll  go home and take a nap instead of a meal.\"    So he went to his hut, took a drink of water, put some tobacco in  his mouth, and went to sleep.    The next morning, as he scratched in the dust heap, he saw a countryman  going along, carrying a basket made of twigs, and he called to him:  \"Hi, there, countryman! What have you in that cage?\"    The countryman, whose name was Moohaad'eem, replied, \"Gazelles.\"    And Haamdaanee called: \"Bring them here. Let me see them.\"    Now there were three well-to-do men standing near; and when they  saw the countryman coming to Haamdaanee they smiled, and said,  \"You're taking lots of trouble for nothing, Moohaadeem.\"    \"How's that, gentlemen?\" he inquired.    \"Why,\" said they, \"that poor fellow has nothing at all. Not a cent.\"    \"Oh, I don't know that,\" said the countryman; \"he may have plenty,  for all I know.\"    \"Not he,\" said they.    \"Don't you see for yourself,\" continued one of them, \"that he is on  the dust heap? Every day he scratches there like a hen, trying to get  enough grains of millet to keep himself alive. If he had any money,  wouldn't he buy a square meal, for once in his life? Do you think he  would want to buy a gazelle? What would he do with it? He can't find  enough food for himself, without looking for any for a gazelle.\"    But Moohaadeem said: \"Gentlemen, I have brought some goods here to  sell. I answer all who call me, and if any one says 'Come,' I go to  him. I don't favor one and slight another; therefore, as this man  called me, I'm going to him.\"    \"All right,\" said the first man; \"you don't believe us. Well, we  know where he lives, and all"]]]
