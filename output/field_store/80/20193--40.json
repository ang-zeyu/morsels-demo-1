The other is Ferdinando Martini, a governor of one of Italy's colonies,  a minister of public instruction, a deputy of long service, a poet, an  essayist, a biographer, and a traveller, the Italian Admirable Crichton.  He was born in Monsummano in 1841, and for forty-five years was without  interruption in the Chamber of Deputies. He went under in the last  election. He has published many books and articles, amongst which may be  mentioned \"Nell' Africa Italiana\" (\"In African Italy\"), but the casual  reader will get most pleasurable contact with him from \"Pagine  Raccolte.\" He is an excellent example of the cultured man in public life  in Italy. His prose integrates the aroma of the classics, while at the  same time his sympathies and interests bring his subjects up to the  minute. His writings have a pragmatic as well as an aesthetic quality.  None of them has the air of preachings. He knows how to be profound  without being heavy and learned without being pedantic. For him  literature has not been an aesthetic exercise or a statement of human  rights and human needs. Prospective admirers should not study too  closely his political career.    Death has claimed nearly all of the conspicuous figures of literature in  the period of the risorgimento. One who had a strange tenacity of life,  which he but recently yielded, was Salvatore Farina, whose first  romances, \"Un Segreto\" (\"A Secret\") and \"Due Amori\" (\"Two Loves\"), were  published more than fifty years ago. He was, perhaps, the truly  representative writer of the Piccolo Borghese in the generation that  followed Italy's unity. In the fifty or more volumes that he published  (the last of which appeared in 1912 and was called the \"Second Book of  the Lovers\") he portrayed a variety of romanticism which was the  outgrowth of the struggle between the drab and commonplace realities of  life and the fantastic dreams of simple-minded persons who thought that  life would be ideal if it could be fashioned after their own plans. He  was the novelist of sickly sentiment, the most slavish disciple that  Samuel Richardson ever had. Students of Italian literature will read his  two reminiscent volumes called \"La mia Giornata,\" the first published in  1910, the second in 1913, to get a picture of the literary doings of one  of the grayest and most uncertain periods of modern Italian literature.  He is mentioned here merely to note the tremendous popularity which his  writings had, and to call attention to the fact that they left no  impression upon the times and that the type of novel which they  represent has practically now disappeared the world over.          CHAPTER II    LITERARY ITALY    (CONTINUED)      Among the interesting literary figures of the old school still living is  Renato Fucini, whose pen-name is Neri Tanfucio. He is now nearly eighty  years old, and for some years has been living in a small town not far  from Florence, writing his recollections. In college he studied civil  engineering, but he soon forsook it and secured employment in the office  of the Municipal Art Direction in Florence. Later he taught Italian in  the technical school at Pistoia and after that was several years an  inspector of rural schools. It was during these years of wandering  through Tuscany that he got the intimate knowledge of its simple,  industrial, pleasure-loving people, peasant and poacher, landlord and  inspector, teacher and pupil, that he has embodied in his stories and in  his burlesque, tragic, and sentimental verses.    His fame rests on his dialect poetry (\"Poesie\"), chiefly in sonnet form,  in which he depicts the virtues and vices, the licenses and inhibitions,  the hopes and the despairs, of his fellow Tuscans, at the same time  embodying delightful descriptions of their charming, romantic land; and  a few small volumes of prose, all little masterpieces--\"Napoli a occhio  nudo\" (\"Naples to the Naked Eye,\" letters written to a friend about that  enchanting city two generations ago when it was still plunged in the  misery of its protracted predatory misrule and the majority of its  inhabitants were reduced to a deplorable state); \"All' Aria Aperta\" (\"In  the Open Air\"), scenes and incidents of life among the common people of  Tuscany; and \"Le Veglie di Neri\" (\"Fireside Evenings of Neri\"), which  showed him a man of heart and of mind supremely capable of transforming  the messages of the former by the latter in such a way as to make great  appeal to his fellow beings. His books can be read to-day with the same  pleasure that they were read half a century ago, and the pictures which  are painted, particularly in the former, are as vivid as the day they  were first put on the canvas.    Fucini is a type that is indigenous to central Italy, by nature a lover  of the fields, the forest, the brooks, he was compelled from earliest  infancy to earn his living, and he seemed to be content with a bare  sustenance, getting pleasure from his wanderings and from books. He did  on foot and more intimately what Signore Panzini has done on a bicycle  or on way trains. As an inspector of country schools he was obliged to  visit countless villages and hamlets, and there he found in the habits,  customs, and conduct of their inhabitants material for comment and  reflections such as most people find in new countries and large cities.  His descriptions of them found sympathetic response in the hearts of  many who see in the lives of these simple yet sophisticated people the  romance of bygone days.    Fucini has not cut a great figure in Italian letters, but any one who  would get a familiarity with the literature of the early days of Italian  unity, or who is in search of diversion and delight should not neglect  him. He is a sympathetic figure, whether wandering through Tuscany,  bending over a table in the Riccardi Library, or awaiting his cue at  Empoli.    A writer of this period to whom posterity is likely to give a high  rating is Alfredo Oriani, who died in 1907. His fame will finally rest  on his fiction rather than on his historical contributions. Though \"La  lotta politica in Italia\" (\"The Political Struggle in Italy\"), from 486  to 1877 in three volumes, is a creditable performance, it is not based  on personal research. Malignant-minded critics have occupied themselves  with proving him a pilferer, but the work is done with such consummate  literary skill that he has put the reading world under obligations to  him.    His first books, \"Memorie inutili\" (\"Useless Memories\"), \"Sullo Scoglio\"  (\"On the Reefs\"), and \"Al di la, no\" (\"The Next World, No\"), revealed  such unbridled license of morbid tendencies that even Italians could not  stomach them. He appeared to them a romanticist after the manner of  Guerrazzi, addicted to the Macabre, subject to satanic inspiration,  bombastic, and rhetorical.    When Oriani took up a second phase of his writing in the period from  1880 to 1890 the reading public still continued to mistrust him.  Although he brought his spirit to a more stable equilibrium, he carried  upon himself the stigma that clung to him in consequence of his previous  books, and such productions as \"Il Nemico\" (\"The Enemy\"), \"Incenso e  Mirra\" (\"Incense and Myrrh\"), \"Fino a Dogali\" (\"Up to Dogal\"),  \"Matrimonio e divorzio\" (\"Marriage and Divorce\"), did not absolve him  from previous sins.    His turgid style was more objected to than his taints and his themes,  and his aggressiveness and political arrogances found greater opposition  than his early decadent manner and his late negations in religious  matters. He was accused of being a plagiarist. His greatest work \"Lotta  Politica\" was characterized by a critic, L. Ambrosina, to be wholly  devoid of originality. His \"Momo\" was called an imitation of  Turgenieff's \"A Neighbor's Bread.\" His \"L'Invincibile\" was derived from  \"Andrea Cornelis\" of Paul Bourget, and the \"Ultimi Barbari\" (\"The Last  Barbarians\") from Verga's \"Pagliacci\" and the \"Cavalleria Rusticana.\"    Thus beset, Oriani, despairing of recognition, gathered his strength for  a final flight and strove to reach heights never reached before, and he  wrote \"The Political Struggle,\" \"Holocaust,\" and \"Ideal Revolts.\"    \"The Holocaust\" is a study of mother and daughter. The mother has, from  leading a wayward life, been able to keep body and soul together until  middle age has effaced her charms. Reduced to hunger and rags, she  decides to sacrifice her fifteen-year-old daughter and offers her to the  first stranger whom she encounters walking beside the Arno one evening;  she takes him to her contemptible rooms where the emaciated and ragged  child awaits, in ignorance of her mission, the mother.    The young man of the self-made and aggressive type primed with animal  spirits hesitates to be the instrument of the mother's monstrous  designs, and hurls himself from the house when he realizes the  situation, leaving the contents of his purse with the crushed little  flower. The inhuman mother and a friend even more saturated in iniquity  spend the money in an improvised banquet and plan how they shall take  the child to the home of a well-known procuress. Their object is  realized when this is accomplished and the mother receives a small sum  of money, but the child, not having been cut out for the life, soon  escapes. A narrative of her experiences, a picture of her suffering, the  conflict between filial love and justifiable resentment, is set forth in  page after page of psychological analysis. From the violence of the  encounter flow simultaneously mortal disease and pregnancy. The former  gives the author an opportunity to depict the child mind in rebellion  against both bodily and spiritual salvation. The ministrations of the  church are done with great finesse, kindliness, and skill, and give much  satisfaction to believers. This may be the author's votive offering to  the church, or it may reflect a new illumination of his soul."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41958"],[0,"The Microscope (#5)"],[1,"shown to be  unfounded. The last fifteen years have sufficed to elevate the  compound microscope from the condition we have described to that of  being the most important instrument ever bestowed by art upon the  investigator of nature. It now holds a very high rank among  philosophical implements, while the transcendant beauties of form,  color and organization, which it reveals to us in the minute works of  nature, render it subservient to the most delightful and instructive  pursuits. To these claims on our attention, it appears likely to add a  third of still higher importance. The microscopic examination of the  blood and other human organic matter will in all probability afford  more satisfactory and conclusive evidence regarding the nature and  seat of disease than any hitherto appealed to, and will of consequence  lead to similar certainty in the choice and application of remedies.    We have thought it necessary to state thus at large the claims of the  modern achromatic microscope upon the attention of the reader, as a  justification of the length at which we shall give its recent history  and explain its construction; and we are further induced to this  course by the consideration that the subject is entirely new ground,  and that there are at this time not more than two or three makers of  achromatic microscopes in England.    Soon after the year 1820 a series of experiments was begun in France  by M. Selligues, which were followed up by Frauenhofer at Munich, by  Amici at Modena, by M. Chevalier at Paris, and by the late Mr. Tulley  in London. In 1824 the last-named excellent artist, without knowing  what had been done on the Continent, made the attempt to construct an  achromatic object-glass for a compound microscope, and produced one of  nine-tenths of an inch focal length, composed of three lenses, and  transmitting a pencil of eighteen degrees. This was the first that had  been made in England; and it is due to Mr. Tulley to say, that as  regards accurate correction throughout the field, that glass has not  been excelled by any subsequent combination of three lenses. Such an  angular pencil, and such a focal length, would bear an eye-piece  adapted to produce a gross magnifying power of one hundred and twenty.  Mr. Tulley afterwards made a combination to be placed in front of the  first mentioned, which increased the angle of the transmitted pencil  to thirty-eight degrees, and bore a power of three hundred.    While these practical investigations were in progress, the subject of  achromatism engaged the attention of some of the most profound  mathematicians in England. Sir John Herschel, Professor Airy,  Professor Barlow, Mr. Coddington, and others, contributed largely to  the theoretical examination of the subject; and though the results of  their labors were not immediately applicable to the microscope, they  essentially promoted its improvement.    For some time prior to 1829 the subject had occupied the mind of a  gentleman, who, not entirely practical, like the first, nor purely  mathematical, like the last-mentioned class of inquirers, was led to  the discovery of certain properties in achromatic combinations which  had been before unobserved. These were afterwards experimentally  verified; and in the year 1829 a paper on the subject, by the  discoverer, Mr. Joseph Jackson Lister, was read and published by the  Royal Society. The principles and results thus obtained enabled Mr.  Lister to form a combination of lenses which transmitted a pencil of  fifty degrees, with a large field correct in every part; as this paper  was the foundation of the recent improvements in achromatic  microscopes, and as its results are indispensable to all who would  make or understand the instrument, we shall give the more important  parts of it in detail, and in Mr. Lister's own words.    \"I would premise that the plano-concave form for the correcting flint  lens has in that quality a strong recommendation, particularly as it  obviates the danger of error which otherwise exists in centering the  two curves, and thereby admits of correct workmanship for a shorter  focus. To cement together also the two surfaces of the glass  diminishes by very nearly half the loss of light from reflection,  which is considerable at the numerous surfaces of a combination. I  have thought the clearness of the field and brightness of the picture  evidently increased by doing this; it prevents any dewiness or  vegetation from forming on the inner surfaces; and I see no  disadvantage to be anticipated from it if they are of identical  curves, and pressed closely together, and the cementing medium  permanently homogeneous.    \"These two conditions then, that the flint lens shall be  plano-concave, and that it shall be joined by some cement to the  convex, seem desirable to be taken as a basis for the microscopic  object-glass, provided they can be reconciled with the destruction of  the spherical and chromatic aberrations of a large pencil.    \"Now in every such glass that has been tried by me which has had its  correcting lens of either Swiss or English glass, with a double convex  of plate, and has been made achromatic by the form given to the outer  curve of the convex, the proportion has been such between the  refractive and dispersive powers of its lenses, that its figure has  been correct for rays issuing from some point in its axis not far from  its principal focus on its plane side, and either tending to a  conjugate focus within the tube of a microscope, or emerging nearly  parallel.    \"Let A B (Fig. 13) be supposed such an object-glass, and let it be  roughly considered as a plano-convex lens, with a curve A C B running  through it, at which the spherical and chromatic errors are corrected  which are generated at the two outer surfaces; and let the glass be  thus free from aberration for rays F D E G issuing from the radiant  point F, H E being a perpendicular to the convex surface, and I D to  the plane one. Under these circumstances, the angle of emergence G E H  much exceeds that of incidence F D I, being probably nearly three  times as great.    \"If the radiant is now made to approach the glass, so that the course  of the ray F D E G shall be more divergent from the axis, as the  angles of incidence and emergence become more nearly equal to each  other, the spherical aberration produced by the two will be found to  bear a less proportion to the opposing error of the single correcting  curve A C B; for such a focus therefore the rays will be  over-corrected.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    \"But if F still approaches the glass, the angle of incidence  continues to increase with the increasing divergence of the ray, till  it will exceed that of emergence, which has in the meanwhile been  diminishing, and at length the spherical error produced by them will  recover its original proportion to the opposite error of the curve of  correction. When F has reached this point F'' (at which the angle of  incidence does not exceed that of emergence so much as it had at first  come short of it), the rays again pass the glass free from spherical  aberration.    \"If F be carried from hence towards the glass, or outwards from its  original place, the angle of incidence in the former case, or of  emergence in the latter, becomes disproportionately effective, and  either way the aberration exceeds the correction.    \"These facts have been established by careful experiment: they accord  with every appearance in such combinations of the plano-convex glasses  as have come under my notice, and may, I believe, be extended to this  rule, that in general an achromatic object-glass, of which the inner  surfaces are in contact, or nearly so, will have on one side of it two  foci in its axis, for the rays proceeding from which it will be truly  corrected at a moderate aperture; that for the space between these two  points its spherical aberration will be over-corrected, and beyond  them either way under-corrected.    \"The longer aplanatic focus may be found, when one of the plano-convex  object-glasses is placed in a microscope, by shortening the tube, if  the glass shows over-correction; if under-correction, by lengthening  it, or by bringing the rays together, should they be parallel or  divergent, by a very small good telescope. The shorter focus is got at  by sliding the glass before another of sufficient length and large  aperture that is finely corrected, and bringing it forwards till it  gives the reflection of a bright point from a globule of quicksilver,  sharp and free from mist, when the distance can be taken between the  glass and the object.    \"The longer focus is the place at which to ascertain the utmost  aperture that may be given to the glass, and where, in the absence of  spherical error, its exact state of correction as to color is seen  most distinctly.    \"The correction of the chromatic aberration, like that of the  spherical, tends to excess in the marginal rays; so that if a glass  which is achromatic, with a moderate aperture, has its cell opened  wider, the circle of rays thus added to the pencil will be rather  over-corrected as to color.    \"The same tendency to over-correction is produced, if, without varying  the aperture, the divergence of the incident rays is much augmented,  as in an object-glass placed in front of another; but generally in  this position a part only of its aperture comes into use; so that the  two properties mentioned neutralize each other, and its chromatic  state remains unaltered. If, for example, the outstanding colors were  observed at the longer focus to be green and claret, which show that  the nearest practicable approach is made to the union of the spectrum,  they usually continue nearly the same for the whole space between the  foci, and for some distance beyond them either way.    \"The places of these two foci and their proportions to each other  depend on a variety of"]]]
