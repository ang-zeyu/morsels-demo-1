[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4511"],[0,"The Life of the Bee (#5)"],[1,"has  become thus depraved.    {13}    All things go to prove that it is not the queen, but the spirit of  the hive, that decides on the swarm. With this queen of ours it  happens as with many a chief among men, who though he appear to give  orders, is himself obliged to obey commands far more mysterious, far  more inexplicable, than those he issues to his subordinates. The  hour once fixed, the spirit will probably let it be known at break  of dawn, or the previous night, if indeed not two nights before; for  scarcely has the sun drunk in the first drops of dew when a most  unaccustomed stir, whose meaning the bee-keeper rarely will fail to  grasp, is to be noticed within and around the buzzing city. At times  one would almost appear to detect a sign of dispute, hesitation,  recoil. It will happen even that for day after day a strange  emotion, apparently without cause, will appear and vanish in this  transparent, golden throng. Has a cloud that we cannot see crept  across the sky that the bees are watching; or is their intellect  battling with a new regret? Does a winged council debate the  necessity of the departure? Of this we know nothing; as we know  nothing of the manner in which the spirit conveys its resolution to  the crowd. Certain as it may seem that the bees communicate with  each other, we know not whether this be done in human fashion. It is  possible even that their own refrain may be inaudible to them: the  murmur that comes to us heavily laden with perfume of honey, the  ecstatic whisper of fairest summer days that the bee-keeper loves so  well, the festival song of labour that rises and falls around the  hive in the crystal of the hour, and might almost be the chant of  the eager flowers, hymn of their gladness and echo of their soft  fragrance, the voice of the white carnations, the marjoram, and the  thyme. They have, however, a whole gamut of sounds that we can  distinguish, ranging from profound delight to menace, distress, and  anger; they have the ode of the queen, the song of abundance, the  psalms of grief, and, lastly, the long and mysterious war-cries the  adolescent princesses send forth during the combats and massacres  that precede the nuptial flight. May this be a fortuitous music that  fails to attain their inward silence? In any event they seem not the  least disturbed at the noises we make near the hive; but they regard  these perhaps as not of their world, and possessed of no interest  for them. It is possible that we on our side hear only a fractional  part of the sounds that the bees produce, and that they have many  harmonies to which our ears are not attuned. We soon shall see with  what startling rapidity they are able to understand each other, and  adopt concerted measures, when, for instance, the great honey thief,  the huge sphinx atropos, the sinister butterfly that bears a death's  head on its back, penetrates into the hive, humming its own strange  note, which acts as a kind of irresistible incantation; the news  spreads quickly from group to group, and from the guards at the  threshold to the workers on the furthest combs, the whole population  quivers.    {14}    It was for a long time believed that when these wise bees, generally  so prudent, so far-sighted and economical, abandoned the treasures  of their kingdom and flung themselves upon the uncertainties of  life, they were yielding to a kind of irresistible folly, a  mechanical impulse, a law of the species, a decree of nature, or to  the force that for all creatures lies hidden in the revolution of  time. It is our habit, in the case of the bees no less than our own,  to regard as fatality all that we do not as yet understand. But now  that the hive has surrendered two or three of its material secrets,  we have discovered that this exodus is neither instinctive nor  inevitable. It is not a blind emigration, but apparently the  well-considered sacrifice of the present generation in favour of the  generation to come. The bee-keeper has only to destroy in their  cells the young queens that still are inert, and, at the same time,  if nymphs and larvae abound, to enlarge the store-houses and  dormitories of the nation, for this unprofitable tumult  instantaneously to subside, for work to be at once resumed, and the  flowers revisited; while the old queen, who now is essential again,  with no successor to hope for, or perhaps to fear, will renounce for  this year her desire for the light of the sun. Reassured as to the  future of the activity that will soon spring into life, she will  tranquilly resume her maternal labours, which consist in the laying  of two or three thousand eggs a day, as she passes, in a methodical  spiral, from cell to cell, omitting none, and never pausing to rest.    Where is the fatality here, save in the love of the race of to-day  for the race of to-morrow? This fatality exists in the human species  also, but its extent and power seem infinitely less. Among men it  never gives rise to sacrifices as great, as unanimous, or as  complete. What far-seeing fatality, taking the place of this one, do  we ourselves obey? We know not; as we know not the being who watches  us as we watch the bees.    But the hive that we have selected is disturbed in its history by no  interference of man; and as the beautiful day advances with radiant  and tranquil steps beneath the trees, its ardour, still bathed in  dew, makes the appointed hour seem laggard. Over the whole surface  of the golden corridors that divide the parallel walls the workers  are busily making preparation for the journey. And each one will  first of all burden herself with provision of honey sufficient for  five or six days. From this honey that they bear within them they  will distil, by a chemical process still unexplained, the wax  required for the immediate construction of buildings. They will  provide themselves also with a certain amount of propolis, a kind of  resin with which they will seal all the crevices in the new  dwelling, strengthen weak places, varnish the walls, and exclude the  light; for the bees love to work in almost total obscurity, guiding  themselves with their many-faceted eyes, or with their antennae  perhaps, the seat, it would seem, of an unknown sense that fathoms  and measures the darkness.    {16}    They are not without prescience, therefore, of what is to befall  them on this the most dangerous day of all their existence. Absorbed  by the cares, the prodigious perils of this mighty adventure, they  will have no time now to visit the gardens and meadows; and  to-morrow, and after tomorrow, it may happen that rain may fall, or  there may be wind; that their wings may be frozen or the flowers  refuse to open. Famine and death would await them were it not for  this foresight of theirs. None would come to their help, nor would  they seek help of any. For one city knows not the other, and  assistance never is given. And even though the bee-keeper deposit  the hive, in which he has gathered the old queen and her attendant  cluster of bees, by the side of the abode they have but this moment  quitted, they would seem, be the disaster never so great that shall  now have befallen them, to have wholly forgotten the peace and the  happy activity that once they had known there, the abundant wealth  and the safety that had then been their portion; and all, one by  one, and down to the last of them, will perish of hunger and cold  around their unfortunate queen rather than return to the home of  their birth, whose sweet odour of plenty, the fragrance, indeed, of  their own past assiduous labour, reaches them even in their  distress.    {17}    That is a thing, some will say, that men would not do,--a proof that  the bee, notwithstanding the marvels of its organisation, still is  lacking in intellect and veritable consciousness. Is this so  certain? Other beings, surely, may possess an intellect that differs  from ours, and produces different results, without therefore being  inferior. And besides, are we, even in this little human parish of  ours, such infallible judges of matters that pertain to the spirit?  Can we so readily divine the thoughts that may govern the two or  three people we may chance to see moving and talking behind a closed  window, when their words do not reach us? Or let us suppose that an  inhabitant of Venus or Mars were to contemplate us from the height  of a mountain, and watch the little black specks that we form in  space, as we come and go in the streets and squares of our towns.  Would the mere sight of our movements, our buildings, machines, and  canals, convey to him any precise idea of our morality, intellect,  our manner of thinking, and loving, and hoping,--in a word, of our  real and intimate self? All he could do, like ourselves when we gaze  at the hive, would be to take note of some facts that seem very  surprising; and from these facts to deduce conclusions probably no  less erroneous, no less uncertain, than those that we choose to form  concerning the bee.    This much at least is certain; our \"little black specks\" would not  reveal the vast moral direction, the wonderful unity, that are so  apparent in the hive. \"Whither do they tend, and what is it they do?\"  he would ask, after years and centuries of patient watching. \"What  is the aim of their life, or its pivot? Do they obey some God? I can  see nothing that governs their actions. The little things that one  day they appear to collect and build up, the next they destroy and  scatter. They come and they go, they meet and disperse, but one  knows not what it is they seek. In numberless cases the spectacle  they present is altogether inexplicable. There are some, for  instance, who, as it were, seem scarcely to stir from their place.  They are to be distinguished by their glossier coat, and often too  by their more considerable bulk. They occupy buildings ten or twenty  times larger than ordinary dwellings, and richer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#5)"],[1,"that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take      my offering.        \"And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and      silver, and brass,        \"And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,        \"And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,        \"Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,        \"Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the      breastplate.        \"And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.        \"According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of {22} the      tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so      shall ye make it.\"[7]    The response of the people was so liberal and prompt that a surplus of  material was soon amassed.        \"And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than      enough for the service of the work, which the Lord commanded to      make.        \"And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed      throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any      more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were      restrained from bringing.        \"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it,      and too much.\"[8]    Divine direction was manifest in the appointment of men who should be  in charge of the labor. Bezaleel, the son of Uri, and Aholiab, the son  of Ahisamach, were designated by revelation as the master craftsmen  under whose direction the other workers should labor until all had  been finished in direct accord with the revealed pattern and plan. And  when so finished it was the embodiment of the best in material and  workmanship.    The Tabernacle stood in an outer enclosure or court, walled in by  canvas screens with entrance curtains finely embroidered. The curtains  that formed the walls of the court were suspended from pillars, which  stood at intervals along the sides of an oblong. The longer walls ran  east and west, with the main entrance to the enclosure on {23} the  eastern side. Of the two squares within the curtains, the easterly was  reserved for assemblies of the people, while the square to the west  constituted the more sacred area pertaining to the Tabernacle itself.    The entire space so enclosed covered one hundred cubits east and  west and fifty cubits north and south, or approximately one hundred  and fifty feet by seventy-five feet.[9] In the easterly section,  and therefore removed from the Tabernacle, stood the altar of  burnt-offerings. Between the altar and the Tabernacle stood the  laver; this was a large vessel of brass standing upon a pedestal and  containing water for the ceremonial cleansing of the hands and feet  of the priests. It is interesting to note that the laver and its  supporting pedestal were made by special contribution of the women,  who gave their brazen mirrors for this purpose. The Tabernacle stood  with its longer axis east and west, and with its entrance on the  easterly side. The structure was but thirty cubits long by ten cubits  broad, or forty-five by fifteen feet; these are the dimensions given  by Josephus, and they are practically in accord with the description  in Exodus, which states that the walls comprised twenty boards on a  side, each board one and a half cubits wide; at the west end there were  six boards, each one and a half cubits wide or nine cubits in all;  these with the angle posts would make the entire breadth equal to that  given by Josephus, ten cubits. The boards of the walls {24} were held  together by tenon-joints having sockets of silver, two to each board;  the boards themselves were overlaid with gold and were provided with  rings of the same metal to receive the bars, which also were overlaid  with gold.    It will be seen that the Tabernacle was but a small structure, entirely  unsuited to the accommodation of large assemblies, but it is to be  remembered that for such it was never intended. Within the Tabernacle,  only the appointed bearers of the Priesthood officiated; and of these  none but the few actually engaged in the service of the day could be  admitted.    The Tabernacle was divided by a curtain, specifically called the Veil,  into two compartments, the outer of which was known as the Holy Place,  and the inner as the Most Holy Place or Holy of Holies. Josephus and  some others state that the Tabernacle comprised three parts; the third  division, however, was really outside the main tent and appeared as  a porch at the east end, five cubits deep, and extending across the  entire front. The Veil, which separated the Holy Place from the Holy  of Holies, was of fine workmanship, \"of blue, and purple, and scarlet,  and fine twined linen of cunning work,\" and was embroidered with  cherubim. It was hung upon four pillars of wood overlaid with gold;  the hooks were of gold and the sockets of silver. The wood used for  these pillars, as indeed that used in other parts of the structure, was  the rare, costly, and durable shittim or acacia, sometimes known as  thorn-wood. Beyond the Veil the enclosure was most holy, and therein  was placed the Ark of the Covenant with its Mercy Seat bearing the  sacred cherubim, the description of which appears in the record as  follows:        {25} \"And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a      half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of      it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:        \"And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a      crown of gold to it round about.        \"And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four      corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two      rings upon the other side of it.        \"And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.        \"And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to      bear the ark.        \"And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was      the length thereof, and one cubit and half the breadth thereof.        \"And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he      them, on the two ends of the mercy seat:        \"One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the      other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims      on the two ends thereof.        \"And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with      their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;      even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.\"[10]    Outside the Veil, yet within the Tabernacle, was the Holy Place; in  this were placed the table of shewbread, the altar of incense, and the  golden seven-branched candlestick.[11]    The rich fabrics of delicate workmanship forming the walls and roof  of the Tabernacle were protected by coarser hangings of goats' hair,  and these in turn by a covering of skins. The structure as completed  is referred to in the scripture sometimes as the Tent of the {26}  Congregation and at others as the Tabernacle of the Congregation; the  former expression occurs thirteen times, the latter one hundred and  thirty-three times; yet notwithstanding this difference, the original  in each case was _Ohel Moed_, the best authenticated translation of  which is the Tent of Meeting. Let it not be supposed, however, that  this means in the ordinary sense a meeting-house, for the meeting here  expressed is not that of a concourse of worshippers, but the place of  communion between God and His Priesthood. The Tent of Meeting, or the  Tabernacle of the Congregation, in Israel, was the Lord's tent wherein  He met the authorized representatives of His people.    On the first day of the second year following Israel's exodus from  Egypt, the Tabernacle was set up for the first time, and all the sacred  furniture was disposed according to the direct commands of the Lord.  The veil was hung, and the place was consecrated as a most holy spot,  ineffably sacred as the dwelling place of Jehovah. Then, even as on  Sinai a cloud had shrouded the temporary abiding place of God, so was  it with the Tabernacle:        \"Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory      of the Lord filled the tabernacle.        \"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,      because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled      the tabernacle.        \"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the      children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:        \"But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till      the day that it was taken up.        \"For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by {27} day, and      fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,      throughout all their journeys.\"[12]    The all-pervading and all-controlling thought in the erection of  this portable sanctuary was that of expressing the close association  between Jehovah and His people. The people were to consider themselves  specifically the people of God, and amongst them should be His  dwelling, surpassing in a transcendent degree the presence of the gods  of wood and stone housed among the idolatrous nations with whom Israel  had to contend. This thought was expressed in the earliest commandment  respecting the building of the Tabernacle: \"And let them make me a  sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.\"[13]    Even more truly indispensable than Tabernacle or Temple, in the  maintenance of close relationship with Deity, is the Priesthood. It  was therefore to be expected that with the establishment of a holy  sanctuary, appointments and ordinations should be made whereby men  would be truly set apart to the sacred offices of the Priesthood. While  Moses was the great high priest of Israel, standing at the head of a  distinctive dispensation of Divine "]]]
