Dfar-Lll looked at Jrann-Pttt.    Professor Bernardi coughed. \"That was the only spaceship we had,\" he  admitted. \"The first experimental model, you know.\" _We don't expect to  stay on this awful planet forever. After all, as Louisa says, the  government will have to forgive us. Public opinion and all that._    \"Oh,\" the saurian said. \"Then we shall have the pleasure of your company  until they build another?\"    There was silence. \"We have the only plans,\" the professor said,  gripping his briefcase more tightly. \"I am the inventor of the ship, so  naturally I would have them.\" _If we brought back some specimens of  Venusian life--of intelligent Venusian life--to prove we'd been  here...._    \"Matter of fact, old fellow,\" Mortland said, \"we took all the plans with  us so they couldn't build another ship and follow--\"    \"Mortland!\" the professor exclaimed.    \"But they're telepaths,\" Miss Anspacher said. \"They must know already.\"    Everyone turned to look at the saurians.    \"I have ... certain information,\" Jrann-Pttt admitted, \"but I cannot  understand it. You are in trouble with your rulers because they would  not give you the funds, claiming space travel was impossible?\"    \"That's right,\" Bernardi said. _Not really specimens, you understand.  Guests._    \"And you went ahead and appropriated the funds and materials from your  government, since you were in a trusted position where you could do so?\"    Bernardi nodded.    \"Of course the question is now academic, for the ship is gone, but since  you proved the possibility of space travel by coming here, wouldn't your  government then dismiss the charges against you?\"    \"That's exactly what I keep telling him!\" Mrs. Bernardi exclaimed.    But her husband shook his head. \"The law is inflexible. We have broken  it and must be punished, even if by breaking it we proved its  fundamental error.\" _Why let him know our plans?_    _Why, Jrann-Pttt, that sounds just like our own government, doesn't it?_    _Yes, it does. We should be able to establish a very satisfactory mode  of living with these strangers._    \"We'd hoped that after a year or so the whole thing would die down,\"  Mortland explained frankly, \"and we'd go back as heroes.\"    \"Do you know the way to your home, Jrann-Pttt?\" the professor asked  anxiously.    \"Since we were able to catch a glimpse of the sun, I think I can figure  out roughly where we are. All we must do is walk some two hundred  kilometers in that direction--\" he waved an arm to indicate the  way--\"and we should be at the capital.\"    \"Will your people accept us as refugees?\" Miss Anspacher demanded  bluntly, \"or will we be captives?\" _Which is what I'll bet the good  professor is planning for you, if only he can figure some way to get you  and, of course, ourselves back._    \"We should be proud to accept you as citizens and to receive the  benefits of your splendid technology. Our laboratories will be placed at  your disposal.\"    \"Well, that's better than we hoped for,\" the professor said,  brightening. \"We had expected to have to carve our own laboratories out  of the wilderness. Now we shall be able to carry on our researches in  comfort.\" _No need to trouble the natives; we'll be able to raise the  ship ourselves. Or build a new one. And I'll see to it personally that  they have special quarters in the zoo with a considerable amount of  privacy._    \"If I were you, I wouldn't trust him too far,\" the captain warned. \"He's  a foreigner.\"    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Captain!\" Miss Anspacher said.  \"I, for one, trust Jrann-Pttt implicitly. Did you say this direction,  Jrann-Pttt?\" She stepped forward briskly. There was a loud splash and  water closed over her head.    Captain Greenfield rushed forward to haul her out. \"Well,\" she said,  daintily coughing up mud, \"I was wet to begin with, anyway.\"    \"You're a brave little woman, Miss Anspacher,\" the captain told her  admiringly.    \"This sort of thing may present a problem,\" Professor Bernardi  commented. \"I hope that was only a pot-hole, that the water is not going  to be consistently too deep for wading.\"    \"There might be quicksand, too,\" Mrs. Bernardi said somberly. \"In  quicksand, one drowns slowly.\"    Dfar-Lll gave a start. _Surely you don't intend to lead them back to  base?_    _Precisely. The swamp is unfit for settlement._    _But to return voluntarily to captivity?_    _Who mentioned anything about captivity? Assisted by our new friends, we  have an excellent chance of taking over the ship and supplies by a  surprise attack._    _But why should these aliens assist us?_    Jrann-Pttt smiled. _Oh, I think they will. Yes, I have every confidence  in Plan C._    \"I suggest,\" the professor said, ignoring his wife's pessimism, \"that  each one of us pull a branch from a tree. We can test the ground before  we step on it, to make sure that there is solid footing underneath.\"    \"Good idea,\" the captain approved. He reached out the arm that was not  occupied with Miss Anspacher and tugged at a tree limb.    And then he and the lady physicist were both floundering in the ooze.    \"Well, really, Captain Greenfield!\" she cried, refusing his aid in  extricating herself. \"I always thought you were at least a gentleman in  spite of your illiteracy!\"    \"Wha--what happened?\" he asked as he struggled out of the mud.  \"Something pushed me; I swear it.\"    Jrann-Pttt mentalized. \"It seems the tree did not like your trying to  remove a branch.\"    \"The tree!\" Greenfield's pale blue eyes bulged. \"You're joking!\"    \"Not at all. As a matter of fact, I myself have been wondering why there  were so many thought-streams and yet so few animals around here. It  never occurred to me that the vegetation could be sentient and have such  strong emotive defenses. In all my experience as a botanist, I--\"    \"I thought you were a zoologist,\" Bernardi interrupted.    \"My people do not believe in excessive specialization,\" the saurian  replied.    \"Trees that think?\" Mortland inquired incredulously.    \"They're not very bright,\" Jrann-Pttt explained, \"but they don't like  having their limbs pulled off. I don't suppose you would, either, for  that matter.\"    \"I propose,\" Miss Anspacher said, shaking out her wet hair, \"that we  break up the camp stools and use the sticks instead of branches to help  us along.\"    \"Good idea,\" the captain said, trying to get back into her good graces.  \"I always knew women could put their brains to use if they tried.\"    She glared at him.    \"I thought we'd use the furniture to make a fire later,\" Mortland  complained. \"For tea, you know.\"    \"The ground's much too wet,\" Professor Bernardi replied.    \"And besides,\" Miss Anspacher added, \"I lost the teapot in that  pot-hole.\"    \"But you managed to save the _Proceedings of the Physical Society_,\"  Mortland snarled. \"Serve you right if I eat it. And I warn you, if  hard-pressed, I shall.\"    \"How will we cook our food, though?\" Mrs. Bernardi demanded  apprehensively. \"It's a lucky thing, Mr. Pitt, that we have you with us  to tell us which of the berries and things are edible, so at least we  shan't starve.\"    The visible portion of Jrann-Pttt's well-knit form turned deeper green.  \"But I regret to say I don't know, Mrs. Bernardi. Those 'native' foods I  served you were all synthetics from our personal stores. I never tasted  natural foods before I met you.\"    \"And if the trees don't like our taking their branches,\" Miss Anspacher  put in, \"I don't suppose the bushes would like our taking their berries.  Louisa, don't do that!\"    But Mrs. Bernardi, with her usual disregard for orders, had fainted into  the mud. Pulling her out and reviving her caused so much confusion, it  wasn't until then that they discovered Algol had disappeared.           *       *       *       *       *    The party had been trudging through mud and water and struggling with  pale, malevolent vines and bushes and low-hanging branches for close to  six Earth hours. All of them were tired and hungry, now that their  meager supply of biscuits and chocolate was gone.    \"Remember, Carl,\" Mrs. Bernardi told her husband, \"I forgive you. And I  know I'm being foolishly sentimental, but if you could manage to take my  body back to Earth--\"    \"Don't be so pessimistic.\" Professor Bernardi absent-mindedly leaned  against a tree, then recoiled as he remembered it might resent being  treated like an inanimate object. \"In any case, we'll most likely all  die at the same time.\"    \"I never did want to go to Venus, really,\" Mrs. Bernardi sniffled. \"I  only came, like Algol did, because I didn't have any choice. If you left  me behind, I'd have had to bear the brunt of.... Where is Algol?\" She  stared at Jrann-Pttt. \"You were carrying him. What have you done with  him?\"    The lizard-man looked at her in consternation. \"He jumped out of my arms  when you fainted and I turned back to help. I was certain one of the  others had him.\"    \"He's dead!\" she wailed. \"You let him fall into the water and drown--an  innocent kitty that never hurt anybody, except in fun.\"    \"Come, come, Louisa.\" Her husband took her arm. \"He was only a cat. I'm  sure Jrann-Pttt didn't mean for him to drown. He was just so upset by  your fainting that he didn't think....\"    \"Not Jrann-Pttt's fault, of course,\" Miss Anspacher said.    \"After all, we can't expect them to love animals as we do. But Algol was  a very good sort of cat....\"    \"Keep quiet, all of you!\" Jrann-Pttt shouted. \"I have never known any  species to use any method of communication so much in order to  communicate so little. Don't you understand? I would not have assumed  the cat was with one of you, if I had not subconsciously sensed his  thought-stream all along. He must be nearby.\"    Everyone was still, while Jrann-Pttt probed the dense underbrush that  blocked their view on both sides. \"Over here,\" he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],[0,"What Bird is That?

L. 6-3/4.              _Range._ Tropical and subtemperate parts of the            Western Hemisphere. Our form is found in Florida            and on the coast region from North Carolina to            Texas.              Washington, accidental; two records, Sept., Oct.    This dainty, miniature Pigeon is common in southern gardens and old  fields. It runs gracefully before one, and when flushed rises with a  whirring flight but soon alights, usually on the ground. Its call is a  crooning _coo_. The nest is placed on the ground and in low trees and  bushes. Two white eggs are laid in March.          BIRDS OF PREY. ORDER RAPTORES          AMERICAN VULTURES. FAMILY CATHARTIDAE      TURKEY VULTURE    _Cathartes aura septentrionalis. Case 3, Fig. 9_              Head red, plumage with a brownish cast. Young            birds have the head covered with brownish down. L.            30.              _Range._ Most of the Western Hemisphere in several            subspecies; in the eastern states north to            northern New Jersey and, locally, southern New            York. Migrating south from the northern part of            its range.              Washington, abundant P.R. Ossining, A.V.            Cambridge, casual, two records. N. Ohio, tolerably            common S.R., Mch. 5-Oct. 30. SE. Minn., common            S.R., Apl. 27.    The 'Turkey Buzzard' has a wider wing-stretch and is a better aviator  than the Black Vulture. It is more a bird of the country than the  last-named species which is the common Vulture of the streets in many  southern cities. Extremely graceful in the air, it is far from pleasing  when at rest. The two dull white, brown-marked eggs are laid on the  ground under logs, in crevices in rocks, etc., in March in Florida, in  April in Virginia.      BLACK VULTURE    _Catharista urubu urubu. Case 3, Fig. 10_              Head black, plumage without the brownish cast of            the Turkey Vulture.              _Range._ Eastern U.S., north to Virginia; an            abundant Permanent Resident. Washington, casual,            Mch., July, Dec.    The Vulture of southern cities; a frequenter of slaughter houses and  markets. In flight the under surfaces of the wing look silvery. It is by  no means so impressive a figure in the air as the Turkey Vulture. Two  pale bluish white eggs, generally with brown markings, are laid on the  ground under logs, bushes, palmettoes, etc., in March and April.          HAWKS, EAGLES, KITES, ETC. FAMILY BUTEONIDAE      SWALLOW-TAILED KITE    _Elanoides forficatus forficatus_              The head and lower parts are white, the rest of            the plumage glossy black; the tail deeply forked.            L. 24.              _Range._ Florida to South Carolina, and up the            Mississippi Valley rarely to Saskatchewan; winters            south of the United States, returning in March.              Washington, three records, Aug.; Apl. SE. Minn.,            uncommon S.R., May 4.    Color, form, grace, and power of motion combine to make the flight of  the Swallow-tail an impressive demonstration of the bird's mastery of  the air. It feeds on lizards and small snakes which it captures when on  the wing from the branches of trees. The nest is placed in the upper  branches of tall trees, 2-3 eggs heavily marked with brown being laid in  Florida in April; in Iowa in June.      WHITE-TAILED KITE    _Elanus leucurus_              A gray bird with white underparts, rather short            white tail and black shoulders. L. 15-1/2.              _Range._ Chiefly southwestern United States and            southward east to the lower Mississippi Valley.    This is a rare bird east of the Mississippi. It frequents open marshy  places and feeds upon small snakes, lizards, grasshoppers, etc., which  it captures on the ground. The nest is built in trees, and the 3-5 eggs,  heavily marked with brown, are laid in May.      MISSISSIPPI KITE    _Ictinia mississippiensis_              A slaty-blue bird with black tail and wings and            red eyes. L. 14.              _Range._ Southern United States, north to South            Carolina, and southern Indiana; winters chiefly            south of the United States and returns in April.    A low-flying hunter of insects, snakes and frogs. It migrates in loose  flocks sometimes near the earth, at others far above it. The nest is  placed in tall trees. The eggs are laid in May; they number 1-3, and are  dull white, occasionally with a bluish tinge.      EVERGLADE KITE    _Rostrhamus sociabilis_              A dark slate-colored bird with a white rump and a            rather slender hooked bill. The young are quite            different; black above, tipped with reddish brown,            below mottled and barred with black, reddish brown            and buff, but with the white rump-patch of the            adult. L. 18.              _Range._ Tropical America north to southern            Florida.    The Everglade Kite is found in marshes and about lakes and ponds hunting  for its favorite food of large snails, which it extracts from their  shells by means of its hooked bill. It is rarely seen north of southern  Florida. The nest is placed in bushes or among reeds. The 2-3 eggs,  which are heavily marked with brown, are laid in March.      MARSH HAWK    _Circus hudsonius. Case 3, Fig. 15_              The immature bird and adult female are dark brown            above, reddish brown below, but, in any plumage,            the species may be known by the white upper            tail-coverts which show clearly in flight. L.,            male, 19; female, 22.              _Range._ North America, wintering from New Jersey            southward; migrates northward in March.              Washington, common W.V., July-Apl. Ossining,            tolerably common S.R., Mch. 6-Oct. 30; a few            winter. Cambridge, common T.V., Mch. 20-Nov. 10,            one breeding record. N. Ohio, not common S.R.,            Mch. 5-Nov. 30. Glen Ellyn, S.R., several pairs,            Apl. 4-Nov. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 6-Nov.            1.    The Marsh Hawk quarters low over the fields turning sharply here and  there to follow the course of a meadow mouse in the grass forest below.  As a rule the bird is silent but in the mating season he repeats a  'screeching' note. The nest is made on the ground in the marshes; the  4-6 white eggs are laid in May.      SHARP-SHINNED HAWK    _Accipiter velox. Case 1, Figs. 11, 12; Case 3, Figs. 7, 8_              The sexes differ only in size, the female being            much the larger. There is a marked difference in            color between adult and immature birds, the latter            being more commonly seen. L. male, 11-1/4; female,            13-1/2.              _Range._ North America; wintering from            Massachusetts southward.              Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, common T.V., Apl. 3-May 11; Sept.            5-Oct. 25; rare S.R., uncommon W.V. N. Ohio, not            common P.R., a few winter. Glen Ellyn, not common            S.R., Mch. 19-Dec. 9. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch.            28-Dec 28.    This small, bird-killing Hawk dashes recklessly after its victims,  following them through thick cover. It is less often seen in the open  than the Sparrow Hawk, which it resembles in size, but from which it may  be known by its different color, longer tail, and much shorter wings. It  nests in trees 15-40 feet from the ground. The eggs, 3-6 in number, are  bluish white or cream, marked with brown and are laid in May.    [Illustration: SHARP-SHINNED HAWK.    Note the Long Tail.]      COOPER'S HAWK    _Accipiter cooperi. Case 1, Figs. 9, 10_              A large edition of the Sharp-shinned Hawk, with            the tail more rounded, the adult with a darker            crown. L. male, 15-1/2; female, 19.              _Range._ Nests throughout United States; winters            from southern New England southward.              Washington, common S.R., less common W.V.            Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, common            T.V., not uncommon S.R., rare W.V., Apl. 10-Oct.            20. N. Ohio, not common, Mch. 20-Nov. 1; a few            winter. Glen Ellyn, local S.R., a few winter. SE.            Minn., common S.R., Mch. 3.    This is the real 'Chicken Hawk,' but it is less often seen and heard  than the soaring, screaming Buteos to which the name is usually applied.  It resembles the Sharp-shinned in habits but being larger may prey on  larger birds. The female may be easily distinguished from the  Sharp-shinned by her larger size, but the male is not appreciably larger  than a female Sharp-shin.    The nest is built in a tree 25-50 feet up. The bluish white, rarely  spotted eggs are laid in late April or early May.      GOSHAWK    _Astur atricapillus_              The adult is blue-gray above with a darker crown            and a white line over the eye. The underparts are            finely and beautifully marked with gray and white.            Young birds resemble the young of Cooper's Hawk,            but are much larger. L., male, 22; female, 24.              _Range._ North America, nests chiefly north of the            United States and winters southward, usually            rarely, as far as Virginia.              Washington, casual in winter. Ossining, rare W.V.,            Oct. 10-Jan. 14. Cambridge, irregular and uncommon            W.V. SE. Minn., W.R., Nov. 5-Apl. 4.    Like its smaller relatives the Sharp-shin and Cooper's Hawks, this  powerful raptor is a relentless hunter of birds. It is particularly  destructive to Ruffed Grouse. Fortunately it does not often visit us in  numbers. It nests in trees, laying 2-5 white eggs, rarely marked with  brownish,"]]]
