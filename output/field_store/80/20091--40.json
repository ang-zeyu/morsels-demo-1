A year  after my return to Manchester I became a candidate for the Board of Poor  Law Guardians. Several weeks before, I had contested unsuccessfully for  a place on the school board. This time, however, I was elected, heading  the poll by a very large majority.    For the benefit of American readers I shall explain something of the  operation of our English Poor Law. The duty of the law is to administer  an act of Queen Elizabeth, one of the greatest reforms effected by that  wise and humane monarch. When Elizabeth came to the throne she found  England, the Merrie England of contemporary poets, in a state of  appalling poverty. Hordes of people were literally starving to death, in  wretched hovels, in the streets, and at the very gates of the palace.  The cause of all this misery was the religious reformation under Henry  VIII, and the secession from Rome of the English Church. King Henry, it  is known, seized all the Church lands, the abbeys and the convents, and  gave them as rewards to those nobles and favourites who had supported  his policies. But in taking over the Church's property the Protestant  nobles by no means assumed the Church's ancient responsibilities of  lodging wayfarers, giving alms, nursing the sick, educating youths, and  caring for the young and the superannuated. When the monks and the nuns  were turned out of their convents these duties devolved on no one. The  result, after the brief reign of Edward VI and the bloody one of Queen  Mary, was the social anarchy inherited by Elizabeth.    This great queen and great woman, perceiving that the responsibility for  the poor and the helpless rightfully rests on the community, caused an  act to be passed creating in the parishes public bodies to deal with  local conditions of poverty. The Board of Poor Law Guardians disburses  for the poor the money coming from the Poor Rates (taxes), and some  additional moneys allowed by the local government board, the president  of which is a cabinet minister. Mr. John Burns is the present incumbent  of the office. The Board of Guardians has control of the institution we  call the workhouse. You have, I believe, almshouses, or poorhouses, but  they are not quite so extensive as our workhouses, which are all kinds  of institutions in one. We had, in my workhouse, a hospital with nine  hundred beds, a school with several hundred children, a farm, and many  workshops.    When I came into office I found that the law in our district, Chorlton,  was being very harshly administered. The old board had been made up of  the kind of men who are known as rate savers. They were guardians, not  of the poor but of the rates, and, as I soon discovered, not very astute  guardians even of money. For instance, although the inmates were being  very poorly fed, a frightful waste of food was apparent. Each inmate was  given each day a certain weight of food, and bread formed so much of the  ration that hardly anyone consumed all of his portion. In the farm  department pigs were kept on purpose to consume this surplus of bread,  and as pigs do not thrive on a solid diet of stale bread the animals  fetched in the market a much lower price than properly fed farm pigs. I  suggested that, instead of giving a solid weight of bread in one lump,  the loaf be cut in slices and buttered with margarine, each person being  allowed all that he cared to eat. The rest of the board objected, saying  that our poor charges were very jealous of their rights, and would  suspect in such an innovation an attempt to deprive them of a part of  their ration. This was easily overcome by the suggestion that we consult  the inmates before we made the change. Of course the poor people  consented, and with the bread that we saved we made puddings with milk  and currants, to be fed to the old people of the workhouse. These old  folks I found sitting on backless forms, or benches. They had no  privacy, no possessions, not even a locker. The old women were without  pockets in their gowns, so they were obliged to keep any poor little  treasures they had in their bosoms. Soon after I took office we gave the  old people comfortable Windsor chairs to sit in, and in a number of ways  we managed to make their existence more endurable.    These, after all, were minor benefits. But it does gratify me when I  look back and remember what we were able to do for the children of the  Manchester workhouse. The first time I went into the place I was  horrified to see little girls seven and eight years old on their knees  scrubbing the cold stones of the long corridors. These little girls were  clad, summer and winter, in thin cotton frocks, low in the neck and  short sleeved. At night they wore nothing at all, night dresses being  considered too good for paupers. The fact that bronchitis was epidemic  among them most of the time had not suggested to the guardians any  change in the fashion of their clothes. There was a school for the  children, but the teaching was of the poorest order. They were forlorn  enough, these poor innocents, when I first met them. In five years' time  we had changed the face of the earth for them. We had bought land in the  country and had built a cottage system home for the children, and we had  established for them a modern school with trained teachers. We had even  secured for them a gymnasium and a swimming-bath. I may say that I was  on the building committee of the board, the only woman member.    Whatever may be urged against the English Poor Law system, I maintain  that under it no stigma of pauperism need be applied to workhouse  children. If they are treated like paupers of course they will be  paupers, and they will grow up paupers, permanent burdens on society;  but if they are regarded merely as children under the guardianship of  the state, they assume quite another character. Rich children are not  pauperized by being sent to one or another of the free public schools  with which England is blest. Yet a great many of those schools, now  exclusively used for the education of upper middle-class boys, were  founded by legacies left to educate the poor--girls as well as boys. The  English Poor Law, properly administered, ought to give back to the  children of the destitute what the upper classes have taken from them, a  good education on a self-respecting basis.    The trouble is, as I soon perceived after taking office, the law cannot,  in existing circumstances, do all the work, even for children, that it  was intended to do. We shall have to have new laws, and it soon became  apparent to me that we can never hope to get them until women have the  vote. During the time I served on the board, and for years since then,  women guardians all over the country have striven in vain to have the  law reformed in order to ameliorate conditions which break the hearts of  women to see, but which apparently affect men very little. I have spoken  of the little girls I found scrubbing the workhouse floors. There were  others at the hateful labour who aroused my keenest pity. I found that  there were pregnant women in that workhouse, scrubbing floors, doing the  hardest kind of work, almost until their babies came into the world.  Many of them were unmarried women, very, very young, mere girls. These  poor mothers were allowed to stay in the hospital after confinement for  a short two weeks. Then they had to make a choice of staying in the  workhouse and earning their living by scrubbing and other work, in  which case they were separated from their babies; or of taking their  discharges. They could stay and be paupers, or they could leave--leave  with a two-weeks-old baby in their arms, without hope, without home,  without money, without anywhere to go. What became of those girls, and  what became of their hapless infants? That question was at the basis of  the women guardians' demand for a reform of one part of the Poor Law.    That section deals with the little children who are boarded out, not by  the workhouse, but by the parents, that parent being almost always the  mother. It is from that class of workhouse mothers--mostly young servant  girls--which thoughtless people say all working girls ought to be; it is  from that class more than from any other that cases of illegitimacy  come. Those poor little servant girls, who can get out perhaps only in  the evening, whose minds are not very cultivated, and who find all the  sentiment of their lives in cheap novelettes, fall an easy prey to those  who have designs against them. These are the people by whom the babies  are mostly put out to nurse, and the mothers have to pay for their keep.  Of course the babies are very badly protected. The Poor Law Guardians  are supposed to protect them by appointing inspectors to visit the homes  where the babies are boarded. But, under the law, if a man who ruins a  girl pays down a lump sum of twenty pounds, less than a hundred dollars,  the boarding home is immune from inspection. As long as a baby-farmer  takes only one child at a time, the twenty pounds being paid, the  inspectors cannot inspect the house. Of course the babies die with  hideous promptness, often long before the twenty pounds have been spent,  and then the baby-farmers are free to solicit another victim. For years,  as I have said, women have tried in vain to get that one small reform of  the Poor Law, to reach and protect all illegitimate children, and to  make it impossible for any rich scoundrel to escape future liability for  his child because of the lump sum he has paid down. Over and over again  it has been tried, but it has always failed, because the ones who really  care about the thing are mere women.    I thought I had been a suffragist before I became a Poor Law Guardian,  but now I began to think about the vote in women's hands not only as a  right but as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#5)"],[1,"principle of the rules of conduct, both in act  and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been  the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions  of their temporal masters, or of their gods. This servility, though  essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly  genuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made men burn magicians and  heretics. Among so many baser influences, the general and obvious  interests of society have of course had a share, and a large one, in the  direction of the moral sentiments: less, however, as a matter of reason,  and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and  antipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies which  had little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have made  themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great  force.    The likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion of  it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules  laid down for general observance, under the penalties of law or  opinion. And in general, those who have been in advance of society in  thought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed in  principle, however they may have come into conflict with it in some of  its details. They have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what  things society ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its  likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals. They preferred  endeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular points  on which they were themselves heretical, rather than make common cause  in defence of freedom, with heretics generally. The only case in which  the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with  consistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that of  religious belief: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as  forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called  the moral sense: for the _odium theologicum_, in a sincere bigot, is one  of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. Those who first broke  the yoke of what called itself the Universal Church, were in general as  little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church  itself. But when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a  complete victory to any party, and each church or sect was reduced to  limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already  occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming  majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they  could not convert, for permission to differ. It is accordingly on this  battle-field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against  society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim  of society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted.  The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it  possesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible  right, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others  for his religious belief. Yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in  whatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardly  anywhere been practically realised, except where religious indifference,  which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, has  added its weight to the scale. In the minds of almost all religious  persons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration is  admitted with tacit reserves. One person will bear with dissent in  matters of church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate  everybody, short of a Papist or a Unitarian; another, every one who  believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little  further, but stop at the belief in a God and in a future state. Wherever  the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found  to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed.    In England, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history,  though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter,  than in most other countries of Europe; and there is considerable  jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive  power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the  independence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of  looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the  public. The majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the  government their power, or its opinions their opinions. When they do so,  individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the  government, as it already is from public opinion. But, as yet, there is  a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any  attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have  not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very  little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the  legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly  salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well  grounded in the particular instances of its application. There is, in  fact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety of  government interference is customarily tested. People decide according  to their personal preferences. Some, whenever they see any good to be  done, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government  to undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount  of social evil, rather than add one to the departments of human  interests amenable to governmental control. And men range themselves on  one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general  direction of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interest  which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the  government should do, or according to the belief they entertain that the  government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but  very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere,  as to what things are fit to be done by a government. And it seems to me  that in consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side is  at present as often wrong as the other; the interference of government  is, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperly  condemned.    The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as  entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the  individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used  be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion  of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which  mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with  the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That  the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any  member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to  others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient  warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it  will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier,  because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even  right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning  with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling  him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify  that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be  calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the  conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which  concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his  independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and  mind, the individual is sovereign.    It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to  apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are  not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the  law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a  state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected  against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the  same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of  society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The  early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that  there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler  full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any  expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable.  Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with  barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means  justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has  no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind  have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.  Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar  or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. But as soon  as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own  improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in  all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion,  either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for  non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good,  and justifiable only for the security of others.    It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived  to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent  of utility. I"]]]
