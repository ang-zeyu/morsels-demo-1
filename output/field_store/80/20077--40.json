[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#5)"],[1,"(Hr. x.) describes the notions of the Ebionites of Nabatha, Moabitis, and  Basanitis with regard to Adam and Jesus, almost in the very words of Sura  iii. 52. He tells us that they observed circumcision, were opposed to  celibacy, forbad turning to the sunrise, but enjoined Jerusalem as their  Kebla (as did Muhammad during twelve years), that they prescribed (as did the  Sabeites), washings, very similar to those enjoined in the Koran, and allowed  oaths (by certain natural objects, as clouds, signs of the Zodiac, oil, the  winds, etc.), which we find adopted in the Koran. These points of contact  with Islam, knowing as we do Muhammad's eclecticism, can hardly be  accidental.    We have no evidence that Muhammad had access to the Christian Scriptures,  though it is just possible that fragments of the Old or New Testament may  have reached him through Chadijah or Waraka, or other Meccan Christians,  possessing MSS. of the sacred volume. There is but one direct quotation (Sura  xxi. 105) in the whole Koran from the Scriptures; and though there are a few  passages, as where alms are said to be given to be seen of men, and as, none  forgiveth sins but God only, which might seem to be identical with texts of  the New Testament, yet this similarity is probably merely accidental. It is,  however, curious to compare such passages as Deut. xxvi. 14, 17; 1 Peter v.  2, with Sura xxiv. 50, p. 448, and x. 73, p. 281 John vii. 15, with the  \"illiterate\" ProphetMatt. xxiv. 36, and John xii. 27, with the use of the  word hour as meaning any judgment or crisis, and The last judgmentthe voice  of the Son of God which the dead are to hear, with the exterminating or  awakening cry of Gabriel, etc. The passages of this kind, with which the  Koran abounds, result from Muhammad's general acquaintance with Scriptural  phraseology, partly through the popular legends, partly from personal  intercourse with Jews and Christians. And we may be quite certain that  whatever materials Muhammad may have derived from our Scriptures, directly or  indirectly, were carefully recast. He did not even use its words without due  consideration. For instance, except in the phrase \"the Lord of the worlds,\"  he seems carefully to have avoided the expression the Lord, probably because  it was applied by the Christians to Christ, or to God the Father.    It should also be borne in mind that we have no traces of the existence of  Arabic versions of the Old or New Testament previous to the time of Muhammad.  The passage of St. Jerome\"Hæc autem translatio nullum de veteribus sequitur  interpretem; sed ex ipso Hebraico, Arabicoque sermone, et interdum Syro, nunc  verba, nunc sensum, nunc simul utrumque resonabit,\" (Prol. Gal.) obviously  does not refer to versions, but to idiom. The earliest Ar. version of the Old  Testament, of which we have any knowledge, is that of R. Saadias Gaon, A.D.  900; and the oldest Ar. version of the New Testament, is that published by  Erpenius in 1616, and transcribed in the Thebais, in the year 1171, by a  Coptic Bishop, from a copy made by a person whose name is known, but whose  date is uncertain. Michaelis thinks that the Arabic versions of the New  Testament were made between the Saracen conquests in the seventh century, and  the Crusades in the eleventh centuryan opinion in which he follows, or  coincides with, Walton (Prol. in Polygl. § xiv.) who remarks\"Plane constat  versionem Arabicam apud eas (ecclesias orientales) factam esse postquam  lingua Arabica per victorias et religionem Muhammedanicam per Orientem  propagata fuerat, et in multis locis facta esset vernacula.\" If, indeed, in  these comparatively late versions, the general phraseology, especially in the  histories common to the Scriptures and to the Koran, bore any similarity to  each other, and if the orthography of the proper names had been the same in  each, it might have been fair to suppose that such versions had been made,  more or less, upon the basis of others, which, though now lost, existed in  the ages prior to Muhammad, and influenced, if they did not directly form,  his sources of information. But5 this does not appear to be the case. The  phraseology of our existing versions is not that of the Koranand these  versions appear to have been made from the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Syriac,  Coptic, and Greek; the four Gospels, says Tischendorf6 originem mixtam habere  videntur.    From the Arab Jews, Muhammad would be enabled to derive an abundant, though  most distorted, knowledge of the Scripture histories. The secrecy in which he  received his instructions from them, and from his Christian informants,  enabled him boldly to declare to the ignorant pagan Meccans that God had  revealed those Biblical histories to him. But there can be no doubt, from the  constant identity between the Talmudic perversions of Scripture histories and  Rabbinic moral precepts, that the Rabbins of the Hejaz communicated their  legends to Muhammad. And it should be remembered that the Talmud was  completed a century previous to the era of Muhammad,7 and cannot fail to have  extensively influenced the religious creed of all the Jews of the Arabian  peninsula. In one passage,8 Muhammad speaks of an individual Jewperhaps some  one of note among his professed followers, as a witness to his mission; and  there can be no doubt that his relations with the Jews were, at one time,  those of friendship and intimacy, when we find him speak of their recognising  him as they do their own children, and hear him blaming their most colloquial  expressions.9 It is impossible, however, for us at this distance of time to  penetrate the mystery in which this subject is involved. Yet certain it is,  that, although their testimony against Muhammad was speedily silenced, the  Koreisch knew enough of his private history to disbelieve and to disprove his  pretensions of being the recipient of a divine revelation, and that they  accused him of writing from the dictation of teachers morning and evening.10  And it is equally certain, that all the information received by Muhammad was  embellished and recast in his own mind and with his own words. There is a  unity of thought, a directness and simplicity of purpose, a peculiar and  laboured style, a uniformity of diction, coupled with a certain deficiency of  imaginative power, which proves the ayats (signs or verses) of the Koran at  least to be the product of a single pen. The longer narratives were,  probably, elaborated in his leisure hours, while the shorter verses, each  claiming to be a sign or miracle, were promulgated as occasion required them.  And, whatever Muhammad may himself profess in the Koran11 as to his  ignorance, even of reading and writing, and however strongly modern  Muhammadans may insist upon the same point an assertion by the way  contradicted by many good authors12there can be no doubt that to assimilate  and work up his materials, to fashion them into elaborate Suras, to fit them  for public recital, must have been a work requiring much time, study, and  meditation, and presumes a far greater degree of general culture than any  orthodox Muslim will be disposed to admit.    In close connection with the above remarks, stands the question of Muhammad's  sincerity and honesty of purpose in coming forward as a messenger from God.  For if he was indeed the illiterate person the Muslims represent him to have  been, then it will be hard to escape their inference that the Koran is, as  they assert it to be, a standing miracle. But if, on the other hand, it was a  Book carefully concocted from various sources, and with much extraneous aid,  and published as a divine oracle, then it would seem that the author is at  once open to the charge of the grossest imposture, and even of impious  blasphemy. The evidence rather shews, that in all he did and wrote, Muhammad  was actuated by a sincere desire to deliver his countrymen from the grossness  of its debasing idolatriesthat he was urged on by an intense desire to  proclaim that great truth of the Unity of the Godhead which had taken full  possession of his own soulthat the end to be attained justified to his mind  the means he adopted in the production of his Surasthat he worked himself up  into a belief that he had received a divine calland that he was carried on  by the force of circumstances, and by gradually increasing successes, to  believe himself the accredited messenger of Heaven. The earnestness of those  convictions which at Mecca sustained him under persecution, and which perhaps  led him, at any price as it were, and by any means, not even excluding deceit  and falsehood, to endeavour to rescue his countrymen from idolatry,naturally  stiffened at Medina into tyranny and unscrupulous violence. At the same time,  he was probably, more or less, throughout his whole career, the victim of a  certain amount of self-deception. A cataleptic13 subject from his early  youth, bornaccording to the traditionsof a highly nervous and excitable  mother, he would be peculiarly liable to morbid and fantastic hallucinations,  and alternations of excitement and depression, which would win for him, in  the eyes of his ignorant countrymen, the credit of being inspired. It would  be easy for him to persuade himself that he was \"the seal of the Prophets,\"  the proclaimer of a doctrine of the Divine Unity, held and taught by the  Patriarchs, especially by Abrahama doctrine that should present to mankind  Judaism divested of its Mosaic ceremonial, and Christianity divested of the  Atonement and the Trinity14doctrine, as he might have believed, fitted and  destined to absorb Judaism, Christianity, and Idolatry; and this persuasion,  once admitted into his mind as a conviction, retained possession of it, and  carried him on, though often in the use of means, towards the end of his  career, far different from those with which he commenced it, to a victorious  consummation.

Of young trees there were most on the bluestem prairie area, less on  the former pastures and least on the fallow fields. In both the  pasture areas and the fallow fields, the bottomlands had fewer trees  than the hilltops--60 per cent and 94.3 per cent, respectively. In  every instance the abundance of young trees seemed to be inversely  proportional to the amount of competing herbaceous vegetation. The  bottomland fallow fields, which had the fewest tree seedlings, were  dominated by a rank growth of giant ragweed and sunflower, often as  much as ten feet tall, effectively shutting most of the light from the  tree seedlings. By 1954, however, the sunflower was nearly eliminated,  and the giant ragweed, though still abundant, was much stunted.    The bluestem prairie on an area of hilltop and upper slope had not  been burned over or otherwise disturbed for some years prior to 1948,  and probably trees began to invade this area years before they invaded  the fallow fields and pastures accounting, in part, for their greater  abundance in 1952. Approximately half of the young trees on this  prairie area were boxelders, which were relatively scarce on the other  four areas. Elm was either first or second in abundance on each area.  On both types of pasture areas honey locusts were appearing in  abundance and osage orange seedlings were present in somewhat smaller  numbers. However, these two kinds of trees were almost entirely absent  from the other areas sampled, except that a few locusts were recorded  on a hilltop fallow field. In 1948 honey locust seeds were noticed in  great abundance in the droppings of cattle; their dispersal in this  manner probably is in large part responsible for the abundance of  young honey locusts throughout the former pastures. Osage orange may  have been distributed in the same manner. Seedlings of dogwood were  moderately numerous on each one of the areas sampled, and those of red  haw were somewhat less abundant on each area. Crab-apple was the most  abundant species invading the hilltop pastures but was scarce or  absent in the other situations. The remaining species of trees,  including coffee-tree, hackberry, cottonwood, ash, plum, peach,  cherry, cockspur thorn, sycamore, and redbud, each made up only a  small percentage of the tree crop in the situations where they  occurred.    In late July and early August, 1954, counts of young trees were made  again on the upland pasture area, with a total of 200 1/100-acre plot  samples. This sample was taken at the end of one of the longest and  most severe droughts in the history of the area. Both 1952 and 1953  had drought summers, and up to the end of July the summer of 1954 was  exceptionally dry also. The conditions of the young trees at this  time, in the relatively dry and shallow hilltop soil, was especially  significant. As might have been anticipated, in this 1954 count, young  trees were more numerous than they had been on any of the areas  sampled in 1952. However, the data for 1952 and 1954 are not entirely  comparable, because in 1952 none of the plots sampled was nearer than  50 feet to the edge of the woods, whereas in 1954, the sample was  arranged to be representative of the entire field, including the parts  adjacent to the woods. The numbers per acre of each kind of tree, and  the percentages that were dead or dying, were as follows: crab-apple  167 (33.5 per cent dead); locust 98 (3 per cent dead); elm 69.5 (2.9  per cent dead); osage orange 63.5 (none dead); walnut 36.5 (4.1 per  cent dead); red haw 25.5 (none dead); ash 19.5 (none dead); cockspur  thorn 17 (17.6 per cent dead); wild plum 14 (3.6 per cent dead);  dogwood 9.5 (none dead); prickly ash 2 (25 per cent dead); black oak  1.5 (none dead); boxelder .5 (none dead). Thus, of the species that  were prominent invaders of the field, only crab-apple showed heavy  mortality. In many instances the mortality in crab-apple was due  wholly or in part to attack by cottontails (_Sylvilagus floridanus_),  which had completely girdled many of the stems. In general, mortality  in the young trees was light in this grassland area compared with the  mortality in any part of the woodland.          Competition and Mortality      The ratios of trees of different species and different size groups  reflect, to some extent, the changes to which the area has been  subjected. Under original conditions mature trees of oak and hickory  dominated the forest. With the opening up of the forest that resulted  from cutting most of these mature trees, other kinds of trees  increased and spread. Species relatively intolerant of shading became  established. Chinquapin oak, honey locust, osage orange, cherry,  dogwood, red haw, and crab-apple, being especially intolerant of  shading, cannot grow in close competition with climax species, and  they become established only in fairly open situations. Their presence  in thick woodland, along with climax competitors, usually is an  indication that the woodland is either of recent origin or has been  much disturbed in the past, permitting invasion by them.    About 1934 when approximately half of the Reservation, including  nearly all the woodland areas, was fenced against livestock, shrubs  and young trees sprang up in great abundance, especially in more open  woodland situations, and at the edge of the forest. Sumac (_Rhus  glabra_) often dominated at first in such situations. Crab-apple, wild  plum, red haw, chinquapin oak, prickly ash, dogwood, honey locust, and  redbud also soon came into prominence. By 1954 thickets had grown up  and the intense competition had killed much of the woody vegetation.  Sumac, especially, had been almost entirely killed out by the shading.  By then, however, the adjacent fields had been protected for eight  years from grazing, and sparse sumac thickets were present on the  field sides of the fences, the average sizes of the plants  progressively declining farther from the edge of the woods. Much  mortality had occurred also in all the other species mentioned, with  only a few of the larger surviving in competition with elm, hackberry,  ash and osage orange, and with reproduction practically stopped except  near the edges of the thickets.    In 1954, after approximately 20 years of protection from livestock,  the woodland had become much denser, with a thick understory of  saplings and tall shrubs in most places. From a time soon after  protection was initiated, there was little or no reproduction (except  where the woodland originally was open) in blackjack oak, dwarf or  chinquapin oak, red haw, honey locust, and osage orange. On one south  slope, an open woods with well scattered trees of black oak, American  elm, hackberry, honey locust and osage orange, had by 1954 become so  dense that it was almost impassable except with the aid of a brush  knife to cut or break through the thickets. Saplings of honey locust  made up an important part of the understory vegetation on this slope.  Those of the smallest size group, up to 1-1/2 inches stem diameter,  were mostly dead; in a strip 900 feet long and 50 feet wide there were  29 dead saplings and ten live ones of this size group. In the next  largest size group, up to 2-1/2 inches in stem diameter, there were 17  dead and 53 live saplings, while in the size group 2-1/2 to 3-1/2  inches stem diameter, there was one dead sapling and 51 were alive.    On another south slope, which had more large and medium-sized trees  and less dense underbrush, 233 saplings six inches or less in stem  diameter, counted on a sample strip 530 feet long and 40 feet wide,  included elm 37.3%, dogwood 19.7%, hackberry 16.4%, coffee-tree 15.6%,  honey locust 11.0%, plum 10.3%, chestnut oak 5.5%, crab-apple 3.4%,  osage orange 2.1%, red haw 1.4%, hickory, redbud, mulberry and  cockspur thorn each .7%. There was substantial mortality in the  saplings of several of these species; plum 86.5%, dogwood 69.5%, elm  49.5%, locust 31.2%, chestnut oak 25.0%, coffee-tree 4.4%.    By 1954 several areas of hilltop-edge and north slope, which  presumably had been wooded originally, but which had been subjected to  heavy cutting, supported thriving stands of young hickories mostly two  to six inches in trunk diameter. Most of these saplings seemed to have  originated as stump-or root-sprouts. These numerous and closely spaced  saplings produced a dense and almost continuous leaf canopy, shading  and killing out many of the smaller trees of their own species as well  as competing elms, redbuds, dogwoods, hackberries and others.    On a north slope in the southeastern part of the Reservation, many  large stumps were found in late stages of decay, cut from 20 to 30 or  more years before. Insofar as could be determined, these old stumps  were mostly of oaks, but in 1954 the trees growing on this slope were  chiefly elms and coffee-trees less than one foot in diameter.          Effects of Livestock      Livestock importantly affected the trend of succession. The tendency  of grazing animals to hold back the forest by stripping the foliage  from young trees and killing them is selective, however; the several  kinds of trees differ in their tolerance to browsing and in their  palatability to animals. The kind of animal and the season and  intensity of use also have important bearing on the ultimate effect.  Several kinds of shrubs and small trees seem to be especially  susceptible to damage by browsing; chinquapin oak, crab-apple, plum,  hazel, dogwood, prickly ash, and paw paw were found to be either  absent entirely from the parts of the woodland that were heavily used  by stock, or much scarcer than they were on adjacent unbrowsed areas.  Some woody plants that are even more susceptible may have been  completely eliminated by browsing.    In the thirties when most of the woodland area was fenced off and"]]]
