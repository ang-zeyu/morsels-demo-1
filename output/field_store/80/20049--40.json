It is  highly natural to suppose that the \"Rai,\" when attacked by the Sultan,  would have quitted Kampli and taken refuge in the fortified heights  of Anegundi, where he could defend himself with far greater chance  of success than at the former place; and this would account for the  difference in the names given by the two chroniclers. Ibn Batuta goes  on to say that the Raya sent his guest safely away to a neighbouring  chief, probably the Hoysala Ballala, king of Dvarasamudra in Maisur,  then residing at Tanur. He caused a huge fire to be lit on which  his wives and the wives of his nobles, ministers, and principal  men immolated themselves, and this done he sallied forth with his  followers to meet the invaders, and was slain. The town was taken,  \"and eleven sons of the Rai were made prisoners and carried to the  Sultan, who made them all Mussalmans.\" After the fall of the place  the Sultan \"treated the king's sons with great honour, as much for  their illustrious birth as for his admiration of the conduct of their  father;\" and Batuta adds that he himself became intimately acquainted  with one of these -- \"we were companions and friends.\"    There are only two substantial points of difference between this  story and the traditional Hindu account given by Nuniz. One of these  concerns the reason for the Sultan's attack. According to the Hindus  it was a war undertaken from pure greed of conquest; according to  Muhammadan story it was a campaign against a rebel. The second is  that while the Hindus declare that none of the blood royal escaped,  Batuta distinctly mentions the survival of eleven sons, and proves his  point incontestably. But this does not vitiate the general resemblance  of the two accounts, while the synchronism of the dates renders it  impossible to believe that they can refer to two separate events. We  may suppose that since the eleven sons became followers of Islam they  were for ever blotted out of account to the orthodox Hindu.    After the capture of the fortress the Sultan, according to Ibn Batuta,  pursued Baha-ud-din southwards and arrived near the city of the prince  with whom he had taken refuge. The chief abandoned his guest to the  tender mercies of the tyrant, by whom he was condemned to a death of  fiendish barbarity.    \"The Sultan ordered the prisoner to be taken to the women his  relations, and these insulted him and spat upon him. Then he ordered  him to be skinned alive, and as his skin was torn off his flesh was  cooked with rice. Some was sent to his children and his wife, and the  remainder was put into a great dish and given to the elephants to eat,  but they would not touch it. The Sultan ordered his skin to be stuffed  with straw, to be placed along with the remains of Bahadur Bura,[26]  and to be exhibited through the country.\"    To continue briefly the story given by Nuniz. After the capture  of Anegundi in 1334 the Sultan left Malik Naib (whom Nuniz calls  \"Enybiquymelly\" in his second chapter, and \"Mileque neby,\" \"Meliquy  niby,\" and \"Melinebiquy\" in the third) as his local governor, and  retired northwards. The country rose against the usurpers, and after a  time the Sultan restored the principality to the Hindus, but made a new  departure by raising to be Raya the former chief minister Deva Raya,  called \"Deorao\" or \"Dehorao\" by Nuniz. He reigned seven years. During  his reign this chief was one day hunting amongst the mountains south of  the river when a hare, instead of fleeing from his dogs, flew at them  and bit them.[27] The king, astonished at this marvel, was returning  homewards lost in meditation, when he met on the river-bank the sage  Madhavacharya, surnamed VIDYARANYA or \"Forest of Learning,\" -- for so  we learn from other sources to name the anchorite alluded to -- who  advised the chief to found a city on the spot. \"And so the king did,  and on that very day began work on his houses, and he enclosed the  city round about; and that done, he left Nagumdym, and soon filled  the new city with people. And he gave it the name VYDIAJUNA, for so  the hermit called himself who had bidden him construct it.\"[28]    Thus, in or about the year A.D. 1336, sprung into existence the great  city which afterwards became so magnificent and of such wide-spread  fame.    The chronicle continues by saying that the king constructed in the  city of Vijayanagar a magnificent temple in honour of the sage. This  temple I take to be the great temple near the river, still in use  and known as the temple of Hampi or Hampe, having a small village  clustering about it. On the rocks above it, close to a group of more  modern Jain temples, is to be seen a small shrine built entirely,  roof as well as walls, of stone. Everything about this little relic  proves it to be of greater antiquity than any other structure in the  whole circuit of the hills, but its exact age is doubtful. It looks  like a building of the seventh century A.D. Mr. Rea, superintendent  of the Madras Archaeological Survey, in an article published in the  MADRAS CHRISTIAN COLLEGE MAGAZINE for December 1886, points out that  the fact of mortar having been used in its construction throws a doubt  upon its being as old as its type of architecture would otherwise  make it appear. It is quite possible, however, that the shrine may  have been used by a succession of recluses, the last of whom was the  great teacher Madhava. If we stand on that rock and imagine all the  great ruins of the city visible from thence, the palaces and temples,  the statues and towers and walls, to be swept out of existence, we  have around us nothing but Nature in one of her wildest moods -- lofty  hills near and far, formed almost entirely of huge tumbled boulders  of granite, but with trees and grass on all the low ground. It was a  lonely spot, separated by the river from the mere inhabited country  on the farther side, where dwelt the chiefs of Anegundi, and was  just such as would have been chosen for their abode by the ascetics  of former days, who loved to dwell in solitude and isolation amid  scenes of grandeur and beauty.    We shall, however, in all probability never know whether this hermit,  whose actual existence at the time is attested by every tradition  regarding the origin of Vijayanagar, was really the great Madhava or  another less celebrated sage, on whom by a confusion of ideas his  name has been foisted. Some say that Madhavacharya lived entirely  at Sringeri.    There are a number of other traditions relating to the birth of the  city and empire of Vijayanagar.    One has it that two brothers named Bukka and Harihara, who had been  in the service of the king of Warangal at the time of the destruction  of that kingdom by the Muhammadans in 1323, escaped with a small  body of horse to the hill country about Anegundi, being accompanied  in their flight by the Brahman Madhava or Madhavacharya Vidyaranya,  and by some means not stated became lords of that tract, afterwards  founding the city of Vijayanagar.[29]    Another states that the two brothers were officers in the service of  the Muhammadan governor of Warangal subsequent to its first capture  in 1309. They were despatched against the Hoysala Ballala sovereign  in the expedition under the command of Malik Kafur in 1310, which  resulted in the capture of the Hindu capital, Dvarasamudra; but the  portion of the force to which the brothers belonged suffered a defeat,  and they fled to the mountainous tract near Anegundi. Here they met  the holy Madhava, who was living the life of a recluse, and by his  aid they established the kingdom and capital city.    A variant of this relates that the two brothers for some reason  fled direct from Warangal to Anegundi. This account redounds more  to their honour as Hindus. Though compelled first to accept service  under their conquerors, their patriotism triumphed in the end, and  they abandoned the flesh pots of Egypt to throw in their luck with  their co-religionists.    A fourth story avers that the hermit Madhava himself founded the city  after the discovery of a hidden treasure, ruled over it himself,  and left it after his death to a Kuruba family who established the  first regular dynasty.    A fifth, mentioned by Couto,[30] who fixes the date as 1220, states  that while Madhava was living his ascetic life amongst the mountains  he was supported by meals brought to him by a poor shepherd called  Bukka, \"and one day the Brahman said to him, 'Thou shalt be king and  emperor of all Industan.' The other shepherds learned this, and began  to treat this shepherd with veneration and made him their head; and  he acquired the name of 'king,' and began to conquer his neighbours,  who were five in number, viz., Canara, Taligas, Canguivarao, Negapatao,  and he of the Badagas, and he at last became lord of all and called  himself Boca Rao.\" He was attacked by the king of Delhi, but the  latter was defeated and retired, whereupon Bukka established a city  \"and called it Visaja Nagar, which we corruptly call Bisnaga; and we  call all the kingdom by that name, but the natives amongst themselves  always call it the 'kingdom of Canara.' \" Couto's narrative seems to  be a mixture of several stories. His wrong date points to his having  partly depended upon the original chronicle of Nuniz, or the summary  of it published by Barros; while the rest of the tale savours more  of Hindu romance than of historical accuracy. He retains, however,  the tradition of an attack by the king of Delhi and the latter's  subsequent retirement.    Another authority suggests that Bukka and Harihara may have been  feudatories of the Hoysala Ballalas.    Nikitin, the Russian traveller, who was in India in 1474, seems to  favour the view that they belonged to the old royal house of the  Kadambas of Banavasi, since he speaks of \"the Hindoo Sultan Kadam,\"  who resided at \"Bichenegher.\"[31]    Here we have a whole bundle of tales and traditions to account"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#5)"],[1,"nearly the whole of the square, a strange and very original  structure, which in its principles would astonish a European architect.  It was a gigantic circular scaffold, perhaps fifteen hundred feet in  circumference, capable of containing four or five thousand persons,  erected and held together without the use of a single nail, being made  of rude poles, just as they were cut in the woods, and tied together  with withes. The interior was enclosed by long poles, crossing and  interlacing each other, leaving only an opening for the door, and was  divided in like manner by poles into boxes. The whole formed a gigantic  frame of rustic lattice-work, admirably adapted for that hot climate,  as it admitted a free circulation of air. The top was covered with an  arbour made of the leaves of the American palm. The whole structure was  simple and curious. Every Indian could assist in building it, and when  the fiesta was over it could be torn down, and the materials used for  firewood.    The corrida had begun when we arrived on the ground, and the place was  already thronged. There was a great choice of seats, as one side was  exposed to the full blaze of the sun. Over the doors were written Palco  No. 1, Palco No. 2, &c., and each box had a separate proprietor, who  stood in the doorway, with a little rickety step-ladder of three or  four steps, inviting customers. One of them undertook to provide for  us, and for two reals apiece we were conducted to front seats. It was,  if possible, hotter than at the loteria, and in the movement and  confusion of passing us to our seats, the great scaffold trembled, and  seemed actually swaying to and fro under its living load.    The spectators were of all classes, colours, and ages, from gray heads  to children asleep in their mother's arms; and next to me was a  half-blooded maternal head of a family, with the key of her house in  her hand, her children tacked in between the legs of her neighbours, or  under their chairs. At the feet of those sitting on the front seats was  a row of boys and girls, with their little heads poked through the  railing; and all around hung down a variegated fringe-work of black and  white legs. Opposite, and on the top of the scaffold, was a band of  music, the leader of which wore a shining black mask, caricaturing a  negro.    A bull was in the ring, two barbed darts trimmed with blue and yellow  paper were hanging from his flanks, and his neck was pierced with  wounds, from which ran down streams of blood. The picadores stood aloof  with bloody spears in their hands; a mounted dragoon was master of  ceremonies, and there were, besides, eight or ten vaqueros, or  cattle-tenders, from the neighbouring haciendas, hard riders, and  brought up to deal with cattle that run wild in the woods. These were  dressed in pink-coloured shirt and trousers, and wore small hats of  straw platted thick, with low round crowns, and narrow brims turned up  at the side. Their saddles had large leathern flaps, covering half the  body of the horse, and each had a lazo, or coil of rope, in his hand,  and a pair of enormous iron spurs, perhaps six inches long, and  weighing two or three pounds, which, contrasted with their small  horses, gave a sort of Bombastes Furioso character to their appearance.  By the order of the dragoon, these vaqueros, striking their coils of  rope against the large flaps of their saddles, started the bull, and,  chasing him round the ring, with a few throws of the lazo caught him by  the horns and dragged him to a post at one side of the ring, where,  riding off with the rope, they hauled his head down to the ground close  against the post. Keeping it down in that position, some of the others  passed a rope twice round his body just behind the fore legs, and,  securing it on the back, passed it under his tail, and returning it,  crossed it with the coils around his body. Two or three men on each  side then hauled upon the rope, which cut into and compressed the  bull's chest, and by its tightness under the tail almost lifted his  hind legs from off the ground. This was to excite and madden him. The  poor animal bellowed, threw himself on the ground, and kicked and  struggled to get rid of the brutal tie. From the place where we sat we  had in full view the front of the church of San Cristoval, and over the  door we read in large characters, \"_Hic est domus Dei, hic est porta  c[oe]li_\" \"Here is the house of God, here is the gate of heaven.\"    But they had yet another goad for the bull. Watching narrowly that the  ropes around his horns did not get loose, they fixed upon his back the  figure of a soldier in a cocked hat, seated in a saddle. This excited a  great laugh among the spectators. We learned that both the saddle and  the figure of the soldier were made of wood, paper, and gunpowder,  composing a formidable piece of fireworks. When this was fairly  secured, all fell back, and the picadores, mounted, and with their  spears poised, took their places in the ring. The band, perhaps in  compliment to us, and to remind us of home, struck up the beautiful  _national_ melody of \"Jim Crow.\" A villanous-looking fellow set off  large and furiously-whizzing rockets within a few feet of the bull;  another fired in the heel the figure of the soldier on his back; the  spectators shouted, the rope was slipped, and the bull let loose.    His first dash was perfectly furious. Bounding forward and throwing up  his hind legs, maddened by the shouts of the crowd, and the whizzing  and explosion, fire and smoke of the engine of torture on his back, he  dashed blindly at every picador, receiving thrust after thrust with the  spear, until, amid the loud laughter and shouts of the spectators, the  powder burned out, and the poor beast, with gaping wounds, and blood  streaming from them, turned and ran, bellowed for escape at the gate of  entrance, and then crawled around the wall of the ring, looking up to  the spectators, and with imploring eyes seemed pleading to the mild  faces of the women for mercy.    In a few minutes he was lazoed and dragged off, and he had hardly  disappeared when another was led in, the manner of whose introduction  seemed more barbarous and brutal than any of the torments inflicted on  the former. It was by a rope two or three hundred feet long, passed  through the fleshy part of the bull's nose, and secured at both ends to  the vaquero's saddle. In this way he was hauled through the streets and  into the ring. Another vaquero followed, with a lazo over the horns, to  hold the bull back, and keep him from rushing upon his leader. In the  centre of the ring the leader loosed one end of the rope, and, riding  on, dragged it trailing on the ground its whole length, perhaps a  hundred yards, through the bull's nose, leaving a crust of dirt on one  side as it came out bloody on the other. The bull, held back by the  rope over his horns, stood with his neck outstretched; and when the end  of the rope passed through, he licked his gory nose, pawed the ground,  and bellowed.    He was then lazoed, dragged up to the post, girt with the rope around  his body like the other, and then, amid bursts of music, rockets, and  shouts, again let loose. The chulos went at him, flaring before him  with the left hand red and yellow ponchas, and holding in the right  darts containing fireworks, and ornamented with yellow paper cut into  slips. These they thrust into his neck and flanks. The current of air  accelerated the ignition of the fire; and when the fireworks exploded,  the paper still rattled about his ears. The picadores then mounted  their horses; but, after a few thrusts of the spear, the bull flinched,  and the spectators, indignant that he did not show more fight, cried  out, \"_Saca esa vaca!_\" \"Take out that _cow_!\"    The next was hauled on in the same way by a rope through his nose. He  was girt with the rope, tortured with darts, speared by the picadores  on horseback, and, as he did not show good fight, they dismounted and  attacked him on foot. This is considered the most dangerous contest  both for man and beast. The picadores formed in front of him, each with  a black or yellow poncha in his left hand, and poising his spear with  the right. They stood with their legs extended and knees bent, so as to  keep a firm foothold, changing position by a spring forward or  backward, on one side or the other, to meet the movement of the bull's  head. The object was to strike between the horns into the back of the  neck. Two or three struck him fairly with a cutting, heavy sound, and  drew out their spears reeking with blood. One man misdirected his blow;  the bull threw up his neck with the long handle of the spear standing  upright in it, and rushing upon the picador, hurled him to the ground,  and passed over his body, seeming to strike him with all four of his  hoofs. The man never moved, but lay on his back, with his arms  outstretched, apparently dead. The bull moved on with the handle of the  spear still standing up in his neck, a terror to all in the ring. The  vaqueros went in pursuit of him with the lazos, and, chasing him round,  the spear fell out, and they caught him. In the mean time, the fallen  man was picked up by some of his companions, and carried off, doubled  up, and apparently cured forever of bull-fighting. We heard afterward  that he only had some of his ribs broken.    He was hardly out of sight when the accident was forgotten; the bull  was again assaulted, worried out, and dragged off. Others followed,  making eight in all. At twelve o'clock the church bells rang and the  fight ended, but, as we were dispersing, we were reminded that another  would begin at four o'clock in the afternoon.    At four we were again in our places. Our special reason for following  up this sport so closely was because we were advised that in the  morning common people only attended, but that in the afternoon all the  _gente"]]]
