In  some ways, perhaps, these malleable types of women, \"soft paste\" as one  authority has described them, \"effacees\" in the words of another, are  the most dangerous material of all for the commission of crime, their  obedience is so complete, so cold and relentless.    There are cases into which no element of passion enters, in which one  will stronger than the other can so influence, so dominate the weaker as  to persuade the individual against his or her better inclination to an  act of crime, just as in the relations of ordinary life we see a man  or woman led and controlled for good or ill by one stronger than  themselves. There is no more extraordinary instance of this than the  case of Catherine Hayes, immortalised by Thackeray, which occurred  as long ago as the year 1726. This singular woman by her artful  insinuations, by representing her husband as an atheist and a murderer,  persuaded a young man of the name of Wood, of hitherto exemplary  character, to assist her in murdering him. It was unquestionably the  sinister influence of Captain Cranstoun that later in the same century  persuaded the respectable Miss Mary Blandy to the murder of her father.  The assassin of an old woman in Paris recounts thus the arguments used  by his mistress to induce him to commit the crime: \"She began by telling  me about the money and jewellery in the old woman's possession which  could no longer be of any use to her\"--the argument of Raskolnikoff--\"I  resisted, but next day she began again, pointing out that one killed  people in war, which was not considered a crime, and therefore one  should not be afraid to kill a miserable old woman. I urged that the old  woman had done us no harm, and that I did not see why one should kill  her; she reproached me for my weakness and said that, had she been  strong enough, she would soon have done this abominable deed herself.  'God,' she added, 'will forgive us because He knows how poor we are.'\"  When he came to do the murder, this determined woman plied her lover  with brandy and put rouge on his cheeks lest his pallor should betray  him.(7)           (7) Case of Albert and the woman Lavoitte, Paris, 1877.      There are occasions when those feelings of compunction which troubled  Macbeth and his wife are wellnigh proof against the utmost powers of  suggestion, or, as in the case of Hubert and Prince Arthur, compel the  criminal to desist from his enterprise.    A man desires to get rid of his father and mother-in-law. By means of  threats, reproaches and inducements he persuades another man to commit  the crime. Taking a gun, the latter sets out to do the deed; but he  realises the heinousness of it and turns back. \"The next day,\" he says,  \"at four o'clock in the morning I started again. I passed the village  church. At the sight of the place where I had celebrated my first  communion I was filled with remorse. I knelt down and prayed to God to  make me good. But some unknown force urged me to the crime. I started  again--ten times I turned back, but the more I hesitated the stronger  was the desire to go on.\" At length the faltering assassin arrived at  the house, and in his painful anxiety of mind shot a servant instead of  the intended victims.(8)           (8) Case of Porcher and Hardouin cited in Despine. \"Psychologie  Naturelle.\"      In a town in Austria there dwelt a happy and contented married couple,  poor and hard-working. A charming young lady, a rich relation and an  orphan, comes to live with them. She brings to their modest home wealth  and comfort. But as time goes on, it is likely that the young lady will  fall in love and marry. What then? Her hosts will have to return  to their original poverty. The idea of how to secure to himself the  advantages of his young kinswoman's fortune takes possession of the  husband's mind. He revolves all manner of means, and gradually murder  presents itself as the only way. The horrid suggestion fixes itself  in his mind, and at last he communicates it to his wife. At first she  resists, then yields to the temptation. The plan is ingenious. The wife  is to disappear to America and be given out as dead. The husband will  then marry his attractive kinswoman, persuade her to make a will in his  favour, poison her and, the fortune secured, rejoin his wife. As if  to help this cruel plan, the young lady has developed a sentimental  affection for her relative. The wife goes to America, the husband  marries the young lady. He commences to poison her, but, in the presence  of her youth, beauty and affection for him, relents, hesitates to commit  a possibly unnecessary crime. He decides to forget and ignore utterly  his wife who is waiting patiently in America. A year passes. The  expectant wife gets no sign of her husband's existence. She comes back  to Europe, visits under a false name the town in which her faithless  husband and his bride are living, discovers the truth and divulges the  intended crime to the authorities. A sentence of penal servitude for  life rewards this perfidious criminal.(9)           (9) Case of the Scheffer couple at Linz, cited by Sighele.      Derues said to a man who was looking at a picture in the Palais de  Justice: \"Why study copies of Nature when you can look at such a  remarkable original as I?\" A judge once told the present writer that he  did not go often to the theatre because none of the dramas which he saw  on the stage, seemed to him equal in intensity to those of real life  which came before him in the course of his duties. The saying that truth  is stranger than fiction applies more forcibly to crime than to  anything else. But the ordinary man and woman prefer to take their crime  romanticised, as it is administered to them in novel or play. The true  stories told in this book represent the raw material from which works  of art have been and may be yet created. The murder of Mr. Arden of  Faversham inspired an Elizabethan tragedy attributed by some critics  to Shakespeare. The Peltzer trial helped to inspire Paul Bourget's  remarkable novel, \"Andre Cornelis.\" To Italian crime we owe Shelley's  \"Cenci\" and Browning's \"The Ring and the Book.\" Mrs. Manning was the  original of the maid Hortense in \"Bleak House.\" Jonathan Wild, Eugene  Aram, Deacon Brodie, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright have all been made  the heroes of books or plays of varying merit. But it is not only in its  stories that crime has served to inspire romance. In the investigation  of crime, especially on the broader lines of Continental procedure, we  can track to the source the springs of conduct and character, and come  near to solving as far as is humanly possible the mystery of human  motive. There is always and must be in every crime a terra incognita  which, unless we could enter into the very soul of a man, we cannot hope  to reach. Thus far may we go, no farther. It is rarely indeed that a man  lays bare his whole soul, and even when he does we can never be quite  sure that he is telling us all the truth, that he is not keeping back  some vital secret. It is no doubt better so, and that it should be left  to the writer of imagination to picture for us a man's inmost soul. The  study of crime will help him to that end. It will help us also in the  ethical appreciation of good and evil in individual conduct, about which  our notions have been somewhat obscured by too narrow a definition  of what constitutes crime. These themes, touched on but lightly and  imperfectly in these pages, are rich in human interest.    And so it is hardly a matter for surprise that the poet and the  philosopher sat up late one night talking about murders.          The Life of Charles Peace      \"Charles Peace, or the Adventures of a Notorious Burglar,\" a large  volume published at the time of his death, gives a full and accurate  account of the career of Peace side by side with a story of the Family  Herald type, of which he is made the hero. \"The Life and Trial of  Charles Peace\" (Sheffield, 1879), \"The Romantic Career of a Great  Criminal\" (by N. Kynaston Gaskell, London 1906), and \"The Master  Criminal,\" published recently in London give useful information. I have  also consulted some of the newspapers of the time. There is a delightful  sketch of Peace in Mr. Charles Whibley's \"Book of Scoundrels.\"    I    HIS EARLY YEARS    Charles Peace told a clergyman who had an interview with him in prison  shortly before his execution that he hoped that, after he was gone, he  would be entirely forgotten by everybody and his name never mentioned  again.    Posterity, in calling over its muster-roll of famous men, has refused  to fulfil this pious hope, and Charley Peace stands out as the one  great personality among English criminals of the nineteenth century. In  Charley Peace alone is revived that good-humoured popularity which  in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fell to the lot of Claude  Duval, Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard. But Peace has one grievance  against posterity; he has endured one humiliation which these heroes  have been spared. His name has been omitted from the pages of the  \"Dictionary of National Biography.\" From Duval, in the seventeenth,  down to the Mannings, Palmer, Arthur Orton, Morgan and Kelly, the  bushrangers, in the nineteenth century, many a criminal, far less  notable or individual than Charley Peace, finds his or her place in that  great record of the past achievements of our countrymen. Room has  been denied to perhaps the greatest and most naturally gifted criminal  England has produced, one whose character is all the more remarkable for  its modesty, its entire freedom from that vanity and vaingloriousness  so common among his class.    The only possible reason that can be suggested for so singular an  omission is the fact that in the strict order of alphabetical succession  the biography of Charles Peace would have followed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#5)"],[1,"quite independent  of that belief.  Finally we see that it is impossible to modify  the convictions of men without also modifying their existence.    These phenomena verified, we shall see plainly why the gospel of  the Revolution was propagated by the same methods as all the  religious gospels, notably that of Calvin.  It could not have  been propagated otherwise.    But although there are close analogies between the genesis of a  religious revolution, such as the Reformation, and that of a  great political revolution like our own, their remote  consequences are very different, which explains the difference of  duration which they display.  In religious revolutions no  experience can reveal to the faithful that they are deceived,  since they would have to go to heaven to make the discovery.  In  political revolutions experience quickly demonstrates the error  of a false doctrine and forces men to abandon it.    Thus at the end of the Directory the application of Jacobin  beliefs had led France to such a degree of ruin, poverty, and  despair that the wildest Jacobins themselves had to renounce  their system.  Nothing survived of their theories except a few  principles which cannot be verified by experience, such as the  universal happiness which equality should bestow upon humanity.      2.  The beginnings of the Reformation and its first disciples.      The Reformation was finally to exercise a profound influence upon  the sentiments and moral ideas of a great proportion of mankind.  Modest in its beginnings, it was at first a simple struggle  against the abuses of the clergy, and, from a practical point of  view, a return to the prescriptions of the Gospel.  It never  constituted, as has been claimed, an aspiration towards freedom  of thought.  Calvin was as intolerant as Robespierre, and all the  theorists of the age considered that the religion of subjects  must be that of the prince who governed them.  Indeed in every  country where the Reformation was established the sovereign  replaced the Pope of Rome, with the same rights and the same  powers.    In France, in default of publicity and means of communication,  the new faith spread slowly enough at first.  It was about 1520  that Luther recruited a few adepts, and only towards 1535 was the  new belief sufficiently widespread for men to consider it  necessary to burn its disciples.    In conformity with a well-known psychological law, these  executions merely favoured the propagation of the Reformation.  Its first followers included priests and magistrates, but were  principally obscure artisans.  Their conversion was effected  almost exclusively by mental contagion and suggestion.    As soon as a new belief extends itself, we see grouped round it  many persons who are indifferent to the belief, but who find in  it a pretext or opportunity for gratifying their passions or  their greed.  This phenomenon was observed at the time of the  Reformation in many countries, notably in Germany and in England.    Luther having taught that the clergy had no need of wealth, the  German lords found many merits in a faith which enabled them to  seize upon the goods of the Church.  Henry VIII. enriched  himself by a similar operation.  Sovereigns who were often  molested by the Pope could as a rule only look favourably upon a  doctrine which added religious powers to their political powers  and made each of them a Pope.  Far from diminishing the  absolutism of rulers, the Reformation only exaggerated it.      3.  Rational value of the doctrines of the Reformation.      The Reformation overturned all Europe, and came near to ruining  France, of which it made a battle-field for a period of fifty  years.  Never did a cause so insignificant from the rational  point of view produce such great results.    Here is one of the innumerable proofs of the fact that beliefs  are propagated independently of all reason.  The theological  doctrines which aroused men's passions so violently, and notably  those of Calvin, are not even worthy of examination in the light  of rational logic.    Greatly concerned about his salvation, having an excessive fear  of the devil, which his confessor was unable to allay, Luther  sought the surest means of pleasing God that he might avoid Hell.    Having commenced by denying the Pope the right to sell  indulgences, he presently entirely denied his authority, and that  of the Church, condemned religious ceremonies, confession, and  the worship of the saints, and declared that Christians should  have no rules of conduct other than the Bible.  He also  considered that no one could be saved without the grace of God.    This last theory, known as that of predestination, was in Luther  rather uncertain, but was stated precisely by Calvin, who made it  the very foundation of a doctrine to which the majority of  Protestants are still subservient.  According to him: ``From  all eternity God has predestined certain men to be burned and  others to be saved.''  Why this monstrous iniquity?  Simply  because ``it is the will of God.''    Thus according to Calvin, who for that matter merely developed  certain assertions of St. Augustine, an all-powerful God would  amuse Himself by creating living beings simply in order to burn  them during all eternity, without paying any heed to their acts  or merits.  It is marvellous that such revolting insanity could  for such a length of time subjugate so many minds--marvellous  that it does so still.[1]        [1] The doctrine of predestination is still taught in Protestant  catechisms, as is proved by the following passage extracted from  the last edition of an official catechism for which I sent to  Edinburgh:    ``By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some  men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and  others foreordained to everlasting death.    ``These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are  particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so  certain and definite that it cannot be either increased or  diminished.    ``Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before  the foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal  and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure  of His will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of  His mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or  good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing  in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto;  and all to the praise of his glorious grace.    ``As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath He, by the  eternal and most free purpose of His will, foreordained all the  means thereunto.  Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in  Adam, are redeemed by Christ; are effectually called unto faith  in Christ by His spirit working in due season; are justified,  adopted, sanctified, and kept by His power through faith unto  salvation.  Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually  called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect  only.''        The psychology of Calvin is not without affinity with that of  Robespierre.  Like the latter, the master of the pure truth, he  sent to death those who would not accept his doctrines.  God, he  stated, wishes ``that one should put aside all humanity when it  is a question of striving for his glory.''    The case of Calvin and his disciples shows that matters which  rationally are the most contradictory become perfectly reconciled  in minds which are hypnotised by a belief.  In the eyes of  rational logic, it seems impossible to base a morality upon the  theory of predestination, since whatever they do men are sure of  being either saved or damned.  However, Calvin had no difficulty  in erecting a most severe morality upon this totally illogical  basis.  Considering themselves the elect of God, his disciples  were so swollen by pride and the sense of their own dignity that  they felt obliged to serve as models in their conduct.      4.  Propagation of the Reformation.      The new faith was propagated not by speech, still less by process  of reasoning, but by the mechanism described in our preceding  work: that is, by the influence of affirmation, repetition,  mental contagion, and prestige.  At a much later date  revolutionary ideas were spread over France in the same fashion.    Persecution, as we have already remarked, only favoured this  propagation.  Each execution led to fresh conversions, as was  seen in the early years of the Christian Church.  Anne Dubourg,  Parliamentary councillor, condemned to be burned alive, marched  to the stake exhorting the crowd to be converted.  ``His  constancy,'' says a witness, ``made more Protestants among the  young men of the colleges than the books of Calvin.''    To prevent the condemned from speaking to the people their  tongues were cut out before they were burned.  The horror of  their sufferings was increased by attaching the victims to an  iron chain, which enabled the executioners to plunge them into  the fire and withdraw them several times in succession.    But nothing induced the Protestants to retract, even the offer of  an amnesty after they had felt the fire.    In 1535 Francis I., forsaking his previous tolerance, ordered six  fires to be lighted simultaneously in Paris.  The Convention, as  we know, limited itself to a single guillotine in the same city.  It is probable that the sufferings of the victims were not very  excruciating; the insensibility of the Christian martyrs had  already been remarked.  Believers are hypnotised by their faith,  and we know to-day that certain forms of hypnotism engender  complete insensibility.    The new faith progressed rapidly.  In 1560 there were two  thousand reformed churches in France, and many great lords, at  first indifferent enough, adhered to the new doctrine.      5.  Conflict between different religious"]]]
