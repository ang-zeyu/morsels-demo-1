At the middle Neosho station in 1958, this species was taken more  readily by use of the shocker at night than by day (Table 9, p. 402).      #Moxostoma erythrurum# (Rafinesque)    Golden Redhorse    The golden redhorse was abundant at the upper Neosho station, rare at  the middle Neosho station, and did not occur in collections at other  stations. This species was taken most frequently over gravel- or  rubble-bottoms in small pools below riffles, and was especially  susceptible to collection by means of the shocker.    Twenty-nine golden redhorse of the 1957 year-class, taken at the upper  Neosho station on 9 September 1958, were 6.2 to 8.6 inches in total  length (average 7.4 inches); 26 individuals of the same year-class  caught on 21 August 1959 were 9.3 to 13.5 inches in total length  (average 10.9 inches).      #Cyprinus carpio# Linnaeus    Carp    The carp decreased in abundance from 1957 to 1959 at the upper and  middle Marais des Cygnes station and at the middle and lower Neosho  stations. Carp were more abundant in the Marais des Cygnes than in the  Neosho, although the largest number in any single collection was found  in one pool at the upper Neosho station in 1958.    Carp were taken most commonly in quiet water near brush or other cover.  At the middle Neosho station, collecting was most effective between the  hours of 6:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and least effective between 12:30 p.m.  and 6:30 p.m. (Table 9, p. 402). Ripe males were taken as early as  19 April (16.1 inches, 19.4 inches T. L.) and as late as 30 July (16  inches T. L.) at the middle Neosho station. Ripe females were taken as  early as 19 April at the middle Neosho station (19.2 inches T. L.) and  as late as 7 July at the lower Neosho station (16 inches T. L.).  Young-of-the-year were taken first at the middle Marais des Cygnes on 8  July 1957. They were recorded on later dates at the upper Marais des  Cygnes and at the lower and middle Neosho stations.      #Notemigonus crysoleucas# (Mitchill)    Golden Shiner    The golden shiner was taken rarely at the upper Marais des Cygnes  station in 1958 and 1959 and at the middle Marais des Cygnes station in  1957 and 1958. At the middle Neosho station _Notemigonus_ was seined  from a pond that is flooded frequently by the river, but never was taken  in the mainstream.      #Semotilus atromaculatus# (Mitchill)    Creek Chub    The creek chub was taken only at the upper stations on both rivers. It  increased in abundance at the upper Neosho station from 1957 to 1959,  and was not taken in the upper Marais des Cygnes until 1959.      #Hybopsis storeriana# (Kirtland)    Silver Chub    A single specimen from the lower Marais des Cygnes station provides the  only record of the species from the Marais des Cygnes system in Kansas,  and is the only silver chub that I found in either river in 1957-1959.  The species is taken often in the Kansas and Arkansas rivers.      #Hybopsis x-punctata# Hubbs and Crowe    Gravel Chub    The gravel chub, present only at the lower and middle Neosho stations,  occupied moderate currents over clean (free of silt) gravel bottom. The  gravel chub was not taken in 1957, was rare at both Neosho stations in  1958, became common at the lower Neosho station in part of 1959, but was  never numerous at the middle Neosho station. Dr. F. B. Cross recorded  the species as \"rare\" in 1952 at a collection site near my middle Neosho  station, but larger numbers were taken then than in any of my  collections at that station. The population was probably reduced by  drought, and recovery was comparatively slow following restoration of  flow.    Young-of-the-year and adults were common in collections from riffles at  the lower Neosho station from 1 July through 8 July, 1959. I obtained  only one specimen in intensive collections in the same area on 25, 26,  and 27 August. Seemingly the species had moved off shallow riffles into  areas not sampled effectively by seining.      #Phenacobius mirabilis# (Girard)    Sucker-mouthed Minnow    The sucker-mouthed minnow was common at the middle Marais des Cygnes  station but was not taken at the upper and lower stations until 1959,  when it was rare. At the middle and lower Neosho stations this fish  increased in abundance from 1957 to 1959; at the upper station,  sucker-mouthed minnows were not taken until 1959 when collections were  made on the White farm. There, the species was common immediately below  a low-head dam, but was not taken in extensive collections on the Bosch  Farm in 1959.    The species was most common immediately below riffles, or in other areas  having clean gravel bottom in the current. On 5 June, 1959, many  individuals were taken at night (11:30 p.m.) on a shallow gravel riffle  (four inches in depth) where none had been found in a collection at 5:00  p.m. on the same date.    Young-of-the-year were taken at the lower Neosho station on 24 June,  1959, and commonly thereafter in the summer.      #Notropis rubellus# (Agassiz)    Rosy-faced Shiner    In 1958, the rosy-faced shiner was taken rarely at the lower stations on  both streams. This species is common in smaller streams tributary to the  lower portions of the two rivers, and probably occurs in the mainstream  only as \"overflow\" from tributaries. Possibly, during drought,  rosy-faced shiners found suitable habitat in the mainstream of Neosho  and Marais des Cygnes rivers, but re-occupied tributary streams as their  flow increased with favorable precipitation, leaving diminishing  populations in the mainstream.      #Notropis umbratilis# (Girard)    Red-finned Shiner    The red-finned shiner, most abundant at the upper Neosho station,  occurred at all stations except the upper Marais des Cygnes. This fish  seems to prefer small streams, not highly turbid, having clean, hard  bottoms. It is a pool-dwelling, pelagic species.      #Notropis camurus# (Jordan and Meek)    Blunt-faced Shiner    The blunt-faced shiner was taken only in 1957, at the middle Neosho  station, where it was rare. This species, abundant in clear streams  tributary to the Neosho River (field data, State Biological Survey) may  have used the mainstream as a refugium during drought. The few specimens  obtained in 1957 possibly represent a relict population that remained in  the mainstream after flow in tributaries was restored by increased  rainfall.      #Notropis lutrensis# (Baird and Girard)    Red Shiner    The red shiner, abundant in 1952 (early stage of drought), was  consistently the most abundant fish in my collections in the Marais des  Cygnes and at the lower and middle Neosho stations. However, the  abundance declined from 1957 to 1959 at the two Neosho stations. At the  upper Neosho station the species was fourth in abundance in 1957, and  third in 1958 and 1959 (Table 12).    The red shiner is pelagic in habit and occurs primarily in pools, though  it frequently inhabits adjacent riffles. Collections by seining along a  gravel bar at the lower station showed this fish to be most abundant in  shallow, quiet water over mud bottom, or at the head of a gravel bar in  relatively quiet water. At the lower end of the gravel bar in water one  to four feet deep, with a shallow layer of silt over gravel bottom and a  slight eddy-current, red shiners were replaced by ghost shiners or river  carpsucker young-of-the-year as the dominant fish.    Fifty-nine dyed individuals were released in an eddy at the lower end  of a gravel bar at the middle Neosho station on 5 June, 1959. Some of  these fish still were present in this area when a collection was made 30  hours later. No colored fish were taken in collections from quiet water  at the upper end of the gravel bar. A swift riffle intervening between  the latter area and the area of release may have impeded their movement.  Forty-six individuals, released at the head of the same gravel bar on 10  June, 1959, immediately swam slowly upstream through quiet water and  were soon joined by other minnows. These fish did not form a  well-organized school, but moved about independently, with individuals  or groups variously dropping out or rejoining the aggregation until all  colored fish disappeared about 50 feet upstream from the point of  release.    Evidence of inshore movement at night was obtained on 8 June, 1959, in a  shallow backwater, having gravel bottom, at the head of a gravel bar at  the middle Neosho station. A collection made in the afternoon contained  no red shiners, but they were abundant in the same area after dark.    In Kansas, red shiners breed in May, June, and July. Minckley  (1959:421-422) described behavior that apparently was associated with  spawning. Because of its abundance, the red shiner is one of the most  important forage fishes in Kansas streams, and frequently is used as a  bait minnow.      #Notropis volucellus# (Cope)    Mimic Shiner    The mimic shiner was taken only rarely at the two lower Neosho stations.  This species, like _N. camurus_, is normally more common in clear  tributaries than in the Neosho River, and probably frequents the  mainstream only during drought.      #Notropis buchanani# Meek    Ghost Shiner    Field records of the State Biological Survey indicate that the ghost  shiner was common in the mainstream of the lower Neosho River during  drought. In 1957, the species was abundant at the lower and middle  stations on the Neosho River and at the lower Marais des Cygnes station.    Collections at all stations show that the species has a definite  preference for eddies--relatively quiet water, but adjacent to the  strong current of the mainstream rather than in backwater remote from  the channel. The bottom-type over which the ghost shiner was found  varied from mud to gravel or rubble.      #Notropis stramineus# (Cope)    Sand Shiner    The sand shiner was taken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/348"],[0,"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica (#5)"],[1,"n, of  Sinon, the return of the Achaeans from Tenedos, the actual Sack of Troy,  the division of spoils and the burning of the city.    Lesches or Lescheos (as Pausanias calls him) of Pyrrha or Mitylene is  dated at about 660 B.C. In his \"Little Iliad\" he undertook to elaborate  the \"Sack\" as related by Arctinus. His work included the adjudgment of  the arms of Achilles to Odysseus, the madness of Aias, the bringing  of Philoctetes from Lemnos and his cure, the coming to the war of  Neoptolemus who slays Eurypylus, son of Telephus, the making of the  wooden horse, the spying of Odysseus and his theft, along with Diomedes,  of the Palladium: the analysis concludes with the admission of the  wooden horse into Troy by the Trojans. It is known, however (Aristotle,  \"Poetics\", xxiii; Pausanias, x, 25-27), that the \"Little Iliad\" also  contained a description of the sack of Troy. It is probable that this  and other superfluous incidents disappeared after the Alexandrian  arrangement of the poems in the Cycle, either as the result of some  later recension, or merely through disuse. Or Proclus may have thought  it unnecessary to give the accounts by Lesches and Arctinus of the same  incident.    The \"Cyprian Lays\", ascribed to Stasinus of Cyprus [1114] (but also to  Hegesinus of Salamis) was designed to do for the events preceding the  action of the \"Iliad\" what Arctinus had done for the later phases of the  Trojan War. The \"Cypria\" begins with the first causes of the war, the  purpose of Zeus to relieve the overburdened earth, the apple of  discord, the rape of Helen. Then follow the incidents connected with the  gathering of the Achaeans and their ultimate landing in Troy; and the  story of the war is detailed up to the quarrel between Achilles and  Agamemnon with which the \"Iliad\" begins.    These four poems rounded off the story of the \"Iliad\", and it only  remained to connect this enlarged version with the \"Odyssey\". This was  done by means of the \"Returns\", a poem in five books ascribed to Agias  or Hegias of Troezen, which begins where the \"Sack of Troy\" ends. It  told of the dispute between Agamemnon and Menelaus, the departure from  Troy of Menelaus, the fortunes of the lesser heroes, the return and  tragic death of Agamemnon, and the vengeance of Orestes on Aegisthus.  The story ends with the return home of Menelaus, which brings the  general narrative up to the beginning of the \"Odyssey\".    But the \"Odyssey\" itself left much untold: what, for example, happened  in Ithaca after the slaying of the suitors, and what was the ultimate  fate of Odysseus? The answer to these questions was supplied by the  \"Telegony\", a poem in two books by Eugammon of Cyrene (fl. 568 B.C.).  It told of the adventures of Odysseus in Thesprotis after the killing  of the Suitors, of his return to Ithaca, and his death at the hands  of Telegonus, his son by Circe. The epic ended by disposing of the  surviving personages in a double marriage, Telemachus wedding Circe, and  Telegonus Penelope.    The end of the Cycle marks also the end of the Heroic Age.          The Homeric Hymns    The collection of thirty-three Hymns, ascribed to Homer, is the last  considerable work of the Epic School, and seems, on the whole, to be  later than the Cyclic poems. It cannot be definitely assigned either  to the Ionian or Continental schools, for while the romantic element is  very strong, there is a distinct genealogical interest; and in matters  of diction and style the influences of both Hesiod and Homer are  well-marked. The date of the formation of the collection as such is  unknown. Diodorus Siculus (temp. Augustus) is the first to mention  such a body of poetry, and it is likely enough that this is, at least  substantially, the one which has come down to us. Thucydides quotes the  Delian \"Hymn to Apollo\", and it is possible that the Homeric corpus of  his day also contained other of the more important hymns. Conceivably  the collection was arranged in the Alexandrine period.    Thucydides, in quoting the \"Hymn to Apollo\", calls it PROOIMION, which  ordinarily means a 'prelude' chanted by a rhapsode before recitation of  a lay from Homer, and such hymns as Nos. vi, xxxi, xxxii, are  clearly preludes in the strict sense; in No. xxxi, for example, after  celebrating Helios, the poet declares he will next sing of the 'race of  mortal men, the demi-gods'. But it may fairly be doubted whether  such Hymns as those to \"Demeter\" (ii), \"Apollo\" (iii), \"Hermes\" (iv),  \"Aphrodite\" (v), can have been real preludes, in spite of the closing  formula 'and now I will pass on to another hymn'. The view taken by  Allen and Sikes, amongst other scholars, is doubtless right, that  these longer hymns are only technically preludes and show to what  disproportionate lengths a simple literacy form can be developed.    The Hymns to \"Pan\" (xix), to \"Dionysus\" (xxvi), to \"Hestia and Hermes\"  (xxix), seem to have been designed for use at definite religious  festivals, apart from recitations. With the exception perhaps of the  \"Hymn to Ares\" (viii), no item in the collection can be regarded as  either devotional or liturgical.    The Hymn is doubtless a very ancient form; but if no example of extreme  antiquity survive this must be put down to the fact that until the age  of literary consciousness, such things are not preserved.    First, apparently, in the collection stood the \"Hymn to Dionysus\", of  which only two fragments now survive. While it appears to have been a  hymn of the longer type [1115], we have no evidence to show either its  scope or date.    The \"Hymn to Demeter\", extant only in the MS. discovered by Matthiae  at Moscow, describes the seizure of Persephone by Hades, the grief  of Demeter, her stay at Eleusis, and her vengeance on gods and men by  causing famine. In the end Zeus is forced to bring Persephone back from  the lower world; but the goddess, by the contriving of Hades, still  remains partly a deity of the lower world. In memory of her sorrows  Demeter establishes the Eleusinian mysteries (which, however, were  purely agrarian in origin).    This hymn, as a literary work, is one of the finest in the collection.  It is surely Attic or Eleusinian in origin. Can we in any way fix its  date? Firstly, it is certainly not later than the beginning of the sixth  century, for it makes no mention of Iacchus, and the Dionysiac  element was introduced at Eleusis at about that period. Further,  the insignificance of Triptolemus and Eumolpus point to considerable  antiquity, and the digamma is still active. All these considerations  point to the seventh century as the probable date of the hymn.    The \"Hymn to Apollo\" consists of two parts, which beyond any doubt were  originally distinct, a Delian hymn and a Pythian hymn.    The Delian hymn describes how Leto, in travail with Apollo, sought out  a place in which to bear her son, and how Apollo, born in Delos, at once  claimed for himself the lyre, the bow, and prophecy. This part of the  existing hymn ends with an encomium of the Delian festival of Apollo and  of the Delian choirs. The second part celebrates the founding of Pytho  (Delphi) as the oracular seat of Apollo. After various wanderings the  god comes to Telphus, near Haliartus, but is dissuaded by the nymph of  the place from settling there and urged to go on to Pytho where, after  slaying the she-dragon who nursed Typhaon, he builds his temple. After  the punishment of Telphusa for her deceit in giving him no warning of  the dragoness at Pytho, Apollo, in the form of a dolphin, brings certain  Cretan shipmen to Delphi to be his priests; and the hymn ends with a  charge to these men to behave orderly and righteously.    The Delian part is exclusively Ionian and insular both in style and  sympathy; Delos and no other is Apollo's chosen seat: but the second  part is as definitely continental; Delos is ignored and Delphi alone is  the important centre of Apollo's worship. From this it is clear that  the two parts need not be of one date--The first, indeed, is ascribed  (Scholiast on Pindar \"Nem\". ii, 2) to Cynaethus of Chios (fl. 504 B.C.),  a date which is obviously far too low; general considerations point  rather to the eighth century. The second part is not later than 600  B.C.; for 1) the chariot-races at Pytho, which commenced in 586 B.C.,  are unknown to the writer of the hymn, 2) the temple built by Trophonius  and Agamedes for Apollo (ll. 294-299) seems to have been still standing  when the hymn was written, and this temple was burned in 548. We may at  least be sure that the first part is a Chian work, and that the second  was composed by a continental poet familiar with Delphi.    The \"Hymn to Hermes\" differs from others in its burlesque, quasi-comic  character, and it is also the best-known of the Hymns to English readers  in consequence of Shelley's translation.    After a brief narrative of the birth of Hermes, the author goes on to  show how he won a place among the gods. First the new-born child found a  tortoise and from its shell contrived the lyre; next, with much cunning  circumstance, he stole Apollo's cattle and, when charged with the theft  by Apollo, forced that god to appear in undignified guise before the  tribunal of Zeus. Zeus seeks to reconcile the pair, and Hermes by  the gift of the lyre wins Apollo's friendship and purchases various  prerogatives, a share in divination, the lordship of herds and animals,  and the office of messenger from the gods to Hades.    The Hymn is hard to date. Hermes' lyre has seven strings and the  invention of the seven-stringed lyre is ascribed to Terpander (flor.  676 B.C.). The hymn must therefore be later than that date, though  Terpander, according to Weir Smyth [1116], may have only modified the  scale of the lyre; yet while the burlesque character precludes an early  date, this feature is far removed, as Allen and Sikes remark, from the  silliness of the \"Battle of the Frogs and Mice\","]]]
