The upper part of the t.t. is filled with air:  allow this to escape for a few seconds; then move a receiver over  the orifice, and fill it with gas. As soon as the lamp is taken  away, remove the d.t. from the water. The gas contracts, on  cooling, and if not removed, water will be drawn over, and the  t.t. will be broken. Let the t.t. hang on the r.s. till cool.    With glass plates take out the receivers, leaving them covered,  mouth upward (Fig. 8), with little or no water inside. When cool,  the t.t. may be cleaned with water, by covering its mouth with  the thumb or hand, and shaking it vigorously.    What elements, and how many, in KClO3? In Mn02? It is evident  that each of these compounds contains O. Why, then, could we not  have taken either separately, instead of mixing the two? This  could have been done at a sufficiently high temperature. Mu02  requires a much higher temperature for dissociation, i.e.  separation into its elements, than KClO3, while a mixture of the  two causes O to come off from KClO3 at a lower temperature than  if alone. It is not known that Mn02 suffers any change.    Each molecule of potassium chlorate undergoes the following  change:--      Potassium Chlorate = Potassium Chloride + Oxygen  KClO3              = KCl         + 3 O.      Is this analysis or synthesis? Complete the equation, by using  weights, and explain it. Notice whether the right- hand member of  the equation has the same number of atoms as the left. Has  anything been lost or gained? What element has heat separated?  Does the experiment show whether O is very soluble in water? How  many grams of O are obtainable from 122.58 g. KCIO3? PROPERTIES.    23. Combustion of Carbon.    OXYGEN Experiment 14.--Examine the gas in one of the receivers.  Put a lighted splinter into the receiver, sliding along the glass  cover. Remove it, blow it out, and put in again while glowing. Is  it re-kindled? Repeat till it will no longer burn. Is the gas a  supporter of combustion? How did the combustion compare with that  in air? Is it probable that air is pure O? Why did the flame at  last go out? Has the O been destroyed, or chemically united with  something else?    Wood is in part C. CO2 is formed by the combustion; name it. The  equation is C + 2O = CO2. Affix the names and weights. Is CO2 a  supporter of combustion? Note that when C is burned with plenty  of O, CO2 is always formed, and that no matter how great the  conflagration, the union is atom by atom. Combustion, as here  shown, is only a rapid union of O with some other substance, as C  or H.    24. Combustion of Sulphur.    Experiment 15.--Hollow out one end of a piece of electric-light  pencil, or of crayon, 3 cm. long, and attach it to a Cu wire  (Fig. 9). Put into this a piece of S as large as a pea, ignite it  by holding in the flame, and then hold it in a receiver of O.  Note the color and brightness of the flame, and compare with the  same in the air. Also note the color and odor of the product. The  new gas is SO2. Name it, and write the equation for its  production from S and O. How do you almost daily perform a  similar experiment? Is the product a supporter of combustion?    25. Combustion of Phosphorus.    Experiment 16.--With forceps, which should always be used in  handling this element, put a bit of P, half as large as the S  above,into the crayon, called a deflagrating-spoon. Heat another  wire, touch it to the P, and at once lower the latter into a  receiver of O. Notice the combustion, the color of the flame and  of the product. After removing, be sure to burn every bit of P by  holding it in a flame, as it is liable to take fire if left. The  product of the combustion is a union of what two elements? Is it  an oxide? Its symbol is P2O5. Write the equation, using symbols,  names, and weights. Towards the close of the experiment, when the  O is nearly all combined, P2O3 is formed, as it is also when P  oxidizes at a low temperature. Name it and write the equation.    26. Combustion of Iron.    Experiment 17.--Take in the forceps a piece of iron picture-cord  wire 6 or 8cm long, hold one end in the flame for an instant,  then dip it into some S. Enough S will adhere to be set on fire  by holding it in the flame again. Then at once dip it into a  receiver of O with a little water in the bottom. The iron will  burn with scintillations. Is this analysis or synthesis? What  elements combine? A watch-spring, heated to take out the temper,  may be used, but picture-wire is better.    The product is Fe3O4. Write the equation. How much Fe by weight  in the formula? How much O? What per cent by weight of Fe in the  compound? Multiply the fractional part by 100. What per cent of  0? Whatper cent of C0 .is C? O2? Find the percentage composition  of SO2. P2O5.    From the last five experiments what do you infer of the tendency  of O to unite with other elements?    27. Oxygen is a Gas without Color, Odor, or Taste.    It is chemically a very active element; that is, it unites with  almost everything. Fluorine is the only element with which it  will not combine. When oxygen combines with a single element,  what is the compound called? We have found that O makes up a  certain portion of the air; later, we shall see how large the  proportion is. Its tendency to combine with almost everything is  a reason for the decay, rust, and oxidation of so many  substances, and for conflagrations, great and small. New  compounds are thusformed, of which O constitutes one factor.  Water, H2O, is only a chemical union of O and H. Iron rust, Fe2O3  and H2O, is composed of O, Fe, and water. The burning of wood or  of coal gives rise to carbon dioxide, CO2, and water. Decay of  animal and vegetable matter is hastened by this all-pervading  element. O forms a portion of all animal and vegetable matter, of  almost all rocks and minerals, and of water. It is the most  abundant of all elements, and makes up from one-half to two-  thirds of the earth's surface. Compute the proportion of it, by  weight, in water, H2O. It is the union of O in the air with C and  H in our blood that keeps up the heat of the body and supports  life. See page 81.    There are many ways of preparing this element besides the one  given above. It may be obtained from water (Experiment 38) and  from many other compounds, e.g. by heating mercury oxide,  HgO.    CHAPTER VII.    NITROGEN.    28. Separation.    Experiment 18.--Fasten a piece of electric-light pencil, or of  crayon, to a wire, as in Experiment 15, and bend the wire so it  will reach half-way to the bottom of a receiver. Using forceps,  put into the crayon a small piece of phosphorus. Pass the wire up  through the orifice in the shelf of a p.t. (pneumatic trough),  having water at least l cm. above the shelf. Heat another wire,  touch it to the P, and quickly invert an empty receiver over the  P, having the mouth under water, so as to admit no air (Fig. 10).  Let the P burn as long as it will, then remove the wire and the  crayon, letting in no air. Note the color of the product, and  leave till it is tolerably clear, then remove the receiver with a  glass plate, leaving the water in the bottom.    Do the fumes resemble those of Experiment 16? Does it seem likely  (Fig 10.) that part of the air is O? Why a part only? Find what  proportion of the receiver is filled with water by measuring the  water with a graduate; then fill it with water and measure that;  compute the percentage which the former is of the latter. What  proportion of the air, then, is O? What was the only means of  escape for the P2O6, and P2O2 formed? These products are solids.  Are they soluble in water? Compute the percentage composition,  always by weight, of P2O2 and P2O5.    The gas left in the receiver is evidently not O. Experiment 19  will prove this conclusively, and show the properties of the new  gas.    29. Properties.    Experiment 19.--When the white cloud has disappeared, slide the  plate along, and insert a burning stick; try one that still  glows.    See whether the P and S on the end of a match will burn. Is the  gas a supporter of combustion?  Since it does not unite with C,  S, or P, is it an active or a passive element?  Compare it with  O. Air is about 14 1/2 times as heavy as H. Which is heavier, air  or N?  See page 12. Air or O?    Write out the chief properties, physical and chemical, of N, as  found in this experiment.    30. Inactivity of N.--N will scarcely unite chemically except on  being set free from compounds. It has, however, an intense  affinity for boron, and will even go through a carbon crucible to  unite with it. It is not combined with O in the air; but the two  form a mixture (page 86), of which N makes up four-fifths, its  use being to dilute the O. What would be the effect, in case of a  fire, if air were pure O?  What effect on the human system?    Growing plants need a great deal of N, but they are incapable of  making use of that in the air, on account of the chemical  inactivity of the element. Their supply comes from compounds in  earth, water, and air. By reason of its inertness N is very  easily set free from its compounds. For this reason it is a  constituent of most explosives, as gunpowder, nitro-glycerine,  dynamite, etc. These solids, by heat or concussion, are suddenly  changed to gases, which thereby occupy much more space, causing  an explosion.    Nitrogen exists in many compounds, such as the nitrates; but the  great source of it all is the atmosphere. See page 85.    CHAPTER VIII.    HYDROGEN.    31. Preparation.    Experiment 20.--Prepare apparatus as for making O. Be sure that  the cork perfectly fits both d.t. and t.t., or the H will escape.  Cover 5 g. granulated Zn, in the t.t., with 10 cc. H2O, and add 5  cc. chlorhydric acid, HCl. Adjust as for O (Fig. 7), except that  no heat is to be applied.

Even in the most purely logical realms, it  is insight that first arrives at what is new.    Where instinct and reason do sometimes conflict is in regard to single  beliefs, held instinctively, and held with such determination that no  degree of inconsistency with other beliefs leads to their abandonment.  Instinct, like all human faculties, is liable to error. Those in whom  reason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards themselves,  though all admit it in regard to others. Where instinct is least liable  to error is in practical matters as to which right judgment is a help to  survival; friendship and hostility in others, for instance, are often  felt with extraordinary discrimination through very careful disguises.  But even in such matters a wrong impression may be given by reserve or  flattery; and in matters less directly practical, such as philosophy  deals with, very strong instinctive beliefs may be wholly mistaken, as  we may come to know through their perceived inconsistency with other  equally strong beliefs. It is such considerations that necessitate the  harmonising mediation of reason, which tests our beliefs by their mutual  compatibility, and examines, in doubtful cases, the possible sources of  error on the one side and on the other. In this there is no opposition  to instinct as a whole, but only to blind reliance upon some one  interesting aspect of instinct to the exclusion of other more  commonplace but not less trustworthy aspects. It is such onesidedness,  not instinct itself, that reason aims at correcting.    These more or less trite maxims may be illustrated by application to  Bergson's advocacy of \"intuition\" as against \"intellect.\" There are, he  says, \"two profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. The first  implies that we move round the object; the second that we enter into it.  The first depends on the point of view at which we are placed and on the  symbols by which we express ourselves. The second neither depends on a  point of view nor relies on any symbol. The first kind of knowledge may  be said to stop at the _relative_; the second, in those cases where it  is possible, to attain the _absolute_.\"[7] The second of these, which is  intuition, is, he says, \"the kind of intellectual _sympathy_ by which  one places oneself within an object in order to coincide with what is  unique in it and therefore inexpressible\" (p. 6). In illustration, he  mentions self-knowledge: \"there is one reality, at least, which we all  seize from within, by intuition and not by simple analysis. It is our  own personality in its flowing through time--our self which endures\"  (p. 8). The rest of Bergson's philosophy consists in reporting, through  the imperfect medium of words, the knowledge gained by intuition, and  the consequent complete condemnation of all the pretended knowledge  derived from science and common sense.      [7] _Introduction to Metaphysics_, p. 1.    This procedure, since it takes sides in a conflict of instinctive  beliefs, stands in need of justification by proving the greater  trustworthiness of the beliefs on one side than of those on the other.  Bergson attempts this justification in two ways--first, by explaining  that intellect is a purely practical faculty designed to secure  biological success; secondly, by mentioning remarkable feats of instinct  in animals, and by pointing out characteristics of the world which,  though intuition can apprehend them, are baffling to intellect as he  interprets it.    Of Bergson's theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty  developed in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true  beliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we  know of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of man:  if the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred  history is presumably untrue. If, on the other hand, we agree with M.  Bergson in thinking that evolution took place as Darwin believed, then  it is not only intellect, but all our faculties, that have been  developed under the stress of practical utility. Intuition is seen at  its best where it is directly useful--for example, in regard to other  people's characters and dispositions. Bergson apparently holds that  capacity for this kind of knowledge is less explicable by the struggle  for existence than, for example, capacity for pure mathematics. Yet the  savage deceived by false friendship is likely to pay for his mistake  with his life; whereas even in the most civilised societies men are not  put to death for mathematical incompetence. All the most striking of his  instances of intuition in animals have a very direct survival value. The  fact is, of course, that both intuition and intellect have been  developed because they are useful, and that, speaking broadly, they are  useful when they give truth and become harmful when they give falsehood.  Intellect, in civilised man, like artistic capacity, has occasionally  been developed beyond the point where it is useful to the individual;  intuition, on the other hand, seems on the whole to diminish as  civilisation increases. Speaking broadly, it is greater in children than  in adults, in the uneducated than in the educated. Probably in dogs it  exceeds anything to be found in human beings. But those who find in  these facts a recommendation of intuition ought to return to running  wild in the woods, dyeing themselves with woad and living on hips and  haws.    Let us next examine whether intuition possesses any such infallibility  as Bergson claims for it. The best instance of it, according to him, is  our acquaintance with ourselves; yet self-knowledge is proverbially rare  and difficult. Most men, for example, have in their nature meannesses,  vanities, and envies of which they are quite unconscious, though even  their best friends can perceive them without any difficulty. It is true  that intuition has a convincingness which is lacking to intellect: while  it is present, it is almost impossible to doubt its truth. But if it  should appear, on examination, to be at least as fallible as intellect,  its greater subjective certainty becomes a demerit, making it only the  more irresistibly deceptive. Apart from self-knowledge, one of the most  notable examples of intuition is the knowledge people believe themselves  to possess of those with whom they are in love: the wall between  different personalities seems to become transparent, and people think  they see into another soul as into their own. Yet deception in such  cases is constantly practised with success; and even where there is no  intentional deception, experience gradually proves, as a rule, that the  supposed insight was illusory, and that the slower, more groping methods  of the intellect are in the long run more reliable.    Bergson maintains that intellect can only deal with things in so far as  they resemble what has been experienced in the past, while intuition has  the power of apprehending the uniqueness and novelty that always belong  to each fresh moment. That there is something unique and new at every  moment, is certainly true; it is also true that this cannot be fully  expressed by means of intellectual concepts. Only direct acquaintance  can give knowledge of what is unique and new. But direct acquaintance of  this kind is given fully in sensation, and does not require, so far as I  can see, any special faculty of intuition for its apprehension. It is  neither intellect nor intuition, but sensation, that supplies new data;  but when the data are new in any remarkable manner, intellect is much  more capable of dealing with them than intuition would be. The hen with  a brood of ducklings no doubt has intuitions which seem to place her  inside them, and not merely to know them analytically; but when the  ducklings take to the water, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be  illusory, and the hen is left helpless on the shore. Intuition, in fact,  is an aspect and development of instinct, and, like all instinct, is  admirable in those customary surroundings which have moulded the habits  of the animal in question, but totally incompetent as soon as the  surroundings are changed in a way which demands some non-habitual mode  of action.    The theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of  philosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals, or  to savages, or even to most civilised men. It is hardly to be supposed,  therefore, that the rapid, rough and ready methods of instinct or  intuition will find in this field a favourable ground for their  application. It is the older kinds of activity, which bring out our  kinship with remote generations of animal and semi-human ancestors, that  show intuition at its best. In such matters as self-preservation and  love, intuition will act sometimes (though not always) with a swiftness  and precision which are astonishing to the critical intellect. But  philosophy is not one of the pursuits which illustrate our affinity with  the past: it is a highly refined, highly civilised pursuit, demanding,  for its success, a certain liberation from the life of instinct, and  even, at times, a certain aloofness from all mundane hopes and fears. It  is not in philosophy, therefore, that we can hope to see intuition at  its best. On the contrary, since the true objects of philosophy, and the  habits of thought demanded for their apprehension, are strange, unusual,  and remote, it is here, more almost than anywhere else, that intellect  proves superior to intuition, and that quick unanalysed convictions are  least deserving of uncritical acceptance.    Before embarking upon the somewhat difficult and abstract discussions  which lie before us, it will be well to take a survey of the hopes we  may retain and the hopes we must abandon. The hope of satisfaction to  our more human desires--the hope of "]]]
