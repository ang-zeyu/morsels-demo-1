The  falling of barrels and boxes, the rattling of tin cans, the crashing of  crockery, the howling of the vagrant dogs that were trampled under foot,  only added to the general tumult.    Through the courtesy of Mr. Peet of the American Bible House at  Constantinople, we were provided with letters of introduction to the  missionaries at Kaisarieh, as well as elsewhere along our route through  Asiatic Turkey, and upon them we also had drafts to the amount of our  deposit made at the Bible House before starting. Besides, we owed much to  the hospitality and kindness of these people. The most striking feature of  the missionary work at Kaisarieh is the education of the Armenian women,  whose social position seems to be even more degraded than that of their  Turkish sisters. With the native Armenians, as with the Turks, fleshiness  adds much to the price of a wife. The wife of a missionary is to them an  object both of wonderment and contempt. As she walks along the street,  they will whisper to one another: \"There goes a woman who knows all her  husband's business; and who can manage just as well as himself.\" This will  generally be followed in an undertone by the expression, \"Madana satana,\"  which means, in common parlance, \"a female devil.\" At first it was a  struggle to overcome this ignorant prejudice, and to get girls to come to  the school free of charge; now it is hard to find room for them even when  they are asked to pay for their tuition.    The costume of the Armenian woman is generally of some bright-colored  cloth, prettily trimmed. Her coiffure, always elaborate, sometimes  includes a string of gold coins, encircling the head, or strung down the  plait. A silver belt incloses the waist, and a necklace of coins calls  attention to her pretty neck. When washing clothes by the stream, they  frequently show a gold ring encircling an ankle.    In the simplicity of their costumes, as well as in the fact that they do  not expose the face, the Turkish women stand in strong contrast to the  Armenian. Baggy trousers _a la_ Bloomer, a loose robe skirt opening at the  sides, and a voluminous shawl-like girdle around the waist and body,  constitute the main features of the Turkish indoor costume. On the street  a shroud-like robe called yashmak, usually white, but sometimes crimson,  purple, or black, covers them from head to foot. When we would meet a bevy  of these creatures on the road in the dusk of evening, their white,  fluttering garments would give them the appearance of winged celestials.  The Turkish women are generally timorous of men, and especially so of  foreigners. Those of the rural districts, however, are not so shy as their  city cousins. We frequently met them at work in groups about the villages  or in the open fields, and would sometimes ask for a drink of water. If  they were a party of maidens, as was often the case, they would draw back  and hide behind one another. We would offer one of them a ride on our  \"very nice horses.\" This would cause a general giggle among her  companions, and a drawing of the yashmak closer about the neck and face.      [Illustration: ARABS CONVERSING WITH A TURK.]    The road scenes in the interior provinces are but little varied. One of  the most characteristic features of the Anatolian landscape are the  storks, which come in flocks of thousands from their winter quarters in  Egypt and build summer nests, unmolested, on the village housetops. These,  like the crows, magpies, and swallows, prove valuable allies to the  husbandmen in their war against the locust. A still more serviceable  friend in this direction is the _smarmar_, a pink thrush with black wings.  Besides the various caravan trains of camels, donkeys, horses, and mules,  the road is frequently dotted with ox-carts, run on solid wooden wheels  without tires, and drawn by that peculiar bovine species, the buffalo.  With their distended necks, elevated snouts, and hog-like bristles, these  animals present an ugly appearance, especially when wallowing in mud  puddles.    Now and then in the villages we passed by a primitive flour-mill moved by  a small stream playing upon a horizontal wheel beneath the floor; or, more  primitive still, by a blindfolded donkey plodding ceaselessly around in  his circular path. In the streets we frequently encountered boys and old  men gathering manure for their winter fuel; and now and then a cripple or  invalid would accost us as \"Hakim\" (\"Doctor\"), for the medical work of the  missionaries has given these simple-minded folk the impression that all  foreigners are physicians. Coming up and extending a hand for us to feel  the pulse they would ask us to do something for the disease, which we  could see was rapidly carrying them to the grave.      [Illustration: A KADI EXPOUNDING THE KORAN.]    Our first view of Sivas was obtained from the top of Mount Yildiz, on  which still stands the ruined castle of Mithridates, the Pontine monarch,  whom Lucullus many times defeated, but never conquered. From this point we  made a very rapid descent, crossed the Kizil Irmak for the third time by  an old ruined bridge, and half an hour later saw the \"stars and stripes\"  flying above the U. S. consulate. In the society of our representative,  Mr. Henry M. Jewett, we were destined to spend several weeks; for a day or  two after our arrival, one of us was taken with a slight attack of typhoid  fever, supposed to have been contracted by drinking from the roadside  streams. No better place could have been chosen for such a mishap; for  recovery was speedy in such comfortable quarters, under the care of the  missionary ladies.    The comparative size and prosperity of Sivas, in the midst of rather  barren surroundings, are explained by the fact that it lies at the  converging point of the chief caravan routes between the Euxine,  Euphrates, and Mediterranean. Besides being the capital of Rumili, the  former Seljuk province of Cappadocia, it is the place of residence for a  French and American consular representative, and an agent of the Russian  government for the collection of the war indemnity, stipulated in the  treaty of '78. The dignity of office is here upheld with something of the  pomp and splendor of the East, even by the representative of democratic  America. In our tours with Mr. Jewett we were escorted at the head by a  Circassian _cavass_ (Turkish police), clothed in a long black coat, with a  huge dagger dangling from a belt of cartridges. Another native cavass,  with a broadsword dragging at his side, usually brought up the rear. At  night he was the one to carry the huge lantern, which, according to the  number of candles, is the insignia of rank. \"I must give the Turks what  they want,\" said the consul, with a twinkle in his eye--\"form and red tape.  I would not be a consul in their eyes, if I didn't.\" To illustrate the  formality of Turkish etiquette he told this story: \"A Turk was once  engaged in saving furniture from his burning home, when he noticed that a  bystander was rolling a cigarette. He immediately stopped in his hurry,  struck a match, and offered a light.\"      [Illustration: EVENING HALT IN A VILLAGE.]    The most flagrant example of Turkish formality that came to our notice was  the following address on an official document to the Sultan:          \"The Arbiter; the Absolute; the Soul and Body of the Universe; the      Father of all the sovereigns of the earth; His Excellency, the      Eagle Monarch; the Cause of the never-changing order of things;      the Source of all honor; the Son of the Sultan of Sultans, under      whose feet we are dust, whose awful shadow protects us; Abdul      Hamid II., Son of Abdul Medjid, whose residence is in Paradise;      our glorious Lord, to whose sacred body be given health, and      strength, and endless days; whom Allah keeps in his palace, and on      his throne with joy and glory, forever. Amen.\"        [Illustration: PRIMITIVE WEAVING.]    This is not the flattery of a cringing subordinate, for the same spirit is  revealed in an address by the Sultan himself to his Grand Vizir:          \"Most honored Vizir; Maintainer of the good order of the World;      Director of public affairs with wisdom and judgment; Accomplisher      of the important transactions of mankind with intelligence and      good sense; Consolidator of the edifice of Empire and of Glory;      endowed by the Most High with abundant gifts; and 'Monshir,' at      this time, of my Gate of Felicity; my Vizir Mehmed Pasha, may God      be pleased to preserve him long in exalted dignity.\"      Though the Turks cannot be called lazy, yet they like to take their time.  Patience, they say, belongs to God; hurry, to the devil. Nowhere is this  so well illustrated as in the manner of shopping in Turkey. This was  brought particularly to our notice when we visited the Sivas bazaars to  examine some inlaid silverware, for which the place is celebrated. The  customer stands in the street inspecting the articles on exhibition; the  merchant sits on his heels on the booth floor. If the customer is of some  position in life, he climbs up and sits down on a level with the merchant.  If he is a foreigner, the merchant is quite deferential. A merchant is not  a merchant at all, but a host entertaining a guest. Coffee is served; then  a cigarette rolled up and handed to the \"guest,\" while the various social  and other local topics are freely discussed. After coffee and smoking the  question of purchase is gradually approached; not abruptly, as that would  involve a loss of dignity; but circumspectly, as if the buying of anything  were a mere afterthought. Maybe, after half an hour, the customer has  indicated what he wants, and after discussing the quality of the goods,  the customer asks the price in an off-hand way, as though he were not  particularly interested.

Especially has this been the case with the period immediately  preceding the days of terror. This period has been dispatched in a few  sentences, in the opening chapters of works on the French Revolution--in  some vague generalities on its profligacy and chaotic infamy. We have  had glimpses, through the _Oeil de Boeuf_, at groups of exquisite  gentlemen and gay ladies; abbes who wrote every thing but sermons, and  were free from the censure of not practising what they preached since  they did not preach at all; generals who fought a campaign as  deliberately and ceremoniously as they danced a minuet; statesmen whose  diplomacy was more of the seraglio than the council; painters who  improved on nature, applying the same tricks of art to the landscape as  with powders to their curls; and simpering lips of the Marquise, and  poets whose highest flights were a sonnet to Pompadour, or a pastoral to  a sheep-tending Phillis. Our casual observations of all these people,  however, have been vague and slight, for few have probably had patience  to follow these worthies to their retirement, and look over their  shoulders at the memoirs which every mother's son and daughter of the  set, from the prime minister to the cook, found--it is impossible to  tell how--time to scribble down for the edification of posterity. In the  volumes of Arsene Houssaye before us, these gay but unsubstantial  shadows take flesh and blood, and become the _Men and Women_--the living  realities of the Eighteenth Century. We have here the most piquant  adventures of the _Memoirs_ and the choicest _mots_ of the _Anas_,  culled from the hundreds of volumes which weigh down the shelves of the  French public libraries. Not only indeed have we the run of the _petites  soupers_ of Versailles, but we may wander at will in the coulisses of  the Grand Opera, picking up the latest gossip of Camargo or Sophie  Arnold, enter the foyer of the classic Theatre Francaise, or adjourn to  the Cafe Procope to hear the last joke of Piron, or the latest news from  Fernay. And better than all these, we may mount, _au cinquieme, au  sexieme_, to the lofty yet humble garret of the author or the artist,  and there find, in an age of sickening heartlessness, refreshing scenes  of household sincerity, patient endurance of hardship, showing that even  that depraved age was not utterly devoid of the heroic and the pure. M.  Houssaye is no rigid moralist, he employs no historic pillory, and often  displays the painful flippancy of the modern French school on religious  points, but he does honor to these better traits of humanity when he  meets them. And we are not sure but that the morality of the work is the  more impressive for the absence of the didactic. Here is little danger  of our falling in love with vice, seductive as she appears in the annals  of Louis XV., for we see the rotten canvas as well as the brilliant  scene. We remember with the gaudy blossoms of 1740-60, the ashen fruit  of 1789-'95. It is as hard to select extracts from M. Houssaye's volumes  on account of the _embarras des richesses_, as it would be to choose a  gem or two for our drawing-room from a gallery of Watteau and Greuze, or  a row of Laucret's _passets_. Much as the reader, we doubt not, will  enjoy those we have picked for him, he will still find equal or greater  pleasure in those we have left untouched.    Here are the first steps in the ascent of Madame de Pompadour to that  \"bad eminence\" she attained of virtual though virtueless Queen of  France. The entire sketch is the best life of this celebrated woman with  which we are acquainted:         \"Madame de Pompadour was born in Paris, in 1720. She always       said it was 1722. It is affirmed, that Poisson, her father, at       least the husband of her mother, was a sutler in the army; some       historians state that he was the butcher of the Hospital of the       Invalides, and was condemned to be hung; according to Voltaire,       she was the daughter of a farmer of Ferte-sous-Jouarre. What       matters it, since he who was truly a father to her was the       farmer-general, Lenormant de Tourneheim. This gentleman,       thinking her worthy of his fortune, took her to his home, and       brought her up, as if she had been his own daughter. He gave       her the name of Jeanne-Antoinette. She bore till she was       sixteen years of age this sweet name of Jeanne. From her       infancy, she exhibited a passion for music and drawing. All the       first masters of the day were summoned to the hotel of       Lenormant de Tourneheim. Her masters did not disgust Jeanne       with the fine arts of which she was so fond. Her talent was       soon widely known. Fontenelle, Duclos, and Crebillon, who were       received at the hotel as men of wit, went about every where,       talking of her beauty, her grace, and talent.         \"Madame de Pompadour was an example of a woman that was both       handsome and pretty; the lines of her face possessed all the       harmony and elevation of a creation of Raphael's; but instead       of the elevated sentiment with which that great master animated       his faces, there was the smiling expression of a Parisian       woman. She possessed in the highest degree all that gives to       the face brilliancy, charm, and sportive gayety. No lady at       court had then so noble and coquettish a bearing, such delicate       and attractive features, so elegant and graceful a figure. Her       mother used always to say, 'A king alone is worthy of my       daughter.' Jeanne had an early presentiment of a throne! at       first, from the ambitious longings of her mother; afterward,       because she believed that she was in love with the king. 'She       confessed to me,' says Voltaire, in his memoirs, 'that she had       a secret presentiment that the king would fall in love with       her, and that she had a violent inclination for him.' There is       a time in life when destiny reveals itself. All those who have       succeeded in climbing the rugged mountain of human vanity       relate that, from their earliest youth, dazzling visions       revealed to them their future glory.         \"Well, how was the throne of France to be reached, the very       idea of which made her head turn? In the mean time, full of       genius, always admired, and always listened to, she       familiarized herself with the life of a beautiful queen; she       saw at her feet all the worshippers of the fortune of her       father; she gathered about her poets, artists, and       philosophers, over whom she already threw a royal protection.         \"The farmer-general had a nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles. He was       an amiable young man, and had the character and manners of a       gentleman; he was heir to the immense fortune of the       farmer-general, at least, according to law. Jeanne, on her       side, had some claim to a share of this fortune. It was a very       simple way of making all agreed, by marrying the young people.       Jeanne, as we have seen, was already in love with the king; she       married D'Etioles without shifting her point in view:       Versailles, Versailles, that was her only horizon. Her young       husband became desperately enamored of her; but this passion of       his, which amounted almost to madness, she never felt in the       least. She received it with resignation, as a misfortune that       could not last long.         \"The hotel of the newly-married couple,       _Rue-Croix-des-Petits-Champs_, was established on a lordly       footing; the best company in Paris left the fashionable       _salons_ for that of Madame D'Etioles until that time, there       had never been such a gorgeous display of luxury in France. The       young bride hoped by this means to make something of a noise at       court, and thus excite the curiosity of the king. Day after day       passed away in feasts and brilliant entertainments. Celebrated       actors, poets, artists, and foreigners, all made their       rendezvous at this hotel, the mistress of which was its life       and ornament; all the world went there, in one word, except the       king.\"    The painters are among the pleasantest personages of Mr. Houssaye's  book, as they generally are in whatever society or whatever time we find  them, all the world over. Watteau is familiar to us all, if not from his  works, at second-hand in engravings, or those dainty little china  shepherdesses and shepherds which we have seen on our grandmothers'  mantel-pieces, and which are again emerging from the glass corner  cupboard to the rosewood and mirrored etagere. The following passages  descriptive of his early life, are full of animation:         \"He was born in 1684, at the time the king of France was       bombarding Luxembourg. His family was poor, as a matter of       course. He was put to school just long enough not to learn any       thing. He was never able to read and write without great       difficulty, but it was not in that his strength lay. He learned       early to discover genius in a picture, to copy with a happy       touch the gay face of Nature. There had been painters in his       family, among others, a great uncle, who had died at Antwerp,       without leaving any property. The father of Watteau had little       leaning toward painting; but he was one of those who let men       and things here below take their course. Watteau, therefore,       was permitted to take his. Now Watteau was born a painter. God       had given him the fire of genius, if not genius. His first       master was chance, the greatest of all masters after God. His       father lived in the upper story of a house with its gable-end       to the street. Watteau had his nose out of the window oftener       than over a book; he loved to amuse himself with the varied       spectacle of the street. Sometimes it was the fresh-looking       Flemish peasant-girl,"]]]
