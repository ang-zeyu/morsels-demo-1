The house has been closed for so  long that there will be a great deal to do. Servants must be hired for  both house and grounds.\"    \"I don't want any servants, auntie,\" protested her niece. \"I want to  keep house for father myself. You know that he wanted me to learn, and I  want him to see how well I can do it.\"    \"That is all very well, Beatrice, but you must have a strong capable  woman to help you,\" said Mrs. Raymond decidedly. \"William Raymond is a  fastidious man, and there must be an experienced cook in the kitchen.\"    \"How much you know about him,\" murmured Bee half enviously. \"Tell me  everything you can, auntie.\"    \"Come into the house then. We will have lunch, and devote the whole  afternoon to William. We could have no more delightful subject,\"  declared the lady, willing for once to indulge Bee's insatiable desire  to hear all she could about her father. \"I am quite sure that it will be  but a repetition of what I have already told you many times, but you  will listen with new interest today.\"          Chapter IV    A Jest Becomes Earnest        \"To mourn a mischief that is past and gone,      Is the next way to draw new mischief on.\"        --_Othello. Shakespeare._      \"Dear, dear! will evening never come!\" exclaimed Beatrice, pushing back  her hair impatiently and looking at the clock in the hall for the third  time in five minutes.    \"Don't you know that the days are longer in June, Bee?\" asked Adele in  mock surprise.    \"Isn't there anything that you can do, Beatrice?\" Mrs. Raymond glanced  up from her embroidery. \"Occupation of some sort is the best remedy for  restlessness.\"    \"Everything is done, auntie. I've even set the table for dinner, and  it's only five o'clock. Three long hours before he comes! What shall I  do?\"    \"It will take nearly all that time to dress,\" remarked Adele rising.    \"How do you manage it, Adele? I need only fifteen minutes.\"    \"Which explains your usual fly-away look,\" observed her aunt quietly.  \"It would do no harm to expend more pains upon your toilet, Beatrice. A  girl cannot be too careful of her personal appearance. This evening of  all others you should desire to look your best.\"    \"I do, auntie; so I will begin to get ready right now,\" replied Bee,  following her cousin out of the room.    It was the Fifteenth of June, and everything was in readiness for Doctor  Raymond's homecoming. He had always objected to a tenant in his home, so  the dwelling had been left in charge of caretakers. Each year, however,  Walnut Grove, as the old vine-clad house was called, had enjoyed a  thorough house-cleaning under Mrs. Raymond's supervision; but never  before had it undergone such a furious renovation. Paint and floors were  scoured; walls swept; beds shaken and sunned, and furniture polished.  The grounds, too, had received attention as the neat appearance of lawn  and garden could testify. The last day of waiting left nothing to do to  beguile the dragging hours.    Mrs. Raymond settled herself for a quiet time after the departure of the  girls, but she was not long left alone. Her calm was shortly broken by  the reappearance of her niece.    \"I've been just as long as ever I could be,\" cried Bee, skimming lightly  across the room to the lady's side. \"I've brushed my hair until the  roots are visible, and if there is a button unfastened anywhere about me  it would take a search warrant to find it. Will I do, auntie?\"    Her aunt suppressed a smile, and looked at her critically. The girl was  looking unusually well. She wore a gown of shimmering white which clung  to her lithesome figure in soft folds. A single red rose nestled  caressingly in her hair and supplied the touch of color needful.  Excitement lent a flush to her cheek and an added lustre to her eye so  that she appeared animated and even brilliant.    \"You never looked so well in your life, Bee,\" approved Mrs. Raymond.  \"Why, you are almost beautiful.\"    \"As if I could ever be that,\" laughed Bee, giving her a bearish hug and  a resounding kiss. \"Although, if anything in the world could transform  me into a beauty it would be father's coming. There, Aunt Annie! I am  going to leave you in peace. I am going into the garden and walk to the  Arbor Vitae hedge. It will take five minutes to walk there, and five to  come back. If I do that six times one hour will be gone.\"    \"Oh, youth! Impatient, restless youth!\" ejaculated the lady as the girl  danced out of the room.    The sun sank to rest. The gorgeous hued clouds of sunset lost their  brilliancy under the approach of gray Twilight, and were folded upon the  breast of Evening. Low in the west hung the silvery crescent of the  young moon; and near, vieing with it in brightness, shone the soft  radiance of the evening star--first wanderer in the train of night. The  twilight shadows lengthened. The odorous breeze, scented with honeyed  clover and the perfume of roses, grew languid in its sweetness, and  presently died away. Great dusky moths drifted silently about the  half-closed flowers, and from the hedge sounded the plaintive notes of a  whip-poor-will.    \"You will not have much longer to wait, Bee,\" comforted Mrs. Raymond,  coming out on the verandah where the girl had taken her stand. \"I heard  the train quite a while ago, so they will soon be here. They are later  than Henry thought they would be. You are not nervous, are you?\"    \"No; that is, I don't know,\" answered Bee, her head bent in a listening  attitude. \"Oh, auntie! What makes the minutes seem so long when one is  waiting for something good to happen? They go fast enough at other  times.\"    \"It is one of those things that can't be explained, child,\" answered  Mrs. Raymond gravely. \"You remember the old proverb: 'A watched pot  never boils'? But it won't be much longer. Try to possess your soul in  patience for just a short time. He will soon be here now. It grows dark,  doesn't it? The dinner will be quite late. Had we not better go inside?\"    \"You may, auntie, but I want to stay right here so as to get the first  glimpse of him.\"    \"I think I will, Bee. The air seems damp, and I am beginning to feel  some of your nervousness. Adele is singing in the parlor. I think I'll  join her.\"    \"Do,\" said Bee briefly.    The darkness grew denser, but Bee still lingered on the porch, her form  half hidden by the vines. Presently the sound of wheels was heard down  the drive, and she started forward eagerly, then paused overcome by a  sudden shyness. Mrs. Raymond hastened to the door, and stepped to the  girl's side.    \"Come,\" she called as Beatrice shrank behind her.    A carriage came rapidly out of the darkness, and drew up before the  entrance. Before it had fairly stopped the door opened, and a man sprang  from it. Quickly he ran up the steps just as Adele appeared in the  doorway, the broad white light of the hall lamp shining about her yellow  hair like a halo, making her face with its beautiful eyes look like a  cameo in a golden setting.    \"Welcome home, William,\" began Mrs. Raymond, but her brother-in-law  brushed by her with eyes only for the graceful figure beyond.    \"My daughter! My dear little daughter!\" he cried, clasping the  astonished girl in his arms.    \"How beautiful you are! You are just as I pictured you.\"    \"Oh!\" burst from Bee in such heartbroken accents that Mrs. Raymond was  galvanized into action.    \"William,\" she cried, laughing nervously, \"you have made a mistake. That  is my daughter, Adele. Beatrice, come and welcome your father.\"    Beatrice came forward slowly. All the joy and sparkle had gone out of  her face, and in its misery it looked dull and heavy.    \"Why, why,\" stammered Doctor Raymond, glancing from one girl to the  other, his disappointment written plainly upon his countenance. \"I  thought, I certainly thought--\"    \"You thought that I was Bee, didn't you?\" smiled Adele, gracefully  disengaging herself from his embrace. \"It was a funny mistake, as we are  not a bit alike. Bee is so clever.\"    \"Yes; I dare say.\" The entomologist was clearly bewildered by the  occurrence, and he greeted his own daughter awkwardly in consequence.  Bee received his caress passively, feeling with unerring intuition his  lack of warmth.    Mechanically she followed the others into the parlor, her anguish each  moment becoming more intolerable. She could not but remark how her  father's eyes were constantly straying toward Adele who was fairly  radiant. Bee had adored her cousin, and had been proud of her beauty;  but now, something closely resembling hatred crept into her heart.    Hoping that the cheer and conversation of the table would put matters  upon a more genial footing, Mrs. Raymond ushered them in to dinner. The  lady, as well as her husband, had been distressed by the incident, and  both viewed with anxiety Beatrice's constraint and coldness. The girl  was usually the gayest of the gay at table, and so light-hearted that  her aunt frequently reproved her for her levity, but now, fearful of  losing control of herself, she grew so frigid that there was no thawing  her out. The talk was chiefly among the grown people.    \"What are your plans, William?\" asked Henry Raymond.    \"They are uncertain,\" replied Doctor Raymond. \"I shall be here for the  summer at least. I have a great number of specimens to mount and to  catalogue, beside some work upon my new book. In fact, I have so much  on hand that I fear it will be very lonesome for Beatrice. Do you not  think, my child,--\" with a conciliatory smile in Bee's direction, and  blundering into a second error as even the most learned of men, be they  lepidopterists or what not, sometimes will,--\"do you not think that you  would better have your cousin with you for the summer?\"    \"No;\" blurted out Bee, unable to trust herself to utter more than the  single word.    \"Why, bless my soul!\" ejaculated the scientist,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#5)"],[1,"ched, (like the silk on the framework of an umbrella,) a very  thin elastic skin, or membrane,[4] which is continued from the tips of  the little fingers to the ankles of the hind-legs, and then very nearly  to the end of the tail, which is almost as long as his body. So that  the animal, when spread out in the flying position, is entirely  surrounded with the membrane, except at the head and neck. The toes of  the hind-foot, and the thumb of the hand, are not attached to the skin,  and are not longer than those of other animals. These are furnished  with sharp and hooked claws, so that the bat can cling very firmly to  walls and perpendicular rocks.          [4] The membrane of the bat's wing appears to possess a most        exquisite and inconceivable sensibility. Cruel experiments have        proved that this animal, when deprived of the senses of seeing,        hearing, and smelling, will still fly about a room, without ever        coming into contact with the walls, or with threads stretched        across in all directions. Cuvier supposes, that \"the propinquity        of solid bodies is perceived by the manner in which the air        re-acts upon the surface of the wings.\" This astonishing faculty,        which almost indicates the possession of a sixth sense unknown to        us, is no doubt of great use to the bat, as it enables him to        pursue his rapid zigzag flight in the dark, without fear of        striking against the boughs of trees, or other obstacles.          The animal introduced in the tale is the common bat, _Vespertilio        pipistrellus_ of modern naturalists. It is now ascertained that        no less than seventeen species of this singular family are        natives of this country. Some of them are very much larger than        the common bat, measuring fifteen inches in the extent of their        wings.    It has been said, that the bat is nothing more than a _mouse with  wings_. Nonsense! except in its size, it has no more resemblance to the  _mouse_, than it has to the _lion_; and those who think that the two  animals are at all alike can never have examined them attentively.  However, in some parts of the country the bat is still called by its  old English name, \"_the flittermouse_,\" that is, the mouse that  _flitters_, or _flutters_ about.    When Leatherwing had caught most of the insects at the upper end of the  pond, he thought he would try what success he could meet with lower  down; and then he came so near the oak-tree that Brush managed to make  him hear at last. So the bat, who happened to be in rather a talkative  mood, left off insect-hunting for the present, for the sake of enjoying  a little gossip with his old acquaintance. He settled on a branch close  by, but instead of sitting down like other animals, the queer little  creature chose to hang himself up by his hind-claws, with his head  downwards, and his wings closely folded round him. In this strange,  and, as most people would think, extremely uncomfortable position, old  Leatherwing began the following conversation:--    LEATHERWING.    Well, Master Brush, what do you want with me now? Just made such a  glorious supper! Do you know, I fancy that the insects about this pond  of yours are fatter and better tasted than any others, and that's the  reason I come so far after them. For _'tis_ a good way off, you know,  to the old church-tower where I live. Well, but as I was saying, what  do you want with me this evening?    BRUSH.    Why, I want to ask you a question, for to tell you the truth, yesterday  evening Mrs. B. and I had a little----    LEATHERWING.    What! a little addition to your family? you don't say so! Well, I  thought it was almost time, for we are nearly in the middle of summer.  Now do you know Mrs. Leatherwing was confined several days ago, and  that's the reason she is not with me this evening. I left her flying up  and down a shady lane nearer home, carrying her baby about with her, as  she always does, you know, till it grows pretty strong. She had only  one this time. And so Mrs. Brush is confined, is she? Well, I  congratulate you. How many has she got? Five or six, I'll be bound!    BRUSH.    She hasn't got any at all yet, Mr. Leatherwing, though what may happen  in the course of a few days I cannot possibly tell. But I want to ask  you a question about something that has puzzled us very much lately.    LEATHERWING.    To be sure, I dare say I shall be able to answer it; for though I say  it myself, I _am_ able to give you an answer to almost any question.  For you see, friend Brush, I have lived all my life in towns and  villages, and so I have heard and seen a good deal of what passes in  the world. Then I am not like you sleepy animals, who hardly ever wake  up more than once or twice during the whole winter. To be sure, I take  a little nap myself, of about a couple of months, in the very coldest  weather, when there are no insects stirring. We bats, you know, can't  eat nuts, and such sort of trash; and so when there is no wholesome  food to be met with, we are obliged to sleep a little, just to pass  away the time. Now, if I could contrive to keep a winter stock of  _gnats_, as easily as you can of _nuts_, I declare I would not sleep  much more in winter than in summer. For I don't mind a little frost,  not I! only in cold weather, instead of flying about in the evening, as  I do at this time of the year, I choose the sunshine in the middle of  the day, because then I have the best chance of meeting with some game.  And yet ignorant people say that I cannot bear the light of the sun! I  can tell you, that I picked up a pretty good meal of insects one bright  day last winter, when the ground was frozen hard, and I heard some of  the stupid boys in our village call out, as I passed them, 'Why!  there's a bat! Throw thy cap at him, Jem! What business has _he_ got to  be flying about now, I wonder?' And then another said, 'Throw at him!  Well done! Once get him down on the ground, and he can neither run nor  fly. These fellows can't raise themselves off the ground, dost know!'    \"Great fools! I might easily have shown them that I can both run very  well on the ground, and fly up from it when I choose; but I did _not_  choose to try it just then. But let me see, what were we talking about?  You were going to ask me a question, I think.\"    As Brush had now an opportunity of speaking at last, he related to  Leatherwing all the tales he had heard about the evil doings of the  water-rats, and also what he had himself observed of their habits. Then  he asked the bat for his opinion upon this puzzling question, and the  old fellow gave it as follows:--    LEATHERWING.    The longer I live in the world, my good friend Brush, and the more I  see of the world, the more I am astonished at the stupidity and amazing  ignorance of the people I meet with! To be sure, everybody has not had  such good opportunities as myself of obtaining information, or has not  made such good use of them. But let that pass. Now for these water-rats.  In the first place, then, they _are_ a very quiet, inoffensive people,  and would no more think of killing a mouse, or a young bird, or any  other small animal, than you would. The only mischief they ever do is  by boring their holes through the embankments of canals and ponds, and  in this manner the meadows have sometimes been flooded. In the second  place, all the other wicked deeds that they have been accused of should  be laid to the charge of the _common brown rat_, a ferocious,  savage-tempered creature, which often lives in the banks of ditches,  and is then supposed by silly people to be the same animal as the  water-rat.    BRUSH.    Capital! so I was right after all about the character of these  good-tempered neighbours of ours. Ho, ho! Mrs. Brush, I shall have  something to tell you presently! Then it must have been one of these  common brown rascal that killed little Gotobed's relation.    LEATHERWING.    To be sure it was, for as I tell you, they are fierce, savage  creatures, and are so voracious that they will eat anything. They  destroy young birds and other animals; and if no other food could be  found, I dare say they would be wicked and unnatural enough to make a  meal of their own young ones. And yet, let me tell you, they are very  clever, sensible creatures, if they would but make a better use of  their abilities. The worst of it all is that they are _foreigners_, and  have no business in this country at all, though from what part of the  world they came I cannot tell you.[5] And if I cannot answer this  question, you may be sure, friend Brush, that there are not many people  living who can. However, here the rascals are; and what do you think  they have been endeavouring to do ever since they came? Why, they have  been trying to destroy all the rats that had possession of the country  before their arrival; and as these old English black rats, as they are  called from their colour, are smaller and weaker than themselves, I  dare say that they will at last succeed in their wicked designs. So as  this vile foreign brown rat is fond of living in the banks of ditches  and of ponds, near mills and stables, he is often thought to be the  same as the quiet respectable water-rat. For, as I say, the stupidity  and ignorance of people is really amazing! Why, the two animals are no  more alike than you and I are, I was going to say; certainly not nearly  so much alike, except in size, as yourself and the little Gotobeds down  below, there. No! these water friends of yours should never acknowledge  the common rat as a cousin; but they are not very distantly related to  a much more noble animal--to the _beaver_,[6] friend Brush, though  perhaps you have never heard of such a creature.          [5] The common brown rat, which has now been an inhabitant of        this island for about one hundred years, is often improperly        called the \"Norway rat,\" as"]]]
