Any camp that falls short of this, lacks the requirements of  warmth, brightness and healthfulness. This is why I discard all close,  canvas tents.    [Sidenote: _The Indian Camp_]    [Illustration: INDIAN CAMP]    The simplest and most primitive of all camps is the \"Indian camp.\" It  is easily and quickly made, is warm and comfortable, and stands a pretty  heavy rain when properly put up. This is how it is made: Let us say you  are out and have slightly missed your way. The coming gloom warns you  that night is shutting down. You are no tenderfoot. You know that a  place of rest is essential to health and comfort through the long, cold  November night. You dive down the first little hollow until you strike a  rill of water, for water is a prime necessity. As you draw your hatchet  you take in the whole situation at a glance. The little stream is  gurgling downward in a half choked frozen way. There is a huge sodden  hemlock lying across it. One clip of the hatchet shows it will peel.  There is plenty of smaller timber standing around; long, slim poles,  with a tuft of foliage on top. Five minutes suffice to drop one of  these, cut a twelve-foot pole from it, sharpen the pole at each end, jam  one end into the ground and the other into the rough back of a scraggy  hemlock, and there is your ridge pole. Now go--with your hatchet--for  the bushiest and most promising young hemlocks within reach. Drop them  and draw them to camp rapidly. Next, you need a fire. There are fifty  hard, resinous limbs sticking up from the prone hemlock; lop off a few  of these, and split the largest into match timber; reduce the splinters  to shavings, scrape the wet leaves from your prospective fireplace, and  strike a match on the balloon part of your trousers. If you are a  woodsman you will strike but one. Feed the fire slowly at first; it will  gain fast. When you have a blaze ten feet high, look at your watch. It  is 6 P.M. You don't want to turn in before 10 o'clock, and you have four  hours to kill before bed-time. Now, tackle the old hemlock; take off  every dry limb, and then peel the bark and bring it to camp. You will  find this takes an hour or more.    Next, strip every limb from your young hemlocks, and shingle them onto  your ridge pole. This will make a sort of bear den, very well calculated  to give you a comfortable night's rest. The bright fire will soon dry  the ground that is to be your bed, and you will have plenty of time to  drop another small hemlock and make a bed of browse a foot thick. You do  it. Then you make your pillow. Now, this pillow is essential to comfort  and very simple. It is half a yard of muslin, sewed up as a bag, and  filled with moss or hemlock browse. You can empty it and put it in your  pocket, where it takes up about as much room as a handkerchief. You have  other little muslin bags--an' you be wise. One holds a couple of ounces  of good tea; another, sugar; another is kept to put your loose duffle  in: money, match safe, pocket-knife. You have a pat of butter and a bit  of pork, with a liberal slice of brown bread; and before turning in you  make a cup of tea, broil a slice of pork, and indulge in a lunch.    Ten o'clock comes. The time has not passed tediously. You are warm, dry  and well-fed. Your old friends, the owls, come near the fire-light and  salute you with their strange wild notes; a distant fox sets up for  himself with his odd, barking cry and you turn in. Not ready to sleep  just yet.    But you drop off; and it is two bells in the morning watch when you  waken with a sense of chill and darkness. The fire has burned low, and  snow is falling. The owls have left, and a deep silence broods over the  cold, still forest. You rouse the fire, and, as the bright light shines  to the furthest recesses of your forest den, get out the little pipe,  and reduce a bit of navy plug to its lowest denomination. The smoke  curls lazily upward; the fire makes you warm and drowsy, and again you  lie down--to again awaken with a sense of chilliness--to find the fire  burned low, and daylight breaking. You have slept better than you would  in your own room at home. You have slept in an \"Indian camp.\"    You have also learned the difference between such a simple shelter and  an open air bivouac under a tree or beside an old log.    Another easily made and very comfortable camp is the \"brush shanty,\" as  it is usually called in Northern Pennsylvania. The frame for such a  shanty is a cross-pole resting on two crotches about six feet high, and  enough straight poles to make a foundation for the thatch. The poles are  laid about six inches apart, one end of the ground, the other on the  cross-pole, and at a pretty sharp angle. The thatch is made of the  fan-like boughs cut from the thrifty young hemlock, and are to be laid  bottom upward and feather end down. Commence to lay them from the  ground, and work up to the cross-pole, shingling them carefully as you  go. If the thatch be laid a foot in thickness, and well done, the shanty  will stand a pretty heavy rain--better than the average bark roof, which  is only rain-proof in dry weather.    A bark camp, however, may be a very neat sylvan affair, provided you are  camping where spruce or balsam fir may be easily reached, and in the hot  months when bark will \"peel\"; and you have a day in which to work at a  camp. The best bark camps I have ever seen are in the Adirondacks. Some  of them are rather elaborate in construction, requiring two or more  days' hard labor by a couple of guides. When the stay is to be a long  one, and the camp permanent, perhaps it will pay.    [Sidenote: _The Shanty-Tent_]    As good a camp as I have ever tried--perhaps the best--is the  \"shanty-tent,\" shown in the illustration. It is easily put up, is  comfortable, neat, and absolutely rain-proof. Of course, it may be of  any required size; but, for a party of two, the following dimensions and  directions will be found all sufficient:    Firstly, the roof. This is merely a sheet of strong cotton cloth 9 feet  long by 4 or 4-1/2 feet in width. The sides, of the same material, to be  4-1/2 feet deep at front, and 2 feet deep at the back. This gives 7 feet  along the edge of the roof, leaving 2 feet for turning down at the back  end of the shanty. It will be seen that the sides must be \"cut bias,\" to  compensate for the angle of the roof, otherwise the shanty will not be  square and shipshape when put up. Allowing for waste in cutting, it  takes nearly 3 yards of cloth for each side. The only labor required in  making, is to cut the sides to the proper shape, and stitch them to the  roof. No buttons, strings, or loops. The cloth does not even require  hemming. It does, however, need a little water-proofing; for which the  following receipt will answer very well, and add little or nothing to  the weight: To 10 quarts of water add 10 ounces of lime, and 4 ounces of  alum; let it stand until clear; fold the cloth snugly and put it in  another vessel, pour the solution on it, let it soak for 12 hours; then  rinse in luke-warm rain water, stretch and dry in the sun, and the  shanty-tent is ready for use.    [Sidenote: _Construction_]    To put it up properly, make a neat frame as follows: Two strong stakes  or posts for the front, driven firmly in the ground 4-1/2 feet apart; at  a distance of 6 feet 10 inches from these, drive two other posts--these  to be 4 feet apart--for back end of shanty. The front posts to be 4-1/2  feet high, the back rests only two feet. The former also to incline a  little toward each other above, so as to measure from outside of posts,  just 4 feet at top. This gives a little more width at front end of  shanty, adding space and warmth. No crotches are used in putting up the  shanty-tent. Each of the four posts is fitted on the top to receive a  flat-ended cross-pole, and admit of nailing. When the posts are squarely  ranged and driven, select two straight, hard-wood rods, 2 inches in  diameter, and 7 feet in length--or a little more. Flatten the ends  carefully and truly, lay them alongside on top from post to post, and  fasten them with a light nail at each end. Now, select two more straight  rods of the same size, but a little over 4 feet in length; flatten the  ends of these as you did the others, lay them crosswise from side to  side, and lapping the ends of the other rods; fasten them solidly by  driving a six-penny nail through the ends and into the posts, and you  have a square frame 7x4 feet. But it is not yet complete. Three light  rods are needed for rafters. These are to be placed lengthwise of the  roof at equal distances apart, and nailed or tied to keep them in place.  Then take two straight poles a little over 7 feet long, and some 3  inches in diameter. These are to be accurately flattened at the ends,  and nailed to the bottom of the posts, snug to the ground, on outside  of posts. A foot-log and head-log are indispensable. These should be  about 5 inches in diameter, and of a length to just reach from outside  to outside of posts. They should be squared at ends, and the foot-log  placed against the front post, outside, and held firmly in place by two  wooden pins. The head-log is fastened the same way, except that it goes  against the inside of the back posts; and the frame is complete. Round  off all sharp angles or corners with knife and hatchet, and proceed to  spread and fasten the cloth. Lay the roof on evenly, and tack it truly  to the front cross-rod, using about a dozen six-ounce tacks. Stretch the  cloth to its bearings, and tack it at the back end in the same manner.  Stretch it sidewise and tack the sides to the side poles, fore and aft.  Tack front and back ends of sides to the front and back posts. Bring  down the 2-foot flap of roof at back end of shanty; stretch, and tack it  snugly to the back posts--and your sylvan house is done. It is  rain-proof, wind-proof, warm and comfortable.

Does he fear that to-day of all days the ghosts of the  past will come forth to meet him from every corner of the well-lighted  room?    If that be the case, it is foolish to fly from them, Moses Freudenthal!  See, they dog your footsteps wherever you go through the narrow gloomy  little streets. They whisper in your ear, even though you strive to  drown their voices by entering into conversation with the passers-by.  They appear before your very eyes in spite of your fixing them upon the  votive tablets fastened to the pillars in the house of God! And when  you pass through the congregation and take your seat in your accustomed  place, they flutter around your head, look at you out of the very  letters of your prayer-book, and speak to you in the voice of the  officiating minister!...    \"Praise ye the Lord. Break out into joy, gladness, and song. For He  judgeth the world with righteousness and the people with His truth.\"    \"And the solitary,\" cries a secret voice in the heart of the unhappy  man, \"shall He break in pieces!\" His eyes are fixed upon his book, his  lips whisper the words of prayer; but he does not pray, he can not! The  whole of his past life rises ghost-like before his mental vision, and in  such vivid detail as to cause him intense agony....    \"He who can no longer pray,\" his old father had often told him, and now  the words involuntarily recur to him,--\"He who can no longer pray shall  be cast out from before the face of the Eternal.\" He distinctly  remembers the day on which he had first heard those words. He was then a  boy of thirteen, and had been allowed to put on the phylacteries for the  first time, the sign that he had reached man's estate. The life that  opened out before him on that day was not easy and pleasant like that of  the fortunate of the earth, but hard and narrow as that endured by his  race. In common with every one around him, he had early learned to  dedicate his life to two objects, and these were--prayer and  money-making. When he was seventeen years of age his father had called  him into his room, and had then told him, in a calm matter-of-fact tone,  that he was to marry Chaim Gruenstein's daughter Rosele in three months'  time. He did not know the girl. He had seen her, it is true, but he had  never really looked at her. His father had, however, chosen her to be  his wife, and he was satisfied that it was well. Three months later he  married Rosele....    Hark! the Chazzan is beginning the ancient Sabbath hymn, whose words,  expressive of joy and longing, go straight to the heart--\"Lecho daudi  likras kalle.\" And immediately the choir takes up the strain  triumphantly, \"Lecho daudi likras kalle\"--\"Come, O friend, let us go  forth to meet the Bride, let us receive the Sabbath with joy!\"    Strange emotion to stir the spirit of a people to its very depths!  Strange that all the passion and sensuousness of which its heart and  mind are capable are expended on the adoration of the Divinity, and on  that alone. The same race whose genius gave birth to the Song of  Songs--the eternal hymn of love,--and to whom the world owes the story  of Ruth, the most beautiful idyl of womanhood ever known--has now, after  a thousand years of the night of oppression and wandering, learned to  look upon marriage as a mere matter of business, by which to secure some  pecuniary advantage, and as a means of preventing the chosen of the  Lord from dying off the face of the earth. These men know not what they  do--they have no suspicion of the sin of which they are guilty in thus  acting.    Nor did Moses Freudenthal know it. He honored his wife as long as she  lived, and found in her a faithful helpmeet in joy and sorrow. A  blessing seemed to rest upon everything he did, for whatever he  undertook prospered. He studied the language of the Christians around  him with an eager determination to learn, and then began the arduous  task of learning German law: the man of thirty studied as hard as if he  had been a schoolboy. He was not actuated by the desire of gain alone,  but also by a love of honor and knowledge. And this knowledge bore  fruit; he became rich--very rich. The nobles and officers of the  neighborhood came to his house and bowed themselves down before the  majesty of his wealth; but before he had done with them, they were  forced to hold him in as much respect as his gold. In those days every  one envied him, and people used to whisper as he passed--\"That is the  happiest man in the whole district.\"    But was he really happy? If he were so, why did he often look gloomy,  and why did Rosele weep as if her heart would break, when she was sure  that no one could see her? A dark shadow rested on the married life of  this couple, who, in their daily intercourse, had gradually learned to  esteem each other. Their marriage was childless. As they had been  brought together by strangers, and were not even yet united in heart and  soul, they could not live down their sorrow, or find comfort in each  other's love. The proud man bore his grief in silence, and, unmoved,  watched his wife fading away before his very eyes. When his friends  spoke of a divorce, he shook his head, but no word of love for the  unhappy woman to whom he was bound ever crossed his lips. Years passed  away; but at last one evening--it was in winter--when he entered the  sitting-room, and wished his wife \"good evening\" as usual, instead of  answering softly, and glancing at him shyly and sadly, she hastened to  meet him, and clung to him as though she felt for the first time that  she had a right to his love. He gazed at her blushing excited face, his  surprise giving way to joyful anticipation; then taking her hand, he  drew her down to the seat beside him, and made her lay her head upon his  breast. Their lips trembled, but neither of them could find words to  express their joy--none seemed adequate!...    \"Praise ye the Lord!\" These words of the minister roused Moses from his  dream of the past, and he hears the congregation reply, \"Praised be the  Lord our God, who createth the day and createth the night, who  separateth the light from the darkness, and the darkness from the light:  praised be the Lord, the Almighty, the Eternal, the God of battles!...\"    \"Praised be God!...\" With what mixed feelings had Moses Freudenthal  joined in this cry of thanksgiving on that Sabbath evening twenty-two  years ago when he first entered the house of God a father! His heart  bled and rejoiced at the same moment; he wept with mingled joy and  sorrow, for a little daughter had indeed been born to him: but his  wife's strength had been unable to withstand her sufferings, and she had  died. She had borne her terrible agony with unmurmuring resignation; and  even when dying a happy smile passed over her pale face whenever she  heard the voice of her child. In those sad hours before the end the  hearts of the husband and wife, that had remained strangers to each  other during the long years of their married life, at length found each  other out. He alone understood why his wife said, \"Now I can die in  peace;\" she alone understood why he bent over her hand again and again,  sobbing, \"Forgive me, Rosele; forgive me!\" \"The child,\" she said; \"take  care of the child!\" then she shivered and died. Next morning they  carried her out to the \"good place.\" And he rent his garments, took the  shoes from off his feet, and sat on the floor of the chamber of death  for seven days and seven nights, thus fulfilling the days of mourning  after the manner of the children of Israel. He did not weep, but fixed  his sad tearless eyes on the flame of the funeral light which has to  burn for a whole week in order that the homeless spirit may have a  resting-place on earth until God shows it where it is henceforth to  dwell.    \"He is talking to the dead,\" whispered his relations in awe-struck  tones, when they saw his lips move, as he murmured, \"All might have been  well now, and you are dead!\"      His sorrow found relief in tears when they brought him the child, and  asked what it should be called. \"Esther,\" he answered--\"Esther, like my  mother.\" He held his little daughter long in his arms, and his tears  fell on her face. Then he gave the child back to her nurse, and from  that moment became calm and composed.    When the days of mourning were over he returned to his business, and  worked harder than ever before. A new spirit seemed to possess him, and  every day he embarked in new and daring undertakings. He ventured to do  what no one else would attempt, and fortune remained true to him. He now  carried out the wish he had long nourished--bought the piece of land  opposite the Dominican monastery, and began to build a large house  there. He passed his days in unceasing labor; but in the evening he  would sit for hours at a time by his child's cradle, gazing at the soft  baby face. And in the first months after his bereavement, the nurse was  often startled by seeing him come noiselessly into the nursery in the  middle of the night, and watch and listen long to see if all were well  with the child.    The days grew into months, the months into years, and little Esterka  became ever more remarkable for beauty and cleverness as time went on.  She was very like her father, for she had the same black curly hair,  high forehead, and determined mouth; but in strange and touching  contrast with the other features of the defiant little face, were the  gentle blue eyes she had inherited from her mother. The father often  looked at those eyes, and whenever he did so, he took his little girl in  his arms, pressed her to his heart, and called her by a thousand pet  names; but except at such times, the grave reserved man showed the child  few tokens of the almost insane love he bore her.    When Esther was five years old they left the small house they had  formerly inhabited in the Ghetto, and went to live "]]]
