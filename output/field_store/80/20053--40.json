Since the Refractions on both  sides the Prism are equal to one another, that is, the Refraction at K  equal to the Refraction at J, and the Refraction at L equal to the  Refraction at H, so that the Refractions of the incident Rays at K and L  taken together, are equal to the Refractions of the emergent Rays at H  and J taken together: it follows by adding equal things to equal things,  that the Refractions at K and H taken together, are equal to the  Refractions at J and L taken together, and therefore the two Rays being  equally refracted, have the same Inclination to one another after  Refraction which they had before; that is, the Inclination of half a  Degree answering to the Sun's Diameter. For so great was the inclination  of the Rays to one another before Refraction. So then, the length of the  Image PT would by the Rules of Vulgar Opticks subtend an Angle of half a  Degree at the Prism, and by Consequence be equal to the breadth _vw_;  and therefore the Image would be round. Thus it would be were the two  Rays XLJT and YKHP, and all the rest which form the Image P_w_T_v_,  alike refrangible. And therefore seeing by Experience it is found that  the Image is not round, but about five times longer than broad, the Rays  which going to the upper end P of the Image suffer the greatest  Refraction, must be more refrangible than those which go to the lower  end T, unless the Inequality of Refraction be casual.    This Image or Spectrum PT was coloured, being red at its least refracted  end T, and violet at its most refracted end P, and yellow green and  blue in the intermediate Spaces. Which agrees with the first  Proposition, that Lights which differ in Colour, do also differ in  Refrangibility. The length of the Image in the foregoing Experiments, I  measured from the faintest and outmost red at one end, to the faintest  and outmost blue at the other end, excepting only a little Penumbra,  whose breadth scarce exceeded a quarter of an Inch, as was said above.    _Exper._ 4. In the Sun's Beam which was propagated into the Room through  the hole in the Window-shut, at the distance of some Feet from the hole,  I held the Prism in such a Posture, that its Axis might be perpendicular  to that Beam. Then I looked through the Prism upon the hole, and turning  the Prism to and fro about its Axis, to make the Image of the Hole  ascend and descend, when between its two contrary Motions it seemed  Stationary, I stopp'd the Prism, that the Refractions of both sides of  the refracting Angle might be equal to each other, as in the former  Experiment. In this situation of the Prism viewing through it the said  Hole, I observed the length of its refracted Image to be many times  greater than its breadth, and that the most refracted part thereof  appeared violet, the least refracted red, the middle parts blue, green  and yellow in order. The same thing happen'd when I removed the Prism  out of the Sun's Light, and looked through it upon the hole shining by  the Light of the Clouds beyond it. And yet if the Refraction were done  regularly according to one certain Proportion of the Sines of Incidence  and Refraction as is vulgarly supposed, the refracted Image ought to  have appeared round.    So then, by these two Experiments it appears, that in Equal Incidences  there is a considerable inequality of Refractions. But whence this  inequality arises, whether it be that some of the incident Rays are  refracted more, and others less, constantly, or by chance, or that one  and the same Ray is by Refraction disturbed, shatter'd, dilated, and as  it were split and spread into many diverging Rays, as _Grimaldo_  supposes, does not yet appear by these Experiments, but will appear by  those that follow.    _Exper._ 5. Considering therefore, that if in the third Experiment the  Image of the Sun should be drawn out into an oblong Form, either by a  Dilatation of every Ray, or by any other casual inequality of the  Refractions, the same oblong Image would by a second Refraction made  sideways be drawn out as much in breadth by the like Dilatation of the  Rays, or other casual inequality of the Refractions sideways, I tried  what would be the Effects of such a second Refraction. For this end I  ordered all things as in the third Experiment, and then placed a second  Prism immediately after the first in a cross Position to it, that it  might again refract the beam of the Sun's Light which came to it through  the first Prism. In the first Prism this beam was refracted upwards, and  in the second sideways. And I found that by the Refraction of the second  Prism, the breadth of the Image was not increased, but its superior  part, which in the first Prism suffered the greater Refraction, and  appeared violet and blue, did again in the second Prism suffer a greater  Refraction than its inferior part, which appeared red and yellow, and  this without any Dilatation of the Image in breadth.    [Illustration: FIG. 14]    _Illustration._ Let S [_Fig._ 14, 15.] represent the Sun, F the hole in  the Window, ABC the first Prism, DH the second Prism, Y the round Image  of the Sun made by a direct beam of Light when the Prisms are taken  away, PT the oblong Image of the Sun made by that beam passing through  the first Prism alone, when the second Prism is taken away, and _pt_ the  Image made by the cross Refractions of both Prisms together. Now if the  Rays which tend towards the several Points of the round Image Y were  dilated and spread by the Refraction of the first Prism, so that they  should not any longer go in single Lines to single Points, but that  every Ray being split, shattered, and changed from a Linear Ray to a  Superficies of Rays diverging from the Point of Refraction, and lying in  the Plane of the Angles of Incidence and Refraction, they should go in  those Planes to so many Lines reaching almost from one end of the Image  PT to the other, and if that Image should thence become oblong: those  Rays and their several parts tending towards the several Points of the  Image PT ought to be again dilated and spread sideways by the transverse  Refraction of the second Prism, so as to compose a four square Image,  such as is represented at [Greek: pt]. For the better understanding of  which, let the Image PT be distinguished into five equal parts PQK,  KQRL, LRSM, MSVN, NVT. And by the same irregularity that the orbicular  Light Y is by the Refraction of the first Prism dilated and drawn out  into a long Image PT, the Light PQK which takes up a space of the same  length and breadth with the Light Y ought to be by the Refraction of the  second Prism dilated and drawn out into the long Image _[Greek: p]qkp_,  and the Light KQRL into the long Image _kqrl_, and the Lights LRSM,  MSVN, NVT, into so many other long Images _lrsm_, _msvn_, _nvt[Greek:  t]_; and all these long Images would compose the four square Images  _[Greek: pt]_. Thus it ought to be were every Ray dilated by Refraction,  and spread into a triangular Superficies of Rays diverging from the  Point of Refraction. For the second Refraction would spread the Rays one  way as much as the first doth another, and so dilate the Image in  breadth as much as the first doth in length. And the same thing ought to  happen, were some rays casually refracted more than others. But the  Event is otherwise. The Image PT was not made broader by the Refraction  of the second Prism, but only became oblique, as 'tis represented at  _pt_, its upper end P being by the Refraction translated to a greater  distance than its lower end T. So then the Light which went towards the  upper end P of the Image, was (at equal Incidences) more refracted in  the second Prism, than the Light which tended towards the lower end T,  that is the blue and violet, than the red and yellow; and therefore was  more refrangible. The same Light was by the Refraction of the first  Prism translated farther from the place Y to which it tended before  Refraction; and therefore suffered as well in the first Prism as in the  second a greater Refraction than the rest of the Light, and by  consequence was more refrangible than the rest, even before its  incidence on the first Prism.    Sometimes I placed a third Prism after the second, and sometimes also a  fourth after the third, by all which the Image might be often refracted  sideways: but the Rays which were more refracted than the rest in the  first Prism were also more refracted in all the rest, and that without  any Dilatation of the Image sideways: and therefore those Rays for their  constancy of a greater Refraction are deservedly reputed more  refrangible.    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    But that the meaning of this Experiment may more clearly appear, it is  to be considered that the Rays which are equally refrangible do fall  upon a Circle answering to the Sun's Disque. For this was proved in the  third Experiment. By a Circle I understand not here a perfect  geometrical Circle, but any orbicular Figure whose length is equal to  its breadth, and which, as to Sense, may seem circular. Let therefore AG  [in _Fig._ 15.] represent the Circle which all the most refrangible Rays  propagated from the whole Disque of the Sun, would illuminate and paint  upon the opposite Wall if they were alone; EL the Circle which all the  least refrangible Rays would in like manner illuminate and paint if they  were alone; BH, CJ, DK, the Circles which so many intermediate sorts of  Rays would successively paint upon the Wall, if they were singly  propagated from the Sun in successive order, the rest being always  intercepted; and conceive that there are other intermediate Circles  without Number, which innumerable other intermediate sorts of Rays would  successively paint upon the Wall if the Sun should successively emit  every sort apart. And seeing the Sun emits all these sorts at once, they  must all together illuminate and paint innumerable equal"]]]
