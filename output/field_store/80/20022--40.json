Terrestrials couldn't possibly have  any respect for him if they saw him prodding kumquats with his toes.\"    \"It's no sillier than writing with one's vestigial wings!\" Tarb blazed.    \"Well!\" Miss Snow exclaimed in Terran. \"Well, _really_!\"    Tarb started to stick out her tongue, then remembered. \"I didn't mean to  offend you, Miss Snow. I know it's your custom. But wouldn't you  understand if I typewrote with my feet?\"    Miss Snow tittered.    \"If you want the honest truth, hon, it would make you look like a  feathered monkey.\"    \"If you want the honest truth about what you look like to me,  dearie--it's a plucked chicken!\"    \"Tarb, I think you should apologize to Miss Snow!\"    \"All right!\" Tarb stuck out her tongue. Miss Snow promptly thrust out  hers in return.    \"Ladies, ladies!\" Stet cried. \"I think there has been a slight confusion  of folkways!\" He quickly changed the subject. \"Is that another letter  you have there, Tarb?\"    \"Yes, but I didn't try to answer it. I thought you'd better have a look  at it first, since Miss Snow didn't seem to think much of the job I did  with the other one.\"    \"Miss Snow always has the _Times'_ welfare at heart,\" Stet remarked  ambiguously, and read:         _Chicago_         _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_         _I am employed as translator by the extraterrestrial division of       Burns and Deerhart, Inc., the well-known interstellar mail-order       house. As the company employs no other Fizbians and our offices are       situated in a small rural community where no others of our race       reside, I find myself rather lonely. Moreover, being a bachelor,       with neither chick nor child on Fizbus, I have nothing to look       forward to upon my return to the Home Planet some day._         _Accordingly, I decided to adopt a child to cheer my declining       years. I dispatched an interstellargram to a reliable orphanage on       Fizbus, outlining my hopes and requirements in some detail. After       they had satisfied themselves as to my income, strength of       character, etc., they sent me a fatherless and motherless egg in       cold storage, which I was supposed to hatch upon arrival._         _However, when the egg came to Earth, it was impounded by Customs.       They say it is forbidden to import extrasolar eggs. I have tried to       explain to them that it is not at all a question of importation but       of adoption; however, they cannot or will not understand._         _Please tell me what to do. I fear that they may not be keeping the       egg at the correct Fizbian freezing point--which, as you know, is a       good deal lower than Earth's. The fledgling may hatch by itself and       receive a traumatic shock that might very well damage its entire       psyche permanently._         _Frantically yours,_         _Glibmus Gluyt_    \"Oh, for the stars' sake!\" Stet exploded. \"This is really too much! Viz  our consul, Miss Snow. That egg must go back to Fizbus at once, before  any Terrestrials hear of it! And I must notify the government back on  the Home Planet to keep a close check on all egg shipments. Something  like this must certainly not occur again.\"    \"Why shouldn't the Terrestrials hear of it?\" Tarb asked, outraged. \"And  I think it's mean of you to send back a poor little orphan egg like that  when it has a chance of getting a good home.\"    \"An egg!\" Miss Snow repeated incredulously. \"You mean you really...?\"  She gave me one mad little hoot of laughter and then stopped and  strangled slightly. Her face turned purple in her efforts to restrain  mirth. _Really_, Tarb thought, _she looks so much better that color_.    Stet's crest twitched violently. \"I hope--\" he began. \"I do hope you  will keep this ... knowledge to yourself, Miss Snow.\"    \"But of course,\" she assured him, calming down. \"I'm dreadfully sorry I  was so rude. Naturally I wouldn't dream of telling a soul, Mr. Zarnon.  You can trust me.\"    \"I'm sure I can, Miss Snow.\"    Tarb almost choked with indignation. \"You mean you've been keeping the  facts of our life from Terrestrials? As if they were fledglings ... no,  even fledglings are told these days.\"    \"One could hardly blame him for it, Miss Morfatch,\" Miss Snow said. \"You  wouldn't want people to know that Fizbians laid eggs, would you?\"    \"And why not?\"    \"Tarb,\" Stet intervened, \"you don't know what you're talking about.\"    \"Oh, don't I? You're ashamed of the fact that we bear our children in a  clean, decent, honorable way instead of--\" She stopped. \"I'm being as  bad as you two are. Probably the Terrestrials' way of reproduction  doesn't seem dirty to them--but, since they do reproduce _that_ way,  they could scarcely find our way objectionable!\"    \"Tarb, that's not how a young girl should talk!\"    \"Oh, go lay an egg!\" she said, knowing that she had overstepped the  limits of propriety, but unable to let him get away with that. \"I hope  to be a wife and mother some day,\" she added, \"and I only hope that when  that time comes, I'll be able to lay good eggs.\"    \"Miss Morfatch,\" Stet said, keeping control of his temper with a visible  effort, \"that will be enough from you. If common decency doesn't  restrain you, please remember that I am your employer and that _I_ set  the policies on _my_ paper. You'll do what you're told and keep a civil  tongue in your head or you'll be sent back to Fizbus. Do I make myself  clear?\"    \"You do, indeed,\" Tarb said. How could she ever have thought he was  charming and handsome? Well, perhaps he still was handsome, but fine  feathers do not make fine deeds. And, if it came to that, it wasn't his  paper.    \"We have the same thing on Terra,\" Miss Snow murmured sympathetically to  Stet. \"These young whippersnappers think they can start in running the  paper the very first day. Why, Belinda Romney herself--she's a distant  cousin of mine, you know--told me--\"    \"Miss Snow,\" Tarb said, \"I hope for the sake of Earth that you are not a  typical example of the Terrestrial species.\"    \"And you, hon,\" Miss Snow retorted, \"don't belong on a paper, but in a  chicken coop.\"    \"Ladies!\" Stet said helplessly. \"Women,\" he muttered, \"certainly do not  belong on a newspaper. Matter of fact, they don't belong anywhere; their  place is in the home only because there's nowhere else to put them.\"    Both females glared at him.           *       *       *       *       *    During the next fortnight, Tarb gained fluency in Terran and also  learned to operate a Terrestrial typewriter equipped with Fizbian  type--mostly so that she could dispense with the services of the  invaluable Miss Snow. She didn't like typing, though--it chipped her  toenails and her temper. Besides, Drosmig kept complaining that the  noise prevented him from sleeping and she preferred him to sleep rather  than hang there making irrelevant and, sometimes, unpleasantly relevant  remarks.    \"Longing for the old scripto, eh?\" one of the cameramen smiled as he  lounged in the open doorway of her office. Although she was fond of  fresh air, Tarb realized that she would have to keep the door shut from  now on. Too many of the younger members of the staff kept booing at her  as they passed, and now they had formed the habit of dropping in to  offer her advice, encouragement and invitations to meals. At first, the  attention had pleased her--but now she was much too busy to be bothered;  she was going to turn out acceptable answers to those letters or die  trying.    \"Well, if the power can't be converted, it can't,\" she said grimly.  \"Griblo, I do wish you'd be a dear and flutter off. I--\"    He snorted. \"Who says the power can't be converted? Stet, huh?\"    She took her feet off the keys and looked at him. \"Why do you say 'Stet'  that way?\"    \"Because that's a lot of birdseed he gives you about not being able to  convert Earth power. Could be done all right, but he and the consul have  it all fixed up to keep Fizbian technology off the planet. Consul's  probably being paid off by the International Association of  Manufacturers and Stet's in it for the preservation of indigenous  culture--and maybe a little cash, too. After all, those rare antique  collections of his cost money.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" Tarb snapped. \"Griblo, please--I have so much work  to get through!\"    \"Okay, chick, but I warn you, you're going to have your bright-eyed  illusions shattered. Why don't you wake up to the truth about  Stet? What you should do is maybe eschew the society of all journalists  entirely, and a sordid lot they are, and devote yourself to  photographers--splendid fellows, all.\"    \"Please shut the door behind you!\"    The door slammed.    Tarb gazed disconsolately at the letter before her. Would she ever be  able to answer letters to Stet's satisfaction? The purpose of the whole  column was service--but did she and Stet mean the same thing by the same  word? Or, if they did, whom was Stet serving?    She was paying too much attention to Griblo's idle remarks. Obviously he  was a sorehead--had some kind of grudge against Stet. Perhaps Stet was a  bit too autocratic, perhaps he had even gone native to some extent, but  you couldn't say anything worse about him than that. All in all, he  wasn't a bad bird and she mustn't let herself be influenced by  rumormongers like Griblo.           *       *       *       *       *    Tarb got up and took the letter to Stet. He was in his office dictating  to Miss Snow. _After all_, Tarb could not repress the ugly thought, _why  should he care about the scriptos? He'll never have to use a  typewriter._    And he was perfectly nice about being interrupted. The only thing he  didn't like was being contradicted. _I'm getting bitter_, she told  herself in surprise. _And at my age, too.

So likewise  with the Jews of Italy, their commercial activities contributed  to their intellectual prosperity.  In the ninth century they  possessed rabbinical authorities, and in the tenth century,  centres [centers sic] of Talmudic study.  At this period, the  celebrated family of the Kalonymides went to Lorraine to  establish itself there.  For some time Mayence was the metropolis  of Judaism in the Rhine countries; and by its community the first  academies were established, the first Talmudic commentaries were  composed, and decisions were made which were accepted by all the  Jews of Christian Europe.  Soon this intellectual activity  extended to Worms, to Speyer, and a little later to the western  part of Germany and the northern part of France.[7]  A veritable  renaissance took place, parallel with the movement of ideas which  went on in the schools and convents of the eleventh and fourteenth  centuries;[8] for Jewish culture is often bound up with  the intellectual destinies of the neighboring peoples.    For some time the schools of Lorraine stood at the head of the  Talmudic movement, and it was to them that Rashi came a little  later to derive instruction.    One of the most celebrated offspring of the family of the  Kalonymides is Meshullam ben Kalonymos, who lived at Mayence in  the second half of the tenth century.  He was a Talmudist held in  high regard and the composer of liturgic poetry.  He devoted  himself to the regulation of the material and spiritual affairs  of his brethren.  Although he stood in correspondence with the  Babylonian masters, he was in a position to pass judgment  independently of them.  Communication with the East was frequent.  The communities of France and Germany sent disciples to the  Babylonians and submitted difficulties to them.  Tradition  relates that the Gaon Natronai (about 865) even visited France.  However that may be, the Jews of France at an early period were  acquainted with Babylonian works, both the chronicles and the  legal codes.    Other Talmudists of the tenth century are known, but rabbinical  literature may be said to have commenced only with Gershom ben  Judah (about 960-1028).  According to tradition his master was  his contemporary Hai Gaon; in reality he was the disciple of  Judah ben Meir ha-Cohen, surnamed Leontin (about 975).  Originally from Metz, Gershom established himself at Mayence, to  which a large number of pupils from neighboring countries soon  flocked in order to attend his school.  Thus he was the legatee of  the Babylonian academies, the decay of which became daily more  marked.  In his capacity as head of a school as in many other  respects, he was the true forerunner of Rashi, who carried on his  work with greater command of the subject and with more success.    Rabbenu Gershom not only gave Talmudic learning a fresh impetus  and removed its centre [center sic] to the banks of the Rhine,  but he also exerted the greatest and most salutary influence upon  the social life of his co-religionists, through his \"Decrees,\"  religious and moral, which, partly renewing older institutions,  were accepted by all the Jews of Christian countries.  Among  other things, he forbade polygamy.  He merits consideration in  two aspects, as a Gaon and as one to whom his disciples gave the  surname which still attaches to him, \"the Light of the Exile,\"  <I>Meor ha-Golah.</I>  Rashi said of him: \"Rabbenu Gershom has  enlightened the eyes of the Captivity; for we all live by his  instruction; all the Jews of these countries call themselves the  disciples of his disciples.\"    Gershom seems to have been the first Rhenish scholar who resorted  to the written word for the spread of his teachings.  He devoted  himself to the establishment of a correct text of the Bible and  the Talmud, and his chief work is a Talmudical commentary.    Since his time the continuity of learning has been uninterrupted.  The seed sown by Rabbenu Gershom was not long in germinating.  Schools began to multiply and develop in Lorraine.  The one at  Mayence prospered for a long time, and was eclipsed only by the  schools of Champagne.    A rabbi, Machir, the brother of Gershom, by his Talmudic lexicon  contributed likewise to the development of rabbinical knowledge.  His four sons were renowned scholars, contemporaries and  doubtless fellow-students of Rashi.    The disciples of Gershom, who continued the work of their master,  are of especial interest to us, because one of them, Simon the  Elder, was the maternal uncle of Rashi, and three others were his  masters.  These were Jacob ben Yakar, Isaac ha-Levi, and Isaac ben  Judah.  The latter two were disciples also of Eliezer ben Isaac  the Great, of Mayence.  Jacob ben Yakar and Isaac ha-Levi went to  Worms, where they became rabbis, while Isaac ben Judah remained  at Mayence, and directed the Talmudic school there.    About the middle of the eleventh century, then, an intellectual  ferment took place in France and Lorraine, earnest literary and  scientific activity manifested itself, and above all elements of  profound rabbinical culture became visible.  But one who should  regulate these forces was lacking, a guide to direct these  activities and to serve as a model to others.  In order that the  movement might not come to a premature end, a master was needed  who would give it impetus and define its course, who would strike  the decisive blow.  Such a man there was, a man who impressed his  contemporaries as a scholar of high degree and noble character,  and whose memory as such is still cherished by posterity.  This  man was Rashi.                               CHAPTER II                    THE YOUTH AND EDUCATION OF RASHI    Little is known concerning the life of Rashi.  Owing to various  causes not a single work is extant that might be used as a guide  for the establishment of minor facts.  Generally speaking, Jewish  literature in the middle ages was of an impersonal character;  practically no memoirs nor autobiographies of this period exist.  The disciples of the great masters were not lavish of information  concerning them.  They held their task to be accomplished when  they had studied and handed on the master's works; regard for his  teachings ranked above respect for the personality of the author.  But the figure of Rashi, as though in despite of all such  obstacles, has remained popular.  People wanted to know all the  details of his life, and they invented facts according to their  desires.  Fiction, however, fell short of the truth.  Legend does  not represent him so great as he must actually have been.  In the  present work, too, I shall be obliged to resort to comparisons  and analogies, to supplement by hypotheses the scanty information  afforded by history, yet I shall distinguish the few historic  facts from the mass of legends in which they are smothered.    As of old many cities in Greece asserted that they were the  birthplace of Homer, the national poet, so a number of cities  disputed for the honor of being the birthplace of Rashi, or of  having been his residence, or the scene of his death.  Worms  claimed him as one of its rabbis, Lunel, thanks to a confusion of  names, has passed as his birthplace, and Prague as the city of  his death.  One historian set 1105 as the year of his birth,  though in fact it is the year of his death.  Others placed it in  the thirteenth century, and still others even in the fourteenth.    In the course of this narrative other such instances will occur -  of fables, more or less ingenious, collected by chroniclers  lacking discrimination.  They may make pleasant reading, although  they contain no element of authenticity.  Besides, they are of  relatively recent date, and emanate to a large extent from Italy  and Spain, whose historians could count upon the credulity of  their readers to impose their inventions upon Jews and Christians  alike.    Confusion of this sort reigned in regard to Rashi's life until  1823, the year in which the illustrious Zunz published the essay  which established, not only his own, but also Rashi's reputation,  and brought Rashi forth from the shadow of legend into the full  light of history.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Zunz and other  scholars, such as Geiger, Weiss, Berliner, and Epstein, because,  with the legendary often superimposed upon the true, they have  made it easy to pick out the genuine from the false.  Now that  the result of their labors is before us, no great difficulty  attaches to the task of casting off legend from history, and  extracting from the legendary whatever historic material it  contains.                               I    In brushing aside all the myths with which the biography of  Rashi is cobwebbed, one finds, not a varied life, rich in  incident, but an entirely intellectual life, whose serenity was  undisturbed by excitement.    An event dividing Rashi's life into almost equal parts is his  taking up his residence at Troyes.  During the earlier period  he received his education, at first in the city of his birth,  then in the academies of Lorraine.  On his return to Troyes,  he had matured and was thoroughly equipped.  In the school  he founded there, he grouped pupils about him and wrote the  works destined to perpetuate his influence.    First of all, it is necessary to make Rashi's acquaintance, as it  were, to know the names he bore and those he did not bear.  An  example of the fantastic stories of which he was the hero is  afforded by the name Yarhi, which is sometimes still given to  him.  It does not date further back than the sixteenth century,  before which time he was called R. Solomon (Shelomo) by the Jews  of France, and R. Salomon ha-Zarfati (the Frenchman) by Jews  outside of France.  Christian scholars likewise called him R.  Salomo Gallicus, and also briefly R. Solomon, as the most  celebrated rabbi who ever bore that name. "]]]
