It was one  of the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer.    Now was the Wizard's turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:    \"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"    No one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had lost  his, somehow, in his flight through the air.    \"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief?\"    But they had no handkerchiefs, either.    \"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard.  \"I'll use my own hat, if you please.  Now, good people, observe me carefully.  You see, there is nothing up  my sleeve and nothing concealed about my person.  Also, my hat is quite  empty.\"  He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking it  briskly.    \"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer.    He took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to  the Wizard.    \"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing.\"    He placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and  then removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a  mouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal  in a tiny, shrill voice.    The people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,  big or little.  The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in his  hand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail  between the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the two  parts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant.    He placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulled  apart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these was  pulled apart, making four piglets.  The Wizard continued this  surprising performance until nine tiny piglets were running about at  his feet, all squealing and grunting in a very comical way.    \"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, I  will make something nothing again.\"    With this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed them together, so  that the two were one.  Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it  into the first, where it disappeared.  And so, one by one, the nine  tiny piglets were pushed together until but a single one of the  creatures remained.  This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made  a mystic sign above it.  When he removed his hat the last piglet had  disappeared entirely.    The little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him,  and then the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:    \"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater than  those of my Sorcerer.\"    \"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig.    \"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply.  \"I perceive  that you are curiously constructed, and that if you cannot breathe you  cannot keep alive.\"    The little man looked troubled.    \"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked.    \"About five minutes.  I'm going to begin now.  Watch me carefully.\"    He began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the  little man did not watch him long.  Instead, he drew a leathern case  from his pocket and took from it several sharp knives, which he joined  together, one after another, until they made a long sword.  By the time  he had attached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to  breathe, as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect.    So the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the  sharp sword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a  mighty stroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two.    Dorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the two  halves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had no  bones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was  cut looked much like a sliced turnip or potato.    \"Why, he's vegetable!\" cried the Wizard, astonished.    \"Of course,\" said the Prince.  \"We are all vegetable, in this country.  Are you not vegetable, also?\"    \"No,\" answered the Wizard.  \"People on top of the earth are all meat.  Will your Sorcerer die?\"    \"Certainly, sir.  He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly.  So we must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his  bush,\" continued the Prince.    \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled.    \"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince,  \"I will explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of our  Vegetable Kingdom.\"          4.  The Vegetable Kingdom      After the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken it  apart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man with  the star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of the  Sorcerer to the public gardens.    Jim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,  and wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper  to eat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to  ride with them.  The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and  the two children, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten  jumped upon his back and sat there quite contentedly.    So the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the  Sorcerer first, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the  strangers inside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had  no hearts and could neither smile nor frown.    The glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people lived  there; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a  broad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that  flowed through it.  There were paths through these gardens, and over  some of the brooks were ornamental glass bridges.    Dorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,  so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better.    \"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl.    \"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star.  \"They grow.\"    \"That's queer,\" said she.  \"Did the glass houses in your city grow,  too?\"    \"Of course,\" he replied.  \"But it took a good many years for them to  grow as large and fine as they are now.  That is why we are so angry  when a Rain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs.\"    \"Can't you mend them?\" she enquired.    \"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait until  they do.\"    They first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grew  nearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowers  they were, because the colors were constantly changing under the  shifting lights of the six suns.  A flower would be pink one second,  white the next, then blue or yellow; and it was the same way when they  came to the plants, which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground.    When they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched down  his head and began to nibble.    \"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has  to eat pink grass!\"    \"It's violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy.    \"Now it's blue,\" complained the horse.  \"As a matter of fact, I'm  eating rainbow grass.\"    \"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard.    \"Not bad at all,\" said Jim.  \"If they give me plenty of it I'll not  complain about its color.\"    By this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and the  Prince said to Dorothy:    \"This is our planting-ground.\"    Several Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in the  ground.  Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and  covered him up.  After that other people brought water from a brook and  sprinkled the earth.    \"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a large  bush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good  sorcerers.\"    \"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy.    \"Certainly,\" was the reply.  \"Do not all people grow upon bushes where  you came from, on the outside of the earth?\"    \"Not that I ever hear of.\"    \"How strange!  But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens  I will show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\"    It appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk through  the air with ease, usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way.  There were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,  but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do.    The little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few more  of the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a  garden enclosed by a high hedge.  Jim had refused to leave the field of  grass, where he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of  the buggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely  at their heels.    Inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome  plants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly  reached the ground.  In the center of each plant grew a daintily  dressed Mangaboo, for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon  them and was attached to their bodies.    The growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had just  turned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman.  On some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, a  half-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck were  motionless and silent, as if devoid of life.  This sight explained to  Dorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing she  had until now been unable to account for.    \"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their  bushes,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#5)"],[1,"waste has weathered longest, it is gradually  made fine enough to support the growth of plants, and is then  known as soil. The coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as  subsoil. Soil usually contains more or less dark, carbonaceous,  decaying organic matter, called humus, and is then often termed  the humus layer. Soil forms not only on waste produced in place  from the rock beneath, but also on materials which have been  transported, such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits.  Until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather  is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of  waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed. Why?    Any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern, or cut for road or  railway, will show the characteristics of the humus layer. It may  form only a gray film on the surface, or we may find it a layer a  foot or more thick, dark, or even black, above, and growing  gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations  into the subsoil. In some way the decaying vegetable matter  continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the  material beneath it.    HOW HUMUS AND THE SUBSOIL ARE MINGLED. The mingling of humus and  the subsoil is brought about by several means. The roots of plants  penetrate the waste, and when they die leave their decaying  substance to fertilize it. Leaves and stems falling on the surface  are turned under by several agents. Earthworms and other animals  whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for  food or to line their nests. Trees overthrown by the wind, roots  and all, turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together.  Bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment.  The animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the  making of soil. They bring the coarser fragments from beneath to  the surface, where the waste weathers more rapidly. Their burrows  allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to  affect it to greater depths.    ANTS. In the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by  ants. They excavate underground galleries and chambers, extending  sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface, and build  mounds which may reach as high above it. In some parts of Paraguay  and southern Brazil these mounds, like gigantic potato hills,  cover tracts of considerable area.    In search for its food--the dead wood of trees--the so-called  white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes,  reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches. On the  plateaus of central Africa explorers have walked for miles through  forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of  mud. Each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened  and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant, and is  thus acted on by organic chemical agents. Sooner or later these  galleries are beaten down by heavy rains, and their fertilizing  substances are scattered widely by the winds.    EARTHWORMS. In temperate regions the waste is worked over largely  by earthworms. In making their burrows worms swallow earth in  order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may  contain. They treat it with their digestive acids, grind it in  their stony gizzards, and void it in castings on the surface of  the ground. It was estimated by Darwin that in many parts of  England each year, on every acre, more than ten tons of earth pass  through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface,  and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over  by them.    In all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched.  Grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is  brought to the surface, and the rich organic matter which plants  and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under. Thus  Nature plows and harrows on \"the great world's farm\" to make ready  and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her  crops.    The world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away  are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals. The  organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic, and because  the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to  live upon the earth.    SOLAR ENERGY. The source of the energy which accomplishes all this  necessary work is the sun. It is the radiant energy of the sun  which causes the disintegration of rocks, which lifts vapor into  the atmosphere to fall as rain, which gives life to plants and  animals. Considering the earth in a broad way, we may view it as a  globe of solid rock,--the lithosphere,--surrounded by two mobile  envelopes: the envelope of air,--THE ATMOSPHERE, and the envelope  of water,--THE HYDROSPHERE. Under the action of solar energy these  envelopes are in constant motion. Water from the hydrosphere is  continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere, the air of the  atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere,--for its gases are  dissolved in all waters,--and both air and water enter and work  upon the solid earth. By their action upon the lithosphere they  have produced a third envelope,--the mantle of rock waste.    This envelope also is in movement, not indeed as a whole, but  particle by particle. The causes which set its particles in  motion, and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume,  we will now proceed to study.    MOVEMENTS OF THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE    At the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only  that the rocks were crumbling away, but also that grains and  fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to  the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea. This  process is going on everywhere. Slowly it may be, and with many  interruptions, but surely, the waste of the land moves downward to  the sea. We may divide its course into two parts,--the path to the  stream, which we will now consider, and its carriage onward by the  stream, which we will defer to a later chapter.    GRAVITY. The chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is  gravity. Each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull  of the earth's mass and follows it when free to do so. All  agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in  motion, and therefore cooperate with gravity. On cliffs, rocks  fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees, and when  detached by any other agency. On slopes of waste, water freezes in  chinks between stones, and in pores between particles of soil, and  wedges them apart. Animals and plants stir the waste, heat expands  it, cold contracts it, the strokes of the raindrops drive loose  particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall. Of  all these movements, gravity assists those which are downhill and  retards those which are uphill. On the whole, therefore, the  downhill movements prevail, and the mantle of waste, block by  block and grain by grain, creeps along the downhill path.    A slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle  of 17 degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the  slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month.  Explain why it did so.    RAIN. The most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the  streams is the rain. It moves particles of soil by the force of  the blows of the falling drops, and washes them down all slopes to  within reach of permanent streams. On surfaces unprotected by  vegetation, as on plowed fields and in arid regions, the rain  wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in  exposures of unaltered rock (Fig. 17).    At the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by  creep and wash to the depth of several feet; while where the  hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin, or quite  absent, because removed about as fast as formed. Against the walls  of an abbey built on a slope in Wales seven hundred years ago, the  creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven  feet. The slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences  and walls, whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to  show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side,  especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by  vegetation.    TALUS. At the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope  of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above. Such a  heap of waste is known as talus. The amount of talus in any place  depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its  removal. Talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical  disintegration is most effective, where rocks are readily broken  into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than  massive, and where they are firm enough to be detached in  fragments of some size instead of in fine grains. Talus is removed  slowly where it decays slowly, either because of the climate or  the resistance of the rock. It may be rapidly removed by a stream  flowing along its base.    In a moist climate a soluble rock, such as massive limestone, may  form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away. A  loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains,  which in dry climates, where unprotected by vegetation, may be  blown away as fast as they fall, leaving the cliff bare to the  base. Cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite  when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts.    Talus slopes may be so steep as to reach THE ANGLE OF REPOSE, i.e.  the steepest angle at which the material will lie. This angle  varies with different materials, being greater with coarse and  angular fragments than with fine rounded grains. Sooner or later a  talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its  surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above."]]]
