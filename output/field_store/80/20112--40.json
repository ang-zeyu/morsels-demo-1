Not only have economical systems generally been made up of  unproven hypotheses, but they have rarely evinced any such clear  apprehension and constructive ability as are essential in the  formation and statement of principles; and down to the chaos of Mr.  Mills's last essay there is scarcely a volume on political economy  which rewards the wearied attention with any more than a vague  understanding of the shadowy design that existed in the author's  brain.    In the eminently original and scientific work of Mr. Colton we see  economy subjected to fundamental and ultimate methods of investigation  of which the results have a mathematical certainty. We have new facts,  new reasonings, new deductions; and if the paramount ideas are not  altogether original, they are discovered by original processes, and  their previous existence is but an illustration of the truth that the  instinctive perspicacity of the common mind often surpasses the  logical faculty in recognizing laws before they are discovered from  elements and relations. Mr. Colton has not rejected the title  \"_political_ economy\" because he proposed to enter a different field,  or because the subject and argument have no relation to politics, but  chiefly because the term has been so much abused in the rude agitation  of what are commonly called politics, that he does not think it  comports with the dignity of the theme; and the second part of his  title is adopted from a conviction that the economical principles of  states _are to be deduced from their separate experience and adapted  to their individual condition_. The task which he proposed to himself  is, the exhibition of the merits of the protective and free trade  systems as they apply to the United States. He expresses at the outset  his opinion that the settlement of the question is one of the most  desirable, and will be one of the most important results which remain  to be achieved in the progress of the country; and we can assure him  that the accomplishment of it will be rewarded by the best approval of  these times, and an enduring name. The second chapter of his work is a  statement of the new points which it embraces. By new points he does  not mean that all thus described are entirely original, though many of  them are so; but that on account of the importance of the places he  has assigned them as compared with those they occupy in other works of  the kind, they are entitled to be presented as new. Many of them  involve fundamental and pervading principles that have not hitherto  appeared in speculations on the subject, but which are destined to an  important influence in its discussion. Some of the most prominent are,  that public economy is the application of knowledge, derived from  experience, to given positions, interests and institutions, for the  increase of wealth; that it has never been reduced to a science, and  that the propositions of which it has been for the most part composed,  down to this time, are empirical; that protective duties in the United  States are not taxes, and that a protective system rescues the country  from a system of foreign taxation; that popular education is a  fundamental element of public economy; that freedom is a thing of  commercial value, and that the history of freedom for all time, shows  it to be identical with protection.    Recently the renewal of his voice has enabled Mr. Colton to devote  more attention to the favorite pursuit of his life, and he is a very  frequent preacher, in French or English. He resides in New-York.          A GLANCE AT THE WATERING PLACES.    [Illustration: THE YOUNG MARRIED GENTLEMAN WHO \"COULD NOT POSSIBLY GO  TO THE SPRINGS.\"]      All the gay world of the cities, and even of the villages and country  homes, who can do so, by the first of August are \"going,\" or \"gone,\"  as Mr. John Keese says of a last invoice, to the watering places, and  other summer resorts, which serve as fairs for the disposal of  valueless time and \"remainders\" of marriageable daughters. With the  crowds intent on speculation are a few invalids, a few students of  human nature, and the common proportion of mere lookers-on, who have  no purpose but to be amused. Times have changed, manners have changed,  since Paulding gave us his _Mirror for Travellers_, though Saratoga  still maintains the ascendency she was then acquiring, and for certain  inalienable natural advantages is likely to do so for a part at least  of every season.    New-York is the grand rendezvous: once settled in our hotels, the  splendid Astor, the comfortable American, the busy Irving, the gay  New-York, or the quiet Union Place or Clarendon, the stranger has  little desire to go further, until the last and imperative demands of  Fashion compel him to abandon the study of those noble institutions we  described in the last _International_, and to forego the observation  of those great public works in which the energy of our rich men has  flowered, or those appointments of Providence which render New-York a  rival of Dublin, Naples, or Constantinople, in scenic magnificence.    Many indeed who come from distant parts of the country, linger all  summer in the vicinity of the city, in the hottest days quitting  Broadway for a sail or drive, to the Bath House, Rockaway, Coney  Island, New Brighton, Long Branch, or Fort Hamilton, where they dine,  or perhaps stay over night. At Fort Hamilton, indeed, Mr. Clapp is apt  to keep those who venture into his hotel, with its luxurious tables,  pleasant rooms, cool breezes from the ocean, and fair sights in all  directions, for a much longer time; and every one of these places, in  the hot months, has attractions that would make a visitor at the Spas  of France, Germany, or Italy, could he wake in them, think he had  eluded the watchful guard St. Peter keeps at the gateway of another  retirement, to the which, it may be feared, the gay world has far less  anxiety to go.    [Illustration: FORT HAMILTON HOUSE, LONG ISLAND.]    [Illustration: PROPOSED SUMMER HOTEL AT THE HIGHLANDS OF NEVERSINK.]    Ascending the Hudson, from the social metropolis of this continent, to  which all \"capitals\" of states or nations, from Patagonia to  Greenland, are in some way subject and tributary, the traveller finds  the palace in which he rides, continually near embowered pavilions for  the public, and clusters of private residences, which but add to their  enjoyableness. Cozzens's Hotel at West Point, is perhaps as well  known as any house of the same class in the world, and its picturesque  situation, as well as the admirable manner in which it is kept, will  preserve for it a place in the list of favorite resorts. The Catskill  Mountain House, in the midst of grand and peculiar scenery, on the  verge of a rock two thousand and five hundred feet above the  Hudson--seen with its various fleets at a distance from the long  colonnade--is thronged even more than West Point. There are other  pleasant houses on the river, and many turn from its various points to  visit newer or less crowded places than Saratoga along the lines of  the western railroads, as Trenton Falls, Sharon Springs, or Avon, or  further still, the towns by the borders of the great lakes.    [Illustration: CATSKILL MOUNTAIN HOUSE.]    [Illustration: HOTEL AT TRENTON FALLS.]    Saratoga is now for several weeks the gayest scene of all. At the  United States Hotel, with its fine grounds, are the leaders of  fashion; at Congress Hall, with its clean and quiet rooms and  unsurpassed _cuisine_, are representatives of the substantial families  that have had grandfathers, and in the dozen or twenty smaller houses  about the village are \"all sorts and conditions of men,\" and eke of  women. With drives, dinners, flirtations, drinking of drinks, and,  once in a long while, imbibitions of a little congress water, all goes  merry as a marriage bell--except with ladies of uncertain ages who are  disappointed of that blessed music--until the Grand Ball gives signal  for departure to other places.    [Illustration: SARATOGA SPRINGS.]    [Illustration]    [Illustration: THE NOTCH HOUSE, WHITE MOUNTAINS.]    From Saratoga parties go northward to Lake George, (for which region,  of the most romantic beauty, they should be prepared by a perusal of  Dudley Bean's admirable sketch of its revolutionary history;) and down  the Champlain toward Montreal, whence they return by way of the  Ontario and Niagara Falls (where our engraver Orr's _Pictorial Guide  Book_ is indispensable to the best enjoyment), or go through the  glorious hills of northern Vermont and New Hampshire to the White  Mountains. All the last grand region has been most truthfully and  effectively represented in a small folio volume of drawings from  nature, by Isaac Sprague, described by William Oakes, and published in  Boston by Crosby & Nichols. We commend the book to summer tourists.    [Illustration: NIAGARA FALLS.]    [Illustration: OCEAN HOUSE, NEWPORT.]    A considerable proportion of the guests who are at Saratoga in the  earlier part of the season, proceed to Newport in time for the Fancy  Ball which every year closes the campaign there. Newport increases in  attractions. Its historical associations, fine atmosphere, beautiful  position, and facilities for sea-bathing, fishing, sailing, riding,  and other amusements, are continually drawing to its neighborhood new  families, whose cottages add much to the beauty of the town, as they  themselves to the pleasantness of its society; and for transient  visitors no place in the world has better hotels or boarding-houses.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, VIRGINIA.]    After the season closes at Newport, and from her Ocean House the last  unwilling traveller has taken his way, strewn with regrets, many  linger at the more quiet summer haunts scattered through New-England  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36131"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 3, June, 1851 (#5)"],[1,"teep, narrow staircase leading out of this       arcade into one of the houses above it, from which we were       to witness the leaping into the fountain. I looked out of       the window on the crowd that began to collect around the       fountain, and noticed the tall roofs and handsome fronts of       the houses opposite, and the crowd of pigeons--scores and       scores of pigeons--assembled just opposite the fountain on       the edge of the steep roof which rose like a red hill-side       behind them. They seemed solemnly met to witness the great       festivities about to be celebrated, and sat in silent       expectation brooding in the sunshine. Then, I wondered what       attraction the icy water could have for the children who       leaned over the fountain's side--dabbling in the water as       though it had been midsummer. The crowd increased and       increased; and seven new white buckets were brought and       placed on a broad plank which extended across one side of       the fountain basin.         \"A shout from the crowd announced the arrival of the       Butchers. First of all came the tender Butcher-infants, in       scarlet coats, top-boots, and green velvet hats, borne in       the arms of their fathers through the crowd in order that       they might witness the fun. Then followed the scarlet       officials:--and then came seven of the queerest beasts man       ever set eyes on. What were they, if human? Were they seven       Esquimaux chiefs, or seven African mumbo-jumbos? They were       the heroes of the day--the seven Butcher-apprentices,       clothed in fur caps and garments--covered from shoulder to       heel with hundreds of dangling calves' tails--red, white,       black, dun!         \"You may imagine the shouts that greeted them,--the peels of       laughter. Up they sprang on the broad plank,--leaping,       dancing, making their tails fly round like trundled mops.       The crowd roared with laughter. A stately scarlet       official--a butcher (_Altgesell_)--stands beside them on the       plank. Ten times they drink the health of the royal family       and prosperity to the butchers' craft. The _Altgesell_ then       striking many blows on the shoulder of the nearest       apprentice, frees him and all the remaining six from their       indentures. They are henceforth full-grown butchers. Then,       they plunge into the very centre of the fountain with a       tremendous splash. The crowd shout,--the startled pigeons       wheel in wild alarm above the heads and laughter of the       crowd. The seven Tritons dash torrents of water on the       multitude,--who fly shrieking and laughing before the       deluge. The seven buckets are plied with untiring       arms;--lads are enticed within aim by showers of nuts flung       by the 'Leapers,' and then are drenched to the skin. It is a       bewilderment of water, flying calves' tails, pelting nuts,       and shrieking urchins.         \"The 'Leapers' then ascend out of their bath,--shake       themselves like shaggy dogs,--have white cloths pinned round       their necks as though they were going to be shaved,--and       have very grand medals hung round their necks suspended by       gaudy ribbons.         \"The procession retires across the market-place to its       '_Herberge_,' and the crowd disperses,--but disperses only       to re-assemble in various public-houses for the merriment of       the afternoon and night. That night and the next day are       'the maddest, merriest of all the year.' Music is every       where--dancing every where. It is the end of the Carnival.       Ash Wednesday comes,--and then, all is gloom.\"          NEGLECT OF THE PRESERVATION OF EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES.      A writer in the London _Athenaeum_, writing from Alexandria, endeavors  to convince those who profess an interest in Egyptian antiquities,  that if their present neglect continues, nothing will remain of the  stupendous relics now lying over the land, but a quantity of  pulverized fragments. The colossal statue at Memphis, said to belong  to the British Museum, for years depended on the precarious protection  of an old Arab woman, who was continually expecting and claiming a  small salary of five or six pounds per annum as guardian. She received  about so much from a variety of consuls, for a time, but the payment  was at last discontinued, and, from what was told her, she based her  hopes on the learned or the powerful in England. \"But the learned and  the powerful never, I suppose,\" says the writer, \"heard of her, and  she died, leaving the statue in charge of her son, who, in his turn,  seems to live in hope. There is little prospect of his getting any  thing, however; and very probably, in spite of his unrewarded zeal,  the magnificent statue--by far the finest in Egypt--will ere long be  burnt for lime. The neighboring pyramid of Dashour is being, as I have  already said, worked as a quarry, and I shall be very much surprised  if this handy block of stone escape notice.\" He suggests the formation  of a committee, consisting of the principal consuls and residents in  Egypt, to watch over the preservation of the monuments of the country,  and to be supplied, by governments or by the voluntary contributions  of the learned, with the funds necessary to pay guardians and  inspectors.    A very valuable museum of Egyptian antiquities we believe is now on  the way to the United States; but it embraces no such great works as  have been transported to Rome and Paris. Is it not worth while for the  New-York merchants to set up in Union or Washington Square, the great  statue of Memphis?    Or it would not be altogether inappropriate for the Smithsonian  Institution to have it imported into Washington. How much the  diffusion of \"knowledge\" would be promoted by such a movement it is  not easy to say: but a figure of this kind on Capitol Hill would have  such an effect on our eloquence! and our juvenile poets could go there  and in its shade invoke the presence of twenty centuries.          HENRY ROWE SCHOOLCRAFT.    [Illustration]      Mr. Schoolcraft is of English descent by the paternal side, his  great-grandfather having come from England during the wars of Queen  Anne, and settled in what is now Schoharie county in New-York, where  in old age he taught the first English school in that part of the  country, from which circumstance his name was not unnaturally changed  by the usage of the people from Calcraft to Schoolcraft. Our author  recently attempted in his own person to revive the old family name,  but soon abandoned it, and concluded to retain that which was begotten  upon his native soil, and by which he has long been so honorably  distinguished. He is a son of Colonel Lawrence Schoolcraft, who joined  the revolutionary army at seventeen years of age, and participated in  the movements under Montgomery and Schuyler, and the memorable defence  of Fort Stanwix under Gansevoort. He was born in Guilderland, near  Albany, on the twenty-eighth of March, 1793. In a secluded part of the  country, where there were few advantages for education, and scarce any  persons who thought of literature, he had an ardent love of knowledge,  and sat at home with his books and pencils while his equals in age  were at cock-fights and horse-races, for which Guilderland was then  famous. He is still remembered by some of the octogenarians of the  village as the \"learned boy.\" At thirteen he drew subjects in natural  history, and landscapes, which attracted the attention of the late  Lieutenant-Governor Van Rensselaer, then a frequent visitor of his  father, through whose agency he came near being apprenticed to one  Ames, the only portrait-painter at that time in Albany; but as it was  demanded that he should commence with house-painting the plan was  finally abandoned. At fourteen he began to contribute pieces in prose  and verse to the newspapers, and for several years after he pursued  without aid the study of natural history, English literature, Hebrew,  German, and French, and the philosophy of language.    Mr. Schoolcraft's first work was an elaborate treatise, but partially  known to the public, entitled Vitreology, which was published in 1817.  The design of it was to exhibit the application of chemistry to the  arts in the fusion of siliceous and alkaline substances in the  production of enamels, glass, etc. He had had opportunities of  experimenting largely and freely by his position as conductor for a  series of years of the extensive works of the Ontario Company at  Geneva in New-York, the Vermont Company at Middlebury and Salisbury in  Vermont, and the foundry of crystal glass at Keene in New Hampshire.  In 1818, and the following year, he made a geological survey of  Missouri and Arkansas to the spurs of the Rocky Mountains, and in the  fall of 1819 published in New-York his View of the Lead Mines of  Missouri, which is said by Professor Silliman to have been \"the only  elaborate and detailed account of a mining district in the United  States\" which had then appeared. It attracted much attention, and  procured for the author the friendship of many eminent men. In the  same year he printed Transallegania, a poetical _jeu d'esprit_ of  which mineralogy is the subject, and which preceded some clever  English attempts in the same vein. It was republished in London by Sir  Richard Phillips in the next year.    Early in 1820 he published a Journal of a Tour in the Interior of  Missouri and Arkansas, extending from Potosi toward the Rocky  Mountains. His writings having attracted the notice of the government,  he was commissioned by Mr. Calhoun, then Secretary of War, to visit  the copper region of Lake Superior, and to accompany General Cass in  his expedition to the head waters of the Mississippi. His Narrative  Journal of this tour was published in 1821, and was eminently  successful, an edition of twelve hundred copies being sold in a few"]]]
