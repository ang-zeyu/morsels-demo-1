Dey hung dem bof  at de same time an' from de same lim' of de tree, but dat was way back  yonder befo' Mistah Lincoln come down here to set de niggers free. My  mammy wuzn' but six months ole den an' I wuzn' even bawn, but Aunt  Becky tole me 'bout it when I was ole enough to lissen.    \"Dis ain' no nice tale you gwine hear. It's de truf, but 'tain't nice.  De fus' time I heard it I didn' sleep none for a week. Everytime I shut  my eyes I seed Marse Drew Norwood wid dat funnel in his mouf an' de hot  steam blowin' up like a cloud 'roun' his wicked face an' skeered eyes.    \"Dey say my gran'pappy's Ole Marse was de meanes' white man de Lawd  ever let breath de breaf of life. His name was Marse Drew Norwood. He  was de riches' lan' owner anywhare 'roun'. He owned more lan' an' more  niggers den anybody in Person or Granville counties. But he didn' make  his money wid no farm, no suh, he sho didn', he made his money buyin'  an' sellin' niggers. He bought dem cheap an' sold dem high. He would  catch all de niggers dat run away from other plantations an' keep dem  in his lockup 'twell he fatten dem, den he would take dem way off down  in Georgia, Alabama or some place like dat an' sell dem for a big  price. He would come back wid his pockets runnin' over wid money. Some  folks say he stold niggers to sell, but nobody never could catch him.    \"Marse Drew lived over here on de Virginia line 'tween Red Bank an'  Blue Wing. He owned lan' 'cross de No'th Carolina line too an' lived  close to Blue Wing. He treated his niggers so mean dey was all de time  runnin' off. If he caught dem he beat dem near 'bout to death. He did  beat Cindy Norwood to death one time kaze she run off to Marse Reuben  Jones place an' axed him to keep her. She got pizen in de cut places on  her back an' had fits three days befo' de Lawd took her. But Marse Drew  jus' laugh an' say he didn' keer; dat she wuzn' no 'count nohow.    \"I ain't never seed Marse Drew kaze I was bawn way after de niggers was  freed, but dey tole me he looked like a mad bull. He was short wid a  big head set forward on his big shoulders. His neck was so short dat he  couldn' wear no collar; he jus' kept de neck bindin' of his shirt  pinned wid a diaper pin. De debil done lit a lamp an' set it burnin' in  his eyes; his mouf was a wicked slash cut 'cross his face, an' when he  got mad his lips curled back from his teef like a mad dog's. When he  cracked his whip de niggers swinged an' de chillun screamed wid pain  when dat plaited thong bit in dey flesh. He beat Mistis too. Mis' Cary  wuzn' no bigger den a minute an' she skeered as a kildee of Marse Drew.  She didn' live long dey say kaze Marse Drew whipped her jus' befo' dey  fus' baby wuz bawn.    \"Marse Drew done whip Luzanne kaze she burnt de biscuits, an' Mis' Cary  give her some salve to rub on de cut places on her back. When Marse  Drew foun' it out he got so mad dat he come back to de big house an'  tole Mis' Cary dat he gwine touch her up wid his whip kaze she give  Luzanne de salve, dat when he want his niggers doctored he gwine  doctor dem hese'f, so he got to use his lash a little bit to make her  remember.    \"Mis' Cary got so skeered dat she run 'roun' an' 'roun' de house, but  Marse Drew run after her, an' every now an' den he th'ow out dat  plaited whip an' curl it 'roun' her shoulders. Every time it hit it cut  clean through her clothes. Mis' Cary got so skeered dat de baby come  dat night befo' 'twuz time. De baby wuz bawn dead an' Mis' Cary went on  to glory wid it. Dey say she was glad to go. Yes, suh, everything on  dat plantation, animal an' man was skeered of dat whip--dat whip dat  never lef' Marse Drew's wris'. It was made of home-tanned leather  plaited in a roun' cord big as a man's thum'. All day it swung from a  leather strop tied to his wris' an' at night it lay on a chair 'side de  bed whare he could reach it easy.    \"It was jus' befo' de Yankees come over here to fight dat Marse Drew  bought Cleve an' Lissa Lawson. Dey was my gran'mammy an' gran'pappy. My  mammy den was a baby. Marse Drew bought dem for fo' hundred an' fifty  dollars. Dat was cheap kaze de niggers was young wid hard farm  trainin'. Ole Marse didn' buy mammy. He said a nigger brat wuzn' no  good, dey wouldn' sell an' dey might die befo' dey growed up, 'sides  dey was a strain on de mammy what breas' nussed it. Lissa cut up  powerful kaze he made her leave de baby behin', but Marse Drew jus'  laughed an' tole her dat he would give her a puppy; dat dey was plenty  of houn's on de plantation. Den he snapped de chains on dey wris' an'  led dem off. Lissa an' Cleve never seed dat baby no more. Aunt Beck  Lawson took an' raised her an' when she got grown she was my mammy.    \"Yes, suh, Marse Drew bought dem niggers like he was buyin' a pair of  mules. Dey wuzn' no more den mules to him. It was early summer when he  brung dem to de plantation, but when wheat cuttin' time come Lissa an'  Cleve was sent to de wheat fiel's. Dey was smart niggers, dey worked  hard--too hard for dey own good. In dem times 'twuz de smart, hard  workin' niggers dat brought de bes' price, an' nobody didn' know dat  better den Marse Drew.    \"One day Cleve seed Marse Drew watchin' Lissa. She was gleamin' de  wheat. Her skin was de color of warm brown velvet; her eyes was dark  an' bright an' shinin' like muscadines under de frosty sun, an' her  body was slender like a young tree dat bends easy. As she stooped an'  picked up de wheat, flingin' it 'cross her arm, she swayed back an'  fo'th jus' like dem saplins down yonder by de creek sways in de win'.    \"Cleve watched Marse Drew on de sly. He seed him watchin' Lissa. He  seed de lustful look in his eyes, but 'twuzn' Lissa he lustin' after;  'twuz money he seed in her slender swayin' body, in de smooth warm  brown skin, an' de quick, clean way she gleam de wheat. Stripped to de  wais' on de Alabama auction block she would bring near 'bout a thousan'  dollars. Cleve 'gun to sweat. He turned so sick an' skeered dat he  could hardly swing de scythe through de wheat. Marse Drew done took his  baby away, an' now sumpin' way down in his heart told him dat he was  gwine take Lissa. He didn' keer if he parted dem, 'twuz dollars he seed  swingin' 'roun' his head--gol' dollars shinin' brighter den stars.    \"'Twuz de nex' day dat Marse Drew went to Cleve's cabin. He walk up  whistlin' an' knock on de door wid de butt of his whip.    \"Cleve opened de door.    \"Ole Marse tole him to pack Lissa's clothes, dat he was takin' her to  Souf Boston de nex' day to sell her on de block.    \"Cleve fell on his knees an' 'gun to plead. He knew Ole Marse wuzn'  gwine take Lissa to no Souf Boston; he was gwine take her way off an'  he wouldn' never see her no more. He beg an' promise Marse Drew to be  good an' do anything he say [HW: to] do if he jus' leave him Lissa, dat  she was his wife an' he love her. But Marse Drew hit him 'cross de face  wid his whip, cuttin' his lip in half, den he went over an' felt of  Lissa's arms an' legs like she might have been a hoss.    \"When he done gone Cleve went over an' set down by Lissa an' took her  han'. Lissa 'gun to cry, den she jumped up an' 'menced to take down her  clothes hangin' on de wall.    \"Cleve watched her for a while, den he made up his min' he gwine do  sumpin', dat she ain't gwine be took away from him. He say: 'Quit dat,  Lissa, leave dem clothes alone. You ain't gwine leave me, you ain't  gwine nowhare, hear me?' Den he tole her to make up a hot fire while he  brung in de wash pot. He brung in de big iron pot an' set it on de  hearth an' raked de' red coals all 'roun' it, den he filled it wid  water. While it was heatin' he went to de door an' looked out. De sun  done gone down an' night was crowdin' de hills, pushin' dem out of  sight. By daylight dat white man would be comin' after Lissa.    \"Cleve turned 'roun' an' looked at Lissa. She was standin' by de wash  pot lookin' down in de water, an' de firelight from de burnin'  lightwood knots showed de tears droppin' off her cheeks. Cleve went  outside. 'Bout dat time a scritch owl come an' set on de roof an'  scritched. Lissa run out to skeer it away, but Cleve caught her arm. He  say, 'Don't do dat, Lissa, leave him alone.

Te Pahi happened to be at Whangaroa  when the _Boyd_ was captured in 1809, and he did his best to save some  of the crew from the terrible slaughter that followed. But his presence  at the scene was enough to give a handle to his enemies. They accused  him to the whalers of participation in the outrage, and these stormed  the island _pa_ by night and slaughtered the unsuspecting inhabitants.  Te Pahi himself escaped with a wound, but he was soon afterwards killed  by the real authors of the _Boyd_ massacre for his known sympathy with  the Europeans.    It is a piteous story, and one that reflects only too faithfully the  temper of the times. Hardly less piteous is the history of his young  kinsman, Ruatara, the inheritor of his influence over the tribe. This  notable man, while still young, determined that he too would see the  world, and in the year 1805 engaged himself as a common sailor on board  a whaling vessel. The roving life suited his adventurous temperament,  and in spite of many hardships and much foul play he served in one ship  after another. His duties carried him more than once to Port Jackson,  where he, too, met Samuel Marsden and talked about the projected mission  to his race. After many vicissitudes he at length nearly attained the  object of his desire, for his ship reached the Thames and cast anchor  below London Bridge. Now he would see the king, and would learn the  secret of England's power.    But the London of those days was a cruel place. There were no kindly  chaplains, no sailors' institutes nor waterside missions for the care of  those who thronged its waterways. There was little care for the poor  anywhere, and little religion among employers or employed. The close of  the eighteenth century was indeed the low-water mark of English religion  and morality. But by 1809--the year of Ruatara's arrival--an improvement  had begun. What is known as the Evangelical movement was changing the  tone of life and thought. The excesses of the French Revolution had led  to a reaction among the upper classes and made them think more  seriously. This revival did not at once lead to much thought for the  poor at home; it reached out rather towards the heathen abroad. The  \"Romantic\" school was in the ascendant, and a black skin under a  palm-tree formed a picture which appealed to the awakened conscience.  Much of the fervour of the time had its being outside the historic  Church of England, but in the last year of the old century a few earnest  clergy and laity--without much encouragement from the bishops or others  in high places--had formed what was afterwards known as \"The Church  Missionary Society.\" This Society had the New Zealanders under its  consideration at the very time when Ruatara was being starved and beaten  in the docks of London itself.    What had drawn its attention to a place so distant? It was the presence  of Marsden in England. He had come thither in 1807 on business of grave  and various import. The Government of the day had recognised the value  of his practical knowledge, and had sought his advice on many matters  concerning the welfare of Australia. But he did not forget New Zealand,  and it was to the young Church Missionary Society that he betook  himself. So great, in fact, and so various were the plans which Marsden  entertained for the welfare of the many races in which he was  interested, that the grandiloquent words of his biographer seem not too  strong: \"As the obscure chaplain from Botany Bay paced the Strand, from  the Colonial Office at Whitehall to the chambers in the city where a few  pious men were laying plans for Christian missions in the southern  hemisphere, he was in fact charged with projects upon which not only the  civilisation, but the eternal welfare, of future nations were  suspended.\"    Marsden's proposals were the outcome of his own original mind. He  appealed for a mission to the Maoris, but he wished it to be an  industrial mission. He proposed that artisans should be sent out who  should prepare the way for ordained clergy. A carpenter, a smith, and a  twine-spinner should form the missionary staff. They must be men of  sound piety and lively interest in the spiritual welfare of the heathen;  but their religious lessons should be given whilst they were instructing  the Maoris in the building of a house, the forging of a bolt, or the  spinning of their native flax.    Such a scheme was only half relished by the Committee of the Society.  These excellent men had hardly yet realised that the dark-skinned  savage was a real human being. They had begun by picturing the whole  population of a heathen island as rushing gladly to meet the missionary,  receiving his message with unquestioning belief, and crying out in an  agony of terror, \"What must we do to be saved?\" Now that apparent  failure had met their efforts in different parts of the world, they were  inclined to go to the opposite extreme and to despair of the heathen  ever accepting Christianity at all. Marsden's unromantic proposals  jarred upon their old ideas, but in their perplexity they could not help  feeling that at least here was a man who had had experience of real, not  of imaginary, heathen; a man who did not despair, and who had a definite  and carefully prepared plan. Gradually they yielded to his influence,  and, especially as clerical missionaries were not to be found, they  agreed to seek for the artisans.    Even these were hard enough to find. There were as yet no colleges for  the training of young aspirants; outside the newly-formed societies  there was little interest in the welfare of heathen people; the best  that could be done was to seek for men who had the love of God and men  in their hearts, and should seem to possess the qualities of patience,  perseverance, and tact. Through the good offices of friendly clergy two  young men were found. From distant Carlisle came the carpenter, William  Hall; the Midlands supplied a shoemaker, John King. These were given  further technical training--Hall in shipbuilding, King in rope-making.  By the month of August, 1809, they were ready for their enterprise.  Their earthly prospects were not tempting. They were to receive L20 each  per annum until they should be able to grow corn enough for their own  support. To meet this and all other expenses the Committee advanced  Marsden the sum of L100. With this small sum and his two plain and  poorly paid mechanics, this undaunted man started out from his native  land to undertake the evangelisation of a country as large as England  itself.    But a mightier coadjutor was at hand. Many prayers were offered as the  _Ann_ was about to sail, and it must surely have been in answer to these  that, when the vessel with her freight of convicts had already reached  Gravesend, there appeared a boat in which were a half-naked Maori  together with a seafaring Englishman. These were Ruatara and his  employer who had robbed him of his wages and had now no further use for  him. \"Will you take him back to Australia?\" said the heartless master.  \"Not unless you find him some clothes,\" said the captain of the _Ann_.  The clothes were procured, and the Maori was allowed to go below. There  he lay sick in body and mind. He had tried to play the part of the  Russian Peter, but he was bringing back nothing for the benefit of his  country. What was left but to die?    When the ship reached Portsmouth, Marsden came on board, and on August  25th she finally started on her six months' voyage. Not for some days  did the chaplain know of the Maori's presence, but, as the ship entered  warmer latitudes, Marsden observed on the forecastle among the sailors a  man whose dark skin and forlorn condition appealed strongly to his  sympathy. Ruatara was wrapped in an old great coat, racked with a  violent cough, and was bleeding from the lungs. Though young, he seemed  to have but a few days to live. Marsden at once went to him and found in  the miserable stranger the nephew of his old acquaintance Te Pahi.  Kindness and attention soon had their effect; the health of the invalid  rapidly improved; the remembrance of past injuries melted away before  the sunshine of Christian love; and, before the ship reached Australia,  Ruatara was once again a man, and now almost a Christian.    This meeting was momentous in its results. \"Mr. Marsden and Ruatara,\" as  Carleton says, \"were each necessary to the other; each furnished means  without which the labour of his associate must have been thrown away.  But for the determined support which Ruatara as a high chief was able  to afford, Marsden could never have gained a footing in the land; and  without the sustained labour of the civilised European, the work of the  Maori innovator, too much in advance of its time, would have withered  like Jonah's gourd, and have come to an end with the premature decease  of Ruatara.\"    For a few days after the arrival of the _Ann_ at Port Jackson, it seemed  as though Marsden's project were going to be helped by another  unexpected agency. The Sydney merchants had resolved to form a trading  settlement in New Zealand; the settlers were chosen, and the ship was  ready to sail. But at the last moment news came from the land of their  destination of an event already referred to--news which for many a long  day checked every thought of adventure thither, and had the effect of  throwing New Zealand back into its old position of isolation and  aloofness. The ship _Boyd_, which had sailed from Sydney not many months  previously, had been surprised by the Maoris in the harbour of  Whangaroa, and with four exceptions all its white crew, to the number of  about 70 persons, had been killed and cooked and eaten.
