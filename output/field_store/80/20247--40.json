[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#5)"],[1,"    At the outset, the Express reduced the time for letters from New York to  the Coast from twenty-three days to about ten days. Before the line had  been placed in operation, a telegraph wire, allusion to which has been  made, had been strung two hundred and fifty miles Eastward from San  Francisco through Sacramento to Carson City, Nevada. Important official  business from Washington was therefore wired to St. Joseph, then  forwarded by pony rider to Carson City where it was again telegraphed to  Sacramento or San Francisco as the case required, thus saving twelve or  fifteen hours in transmission on the last lap of the journey. The usual  schedule for getting dispatches from the Missouri River to the Coast was  eight days, and for letters, ten days.    After the triumphant first trip, when it was fully evident that the Pony  Express[8] was a really established enterprise, the St. Joseph Free  Democrat broke into the following panegyric:    Take down your map and trace the footprints of our quadrupedantic  animal: From St. Joseph on the Missouri to San Francisco, on the Golden  Horn--two thousand miles--more than half the distance across our  boundless continent; through Kansas, through Nebraska, by Fort Kearney,  along the Platte, by Fort Laramie, past the Buttes, over the Rocky  Mountains, through the narrow passes and along the steep defiles, Utah,  Fort Bridger, Salt Lake City, he witches Brigham with his swift  ponyship--through the valleys, along the grassy slopes, into the snow, into  sand, faster than Thor's Thialfi, away they go, rider and horse--did  you see them? They are in California, leaping over its golden sands,  treading its busy streets. The courser has unrolled to us the great  American panorama, allowed us to glance at the homes of one million  people, and has put a girdle around the earth in forty minutes. Verily  the riding is like the riding of Jehu, the son of Nimshi for he rideth  furiously. Take out your watch. We are eight days from New York,  eighteen from London. The race is to the swift.    The Pony Express had been tried at the tribunal of popular opinion and  given a hearty endorsement. It had yet to win the approval of shrewd  statesmanship.

[4] Reports as to the precise hour of starting do not all agree. It was  probably late in the afternoon or early in the evening, no later than  6:30.    [5] Authorities differ somewhat as to the personnel of the first trip;  also as to the number of letters carried.    [6] On account of the Mormon outbreak and the troubles of 1857-58, there  was at this time much ill-feeling in Congress against Utah. Matters were  finally smoothed out and the bill in question was of course dropped.  Utah was loyal to the Union throughout the Civil War.    [7] Eastbound the first rider carried about seventy letters.    [8] The idea of a Pony Express was not a new one in 1859. Marco Polo  relates that Genghis Khan, ruler of Chinese Tartary had such a courier  service about one thousand years ago. This ambitious monarch, it is  said, had relay stations twenty-five miles apart, and his riders  sometimes covered three hundred miles in twenty-four hours.    About a hundred years back, such a system was in vogue in various  countries of Europe.    Early in the nineteenth century before the telegraph was invented, a New  York newspaper man named David Hale used a Pony Express system to  collect state news. A little later, in 1830, a rival publisher, Richard  Haughton, political editor of the New York Journal of Commerce borrowed  the same idea. He afterward founded the Boston Atlas, and by making  relays of fast horses and taking advantage of the services offered by a  few short lines of railroad then operating in Massachusetts, he was  enabled to print election returns by nine o'clock on the morning after  election.    This idea was improved by James W. Webb, Editor of the New York Courier  and Enquirer, a big daily of that time. In 1832, Webb organized an  express rider line between New York and Washington. This undertaking  gave his paper much valuable prestige.    In 1833, Hale and Hallock of the Journal of Commerce started a rival  line that enabled them to publish Washington news within forty-eight  hours, thus giving their paper a big \"scoop\" over all competitors.  Papers in Norfolk, Va., two hundred and twenty-nine miles south-east of  Washington actually got the news from the capitol out of the New York  Journal of Commerce received by the ocean route, sooner than news  printed in Washington could be sent to Norfolk by boat directly down the  Potomac River.    The California Pony Express of historic fame was imitated on a small  scale in 1861 by the Rocky Mountain News of Denver, then, as now, one of  the great newspapers of the West. At that time, this enterprising daily  owned and published a paper called the Miner's Record at Tarryall, a  mining community some distance out of Denver. The News also had a branch  office at Central City, forty-five miles up in the mountains. As soon as  information from the War arrived over the California Pony Express and by  stage out of old Julesburg from the Missouri River--Denver was not on  the Pony Express route--it was hurried to these outlying points by fast  horsemen. Thanks to this enterprise, the miners in the heart of the  Rockies could get their War news only four days late.--Root and  Connelley.          Chapter IV    Operation, Equipment, and Business      On entering the service of the Central Overland California and Pike's  Peak Express Company, employees of the Pony Express were compelled to  take an oath of fidelity which ran as follows:    \"I, ----, do hereby swear, before the Great and Living God, that during  my engagement, and while I am an employe of Russell, Majors & Waddell, I  will, under no circumstances, use profane language; that I will drink no  intoxicating liquors; that I will not quarrel or fight with any other  employe of the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct myself  honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct all my acts as to win  the confidence of my employers. So help me God.\"[9]    It is not to be supposed that all, nor any considerable number of the  Pony Express men were saintly, nor that they all took their pledge too  seriously. Judged by present-day standards, most of these fellows were  rough and unconventional; some of them were bad. Yet one thing is  certain: in loyalty and blind devotion to duty, no group of employees  will ever surpass the men who conducted the Pony Express. During the  sixteen months of its existence, the riders of this wonderful  enterprise, nobly assisted by the faithful station-keepers, travelled  six hundred and fifty thousand miles, contending against the most  desperate odds that a lonely wilderness and savage nature could offer,  with the loss of only a single mail. And that mail happened to be of  relatively small importance. Only one rider was ever killed outright  while on duty. A few were mortally wounded, and occasionally their  horses were disabled. Yet with the one exception, they stuck grimly to  the saddle or trudged manfully ahead without a horse until the next  station was reached. With these men, keeping the schedule came to be a  sort of religion, a performance that must be accomplished--even though  it forced them to play a desperate game the stakes of which were life  and death. Many station men and numbers of riders while off duty were  murdered by Indians. They were martyrs to the cause of patriotism and a  newer and better civilization. Yet they were hirelings, working for good  wages and performing their duties in a simple, matter-of-fact way. Their  heroism was never a self-conscious trait.    The riders were young men, seldom exceeding one hundred and twenty-five  pounds in weight. Youthfulness, nerve, a wide experience on the frontier  and general adaptability were the chief requisites for the Pony Express  business. Some of the greatest frontiersmen of the latter 'sixties and  the 'seventies were trained in this service, either as pony riders or  station men. The latter had even a more dangerous task, since in their  isolated shacks they were often completely at the mercy of Indians.    That only one rider was ever taken by the savages was due to the fact  that the pony men rode magnificent horses which invariably outclassed  the Indian ponies in speed and endurance. The lone man captured while on  duty was completely surrounded by a large number of savages on the  Platte River in Nebraska. He was shot dead and though his body was not  found for several days, his pony, bridled and saddled, escaped safely  with the mail which was duly forwarded to its destination. That far more  riders were killed or injured while off duty than when in the saddle was  due solely to the wise precaution of the Company in selecting such  high-grade riding stock. And it took the best of horseflesh to make the  schedule.    The riders dressed as they saw fit. The average costume consisted of a  buckskin shirt, ordinary trousers tucked into high leather boots, and a  slouch hat or cap. They always went armed. At first a Spencer carbine  was carried strapped to the rider's back, besides a sheath knife at his  side. In the saddle holsters he carried a pair of Colt's revolvers.  After a time the carbines were left off and only side arms taken along.  The carrying of larger guns meant extra weight, and it was made a rule  of the Company that a rider should never fight unless compelled to do  so. He was to depend wholly upon speed for safety. The record of the  service fully justified this policy.    While the horses were of the highest grade, they were of mixed breed and  were purchased over a wide range of territory.

Charles at that moment came in  sight, and at once saw the act. Without pausing to take off his clothes  or any part of them, he sprang at once into the pond and dove down for  the dog; but he found the stone about its neck too heavy for him to  bring to the surface, though he struggled long and stoutly to do so  before he yielded.    Swimming to the shore, Charles took his knife from his pocket, and once  more dashed in; and this time diving down he cut the cord, and releasing  the dog from the bottom swam with him to the opposite shore from where  Robert stood, all the while threatening him. Here his younger brother  smoothed the water from the dog's coat, and instinctively rubbing its  benumbed limbs until it became quite resuscitated, and after a short  time, following close to Charles for protection, it returned to his  mother's side in her boudoir. But Robert had been there before him, and  had already manufactured a story redounding to Charles's discredit, and  provoking both his mother's and father's anger, the latter of whom at  Robert's instance, even struck the gallant-hearted boy a severe blow  with the flat of his hand as a punishment for what he denominated an  interference with his brother's sport.    Charles said nothing; he knew the prejudice which Robert's constant  misrepresentations had created against him in his parents' breasts; he  realized too, young as he was, that it was useless for him to attempt to  explain, though he felt the injustice of this treatment; and so with a  quivering lip he turned away from the scene and went in his wet clothes  to the servants' hall where he might dry them. He said nothing, but  looked much sadder than usual as he stood there before the fire. A  coarse but honest servant, Leonard Hust, who had been born on the  estate, and whose father before him had been a servant in Sir Robert's  household, came stealthily to Charles's side and busied himself in  helping him to arrange his clothes and dry them, while he smoothed the  boy's hair and wiped his face.    \"Never mind, master Charles,\" said the honest fellow, noticing the  trembling lips of the handsome boy; \"never mind, it's a gallant act in  you, and though I say it, who shouldn't, perhaps, master Robert never  would have dared to do it; he hasn't got half your courage and strength,  though he's bigger and older.\"    A tear was all the answer that the boy vouchsafed to his honest effort  at consolation. He too proud to make a confidant of the servant, or to  confide to him of his father's conduct, or even that of Robert. Leonard  Hust watched the boy carefully, and entered keenly into his feelings,  until at last he said:    \"I wasn't the only one who saw you save her ladyship's pet, master  Charles.\"    \"It wasn't father or mother that saw it?\" asked Charles, quickly, as he  recalled the injustice he had just experienced at their hands, under  Robert's prompting.    \"No, master Charles.\"    \"Was it cousin Helen?\" continued the boy.    \"Yes, master Charles,\" answered Leonard Hust, with a knowing smile.    \"O,\" said the boy, as a glow of pleasure lit up his features for a  moment.    It was evident that the knowledge of the said cousin Helen's having seen  his exertions to save the little favorite spaniel, gave Charles not a  little satisfaction. Now cousin Helen--as a little blue-eyed child of  eight years, the daughter of the family whose estate joined that of  Bramble Park, was called--was no cousin at all, but the children had  thus nicknamed each other, and they were most happy playmates together.  Robert, who was three years his brother's senior, was more fond of  little Helen than of anybody else; indeed, in spite of his ill temper,  he was wont to try and please her at any cost. But the child, who was as  beautiful as a little fairy, did not respond at all to his advances of  friendship, while to Charles she was all tenderness and confiding in  everything, kissing him with childish fervor and truth whenever they  parted, a familiarity she never permitted to his brother.    The truth was, Robert to his great discomfiture, was aware that  Charles's manly and courageous act of saving the dog had been witnessed  by Helen, though his brother knew it not until told by Leonard Hust.  This had aggravated Robert so much that he had hastened home, and  fabricating a story of Charles having thrown the dog into the pond, and  wet himself completely, preparing his parents for a rough reception of  his brother when he should return, and hence the treatment he received.  Leonard made his young master change his clothes, and after making him  comfortable, left him to amuse himself in the open park with his ball,  where the light-hearted Charles was soon thoughtlessly happy, and  forgetful of the unkindness of Robert and the injustice of his parents.  So light are the cares and mishaps of youth, so easily forgotten are its  hardships, either seeming or real. Happy childhood!    Whether little cousin Helen had been on the watch for Charley, or  whether she was there by accident, it matters not, suffice it to say  that the two soon met in their headlong career of fun and frolic, and  two more joyous or merry spirits never met on the soft green sward than  these. Now they tire of the play at ball and sit down together close by  the brink of the clear, deep pond, next the rich flower beds that shed  their grateful fragrance around the spot. Cousin Helen, still panting  from the exertion of the play, looked thoughtfully into the almost  transparent water, and involuntarily heaved a sigh that did not escape  her companion's notice.    \"Art sick, cousin Helen?\" asked Charles, quickly.    \"Nay, not I,\" said the pleasant-voiced child, \"not I, Charley.\"    \"But you sighed as though you were very tired or in pain,\" he continued.    \"Did I?\" said the child, thoughtfully; \"well, I believe I did.\"    \"And what for, cousin Helen?\" said Charles, tenderly, parting her  natural ringlets back from her beautiful and radiant face--doubly  radiant now as she looked up into his, so confidingly and so  affectionately.    \"I was thinking,\" she said, ingenuously, \"how cruel Robert was to your  mother's pet. I don't see how he could do such a thing, do you,  Charley?\"    \"Robert is quick-tempered,\" said his brother, \"and perhaps regrets it  now. I guess the dog bit him, or something of that sort.\"    He was too generous, too manly, to complain of Robert's cruel treatment  of him, or to mention the unkindness he had experienced from his  parents. But he had not forgotten these occurrences, and his lip once  more quivered with emotion, and his clear, handsome eyes were suffused  with tears. Quick as thought his little companion divined with womanly  instinct the cause, for she was not ignorant of the state of affairs,  young as she was, that existed at Bramble Park. Drawing nearer to his  side, she threw one arm tenderly and with childish abandon over his  neck, and with the other brushed away the gathering tears, until Charles  smiled again and leaned over and kissed her sweet little lips as a  brother might have done! And then together they plucked a beautiful  bouquet, and busied themselves in arranging it and classifying the  various plants by their botanical names, for both children were well  versed in this delightful study, young as they were.    While they were thus engaged, Robert came up and angrily discovered the  two children thus happy together. Saying some rude things to Charles, he  pushed him away from his playmate's side with rude and brutal force,  throwing Charles to the ground. This was too much, even for his  forbearing spirit, and the injured and outraged boy, smarting under the  previous injury he had endured, rose quickly to his feet, and with one  blow knocked Robert heavily upon the ground. The blow had been a severe  one, and the boy was faint and unable to stand for a moment. Charles  looked at him for an instant, then helped to raise him up, and waited  until he was again sufficiently conscious to walk. Then he saw him walk  angrily toward the house, where he knew very well what would follow on  his return there. All the while his little companion had stood regarding  first one and then the other. Now Charles stepped to her side, and said:    \"I am sorry, Helen; but it is very, very hard to bear.\"    She shook her little head as he spoke, but held up her lips for the kiss  he offered, and saw him turn away from home towards the distant town.          CHAPTER V.    THE NAVAL OFFICER.      THE reader will think that seven league boots--the storyteller's  prerogative--are in special demand as it regards our story, for once  more we must return through a period of years to the date, or  thereabouts, on which our story opens. It was on one of those close,  sultry afternoons that characterize the climate of summer in India, that  two of our characters were seated together in a graceful and rather  elegant villa in the environs of Calcutta. The air of the lady--for the  couple were of either sex, was one of beauty in repose. She was  evidently listening to the gallant speech of her companion with respect,  but without interest, while on his part the most casual observer might  have read in his voice, his features, and his words, the accent, the  bearing, the language of love.    The lady was a gentle being of surpassing beauty, with black eyes, jetty  hair and brilliant complexion; there was little of the characteristics  of the East in her appearance, though she seemed to be quite at home  beneath the Indian Sun. She was of the middle height, perhaps a little  too slender and delicate in form to meet a painter's idea of perfection,  but yet just such an idol as a poet"]]]
