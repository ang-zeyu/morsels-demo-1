VII. It is not, however, to be expected that either the mute language  of early Christianity (however important a part of the expression of the  building at the time of its erection), or the delicate fancies of the  Gothic leafage springing into new life, should be read, or perceived, by  the passing traveller who has never been taught to expect anything in  architecture except five orders: yet he can hardly fail to be struck by  the simplicity and dignity of the great shafts themselves; by the frank  diffusion of light, which prevents their severity from becoming  oppressive; by the delicate forms and lovely carving of the pulpit and  chancel screen; and, above all, by the peculiar aspect of the eastern  extremity of the church, which, instead of being withdrawn, as in later  cathedrals, into a chapel dedicated to the Virgin, or contributing by  the brilliancy of its windows to the splendor of the altar, and  theatrical effect of the ceremonies performed there, is a simple and  stern semicircular recess, filled beneath by three ranks of seats,  raised one above the other, for the bishop and presbyters, that they  might watch as well as guide the devotions of the people, and discharge  literally in the daily service the functions of bishops or _overseers_  of the flock of God.    Sec. VIII. Let us consider a little each of these characters in  succession; and first (for of the shafts enough has been said already),  what is very peculiar to this church, its luminousness. This perhaps  strikes the traveller more from its contrast with the excessive gloom  of the Church of St. Mark's; but it is remarkable when we compare the  Cathedral of Torcello with any of the contemporary basilicas in South  Italy or Lombardic churches in the North. St. Ambrogio at Milan, St.  Michele at Pavia, St. Zeno at Verona, St. Frediano at Lucca, St. Miniato  at Florence, are all like sepulchral caverns compared with Torcello, where  the slightest details of the sculptures and mosaics are visible, even  when twilight is deepening. And there is something especially touching  in our finding the sunshine thus freely admitted into a church built by  men in sorrow. They did not need the darkness; they could not perhaps  bear it. There was fear and depression upon them enough, without a  material gloom. They sought for comfort in their religion, for tangible  hopes and promises, not for threatenings or mysteries; and though the  subjects chosen for the mosaics on the walls are of the most solemn  character, there are no artificial shadows cast upon them, nor dark  colors used in them: all is fair and bright, and intended evidently to  be regarded in hopefulness, and not with terror.    Sec. IX. For observe this choice of subjects. It is indeed possible that  the walls of the nave and aisles, which are now whitewashed, may have  been covered with fresco or mosaic, and thus have supplied a series of  subjects, on the choice of which we cannot speculate. I do not, however,  find record of the destruction of any such works; and I am rather  inclined to believe that at any rate the central division of the  building was originally decorated, as it is now, simply by mosaics  representing Christ, the Virgin, and the apostles, at one extremity, and  Christ coming to judgment at the other. And if so, I repeat, observe the  significance of this choice. Most other early churches are covered with  imagery sufficiently suggestive of the vivid interest of the builders in  the history and occupations of the world. Symbols or representations of  political events, portraits of living persons, and sculptures of  satirical, grotesque, or trivial subjects are of constant occurrence,  mingled with the more strictly appointed representations of scriptural  or ecclesiastical history; but at Torcello even these usual, and one  should have thought almost necessary, successions of Bible events do not  appear. The mind of the worshipper was fixed entirely upon two great  facts, to him the most precious of all facts,--the present mercy of  Christ to His Church, and His future coming to judge the world. That  Christ's mercy was, at this period, supposed chiefly to be attainable  through the pleading of the Virgin, and that therefore beneath the  figure of the Redeemer is seen that of the weeping Madonna in the act of  intercession, may indeed be matter of sorrow to the Protestant beholder,  but ought not to blind him to the earnestness and singleness of the  faith with which these men sought their sea-solitudes; not in hope of  founding new dynasties, or entering upon new epochs of prosperity, but  only to humble themselves before God, and to pray that in His infinite  mercy He would hasten the time when the sea should give up the dead  which were in it, and Death and Hell give up the dead which were in  them, and when they might enter into the better kingdom, \"where the  wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.\"    Sec. X. Nor were the strength and elasticity of their minds, even in the  least matters, diminished by thus looking forward to the close of all  things. On the contrary, nothing is more remarkable than the finish and  beauty of all the portions of the building, which seem to have been  actually executed for the place they occupy in the present structure.  The rudest are those which they brought with them from the mainland; the  best and most beautiful, those which appear to have been carved for  their island church: of these, the new capitals already noticed, and the  exquisite panel ornaments of the chancel screen, are the most  conspicuous; the latter form a low wall across the church between the  six small shafts whose places are seen in the plan, and serve to enclose  a space raised two steps above the level of the nave, destined for the  singers, and indicated also in the plan by an open line _a b c d_. The  bas-reliefs on this low screen are groups of peacocks and lions, two  face to face on each panel, rich and fantastic beyond description,  though not expressive of very accurate knowledge either of leonine or  pavonine forms. And it is not until we pass to the back of the stair of  the pulpit, which is connected with the northern extremity of this  screen, that we find evidence of the haste with which the church was  constructed.    Sec. XI. The pulpit, however, is not among the least noticeable of its  features. It is sustained on the four small detached shafts marked at  _p_ in the plan, between the two pillars at the north side of the  screen; both pillars and pulpit studiously plain, while the staircase  which ascends to it is a compact mass of masonry (shaded in the plan),  faced by carved slabs of marble; the parapet of the staircase being also  formed of solid blocks like paving-stones, lightened by rich, but not  deep, exterior carving. Now these blocks, or at least those which adorn  the staircase towards the aisle, have been brought from the mainland;  and, being of size and shape not easily to be adjusted to the  proportions of the stair, the architect has cut out of them pieces of  the size he needed, utterly regardless of the subject or symmetry of the  original design. The pulpit is not the only place where this rough  procedure has been permitted: at the lateral door of the church are two  crosses, cut out of slabs of marble, formerly covered with rich  sculpture over their whole surfaces, of which portions are left on the  surface of the crosses; the lines of the original design being, of  course, just as arbitrarily cut by the incisions between the arms, as  the patterns upon a piece of silk which has been shaped anew. The fact  is, that in all early Romanesque work, large surfaces are covered with  sculpture for the sake of enrichment only; sculpture which indeed had  always meaning, because it was easier for the sculptor to work with some  chain of thought to guide his chisel, than without any; but it was not  always intended, or at least not always hoped, that this chain of  thought might be traced by the spectator. All that was proposed appears  to have been the enrichment of surface, so as to make it delightful to  the eye; and this being once understood, a decorated piece of marble  became to the architect just what a piece of lace or embroidery is to a  dressmaker, who takes of it such portions as she may require, with  little regard to the places where the patterns are divided. And though  it may appear, at first sight, that the procedure is indicative of  bluntness and rudeness of feeling, we may perceive, upon reflection,  that it may also indicate the redundance of power which sets little  price upon its own exertion. When a barbarous nation builds its  fortress-walls out of fragments of the refined architecture it has  overthrown, we can read nothing but its savageness in the vestiges of  art which may thus chance to have been preserved; but when the new work  is equal, if not superior, in execution, to the pieces of the older art  which are associated with it, we may justly conclude that the rough  treatment to which the latter have been subjected is rather a sign of  the hope of doing better things, than of want of feeling for those  already accomplished. And, in general, this careless fitting of ornament  is, in very truth, an evidence of life in the school of builders, and of  their making a due distinction between work which is to be used for  architectural effect, and work which is to possess an abstract  perfection; and it commonly shows also that the exertion of design is so  easy to them, and their fertility so inexhaustible, that they feel no  remorse in using somewhat injuriously what they can replace with so  slight an effort.    Sec. XII. It appears however questionable in the present instance,  whether, if the marbles had not been carved to his hand, the architect  would have taken the trouble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#5)"],[1,"ec. XXV. It was above stated, that the principal difference in general  form and treatment between the Byzantine and Gothic palaces was the  contraction of the marble facing into the narrow spaces between the  windows, leaving large fields of brick wall perfectly bare. The reason  for this appears to have been, that the Gothic builders were no longer  satisfied with the faint and delicate hues of the veined marble; they  wished for some more forcible and piquant mode of decoration,  corresponding more completely with the gradually advancing splendor of  chivalric costume and heraldic device. What I have said above of the  simple habits of life of the thirteenth century, in no wise refers  either to costumes of state, or of military service; and any  illumination of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries (the great  period being, it seems to me, from 1250 to 1350), while it shows a  peculiar majesty and simplicity in the fall of the robes (often worn  over the chain armor), indicates, at the same time, an exquisite  brilliancy of color and power of design in the hems and borders, as well  as in the armorial bearings with which they are charged; and while, as  we have seen, a peculiar simplicity is found also in the _forms_ of the  architecture, corresponding to that of the folds of the robes, its  _colors_ were constantly increasing in brilliancy and decision,  corresponding to those of the quartering of the shield, and of the  embroidery of the mantle.    Sec. XXVI. Whether, indeed, derived from the quarterings of the knights'  shields, or from what other source, I know not; but there is one  magnificent attribute of the coloring of the late twelfth, the whole  thirteenth, and the early fourteenth century, which I do not find  definitely in any previous work, nor afterwards in general art, though  constantly, and necessarily, in that of great colorists, namely, the  union of one color with another by reciprocal interference: that is to  say, if a mass of red is to be set beside a mass of blue, a piece of the  red will be carried into the blue, and a piece of the blue carried into  the red; sometimes in nearly equal portions, as in a shield divided into  four quarters, of which the uppermost on one side will be of the same  color as the lowermost on the other; sometimes in smaller fragments,  but, in the periods above named, always definitely and grandly, though  in a thousand various ways. And I call it a magnificent principle, for  it is an eternal and universal one, not in art only,[4] but in human  life. It is the great principle of Brotherhood, not by equality, nor by  likeness, but by giving and receiving; the souls that are unlike, and  the nations that are unlike, and the natures that are unlike, being  bound into one noble whole by each receiving something from, and of, the  others' gifts and the others' glory. I have not space to follow out this  thought,--it is of infinite extent and application,--but I note it for  the reader's pursuit, because I have long believed, and the whole second  volume of \"Modern Painters\" was written to prove, that in whatever has  been made by the Deity externally delightful to the human sense of  beauty, there is some type of God's nature or of God's laws; nor are any  of His laws, in one sense, greater than the appointment that the most  lovely and perfect unity shall be obtained by the taking of one nature  into another. I trespass upon too high ground; and yet I cannot fully  show the reader the extent of this law, but by leading him thus far. And  it is just because it is so vast and so awful a law, that it has rule  over the smallest things; and there is not a vein of color on the  lightest leaf which the spring winds are at this moment unfolding in the  fields around us, but it is an illustration of an ordainment to which  the earth and its creatures owe their continuance, and their Redemption.    Sec. XXVII. It is perfectly inconceivable, until it has been made a  subject of special inquiry, how perpetually Nature employs this principle  in the distribution of her light and shade; how by the most extraordinary  adaptations, apparently accidental, but always in exactly the right  place, she contrives to bring darkness into light, and light into  darkness; and that so sharply and decisively, that at the very instant  when one object changes from light to dark, the thing relieved upon it  will change from dark to light, and yet so subtly that the eye will not  detect the transition till it looks for it. The secret of a great part  of the grandeur in all the noblest compositions is the doing of this  delicately in _degree_, and broadly in _mass_; in color it may be done  much more decisively than in light and shade, and, according to the  simplicity of the work, with greater frankness of confession, until, in  purely decorative art, as in the illumination, glass-painting, and  heraldry of the great periods, we find it reduced to segmental accuracy.  Its greatest masters, in high art, are Tintoret, Veronese, and Turner.    Sec. XXVIII. Together with this great principle of quartering is  introduced another, also of very high value as far as regards the delight  of the eye, though not of so profound meaning. As soon as color began to  be used in broad and opposed fields, it was perceived that the mass of it  destroyed its brilliancy, and it was _tempered_ by chequering it with  some other color or colors in smaller quantities, mingled with minute  portions of pure white. The two moral principles of which this is the  type, are those of Temperance and Purity; the one requiring the fulness  of the color to be subdued, and the other that it shall be subdued  without losing either its own purity or that of the colors with which it  is associated.    Sec. XXIX. Hence arose the universal and admirable system of the diapered  or chequered background of early ornamental art. They are completely  developed in the thirteenth century, and extend through the whole of  the fourteenth gradually yielding to landscape, and other pictorial  backgrounds, as the designers lost perception of the purpose of their  art, and of the value of color. The chromatic decoration of the Gothic  palaces of Venice was of course founded on these two great principles,  which prevailed constantly wherever the true chivalric and Gothic spirit  possessed any influence. The windows, with their intermediate spaces of  marble, were considered as the objects to be relieved, and variously  quartered with vigorous color. The whole space of the brick wall was  considered as a background; it was covered with stucco, and painted in  fresco, with diaper patterns.    Sec. XXX. What? the reader asks in some surprise,--Stucco! and in the  great Gothic period? Even so, but _not stucco to imitate stone_. Herein  lies all the difference; it is stucco confessed and understood, and laid  on the bricks precisely as gesso is laid on canvas, in order to form them  into a ground for receiving color from the human hand,--color which, if  well laid on, might render the brick wall more precious than if it had  been built of emeralds. Whenever we wish to paint, we may prepare our  paper as we choose; the value of the ground in no wise adds to the value  of the picture. A Tintoret on beaten gold would be of no more value than  a Tintoret on coarse canvas; the gold would merely be wasted. All that  we have to do is to make the ground as good and fit for the color as  possible, by whatever means.    Sec. XXXI. I am not sure if I am right in applying the term \"stucco\" to  the ground of fresco; but this is of no consequence; the reader will  understand that it was white, and that the whole wall of the palace was  considered as the page of a book to be illuminated: but he will  understand also that the sea winds are bad librarians; that, when once  the painted stucco began to fade or to fall, the unsightliness of the  defaced color would necessitate its immediate restoration; and that  therefore, of all the chromatic decoration of the Gothic palaces, there  is hardly a fragment left.    Happily, in the pictures of Gentile Bellini, the fresco coloring of the  Gothic palaces is recorded, as it still remained in his time; not with  rigid accuracy, but quite distinctly enough to enable us, by comparing  it with the existing colored designs in the manuscripts and glass of the  period, to ascertain precisely what it must have been.    Sec. XXXII. The walls were generally covered with chequers of very warm  color, a russet inclining to scarlet, more or less relieved with white,  black, and grey; as still seen in the only example which, having been  executed in marble, has been perfectly preserved, the front of the Ducal  Palace. This, however, owing to the nature of its materials, was a  peculiarly simple example; the ground is white, crossed with double bars  of pale red, and in the centre of each chequer there is a cross,  alternately black with a red centre and red with a black centre where  the arms cross. In painted work the grounds would be, of course, as  varied and complicated as those of manuscripts; but I only know of one  example left, on the Casa Sagredo, where, on some fragments of stucco, a  very early chequer background is traceable, composed of crimson  quatrefoils interlaced, with cherubim stretching their wings filling the  intervals. A small portion of this ground is seen beside the window  taken from the palace, Vol. II. Plate XIII. fig. 1.    Sec. XXXIII. It ought to be especially noticed, that, in all chequered  patterns employed in the colored designs of these noble periods, the  greatest care is taken to mark that they are _grounds_ of design rather  than designs themselves. Modern architects, in such minor imitations as  they are beginning to attempt, endeavor to dispose the parts in the  patterns so as to occupy certain symmetrical positions with respect to  the parts of the architecture. A Gothic builder never "]]]
