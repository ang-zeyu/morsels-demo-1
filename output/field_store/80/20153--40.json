Many a citizen  was proud to welcome the Deacon to supper, and dismissed him with regret  at a timeous hour, who would have been vastly disconcerted had he known  how soon, and in what guise, his visitor returned.  Many stories are told  of this redoubtable Edinburgh burglar, but the one I have in my mind most  vividly gives the key of all the rest.  A friend of Brodie's, nested some  way towards heaven in one of these great _lands_, had told him of a  projected visit to the country, and afterwards, detained by some affairs,  put it off and stayed the night in town.  The good man had lain some time  awake; it was far on in the small hours by the Tron bell; when suddenly  there came a creak, a jar, a faint light.  Softly he clambered out of bed  and up to a false window which looked upon another room, and there, by  the glimmer of a thieves' lantern, was his good friend the Deacon in a  mask.  It is characteristic of the town and the town's manners that this  little episode should have been quietly tided over, and quite a good time  elapsed before a great robbery, an escape, a Bow Street runner, a  cock-fight, an apprehension in a cupboard in Amsterdam, and a last step  into the air off his own greatly-improved gallows drop, brought the  career of Deacon William Brodie to an end.  But still, by the mind's eye,  he may be seen, a man harassed below a mountain of duplicity, slinking  from a magistrate's supper-room to a thieves' ken, and pickeering among  the closes by the flicker of a dark lamp.                     [Picture: Planestones Close, Canongate]    Or where the Deacon is out of favour, perhaps some memory lingers of the  great plagues, and of fatal houses still unsafe to enter within the  memory of man.  For in time of pestilence the discipline had been sharp  and sudden, and what we now call 'stamping out contagion' was carried on  with deadly rigour.  The officials, in their gowns of grey, with a white  St. Andrew's cross on back and breast, and a white cloth carried before  them on a staff, perambulated the city, adding the terror of man's  justice to the fear of God's visitation.  The dead they buried on the  Borough Muir; the living who had concealed the sickness were drowned, if  they were women, in the Quarry Holes, and if they were men, were hanged  and gibbeted at their own doors; and wherever the evil had passed,  furniture was destroyed and houses closed.  And the most bogeyish part of  the story is about such houses.  Two generations back they still stood  dark and empty; people avoided them as they passed by; the boldest  schoolboy only shouted through the keyhole and made off; for within, it  was supposed, the plague lay ambushed like a basilisk, ready to flow  forth and spread blain and pustule through the city.  What a terrible  next-door neighbour for superstitious citizens!  A rat scampering within  would send a shudder through the stoutest heart.  Here, if you like, was  a sanitary parable, addressed by our uncleanly forefathers to their own  neglect.    And then we have Major Weir; for although even his house is now  demolished, old Edinburgh cannot clear herself of his unholy memory.  He  and his sister lived together in an odour of sour piety.  She was a  marvellous spinster; he had a rare gift of supplication, and was known  among devout admirers by the name of Angelical Thomas.  'He was a tall,  black man, and ordinarily looked down to the ground; a grim countenance,  and a big nose.  His garb was still a cloak, and somewhat dark, and he  never went without his staff.'  How it came about that Angelical Thomas  was burned in company with his staff, and his sister in gentler manner  hanged, and whether these two were simply religious maniacs of the more  furious order, or had real as well as imaginary sins upon their old-world  shoulders, are points happily beyond the reach of our intention.  At  least, it is suitable enough that out of this superstitious city some  such example should have been put forth: the outcome and fine flower of  dark and vehement religion.  And at least the facts struck the public  fancy and brought forth a remarkable family of myths.  It would appear  that the Major's staff went upon his errands, and even ran before him  with a lantern on dark nights.  Gigantic females, 'stentoriously laughing  and gaping with tehees of laughter' at unseasonable hours of night and  morning, haunted the purlieus of his abode.  His house fell under such a  load of infamy that no one dared to sleep in it, until municipal  improvement levelled the structure to the ground.  And my father has  often been told in the nursery how the devil's coach, drawn by six  coal-black horses with fiery eyes, would drive at night into the West  Bow, and belated people might see the dead Major through the glasses.    Another legend is that of the two maiden sisters.  A legend I am afraid  it may be, in the most discreditable meaning of the term; or perhaps  something worse--a mere yesterday's fiction.  But it is a story of some  vitality, and is worthy of a place in the Edinburgh kalendar.  This pair  inhabited a single room; from the facts, it must have been double-bedded;  and it may have been of some dimensions: but when all is said, it was a  single room.  Here our two spinsters fell out--on some point of  controversial divinity belike: but fell out so bitterly that there was  never a word spoken between them, black or white, from that day forward.  You would have thought they would separate: but no; whether from lack of  means, or the Scottish fear of scandal, they continued to keep house  together where they were.  A chalk line drawn upon the floor separated  their two domains; it bisected the doorway and the fireplace, so that  each could go out and in, and do her cooking, without violating the  territory of the other.  So, for years, they coexisted in a hateful  silence; their meals, their ablutions, their friendly visitors, exposed  to an unfriendly scrutiny; and at night, in the dark watches, each could  hear the breathing of her enemy.  Never did four walls look down upon an  uglier spectacle than these sisters rivalling in unsisterliness.  Here is  a canvas for Hawthorne to have turned into a cabinet picture--he had a  Puritanic vein, which would have fitted him to treat this Puritanic  horror; he could have shown them to us in their sicknesses and at their  hideous twin devotions, thumbing a pair of great Bibles, or praying aloud  for each other's penitence with marrowy emphasis; now each, with kilted  petticoat, at her own corner of the fire on some tempestuous evening; now  sitting each at her window, looking out upon the summer landscape sloping  far below them towards the firth, and the field-paths where they had  wandered hand in hand; or, as age and infirmity grew upon them and  prolonged their toilettes, and their hands began to tremble and their  heads to nod involuntarily, growing only the more steeled in enmity with  years; until one fine day, at a word, a look, a visit, or the approach of  death, their hearts would melt and the chalk boundary be overstepped for  ever.    Alas! to those who know the ecclesiastical history of the race--the most  perverse and melancholy in man's annals--this will seem only a figure of  much that is typical of Scotland and her high-seated capital above the  Forth--a figure so grimly realistic that it may pass with strangers for a  caricature.  We are wonderful patient haters for conscience sake up here  in the North.  I spoke, in the first of these papers, of the Parliaments  of the Established and Free Churches, and how they can hear each other  singing psalms across the street.  There is but a street between them in  space, but a shadow between them in principle; and yet there they sit,  enchanted, and in damnatory accents pray for each other's growth in  grace.  It would be well if there were no more than two; but the sects in  Scotland form a large family of sisters, and the chalk lines are thickly  drawn, and run through the midst of many private homes.  Edinburgh is a  city of churches, as though it were a place of pilgrimage.  You will see  four within a stone-cast at the head of the West Bow.  Some are crowded  to the doors; some are empty like monuments; and yet you will ever find  new ones in the building.  Hence that surprising clamour of church bells  that suddenly breaks out upon the Sabbath morning from Trinity and the  sea-skirts to Morningside on the borders of the hills.  I have heard the  chimes of Oxford playing their symphony in a golden autumn morning, and  beautiful it was to hear.  But in Edinburgh all manner of loud bells  join, or rather disjoin, in one swelling, brutal babblement of noise.  Now one overtakes another, and now lags behind it; now five or six all  strike on the pained tympanum at the same punctual instant of time, and  make together a dismal chord of discord; and now for a second all seem to  have conspired to hold their peace.  Indeed, there are not many uproars  in this world more dismal than that of the Sabbath bells in Edinburgh: a  harsh ecclesiastical tocsin; the outcry of incongruous orthodoxies,  calling on every separate conventicler to put up a protest, each in his  own synagogue, against 'right-hand extremes and left-hand defections.'  And surely there are few worse extremes than this extremity of zeal; and  few more deplorable defections than this disloyalty to Christian love.  Shakespeare wrote a comedy of 'Much Ado about Nothing.'  The Scottish  nation made a fantastic tragedy on the same subject.  And it is for the  success of this remarkable piece that these bells are sounded every  Sabbath morning on the hills above the Forth.  How many of them might  rest silent in the steeple, how many of these ugly churches might be  demolished and turned once more into useful building material, if people  who think almost exactly the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#5)"],[1,"are very voracious. The larvae of the  Staphylinidae are by no means unlike the perfect insect, and are found in  similar situations; their jaws are powerful, and their legs moderately  strong. The larvae of the Lamellicorn beetles (Figs. 1-6)--cockchafers,  stag-beetles, &c.--feed on vegetable substances or on dead animal  matter. They are long, soft, fleshy grubs, with the abdomen somewhat  curved, and generally lie on their side. The larvae of the Elateridae,  known as wireworms, are long and slender, with short legs. That of the  glowworm (Lampyridae) is not unlike the apterous female. The male  glowworm, on the contrary, is very different. It has long, thin, brown  wing-cases, and often flies into rooms at night, attracted by the light,  which it probably mistakes for that of its mate.    The metamorphoses of the Cantharidae are very remarkable, and will be  described subsequently. The larvae are active and hexapod. The Phytophaga  (_Crioceris_, _Galeruca_, _Haltica_, _Chrysomela_, &c.) are vegetable  feeders, both as larvae and in the perfect state. The larvae are furnished  with legs, and are not unlike the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera.    The larva of _Coccinella_ (the Ladybird) is somewhat depressed, of an  elongated ovate form, with a small head, and moderately strong legs. It  feeds on Aphides.    Thus, then, we see that there are among the Coleoptera many different  forms of larvae. Macleay considered that there were five principal types.    1. Carnivorous hexapod larvae, with an elongated, more or less flattened  body, six eyes on each side of the head, and sharp falciform mandibles  (_Carabus_, _Dyticus_, &c.).    2. Herbivorous hexapod larvae, with fleshy, cylindrical bodies, somewhat  curved, so that they lie on their side.    3. Apod grub-like larvae, with scarcely the rudiments of antennae  (_Curculio_).    4. Hexapod antenniferous larvae, with a subovate body, the second segment  being somewhat larger than the others (_Chrysomela_, _Coccinella_).    5. Hexapod antenniferous larvae, of oblong form, somewhat resembling the  former, but with caudal appendages (_Meloe_, _Sitaris_).    The pupa of the Coleoptera is quiescent, and \"the parts of the future  beetle are plainly perceivable, being encased in distinct sheaths; the  head is applied against the breast; the antennae lie along the sides of  the thorax; the elytra and wings are short and folded at the sides of  the body, meeting on the under side of the abdomen; the two anterior  pairs of legs are entirely exposed, but the hind pair are covered by  wing-cases, the extremity of the thigh only appearing beyond the sides  of the body.\"[9]    In the next three orders--namely, the Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts,  crickets, walking-stick insects, cockroaches, &c.), Euplexoptera  (earwigs), and Thysanoptera, a small group of insects well known to  gardeners under the name of _Thrips_ (Pl. I. and II., Figs. 1 and 2)--the  larvae when they quit the egg already much resemble the mature form,  differing, in fact, principally in the absence of wings, which are more  or less gradually acquired, as the insect increases in size. They are  active throughout life. Those specimens which have rudimentary wings  are, however, usually called pupae.    The Neuroptera present, perhaps, more differences in the character of  their metamorphoses than any other order of insects. Their larvae are  generally active, hexapod little creatures, and do not vary from one  another in appearance so much, for instance, as those of the Coleoptera,  but their pupae differ essentially; some groups, namely, the Psocidae,  Termitidae, Libellulidae, Ephemeridae, and Perlidae, remaining active  throughout life, like the Orthoptera; while a second division, including  the Myrmeleonidae, Hemerobiidae, Sialidae, Panorpidae, Raphidiidae, and  Mantispidae, have quiescent pupae, which, however, in some cases, acquire  more or less power of locomotion shortly before they assume the mature  state; thus that of _Raphidia_, though motionless at first, at length  acquires strength enough to walk, even while still enclosed in the pupa  skin, which is very thin.[10]    One of the most remarkable families belonging to this order is that of  the Termites, or white ants. They abound in the tropics, where they are  a perfect pest, and a serious impediment to human development. Their  colonies are extremely numerous, and they attack woodwork and furniture  of all kinds, generally working from within, so that their presence is  often unsuspected, until it is suddenly found that they have completely  eaten away the interior of some post or table, leaving nothing but a  thin outer shell. Their nests, which are made of earth, are sometimes  ten or twelve feet high, and strong enough to bear a man. One species,  _Termes lucifugus_, is found in the South of France, where it has been  carefully studied by Latreille. He found in these communities five kinds  of individuals--(1) males; (2) females, which grow to a very large size,  their bodies being distended with eggs, of which they sometimes lay as  many as 80,000 in a day; (3) a form described by some observers as Pupae,  but by others as neuters. These differ very much from the others, having  a long, soft body without wings, but with an immense head, and very  large, strong jaws. These individuals act as soldiers, doing apparently  no work, but keeping watch over the nest and attacking intruders with  great boldness. (4) Apterous, eyeless individuals, somewhat resembling  the winged ones, but with a larger and more rounded head; these  constitute the greater part of the community, and, like the workers of  ants and bees, perform all the labour, building the nest and collecting  food. (5) Latreille mentions another kind of individual which he regards  as the pupa, and which resembles the workers, but has four white  tubercles on the back, where the wings afterwards make their appearance.  There is still, however, much difference of opinion among entomologists,  with reference to the true nature of these different classes of  individuals. M. Lespes, who has recently studied the same species,  describes a second kind of male and a second kind of female, and the  subject, indeed, is one which offers a most promising field for future  study.    Another interesting family of Neuroptera is that of the Ephemerae, or  Mayflies (Pl. III., Fig. 1), so well known to fishermen. The larvae (Pl.  IV., Fig. 1) are semi-transparent, active, six-legged little creatures,  which live in water; having at first no gills, they respire through the  general surface of the body. They grow rapidly and change their skin  every few days. After one or two moults they acquire seven pairs of  branchiae, or gills, which are generally in the form of leaves, one pair  to the segment. When the larvae are about half grown, the posterior  angles of the two posterior thoracic segments begin to elongate. These  elongations become more and more marked with every change of skin. One  morning, in the month of June, some years ago, I observed a full-grown  larva, which had a glistening appearance, owing to the presence of a  film of air under the skin. I put it under the microscope, and, having  added a drop of water with a pipette, looked through the glass. To my  astonishment, the insect was gone, and an empty skin only remained. I  then caught a second specimen, in a similar condition, and put it under  the microscope, hoping to see it come out. Nor was I disappointed. Very  few moments had elapsed, when I had the satisfaction of seeing the  thorax open along the middle of the back; the two sides turned over; the  insect literally walked out of itself, unfolded its wings, and in an  instant flew up to the window. Several times since, I have had the  pleasure of witnessing this marvellous change, and it is really  wonderful how rapidly it takes place: from the moment when the skin  first cracks, not ten seconds are over before the insect has flown away.    Another family of Neuroptera, the Dragon-flies, or Horse-stingers, as  they are sometimes called, from a mistaken idea that they sting severely  enough to hurt a horse, though in fact they are quite harmless, also  spend their early days in the water. The larvae are brown, sluggish, ugly  creatures, with six legs. They feed on small water-animals, for which  they wait very patiently, either at the bottom of the water, or on some  aquatic plant. The lower jaws are attached to a long folding rod; and  when any unwary little creature approaches too near the larva, this  apparatus is shot out with such velocity that the prey which comes  within its reach seldom escapes. In their perfect condition, also,  Dragon-flies feed on other insects, and may often be seen hawking round  ponds. The so-called Ant-lions in many respects resemble the  Dragon-flies, but the habits of the larvae are very dissimilar. They do  not live in the water, but prefer dry places, where they bury themselves  in the loose sand, and seize with their long jaws any small insect which  may pass. The true Ant-lion makes itself a round, shallow pit in loose  ground or sand, and buries itself at the bottom. Any inattentive little  insect which steps over the edge of this pit immediately falls to the  bottom, and is instantaneously seized by the Ant-lion. Should the insect  escape, and attempt to climb up the side of the pit, the Ant-lion is  said to throw sand at it, knocking it down again.    One other family of Neuroptera which I must mention, is the  Hemerobiidae. The perfect insect is a beautiful, lace-winged, very  delicate, green creature, something like a tender Dragon-fly, and with  bright, green, touching eyes. The female deposits her eggs on leaves,  not directly on the plant itself, but attached to it by a long white  slender footstalk. The larva has six legs and powerful jaws, and makes  itself very useful in destroying the Hop-fly.    The insects forming"]]]
