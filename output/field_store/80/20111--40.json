Our animals were fed a measured amount of food daily, and they usually  ate most of what was provided. Occasionally these animals would eat  very little or none of their ration, and on some days they would eat  all that was given to them. We fed them either feline diet (ground  horse meat) or canned mackerel (Star-kist(R)[1]) along with  high-protein dog chow (Purina(R)). When available, fresh fruit also  was added to their diet. Water was always provided ad libitum.      [1] _The use of product brand names in this publication is        not intended as an endorsement of the products by the        Smithsonian Institution._    Measurements were conducted during the raccoons' daily inactive period  (sunrise to sunset) in both summer and winter. Oxygen consumption was  measured in a flow-through metabolism chamber at 5 deg.C intervals from  -10 deg.C to 35 deg.C. Animals were held at each temperature until the lowest  rate of oxygen consumption had been obtained and maintained for at  least 15 minutes. During each determination, oxygen consumption was  monitored for 30 minutes to one hour beyond a suspected minimum value  to see if an even lower reading could be obtained. Raccoons attained  minimum levels of oxygen consumption more quickly at warm (>10 deg.C) than  at cold temperatures. Depending on the temperature, therefore, each  measurement took from two to five hours to complete. On days when two  measurements could be completed, the second trial was always at a  temperature 10 deg.C warmer than the first.    The metabolism chamber was constructed from galvanized sheet metal  (77.5 x 45.5 x 51.0 cm = 180 liters) and was painted black inside.  Within the chamber, the animal was held in a cage (71 x 39 x 33 cm)  constructed from turkey wire that also was painted black. This cage  prevented the raccoons from coming into contact with the walls of the  chamber, yet it was large enough to allow them to stand and freely  move about. The bottom of the cage was 11 cm above the chamber floor,  which was covered to a depth of one cm with mineral oil to trap urine  and feces.    During measurements, the metabolism chamber was placed in a  controlled-temperature cabinet (modified Montgomery Ward model 8969  freezer). Air temperature (T_{a}) in the metabolism chamber was  regulated with a Yellow Springs Instrument model 74 temperature  controller. T_{a} was controlled to +-1.0 deg.C at temperatures below  freezing, and to +-0.5 deg.C at temperatures above freezing. The chamber  air and wall temperatures were recorded continuously (Linseis model  LS-64 recorder) during each experiment, and, except during temperature  changes, they were always within 0.5 deg.C of each other.    Columns of Drierite(R) and Ascarite(R) removed water vapor and carbon  dioxide, respectively, from air entering and leaving the chamber. Dry  carbon-dioxide-free room air was pumped into the chamber (Gilman model  13152 pressure/vacuum pump) at a rate of 3.0 L/min (Gilmont model  K3203-20 flow meter). Downstream from the chemical absorbents, an  aliquot (0.1 L/min) of dry carbon-dioxide-free air was drawn off the  chamber exhaust line and analyzed for oxygen content (Applied  Electrochemistry model S-3A oxygen analyzer, model 22M analysis cell,  and model R-1 flow control). All gas values were corrected to standard  temperature and pressure for dry gas. Oxygen consumption was  calculated from the difference in oxygen content between inlet and  outlet air using Eq. 8 of Depocas and Hart (1957).    Each raccoon was fasted for at least 12 hours before oxygen  consumption measurements began. At the start and end of each metabolic  trial the animal was weighed to the nearest 10 g (Doctors Infant  Scale, Detecto Scales, Inc., Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.A.). The body mass  used in calculating minimum oxygen consumption and evaporative water  loss was estimated from timed extrapolations of the difference between  starting and ending weights, and the time at which these variables  were measured.      _Evaporative Water Loss_    During metabolic measurements at temperatures above freezing,  evaporative water loss was determined gravimetrically. Upstream from  the chemical columns, an aliquot of air (0.1 L/min) was drawn off the  exhaust line and diverted for a timed interval through a series of  preweighed (0.1 mg) U-tubes containing Drierite(R). The aliquot then  passed through a second series of U-tubes containing Ascarite(R)  before entering the oxygen analysis system. Evaporative water loss was  calculated using Eq. 1     [.E] = (m_{w}.[.V]_{e})/([.V]_{a}.t.m)                         Eq. 1    where [.E] is evaporative water loss (mg.g^{-1}.h^{-1}), m_{w} is mass  of water collected (mg), [.V]_{e} is rate of air flow into the chamber  (3.0 L/min), [.V]_{a} is rate of air flow through the U-tubes  (0.1 L/min), t is length of the timed interval (h), and m is the  estimated mass of the raccoon at the time of sampling (g).      _Body Temperature_    Veterinarians at the National Zoological Park surgically implanted  calibrated temperature-sensitive radio transmitters (Telonics, Inc.,  Mesa, AZ, U.S.A.) into abdominal cavities of two female and two male  raccoons. Transmitter pulse periods were monitored with a digital  processor (Telonics TDP-2) coupled to a receiver (Telonics  TR-2-164/166). During some metabolic measurements, body temperatures  of these animals were recorded to the nearest 0.1 deg.C at 30-minute  intervals. The daily cycle of body temperature of these raccoons also  was measured once a month.        CALIBRATIONS      _Calorimeter_    At the conclusion of these experiments, the accuracy of our  calorimetry apparatus was tested by burning an ethanol lamp in the  metabolism chamber. During these tests a CO_{2} analyzer was  incorporated into the system (Beckman, LB-2). Results demonstrated  that we measured 84% of the oxygen consumed by the lamp as well as 84%  of the water and CO_{2} it produced; standard deviation = +-2.6, +-5.0,  and +-3.6, respectively (n = 27). Average respiratory quotient (RQ)  calculated from these data was O.657 +-0.008 (n = 27), which is 99.5%  of that predicted (0.66). McNab (1988b) reports that the accuracy of  open-flow indirect calorimetry systems, such as ours, depends on the  rate of air flow through the animal chamber. If flow rates are too  low, there is inadequate mixing of air within the chamber, and the  rate of oxygen consumption, as calculated from the difference in  oxygen content of air flowing into and out of the chamber (Depocas and  Hart, 1957), is underestimated. At some critical rate of air flow,  which is unique to each combination of chamber and animal, this  situation changes such that measured rates of oxygen consumption  become independent of any further increase in flow rate (McNab,  1988b). In recent tests of our system, where we burned the ethanol  lamp at a variety of chamber flow rates, the efficiency of  measurement increased linearly as flow rate increased, and the  critical rate of air flow was about 6.7 L/min. This appeared to  explain why a flow rate of 3.0 L/min underestimated oxygen consumption  of the ethanol lamp.    Our earlier tests of the efficiency of our system indicated that  although we underestimated actual oxygen consumption of the ethanol  lamp, we did so with a fair degree of precision; probably because flow  rates were closely controlled. During our metabolic measurements,  chamber flow rates also were closely controlled at 3.0 L/min, and we  believe, therefore, that these measurements also were carried out with  a high degree of precision. Consequently, all measured values of  oxygen consumption and water production were considered to be 84% of  their actual value and were adjusted to 100% before being included in  this report.      _Body Temperature Transmitters_    The calibration of all temperature-sensitive radio transmitters  drifted over time. Transmitters were calibrated before they were  surgically implanted and again after they were removed from the  animals. Although the drift of each transmitter was unique, it was  also linear (S. Tomkiewicz, Telonics, Inc., pers. com.). All body  temperature measurements were corrected from timed extrapolations of  the difference between starting and ending calibrations.        STATISTICAL METHODS      Values of oxygen consumption, evaporative water loss, and body  temperature were plotted as a function of chamber air temperature.  Linear regressions of oxygen consumption at temperatures below the  thermoneutral zone (T_{n}), and evaporative water loss at temperatures  above freezing, were determined with the SAS (1982) GLM procedure.  Lower critical temperature (T_{lc}) was determined graphically from  intersection of the line representing [.H]_{b} and the regression line  representing oxygen consumption below T_{n}. Slopes and intercepts of  regression lines, as well as other mean values, were compared with  _t_-tests (Statistical Analysis System, 1982; Ott, 1984:138-175).  Unless indicated otherwise, data are expressed as mean +- standard  deviation (s.d.).        ESTIMATING INTRINSIC RATE OF NATURAL INCREASE      We employed the method first described by Cole (1954) to calculate  r_{max}:     1 = e^{-r_{max}} + b.e^{-r_{max}(a)} - b.e^{r_{max}(n+1)}      Eq. 2    where a is potential age of females first producing young, b is  potential annual birth rate of female young, and n is potential age of  females producing their final young. After life-history data were  substituted into Eq. 2, r_{max} was determined by trial and error  substitution (Hennemann, 1983).    Because r_{max} represents the genetically fixed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36069"],[0,"Explorers and Travellers (#5)"],[1,"calumet upraised, while the  rest stood to arms, ready to fire on the first volley of the savages.  Marquette hailed them in Huron, and the party was not only peacefully  received, but invited to their village and presented with food of  various kinds. Joliet found among them guns, axes, hoes, powder, etc.,  and was assured that they bought cloth and other articles from Europeans  to the east, doubtless the Spaniards of Florida. Marquette was troubled  to find they had received no instruction in the faith, which, as far as  he could, he gave them.    Being assured that the sea was not more than ten days' journey distant,  they were greatly encouraged, and instead of drifting with the current,  took up their paddles with renewed ardor.    Passing beyond the prairie land, they found both sides of the river  lined with dense woods, wherein the cottonwood, elm, and white-wood were  of such height and size as to excite their admiration. That the forests  were not dense seemed evident from the bellowing of cattle behind the  fringe of trees, which were enlivened for our travellers by flocks of  quail along the water's edge and an occasional parrot with its brilliant  coloring of red, yellow, and green.    Nearing the mouth of the Arkansas, they saw on the river-bank an Indian  village called Mithiganea, near which Joliet and his party had an  exciting and fearful experience, which Marquette thus describes:    \"We heard from afar the Indians exciting one another to the combat by  continual yells. They were armed with bows, arrows, axes, war-clubs, and  bucklers, and prepared to attack us by land and water. Some embarked in  large wooden canoes, a part to ascend, the rest to descend, the river,  so as to cut our way and surround us completely. Those on shore kept  going and coming, as if about to begin the attack. In fact, some young  men sprang into the water to come and seize my canoe, but the current  having compelled them to return to the shore, one of them threw his war  club at us, but it passed over our heads without doing us any harm. In  vain I showed the calumet, and made gestures to explain that we had not  come as enemies. The alarm continued, and they were about to pierce us  from all sides with their arrows, when God suddenly touched the hearts  of the old men on the water side, doubtless at the sight of our calumet,  which at the distance they had not distinguished; but as I showed it  continually, they were touched, restrained the ardor of their youth, and  two of the chiefs, having thrown their bows and quivers into our canoe,  and as it were at our feet, entered and brought us to the shore, where  we disembarked, not without fear on our part.\"    An old chief was at last found who spoke a little Illinois, and through  him they were told that they could get full information regarding the  sea at another great village called Akamsea, about ten leagues down the  river. Presents were exchanged and the night passed among them with some  uneasiness. The loving missionary spirit of Marquette is shown here for,  he says: \"I know not whether they understood what I told them of God and  the things which concerned their salvation. It is a seed cast in the  earth which will bear its fruit in season.\"    At Akamsea (Arkansas) they were received by the sachem holding up a  peace calumet, after which they had the customary smoke and a repast of  different dishes made of Indian corn. Presents were interchanged and  speeches made through a young Indian who understood Illinois. The whole  day was spent in feasting, and the dishes of Indian corn were  continuously supplemented by pieces of dog flesh.    Joliet and Marquette learned from them that the sea was only ten days'  journey distant for the Indians, which meant five days for our explorers  in their birch canoes. They further set forth the very great danger of  passing on, owing to the continual war parties moving along the river. A  secret council of the sachems with a view to killing the party for  plunder was only broken up through the influence of the chief, who,  sending for the explorers, danced a calumet dance as a mark of perfect  assurance, and then to remove all fears, presented his peace calumet to  Marquette as a guarantee of safety.    The famous calumet dance is performed only on important occasions--to  strengthen peace, for a war assembly, at public rejoicings, and in honor  of important personages or invited strangers. The principal features  are, first, a dance; second, a mock combat; third, a self-laudatory  speech, during all of which the pipe plays an important part, being  smoked and handled to the measured cadence of voices and drums.    Joliet and Marquette now took counsel together as to whether they should  continue their voyage in face of such adverse conditions or turn back.  Finally, after long and careful consideration it was decided to return.    They realized that in their present latitude, 33 deg. 40' N., they could not  be more than two or three days from the sea, and that the Mississippi,  by its general course, undoubtedly flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, and  not into the South Sea through California.    Neglecting the dangers from warlike Indians along the lower river, they  considered, moreover, that they risked losing the fruit of this voyage  if they should throw themselves into the hands of the Spaniards, who  would at least imprison them.    [Illustration: De Soto.]    Joliet's farthest was on the east bank, opposite a river, probably the  Arkansas, and could not have been far from the point where De Soto more  than a hundred years before, in April, 1541, reached the Mississippi.  What a contrast between the means and experiences of these two  explorers! De Soto, a noble Spaniard, with an armament of ten vessels  equipped with all the paraphernalia of war, having, with three hundred  and fifty horsemen, a thousand picked men in mail who had been chosen  from the flower of the Spanish and Portuguese nobility. His followers  were animated by ambition, eager seekers for wealth and power, their  track marked by fire and sword, their action often treacherous and  always characterized by the savageness of their age. They reaped the  natural harvest, and although they reached the Mississippi, yet constant  warfare, continued privations, toil, and disasters had sadly wasted  their strength and numbers, and finally not one man in four ever reached  again a Spanish settlement. Joliet, an American of humble birth, with  two frail canoes equipped only with an ordinary hunting outfit, had six  followers who, inspired by neither hope of gold nor desire of conquest  other than that of a spiritual kind, came with peace and confidence,  were received by all tribes with hospitality, and returned to their own  without harm or contumely.    The result of De Soto's work was an unprofitable, soon-forgotten  discovery, utterly barren of results. Joliet reduced the fables of the  Indians to facts, discovered the muddy Missouri, and what is more, gave  definite knowledge to the world of the fertile valleys of the  Mississippi basin, wherein he planted the first germs of civilization,  which speedily took the practical form of missions and settlements.    After a day's rest, Joliet and his party left Akamsea July 17th, and  tediously retraced their course against the strong currents of the  Mississippi. Through the advice of the Indians they quitted the great  river at the mouth of the Illinois, which greatly shortened their way  and brought them with little trouble to the present site of Chicago,  they passing on the way through an Illinois town, Kaskaskia, of  seventy-four cabins, from which an escort of braves guided them to Lake  Michigan.    Marquette appears to have had a prophetic eye for the great future of  the present State of Illinois, for he says, \"We have seen nothing like  this river for the fertility of the land, its prairies, woods, wild  cattle, deer, wild-cats, bustards, swans, ducks, parrots, and even  beaver; its many little lakes and rivers.\"    Coasting the shores of Lake Michigan, the end of September, 1673,  brought them to Green Bay, where the rude comforts of a frontier mission  and the solace of friendly intercourse were once more theirs. They had  been absent four months, and in that time had paddled their frail canoes  more than twenty-five hundred miles. Here Marquette remained to recruit  his health, impaired by physical hardships, continued exposure, and lack  of suitable food. The hardy Joliet lost no time, however, but pressed  on, too eager to report his grand discoveries to Frontenac.    As mentioned in Frontenac's dispatch, the misfortunes of Joliet began  when his long and perilous voyage was practically ended. In the rapids  of La Chine, near Montreal, his canoe overset; three of his party were  drowned, all his papers lost, and he himself narrowly escaped. In a  letter to Frontenac he says: \"I had escaped every peril from the  Indians; I had passed forty-two rapids, and was on the point of  disembarking, full of joy at the success of so long and difficult an  enterprise, when my canoe capsized after all danger seemed past. I lost  two men, an Indian boy and my box of papers within sight of the first  French settlements, which I had left almost two years before. Nothing  now remains to me but my life and the ardent desire to employ it on any  service which you may be pleased to direct.\"    We have to rest content with the graphic account written by Marquette,  as it was impossible for Joliet to reproduce his lost journal. As  regards the map, his natural and acquired skill in cartography was such  that Joliet reproduced his discoveries in the shape of a small map,  which he presented to Frontenac, by whom it was sent to Colbert, with a  despatch dated November 14, 1674, and now is in the famous Chart Office  at Paris. It is entitled, \"Map of the Discovery of Sieur Joliet,\" etc.,  and has a brief"]]]
