The facts which precede are sufficient to convince us that the Roman  Republic[75] had already acquired under the kings a strong  organisation.[76] Its spirit of conquest overflowed beyond its narrow  limits. The small states of Latium which surrounded it possessed,  perhaps, men as enlightened and citizens equally courageous, but there  certainly did not exist among them, to the same degree as at Rome, the  genius of war, the love of country, faith in high destinies, the  conviction of an incontestible superiority, powerful motives of  activity, instilled into them perseveringly by great men during two  hundred and forty-four years.    Roman society was founded upon respect for family, for religion, and for  property; the government, upon election; the policy, upon conquest. At  the head of the State is a powerful aristocracy, greedy of glory, but,  like all aristocracies, impatient of kingly power, and disdainful  towards the multitude. The kings strive to create a people side by side  with the privileged caste, and introduce plebeians into the Senate,  freedmen among the citizens, and the mass of citizens into the ranks of  the soldiery.    Family is strongly constituted; the father reigns in it absolute master,  sole judge[77] over his children, his wife, and his slaves, and that  during all their lives: yet the wife's position is not degraded as among  the barbarians; she enjoys a community of goods with her husband;  mistress of her house, she has the right of acquiring property, and  shares equally with her brothers the paternal inheritance.[78]    The basis of taxation is the basis of recruiting and of political  rights; there are no soldiers but citizens; there are no citizens  without property. The richer a man is, the more he has of power and  dignities; but he has more charges to support, more duties to fulfil. In  fighting, as well as in voting, the Romans are divided into classes  according to their fortunes, and in the comitia, as on the field of  battle the richest are in the first ranks.    Initiated in the apparent practice of liberty, the people is held in  check by superstition and respect for the high classes. By appealing to  the intervention of the Divinity in every action of life, the most  vulgar things become idealised, and men are taught that above their  material interests there is a Providence which directs their actions.  The sentiment of right and justice enters into their conscience, the  oath is a sacred thing, and virtue, that highest expression of duty,  becomes the general rule of public and private life.[79] Law exercises  its entire empire, and, by the institution of the feciales,  international questions are discussed with a view to what is just,  before seeking a solution by force of arms. The policy of the State  consists in drawing by all means possible the peoples around under the  dependence of Rome; and, when their resistance renders it necessary to  conquer them,[80] they are, in different degrees, immediately associated  with the common fortune, and maintained in obedience by  colonies--advanced posts of future dominion.[81]    The arts, though as yet rude, find their way in with the Etruscan rites,  and come to soften manners, and lend their aid to religion; everywhere  temples arise, circuses are constructed,[82] great works of public  utility are erected, and Rome, by its institutions, paves the way for  its pre-eminence.    Almost all the magistrates are appointed by election; once chosen, they  possess an extensive power, and put in motion resolutely those two  powerful levers of human actions, punishment and reward. To all  citizens, for cowardice before the enemy or for an infraction of  discipline,[83] the rod or the axe of the lictor; to all, for noble  actions, crowns of honour;[84] to the generals, the ovation, the  triumph,[85] the best of the spoils;[86] to the great men, apotheosis.  To honour the dead, and for personal relaxation after their sanguinary  struggles, the citizens crowd to the games of the circus, where the  hierarchy gives his rank to each individual.[87]    Thus Rome, having reached the third century of her existence, finds her  constitution formed by the kings with all the germs of grandeur which  will develop themselves in the sequel. Man has created her institutions:  we shall see now how the institutions are going to form the men.          CHAPTER II    ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSULAR REPUBLIC.    (From 244 to 416.)      [Sidenote: Advantage of the Republic.]    1. The kings are expelled from Rome. They disappear because their  mission is accomplished. There exists, one would say, in moral as well  as physical order, a supreme law which assigns to institutions, as to  certain beings, a fated limit, marked by the term of their utility.  Until this providential term has arrived, no opposition prevails;  conspiracies, revolts, everything fails against the irresistible force  which maintains what people seek to overthrow; but if, on the contrary,  a state of things immovable in appearance ceases to be useful to the  progress of humanity, then neither the empire of traditions, nor  courage, nor the memory of a glorious past, can retard by a day the fall  which has been decided by destiny.    Civilisation appears to have been transported from Greece into Italy to  create there an immense focus from which it might spread itself over the  whole world. From that moment the genius of force and imagination must  necessarily preside over the first times of Rome. This is what happened  under the kings, and, so long as their task was not accomplished, it  triumphed over all obstacles. In vain the senators attempted to obtain  a share in the power by each exercising it for five days;[88] in vain  men's passions rebelled against the authority of a single chief: all was  useless, and even the murder of the kings only added strength to  royalty. But the moment once arrived when kings cease to be  indispensable, the simplest accident hurls them down. A man outrages a  woman, the throne gives way, and, in falling, it divides itself into  two: the consuls succeed to all the prerogatives of the kings.[89]  Nothing is changed in the Republic, except that instead of one chief,  elective for life, there will be henceforward two chiefs, elected for a  year. This transformation is evidently the work of the aristocracy; the  senators will possess the government, and, by these annual elections,  each hopes to take in his turn his share in the sovereign power. Such is  the narrow calculation of man and his mean motive of action. Let us see  what superior impulse he obeyed without knowing it.    That corner of land, situated on the bank of the Tiber, and predestined  to hold the empire of the world, enclosed within itself, as we see,  fruitful germs which demanded a rapid expansion. This could only be  effected by the absolute independence of the most enlightened class,  seizing for its own profit all the prerogatives of royalty. The  aristocratic government has this advantage over monarchy, that it is  more immutable in its duration, more constant in its designs, more  faithful to traditions, and that it can dare everything, because where a  great number share the responsibility, no one is individually  responsible. Rome, with its narrow limits, had no longer need of the  concentration of authority in a single hand, but it was in need of a new  order of things, which should give to the great free access to the  supreme power, and should second, by the allurement of honours, the  development of the faculties of each. The grand object was to create a  race of men of choice, who, succeeding each other with the same  principles and the same virtues, should perpetuate, from generation to  generation, the system most calculated to assure the greatness of their  country. The fall of the kingly power was thus an event favourable to  the development of Rome.    The patricians monopolised during a long time the civil, military, and  religious employments, and, these employments being for the most part  annual, there was in the Senate hardly a member who had not filled them;  so that this assembly was composed of men formed to the combats of the  Forum as well as to those of the field of battle, schooled in the  difficulties of the administration, and indeed worthy, by an experience  laboriously acquired, to preside over the destinies of the Republic.    They were not classed, as men are in our modern society, in envious and  rival specialities; the warrior was not seen there despising the  civilian, the lawyer or orator standing apart from the man of action, or  the priest isolating himself from all the others. In order to raise  himself to State dignities, and merit the suffrages of his  fellow-citizens, the patrician was constrained, from his youngest age,  to undergo the most varied trials. He was required to possess dexterity  of body, eloquence, aptness for military exercises, the knowledge of  civil and religious laws, the talent of commanding an army or directing  a fleet, of administrating the town or commanding a province; and the  obligation of these different apprenticeships not only gave a full  flight to all capacities, but it united, in the eyes of the people, upon  the magistrate invested with different dignities, the consideration  attached to each of them. During a long time, he who was honoured with  the confidence of his fellow-citizens, besides nobility of birth,  enjoyed the triple prestige given by the function of judge, priest, and  warrior.    An independence almost absolute in the exercise of command contributed  further to the development of the faculties. At the present day, our  constitutional habits have raised distrust towards power into a  principle; at Rome, trust was the principle. In our modern societies,  the depositary of any authority whatever is always under the restraint  of powerful bonds; he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#5)"],[1," Is he God?  Yes. Is he man? Yes--there is no escaping it. His resurrection and the  immortality of his body as well as of his spirit that succeeds his  resurrection is a reality. He himself attested it in various ways. He  appeared to a number of the apostles, who, when they saw him, were  seized with fright, supposing they had seen a spirit; but he said unto  them, \"Why are ye troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see;  for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[A] Then,  in further attestation of the reality of his existence, as if to put  away all doubt, he said, \"Have ye here any meat?\" And they brought him  some broiled fish and honeycomb, and \"he did eat before them.\" Think of  it! A resurrected, immortal person actually eating of material food! I  wonder that our spiritually-minded friends do not arraign him for such  a material act as that after his resurrection! A Scotch Presbyterian  is particularly zealous for a strict observance of the Sabbath. One  who was a little liberal in his views of the law pertaining to the  Sabbath was once arguing with an orthodox brother on the subject, and  urged that even Jesus so far bent the law pertaining to the Sabbath  that he justified his disciples in walking through the fields of corn  on the Sabbath, and rubbing the ears of corn in their hands, blowing  away the chaff, and eating the corn. \"O weel,\" says Donald, \"mebbe  the Lord did that; but it doesna heighten him in my opeenion.\" And so  this resurrected, second personage of the Godhead ate material food  after his resurrection; but I take it that the fact does not \"heighten\"  him in the opinion of our ultra spiritually-minded folk. It comes in  conflict, undoubtedly, with their notions of what life ought to be  after the resurrection.    [Footnote A: Luke 24:36-39.]    [Footnote B: Luke 24:41-43.]    But not only did he do this, but with his resurrected hands he  prepared a meal on the sea shore for his own disciples, and invited  them to partake of the food which he with his resurrected hands had  provided.[A] Moreover, for forty days he continued ministering to his  disciples after his resurrection, eating and drinking with them;[B] and  then, as they gathered together on one occasion, lo! he ascended from  their midst, and a cloud received him out of their sight. Presently  two personages in white apparel stood beside them and said: \"Ye men of  Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which  is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye  have seen him go into heaven.\"[C] What! With his body of flesh and  bones, with the marks in his hands and in his feet? Shall he come  again in that form? The old Jewish prophet, Zechariah, foresaw that  he would. He describes the time of his glorious coming, when his  blessed, nail-pierced feet shall touch the Mount of Olives again, and  it shall cleave in twain, and open a great valley for the escape of the  distressed house of Judah, sore oppressed in the siege of their great  city Jerusalem. We are told that \"They shall look upon him whom they  have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only  son,\" and one shall look upon him in that day and shall say, \"What are  these wounds in thy hands and in thy feet?\" and he shall answer, \"These  are the wounds that I received in the house of my friends.\"[D]    [Footnote A: John 21:9-13 and Acts 10:41.]    [Footnote B: Acts 10:31, and Acts 1:2,3.]    [Footnote C: Acts 1:11.]    [Footnote D: Zech. the 12th, 13th, and 14th chapters.]    What think ye of Christ? Is he God? Yes. Is he man? Yes, Will that  resurrected, immortal, glorified man ever be distilled into some  bodiless, formless essence, to be diffused as the perfume of a rose  is diffused throughout the circumambient air? Will he become an  impersonal, incorporeal, immaterial God, without body, without parts,  without passions? Will it be? Can it be? What think ye of Christ?  Is he God? Yes. Is he an exalted man? Yes; in the name of all the  Gods, he is. Then why do sectarian ministers arraign the faith of the  members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because  they believe and affirm that God is an exalted man, and that he has a  body, tangible, immortal, indestructible, and will so remain embodied  throughout the countless ages of eternity? And since the Son is in the  form and likeness of the Father, being, as Paul tells, \"in the express  image of his [the Father's] person\"--so, too, the Father God is a man  of immortal tabernacle, glorified and exalted: for as the Son is, so  also is the Father, a personage of tabernacle, of flesh and of bone as  tangible as man's, as tangible as Christ's most glorious, resurrected  body.    II.    THE ONENESS OF GOD.    There are some expressions of scripture to consider which speak of the  \"oneness\" of God. Speaking of the question which agitated the early  Christian Church about eating meats which had been offered to idols,  Paul says: \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that  there is none other God but one.\"[A] Moreover, Jesus himself made this  strange remark--that is, strange until one understands it: \"I and my  Father are one;\" and so much one are they that he said: \"He that hath  seen me hath seen the Father. * * * Believest thou not that I am in  the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I  speak not of myself; but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the  works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.\"[B]  Consequently our philosophers, especially those who lived when the  present Christian creeds concerning God were forming, thought that by  some legerdemain or other they must make the three Gods--the Father,  the Son, and the Holy Ghost--just one person--one being; and therefore  they set their wits at work to perform the operation.    [Footnote A: I Cor. 8:4.]    [Footnote B: John 14.]    Let us seek out some reasonable explanation of the language used. I  refer again to the passage I just quoted from the writings of Paul  with reference to there being \"none other God but one.\" Immediately  following what I read on that point comes this language:          For though there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in      earth (as there be Gods many, and Lords many). But to us there is      but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and      one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.[A]    [Footnote A: I Cor. 8:4-6.]    Now I begin to understand. \"To us,\" that is, _pertaining_ to us, \"there  is but one God.\" Just as to the English subject there is but one  sovereign, so \"to us\" there is but one God. But that no more denies  the existence of other Gods than the fact that to the Englishman there  is but one sovereign denies the existence of other rulers over other  lands. While declaring that \"to us there is but one God,\" the passage  also plainly says that there \"be Gods many and Lords many,\" and it is a  mere assumption of the sectarian ministers that reference is made only  to heathen gods.    Again, we shall find help in the following passage in the 14th chapter  of John:          At that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me,      and I in you.    Observe this last scripture, I pray you. \"I in you,\" and \"ye in me,\"  as well as Jesus being in the Father. This oneness existing between  God the Father and God the Son can amount to nothing more than this:  that Jesus was conscious of the indwelling presence of the Spirit of  the Father within him, hence he spoke of himself and his Father as  being one, and the Father within him doing the works. But mark you, not  only are the disciples to know that the Father is in him, that is, in  Christ, and that Jesus is in the Father, but the disciples also are to  be in Jesus. In what way? Jesus himself has furnished the explanation.  When the solemn hour of his trial drew near, and the bitter cup was to  be drained to the very dregs, Jesus sought God in secret prayer, and in  the course of that prayer he asked for strength of the Father, not only  for himself, but for his disciples also. He said:          And now I am no more in the world, but these [referring to his      disciples] are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep      through thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be      one, _as we are_.[A]    [Footnote A: John 17.]    Now I begin to see this mystery of \"oneness.\" What does he mean when he  prays that the disciples that God had given him should be one, as he  and the Father are one? Think of it a moment, and while you are doing  so I will read you this:          Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall      believe on me through their word; that they all may be one: as      thou, _Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one      in us._[A]    [Footnote A: John 17.]    Does that mean that the persons of all these disciples, whose  resurrection and individual immortality he must have foreknown, shall  all be merged into one person, and then that one fused into him, or he  into that one, and then the Father consolidated into the oneness of the  mass? No; a thousand times, no, to such a proposition as that. But as  Jesus found the indwelling Spirit of God within himself, so he would  have that same Spirit indwelling in his disciples, as well as in those  who should believe on him through their testimony, in all time to come;  and in this way become of one mind, actuated by one will. It must have  been thoughts such as these that prompted Paul to say to the Ephesians:          For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus      Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,      that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to      be strengthened with might"]]]
