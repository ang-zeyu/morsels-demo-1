In this way the person exercising volition adds the  feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful  \"underwills\" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social structure  composed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET  C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed  and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies  itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is  absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as  already said, of a social structure composed of many \"souls\", on which  account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such  within the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations  of supremacy under which the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests itself.    20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or  autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with  each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear  in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to  a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent--is  betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most  diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme  of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve  once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they  may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something  within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the  one after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship  of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a  re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off,  ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly  grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.  The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German  philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is  affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I mean  owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical  functions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset  for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems,  just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of  world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the  domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject  is least developed) look otherwise \"into the world,\" and will be  found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and  Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately  also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--So  much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the  origin of ideas.    21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been  conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the  extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and  frightfully with this very folly. The desire for \"freedom of will\"  in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway,  unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear  the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and  to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom,  involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with  more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the  hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in  this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of \"free  will\" and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry  his \"enlightenment\" a step further, and also put out of his head the  contrary of this monstrous conception of \"free will\": I mean \"non-free  will,\" which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One  should not wrongly MATERIALISE \"cause\" and \"effect,\" as the natural  philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at  present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes  the cause press and push until it \"effects\" its end; one should use  \"cause\" and \"effect\" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as  conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual  understanding,--NOT for explanation. In \"being-in-itself\" there is  nothing of \"casual-connection,\" of \"necessity,\" or of \"psychological  non-freedom\"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there \"law\"  does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,  reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive,  and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world,  as \"being-in-itself,\" with things, we act once more as we have always  acted--MYTHOLOGICALLY. The \"non-free will\" is mythology; in real life  it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost always  a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every  \"causal-connection\" and \"psychological necessity,\" manifests something  of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom;  it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. And  in general, if I have observed correctly, the \"non-freedom of the will\"  is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but  always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their  \"responsibility,\" their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to  THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others  on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed  for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF  THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are  in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of  socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of  fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly  when it can pose as \"la religion de la souffrance humaine\"; that is ITS  \"good taste.\"    22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from  the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but  \"Nature's conformity to law,\" of which you physicists talk so proudly,  as though--why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad  \"philology.\" It is no matter of fact, no \"text,\" but rather just a  naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which  you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern  soul! \"Everywhere equality before the law--Nature is not different in  that respect, nor better than we\": a fine instance of secret motive,  in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and  autocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once more  disguised. \"Ni dieu, ni maitre\"--that, also, is what you want; and  therefore \"Cheers for natural law!\"--is it not so? But, as has been  said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along,  who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read  out of the same \"Nature,\" and with regard to the same phenomena, just  the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims  of power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and  unconditionalness of all \"Will to Power\" before your eyes, that almost  every word, and the word \"tyranny\" itself, would eventually seem  unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being too  human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about  this world as you do, namely, that it has a \"necessary\" and \"calculable\"  course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are  absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences  every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation--and you  will be eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.    23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and  timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far  as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written,  evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if  nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology  and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it.  The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most  intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and  unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive,  blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to  contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator,  it has \"the heart\" against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal  conditionalness of the \"good\" and the \"bad\" impulses, causes (as  refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U.

Most of my time was spent among my old  school-mates--these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point.    Persons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets is  divided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises.  These companies are officered from the cadets, the superintendent and  commandant selecting the officers for their military bearing and  qualifications.  The adjutant, quartermaster, four captains and twelve  lieutenants are taken from the first, or Senior class; the sergeants  from the second, or junior class; and the corporals from the third, or  Sophomore class.  I had not been \"called out\" as a corporal, but when I  returned from furlough I found myself the last but one--about my  standing in all the tactics--of eighteen sergeants.  The promotion was  too much for me.  That year my standing in the class--as shown by the  number of demerits of the year--was about the same as it was among the  sergeants, and I was dropped, and served the fourth year as a private.    During my first year's encampment General Scott visited West Point, and  reviewed the cadets.  With his commanding figure, his quite colossal  size and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood my  eyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied.  I could never resemble  him in appearance, but I believe I did have a presentiment for a moment  that some day I should occupy his place on review--although I had no  intention then of remaining in the army.  My experience in a horse-trade  ten years before, and the ridicule it caused me, were too fresh in my  mind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimate  chum.  The next summer Martin Van Buren, then President of the United  States, visited West Point and reviewed the cadets; he did not impress  me with the awe which Scott had inspired.  In fact I regarded General  Scott and Captain C. F. Smith, the Commandant of Cadets, as the two men  most to be envied in the nation.  I retained a high regard for both up  to the day of their death.    The last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two, but they  still seemed about five times as long as Ohio years, to me.  At last all  the examinations were passed, and the members of the class were called  upon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments.  I was  anxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called, but  there was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time, and  attached to that, besides the full complement of officers, there were at  least four brevet second lieutenants.  I recorded therefore my first  choice, dragoons; second, 4th infantry; and got the latter.  Again there  was a furlough--or, more properly speaking, leave of absence for the  class were now commissioned officers--this time to the end of September.  Again I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school-mates; and  again I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use, besides  a horse and buggy that I could drive--but I was not in a physical  condition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion.  For  six months before graduation I had had a desperate cough (\"Tyler's grip\"  it was called), and I was very much reduced, weighing but one hundred  and seventeen pounds, just my weight at entrance, though I had grown six  inches in stature in the mean time.  There was consumption in my  father's family, two of his brothers having died of that disease, which  made my symptoms more alarming.  The brother and sister next younger  than myself died, during the rebellion, of the same disease, and I  seemed the most promising subject for it of the three in 1843.    Having made alternate choice of two different arms of service with  different uniforms, I could not get a uniform suit until notified of my  assignment.  I left my measurement with a tailor, with directions not to  make the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantry  or dragoons.  Notice did not reach me for several weeks, and then it  took at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor and  two more to make the clothes and have them sent to me.  This was a time  of great suspense.  I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how it  looked, and probably wanted my old school-mates, particularly the girls,  to see me in it.    The conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances that  happened soon after the arrival of the clothes, which gave me a distaste  for military uniform that I never recovered from.  Soon after the  arrival of the suit I donned it, and put off for Cincinnati on  horseback.  While I was riding along a street of that city, imagining  that every one was looking at me, with a feeling akin to mine when I  first saw General Scott, a little urchin, bareheaded, footed, with dirty  and ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows--that's what  suspenders were called then--and a shirt that had not seen a wash-tub  for weeks, turned to me and cried:  \"Soldier! will you work?  No,  sir--ee; I'll sell my shirt first!!\" The horse trade and its dire  consequences were recalled to mind.    The other circumstance occurred at home.  Opposite our house in Bethel  stood the old stage tavern where \"man and beast\" found accommodation,  The stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor.  On  my return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable,  barefooted, but in a pair of sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the color  of my uniform trousers--with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed down  the outside seams in imitation of mine.  The joke was a huge one in the  mind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did not  appreciate it so highly.    During the remainder of my leave of absence, my time was spent in  visiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati, and occasionally other  towns in that part of the State.        CHAPTER III.    ARMY LIFE--CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR--CAMP SALUBRITY.    On the 30th of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St.  Louis, with the 4th United States infantry.  It was the largest military  post in the country at that time, being garrisoned by sixteen companies  of infantry, eight of the 3d regiment, the remainder of the 4th.  Colonel Steven Kearney, one of the ablest officers of the day, commanded  the post, and under him discipline was kept at a high standard, but  without vexatious rules or regulations.  Every drill and roll-call had  to be attended, but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoy  themselves, leaving the garrison, and going where they pleased, without  making written application to state where they were going for how long,  etc., so that they were back for their next duty.  It did seem to me, in  my early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they came  to command posts, made it a study to think what orders they could  publish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.  I  noticed, however, a few years later, when the Mexican war broke out,  that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed of  disabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service.  They had the moral courage to proclaim it, too.  They were right; but  they did not always give their disease the right name.    At West Point I had a class-mate--in the last year of our studies he was  room-mate also--F. T. Dent, whose family resided some five miles west of  Jefferson Barracks.  Two of his unmarried brothers were living at home  at that time, and as I had taken with me from Ohio, my horse, saddle and  bridle, I soon found my way out to White Haven, the name of the Dent  estate.  As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent.  There were at home, besides the young men, two daughters, one a school  miss of fifteen, the other a girl of eight or nine.  There was still an  older daughter of seventeen, who had been spending several years at  boarding-school in St. Louis, but who, though through school, had not  yet returned home.  She was spending the winter in the city with  connections, the family of Colonel John O'Fallon, well known in St.  Louis.  In February she returned to her country home.  After that I do  not know but my visits became more frequent; they certainly did become  more enjoyable.  We would often take walks, or go on horseback to visit  the neighbors, until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity.  Sometimes one of the brothers would accompany us, sometimes one of the  younger sisters.  If the 4th infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracks  it is possible, even probable, that this life might have continued for  some years without my finding out that there was anything serious the  matter with me; but in the following May a circumstance occurred which  developed my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it.    The annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violent  discussion in Congress, in the press, and by individuals.  The  administration of President Tyler, then in power, was making the most  strenuous efforts to effect the annexation, which was, indeed, the great  and absorbing question of the day.  During these discussions the greater  part of the single rifle regiment in the army--the 2d dragoons, which  had been dismounted a year or two before, and designated \"Dismounted  Rifles\"--was stationed at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, some twenty-five miles  east of the Texas line, to observe the frontier.  About the 1st of May  the 3d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana, to go  into camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup, and there await further  orders.  The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way down  the Mississippi "]]]
