So I must always think of it, dark, tragic, and superb. The  Egyptians once believed that when death came to a man, the soul of him,  which they called the Ba, winged its way to the gods, but that, moved  by a sweet unselfishness, it returned sometimes to his tomb, to give  comfort to the poor, deserted mummy. Upon the lids of sarcophagi it is  sometimes represented as a bird, flying down to, or resting upon, the  mummy. As I went onward in the darkness, among the columns, over the  blocks of stone that form the pavements, seeing vaguely the sacred boats  upon the walls, Horus and Thoth, the king before Osiris; as I mounted  and descended with the priests to roof and floor, I longed, instead of  the clamour of the bats, to hear the light flutter of the soft wings of  the Ba of Hathor, flying from Paradise to this sad temple of the desert  to bring her comfort in the gloom. I thought of her as a poor woman,  suffering as only women can in loneliness.    In the museum of Cairo there is the mummy of \"the lady Amanit, priestess  of Hathor.\" She lies there upon her back, with her thin body slightly  turned toward the left side, as if in an effort to change her position.  Her head is completely turned to the same side. Her mouth is wide open,  showing all the teeth. The tongue is lolling out. Upon the head the  thin, brown hair makes a line above the little ear, and is mingled at  the back of the head with false tresses. Round the neck is a mass of  ornaments, of amulets and beads. The right arm and hand lie along the  body. The expression of \"the lady Amanit\" is very strange, and very  subtle; for it combines horror--which implies activity--with a profound,  an impenetrable repose, far beyond the reach of all disturbance. In the  temple of Denderah I fancied the lady Amanit ministering sadly, even  terribly, to a lonely goddess, moving in fear through an eternal gloom,  dying at last there, overwhelmed by tasks too heavy for that tiny body,  the ultra-sensitive spirit that inhabited it. And now she sleeps--one  feels that, as one gazes at the mummy--very profoundly, though not yet  very calmly, the lady Amanit. But her goddess--still she wakes upon her  column.    When I came out at last into the sunlight of the growing day, I circled  the temple, skirting its gigantic, corniced walls, from which at  intervals the heads and paws of resting lions protrude, to see another  woman whose fame for loveliness and seduction is almost as legendary as  Aphrodite's. It is fitting enough that Cleopatra's form should be graven  upon the temple of Hathor; fitting, also, that though I found her in the  presence of deities, and in the company of her son, Caesarion, her face,  which is in profile, should have nothing of Hathor's sad impressiveness.  This, no doubt, is not the real Cleopatra. Nevertheless, this face  suggests a certain self-complacent cruelty and sensuality essentially  human, and utterly detached from all divinity, whereas in the face  of the goddess there is a something remote, and even distantly  intellectual, which calls the imagination to \"the fields beyond.\"    As I rode back toward the river, I saw again the boy clad in the rope of  plaited grass, and again he said, less shyly, \"May your day be happy!\"  It was a kindly wish. In the dawn I had felt it to be almost a prophecy.  But now I was haunted by the face of the goddess of Denderah, and I  remembered the legend of the lovely Lais, who, when she began to age,  covered herself from the eyes of men with a veil, and went every day at  evening to look upon her statue, in which the genius of Praxiteles had  rendered permanent the beauty the woman could not keep. One evening,  hanging to the statue's pedestal by a garland of red roses, the sculptor  found a mirror, upon the polished disk of which were traced these words:    \"Lais, O Goddess, consecrates to thee her mirror: no longer able to see  there what she was, she will not see there what she has become.\"    My Hathor of Denderah, the sad-eyed dweller on the column in the first  hall, had she a mirror, would surely hang it, as Lais hung hers, at the  foot of the pedestal of the Egyptian Aphrodite; had she a veil, would  surely cover the face that, solitary among the cruel evidences of  Christian ferocity, silently says to the gloomy courts, to the shining  desert and the Nile:    \"Once I was worshipped, but I am worshipped no longer.\"          VII    KARNAK    Buildings have personalities. Some fascinate as beautiful women  fascinate; some charm as a child may charm, naively, simply, but  irresistibly. Some, like conquerors, men of blood and iron, without  bowels of mercy, pitiless and determined, strike awe to the soul,  mingled with the almost gasping admiration that power wakes in man. Some  bring a sense of heavenly peace to the heart. Some, like certain temples  of the Greeks, by their immense dignity, speak to the nature almost as  music speaks, and change anxiety to trust. Some tug at the hidden chords  of romance and rouse a trembling response. Some seem to be mingling  their tears with the tears of the dead; some their laughter with the  laughter of the living. The traveller, sailing up the Nile, holds  intercourse with many of these different personalities. He is sad,  perhaps, as I was with Denderah; dreams in the sun with Abydos; muses  with Luxor beneath the little tapering minaret whence the call to prayer  drops down to be answered by the angelus bell; falls into a reverie in  the \"thinking place\" of Rameses II., near to the giant that was once the  mightiest of all Egyptian statues; eagerly wakes to the fascination of  record at Deir-el-Bahari; worships in Edfu; by Philae is carried into a  realm of delicate magic, where engineers are not. Each prompts him to  a different mood, each wakes in his nature a different response. And at  Karnak what is he? What mood enfolds him there? Is he sad, thoughtful,  awed, or gay?    An old lady in a helmet, and other things considered no doubt by her as  suited to Egypt rather than to herself, remarked in my hearing, with  a Scotch accent and an air of summing up, that Karnak was \"very nice  indeed.\" There she was wrong--Scotch and wrong. Karnak is not nice. No  temple that I have seen upon the banks of the Nile is nice. And Karnak  cannot be summed up in a phrase or in many phrases; cannot even be  adequately described in few or many words.    Long ago I saw it lighted up with colored fires one night for the  Khedive, its ravaged magnificence tinted with rose and livid green and  blue, its pylons glittering with artificial gold, its population of  statues, its obelisks, and columns, changing from things of dreams to  things of day, from twilight marvels to shadowy specters, and from these  to hard and piercing realities at the cruel will of pigmies crouching  by its walls. Now, after many years, I saw it first quietly by moonlight  after watching the sunset from the summit of the great pylon. That was a  pageant worth more than the Khedive's.    I was in the air; had something of the released feeling I have often  known upon the tower of Biskra, looking out toward evening to the Sahara  spaces. But here I was not confronted with an immensity of nature, but  with a gleaming river and an immensity of man. Beneath me was the native  village, in the heart of daylight dusty and unkempt, but now becoming  charged with velvety beauty, with the soft and heavy mystery that at  evening is born among great palm-trees. Along the path that led from  it, coming toward the avenue of sphinxes with ram's-heads that watch for  ever before the temple door, a great white camel stepped, its rider a  tiny child with a close, white cap upon his head. The child was singing  to the glory of the sunset, or was it to the glory of Amun, \"the hidden  one,\" once the local god of Thebes, to whom the grandest temple in  the world was dedicated? I listen to the childish, quavering voice,  twittering almost like a bird, and one word alone came up to me--the  word one hears in Egypt from all the lips that speak and sing: from the  Nubians round their fires at night, from the little boatmen of the lower  reaches of the Nile, from the Bedouins of the desert, and the donkey  boys of the villages, from the sheikh who reads one's future in water  spilt on a plate, and the Bisharin with buttered curls who runs to sell  one beads from his tent among the sand-dunes.    \"Allah!\" the child was singing as he passed upon his way.    Pigeons circled above their pretty towers. The bats came out, as if they  knew how precious is their black at evening against the ethereal lemon  color, the orange and the red. The little obelisk beyond the last  sphinx on the left began to change, as in Egypt all things change at  sunset--pylon and dusty bush, colossus and baked earth hovel, sycamore,  and tamarisk, statue and trotting donkey. It looked like a mysterious  finger pointed in warning toward the sky. The Nile began to gleam. Upon  its steel and silver torches of amber flame were lighted. The Libyan  mountains became spectral beyond the tombs of the kings. The tiny, rough  cupolas that mark a grave close to the sphinxes, in daytime dingy and  poor, now seemed made of some splendid material worthy to roof the mummy  of a king. Far off a pool of the Nile, that from here looked like a  little palm-fringed lake, turned ruby-red. The flags from the standard  of Luxor, among the minarets, flew out straight against a sky that was  pale as a primrose almost cold in its amazing delicacy.    I turned, and behind me the moon was risen. Already its silver rays  fell upon the ruins of Karnak; upon the thickets of lotus columns; upon  solitary gateways that now give entrance to no courts; upon the sacred  lake, with its reeds, where the black water-fowl were asleep; upon  sloping walls, shored up by enormous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34076"],[0,"Fox Trapping: A Book of Instruction Telling How to Trap, Snare, Poison and Shoot (#5)"],[1," in some grapevines and was waiting for me.    Now I think there are instances where the scent of steel or human  scent will scare animals away from your sets, and when you mix them  both together they are a sure warning of danger with all shy animals.  Now if this fox did not locate that trap at set No. 3 with her nose I  would like to know how she did it, for I removed every bit of dirt I  took out to make set and left all level and two and a half inches of  snow ought to make things look as natural as any fox could expect to  find a set, and at a rock where she had been in the habit of seeing  things torn up by the dogs when she came out on previous occasions,  and traps hidden out of sight, her nose surely told her where they  were set.        CHAPTER VIII.    TRAPPING RED FOX.    In the many years that he has been striving for his glossy pelt, man  has evolved numerous clever schemes for outwitting the fox, but in  the meantime Reynard has not been an idle observer regarding the ways  of the human enemy, says J. L. Woodbury, of Maine. He lacks the  advantage of books or tradition for handing down his store of  accumulated knowledge, but in some mysterious way it is transmitted  from generation to generation, nevertheless. So it is that the fox of  the older and more thickly settled sections is a very different  animal from the fox--even though it be of the same variety or  species--inhabiting a part of the country where its kind has not been  so persistently hunted. Tricks that prove effective with the latter  are utterly lost on his better-schooled brother. Hence the simple  methods advanced by some trappers are a bit amusing to the trappers  here in the East, where the subject of this sketch reaches the acme  of wisdom, and is, we believe, the peer in shrewdness and cunning of  any animal in the world. However, we do not wish to be understood as  ridiculing anybody's methods. We read the crudest of them with  interest, realizing that they are all right in the region whence they  came.      [Illustration: CAUGHT IN MAINE.]    I would advise the amateur fox trapper to begin with the water set if  practicable. Nearly any one of the many different forms are good  enough, with such modifications as will be found necessary to adapt  it to varying conditions of different sets. As one should not begin  operations until freezing weather, spring water should be selected  for the trap. A good-sized spring works best, but if this is not to  be had, utilize some of the little springs to be found in plenty near  the sources of brooks. One with a dark bottom is to be preferred, as  then there will be no sand to clog the trap, which may be pressed  down into the mud until it is all hidden but the pan. This should be  about an inch under the water, and covered with a lump of moss.    The position of trap with relation to bait has so often been  explained I need not dwell upon it here. If the spring be a large one  it is easy to place the bait so that it will be protected by water on  all sides save the one desired, but if a smaller pool be employed the  side opposite the trap should be barricaded with stumps or brush;  which work, by the way, had better be done some time during the  previous summer. And rather than leave too narrow an approach to the  bait if is better to set two or even more traps, for reynard's  suspicions are quickly aroused by anything resembling an inclosure.    As to the matter of bait, it may be said in general that foxes like  about all kinds of meat. Yet the task of selecting a killing bait is  not always as easy as might be expected from this, as individuals  seem to have their particular preferences, while the morsel that  would be eagerly sought by the same fox at one season will have no  attraction for him at another. If you find \"signs\" in the vicinity of  your sets, yet they remain unmolested, experiment with different  kinds of baits, as the angler tries a variety of flies at every  likely-looking pool. It is certain that mice, rabbits and grouse are  among the best baits.    For the \"scent\" part, some trappers claim to do well without them,  but a good scent is unquestionably a great help. Many of those for  which receipts are given I know to be effective. But the most  tempting bait and the strongest lure will jointly prove unavailing if  one's set be unskillfully made, and carelessness be practiced in  going to and from trap.    Water, of course, leaves no scent where it is possible to reach the  set by boat or wading, but where this is impracticable arrange to go  to trap but rarely, if it remain undisturbed. The height of springs  vary but little with wet or dry weather, and this fact should be  taken full advantage of by the fox-trapper. Carefully select a trap  that will not spring of itself. See that the trigger is pushed well  into the notch, pick out a good, close-fibred piece of moss for pan,  not large enough to clog the jaws, and stick a few small twigs around  it to hold it in place. Push the chain well down into the mud, have  the bait exactly in the right place, and in fact use every care to  have things fixed so that they will not be disarranged by trivial  causes. Then in visiting, go no nearer than is necessary to see that  bait or trap have not been disturbed.    Skunks will often prove a great bother, as they take all kinds of  bait and kick up no end of a \"bobbery\" when caught. The fact that  their pelts pay the bill in part is but poor consolation, when one  has just got a particularly shy old red coat about worked up to the  \"biting\" point.    Sometimes one will run upon natural conditions particularly favorable  for a set--a rock, islet or piece of drift in mid-channel, or an old  log spanning the stream. Experienced trappers are quick to note all  such places as these, as well as points where, with a very little  human handiwork, traps may be placed to advantage.    It is best to make all essential preparations as long before setting  as possible, though bearing in mind that the streams are usually much  higher in the trapping season than during the summer. Also begin  putting out baits some time before setting traps. No animal exercises  afterward the same degree of caution as on the first two or three  visits to a spot, and even so shy a creature as the fox, if he become  accustomed to picking up a few choice bits at a place, will soon  neglect much of his usual precaution in approaching it, and though he  take alarm and shun it for a time will ere long get up sufficient  confidence to renew his visits.    If you find where there is a burrow with a family of young foxes,  watch them all you can during your leisure moments. Learn where they  get their food, where they cross the streams, and their general lines  of travel. True, the family may be broken up and driven to sections  miles away before time for trapping, but nevertheless a few traps  should be placed in the old beats, as if one of this family should  ever return to the vicinity he will be certain to revisit his former  haunts.    Many trappers, and especially young trappers, expect to get a fox the  first night, and, as it would seem, think to make their set so that  not the slightest taint of man or iron lingers about the spot after  they leave it. They boil their traps in this or that, or smear them  with some odorous substance (the very thing perhaps to draw the  game's attention to them); they handle them gingerly with gloves  (which are often as strongly imbued with man smell as their naked  hands); strap hides, pieces of board or snow shoes to their feet when  setting or visiting, and in fact go through a rigmarole that would  require about half a day to set a single trap. Then they think that  if the shyest old fox imaginable should come along that night he  would walk into their snare as confidently as a cow into a stall, or  a man into his own house. Without reflecting upon the methods of any  one, we must say that we consider many of these expedients  unnecessary, unless when dealing with an unusually shrewd customer.    For my own part we make but little reckoning on a trap for the first  two or three days, especially one with bait. Sometimes, of course, a  storm helps us out, or we may nab a youngster who is green at the  game; but this is an exception, not the rule. We take all needful  precautions in respect to disturbance and scent, but our chief aim is  to secrete and cover our trap well; to cover it so that no smell or  iron can possibly reach the surface, and so that it will remain  covered for weeks if necessary, and yet be ready for business, let  the weather be what it will--snow or rain, heat or cold. Herein lies  the essence of the art; to fix your trap so that it will not soon  require your attention, then nature will speedily dispose of whatever  scent you may have left about it. We are speaking now chiefly of land  sets.    In looking up a place for a set, select one if possible where some  natural or artificial provision will admit of approach without  leaving much scent--a hard-beaten path, a double stone wall, a line  of ledges, or a combination of some such conditions, which should be  invariably followed in going to and from trap.      [Illustration: CAUGHT BY A MISSOURI TRAPPER.]    When you have decided upon the place for a trap, make all possible  preparations at a distance; then go to the spot and do your work as  quickly and cleanly as you can. If the ground is soft, use a strip of  board to stand on. If you use gloves, have some especially for the  purpose, and never leave them lying about your dog's quarters or the  house. It will do no hurt to smear them lightly with whatever you are  using for scent.    See that the trap rests evenly and firmly, so that if any part of it  be stepped on it will not tip and pull apart the covering, or grate  upon rocks or the chain. Make your excavation quite deep, filling in  the bottom with some two inches of hemlock twigs or "]]]
