THE AMPHIBIAN FAUNA OF THE LOWLANDS      In presenting an account of the amphibian fauna of the lowlands of the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec three items must be considered:         1. The composition of the fauna.         2. The ecology of the fauna.         3. The distribution of the fauna.    These items, together with similar data concerning the amphibians of  the adjacent highlands, will form the basis for the subsequent  discussion of the establishment of present patterns of distribution in  the isthmian region.      _Composition of the Fauna_    The amphibian fauna of the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec  consists of 36 species definitely recorded from the area. These include  one genus and species of caecilian, one genus, including three species  of salamanders, and 14 genera and 32 species of anurans.    In comparison with the known amphibian fauna of the forested and  savanna portions of El Peten, Guatemala (Stuart, 1935 and 1958), we  find that there are more species recorded from the isthmus than from El  Peten. Stuart found only 20 species of amphibians in both forest and  savanna habitats in El Peten. Of the 36 species of amphibians known  from the isthmus, 28 occur on the Gulf lowlands and live in forest or  savanna habitats.    The geographic position of the isthmus with regard to major faunal  areas in Middle America, and the diversity of the environment are  important factors in understanding the presence of a large number of  species of amphibians in the isthmus. The large number of species  probably is a reflection of the diversity of the environment; this  diversity is the result of fluctuation of climate, and thus  environments, in the not too distant past. In no individual habitat,  such as rainforest, savanna, or scrub forest, does the number of  species approach the total for the region.      _Ecology of the Fauna_    In the preceding section on the description of the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec I have outlined the major environments in the region. With  respect to the distribution of amphibians we may recognize three major  environments in the isthmus--rainforest, semi-arid scrub forest, and  savanna. Each of these has varying combinations of physical and biotic  factors that are important in the ecology of amphibians. Because of the  importance of moisture, not only for the maintenance of life in these  animals, but in most species their dependence on water for breeding  purposes, this environmental factor is considered the most significant  in the ecological distribution of amphibians. A second factor is the  availability of necessary shelter, especially aestivation sites. These  factors will be compared in the three major environments in the region.    Moisture is present in the environment in the form of free water or  atmospheric moisture. With respect to the latter, it is well known that  dense shaded forests have a considerably higher relative humidity than  do open plains or areas with only scattered trees. Thus, the  rainforests of the isthmus are characterized by a much higher relative  humidity than are the savannas or semi-arid scrub forests. Although  with regard to rainfall there is a pronounced dry season in the regions  supporting rainforest, there still remains considerable atmospheric  moisture in this environment throughout the year. The dense foliage  provides shade and protection from desiccating effects of wind and  sunlight; furthermore the foliage contributes moisture by  transpiration. The deep alluvial soils mixed with large quantities of  organic matter (decaying leaves and rotting logs) maintain considerable  quantities of moisture.    Conversely, the savannas and scrub forests have little atmospheric  moisture during the dry season. In the former habitat there are few  trees to provide shade or moisture through transpiration; in the latter  most of the trees lose their leaves during the dry season. Thus, these  environments are desiccated by the dry winds and direct sunlight.  Furthermore, the soils in these environments become dry and caked.  There is little or no terrestrial matter to hold moisture.    Free water in these environments is present in a variety of forms at  different times of the year. During the dry season the more extensive  marshes in the savannas persist;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38478"],[0,"Narrative of the Circumnavigation of the Globe (#5)"],[1,"it by its English equivalent. There resulted  from this a most comical jargon, sometimes most grotesque in its  eccentricity, as, for instance, when, on our remarking to one of these  vine-dressers who had been in Australia for ten years that he seemed to  have quite forgotten his German, he replied, with an air of outraged  national dignity, \"Oh no! _wir_ keep it _immer_ in exercise.\"    The entire number of Germans in New South Wales is estimated (in 1858) at  7000. They are usually settled on the larger rivers, such as Hunter,  Clarence, Brisbane rivers, where they have small farms on the alluvial  soil, or are engaged in agriculture, or vine cultivation. Their industry,  perseverance, and frugality soon make them independent and well-to-do. We  were told of one poor peasant of the Rhenish districts, named  Frauenfelder, who arrived here from Germany, in 1849, with twelve  daughters, and settled on Clarence river as a vine-dresser. After ten  years of unwearied activity he became a prosperous man, got all his  daughters well married, and now owns one of the most flourishing  settlements in the entire colony.[15] A German enjoys in Australia, after  five years' residence, the same political rights as the English. After  twelve months he becomes naturalized and may possess land; after three  years he may vote; and after five years' residence he may become a member  of Parliament. Should there be anything specially affecting German  interests in the colony, they can at least influence one vote in  Parliament. The reason why the number of Germans in Australia is yet so  small is undoubtedly owing to the high price of land. The same quantity  which can be purchased in the United States for one dollar costs L1 here,  and this solely because the Colonial Government contracted a loan in  former days with the wealthier colonists, for which they pledged the land,  which was taken at L1 per acre; this has never been paid off, so that the  mortgagee is virtually the proprietor of the soil, without Government  being in a position to profit by its contract or get rid of its  liabilities. It thus has become necessary for them to enhance the value of  the land, and this seems to be the chief difficulty in the way of lowering  the acreage price, to the manifest encouragement of emigration and the  cultivation of the soil.    Sir William conducted us, now on horseback, now on foot, now in his  carriage, over his extensive domain, and did not fail to acquaint us with  the details of everything that could be interesting or useful. Wine  cultivation in Australia, though only first raised into importance in  1838, has made such rapid strides, and has proved so profitable, that in  no long time England, hitherto so deficient in wines, will be enabled  through her colonies to vie with the choicest vintages of Europe; for  those of Australia and the Cape are little inferior even now in body and  _bouquet_ to those of Spain, and it is only the smallness of the quantity  hitherto manufactured, and almost entirely reserved for private  consumption, that has stood in the way of their being much more  extensively dealt in European markets. The entire product of wine in 1858  was 60,000 gallons, but the reason why the quantity is so limited is not  in the unsuitability of the land devoted to it, but the great difficulty  of procuring labour, and of getting it at the precise moment when it is  most wanted. As often as the journals launch forth upon the discovery of  some fresh gold-field, the field hands forthwith strike work, and make off  to the \"diggings.\" On such occasions many thousand men are suddenly  smitten with the gold fever, and their ordinary avocations are at once  abandoned. We saw on one occasion a number of half-finished houses, which  had been left in that incomplete state by the thirst for gold of the  labourers, who are omnipotent here. \"There are no greater tyrants than the  labourers of this country,\" was Sir William's pithy remark, as he looked  sadly on their work, abandoned unfinished, and the half-cultivated fields  around.    Our host made us taste various descriptions of wine, which in every  respect greatly resembled sherry, while a redder sort strongly reminded us  of Muscat. Even in Australia, the grape has already been attacked by that  mysterious disease which has done such mischief in various parts of  Europe, and especially in Madeira, but its noxious effects have as yet  been confined to a few species only. Much damage is occasionally done by a  species of worm, for the extirpation of which boys are engaged at from  1_s._ to 2_s._ per diem. The vintage in Australia usually begins in March  and lasts till far on in April.    We passed a short hour very agreeably in Sir William's study, which  comprises a library full of valuable particulars as to the history of the  country. At every moment the traveller from long-settled countries, feels  an emotion of surprise at the numerous and costly collections of rare  works and valuable cabinets of natural history he finds in a country where  he might expect that the universal rush after earthly dross must render  such pursuits valueless. The fact is, that in forming an estimate of the  country he is almost certain to omit taking into account that, in addition  to the convicts and gold-diggers, there have come out hither a  considerable number of young men of the highest circles of English  society, who, provided by Government with tracts of land for settling  upon, are in hopes of more speedily attaining fortune and position than in  England, where the younger sons of the aristocracy are in too many  instances apt to lead a sauntering life of dependency. Such cadets of  leading families have, since the commencement of the present century,  settled in considerable numbers in various parts of Australia, and have  introduced with them that taste for combined elegance and comfort, which  the foreign traveller in that country has such reason to feel surprise at,  as well as to be thankful for.    After our visit to Camden Park we spent the rest of the day at Campbelton,  making preparations to continue our excursion as far as Appin and  Wulongong, in the district of Illawara. From Campbelton to Appin is a  distance of 12 miles, by a tolerably wide level road, partly through  cultivated farms, partly through forest scenery. We encountered but one  vehicle the whole distance, containing a family dressed in their best, to  accompany a body to the grave--probably some father or sister. \"A funeral  in the bush,\" said our driver to us with a somewhat serious face, as he  called our attention to the cart moving on slowly through the stillness of  the wood. In a simple little forest hut, whose inhabitants are engaged in  avocations that necessarily imply the closest daily intimacy, the stroke  of death must fall with redoubled severity, as he strikes down some of the  dearest and best beloved.    When we reached Appin the day was already too far spent to admit of our  reaching Wulongong, the end of our journey, the same evening. Uninviting  as was the filth of the little village ale-house where we alighted, we had  to make the best of its accommodations, as it was the only inn in the  place. The dialect which now saluted our ears unmistakeably proved that we  were domiciled in an Irish house. The people were by no means poor, they  possessed an extensive \"run\" near the hotel, but it is part of the  character of Irish settlers to be superior to the virtues of cleanliness  and order. Quite close at hand began the forest, a visit to which was  rewarded by the capture of several species of birds peculiar to New South  Wales, among others the laughing jack-ass (_Dacelo gigantea_) and the  beautiful blue-black atlas bird (_Kitta holosericea_).    The following morning we resumed our journey through lofty, dense, and  magnificent forests, in which the vast trunks of gum trees imparted their  special character to the scenery. One of the most beautiful points of view  in this delightful drive was when we crossed Sir Thomas Mitchell's, or  Broughton's, Pass, which has been cut through the gigantic rocks of a  mountain-range at considerable expense and labour, presenting at every  turn a fresh and more beautiful grouping of rock and mountain fringed with  fir and gum, reminding us somewhat of the romantic savage solitudes of the  Alps.    On our way to the coast we passed but one solitary farm, consisting of a  couple of wretched wooden huts, thatched with bark, standing on a clearing  named Bargo, where the mail-boy on his way from Appin changes horses, and  remains for a few hours over-night. We merely took some coffee, and were  not a little surprised at finding it presented to us in a fashion in  strong contrast with the rude exterior of this forest hut. Sheffield and  Wedgwood wares in the bush, and English ships constructed of Australian  timber--such is the secret of English political economy!    Not far from Bargo we enter upon troublesome sand wastes, at one point of  which the traveller enjoys a wonderfully extensive prospect over the  Illawara lake, the Keira range, and the sea, especially if, as was our  case, he is accompanied by intelligent _ciceroni_ acquainted with the  country, otherwise he is likely to pass this little elevation, only a few  paces from the road, little dreaming of the magnificent landscape which he  is missing.    As soon as we got to the coast we once more encountered fan-palms,  tree-ferns, and other representatives of tropical vegetation, the last few  hours of our road towards the little port lying through scenes of  Eden-like loveliness. About 3 P.M. of the 18th November we reached  Wulongong.    We again fell in here with Sir William Macarthur, who had undertaken a  very arduous ride through the forests around Wulongong for the purpose of  collecting some tree-ferns, which he intended sending to England.
