The sun  gradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west. The wide bosom of the  Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a  gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant  mountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air  to move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually  into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the  mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the  precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth  to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering  in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging  uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed  along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the  air.    It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer  Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the  adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun  coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter  buckles. Their brisk, withered little dames, in close-crimped caps,  long-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and  pincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom  lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw  hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city  innovation. The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of  stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion  of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the  purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher  and strengthener of the hair.    Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the  gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself,  full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage.  He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all  kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for  he held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.    Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon  the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van  Tassel's mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their  luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine  Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped up  platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only  to experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the  tender oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and  short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of  cakes. And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies;  besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes  of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention  broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and  cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated  them, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the  midst--Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this  banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story.  Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but  did ample justice to every dainty.    He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion  as his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with  eating, as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his  large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that  he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury  and splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he'd turn his back upon the old  schoolhouse; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every  other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors  that should dare to call him comrade!    Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated  with content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His  hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a  shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing  invitation to \"fall to, and help themselves.\"    And now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned  to the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had  been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a  century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater  part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every  movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the  ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to  start.    Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal  powers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his  loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you  would have thought St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance,  was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the  negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm  and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at  every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their  white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How  could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? The  lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously  in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten  with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.    When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the  sager folks, who, with Old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the  piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about  the war.    This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those  highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men. The  British and American line had run near it during the war; it had,  therefore, been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees,  cowboys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had  elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little  becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to  make himself the hero of every exploit.    There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman,  who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder  from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge.  And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich  a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains,  being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small  sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and  glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to  show the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more  that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was  persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy  termination.    But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that  succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the  kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered,  long-settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting  throng that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides,  there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they  have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in  their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from  the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their  rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the  reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established  Dutch communities.    The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories  in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow.  There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted  region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting  all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at  Van Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful  legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning  cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the  unfortunate Major Andre was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood.  Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the  dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights  before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the  stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the  Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling  the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the  graves in the churchyard.    The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a  favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by  locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed  walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the  shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet  of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at  the blue hills of the Hudson.

The convoys got under way very quickly,  followed by Mounted Infantry and Life Guards. Luckily only two shells  burst, and only one mule was killed. We moved on to the spruit and were  shot at by Mausers from our right flank. The convoys were on the brink  of the drift. Some of the waggons were actually crossing, and our  artillery close on to them, when a terrific fire came from the spruit.  The U Battery was captured--the men and officers being killed, wounded,  or prisoners. We went about and retired in good order in a hail of shot,  being within 120 yards of the enemy. It is wonderful how we escaped. Two  of our men were shot--one in the thigh and the other in the  shoulder--and we had altogether 32 missing. Our leading horses and  baggage were within nine feet of the fire; yet many of them got off,  including my servant and horse. I lost, however, my saddlebags, with  change of clothes, trousers, shoes, iron kettle, and letters which I  grudge the Boers reading. We got out of fire and lined the river banks,  firing shots at the Boers, who were, however, too distant. We were well  hid in a position like what the Boers had held themselves, and we hoped  to enfilade them, but the river twisted too much, and it is impossible  to locate fire with smokeless powder. We then followed the 10th Hussars  for four miles towards Bushman's Kopje. The Ninth Division Infantry,  under Colvile, came over the ridge with eighteen guns, and we heard a  lot of heavy firing.\"    He went on to say: \"Why we are alive I can't say. Many of the bullets  were explosive, as I heard them burst when they hit the ground. The  shelling was most trying, as we had to stand quite still for twenty  minutes a living target.\"    A laughing philosopher, a Democritus of the nineteenth century, gave to  the world, _via_ the _Pall Mall Gazette_, his curious experiences. Among  other things he said:--    \"Roberts's Horse was ordered to trot off to the right of the convoy.  'Oh! those are our men, you fool,' said everybody. Two men came up to  the Colonel. 'We've got you surrounded, you'd better surrender,' say  they; and heads popped up in the grass forty yards from us. Boers  appeared all along the ridge a hundred yards ahead. 'Files about,  gallop!' yells the adjutant. (They dropped him immediately.)    \"I was carrying a fence-post to cook the breakfast of my section (of  four men). I turned my horse; there came a crackling in the air, on the  ground, everywhere; the whole world was crackling, a noise as of thorns  crackling or the cracks of a heavy whip. My gee-gee (usually slow) went  well, stimulated by the horses round it, and actually took a water-jump;  I had to hold my helmet on with my right hand, which still held the  fence-post, and I thought my knuckles would surely get grazed by a  bullet. They were pouring in a cross-fire now as well, and once or twice  I heard the _s-s-s-s-s_ of the Mauser bullet (the crackle is explosives,  you know). It was very exhilarating; the gallop and the fire made me  shout and sing and whistle. I jumped a dead man, and almost immediately  caught up B., who is one of my section.    \"The fire was slackening, and we were half a mile away by then, and we  looked round to see whether anybody was forming up. The plain was dotted  with men and many riderless horses. Everybody was yelling, 'When do we  form up?' You feel rather foolish when running away. At about one mile  we formed up again. From the rear, and from the place we had come from,  and from the river bed, there came a noise as of thousands of  shipwrights hammering. Nine (?) of our guns were captured; the remaining  three fired at intervals. My squadron was sent into a depression on the  left of the New Zealanders. Here we dismounted (No. 3 of each section  holding the horses), and went up as a firing line, range 1200, 1400, and  1600 yards. The General passed. 'Ever been in such a warm corner?' says  he to the bugler. 'Oh yes,' says the little chap, quite cheerfully and  untruthfully. The General remarked, laughing, that _he_ hadn't. I felt  sorry for him, and heard the newsboys shouting, 'Another British  disaster!' and the Continental papers, 'Nouvelle defaite des Anglais!  Yah!' It was the greatest fun out, barring the loss of the guns and men.  For we were not losing a situation of strategic importance or anything  of that kind. The Boers had collared our blankets and things, but we  chuckled at the thought of what they would suffer if they ever slept in  'em.\"    Sergeant-Major Martin, who, with Major Taylor (commanding U Battery),  was incidental in warning Colonel Rochfort and Major Phipps Hornby of  their danger, and thus assisting to save Q Battery, described his  experiences:--    \"A Boer commander stepped out and confronted the Major with fixed  bayonet; all his (the Boer's) men stood up in the spruit ready to shoot  us down if we had attempted to fight, ordered the Major to surrender,  and also the battery. The battery had no chance whatever to do anything.  As the trap was laid, so we fell into it. Now, as the Major was talking  to the Boer commander, I turned my horse round (I was then three yards  from him) and walked quietly to the rear of our battery. When I got  there, putting spurs to my horse, I galloped for all I was worth to tell  the Colonel to stop the other battery, as U Battery were all prisoners.  I then looked towards the battery; the Boers were busy disarming them. I  went a little distance in that direction to have a last look. By this  time the Household Cavalry had come up, and the 14th Hussars; they  halted, soon found out what had happened, and turned round to retire. As  they did so the Boers opened fire on us. The bullets came like  hailstones. It was a terrible sight. One gun and its team of horses  galloped away; by some means or other it was pulled up. I took  possession of it, still under this heavy fire, and, finding one of our  drivers, I put him in the wheel, and drove the leaders myself. We had  between us 14 horses. I drove in the lead for about six miles, following  the cavalry, who had gone on to see if we could get through. Eventually,  after several hours, I got into safe quarters.\"    The list of loss was terrible:--         Brevet-Major A. W. C. Booth, Northumberland Fusiliers;       Lieutenant P. Crowle, Roberts's Horse; Lieutenant Irvine, Army       Medical Service (attached to Royal Horse Artillery), were       killed. Among the wounded were: Brevet-Colonel A. N. Rochfort,       Royal Horse Artillery, Staff. Q Battery Royal Horse       Artillery.--Captain G. Humphreys, Lieutenant E. B. Ashmore,       Lieutenant H. R. Peck, Lieutenant D. J. Murch, Lieutenant J. K.       Walch, Tasmanian Artillery (attached). Royal Horse       Guards.--Lieutenant the Hon. A. V. Meade. Roberts's       Horse.--Major A. W. Pack Beresford, Captain Carrington Smith,       Lieutenant H. A. A. Darley, Lieutenant W. H. M. Kirkwood.       Mounted Infantry.--Major D. T. Cruickshank, 2nd Essex Regiment;       Lieutenant F. Russell-Brown, Royal Munster Fusiliers;       Lieutenant P. C. Grover, Shropshire Light Infantry (since       dead); Lieutenant H. C. Hall, Northumberland Fusiliers.       _Wounded and Missing._--Captain P. D. Dray, Lieutenant and       Quartermaster Hawkins. _Missing._--Lieutenant H. R. Horne.       Royal Horse Artillery.--Captain H. Rouse, Lieutenant G. H. A.       White, Lieutenant F. H. G. Stanton, Lieutenant F. L. C.       Livingstone-Learmonth. 1st Northumberland       Fusiliers.--Lieutenant H. S. Toppin. 2nd Duke of Cornwall's       Light Infantry.--Lieutenant H. T. Cantan. 1st Yorkshire Light       Infantry.--Captain G. G. Ottley. Royal West Kent       Regiment.--Lieutenant R. J. T. Hildyard. Captain Wray, Royal       Horse Artillery, Staff; Captain Dray, Roberts's Horse;       Lieutenant the Hon. D. R. H. Anderson-Pelham, 10th Hussars;       Lieutenant C. W. H. Crichton, 10th Hussars.    The casualties all told numbered some 350, including 200 missing.  Reports differ regarding the strength of the enemy. Lord Roberts  estimated it at 8000 to 10,000, while De Wet declared he had only about  1400 men.    All that remained of U Battery was one gun, Major Taylor, a  sergeant-major, a shoeing-smith, and a driver!    In Q Battery, Captain Humphreys, Lieutenants Peck, Ashmore, Murch were  wounded, and the latter two reported missing.    The whole of the grievous Saturday afternoon was spent by the gallant  doctors in tending the ninety or more of our brave wounded who lay  helpless in the spruit. They were carried to the shelter of the tin  houses, and the work of bandaging and extracting bullets was pursued  without a moment's relaxation. The removal of the sufferers from the  neighbourhood of the spruit on the day following was a sorry task, and  the sight that presented itself to the ambulance party was one which was  too shocking to be ever forgotten. In the spruit itself the wreckage of  waggons which had been looted by the Boers covered most of the scene,  and, interspersed with them were horses and cattle, maimed, mutilated,  and dead. With these, in ghastly companionship, were the bodies of slain  soldiers and black waggon-drivers. The living wounded were conveyed from  the disastrous vicinity in ambulances and waggons brought for them under  the covering fire of the guns, which swept the length of the river and  deterred the enemy from attempting to block the passage of the  melancholy party. The Republicans, however, fired viciously from  adjacent kopjes, but without disturbing the progress of the operations.    At noon General French's cavalry, with Wavell's Brigade, had left  Bloemfontein to occupy a position on the Modder between Glen and Sanna's  Post, and keep an eye on further encroachments of the Boers. The enemy,  on the fatal Saturday night, had destroyed the waterworks, thus forcing  the inhabitants of Bloemfontein to fall back on some insanitary"]]]
