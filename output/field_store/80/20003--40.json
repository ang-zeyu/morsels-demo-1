Pharaoh Necho, so Herodotus says, had  sent Phenician ships on a three-year cruise entirely around Africa. The  Phenicians also sailed by way of Gibraltar to England to bring tin from  Cornwall, and by 500 B.C. the Carthaginians were well acquainted with  the Atlantic coast of northern Africa.    At some time or other, long before the Christian era, a ship belonging  to one of the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean was probably blown to  the shores of America by the steady trade-winds. Of course, no one  can say positively that such a voyage occurred. Yet certain curious  similarities between the Old World and the New enable us to infer with a  great deal of probability that it actually happened. The mere fact, for  example, that the adobe houses of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico are  strikingly like the houses of northern Africa and Persia is no proof  that the civilization of the Old World and the New are related. A  similar physical environment might readily cause the same type of house  to be evolved in both places. When we find striking similarities  of other kinds, however, the case becomes quite different. The  constellations of the zodiac, for instance, are typified by twelve  living creatures, such as the twins, the bull, the lion, the virgin,  the crab, and the goat. Only one of the constellations, the scorpion,  presents any real resemblance to the animal for which it is named. Yet  the signs of the zodiac in Mediterranean lands and in pre-Columbian  America from Peru to southern Mexico are almost identical. Here is a  list showing the Latin and English names of the constellations and their  equivalents in the calendars of the Peruvians, Mexicans, and Mayas. *          * See S. Hagar, \"The Bearing of Astronomy on the Problems of the  Unity or Plurality and the Probable Place of Origin of the American  Aborigines, in American Anthropologist,\" vol.

The ram does not appear in  America because no such animal was known there. The nearest substitute  was the llama. In the Old World the second constellation is now called  the bull, but curiously enough in earlier days it was called the stag in  Mesopotamia. The twins, instead of being Castor and Pollux, may equally  well be a man and a woman or two generals. To landsmen not familiar  with creatures of the deep, the crab and the cuttlefish would not seem  greatly different. The lion is unknown in America, but the creature  which most nearly takes his place is the puma or ocelot. So it goes with  all the signs of the zodiac. There are little differences between  the Old World and the New, but they only emphasize the resemblance.  Mathematically there is not one chance in thousands or even millions  that such a resemblance could grow up by accident. Other similarities  between ceremonies or religious words in the Old World and the New might  be pointed out, but the zodiac is illustration enough.    Such resemblances, however, do not indicate a permanent connection  between Mediterranean civilization and that of Central America. They do  not even indicate that any one ever returned from the Western Hemisphere  to the Eastern previous to Columbus. Nor do they indicate that the  civilization of the New World arose from that of the Old. They simply  suggest that after the people of the Mediterranean regions had become  well civilized and after those of America were also sufficiently  civilized to assimilate new ideas, a stray ship or two was blown by  the trade-winds across the Atlantic. That hypothetical voyage was the  precursor of the great journey of Columbus. Without the tradewinds this  historic discoverer never could have found the West Indies. Suppose that  a strong west wind had blown him backward on his course when his men  were mutinous. Suppose that he had been forced to beat against head  winds week after week. Is there one chance in a thousand that even his  indomitable spirit could have kept his craft headed steadily into the  west? But because there were the trade-winds to bring him, the way was  opened for the energetic people of Europe to possess the new continent.  Thus the greatest stream of immigration commenced to flow, and the New  World began to take on a European aspect.        CHAPTER II. THE FORM OF THE CONTINENT    America forms the longest and straightest bone in the earth's skeleton.  The skeleton consists of six great bones, which may be said to form a  spheroidal tetrahedron, or pyramid with a triangular base, for when a  globe with a fairly rigid surface collapses because of shrinkage, it  tends to assume this form. That is what has happened to the earth.  Geologists tell us that during the thousand million years, more or less,  since geological history began, the earth has grown cooler and hence has  contracted. Moreover some of the chemical compounds of the interior have  been transformed into other compounds which occupy less space. For  these reasons the earth appears to have diminished in size until now its  diameter is from two hundred to four hundred miles less than formerly.  During the process of contraction the crust has collapsed in four main  areas, roughly triangular in shape. Between these stand the six ridges  which we have called the bones. Each of the four depressed areas forms a  side of our tetrahedron and is occupied by an ocean. The ridges and  the areas immediately flanking the oceans form the continents. The side  which we may think of as the base contains the Arctic Ocean. The ridges  surrounding it are broad and flat. Large parts of them stand above  sea-level and form the northern portions of North America, Europe, and  Asia. A second side is the Pacific Ocean with the great ridge of the two  Americas on one hand and Asia and Australia on the other. Next comes the  side containing the Indian Ocean in the hollow and the ridges of Africa  and Australia on either hand. The last of the four sides contains the  Atlantic Ocean and is bounded by Africa and Europe on one hand and North  and South America on the other. Finally the tip of the pyramid projects  above the surrounding waters, and forms the continent of Antarctica.    It may seem a mere accident that this tip lies near the South Pole,  while the center of the opposite face lies near the North Pole. Yet  this has been of almost infinite importance in the evolution not only of  plants and animals but of men. The reason is that this arrangement gives  rise to a vast and almost continuous land mass in comparatively high  latitudes. Only in such places does evolution appear to make rapid  progress. *          * W. D. Matthew, \"Climate and Evolution,\" N. Y. Acad. Sci., 1915.      Evolution is especially stimulated by two conditions. The first is that  there shall be marked changes in the environment so that the process  of natural selection has full opportunity to do its work. The second is  that numerous new forms or mutants, as the biologists call them, shall  be produced. Both of these conditions are most fully met in large  continents in the temperate zone, for in such places climatic variations  are most extreme. Such variations may take the form of extreme changes  either from day to night, from season to season, or from one century to  another. In any case, as Darwin long ago pointed out, they cause some  forms of life to perish while others survive. Thus climatic variations  are among the most powerful factors in causing natural selection and  hence in stimulating evolution. Moreover it has lately been shown  that variations in temperature are one of the chief causes of organic  variation. Morgan and Plough, * for example, have discovered that when a  certain fly, called the drosophila, is subjected to extremes of heat or  cold, the offspring show an unusually strong tendency to differ from  the parents. Hence the climatic variability of the interior of large  continents in temperate latitudes provides new forms of life and then  selects some of them for preservation. The fossils found in the rocks  of the earth's crust support this view. They indicate that most of the  great families of higher animals originated in the central part of the  great land mass of Europe and Asia. A second but much smaller area of  evolution was situated in the similar part of North America. From these  two centers new forms of life spread outward to other continents. Their  movements were helped by the fact that the tetrahedral form of the earth  causes almost all the continents to be united by bridges of land.          * Unpublished manuscript.      If any one doubts the importance of the tetrahedral form, let him  consider how evolution would have been hampered if the land of the globe  were arranged as isolated masses in low latitudes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30666"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#5)"],[1,"birds of field, forest, and garden, broken into fragments.    The Mocker's nest is loosely made of leaves and grass, rags, feathers,  etc., plain and comfortable. It is never far from the ground. The eggs  are four to six, bluish green, spattered with shades of brown.    Wilson's description of the Mocking Bird's song will probably never be  surpassed: \"With expanded wings and tail glistening with white, and  the bouyant gayety of his action arresting the eye, as his song does  most irresistably the ear, he sweeps around with enthusiastic ecstasy,  and mounts and descends as his song swells or dies away. And he often  deceives the sportsman, and sends him in search of birds that are not  perhaps within miles of him, but whose notes he exactly imitates.\"    Very useful is he, eating large spiders and grasshoppers, and the  destructive cottonworm.          THE LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE.      A rambler in the fields and woodlands during early spring or  the latter part of autumn is often surprised at finding insects,  grasshoppers, dragon flies, beetles of all kinds, and even larger  game, mice, and small birds, impaled on twigs and thorns. This is  apparently cruel sport, he observes, if he is unacquainted with the  Butcher Bird and his habits, and he at once attributes it to the  wanton sport of idle children who have not been led to say,        With hearts to love, with eyes to see,      With ears to hear their minstrelsy;      Through us no harm, by deed or word,      Shall ever come to any bird.    If he will look about him, however, the real author of this mischief  will soon be detected as he appears with other unfortunate little  creatures, which he requires to sustain his own life and that of his  nestlings. The offender he finds to be the Shrike of the northern  United States, most properly named the Butcher Bird. Like all tyrants  he is fierce and brave only in the presence of creatures weaker than  himself, and cowers and screams with terror if he sees a falcon. And  yet, despite this cruel proceeding, which is an implanted instinct  like that of the dog which buries bones he never seeks again, there  are few more useful birds than the Shrike. In the summer he lives on  insects, ninety-eight per cent. of his food for July and August  consisting of insects, mainly grasshoppers; and in winter, when  insects are scarce, mice form a very large proportion of his food.    The Butcher Bird has a very agreeable song, which is soft and musical,  and he often shows cleverness as a mocker of other birds. He has been  taught to whistle parts of tunes, and is as readily tamed as any of  our domestic songsters.    The nest is usually found on the outer limbs of trees, often from  fifteen to thirty feet from the ground. It is made of long strips of  the inner bark of bass-wood, strengthened on the sides with a few dry  twigs, stems, and roots, and lined with fine grasses. The eggs are  often six in number, of a yellowish or clayey-white, blotched and  marbled with dashes of purple, light brown, and purplish gray. Pretty  eggs to study.    Readers of BIRDS who are interested in eggs do not need to disturb  the mothers on their nests in order to see and study them. In all the  great museums specimens of the eggs of nearly all birds are displayed  in cases, and accurately colored plates have been made and published  by the Smithsonian Institution and others. The Chicago Academy of  Sciences has a fine collection of eggs. Many persons imagine that  these institutions engage in cruel slaughter of birds in order to  collect eggs and nests. This, of course, is not true, only the fewest  number being taken, and with the exclusive object of placing before  the people, not for their amusement but rather for their instruction,  specimens of birds and animals which shall serve for their  identification in forest and field.    The Loggerhead Shrike and nest shown in this number were taken under  the direction of Mr. F. M. Woodruff, at Worth, Ill., about fourteen  miles from Chicago. The nest was in a corner of an old hedge of Osage  Orange, and about eight feet from the ground. He says in the _Osprey_  that it took considerable time and patience to build up a platform of  fence boards and old boxes to enable the photographer to do his work.  The half-eaten body of a young garter snake was found about midway  between the upper surface of the nest and the limb above, where it had  been hung up for future use.    [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences. LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE.]          THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE.      Baltimore Orioles are inhabitants of the whole of North America, from  Canada to Mexico. They enter Louisiana as soon as spring commences  there. The name of Baltimore Oriole has been given it, because its  colors of black and orange are those of the family arms of Lord  Baltimore, to whom Maryland formerly belonged. Tradition has it that  George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore, worn out and discouraged  by the various trials and rigours of temperature experienced in his  Newfoundland colony in 1628, visited the Virginia settlement. He  explored the waters of the Chesapeake, and found the woods and shores  teeming with birds, among them great flocks of Orioles, which so  cheered him by their beauty of song and splendor of plumage, that  he took them as good omens and adopted their colors for his own.    When the Orioles first arrive the males are in the majority; they sit  in the spruces calling by the hour, with lonely querulous notes. In a  few days however, the females appear, and then the martial music  begins, the birds' golden trumpeting often turning to a desperate  clashing of cymbals when two males engage in combat, for \"the Oriole  has a temper to match his flaming plumage and fights with a will.\"    This Oriole is remarkably familiar, and fearless of man, hanging its  beautiful nest upon the garden trees, and even venturing into the  street wherever a green tree nourishes. The materials of which its  nest is made are flax, various kinds of vegetable fibers, wool, and  hair, matted together so as to resemble felt in consistency. A  number of long horse-hairs are passed completely through the fibers,  sewing it firmly together with large and irregular, but strong and  judiciously placed stitching. In one of these nests an observer found  that several of the hairs used for this purpose measured two feet in  length. The nest is in the form of a long purse, six or seven inches  in depth, three or four inches in diameter; at the bottom is arranged  a heap of soft material in which the eggs find a warm resting place.  The female seems to be the chief architect, receiving a constant  supply of materials from her mate, occasionally rejecting the fibers  or hairs which he may bring, and sending him off for another load more  to her taste.    Like human builders, the bird improves in nest building by practice,  the best specimens of architecture being the work of the oldest birds,  though some observers deny this.    The eggs are five in number, and their general color is whitish-pink,  dotted at the larger end with purplish spots, and covered at the  smaller end with a great number of fine intersecting lines of the same  hue.    In spring the Oriole's food seems to be almost entirely of an animal  nature, consisting of caterpillars, beetles, and other insects, which  it seldom pursues on the wing, but seeks with great activity among  the leaves and branches. It also eats ripe fruit. The males of this  elegant species of Oriole acquire the full beauty of their plumage the  first winter after birth.    The Baltimore Oriole is one of the most interesting features of  country landscape, his movements, as he runs among the branches of  trees, differing from those of almost all other birds. Watch him  clinging by the feet to reach an insect so far away as to require the  full extension of the neck, body, and legs without letting go his  hold. He glides, as it were, along a small twig, and at other times  moves sidewise for a few steps. His motions are elegant and stately.          THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE.      About the middle of May, when the leaves are all coming out to see the  bright sunshine, you may sometimes see, among the boughs, a bird of  beautiful black and orange plumage.    He looks like the Orchard Oriole, whose picture you saw in May  \"Birds.\" It is the Baltimore Oriole. He has other names, such as  \"Golden Robin,\" \"Fire Bird,\" \"Hang-nest.\" I could tell you how he came  to be called Baltimore Oriole, but would rather you'd ask your teacher  about it. She can tell you all about it, and an interesting story it  is, I assure you.    You see from the picture why he is called \"Hang-nest.\" Maybe you can  tell why he builds his nest that way.    The Orioles usually select for their nest the longest and slenderest  twigs, way out on the highest branches of a large tree. They like the  elm best. From this they hang their bag-like nest.    It must be interesting to watch them build the nest, and it requires  lots of patience, too, for it usually takes a week or ten days to  build it.    They fasten both ends of a string to the twigs between which the nest  is to hang. After fastening many strings like this, so as to cross one  another, they weave in other strings crosswise, and this makes a sort  of bag or pouch. Then they put in the lining.    Of course, it swings and rocks when the wind blows, and what a nice  cradle it must be for the baby Orioles?    Orioles like to visit orchards and eat the bugs, beetles and  caterpillars that injure the trees and fruit.    There are few birds who do more good in this way than Orioles.    Sometimes they eat grapes from the vines and peck at fruit on the  trees. It is usually because they want a drink that they do this.    One good man who had a large orchard and vineyard placed pans of water  in different places. Not only the Orioles, but other birds, would go  to the pan for a drink,"]]]
