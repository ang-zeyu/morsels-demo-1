The  \"well-known scheme of alcoholic fermentation\" according to Albert Jan  Kluyver (1888-1956), presented before the Society of Chemical Industry  in the Royal Institution, March 7, 1951. In _Chemistry & Industry_,  1952, page 136 ff., Kluyver restates that \"... the fermentation of one  molecule of glucose is indissolubly connected with the formation of two  molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) out of two molecules of  adenosine diphosphate (ADP).\"]    Shortly after this experience had been gained, it became valuable for  understanding the chemical nature of a new substance extracted from a  natural organ. This substance was named lecithin by its discoverer,  Nicolas Theodore Gobley[27] (1811-1876), because he obtained it from egg  yolk (in Greek, _lekidos_). He used ether and alcohol for this  extraction. Had he used water and mineral acid instead, he would not  have found lecithin, but only its components. As Gobley and, slightly  later, Oscar Liebreich (1839-1908), subjected lecithin to treatment with  boiling water and acid, they separated it into three parts. One of them  was the glycerophosphoric acid of Pelouze, the second was the well-known  stearic acid of Chevreul, but the third was somewhat mysterious. This  third substance was the same as one previously noticed when nerves had  been subjected to an extraction by boiling water and acid and,  therefore, called nerve-substance or neurine. Adolf Friedrich Strecker  (1822-1871) established the identity of this neurine with a product he  had extracted from bile and which went under the name of choline.  Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) succeeded in synthesizing this substance from  ethylene oxide, CH_2.O.CH_2 and trimethylamine N(CH_3)_3.[28] Thus, all  three parts were identified, and Strecker put them together to construct  a chemical formula for lecithin, glycerophosphoric acid combined with a  fatty acid and with choline (a hydrate of neurine).                            { OH       }                        N { (CH_3)_3 } Choline                          { C_2H_4O  }          C_18H_33O_2 }               HO }                  }                  } PO      C_16H_31O_2 }          C_3H_5O }        Fatty Acids        Glycerophosphate            \\--------v-------/                 Lecithin            according to Strecker    This formula was not quite correct. Richard Willstaetter showed that an  internal neutralization takes place between the amino group and the free  acidic residue. This is expressed in his lecithin formula of 1918.        CH_{2}.O.R      |      CH_{2}.O.R_2      |      |           O.CH_{2}.CH_{2}      |          /          \\      CH_{2}.O--P=O         N(CH_{3})_{3}                 \\          /                  \\---O----/    [Illustration: Lecithin (1918)]    When the aim was to distill elementary phosphorus out of an organic  material, it did not matter whether this was fresh or putrified. For  obtaining lecithin out of egg yolk and similar materials, it was  essential to use it in fresh condition. Otherwise, enzymes would have  decomposed it. Through more recent work, four enzymes have been  separated, which act specifically in decomposing lecithin. Enzyme A  removes one fatty acid and leaves a complex residue, called  lysolecithin, intact. Enzyme B attacks this residue and splits off the  remaining fatty acid group from it, enzyme C liberates only the choline  from lecithin, and enzyme D opens lecithin at the ester bond between  glycerol and phosphoric acid. This is shown in the following diagram.

D      Lecithin      Phosphoryl choline and                             diglyceride.    Several fatty acids can be present in lecithin from various sources:  palmitic and oleic acid, besides the stearic acid which at first had  been thought the only one involved. In another group of extracts from  brain or nerve tissue, amino-ethanol H_{2}NCH_{2}CH_{2}OH is found  instead of the choline of lecithin. The variations include the alcohol,  to which the fatty acids and choline phosphate are attached, for  example, glycerol can be replaced by the so-called meat-sugar, inositol,  which has six hydroxyl groups in its hexagon-shaped molecule  C_{6}H_{6}(OH)_{6}.    [Illustration: Figure 14.--EDUARD BUCHNER (1860-1917) received the Nobel  Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of cell-free fermentation, the  first step in finding the role of phosphate in fermentations (1907).]    The generally similar behavior of these phosphate-and fat-containing  substances was emphasized by Ludwig Thudichum (1829-1901). He coined the  name phosphatides for this group of substances from seeds and  nerves.[29] His work on the phosphates in brain substance aroused  particular interest. When William Crookes drew his highly imaginative  picture of an \"evolution\" of the chemical elements, he put into it  \"phosphorus for the brain, salt for the sea, clay for the solid  earth....\"[30] But phosphatides occur in many places of organisms, in  bacteria, in leaves and roots of plants, in fat and tissues of animals.  And where phosphatides are found, there are also enzymes that  specifically act on them. They are called phosphatases to imply that  they split the phosphatides. In addition, enzymes are present, which  transfer phosphate groups from one compound to another. They are more  abundant in seeds of high fat content than in the more starch-containing  seeds, but even potatoes and orange juice have phosphatases.[31]    Thus, from phosphatides, phosphoric acid is generated, and they could  also be called phosphagens. Since 1926, however, the name phosphagens  has been reserved for a group of organic substances that release their  phosphoric acid very readily. The link between phosphorus and carbon is  provided by oxygen in the phosphatides, by nitrogen in the phosphagens.  In vertebrates, the basis for the phosphoric acid is creatine, whereas  invertebrates have arginine instead.

Only with this in mind  does it make sense to say that the most important part of the cell is  its nucleus. From the nuclei of cells in pus and in salmon sperm, Johann  Friedrich Miescher (1811-1887) obtained a peculiar kind of substance,  which he named nuclein (1868). Its phosphate content was easily  discovered, but to find the exact proportions and the nature of the  other components required special methods of separation from  phosphatides and other proteins. It was difficult to develop such  methods at a time when little was known about the properties, and  particularly the stability, of a nuclein. For preparing nuclein from  yeast cells, Felix Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895) described the following  details: Yeast is dispersed in water to extract soluble materials, like  salts or sugars. After a few hours, the insoluble material is separated,  washed once more with water, and then extracted with a very dilute  solution of sodium hydroxide. The slightly alkaline solution, freed from  insoluble residues, is slowly added to a weak hydrochloric acid. A  precipitate forms which is separated by filtration, washed with dilute  acid, then with cold alcohol, and finally extracted by boiling alcohol.  The dried residue is the nuclein.[32] It contains six percent  phosphorus. A little more washing with water, a slightly longer  treatment with acid or alcohol gives products of lower phosphorus  content. Many experimental variations were necessary to establish the  procedure that leads to purification without alteration of the natural  substance.    This was also true for the methods of chemical degradation, carried out  in order to find the components of nucleins in their highest state of  natural complexity. It was learned for example, that the special kind of  carbohydrate present in nucleins was very susceptible to change under  the conditions of hydrolysis by acids. Phoebus Aaron Theodor Levine  (1869-1940), therefore, used the digestion by a living organism. With E.  S. London, he introduced a solution of nucleic acid into, e.g., the  gastrointestinal segment of a dog through a gastric fistula and withdrew  the product of digestion through an intestinal fistula. Fortunately, the  products obtained in such degradations were not new in themselves. The  carbohydrate in this nucleic acid proved to be identical with D-ribose,  which Emil Fischer had artificially made from arabinose and named ribose  to indicate this relationship (1891). The nitrogenous products of the  degradation were identical with substances previously prepared in the  long study of uric acid. In the course of this study, Emil Fischer  established uric acid and a number of its derivatives as having the  elementary skeleton of what he called \"pure uric acid,\" abbreviated to  purine. Out of Adolf Baeyer's work on barbituric acid came the knowledge  of pyrimidine and its derivatives.    [Illustration: Figure 15.--ALBRECHT KOSSEL (1853-1927) received the  Nobel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#5)"],[1,"heater and boiler, and have hot water pipe connections.  This of course is only possible when there is a tank and power of some  kind to pump up the water. There should be in the kitchen ample table  space, convenient places for keeping all pots and kettles, hanging  spoons and other small articles, a generous wood box that there may  always be dry wood at hand, and if there is running water a sink  conveniently placed.    The store closet should open out of the kitchen and be on the north side  of the house. It should have a raised platform 18 or 20 inches wide,  against the wall on one side of the room, on which should be placed all  barrels, large boxes, etc. holding food. There should be ample shelf  space, a broad table, plenty of ventilation, and all windows should be  covered with netting.    If possible to have an ice box it can stand in this room. Better than a  portable ice box is an ice room which is built into one corner of the  store room, the walls, floor and ceiling of which are double, lined with  tar paper and the space of four inches between them filled with sawdust  or cork. The door into the store room should be very heavy, made double  and fitted closely. The small ice door can be on the outside of the  building, made like the large door, fitted closely and opening into the  ice compartment. The ice compartment should be lined with zinc and a  slatted door should open into it from the ice room. The bottom of the  ice compartment should tip slightly to one corner from which an overflow  pipe should be run to the outside of the building. A slat bottom made in  sections and placed in the compartment protects the zinc and helps to  preserve the ice. The ice compartment can be high enough from the floor  to admit of large milk cans, tubs of butter, etc., being stored under  it. Shelves can be placed along the sides of the walls. The ice room  should be ventilated by means of a vent pipe up through the roof to the  open.    Such a building as described makes housekeeping for a family of one  hundred and fifty or two hundred possible, with only one cook and a  squad of Scouts.    In place of tents for sleeping quarters small cabins made of wood and  screening, or wood, canvas and screening, can be used. They add greatly  to the expense of building the camp, but being permanent do away with  the expense and labor of taking down and storing.    It is sometimes possible to find an old house or a barn which can be  utilized for camp quarters, and with a little ingenuity made most  attractive and practical.    There is a great deal to be learned by living in a well-planned,  well-ordered house or camp, much of which is of lasting value. For this  reason no opportunity should be lost to give these advantages to the  Scouts.      Wash House    A wash house for general use is most desirable. Where there is no  running water a long table covered with zinc and placed under a tent  fly, a board walk either side of the table, and three or four large  pitchers for water is a good arrangement. This equipment should be  placed in an open, sunny spot where the drainage is good, and away from  the tents if the waste water is to be thrown out on the ground.    Where a group is small every six or eight girls may have a shelf placed  between two trees, which would serve as a wash stand. Pitchers must be  provided for each stand and a system for keeping them filled worked out.    A type of wash house which is most satisfactory where there is  plumbing, is made as follows. (p. 31.) Build an oblong platform and over  it a roof supported by posts and covered with tar paper. Through the  center of the house build a trough, with inclined bottom, and a shelf  slightly tipped toward the trough, either side of it. Cover the inside  of the trough and the shelves with zinc. At the lower end of the trough  have a waste pipe which runs into a cesspool. Over the trough supported  from the roof run a water pipe from which depend at intervals, pipes  with automatic faucets. At the low end of the trough two wash tubs can  be placed at right angles to the wash table both of which should connect  with the trough drain pipe. Enclose the other end of the house and make  two small private wash rooms, the partition between them being over and  under the center of the trough, a faucet in each. These rooms are to be  used by counsellors, or by children when given special permission.

Camp boundaries are for a purpose, do not go            beyond them without permission from a counsellor            or the Director.              Rest hours, from taps to reveille and after            dinner, are a necessity to health; observe them by            sleeping. Do not talk, it disturbs others.              For the sake of cleanliness take no food of any            kind, or liquids of any kind into any tent used            for sleeping quarters.              Keep the Health Record of the camp high by            reporting at once to the nurse or Director any            sickness, accident or ill health.              First aid supplies when required can be obtained            from the nurse, no one else is to touch them.              Trash boxes are labor saving devices, use them for            all trash, rather than throwing the trash on the            ground.              Food sent or brought to camp for individual Scouts            will not be delivered.          V    GENERAL ROUTINE FROM OPENING TO CLOSING CAMP      After the site is obtained, necessary buildings finished, grounds  cleaned, stove in place, water tested and connections made if there is  to be plumbing, the equipment and provisions should be sent in to camp.  A week is none too long a time to allow, even if there are many hands to  unpack, put the camp in running order, make out the program, camp  regulations, etc., and select sites for classes.    If possible have the counsellors spend this week in camp with the  Director and help in doing this work. Being together for work and some  play will prepare them to take up the duties of the summer and if any of  them are not Scouts then is the time to tell them of the Scout work, its  aims and so forth. Without this information it is difficult to have true  cooperation.    When opening a large camp be sure, when the campers arrive, to have it  in the condition in which it is to be kept. First impressions are deep  impressions as a rule, even though unfair many times.      Pitching Tents    Perhaps the most difficult work to be done, especially for one who knows  little about it is the pitching of the tents, yet when simple rules are  followed the task is not beyond a group of young women even when the  tents are large. Remember that the beauty of a tent lies in its  trimness. It should look smart. The canvas must have no wrinkles, poles  must be straight, ropes taut and properly fastened.    First of all see that the tent floors and frame work are as they should  be, or lacking a frame work, that pegs are at hand. Examine poles and  make sure they are of the right height and length for the tent. If a  wall tent is to be pitched lay it on floor, inside down, the fly on top  of it. Run the ridge pole under the center of the tent from end to end  curved side next to the canvas; at either end of the tent at right  angles to the ridge pole and parallel to each other place a tent pole  which is the right length for the height of the tent. Put the spindle in  the end of each pole through the holes in the ridge pole, and the  eyelets in the tent and tent fly ridge.    [Illustration: SERVING TABLE]    Two people, one at each pole, on signal, raise the tent into position by  lifting the poles and carrying them into place. They should stand  opposite each other, at the center of either end of the tent floor.  While the poles are held in place, two other people should fasten  temporarily the corner ropes of the tent and fly. Tie the flaps into  position, fasten the corner rope loops in the bottom edge of the tent to  nails in the edge of the floor, and proceed to adjust the guy ropes. Do  not pull the tent out of line or have one rope tighter than another.  Use a clove hitch for tying the ropes to the strips. The ropes of the  tent should go under the strip for the first turn, the fly ropes over.  By so doing the roof of the tent and the fly will be kept apart, a most  important point; in fact they should never touch except at the ridge.    Fasten the tent to the floor by putting the rope loops in the bottom of  the tent over long nails driven into the edge of the tent floor at the  proper places. When all ropes are fastened and the tent looks as it  should, loosen the bottom at each end, untie the flaps, and hold them  back by fastening one of the ropes in the bottom of the flap into the  loop at the top corner of the tent wall.    Put the tent number on each pole. Cots can now be opened and placed,  blankets shaken, sunned, folded and put on the foot of the cots with a  pillow inside of each blanket. Basins go under the cots toward the head.    While four or five people are attending to the sleeping quarters others  should be washing, wiping and putting away all table ware, and the cook  arranging the kitchen, store room and ice house.
