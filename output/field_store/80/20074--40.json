As usual, the storeys are separated by disks of  sorghum. The anchorites, when hatched, do not hesitate long. Once the  partition is pierced, they attack the dead cocoons, go right through  them, reducing the dead grub, now dry and shrivelled, to dust, and at  last emerge, after wrecking everything in their path. The dead cocoons,  therefore, are not spared; they are treated as would be any other  obstacle capable of attack by the mandibles. The Osmia looks upon them  as a mere barricade to be ruthlessly overturned. How is she apprised  that the cocoon, which has undergone no outward change, contains a dead  and not a live grub? It is certainly not by sight. Can it be by sense of  smell? I am always a little suspicious of that sense of smell of  which we do not know the seat and which we introduce on the slightest  provocation as a convenient explanation of that which may transcend our  explanatory powers.    My next test is made with a string of live cocoons. Of course, I cannot  take all these from the same species, for then the experiment would not  differ from the one which we have already witnessed; I take them  from two different species which leave their bramble-stem at separate  periods. Moreover, these cocoons must have nearly the same diameter to  allow of their being stacked in a tube without leaving an empty space  between them and the wall. The two species adopted are Solenius vagus,  which quits the bramble at the end of June, and Osmia detrita, which  comes a little earlier, in the first fortnight of the same month. I  therefore alternate Osmia-cocoons and Solenius-cocoons, with the  latter at the top of the series, either in glass tubes or between two  bramble-troughs joined into a cylinder.    The result of this promiscuity is striking. The Osmiae, which mature  earlier, emerge; and the Solenius-cocoons, as well as their inhabitants,  which by this time have reached the perfect stage, are reduced to  shreds, to dust, wherein it is impossible for me to recognize a vestige,  save perhaps here and there a head, of the exterminated unfortunates.  The Osmia, therefore, has not respected the live cocoons of a foreign  species: she has passed out over the bodies of the intervening Solenii.  Did I say passed over their bodies? She has passed through them,  crunched the laggards between her jaws, treated them as cavalierly as  she treats my disks. And yet those barricades were alive. No matter:  when her hour came, the Osmia went ahead, destroying everything upon  her road. Here, at any rate, is a law on which we can rely: the supreme  indifference of the animal to all that does not form part of itself and  its race.    And what of the sense of smell, distinguishing the dead from the living?  Here, all are alive; and the Bee pierces her way as through a row of  corpses. If I am told that the smell of the Solenii may differ from that  of the Osmiae, I shall reply that such extreme subtlety in the insect's  olfactory apparatus seems to me a rather far-fetched supposition. Then  what is my explanation of the two facts? The explanation? I have none  to give! I am quite content to know that I do not know, which at least  spares me many vain lucubrations. And so I do not know how the Osmia,  in the dense darkness of her tunnel, distinguishes between a live cocoon  and a dead cocoon of the same species; and I know just as little how  she succeeds in recognizing a strange cocoon. Ah, how clearly this  confession of ignorance proves that I am behind the times! I am  deliberately missing a glorious opportunity of stringing big words  together and arriving at nothing.    The bramble-stump is perpendicular, or nearly so; its opening is at the  top. This is the rule under natural conditions. My artifices are able  to alter that state of things; I can place the tube vertically or  horizontally; I can turn its one orifice either up or down; lastly, I  can leave the channel open at both ends, which will give two outlets.  What will happen under these several conditions? That is what we shall  examine with the Three-pronged Osmia.    The tube is hung perpendicularly, but closed at the top and open at the  bottom; in fact, it represents a bramble-stump turned upside down. To  vary and complicate the experiment, the strings of cocoons are arranged  differently in different tubes. In some of them, the heads of the  cocoons are turned downwards, towards the opening; in others, they are  turned upwards, towards the closed end; in others again, the cocoons  alternate in direction, that is to say, they are placed head to head and  rear to rear, turn and turn about. I need not say that the separating  floors are of sorghum.    The result is identical in all these tubes. If the Osmiae have their  heads pointing upwards, they attack the partition above them, as happens  under normal conditions; if their heads point downwards, they turn round  in their cells and set to work as usual. In short, the general outward  trend is towards the top, in whatever position the cocoon be placed.    We here see manifestly at work the influence of gravity, which warns  the insect of its reversed position and makes it turn round, even as it  would warn us if we ourselves happened to be hanging head downwards.  In natural conditions, the insect has but to follow the counsels of  gravity, which tells it to dig upwards, and it will infallibly reach the  exit-door situated at the upper end. But, in my apparatus, these same  counsels betray it: it goes towards the top, where there is no outlet.  Thus misled by my artifices, the Osmiae perish, heaped up on the higher  floors and buried in the ruins.    It nevertheless happens that attempts are made to clear a road  downwards. But it is rare for the work to lead to anything in this  direction, especially in the case of the middle or upper cells. The  insect is little inclined for this progress, the opposite to that to  which it is accustomed; besides, a serious difficulty arises in  the course of this reversed boring. As the Bee flings the excavated  materials behind her, these fall back of their own weight under  her mandibles; the clearance has to be begun anew. Exhausted by her  Sisyphean task, distrustful of this new and unfamiliar method, the Osmia  resigns herself and expires in her cell. I am bound to add, however,  that the Osmiae in the lower storeys, those nearest the exit--sometimes  one, sometimes two or three--do succeed in escaping. In that case, they  unhesitatingly attack the partitions below them, while their companions,  who form the great majority, persist and perish in the upper cells.    It was easy to repeat the experiment without changing anything in the  natural conditions, except the direction of the cocoons: all that I had  to do was to hang up some bramble-stumps as I found them, vertically,  but with the opening downwards. Out of two stalks thus arranged and  peopled with Osmiae, not one of the insects succeeded in emerging. All  the Bees died in the shaft, some turned upwards, others downwards.  On the other hand, three stems occupied by Anthidia discharged their  population safe and sound. The outgoing was effected at the bottom, from  first to last, without the least impediment. Must we take it that  the two sorts of Bees are not equally sensitive to the influences of  gravity? Can the Anthidium, built to pass through the difficult obstacle  of her cotton wallets, be better-adapted than the Osmia to make her way  through the wreckage that keeps falling under the worker's feet; or,  rather, may not this very cotton-waste put a stop to these cataracts of  rubbish which must naturally drive the insect back? This is all quite  possible; but I can say nothing for certain.    Let us now experiment with vertical tubes open at both ends. The  arrangements, save for the upper orifice, are the same as before. The  cocoons, in some of the tubes, have their heads turned down; others,  up; in others again, their positions alternate. The result is similar to  what we have seen above. A few Osmiae, those nearest the bottom orifice,  take the lower road, whatever the direction first occupied by the  cocoon; the others, composing by far the larger number, take the higher  road, even when the cocoon is placed upside down. As both doors are  free, the outgoing is effected at either end with success.    What are we to conclude from all these experiments? First, that gravity  guides the insect towards the top, where the natural door is, and makes  it turn in its cell when the cocoon has been reversed. Secondly, I seem  to suspect an atmospheric influence and, in any case, some second cause  that sends the insect to the outlet. Let us admit that this cause is  the proximity of the outer air acting upon the anchorite through the  partitions.    The animal then is subject, on the one hand, to the promptings of  gravity, and this to an equal degree for all, whatever the storey  inhabited. Gravity is the common guide of the whole series from base to  top. But those in the lower boxes have a second guide, when the bottom  end is open. This is the stimulus of the adjacent air, a more powerful  stimulus than that of gravity. The access of the air from without is  very slight, because of the partitions; while it can be felt in the  nethermost cells, it must decrease rapidly as the storeys ascend.  Wherefore the bottom insects, very few in number, obeying the  preponderant influence, that of the atmosphere, make for the lower  outlet and reverse, if necessary, their original position; those above,  on the contrary, who form the great majority, being guided only by  gravity when the upper end is closed, make for that upper end. It goes  without saying that, if the upper end be open at the same time as the  other, the occupants of the top storeys will have a double incentive to  take the ascending path, though this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#5)"],[1,"those days, only very strong men  could endure the hardships of soldier-life, {30} it is fair to suppose that  our age has not so greatly degenerated in respect to physical strength.    [Sidenote: 13 Action? Use of organs? Training of the mind? The child's  brain? Education of the body?]    13. IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISE.--Action is the law of the living body. Every  organ demands use to preserve it in full vigor, and to obtain from it its  best services. The value of that training of the mind, which we call  education, is everywhere recognized. The child is early put to school, and  for many years continues to study, in order that his brain, which is the  great centre of mental power, may act healthfully and with force. It is  important that the body, also, should receive its education by exercise.  This is especially true of persons belonging to certain classes of society,  whose occupation confines them within doors, and requires chiefly  brain-work.    [Sidenote: 14 Work in the open air? A perfect business? The consequence of  universal perfect business? Occupation of children?]    14. Persons who are engaged in manual labor in the open air obtain all the  exercise necessary for bodily health in their regular business: their need  is more likely to be a discipline or exercise of the mind. A perfect  business of life, therefore, would be one which would combine both physical  and mental labor in their proper proportions. If such a business were  possible for all the human race, life would thereby be vastly prolonged.  Such is, in fact, to a large extent, the occupation pertaining to one  period of life--childhood. A part of the time is spent by the child in  improving his mind by study, and another part of the time he has physical  exercise in his games and sports.    [Sidenote: 15 In what does exercise consist? Effects of it?]    15. THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE.--Exercise consists in a well-regulated use of  the voluntary muscular system. The effects, however, are not limited to the  parts used. Other organs, which are not under the control of the will, are  indirectly influenced by it. For instance, the heart beats more rapidly,  the skin acts more freely, and {31} becomes hotter, as well as the parts  beneath it, and the appetite and power of digestion are increased. An  increased exhalation from the lungs and skin purifies the current of the  circulation, and the body as a whole thrives under its influence.    [Sidenote: 16. General effect upon the muscles? Special effect? Effects of  inaction? Of excessive exercise?]    16. The immediate effect of exercise, however, is upon the muscles  themselves; for by use they become firm and large, and increase in power.  If we examine a muscle thus improved by exercise, we find that its fibres  have become larger and more closely blended together, that its color is of  a darker red, and that the supply of blood-vessels has increased. Without  exercise the muscle appears thin, flabby, and pale. On the other hand,  excessive exercise, without sufficient relaxation, produces in the muscle a  condition not very different from that which follows disuse. The muscle is  worn out faster than nature builds it up, and it becomes flabby, pale, and  weak.    [Sidenote: 17. Of violent and spasmodic efforts? Strength, how attained?  Give the particulars.]    17. Violent exercise is not beneficial; and spasmodic efforts to increase  the muscular strength are not calculated to secure such a result. Strength  is the result of a gradual growth, and is most surely acquired if the  exercise be carried to a point short of fatigue, and after an adequate  interval of rest. To gain the most beneficial results, the exercise should  be at regular hours, and during a regular period. The activity of the  exercise, and the time devoted to it must vary, of course, with the  strength of the individual, and should be carefully measured by it.    [Sidenote: 18. What may walking be called? What further is said of  walking?]    18. DIFFERENT MODES OF EXERCISE.--There are very few who have not the power  to walk. There is required for it no expensive apparatus, nor does it  demand a period of preliminary training. _Walking may be called the  universal exercise._ With certain foreign nations, the English {32}  especially, it is a very popular exercise, and is practised habitually by  almost every class of society; by the wealthy as well as by those who have  no carriages; by women as well as by men.    [Sidenote: 19. What is said of running, and other like movements? What, as  related to childhood? What instances are alluded to? Example?]    19. Running, leaping, and certain other more rapid and violent movements,  are the forms of exercise that are most enjoyed in childhood. For the  child, they are not too severe, but they may be so prolonged as to become  injurious. Instances have been recorded where sudden death has resulted  after violent playing, from overtaxing the heart: for example, we have the  case of a young girl who, while skipping the rope, and endeavoring to excel  her playmates by jumping the greatest number of times, fell dead from  rupture of the heart.    [Sidenote: 20. Carriage-riding? Horseback-riding?]    20. Carriage-riding, as a means of passive exercise, is particularly well  suited to invalids, and persons advanced in life. Horseback exercise brings  into use a greater number of muscles than any other one exercise, and with  it there is an exhilaration of feeling which refreshes the mind at the same  time. It is one of the manliest of exercises, but not less suitable for  women than for men. To be skilful in riding, it is best to begin its  practice in youth; but there are very few kinds of exercise of which the  same is not equally true.    [Sidenote: 21. Boating, swimming, and skating?]    21. For those who live near streams or bodies of water, there are the  delightful recreations of boating, swimming, and skating. Certain of these  exercises have a practical importance aside from and above their use in  increasing the physical vigor. This is especially true of boating and  swimming, since they are often the means of saving life. Practice in these  exercises also teaches self-reliance, courage, and presence of mind.  Persons who have become proficient in these vigorous exercises are  generally the ones, {33} who, in times of danger, are the quickest to act  and the most certain to do so with judgment.    [Sidenote: 22. What kind of exercise yields the best results? What advice  is given?]    22. PHYSICAL CULTURE.--That form of exercise which interests and excites  the mind, will yield the best results; but to some persons no kind of  exertion whatever is, at first, agreeable. They should, nevertheless, make  a trial of some exercise, in the expectation that, as they become  proficient in it, it will become more pleasant. In exercise, as many sets  of muscles should be employed as possible, open-air exercise being the  best. Parlor gymnastics, and the discipline of the gymnasium are desirable,  but they should not be the sole reliance for physical culture. No in-door  exercise, however excellent in itself, can fill the place of hearty and  vigorous activity in the open air.    [Sidenote: 23. Physical culture among the ancients? In Greece? In schools  and colleges at the present time? Result to the body and mind?]    23. GYMNASTIC EXERCISES FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES.--In the system of  education among the ancients, physical culture predominated. In ancient  Greece, physical exercises in schools were prescribed and regulated by law,  and hence these schools were called _gymnasia_. At the present time, on the  contrary, this culture is almost wholly unknown, as a part of the course of  education, in our schools and colleges. In a few of our institutions of  learning, however, physical exercises have been introduced, with manifest  advantage to the students, and they form a part of the regular curriculum  of exercises,--as much so as the recitations in geography, grammar, or  Greek. The good effect of the experiments, as shown in improved scholarship  as well as increased bodily vigor, in the institutions where the plan has  been tried, will, it is hoped, lead to its universal adoption. We should  then hear less frequently of parents being obliged to withdraw their  children from school, because they become exhausted {34} or, perchance,  have lost their health from intense and protracted mental application.    [Sidenote: 24. The result of gymnastics in our colleges and other  institutions of learning?]    24. Were gymnastics more common in our educational institutions we should  not so often witness the sad spectacle of young men and women leaving our  colleges and seminaries, with finished educations it may be, but with  constitutions so impaired, that the life which should be devoted to the  accomplishment of noble purposes must be spent in search of health. Spinal  curvatures, which, according to the experience of physicians, are now  extremely frequent, especially among ladies, would give place to the steady  gait and erect carriage which God designed his human creatures should  maintain.    25. All the exercises necessary for the proper development of the body may  be obtained from the use of a few simple contrivances that every one can  have at home, at little cost--less by far than is spent for useless toys.  Many of these may be made available in the parlor or chamber, though all  exercises are far more useful in the open air. A small portion of the day  thus spent will afford agreeable recreation as well as useful exercise. The  Indian club, the wand, the ring, and the dumb-bells answer ordinary  purposes very well. Illustrations are here introduced of a few simple  contrivances that may be useful for general exercises, and are specially  suitable for persons with _weak spines_, or with spines that are the  subject of lateral curvature.    26.
