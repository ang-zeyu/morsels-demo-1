Presently the spectators were startled with a  deafening laugh, not unlike that of the hyena, but even louder and  more weird-like. On turning around, they saw the Cockatoo suddenly  transformed into a totally different bird, his whole frame literally  blazing with excitement, his crest flung forward to the fullest extent,  and repeatedly spread and closed like the fan of an angry Spanish lady,  every feather standing on end and his eyes sparkling with fury while he  volleyed forth the sounds which had so startled them. The cause of this  excitement was the presence of two children who had come to look at the  bird, and whom he recognized as having formerly excited his ire. He  always objected to children, and being naturally irritable from the  effect of moulting, his temper became uncontrollable.    The Cockatoo is not gifted with the wonderful imitating powers of the  true Parrot, and on account of its deafening cries is not an agreeable  inhabitant of the house. It is in a state of nature that the birds are  most interesting. They are not shy or wary, are very vociferous, and,  like the common Parrots, rise up in bodies toward sunset and fly  two-and-two to their resting places. It is a superb sight to see  thousands of these beautiful creatures flying overhead, low enough to  permit a full view of their feathered mantles.     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad.

This, one of the most beautiful of the Partridges, is much larger  and handsomer than Bob White, though perhaps not so interesting or  attractive as a game bird. The pretty plumes are noticeable in the chick  just from the egg, in the form of a little tuft of down, and their  growth is gradual until the perfect plumage of the adult is obtained.    The Mountain Partridge is found breeding along the Pacific coast region  from California north into Washington. According to the observer  Emerson, it is found nesting in the higher mountain ranges, not below  four thousand feet. In some portions of Oregon it is very abundant, and  would be sought for by the sportsman with great assiduity were the  regions that it inhabits more accessible. As it is, it is not only hard  to find but very difficult to secure when once flushed, hiding easily  from the dogs, who become discouraged by repeated unsuccessful efforts  to find it.    The Mountain Partridge deposits its eggs on the ground, on a bed of  dead leaves, under a bush or tuft of grass or weeds. Its habits are  exceedingly like those of the Bob White. From six to twelve eggs are  laid of a cream color, with a reddish tint. They have been described as  miniatures of those of the Ruffed Grouse, only distinguishable by their  smaller size.    This Partridge will usually run before the dog, is flushed only with  much trouble, and often takes to the trees after being started.  California is comparatively destitute of wood except on inaccessible  mountain sites and canons, localities preferred by these birds. It is  not known to descend to the valleys.           *       *       *       *       *    BOB WHITE.        \"I own the country here about,\" says Bob White;      \"At early morn I gayly shout, I'm Bob White!

They are working so hard through the long summer day,      Gathering grasses and hair and hay.        They are so happy, for soon they will hear      The eager \"Peep, peep!\" of their babies so dear.      Dear mother, gather them safe 'neath each wing;      Kind father, hasten, for food you must bring.        Now mother and father will teach them to fly:      \"Come, timid birdies; come, try; come, try.      Fly out in the Greenwood, dear birdies, with me;      Then back to the nest in the dear old tree.\"      Mrs. Wren was busy that morning. She had been away all winter, among the  trees in the south, but was back in the old neighborhood now, getting  her house in order for the summer season.    Mr. Wren, with a number of other gentlemen Wrens, had arrived some weeks  before and had been kept pretty busy looking about for a desirable  apartment in which to set up housekeeping. Several had struck him as  being just the thing, among them a gourd which one thoughtful family had  set for a Chickadee. \"I'll fetch some sticks and straws and put a few in  each house,\" said he, with the greediness of his kind, \"so the other  birds will think it is rented. Mrs. Wren is so particular maybe none of  them will suit her. She always wants something better than Mrs. John  Wren, her cousin, and I notice Mr. John looking about in this  neighborhood, too.\"    In the low bushes and shrubbery Mr. Wren flitted from day to day,  keeping his eye on one apartment, especially, which he considered  particularly fine.    \"I do wish she would hurry up,\" he thought, anxious for Mrs. Wren to  arrive. \"It takes a female so long to get ready to go anywhere. I saw an  impudent Blue Jay around here this morning and he may take a fancy to  that apartment up there. I wouldn't like to tackle him, and so, to let  him see that it is rented, I'll fetch a few more straws,\" and off Mr.  Wren flew, returning in a very little while with his bill full.    Well, about the first of April Mrs. Wren arrived, quite tired with her  journey, but as sprightly and talkative as ever. Mr. Wren greeted her  with one of his loudest songs, and they flew about chattering and  singing for quite a while.    \"I suppose,\" said she, resting at length on the limb of a maple tree,  \"that you have been flying about, eating and drinking and talking with  the other Mr. Wrens, and not looking for a house at all. That is the  way with your sex generally, when there is any work to be done.\"    \"Oh, it is?\" said Mr. Wren, his feathers ruffled in a minute. \"That's my  reward for staying about this house and the grounds all the time, is it?  My whole time has been taken up in house hunting, let me tell you, Mrs.  Wren, and in keeping my eye on one particular apartment which is to let  up there.\"    \"Where?\" chirped Mrs. Wren, her bright eyes traveling up and down the  side of the house before them. \"I don't see a box or crevice anywhere.\"    \"Oh, you don't?\" said Mr. Wren, mimicking her tone and air, \"not a single  box or crevice anywhere. Who said anything about either, I'd like to  know?\"    \"Why, you did, Mr. Wren,\" said Mrs. Jenny, every feather on top of her  head standing on end. \"You did, as plain as could be.\"    \"I said nothing of the sort,\" retorted Mr. Wren, \"I never mentioned a  box or crevice once.\"    \"Then what did you say,\" returned Mrs. Wren with a little cackling sort  of a laugh, \"what kind of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#5)"],[1,"------      WATER CONSUMED BY THE HORSE       |WATER VOIDED BY THE HORSE          IN  24 HOURS.               |      IN  24 HOURS.    ------------------+---------------+--------------------+------------                      |  lbs.   oz.   |                    |  lbs.   oz.

Nearly all  this loss of carbon and hydrogen escaped by respiration, while most of  the water, oxygen, nitrogen, and salts, passed off in perspiration. In  further illustration of the subject of respiration, Liebig says, \"from  the accurate determination of the quantity of carbon daily taken into  the system in the food, as well as of that proportion of it which passes  out of the body in the f[oe]ces and urine, _unburned_, that is, in some  form uncombined with oxygen, it appears that an adult taking moderate  exercise, consumes 13.9 oz. of carbon daily.\" The foregoing are facts in  the animal economy, capable of vast practical bearing in the management  of our domestic animals. But before following out these principles to  their application, let us briefly examine      The Effects of Respiration.    We have seen from the experiment of Boussingault, that there is a loss  of 6 lbs. 6 oz. of carbon, and 8 oz. 3 dwt. of hydrogen in the food of  the horse, and something less in that of the cow, every 24 hours, which  has not been left in the system, nor has it escaped by the evacuations.  What has become of so large an amount of solid matter? It has escaped  through the lungs and been converted into air. The carbon and hydrogen  of the food have undergone those various transformations which are  peculiar to the animal economy, digestion, assimilation, &c., which it  is not necessary, nor will our limits permit us here to explain; and  they appear at last in the veinous blood, which in the course of its  circulation is brought into the cells of the lungs. The air inhaled is  sent through every part of their innumerable meshes, and is there  separated from the blood, only by the delicate tissues or membranes  which enclose it. A portion of the carbon and hydrogen escapes from the  blood into the air-cells, and at the instant of their contact with the  air, they affect a chemical union with its oxygen, forming carbonic acid  and the vapor of water, which is then expired, and a fresh supply of  oxygen is inhaled. This operation is again repeated, through every  successive moment of animal existence.    Besides other purposes which it is probably designed to subserve, but  which have hitherto eluded the keenest research of chemical physiology,  one obvious result of respiration is, the elevation of the temperature  of the animal system. By the ever-operating laws of nature, this  chemical union of two bodies in the formation of a third, disengages  latent heat, which taking place in contact with the blood, is by it  diffused throughout the whole frame. The effect is precisely analogous  to the combustion of fuel, oils, &c., in the open air.      Perspiration    Is the counteracting agent which modifies this result, and prevents the  injurious effects, which, under exposure to great external heat, would  ensure certain destruction. And this too, it will have been seen, is  provided at the expense of the animal food. When from excessive heat,  caused by violent exercise or otherwise, by which respiration is  accelerated and the animal temperature becomes elevated, the papillae of  the skin pour the limpid fluid through their innumerable ducts, which in  its conversion into vapor, seize upon the animal heat and remove it from  the system, producing that delicious coolness so grateful to the  laboring man and beast in a sultry summer's day. These two opposing  principles, like the antagonistic operations of the regulator in  mechanics, keep up a perfect balance in the vital machine, and enable  that entire division of the animal creation, distinguished as  warm-blooded, including man and the brute, all the feathered tribes, the  whale, the seal, the walrus, &c., to maintain an equilibrium of  temperature, whether under the equator or the poles; on the peaks of  Chimborazo, the burning sands of Zahara, or plunged in the depths of the  Arctic Ocean.    The connection between the size of the lungs, and the aptitude of  animals to fatten, will be more apparent from the fact, that the carbon  and hydrogen which are abstracted, constitute two of the only three  elements of fat. The larger size, the fuller play, and the greater  activity of the lungs, by exhausting more of the materials of fat, must  necessarily diminish its formation in the animal system; unless it "]]]
