[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#5)"],[1,"fruits, mysticism  can give a very good account of itself to the Marthas as well as the  Marys of this world.    Sect. 4. THE GERMAN MYSTICS AS GUIDES TO HOLINESS    THIS little volume is a contribution to a \"Library of Devotion,\" and  in the body of the work the reader will be seldom troubled by any  abstruse philosophising. I have thought it necessary to give, in  this Introduction, a short account of Eckhart's system, but the  extracts which follow are taken mainly from his successors, in whom  the speculative tendency is weaker and less original, while the  religious element is stronger and more attractive. It is, after all,  as guides to holiness that these mystics are chiefly important to  us. This side of their life's work can never be out of date, for the  deeper currents of human nature change but little; the language of  the heart is readily understood everywhere and at all times. The  differences between Catholic and Protestant are hardly felt in the  keen air of these high summits. It was Luther himself who discovered  the \"Theologia Germanica\" and said of it that, \"next to the Bible  and St Augustine, no book hath ever come into my hands whence I have  learnt or would wish to learn more of what God and Christ and man  and all things are. I thank God that I have heard and found my God  in the German tongue, as I have not yet found Him in Latin, Greek,  or Hebrew.\" The theology of these mystics takes us straight back to  the Johannine doctrine of Christ as the all-pervading Word of God,  by whom all things were made and in whom all things hold together.  He is not far from any one of us if we will but seek Him where He is  to be found--in the innermost sanctuary of our personal life. In  personal religion this means that no part of revelation is to be  regarded as past, isolated, or external. \"We should mark and know of  a very truth,\" says the author of the \"Theologia Germanica,\" \"that  all manner of virtue and goodness, and even the eternal Good which  is God Himself, can never make a man virtuous, good, or happy, so  long as it is outside the soul.\" In the same spirit Jacob Bhme, 250  years later, says: \"If the sacrifice of Christ is to avail for me,  it must be wrought in me.\" Or, as his English admirer, William Law,  puts it: \"Christ given for us is neither more nor less than Christ  given into us. He is in no other sense our full, perfect, and  sufficient Atonement than as His nature and spirit are born and  formed in us.\" The whole process of redemption must in a sense be  reenacted in the inner life of every Christian. And as Christ  emptied Himself for our sakes, so must we empty ourselves of all  self-seeking. \"When the creature claimeth for its own anything good,  such as life, knowledge, or power, and in short whatever we commonly  call good, as if it were that, or possessed that--it goeth astray.\"  Sin is nothing else but self-assertion, self-will. \"Be assured,\"  says the \"Theologia Germanica,\" \"that he who helpeth a man to his  own will, helpeth him to the worst that he can.\" He, therefore, who  is \"simply and wholly bereft of self\" is delivered from sin, and God  alone reigns in his inmost soul. Concerning the highest part or  faculty of the soul, the author of this little treatise follows  Eckhart, but cautiously. \"The True Light,\" he says, \"is that eternal  Light which is God; or else it is a created light, but yet Divine,  which is called grace.\" In either case, \"where God dwells in a godly  man, in such a man somewhat appertaineth to God which is His own,  and belongs to Him only and not to the creature.\" This doctrine of  divine immanence, for which there is ample warrant in the New  Testament, is the real kernel of German mysticism. It is a doctrine  which, when rightly used, may make this world a foretaste of heaven,  but alas! the \"False Light\" is always trying to counterfeit the  true. In the imitation of the suffering life of Christ lies the only  means of escaping the deceptions of the Evil One. \"The False Light  dreameth itself to be God, and sinless\"; but \"none is without sin;  if any is without consciousness of sin, he must be either Christ or  the Evil Spirit.\"    Very characteristic is the teaching of all these writers about  rewards and punishments. Without in any way impugning the Church  doctrine of future retribution, they yet agree with Benjamin  Whichcote, the Cambridge Platonist, that \"heaven is first a temper,  then a place\"; while of hell there is much to recall the noble  sentence of Juliana of Norwich, the fourteenth-century visionary,  \"to me was showed no harder hell than sin.\" \"Nothing burneth in hell  but self-will,\" is a saying in the \"Theologia Germanica.\"[24] They  insist that the difference between heaven and hell is not that one  is a place of enjoyment, the other of torment; it is that in the one  we are with Christ, in the other without Him. \"The Christlike life  is not chosen,\" to quote the \"Theologia Germanica\" once more, \"in  order to serve any end, or to get anything by it, but for love of  its nobleness, and because God loveth and esteemeth it so highly. He  who doth not take it up for love, hath none of it at all; he may  dream indeed that he hath put it on, but he is deceived. Christ did  not lead such a life as this for the sake of reward, but out of  love, and love maketh such a life light, and taketh away all its  hardships, so that it becometh sweet and is gladly endured.\" The  truly religious man is always more concerned about what God will do  in him than what He will do to him; in his intense desire for the  purification of his motives he almost wishes that heaven and hell  were blotted out, that he might serve God for Himself alone.    Sect. 5. WRITERS OF THE SCHOOL OF ECKHART--TAULER    Such are the main characteristics of the religious teachings which  we find in the German mystics. Among the successors of Eckhart, from  whose writings the following extracts are taken, the most notable  names are those of Tauler, Suso, and Ruysbroek. From Tauler I have  taken very little, because a volume of selections from his sermons  has already appeared in this series.[25] Accordingly, it will only  be necessary to mention a very few facts about his life.    John Tauler was born at Strassburg about 1300, and studied at the  Dominican convents of Strassburg and Cologne. At both places he  doubtless heard the sermons of Eckhart. In 1329 the great interdict  began at Strassburg, and was stoutly resisted by many of the clergy.  It is a disputed point whether Tauler himself obeyed the Papal  decree or not. His uneventful life, which was devoted to study,  preaching, and pastoral work, came to an end in 1361. Like Eckhart,  he had a favourite \"spiritual daughter,\" Margaret Ebner, who won a  great reputation as a visionary.    Sect. 6. SUSO    Henry Suso was born in 1295 and died in 1365. His autobiography was  published not long before his death. He is the poet of the band. The  romance of saintship is depicted by him with a strange vividness  which alternately attracts and repels, or even disgusts, the modern  reader. The whole-hearted devotion of the \"Servitor\" to the \"Divine  Wisdom,\" the tender beauty of the visions and conversations, and the  occasional naveté of the narrative, which shows that the saint  remained very human throughout, make Suso's books delightful  reading; but the accounts of the horrible macerations to which he  subjected himself for many years shock our moral sense almost as  much as our sensibilities; we do not now believe that God takes  pleasure in sufferings inflicted in His honour. Moreover, the erotic  symbolism of the visions is occasionally unpleasant: we are no  longer in the company of such sane and healthy people as Eckhart and  Tauler. The half-sensuous pleasure of ecstasy was evidently a  temptation to Suso, and the violent alternations of rapture and  misery which he experienced suggest a neurotic and ill-balanced  temperament.[26]    On this subject--the pathological side of mysticism--a few remarks  will not be out of place, for there has been much discussion of it  lately. A great deal of nonsense has been written on the connexion  between religion and neuroticism. To quote Professor James' vigorous  protest, \"medical materialism finishes up St Paul by calling his  vision on the road to Damascus a discharging lesion of the occipital  cortex, he being an epileptic. It snuffs out St Teresa as an  hysteric, St Francis of Assisi as an hereditary degenerate. George  Fox's discontent with the shams of his age, and his pining for  spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a disordered colon.  Carlyle's organ-tones of misery it accounts for by a gastro-duodenal  catarrh. All such mental over-tensions, it says, are, when you come  to the bottom of the matter, mere affairs of diathesis  (auto-intoxications most probably), due to the perverted action of  various glands which physiology will yet discover.\"[27] Now, even if  it were true that most religious geniuses, like most other geniuses,  have been \"psychopaths\" of one kind or another, this fact in no way  disposes of the value of their intuitions and experiences. Nearly  all the great benefactors of humanity have been persons of  one-sided, and therefore ill-balanced, characters. Even Maudsley  admits that \"Nature may find an incomplete mind a more suitable  instrument for a particular purpose. It is the work that is done,  and the quality in the worker by which it is done, that is alone of  moment; and it may be no great matter from a cosmical standpoint, if  in other qualities of character he (the genius) was singularly  defective.\"[28] Except in the character of our Lord Himself, there  are visible imperfections in the record of every great saint; but  that is no reason for allowing such traces of human infirmity to  discredit what is pure and good in their work. More particularly, it  would be a great pity to let our minds dwell on the favourite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#5)"],[1,"  premises, but he and I were old friends, and he seemed very glad to see  me when I came on the ground on this eventful night. Sarah was watching,  and when I made the signal she opened the window and threw out her ready  prepared bundle. Then my man and I set the ladder and she came safely  to the ground. A moment more and we would have stolen away, when, as ill  luck would have it, the ladder fell with a great crash, and the infernal  dog, that a moment before seemed almost in our confidence, set up a howl  and then barked loud enough to wake the dead.    Forthwith issued from the house old Scheimer, two of his sons and his  hired guard--a half dozen in all. There was a time then. The girl was  instantly seized and taken into the house. Then all hands fell upon us  two, and though I and my man fought our best they managed to pound us  nearly to death. The dog, too, in revenge no doubt for the scare the  ladder had given him, or perhaps to show his loyalty to his master,  assisted in routing us, and put in a bite where he could. It is a wonder  we were not killed. Sarah, meanwhile, was calling out from the house,  and imploring them not to murder us. How we ever got away I hardly know  now, but presently we found ourselves in the road running for our lives,  and running also for the carriage we had concealed in the woods, half  a mile above. We reached it, and hastily unhitching and getting in we  drove rapidly for the bridge crossing over to Belvidere. That beautiful  August night had very few charms for us. It would have been different  indeed if I had succeeded in securing my Sarah; and to think of having  the prize in my very grasp, and the losing all!    We reached the hotel in Belvidere at about half-past two o'clock in  the morning, wearied, worn, bruised and disheartened. My man had not  suffered nearly as severely as I had; the bulk of their blows fell upon  me, and I had the sorest body and the worst looking face I had ever  exhibited. I rested one day and then hurried on to New York. Of course,  I had no means of knowing the feelings or condition of the loved girl  from whom I had been so suddenly and so violently parted. I only learned  from an Easton man whom I knew and whom I met in the city, that \"Sarah  Scheimer was sick\"--that was all; the man said he did'nt know the family  very well, but he had heard that Miss Scheimer had been \"out of her  head, if not downright crazy.\"    Crazy indeed! How mad and how miserable that poor girl was made by her  own family, I did not know till months afterward, and then I had the  terrible story from her own lips. It seems that when her father and his  gang returned from pursuing me, as they did a little way up the road  towards Belvidere, they found her almost frantic. They locked her up in  her room that night with no one to say so much as a kind word to her.  How she passed that night, after the scenes she had witnessed, and the  abuse with which her father and brothers had loaded her before they  thrust her into her prison, may be imagined. The next day she was  wrought up to a frenzy. Her parents pronounced her insane, and called in  a Dutch doctor who examined her and said she was \"bewitched!\" And this  is the remedy he proposed as a cure; he advised that she should be  soundly flogged, and the devil whipped out of her. Her family, intensely  angered at her for the trouble she had made them, or rather had caused  them to make for themselves, were only too glad to accept the advice.  The old man and two sons carried a sore bruise or two apiece they got  from me the night before, and seized the opportunity to pay them off  upon her. So they stripped her bare, and flogged her till her back was a  mass of welts and cuts, and then put her to bed. That bed she never left  for two months, and then came out the shadow of her former self. But the  Dutch doctor declared that the devil was whipped out of her, and that  she was entirely cured. A few months afterward the family had the best  of reasons for believing that they had whipped the devil into her,  instead of out of her.    After staying in New York a few days, I went to Dover, N.H., where I had  some acquaintances, and where I hoped to get into a medical practice,  which, with the help of my friends, I did very soon. I lived quietly in  that place all winter, earning a good living and laying by some money.  During the whole time I never heard a word from Sarah. I wrote at least  fifty letters to her, but as I learned afterward, and, indeed, surmised  at the time, every one of them was intercepted by her father or  brothers, and she did not know where I was and so could not write to me.  I left Dover in May and went down to New York. I had some business  there which was soon transacted, and early in June I went over to New  Jersey--to Oxford, a small place near Belvidere.    This place I meant to make my base of operations for the new campaign I  had been planning all winter. I \"put up\" at a public house kept by a man  who was known in the region round about as the \"Boston Yankee,\" for he  migrated from Boston to New Jersey and was doing a thriving business  at hotel keeping in Oxford. What a thorough good-fellow he was will  presently appear. I had been in the hotel four days and had become  pretty intimate with the landlord before I ventured to make inquiries  about what I was most anxious to learn; but finally I asked him if he  knew the Scheimers over the river? He looked at me in a very comical  way, and then broke out:    \"Well, I declare, I thought I knew you, you're the chap that tried to  run away with old Scheimer's daughter Sarah, last August; and you're  down here to get her this time, if you can.\"    I owned up to my identity, but warned Boston Yankee that if he told any  one who I was, or that I was about there, I'd blow his brains out.    \"You keep cool,\" said he, \"don't you be uneasy; I'm your friend and the  gal's friend, and I'll help you both all I can; and if you want to carry  off Sarah Scheimer and marry her, I'll tell you how to work it. You see  she has been watched as closely as possible all winter, ever since she  got well, for she was crazy-like, awhile. Well, you could'n't get nearer  to her, first off, than you could to the North Pole; but do you remember  Mary Smith who was servant gal, there when you boarded with Scheimer?\" I  remembered the girl well and told him so, and he continued: \"Well, I saw  her the other day, and she told me she was living in Easton, and where  she could be found; now, I'll give you full directions and do you take  my horse and buggy to-morrow morning early and go down and see her, and  get her to go over and let Sarah know that you're round; meantime I'll  keep dark; I know my business and you know yours.\"    I need not say how overjoyed I was to find this new and most unexpected  friend, and how gratefully I accepted his offer. He gave me the street,  house and number where Mary Smith lived and during the evening we  planned together exactly how the whole affair was to be managed, from  beginning to end. I went to bed, but could scarcely sleep; and all night  long I was agitated by alternate hopes and fears for the success of the  scheme of to-morrow.        CHAPTER IV. SUCCESS WITH SARAH.    MARY SMITH AS A CONFEDERATE--THE PLOT--WAITING IN THE WOODS--THE  SPY OUTWITTED--SARAH SECURED--THE PURSUERS BAFFLED--NIGHT ON THE  ROAD--EFFORTS TO GET MARRIED--THE \"OLD OFFENDER\" MARRIED AT LAST--A  CONSTABLE AFTER SARAH--HE GIVES IT UP--AN ALE ORGIE--RETURN TO \"BOSTON  YANKEE'S\"--A HOME IN GOSHEN.        It was Saturday morning, and after an early breakfast I was on the road  with Boston Yankee's fast horse; towards Easton. On my arrival there I  had no difficulty in finding Mary Smith, who recognized me at once, and  was very glad to see me. She knew I had come there to learn something  about Sarah; she had seen her only a week ago; she was well again, and  the girls had talked together about me. This was pleasant to hear, and  I at once proposed to Mary to go to Scheimer's and tell Sarah that I  was there; I would give her ten dollars if she would go. \"O! she would  gladly serve us both for nothing.\"    So she made herself ready, got into the buggy, and we started for  Scheimer's. When we were well on the road I said to her:    \"Now, Mary, attend carefully to what I say: you will need to be very  cautious in breaking the news to Sarah that I am here; she has already  suffered a great deal on my account, and may be very timid about my  being in the neighborhood; but if she still loves me as you say she  does, she will run any risk to see me, and, if I know her, she will be  glad to go away with me. Now, this is what you must do; you must see her  alone and tell her my plan; here, take this diamond ring; she knows it  well; manage to let her see it on your finger; then tell her that if  she is willing to leave home and marry me, I will be in the woods half a  mile above her house to-morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock, with a horse  and buggy ready to carry her to Belvidere. If she will not, or dare not  come, give her the ring, and tell her we part, good friends, forever.\"    It was a beautiful afternoon as we drove along the road. We talked about  Sarah and old times, and I made her repeat my instructions over and  over again and she promised to convey every word to Sarah. We neared  Scheimer's house about six o'clock, and when we were a little way from  there I told Mary to get out, so as to excite no suspicions as to who I  was; she did so, and I waited till I saw her go into the house, and then  drove rapidly by towards the Belvidere bridge, and was safely at Oxford  by nightfall. I told my friend, the landlord, what I had done, and he  said that everything was well planned. He also promised to go with me  next day to assist me if necessary, and, said he:    \"If everything is all right, do you carry off the girl and I'll walk  up to Belvidere; but don't"]]]
