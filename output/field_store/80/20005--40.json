On the other hand, the English-speaking  colonies had their allegiance tested to the uttermost. The proud  Anglo-Celtic stock is not accustomed to be humbled, and yet they found  themselves through the action of the home Government converted into  members of a beaten race. It was very well for the citizen of London to  console his wounded pride by the thought that he had done a magnanimous  action, but it was different with the British colonist of Durban or Cape  Town, who by no act of his own, and without any voice in the settlement,  found himself humiliated before his Dutch neighbour. An ugly feeling of  resentment was left behind, which might perhaps have passed away had the  Transvaal accepted the settlement in the spirit in which it was meant,  but which grew more and more dangerous as during eighteen years our  people saw, or thought that they saw, that one concession led always  to a fresh demand, and that the Dutch republics aimed not merely at  equality, but at dominance in South Africa. Professor Bryce, a friendly  critic, after a personal examination of the country and the question,  has left it upon record that the Boers saw neither generosity nor  humanity in our conduct, but only fear. An outspoken race, they conveyed  their feelings to their neighbours. Can it be wondered at that South  Africa has been in a ferment ever since, and that the British Africander  has yearned with an intensity of feeling unknown in England for the hour  of revenge?    The Government of the Transvaal after the war was left in the hands of a  triumvirate, but after one year Kruger became President, an office which  he continued to hold for eighteen years. His career as ruler vindicates  the wisdom of that wise but unwritten provision of the American  Constitution by which there is a limit to the tenure of this office.  Continued rule for half a generation must turn a man into an autocrat.  The old President has said himself, in his homely but shrewd way, that  when one gets a good ox to lead the team it is a pity to change him.  If a good ox, however, is left to choose his own direction without  guidance, he may draw his wagon into trouble.    During three years the little State showed signs of a tumultuous  activity. Considering that it was as large as France and that the  population could not have been more than 50,000, one would have thought  that they might have found room without any inconvenient crowding.  But the burghers passed beyond their borders in every direction. The  President cried aloud that he had been shut up in a kraal, and he  proceeded to find ways out of it. A great trek was projected for the  north, but fortunately it miscarried. To the east they raided Zululand,  and succeeded, in defiance of the British settlement of that country,  in tearing away one third of it and adding it to the Transvaal. To  the west, with no regard to the three-year-old treaty, they invaded  Bechuanaland, and set up the two new republics of Goshen and Stellaland.  So outrageous were these proceedings that Great Britain was forced  to fit out in 1884 a new expedition under Sir Charles Warren for the  purpose of turning these freebooters out of the country. It may be  asked, why should these men be called freebooters if the founders of  Rhodesia were pioneers? The answer is that the Transvaal was limited  by treaty to certain boundaries which these men transgressed, while no  pledges were broken when the British power expanded to the north. The  upshot of these trespasses was the scene upon which every drama of South  Africa rings down. Once more the purse was drawn from the pocket of  the unhappy taxpayer, and a million or so was paid out to defray the  expenses of the police force necessary to keep these treaty-breakers in  order. Let this be borne in mind when we assess the moral and material  damage done to the Transvaal by that ill-conceived and foolish  enterprise, the Jameson Raid.    In 1884 a deputation from the Transvaal visited England, and at their  solicitation the clumsy Treaty of Pretoria was altered into the still  more clumsy Convention of London. The changes in the provisions were all  in favour of the Boers, and a second successful war could hardly have  given them more than Lord Derby handed them in time of peace. Their  style was altered from the Transvaal to the South African Republic, a  change which was ominously suggestive of expansion in the future. The  control of Great Britain over their foreign policy was also relaxed,  though a power of veto was retained. But the most important thing of  all, and the fruitful cause of future trouble, lay in an omission. A  suzerainty is a vague term, but in politics, as in theology, the more  nebulous a thing is the more does it excite the imagination and the  passions of men. This suzerainty was declared in the preamble of the  first treaty, and no mention of it was made in the second. Was it  thereby abrogated or was it not? The British contention was that only  the articles were changed, and that the preamble continued to hold good  for both treaties. They pointed out that not only the suzerainty, but  also the independence, of the Transvaal was proclaimed in that preamble,  and that if one lapsed the other must do so also. On the other hand,  the Boers pointed to the fact that there was actually a preamble to the  second Convention, which would seem, therefore, to have taken the place  of the first. The point is so technical that it appears to be eminently  one of those questions which might with propriety have been submitted to  the decision of a board of foreign jurists--or possibly to the Supreme  Court of the United States. If the decision had been given against Great  Britain, we might have accepted it in a chastened spirit as a fitting  punishment for the carelessness of the representative who failed to  make our meaning intelligible. Carlyle has said that a political mistake  always ends in a broken head for somebody. Unfortunately the somebody is  usually somebody else. We have read the story of the political mistakes.  Only too soon we shall come to the broken heads.    This, then, is a synopsis of what had occurred up to the signing of  the Convention, which finally established, or failed to establish, the  position of the South African Republic. We must now leave the larger  questions, and descend to the internal affairs of that small State, and  especially to that train of events which has stirred the mind of our  people more than anything since the Indian Mutiny.        CHAPTER 2. THE CAUSE OF QUARREL.    There might almost seem to be some subtle connection between the  barrenness and worthlessness of a surface and the value of the minerals  which lie beneath it. The craggy mountains of Western America, the arid  plains of West Australia, the ice-bound gorges of the Klondyke, and the  bare slopes of the Witwatersrand veld--these are the lids which cover  the great treasure chests of the world.    Gold had been known to exist in the Transvaal before, but it was only in  1886 that it was realised that the deposits which lie some thirty miles  south of the capital are of a very extraordinary and valuable nature.  The proportion of gold in the quartz is not particularly high, nor are  the veins of a remarkable thickness, but the peculiarity of the Rand  mines lies in the fact that throughout this 'banket' formation the metal  is so uniformly distributed that the enterprise can claim a certainty  which is not usually associated with the industry. It is quarrying  rather than mining. Add to this that the reefs which were originally  worked as outcrops have now been traced to enormous depths, and present  the same features as those at the surface. A conservative estimate of  the value of the gold has placed it at seven hundred millions of pounds.    Such a discovery produced the inevitable effect. A great number of  adventurers flocked into the country, some desirable and some very much  the reverse. There were circumstances, however, which kept away  the rowdy and desperado element who usually make for a newly opened  goldfield. It was not a class of mining which encouraged the individual  adventurer. There were none of those nuggets which gleamed through  the mud of the dollies at Ballarat, or recompensed the forty-niners in  California for all their travels and their toils. It was a field for  elaborate machinery, which could only be provided by capital. Managers,  engineers, miners, technical experts, and the tradesmen and middlemen  who live upon them, these were the Uitlanders, drawn from all the races  under the sun, but with the Anglo-Celtic vastly predominant. The best  engineers were American, the best miners were Cornish, the best managers  were English, the money to run the mines was largely subscribed in  England. As time went on, however, the German and French interests  became more extensive, until their joint holdings are now probably as  heavy as those of the British. Soon the population of the mining centres  became greater than that of the whole Boer community, and consisted  mainly of men in the prime of life--men, too, of exceptional  intelligence and energy.    The situation was an extraordinary one. I have already attempted to  bring the problem home to an American by suggesting that the Dutch  of New York had trekked west and founded an anti-American and highly  unprogressive State. To carry out the analogy we will now suppose that  that State was California, that the gold of that State attracted a  large inrush of American citizens, who came to outnumber the original  inhabitants, that these citizens were heavily taxed and badly used, and  that they deafened Washington with their outcry about their injuries.  That would be a fair parallel to the relations between the Transvaal,  the Uitlanders, and the British Government.

And then, I wonder  if it is safe to let him go, hating me? Oh, well!\" He shrugged his  narrow shoulders. \"I seldom leave the laboratory, and certainly nothing  can harm me here.\" He touched the death-projector significantly.    Hale made a mental decision. \"I must find out how the damned thing works  and put it out of commission.\"           *       *       *       *       *    With this determination uppermost in his mind, he assumed a more intense  interest in the strange laboratory. For the next two days, he assisted  Sir Basil so assiduously that he learned much about the operation of the  life-machine. And gradually he stopped being horrified as the  fascination of producing life in the laboratory grew upon him.    After he had assisted the scientist in building living organisms from  basic elements, he ceased to cringe when he remembered that perhaps it  was true that Ana was created in the mysterious life-machine.    Once the scientist declared, \"She is untainted with inheritance. She is  the perfect mate that I called into life so that before I pass from the  flesh I may taste that one human emotion I've never experienced--love.\"    That very night Hale kept a secret tryst with Ana after the village  slept. Sweet, virginal Ana, who knew less of the world than a civilized  child of twelve--what a sensation she would create in New York with her  beauty, her culture, her natural fascination! With her in his arms and  an orange tropical moon hanging low in the hot, black sky, he ceased to  care that she had no ancestors, for now his one passionate desire was to  save her from Sir Basil and to hold her forever for himself.    He might have been content to go on like this for months, tampering with  creation in the day time, courting Ana in secret at night, had not Unani  Assu come back for revenge.           *       *       *       *       *    On the fourth night after Unani Assu had disappeared into the jungle,  Hale went to the _igarape_ to meet Ana. He had gone only half the  distance when he encountered her, running frantically up the path toward  him.    \"Hale!\" she gasped, falling into his opened arms, where she lay panting  and exhausted.    Hale gently patted the long braids, shimmering in silver tangles under  the moonlight, and, crushing the soft little trembling body close, he  murmured:    \"What's the matter, darling?\"    She dug her face deeper into the bend of his arm. \"Oh, Hale! I saw Unani  Assu a few minutes ago.\" For several moments she was unable to go on,  for sudden sobs cut off her breath. \"It's terrible, Hale, what Aimu did  to his hands and feet, but what Unani's going to do to Aimu is still  more terrible.\"    Hale placed his hand gently under her chin and tilted up her small,  pale, tear-drenched face.    \"Be calm, Ana, and tell me plainly.\"    Still clinging to him, she went on. \"He told me that Aimu is a devil,  Hale. He showed me his hands and asked me if I could ever get used to  them and be--his squaw.\" The round gold breastplates and the necklace of  painted seeds clinked together over her panting bosom. \"I told him about  you, Hale. And then he seemed to go mad. He said he'd kill Aimu  to-night.\"    \"But, Ana! Why did he let you go, knowing that you would give the  alarm?\"    \"He didn't let me go.\" Her petaled lips parted in a faint smile. \"I  escaped. Unani Assu tied me to a tree by the _igarape_. Because he  doesn't ... hate me, he could not bear to tie me too tightly.\"    \"Then he must be close to the laboratory now. If he breaks in upon  Aimu--oh, my God!\"    Hale remembered the death-projector. If Sir Basil were in danger of  attack, he would not hesitate to touch the waiting button that would  broadcast death throughout the world.    He seized Ana's little hand and cried out: \"Run, Ana! The only safe  place now is Aimu's laboratory. Run!\"           *       *       *       *       *    As they dashed on madly, Hale opened wide his nostrils to scent the  heavy, flower-laden air of the jungle. Any moment all this sweet, rich  life might vanish instantly. He had a horrible vision of a world devoid  of life, a world of bare rocks, dry sand, odorless, dead waters. For it  was life that greened the landscape, roughened the stones with moss and  lichen, thickened the ocean with ooze, and turned the dry sand into  loam--life that swarmed underfoot, overhead, all around!    And now, just as they reached the laboratory door, panting and frantic,  a hoarse shriek broke forth. Dragging Ana after him, Hale dashed  forward, conscious of two masculine voices raised in passion.    The door to the room where the life-machine performed its vile work was  locked. Hale pounded against it and called out to Sir Basil, but only  curses and the sound of tumbling bodies came from beyond the door.  Although originally the door had been thick and strong, the destructive  forces of the tropics had pitted and rotted the wood. A few blows of  Hale's shoulder broke it down.    Under the brilliant electric light, Sir Basil and Unani Assu were  fighting upon the blood-spattered floor. The struggle was uneven: the  scientist's emaciated body was no match for the splendid strength of the  young Indian.    \"Help Aimu!\" cried Ana, pushing Hale forward.    Aimu was being choked to death.    Hale acted fantastically but efficiently. Catching up a bottle of  ammonia, he moistened a handkerchief and clapped it against Unani Assu's  nose. Instantly the Indian choked, released Sir Basil, and fell back,  gasping for breath.    Hale thrust the handkerchief into his pocket.    \"Get out!\" he ordered Unani Assu. \"Quick!\" He threatened him with the  ammonia bottle.    But Unani Assu was not looking at the bottle. \"Aimu!\" he screamed,  pointing.           *       *       *       *       *    When Hale saw and understood, he leaped across the room to plant his  body in front of Ana; for Sir Basil was behind the life-machine,  reaching for the controls of the ray projector.    Suddenly, from behind Hale, a silver streak shot across the room. Sir  Basil groaned and sank to the floor of the laboratory.    A keen-bladed dissecting knife, thrown by Ana, stuck out from his left  breast.    Ana ran forward, sobbing wildly. \"Oh, Aimu! I'm sorry! I didn't mean for  it to strike you there. Only your hand, Aimu! I didn't want Hale to die,  Aimu. I didn't--oh!\"    She was on her knees by the scientist's side, his head held in her  slender arms.    \"He's breathing!\" she rejoiced. \"Some _masata_, Hale, quick!\"    Hale found a bottle of good brandy which he had contributed from his own  supplies. Soon Sir Basil gasped and opened his eyes. He stared about him  wildly, then gasped:    \"I'm dying, Hale Oakham! Quick, the life-machine, before my mind-electron  escapes.\"    He tried to pull his body up, but fell back, weak and panting.    Hale hesitated, looking doubtfully at Ana.    \"For God's sake, quick!\" screamed Sir Basil. \"I'm dying, I say! I must  have--rebirth. Lift me to the disintegrator. Hurry!...\" His voice  trailed off faintly.    \"He is dying,\" snapped Hale. \"We might as well try it.\" He jerked open  the door to the disintegrator. \"Here, Unani Assu! Lend a hand!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Instantly the Indian came forward, a peculiar, pleased expression on his  handsome face. In a moment, Sir Basil's body was inside, and the machine  began its weird humming, the humming that indicated the transformation  of a human body into dust.    \"Now!\" cried Unani Assu exultingly, going behind the machine. \"I have  helped him enough to understand that if one changes this--and this--and  this\"--he made some rapid adjustments on the machine--\"something that is  not pleasant will happen.\"    \"Stop!\" cried Hale. \"What did you change?\"    The Indian laughed mockingly. \"Wouldn't you like to know? But, yet, you  should not worry. You have no cause to love him, have you?\"    \"I can't be a traitor, Unani Assu! Arrange the machine as it was  originally, and I give you my word of honor than when Sir Basil comes  out, I'll wreck the damned thing beyond repair. See, Unani Assu? You and  I together will smash it.\"    The Indian folded his arms so that the repulsive things that should have  been hands were hidden.    \"It's too late now,\" he admitted, shaking his head. \"Yet I've done no  more to him than he did to me.\"    Hale went to the eye-piece in the machine and started to look inside.  Unani Assu stepped forward, tapped him on the shoulder, and, fingering  significantly the dissecting knife which he had picked up, said:    \"I am operating the machine. Will you sit over there by Ana and wait? It  won't be long. And, white stranger, remember this: I am your friend. I  am turned against none but our common enemy.\" He pointed significantly  to the machine.           *       *       *       *       *    Two hours passed, long, silent hours for the watchers in the laboratory.  Ana fell asleep, in a sweet, childish bundle upon the piled cushions,  her golden hair, still decorated with the red flowers which she always  wore, crushed and withered now. Several times Hale caught Unani Assu  gazing at her sadly, and his own look saddened when it rested on the  Indian's strong, outraged body.    The humming of the machine changed to a whistle. Placing his fingers on  his lips in a signal of quiet, Unani Assu whispered:    \"Let Ana sleep. She mustn't see this.\"    Opening a door in the machine, his handsome face lighted with a grim  smile, he whispered exultingly:    \"Watch!\"    A scuttling sound issued forth and then, half drunkenly, an enormous rat  tumbled out--one of those horrible rats with the hairless, humanlike  faces that had so frequently come from the life-machine.    Hale could not crush back the cry that issued from his throat.    \"Where is Sir Basil?\" he gasped.    \"There!\" cried the Indian, pointing to the kicking rat, which was fast  gaining strength.           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
