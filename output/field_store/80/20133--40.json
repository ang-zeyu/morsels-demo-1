Kant, Schelling, and Hegel,  again, made use of the concept of the Beautiful as a kind of  keystone or cornice for their respective philosophical edifices.  Aesthetics, then, came into being as the philosophy of the  Beautiful, and it may be asked why this philosophical aesthetics  does not suffice--why beauty should need for its understanding  also an aesthetics \"von unten.\"    The answer is not that no system of philosophy is universally  accepted, but that the general aesthetic theories have not, as  yet at least, succeeded in answering the plain questions of  \"the plain man\" in regard to concrete beauty.  Kant, indeed,  frankly denied that the explanation of concrete beauty, or  \"Doctrine of Taste,\" as he called it, was possible, while the  various definers of beauty as \"the union of the Real and the  Ideal\" \"the expression of the Ideal to Sense,\" have done no  more than he.  No one of these aesthetic systems, in spite of  volumes of so-called application of their principles to works  of art, has been able to furnish a criterion of beauty.  The  criticism of the generations is summed up in the mild remark  of Fechner, in his \"Vorschule der Aesthetik,\" to the effect  that the philosophical path leaves one in conceptions that,  by reason of their generality, do not well fit the particular  cases.  And so it was that empirical aesthetics arose, which  does not seek to answer those plain questions as to the  enjoyment of concrete beauty down to its simplest forms, to  which philosophical aesthetics had been inadequate.    But it is clear that neither has empirical aesthetics said  the last word concerning beauty.  Criticism is still in a  chaotic state that would be impossible if aesthetic theory  were firmly grounded.  This situation appears to me to be  due to the inherent inadequacy and inconclusiveness of  empirical aesthetics when it stands alone; the grounds of  this inadequacy I shall seek to establish in the following.    Granting that the aim of every aesthetics is to determine  the Nature of Beauty, and to explain our feelings about it,  we may say that the empirical treatments propose to do this  either by describing the aesthetic object and extracting the  essential elements of Beauty, or by describing the aesthetic  experience and extracting the essential elements of aesthetic  feeling, thereby indicating the elements of Beauty as those  which effect this feeling.    Now the bare description and analysis of beautiful objects  cannot, logically, yield any result; for the selection of  cases would have to be arbitrary, and would be at the mercy  of any objection.  To any one who should say, But this is  not beautiful, and should not be included in your inventory,  answer could be made only by showing that it had such and  such qualities, the very, by hypothesis, unknown qualities  that were to be sought.  Moreover, the field of beauty  contains so many and so heterogeneous objects , that the  retreat to their only common ground, aesthetic feeling,  appears inevitable.  A statue and a symphony can be reduced  to a common denominator most easily if the states of mind  which they induce are compared.  Thus the analysis of objects  passes naturally over to the analysis of mental states--the  point of view of psychology.    There is, however, a method subsidiary to the preceding, which  seeks the elements of Beauty in a study of the genesis and the  development of art forms.  But this leaves the essential  phenomenon absolutely untouched.  The general types of aesthetic  expression may indeed have been shaped by social forces,--  religious, commercial, domestic,--but as social products, not  as aesthetic phenomena.  Such studies reveal to us, as it were,  the excuse for the fact of music, poetry, painting--but they  tell us nothing of the reason why beautiful rather than ugly  forms were chosen, as who should show that the bird sings to  attract its mate, ignoring the relation and sequence of the  notes.  The decorative art of most savage tribes, for instance,  is nearly all of totemic origin, and the decayed and degraded  forms of snake, bird, bear, fish, may be traced in the most  apparently empty geometric patterns;--but what does this  discovery tell us of the essentially decorative quality of such  patterns or of the nature of beauty of form?  The study of the  Gothic cathedral reveals the source of its general plan and of  its whole scheme of ornament in detailed religious symbolism.  Yet a complete knowledge of the character of the religious  feeling which impelled to this monumental expression, and of  the genesis of every element of structure, fails to account  for the essential beauty of rhythm and proportion in the  finished work.  These researches, in short, explain the  reason for the existence, but not for the quality, of works  of art.    Thus it is in psychology that empirical aesthetics finds its  last resort.  And indeed, our plain man might say, the  aesthetic experience itself is inescapable and undeniable.  You know that the sight or the hearing of this thing gives  you a thrill of pleasure.  You may not be able to defend the  beauty of the object, but the fact of the experience you have.  The psychologist, seeking to analyze the vivid and unmistakable  Aesthetic experience, would therefore proceed somewhat as  follows.  He would select the salient characteristics of his  mental state in presence of a given work of art.  He would then  study, by experiment and introspection, how the particular  sense-stimulations of the work of art in question could become  the psychological conditions of these salient characteristics.  Thus, supposing the aesthetic experience to have been described  as \"the conscious happiness in which one is absorbed, and, as  it were, immersed in the sense-object,\"<1> the further special  aim, in connection with a picture, for instance, would be to  show how the sensations and associated ideas from color, line,  composition, and all the other elements of a picture may, on  general psychological principles, bring about this state of  happy absorption.  Such elements as can be shown to have a  direct relation to the aesthetic experience are then counted  as elements of the beauty of the aesthetic object, and such  as are invariable in all art forms would belong to the general  formula or concept of Beauty.    <1> M.W. Calkins: An Introduction to Psychology, 1902, p. 278.    This, it seems to me, is as favorable a way as possible of  stating the possibilities of an independent aesthetic psychology.    Yet this method, as it works out, does not exhaust the problem  the solution of which was affirmed to be the aim of every  aesthetics.  The aesthetic experience is very complex, and the  theoretical consequences of emphasizing this or that element  very great.  Thus, if it were held that the characteristics of  the aesthetic experience could be given by the complete analysis  of a single well-marked case,--say, our impressions before a  Doric column, or the Cathedral of Chartres, or the Giorgione  Venus,--it could be objected that for such a psychological  experience the essential elements are hard to isolate.  The  cathedral is stone rather than staff; it is three hundred  rather than fifty feet high.  Our reaction upon these facts  may or may not be essentials to the aesthetic moment, and we  can know whether they are essentials only by comparison and  exclusion.  It might be said, therefore, that the analysis of  a single, though typical, aesthetic experience is insufficient;  a wide induction is necessary.  Based on the experience of many  people, in face of the same object?  But to many there would  be no aesthetic experience.  On that of one person, over an  extensive field of objects?  How, then, determine the limits  of this field?  Half of the dispute of modern aesthetics is  over the right to include in the material for this induction  various kinds of enjoyment which are vivid, not directly  utilitarian, but traditionally excluded from the field.  Guyan,  for instance, in a charming passage of his \"Problemes de  l'Esthetique Contemporaine,\" argues for the aesthetic quality  of the moment when, exhausted by a long mountain tramp, he  quaffed, among the slopes of the Pyrenees, a bowl of foaming  milk.  The same dispute appears, in more complicated form, in  the conflicting dicta of the critics.    If we do not know what part of our feeling is aesthetic feeling,  how can wee go farther?  If the introspecting subject cannot  say, This is aesthetic feeling, it is logically impossible to  make his state of mind the basis for further advance.  It is  clear that the great question is of what one has a right to  include in the aesthetic experience.  But that one should have  such a \"right\" implies that there is an imperative element in  the situation, an absolute standard somewhere.    It seems to me that the secret of the difficulty lies in the  nature of the situation, with which an empirical treatment  must necessarily fail to deal. What we have called \"the  aesthetic experience\" is really a positive toning of the  general aesthetic attitude.  This positive toning corresponds  to aesthetic excellence in the object.  But wherever the  concept of excellence enters, there is always the implication  of a standard, value, judgment.  But where there is a standard  there is always an implicit a priori,--a philosophical foundation.    If, then, a philosophical method is the last resort and the  first condition of a true aesthetics, what is the secret of its  failure?  For that it has failed seems to be still the consensus  of opinion.  Simply, I believe and maintain, the unreasonable  and illogical demand which, for instance, Fechner makes in the  words I have quoted, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37512"],[0,"A Revision of Snakes of the Genus Conophis (Family Colubridae, from Middle (#5)"],[1,"    _Remarks._--Savage (1949:483-486) stated that his specimen of _C. l.  dunni_ (from Honduras) resembled _l. lineatus_ in having secondary  stripes on the 2nd and 8th rows and dark pigmentation throughout the  length of the 2nd row. As can be seen from the preceding discussion of  variation, a specimen having this color pattern is clearly within the  observed range of variation of _l. dunni_. The specimen in no way  represents an intergrade between _C. l. dunni_ and _l. lineatus_.    A specimen in the British Museum (Natural History), catalogued in 1853  (no. 53.2.4.16), has the locality listed as \"Mexico.\" Since this  specimen is of _C. l. dunni_ and this subspecies occurs only south of  Mexico, the locality must be considered erroneous; possibly the  locality as recorded referred only to the fact that the specimen came  from tropical Middle America.    The absence of paravertebral stripes, the presence of a lateral  dark stripe on the nape involving the 3rd and 4th rows of scales,  and the darkly pigmented 1st scale-row, in combination with the  characteristics of the genus, distinguish _C. l. dunni_ from all other  snakes in Mexico and Central America. The only sympatric species of  this genus, _C. pulcher_, differs in that it has paravertebral stripes  (though never a vertebral dark stripe). _Conophis pulcher_ has a  lateral dark stripe that includes the upper half of the second  scale-row on the anterior part of the body; stripes of _C. l. dunni_  never include more than the 3rd and 4th rows. Even as juveniles the  paravertebral row is not darkly pigmented in _C. l. dunni_ as it is in  _C. pulcher_.    _Distribution._--Semi-arid habitats from sea level to elevations of  1000 m. from the Cuilco Valley in western Guatemala, El Peten and  British Honduras southeastward to northeastern and southern Honduras,  western Nicaragua and northwestern Costa Rica (fig. 2).    _Specimens examined._--Total of 41 specimens, as follows: BRITISH  HONDURAS: _Cayo District_: Augustine, ERA-WTN BH-300; _Mountain Pine  Ridge, 10 mi.

Type  locality.--\"Mexico,\" restricted to Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico, by  Smith and Taylor (1950:351). Little is known about the type specimen,  and nothing, concerning its collector or the locality at which it was  collected. Smith (1941:122) assumed that the specimen illustrated by  Bocourt in Dumeril, Bocourt, and Mocquard (1886:pl. 38, fig. 5) was  the type of _C. l. lineatus_. I have also made this assumption  concerning the identity of the type specimen of this species,  especially because of the many inconsistencies appearing in the plate  accompanying the description by Dumeril, Bibron and Dumeril (1854:pl.  73), and by Jan and Sordelli (1866:pl. 6). Neither show the nape nor a  regular number of dorsal scales by which accurate determination of  color pattern can be made and by means of which _C. l. dunni_ and _C.  l. lineatus_ can be separated.    _Diagnosis._--Lateral dark stripe anteriorly passing through eye and  posteriorly involving fourth scale-row only; first scale-row darkly  pigmented; no paravertebral stripe; no dark pigment on vertebral row;  six or eight dark stripes at mid-body, secondary stripes often present  posteriorly; usually eight (sometimes seven) supralabials immaculate  or having dark ventral margins.    _Variation._--Twenty-six specimens have 157 to 169 (163.5 +- 3.59)  ventrals. Twenty of these snakes having complete tails have 60 to 73  (66.5 +- 4.26) subcaudals; the number of ventrals plus subcaudals  varies from 224 to 238 (230.1) in nineteen of these. In 26 specimens  the reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal scale-rows takes place between  ventrals 91 and 107 (100.2 +- 3.59). Sexual dimorphism is evident in  the number of subcaudals; nine females have 60 to 66 (62.4), and 11  males have 68 to 73 (69.8) subcaudals. The largest specimen (AMNH  19643) is a male from \"Mexico,\" having a body length of 626 mm., a  tail length of 168 mm. and a total length of 786 mm. No small  juveniles have been examined; the smallest specimen (AMNH 19618) is a  male from Veracruz, Mexico, having a body length of 325 mm., a tail  length of 90 mm. and a total length of 415 mm.    The greatest variation is in coloration. In preserved specimens the  ground-color is white, tannish-white, or often pale blue, with dark  stripes of black or deep brown present dorsolaterally and laterally.  Secondary stripes of paler brown are sometimes present, but the pale  browns have faded badly on many specimens. Normally four black stripes  are present at mid-body--a lateral pair on the 4th row of dorsal scales  and a dorsolateral pair on the 7th row (fig. 1, D). The lateral pair  is the posterior continuation of the stripe that on the head passes  through the eye; it continues on the nape as a narrow stripe on the  4th row only. In a few specimens the lateral stripe broadens to  include the upper third of the 3rd row posterior to the nape. In some  specimens both the dorsolateral and lateral dark stripes are present  on the nape as a row of elongated spots or dashes that become  continuous stripes of even width one-third to one-half of the distance  posteriorly along the body; in other specimens the stripes are  continuous on the nape. Posterior to the place of dorsal  scale-reduction from 19 to 17 rows by the fusion of the 3rd and 4th  rows, the lateral and dorsolateral stripes are moved downward by one  row. In some specimens secondary black or dark brown stripes are  present in the form of a series of dashes on the 5th and 8th rows;  posterior to the place of scale reduction, these dashes are on the 4th  and 7th rows. These dashes form a continuous stripe near the base of  the tail. On the tail the secondary and primary stripes on adjacent  rows sometimes fuse into a single broader stripe.    Usually the 1st row of dorsal scales is dark brown; in some specimens  the brown on the 1st or 7th row has faded in preservative. A few  specimens have small black spots on the moderate brown background of  the 1st row; in others the 1st row is only a somewhat darker brown  than the ground-color. The 2nd row sometimes is a medium brown, and  appears to be an additional stripe.    The ventrals usually have more or less conspicuous dark spots  laterally; in some specimens there are no spots. Except for the  lateral spots (when present) the ventrals are immaculate white. The  dorsal ground-color is pale brownish-white, white or pale blue between  the 4th and 7th rows of dorsal scales and dorsally between the 7th  rows on each side. Stripes are never present on the uniformly pale  colored 8th, 9th and vertebral scale-rows.    Usually there are eight supralabials on each side; however, seven of  the 27 specimens"]]]
