To say that we actually believed in  vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement. Rather  must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of  certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and  attenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional space  because of its more intimate connection with other spatial units, yet  close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional  manifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may never  hope to understand.    In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array  of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house;  traceable to one or another of the ill-favored French settlers of two  centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of  atomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed an  abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity--dark spheres which for  normal folk hold only repulsion and terror--their recorded history  seemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygone  seventeen-thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid  brain of one or more of them--notably the sinister Paul Roulet--which  obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, and  continued to function in some multiple-dimensioned space along the  original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the  encroaching community?    Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in  the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity  and intra-atomic action. One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of  substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible  or immaterial subtractions from the life-force or bodily tissue and  fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates  and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself. It might be  actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of  self-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be in  our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms  a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world's life, health,  and sanity.    What baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might  encounter the thing. No sane person had ever seen it, and few had ever  felt it definitely. It might be pure energy--a form ethereal and outside  the realm of substance--or it might be partly material; some unknown and  equivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulous  approximations of the solid, liquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticled  states. The anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor, the form of the  yellowish vapor, and the curvature of the tree-roots in some of the old  tales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with the  human shape; but how representative or permanent that similarity might  be, none could say with any kind of certainty.           *       *       *       *       *    We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted  Crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with  peculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and  opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of  military flame-throwers of the sort used in the World War, in case it  proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction--for  like the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were prepared to burn the  thing's heart out if heart existed to burn. All this aggressive  mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged with  reference to the cot and chairs, and to the spot before the fireplace  where the mold had taken strange shapes. That suggestive patch, by the  way, was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture and  instruments, and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil. For  a moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitely  limned form--but then I thought of the legends.    Our cellar vigil began at ten p. m., daylight saving time, and as it  continued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak,  filtered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeble  phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, showed the dripping  stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the  dank, fetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi;  the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and  other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of  the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and  chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase  with ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of  blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence  of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven--these  things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate  destructive machinery we had brought.    We had, as in my own former explorations, left the door to the street  unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open  in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our idea  that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malign  entity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of the  thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we had  recognized and observed it sufficiently. How long it might require to  evoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion. It occurred to us,  too, that our venture was far from safe; for in what strength the thing  might appear no one could tell. But we deemed the game worth the hazard,  and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the seeking  of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our  entire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked--far into the  night, till my uncle's growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down  for his two-hour sleep.    Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours  alone--I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;  perhaps more alone than he can realize. My uncle breathed heavily, his  deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and  punctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping water  within--for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in  this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry  of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in from  the street through the screened window; and once, when the noisome  atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and  looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and  my nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward my  watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of  apprehension.    Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had  turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the  first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity,  occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities  of a choking moan.    I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so  rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the  light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most  surprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been  merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature  of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in  itself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle's facial  expression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our  situation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at  all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and  well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling  within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this _variety_ which  chiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing  perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but  many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.           *       *       *       *       *    All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his  mouth and teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable,  and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them  which filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's  education and the interminable translations he had made from  anthropological and antiquarian articles in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.  For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering _in French_, and the few  phrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he  had ever adapted from the famous Paris magazine.    Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and he  leaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry in  English, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, \"My breath, my breath!\"  Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facial  expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to  relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a  kind of awe.    He had, he said, floated off from a very ordinary series of  dream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he  had ever read.

Here was the opportunity of the bankrupt adventurer and the  stranded promoter. The treasures could be found by the science of magic.  The notion was closely akin to the still current idea that wells can be  located by the use of hazel wands. But none of the conjurers--and this  seems a curious fact to one familiar with the English stories of the  supernatural--ever lit upon the desired treasure. Their efforts hardly  aroused public interest, least of all alarm. Experimenters, who fifty  years later would have been hurried before the privy council, were  allowed to conjure and dig as they pleased. Henry VIII even sold the  right in one locality, and sold it at a price which showed how lightly  he regarded it.[28]    Other forms of magic were of course practiced. By the time that  Elizabeth succeeded to the throne, it is safe to say that the practice  of forbidden arts had become wide-spread in England. Reginald Scot a  little later declared that every parish was full of men and women who  claimed to work miracles.[29] Most of them were women, and their  performances read like those of the gipsy fortune-tellers today.  \"Cunning women\" they called themselves. They were many of them  semi-medical or pseudo-medical practitioners[30] who used herbs and  extracts, and, when those failed, charms and enchantments, to heal the  sick. If they were fairly fortunate, they became known as \"good  witches.\" Particularly in connection with midwifery were their  incantations deemed effective.[31] From such functions it was no far  call to forecast the outcome of love affairs, or to prepare potions  which would ensure love.[32] They became general helpers to the  distressed. They could tell where lost property was to be found, an  undertaking closely related to that of the treasure seekers.[33]    It was usually in the less serious diseases[34] that these cunning folk  were consulted. They were called upon often indeed--if one fragmentary  evidence may be trusted--to diagnose the diseases and to account for the  deaths of domestic animals.[35] It may very easily be that it was from  the necessity of explaining the deaths of animals that the practitioners  of magic began to talk about witchcraft and to throw out a hint that  some witch was at the back of the matter. It would be in line with  their own pretensions. Were they not good witches? Was it not their  province to overcome the machinations of the black witches, that is,  witches who wrought evil rather than good? The disease of an animal was  hard to prescribe for. A sick horse would hardly respond to the waving  of hands and a jumble of strange words. The animal was, in all  probability, bewitched.    At any rate, whether in this particular manner or not, it became shortly  the duty of the cunning women to recognize the signs of witchcraft, to  prescribe for it, and if possible to detect the witch. In many cases the  practitioner wisely enough refused to name any one, but described the  appearance of the guilty party and set forth a series of operations by  which to expose her machinations. If certain herbs were plucked and  treated in certain ways, if such and such words were said, the guilty  party would appear at the door. At other times the wise woman gave a  perfectly recognizable description of the guilty one and offered  remedies that would nullify her maleficent influences. No doubt the  party indicated as the witch was very often another of the \"good  witches,\" perhaps a rival. Throughout the records of the superstition  are scattered examples of wise women upon whom suspicion suddenly  lighted, and who were arraigned and sent to the gallows. Beyond question  the suspicion began often with the ill words of a neighbor,[36] perhaps  of a competitor, words that started an attack upon the woman's  reputation that she was unable to repel.    It is not to be supposed that the art of cunning was confined to the  female sex. Throughout the reign of Elizabeth, the realm was alive with  men who were pretenders to knowledge of mysteries. So closely was the  occupation allied to that of the physician that no such strict line as  now exists between reputable physicians and quack doctors separated the  \"good witches\" from the regular practicers of medicine. It was so  customary in Elizabethan times for thoroughly reputable and even eminent  medical men to explain baffling cases as the results of witchcraft[37]  that to draw the line of demarcation between them and the pretenders who  suggested by means of a charm or a glass a maleficent agent would be  impossible. Granted the phenomena of conjuration and witchcraft as  facts--and no one had yet disputed them--it was altogether easy to  believe that good witches who antagonized the works of black witches  were more dependable than the family physician, who could but suggest  the cause of sickness. The regular practitioner must often have created  business for his brother of the cunning arts.    One would like to know what these practicers thought of their own arts.  Certainly some of them accomplished cures. Mental troubles that baffled  the ordinary physician would offer the \"good witch\" a rare field for  successful endeavor. Such would be able not only to persuade a community  of their good offices, but to deceive themselves. Not all of them,  however, by any means, were self-deceived. Conscious fraud played a part  in a large percentage of cases. One witch was very naive in her  confession of fraud. When suspected of sorcery and cited to court, she  was said to have frankly recited her charm:        \"My lofe in my lappe,        My penny in my purse,      You are never the better,        I am never the worse.\"    She was acquitted and doubtless continued to add penny to penny.[38]    We need not, indeed, be surprised that the state should have been remiss  in punishing a crime so vague in character and so closely related to an  honorable profession. Except where conjuration had affected high  interests of state, it had been practically overlooked by the  government. Now and then throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth  centuries there had been isolated plots against the sovereign, in which  conjury had played a conspicuous part. With these few exceptions the  crime had been one left to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. But now the  state was ready to reclaim its jurisdiction over these crimes and to  assume a very positive attitude of hostility towards them. This came  about in a way that has already been briefly indicated. The government  of the queen found itself threatened constantly by plots for making away  with the queen, plots which their instigators hoped would overturn the  Protestant regime and bring England back into the fold. Elizabeth had  hardly mounted her throne when her councillors began to suspect the use  of sorcery and conjuration against her life. As a result they  instituted the most painstaking inquiries into all reported cases of the  sort, especially in and about London and the neighboring counties. Every  Catholic was suspected. Two cases that were taken up within the first  year came to nothing, but a third trial proved more serious. In November  of 1558 Sir Anthony Fortescue,[39] member of a well known Catholic  family, was arrested, together with several accomplices, upon the charge  of casting the horoscope of the queen's life. Fortescue was soon  released, but in 1561 he was again put in custody, this time with two  brothers-in-law, Edmund and Arthur Pole, nephews of the famous cardinal  of that name. The plot that came to light had many ramifications. It was  proposed to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, to Edmund Pole, and from  Flanders to proclaim her Queen of England. In the meantime Elizabeth was  to die a natural death--at least so the conspirators claimed--prophesied  for her by two conjurers, John Prestall and Edmund Cosyn, with the  assistance of a \"wicked spryte.\" It was discovered that the plot  involved the French and Spanish ambassadors. Relations between Paris and  London became strained. The conspirators were tried and sentenced to  death. Fortescue himself, perhaps because he was a second cousin of the  queen and brother of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, seems to have  escaped the gallows.[40]    The Fortescue affair was, however, but one of many conspiracies on foot  during the time. Throughout the sixties and the seventies the queen's  councillors were on the lookout. Justices of the peace and other  prominent men in the counties were kept informed by the privy council of  reported conjurers, and they were instructed to send in what evidence  they could gather against them. It is remarkable that three-fourths of  the cases that came under investigation were from a territory within  thirty miles of London. Two-thirds of them were from Essex. Not all the  conjurers were charged with plotting against the queen, but that charge  was most common. It is safe to suppose that, in the cases where that  accusation was not preferred, it was nevertheless the alarm of the privy  council for the life of the queen that had prompted the investigation  and arrest.    Between 1578 and 1582, critical years in the affairs of the Scottish  queen, the anxiety of the London authorities was intense[41]--their  precautions were redoubled. Representatives of the government were sent  out to search for conjurers and were paid well for their services.[42]  The Earl of Shrewsbury, a member of the council who had charge of the  now captive Queen Mary, kept in his employ special detectors of  conjuring.[43] Nothing about Elizabeth's government was better  organized than Cecil's detective service, and the state papers show that  the ferreting out of the conjurers was by no means the least of its  work. It was a service carried on, of course, as quietly as could be,  and yet the cases now and again came to light and made clear to the  public that the government was very fearful of"]]]
