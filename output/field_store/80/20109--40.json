[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#5)"],[1," undergoing a very minute and rigid examination. The  records of the court tell us that Cervantes asserted that he was  residing at Valladolid for purposes of business; that, by reason of  his literary pursuits and reputation, he was frequently honoured by  visits from gentlemen of the royal household and learned men of the  university; and, moreover, that he was living in great poverty; for we  are told that he, his wife, and his two sisters, one of whom was a  nun, and his niece, were living in a scanty and mean lodging on the  fourth floor of a poor-looking house, and amongst them all had only  one maid-servant. He stated his age to be upwards of fifty, though we  know that, if born in 1547, he must in fact have nearly, or quite  completed his fifty-seventh year at this time. In such obscurity,  then, was the immortal author of Don Quixote living at the time of its  publication.    The First Part of this famous romance was dedicated to Don Alonzo  Lopez de Zuniga, Duke of Bexar or Bejar, who at this time affected the  character of a Mecaenas; whose conduct, however, towards Cervantes was  not marked by a generosity suited to his rank, nor according to his  profession, nor at all corresponding to the merits and wants of the  author. But the book needed no patron; it must make its own way, and  it did so. It was read immediately in court and city, by old and  young, learned and unlearned, and by all with equal delight; \"it went  forth with the universal applause of all nations.\" Four editions (and  in the seventeenth century, when so few persons comparatively could  read, that was equivalent to more than double the number at the  present time)--four editions were published and sold in one year.    The profits from the sale of Don Quixote must have been very  considerable; and they, together with the remains of his paternal  estates, and the pensions from the count and the cardinal, enabled  Cervantes to live in ease and comfort. Ten years elapsed before he  sent any new work to the press; which time was passed in study, and in  attending to his pecuniary affairs. Though Madrid was now his fixed  abode, we often find him at Esquivias, where he probably went to enjoy  the quiet and repose of the village, and to look after the property  which he there possessed as his wife's dowry.    In 1613 he published his twelve _Novelas Exemplares_, or 'Exemplary  Novels,' with a dedication to his patron the Count de Lemos. He called  them \"exemplary,\" because, as he tells us, his other novels had been  censured as more satirical than exemplary; which fault he determined  to amend in these; and therefore each of them contains interwoven in  it some error to be avoided, or some virtue to be practised. He  asserts that they were entirely his own invention, not borrowed or  copied from any other works of the same sort, nor translated from any  other language, as was the case with most of the novels which his  countrymen had published hitherto. But, notwithstanding this, we  cannot fail to remark a strong resemblance in them to the tales of  Boccaccio; still they are most excellent in their way, and have always  been favourites with the Spanish youth for their interest and pure  morality, and their ease and manliness of style. The titles of these  novels are, _The Little Gipsey_, _The Generous Lover_, _Rinconete and  Cortadillo_, _The Spanish-English Lady_, _The Glass Doctor_, _The  Force of Blood_, _The Jealous Estremaduran_, _The Illustrious  Servant-Maid_, _The Two Damsels_, _The Lady Cornelia Bentivoglio_,  _The Deceitful Marriage_, and _The Dialogue of the Dogs_. They have  all been translated into English, and are probably not unknown to some  of our readers.    The next year Cervantes published another small work, entitled the  _Viage de Parnasso_, or 'A Journey to Parnassus,' which is a playful  satire upon the Spanish poets, after the manner of Caesar Caporali's  upon the Italian poets under a similar title. It is a good picture of  the Spanish literature of his day, and one of the most powerful of his  poetical works. It is full of satire, though not ill-natured, and  there was no man of genius of the time who would complain of being too  harshly treated in it. Cervantes introduces himself as the oldest and  poorest of all the poetical fraternity, \"the naked Adam of Spanish  poets.\" The plot of the poem is as follows:--Apollo wishes to rid  Parnassus of the bad poets, and to that end he calls together all the  others by a message through Mercury. When all assembled, he leads them  into a rich garden of Parnassus, and assigns to each the place which  corresponds to his merits. Poor Cervantes alone does not obtain this  distinction, and remains without being noticed in the presence of the  rest, before whom all the works he has ever published are displayed.  In vain does he urge his love for literature, and the troubles which  he had endured for its sake; no seat can he get. At last Apollo, in  compassion upon him, advises him to fold up his cloak, and to make  that his seat; but, alas, so poor is he that he does not possess such  a thing, and so he is obliged to remain standing in spite of his age,  his talents, and the opinion of many who know and confess the honour  and position which is his due. The vessel in which this 'Journey to  Parnassus' is performed is described in a way quite worthy of  Cervantes: \"From topmast to keel it was all of verse; not one foot of  prose was there in it. The airy railings which fenced the deck were  all of double-rhymes. Ballads, an impudent but necessary race,  occupied the rowing-benches; and rightly, for there is nothing to  which they may not be turned. The poop was grand and gay, but somewhat  strange in its style, being stuck all over with sonnets of the richest  workmanship. The stroke-oars on either side were pulled by two  vigorous triplets, which regulated the motion of the vessel in a way  both easy and powerful. The gangway was one long and most melancholy  elegy, from which tears were continually dropping.\"    The publication of a shameful imitation, pretending to be a Second  Part of the Adventures of Don Quixote accelerated the production of  Cervantes' own Second Part; which accordingly made its appearance at  the beginning of 1615. Contrary to common experience, this Second Part  was received, and deservedly, with as great applause as was the First  Part ten years before.    Cervantes had now but a few more months to live; and it must, in his  declining years, have been a great consolation to find that the  efforts of his genius were still appreciated by his countrymen; not to  mention the relief from pecuniary embarrassments which the profits of  the sale must have afforded him. Cervantes was now at the height to  which his ambition had all along aimed; he had no rival; for Lope de  Vega was dead, and the literary kingdom of Spain was all his own. He  was courted by the great; no strangers came to Madrid without making  the writer of Don Quixote the first object of their inquiry; he  reposed in honour, free from all calumny, in the bosom of his family.    This same year he published eight comedies, and the same number of  interludes; two only in verse, the rest in prose. It does not seem  likely that these were written at this time; they must have been the  works of his earlier years; but, like his novels, corrected and given  to the public when his judgment was more mature. Several of them had,  no doubt, been performed on the stage many years before, and remained  with Cervantes in manuscript. The dissertation which he prefixed to  them is full of interest, and is very curious and valuable, since it  contains the only account we have of the early history of the Spanish  drama.    In 1616, he completed and prepared for the press a romance entitled  _Persiles and Sigismunda_, of a grave character, written in imitation  of the _Ethiopics_ of Heliodorus; it was the work of many years, and  is accounted by the Spaniards one of the purest specimens of Castilian  writing. He finished it just before his death, but never lived to see  it published. The dedication and prologue of Persiles and Sigismunda  are very affecting; they are the voice of a dying man speaking to us  of his approaching dissolution.    From the nature of his complaint, Cervantes retained his mental  faculties to the very last, and so was able to be the historian of his  latter days. At the end of the preface to _Persiles_, he tells us that  he had gone for a few days to Esquivias, in hopes that country air  might be beneficial to him. On his return to Madrid, he was  accompanied by his friends, when a young student on horseback overtook  them, riding very hard to do so, and complaining in consequence of the  rapid pace at which they were going. One of the three made answer that  it was no fault of theirs, but that the horse of Miguel de Cervantes  was to be blamed, whose trot was none of the slowest. Scarcely had the  name been pronounced, when the young man dismounted; and touching the  border of Cervantes' left sleeve, exclaimed, \"Yes, yes, it is indeed  the maimed perfection, the all-famous, the delightful writer, the joy  and darling of the Muses.\" This salutation was returned with  Cervantes' natural modesty; and the worthy student performed the rest  of the journey with him and his friends. \"We drew up a little,\" says  Cervantes, \"and rode on at a measured pace; and whilst we rode, we  happened to talk of my illness. The good student soon knocked away  all my hopes, and let me know my doom, by telling me that it was a  dropsy that I had got: the thirst attending which, not all the waters  of the ocean, though it were not salt, could suffice to quench.  'Therefore, Senor Cervantes,' said he, 'you must drink nothing at all,  but forget not to eat, and to eat plentifully; that alone will recover  you without any physic.' 'Others have told me the same,' answered I;  'but I can no more forbear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#5)"],[1,"of April. At the complementary elections,  which were held in the early days of June, he was elected in Paris by  seventy-seven thousand votes.    After the fatal days of June, he published an article on le terme, which  caused the first suspension of \"Le Representant du Peuple.\" It was at  that time that he introduced a bill into the Assembly, which, being  referred to the Committee on the Finances, drew forth, first, the report  of M. Thiers, and then the speech which Proudhon delivered, on the  31st of July, in reply to this report. \"Le Representant du Peuple,\"  reappearing a few days later, he wrote, a propos of the law requiring  journals to give bonds, his famous article on \"The Malthusians\" (August  10, 1848).    Ten days afterwards, \"Le Representant du Peuple,\" again suspended,  definitively ceased to appear. \"Le Peuple,\" of which he was the  editor-in-chief, and the first number of which was issued in the early  part of September, appeared weekly at first, for want of sufficient  bonds; it afterwards appeared daily, with a double number once a week.  Before \"Le Peuple\" had obtained its first bond, Proudhon published a  remarkable pamphlet on the \"Right to Labor,\"--a right which he denied  in the form in which it was then affirmed. It was during the same  period that he proposed, at the Poissonniere banquet, his Toast to the  Revolution.    Proudhon, who had been asked to preside at the banquet, refused, and  proposed in his stead, first, Ledru-Rollin, and then, in view of the  reluctance of the organizers of the banquet, the illustrious president  of the party of the Mountain, Lamennais. It was evidently his intention  to induce the representatives of the Extreme Left to proclaim at last  with him the Democratic and Social Republic. Lamennais being accepted by  the organizers, the Mountain promised to be present at the banquet. The  night before, all seemed right, when General Cavaignac replaced Minister  Senart by Minister Dufaure-Vivien. The Mountain, questioning the  government, proposed a vote of confidence in the old minister, and,  tacitly, of want of confidence in the new. Proudhon abstained from  voting on this proposition. The Mountain declared that it would not  attend the banquet, if Proudhon was to be present. Five Montagnards,  Mathieu of Drome at their head, went to the temporary office of \"Le  Peuple\" to notify him of this. \"Citizen Proudhon,\" said they to the  organizers in his presence, \"in abstaining from voting to-day on  the proposition of the Mountain, has betrayed the Republican cause.\"  Proudhon, vehemently questioned, began his defence by recalling, on  the one hand, the treatment which he had received from the dismissed  minister; and, on the other, the impartial conduct displayed towards him  in 1840 by M. Vivien, the new minister. He then attacked the Mountain by  telling its delegates that it sought only a pretext, and that really, in  spite of its professions of Socialism in private conversation, whether  with him or with the organizers of the banquet, it had not the courage  to publicly declare itself Socialist.    On the following day, in his Toast to the Revolution, a toast which  was filled with allusions to the exciting scene of the night before,  Proudhon commenced his struggle against the Mountain. His duel with  Felix Pyat was one of the episodes of this struggle, which became less  bitter on Proudhon's side after the Mountain finally decided to publicly  proclaim the Democratic and Social Republic. The campaign for the  election of a President of the Republic had just begun. Proudhon made  a very sharp attack on the candidacy of Louis Bonaparte in a pamphlet  which is regarded as one of his literary chefs-d'oeuvre: the \"Pamphlet  on the Presidency.\" An opponent of this institution, against which he  had voted in the Constituent Assembly, he at first decided to take no  part in the campaign. But soon seeing that he was thus increasing the  chances of Louis Bonaparte, and that if, as was not at all probable, the  latter should not obtain an absolute majority of the votes, the Assembly  would not fail to elect General Cavaignac, he espoused, for the sake of  form, the candidacy of Raspail, who was supported by his friends in  the Socialist Committee. Charles Delescluze, the editor-in-chief of  \"La Revolution Democratique et Sociale,\" who could not forgive him for  having preferred Raspail to Ledru-Rollin, the candidate of the Mountain,  attacked him on the day after the election with a violence which  overstepped all bounds. At first, Proudhon had the wisdom to refrain  from answering him. At length, driven to an extremity, he became  aggressive himself, and Delescluze sent him his seconds. This time,  Proudhon positively refused to fight; he would not have fought with  Felix Pyat, had not his courage been called in question.    On the 25th of January, 1849, Proudhon, rising from a sick bed, saw  that the existence of the Constituent Assembly was endangered by the  coalition of the monarchical parties with Louis Bonaparte, who was  already planning his coup d'Etat. He did not hesitate to openly attack  the man who had just received five millions of votes. He wanted to break  the idol; he succeeded only in getting prosecuted and condemned himself.  The prosecution demanded against him was authorized by a majority of the  Constituent Assembly, in spite of the speech which he delivered on that  occasion. Declared guilty by the jury, he was sentenced, in March, 1849,  to three years' imprisonment and the payment of a fine of ten thousand  francs.    Proudhon had not abandoned for a single moment his project of a Bank of  Exchange, which was to operate without capital with a sufficient number  of merchants and manufacturers for adherents. This bank, which he then  called the Bank of the People, and around which he wished to gather the  numerous working-people's associations which had been formed since  the 24th of February, 1848, had already obtained a certain number of  subscribers and adherents, the latter to the number of thirty-seven  thousand. It was about to commence operations, when Proudhon's sentence  forced him to choose between imprisonment and exile. He did not hesitate  to abandon his project and return the money to the subscribers. He  explained the motives which led him to this decision in an article in  \"Le Peuple.\"    Having fled to Belgium, he remained there but a few days, going thence  to Paris, under an assumed name, to conceal himself in a house in the  Rue de Chabrol. From his hiding-place he sent articles almost every  day, signed and unsigned, to \"Le Peuple.\" In the evening, dressed in a  blouse, he went to some secluded spot to take the air. Soon, emboldened  by habit, he risked an evening promenade upon the Boulevards, and  afterwards carried his imprudence so far as to take a stroll by daylight  in the neighborhood of the Gare du Nord. It was not long before he was  recognized by the police, who arrested him on the 6th of June, 1849, in  the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere.    Taken to the office of the prefect of police, then to Sainte-Pelagie,  he was in the Conciergerie on the day of the 13th of June, 1849, which  ended with the violent suppression of \"Le Peuple.\" He then began to  write the \"Confessions of a Revolutionist,\" published towards the end  of the year. He had been again transferred to Sainte-Pelagie, when he  married, in December, 1849, Mlle. Euphrasie Piegard, a young working  girl whose hand he had requested in 1847. Madame Proudhon bore him four  daughters, of whom but two, Catherine and Stephanie, survived their  father. Stephanie died in 1873.    In October, 1849, \"Le Peuple\" was replaced by a new journal, \"La Voix  du Peuple,\" which Proudhon edited from his prison cell. In it were  published his discussions with Pierre Leroux and Bastiat.    The political articles which he sent to \"La Voix du Peuple\" so  displeased the government finally, that it transferred him to Doullens,  where he was secretly confined for some time. Afterwards taken back  to Paris, to appear before the assizes of the Seine in reference to  an article in \"La Voix du Peuple,\" he was defended by M. Cremieux and  acquitted. From the Conciergerie he went again to Sainte-Pelagie, where  he ended his three years in prison on the 6th of June, 1852.    \"La Voix du Peuple,\" suppressed before the promulgation of the law of  the 31st of May, had been replaced by a weekly sheet, \"Le Peuple\" of  1850. Established by the aid of the principal members of the Mountain,  this journal soon met with the fate of its predecessors.    In 1851, several months before the coup d'Etat, Proudhon published the  \"General Idea of the Revolution of the Nineteenth Century,\" in which,  after having shown the logical series of unitary governments,--from  monarchy, which is the first term, to the direct government of the  people, which is the last,--he opposes the ideal of an-archy or  self-government to the communistic or governmental ideal.    At this period, the Socialist party, discouraged by the elections of  1849, which resulted in a greater conservative triumph than those of  1848, and justly angry with the national representative body which  had just passed the law of the 31st of May, 1850, demanded direct  legislation and direct government. Proudhon, who did not want, at any  price, the plebiscitary system which he had good reason to regard as  destructive of liberty, did not hesitate to point out, to those of his  friends who expected every thing from direct legislation, one of the  antinomies of universal suffrage. In so far as it is an institution  intended to achieve, for the benefit of the greatest number, the social  reforms to which landed suffrage is opposed, universal suffrage is  powerless; especially if it pretends to legislate or govern directly.  For, until the social reforms are accomplished, the greatest number is  of necessity the least enlightened, and"]]]
