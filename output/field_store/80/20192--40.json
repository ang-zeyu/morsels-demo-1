In these works faith is still slight and weak; let us ask further,  whether they believe that they are well-pleasing to God when they  suffer in body, property, honor, friends, or whatever they have, and  believe that God of His mercy appoints their sufferings and  difficulties for them, whether they be small or great. This is real  strength, to trust in God when to all our senses and reason He appears  to be angry; and to have greater confidence in Him than we feel. Here  He is hidden, as the bride says in the Song of Songs: \"Behold he  standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows\"; that is, He  stands hidden among the sufferings, which would separate us from Him  like a wall, yea, like a wall of stone, and yet He looks upon me and  does not leave me, for He is standing and is ready graciously to help,  and through the window of dim faith He permits Himself to be seen.  And  Jeremiah says in Lamentations, \"He casts off men, but He does it not  willingly.\"    This faith they do not know at all, and give up, thinking that God has  forsaken them and is become their enemy; they even lay the blame of  their ills on men and devils, and have no confidence at all in God. For  this reason, too, their suffering is always an offence and harmful to  them, and yet they go and do some good works, as they think, and are  not aware of their unbelief. But they who in such suffering trust God  and retain a good, firm confidence in Him, and believe that He is  pleased with them, these see in their sufferings and afflictions  nothing but precious merits and the rarest possessions, the value of  which no one can estimate. For faith and confidence make precious  before God all that which others think most shameful, so that it is  written even of death in Psalm cxvi, \"Precious in the sight of the Lord  is the death of His saints.\" And just as the confidence and faith are  better, higher and stronger at this stage than in the first stage, so  and to the same degree do the sufferings which are borne in this faith  excel all works of faith. Therefore between such works and sufferings  there is an immeasurable difference and the sufferings are infinitely  better.    VIII. Beyond all this is the highest stage of faith, when; God punishes  the conscience not only with temporal sufferings, but with death, hell,  and sin, and refuses grace and mercy, as though it were His will to  condemn and to be angry eternally. This few men experience, but David  cries out in Psalm vi, \"O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger.\" To  believe at such times that God, in His mercy, is pleased with us, is  the highest work that can be done by and in the creature; but of this  the work-righteous and doers of good works know nothing at all. For how  could they here look for good things and grace from God, as long as  they are not certain in their works, and doubt even on the lowest step  of faith.    In this way I have, as I said, always praised faith, and rejected all  works which are done without such faith, in order thereby to lead men  from the false, pretentious, pharisaic, unbelieving good works, with  which all monastic houses, churches, homes, low and higher classes are  overfilled, and lead them to the true, genuine, thoroughly good,  believing works. In this no one opposes me except the unclean beasts,  which do not divide the hoof, as the Law of Moses decrees; who will  suffer no distinction among good works, but go lumbering along: if only  they pray, fast, establish endowments, go to confession, and do enough,  everything shall be good, although in all this they have had no faith  in God's grace and approval. Indeed, they consider the works best of  all, when they have done many, great and long works without any such  confidence, and they look for good only after the works are done; and  so they build their confidence not on divine favor, but on the works  they have done, that is, on sand and water, from which they must at  last take a cruel fall, as Christ says, Matthew vii. This good-will and  favor, on which our confidence rests, was proclaimed by the angels from  heaven, when they sang on Christmas night: \"Gloria in excelsis Deo,  Glory to God in the highest, peace to earth, gracious favor to man.\"    IX. Now this is the work of the First Commandment, which commands:  \"Thou shalt have no other gods,\" which means: \"Since I alone am God,  thou shalt place all thy confidence, trust and faith on Me alone, and  on no one else.\" For that is not to have a god, if you call him God  only with your lips, or worship him with the knees or bodily gestures;  but if you trust Him with the heart, and look to Him for all good,  grace and favor, whether in works or sufferings, in life or death, in  joy or sorrow; as the Lord Christ says to the heathen woman, John iv:  \"I say unto thee, they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and  in truth.\" And this faith, faithfulness, confidence deep in the heart,  is the true fulfilling of the First Commandment; without this there is  no other work that is able to satisfy this Commandment. And as this  Commandment is the very first, highest and best, from which all the  others proceed, in which they exist, and by which they are directed and  measured, so also its work, that is, the faith or confidence in God's  favor at all times, is the very first, highest and best, from which all  others must proceed, exist, remain, be directed and measured. Compared  with this, other works are just as if the other Commandments were  without the First, and there were no God, Therefore St. Augustine well  says that the works of the First Commandment are faith, hope and love.  As I said above, such faith and confidence bring love and hope with  them. Nay, if we see it aright, love is the first, or comes at the same  instant with faith. For I could not trust God, if I did not think that  He wished to be favorable and to love me, which leads me, in turn, to  love Him and to trust Him heartily and to look to Him for all good  things.    X. Now you see for yourself that all those who do not at at all times  trust God and do not in all their works or sufferings, life and death,  trust in His favor, grace and good-will, but seek His favor in other  things or in themselves, do not keep this Commandment, and practise  real idolatry, even if they were to do the works of all the other  Commandments, and in addition had all the prayers, fasting, obedience,  patience, chastity, and innocence of all the saints combined. For the  chief work is not present, without which all the others are nothing but  mere sham, show and pretence, with nothing back of them; against which  Christ warns us, Matthew vii: \"Beware of false prophets, which come to  you in sheep's clothing.\" Such are all who wish with their many good  works, as they say, to make God favorable to themselves, and to buy  God's grace from Him, as if He were a huckster or a day-laborer,  unwilling to give His grace and favor for nothing. These are the most  perverse people on earth, who will hardly or never be converted to the  right way. Such too are all who in adversity run hither and thither,  and look for counsel and help everywhere except from God, from Whom  they are most urgently commanded to seek it; whom the Prophet Isaiah  reproves thus, Isaiah ix: \"The mad people turneth not to Him that  smiteth them\"; that is, God smote them and sent them sufferings and all  kinds of adversity, that they should run to Him and trust Him.  But  they run away from Him to men, now to Egypt, now to Assyria, perchance  also to the devil; and of such idolatry much is written in the same  Prophet and in the Books of the Kings. This is also the way of all holy  hypocrites when they are in trouble: they do not run to God, but flee  from Him, and only think of how they may get rid of their trouble  through their own efforts or through human help, and yet they consider  themselves and let others consider them pious people.    XI. This is what St. Paul means in many places, where he ascribes so  much to faith, that he says: Justus ex fide sua vivit, \"the righteous  man draws his life out of his faith,\" and faith is that because of  which he is counted righteous before God. If righteousness consists of  faith, it is clear that faith fulfils all commandments and makes all  works righteous, since no one is justified except he keep all the  commands of God. Again, the works can justify no one before God without  faith. So utterly and roundly does the Apostle reject works and praise  faith, that some have taken offence at his words and say: \"Well, then,  we will do no more good works,\" although he condemns such men as erring  and foolish.    So men still do. When we reject the great, pretentious works of our  time, which are done entirely without faith, they say: Men are only to  believe and not to do anything good. For nowadays they say that the  works of the First Commandment are singing, reading, organ-playing,  reading the mass, saying matins and vespers and the other hours, the  founding and decorating of churches, altars, and monastic houses, the  gathering of bells, jewels, garments, trinkets and treasures, running  to Rome and to the saints. Further, when we are dressed up and bow,  kneel, pray the rosary and the Psalter, and all this not before an  idol, but before the holy cross of God or the pictures of His saints:  this we call honoring and worshiping God, and, according to the First  Commandment, \"having no other gods\"; although these things usurers,  adulterers and all manner of sinners can do too, and do them daily.    Of course, if these things are done with such faith that we believe  that they please God, then they are praiseworthy, not because of their  virtue, but because of such faith, for which all works are of equal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#5)"],[1,"three who stood before it.    \"How dare you disturb me?\" it asked in a peevish voice.  \"You ought to  be ashamed of yourselves.\"    \"Never mind that,\" returned the Sailor.  \"Do you remember tellin' me  yesterday 'bout a Magic Flower in a Gold Pot?\"    \"Do you think I'm a fool?  Look at my brains--you can see 'em work.  Of  course I remember!\" said the cat.    \"Well, where can we find it?\"    \"You can't.  It's none of your business, anyhow.  Go away and let me  sleep,\" advised the Glass Cat.    \"Now, see here,\" said Dorothy; \"we want the Magic Flower to give to  Ozma on her birthday.  You'd be glad to please Ozma, wouldn't you?\"    \"I'm not sure,\" replied the creature.  \"Why should I want to please  anybody?\"    \"You've got a heart, 'cause I can see it inside of you,\" said Trot.    \"Yes; it's a pretty heart, and I'm fond of it,\" said the cat, twisting  around to view its own body.  \"But it's made from a ruby, and it's hard  as nails.\"    \"Aren't you good for ANYthing?\" asked Trot.    \"Yes, I'm pretty to look at, and that's more than can be said of you,\"  retorted the creature.    Trot laughed at this, and Dorothy, who understood the Glass Cat pretty  well, said soothingly:    \"You are indeed beautiful, and if you can tell Cap'n Bill where to find  the Magic Flower, all the people in Oz will praise your cleverness.  The Flower will belong to Ozma, but everyone will know the Glass Cat  discovered it.\"    This was the kind of praise the crystal creature liked.    \"Well,\" it said, while the pink brains rolled around, \"I found the  Magic Flower way up in the north of the Munchkin Country where few  people live or ever go.  There's a river there that flows through a  forest, and in the middle of the forest there is a small island on  which stands the gold pot in which grows the Magic Flower.\"    \"How did you get to the island?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Glass cats can't  swim.\"    \"No, but I'm not afraid of water,\" was the reply.  \"I just walked  across the river on the bottom.\"    \"Under the water?\" exclaimed Trot.    The cat gave her a scornful look.    \"How could I walk OVER the water on the BOTTOM of the river?  If you  were transparent, anyone could see YOUR brains were not working.  But  I'm sure you could never find the place alone.  It has always been  hidden from the Oz people.\"    \"But you, with your fine pink brains, could find it again, I s'pose,\"  remarked Dorothy.    \"Yes; and if you want that Magic Flower for Ozma, I'll go with you and  show you the way.\"    \"That's lovely of you!\" declared Dorothy.  \"Trot and Cap'n Bill will go  with you, for this is to be their birthday present to Ozma.  While  you're gone I'll have to find something else to give her.\"    \"All right.  Come on, then, Cap'n,\" said the Glass Cat, starting to  move away.    \"Wait a minute,\" begged Trot.  \"How long will we be gone?\"    \"Oh, about a week.\"    \"Then I'll put some things in a basket to take with us,\" said the girl,  and ran into the palace to make her preparations for the journey.          6.  Ozma's Birthday Presents      When Cap'n Bill and Trot and the Glass Cat had started for the hidden  island in the far-off river to get the Magic Flower, Dorothy wondered  again what she could give Ozma on her birthday.  She met the Patchwork  Girl and said:    \"What are you going to give Ozma for a birthday present?\"    \"I've written a song for her,\" answered the strange Patchwork Girl, who  went by the name of \"Scraps,\" and who, through stuffed with cotton, had  a fair assortment of mixed brains.  \"It's a splendid song and the  chorus runs this way:      I am crazy;    You're a daisy,      Ozma dear;    I'm demented;    You're contented,      Ozma dear;    I am patched and gay and glary;    You're a sweet and lovely fairy;    May your birthdays all be happy,      Ozma dear!\"      \"How do you like it, Dorothy?\" inquired the Patchwork Girl.    \"Is it good poetry, Scraps?\" asked Dorothy, doubtfully.    \"It's as good as any ordinary song,\" was the reply.  \"I have given it a  dandy title, too.  I shall call the song: 'When Ozma Has a Birthday,  Everybody's Sure to Be Gay, for She Cannot Help the Fact That She Was  Born.'\"    \"That's a pretty long title, Scraps,\" said Dorothy.    \"That makes it stylish,\" replied the Patchwork Girl, turning a  somersault and alighting on one stuffed foot. \"Now-a-days the titles  are sometimes longer than the songs.\"    Dorothy left her and walked slowly toward the place, where she met the  Tin Woodman just going up the front steps.    \"What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?\" she asked.    \"It's a secret, but I'll tell you,\" replied the Tin Woodman, who was  Emperor of the Winkies.  \"I am having my people make Ozma a lovely  girdle set with beautiful tin nuggets.  Each tin nugget will be  surrounded by a circle of emeralds, just to set it off to good  advantage.  The clasp of the girdle will be pure tin!  Won't that be  fine?\"    \"I'm sure she'll like it,\" said Dorothy.  \"Do you know what I can give  her?\"    \"I haven't the slightest idea, Dorothy.  It took me three months to  think of my own present for Ozma.\"    The girl walked thoughtfully around to the back of the palace, and  presently came upon the famous Scarecrow of Oz, who has having two of  the palace servants stuff his legs with fresh straw.    \"What are you going to give Ozma on her birthday?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I want to surprise her,\" answered the Scarecrow.    \"I won't tell,\" promised Dorothy.    \"Well, I'm having some straw slippers made for her--all straw, mind  you, and braided very artistically.  Ozma has always admired my straw  filling, so I'm sure she'll be pleased with these lovely straw  slippers.\"    \"Ozma will be pleased with anything her loving friends give her,\" said  the girl.  \"What I'M worried about, Scarecrow, is what to give Ozma  that she hasn't got already.\"    \"That's what worried me, until I thought of the slippers,\" said the  Scarecrow.  \"You'll have to THINK, Dorothy; that's the only way to get  a good idea.  If I hadn't such wonderful brains, I'd never have thought  of those straw foot-decorations.\"    Dorothy left him and went to her room, where she sat down and tried to  think hard.  A Pink Kitten was curled up on the window-sill and Dorothy  asked her:    \"What can I give Ozma for her birthday present?\"    \"Oh, give her some milk,\" replied the Pink Kitten; \"that's the nicest  thing I know of.\"    A fuzzy little black dog had squatted down at Dorothy's feet and now  looked up at her with intelligent eyes.    \"Tell me, Toto,\" said the girl; \"what would Ozma like best for a  birthday present?\"    The little black dog wagged his tail.    \"Your love,\" said he.  \"Ozma wants to be loved more than anything else.\"    \"But I already love her, Toto!\"    \"Then tell her you love her twice as much as you ever did before.\"    \"That wouldn't be true,\" objected Dorothy, \"for I've always loved her  as much as I could, and, really, Toto, I want to give Ozma some  PRESENT, 'cause everyone else will give her a present.\"    \"Let me see,\" said Toto.  \"How would it be to give her that useless  Pink Kitten?\"    \"No, Toto; that wouldn't do.\"    \"Then six kisses.\"    \"No; that's no present.\"    \"Well, I guess you'll have to figure it out for yourself, Dorothy,\"  said the little dog.  \"To MY notion you're more particular than Ozma  will be.\"    Dorothy decided that if anyone could help her it would be Glinda the  Good, the wonderful Sorceress of Oz who was Ozma's faithful subject and  friend.  But Glinda's castle was in the Quadling Country and quite a  journey from the Emerald City.    So the little girl went to Ozma and asked permission to use the Wooden  Sawhorse and the royal Red Wagon to pay a visit to Glinda, and the girl  Ruler kissed Princess Dorothy and graciously granted permission.    The Wooden Sawhorse was one of the most remarkable creatures in Oz.  Its body was a small log and its legs were limbs of trees stuck in the  body.  Its eyes were knots, its mouth was sawed in the end of the log  and its ears were two chips.  A small branch had been left at the rear  end of the log to serve as a tail.    Ozma herself, during one of her early adventures, had brought this  wooden horse to life, and so she was much attached to the queer animal  and had shod the bottoms of its wooden legs with plates of gold so they  would not wear out.  The Sawhorse was a swift and willing traveler, and  though it could talk if need arose, it seldom said anything unless  spoken to.  When the Sawhorse was harnessed to the Red Wagon there were  no reins to guide him because all that was needed was to tell him where  to go.    Dorothy now told him to go to Glinda's Castle and the Sawhorse carried  her there with marvelous speed.    \"Glinda,\" said Dorothy, when she had been greeted by the Sorceress, who  was tall and stately, with handsome and dignified features and dressed  in a splendid and becoming gown, \"what are you going to give Ozma for a  birthday present?\"    The Sorceress smiled and answered:    \"Come into my patio and I will show you.\"    So they entered a place that was surrounded by the wings of the great  castle but had no roof, and was filled with flowers and fountains and  exquisite statuary and many settees and chairs of polished marble or  filigree gold.  Here there were gathered fifty beautiful young girls,  Glinda's handmaids, who had been selected from all parts of the Land of  Oz on account of their wit and beauty and sweet dispositions.  It was a  great honor to be made one of Glinda's handmaidens.    When Dorothy followed the Sorceress into this delightful patio all the  fifty girls were busily weaving, and their shuttles were filled with a  sparkling green spun glass such as the little girl had never seen  before.    \"What is it, Glinda?\" she asked.    \"One of my recent discoveries,\" explained the Sorceress.  \"I have found  a way to make threads from emeralds, by softening the stones and then  spinning them into long, silken"]]]
