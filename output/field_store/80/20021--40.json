But  of those that do return, what perils beset their nests, even in the most  favored localities! The cabins of the early settlers, when the country  was swarming with hostile Indians, were not surrounded by such dangers.  The tender households of the birds are not only exposed to hostile  Indians in the shape of cats and collectors, but to numerous murderous  and bloodthirsty animals, against whom they have no defense but  concealment. They lead the darkest kind of pioneer life, even in our  gardens and orchards, and under the walls of our houses. Not a day or a  night passes, from the time the eggs are laid till the young are flown,  when the chances are not greatly in favor of the nest being rifled and  its contents devoured,--by owls, skunks, minks, and coons at night, and  by crows, jays, squirrels, weasels, snakes, and rats during the day.  Infancy, we say, is hedged about by many perils; but the infancy of  birds is cradled and pillowed in peril. An old Michigan settler told  me that the first six children that were born to him died; malaria and  teething invariably carried them off when they had reached a certain  age; but other children were born, the country improved, and by and by  the babies weathered the critical period and the next six lived and grew  up. The birds, too, would no doubt persevere six times and twice six  times, if the season were long enough, and finally rear their family,  but the waning summer cuts them short, and but a few species have the  heart and strength to make even the third trial.    The first nest-builders in spring, like the first settlers near hostile  tribes, suffer the most casualties. A large portion of the nests of  April and May are destroyed; their enemies have been many months without  eggs and their appetites are keen for them. It is a time, too, when  other food is scarce, and the crows and squirrels are hard put. But the  second nests of June, and still more the nests of July and August, are  seldom molested. It is rarely that the nest of the goldfinch or the  cedar-bird is harried.    My neighborhood on the Hudson is perhaps exceptionally unfavorable as  a breeding haunt for birds, owing to the abundance of fish-crows and  of red squirrels; and the season of which this chapter is mainly a  chronicle, the season of 1881, seems to have been a black-letter one  even for this place, for at least nine nests out of every ten that I  observed during that spring and summer failed of their proper issue.  From the first nest I noted, which was that of a bluebird,--built  (very imprudently I thought at the time) in a squirrel-hole in a decayed  apple-tree, about the last of April, and which came to naught, even  the mother-bird, I suspect, perishing by a violent death,--to the last,  which was that of a snow-bird, observed in August, among the Catskills,  deftly concealed in a mossy bank by the side of a road that skirted a  wood, where the tall thimble blackberries grew in abundance, from which  the last young one was taken, when it was about half grown, by some  nocturnal walker or daylight prowler, some untoward fate seemed hovering  about them. It was a season of calamities, of violent deaths, of pillage  and massacre, among our feathered neighbors. For the first time I  noticed that the orioles were not safe in their strong, pendent nests.  Three broods were started in the apple-trees, only a few yards from  the house, where, for previous seasons, the birds had nested without  molestation; but this time the young were all destroyed when about half  grown. Their chirping and chattering, which was so noticeable one day,  suddenly ceased the next. The nests were probably plundered at night,  and doubtless by the little red screech-owl, which I know is a denizen  of these old orchards, living in the deeper cavities of the trees. The  owl could alight on the top of the nest, and easily thrust his murderous  claw down into its long pocket and seize the young and draw them forth.  The tragedy of one of the nests was heightened, or at least made more  palpable, by one of the half-fledged birds, either in its attempt to  escape or while in the clutches of the enemy, being caught and entangled  in one of the horse-hairs by which the nest was stayed and held to the  limb above. There it hung bruised and dead, gibbeted to its own cradle.  This nest was the theatre of another little tragedy later in the season.  Some time in August a bluebird, indulging its propensity to peep and  pry into holes and crevices, alighted upon it and probably inspected the  interior; but by some unlucky move it got its wings entangled in this  same fatal horse-hair. Its efforts to free itself appeared only to  result in its being more securely and hopelessly bound; and there it  perished; and there its form, dried and embalmed by the summer heats,  was yet hanging in September, the outspread wings and plumage showing  nearly as bright as in life.    A correspondent writes me that one of his orioles got entangled in a  cord while building her nest, and that though by the aid of a ladder  he reached and liberated her, she died soon afterward. He also found  a \"chippie\" (called also \"hair bird\") suspended from a branch by a  horse-hair, beneath a partly constructed nest. I heard of a cedar-bird  caught and destroyed in the same way, and of two young bluebirds,  around whose legs a horse-hair had become so tightly wound that the legs  withered up and dropped off. The birds became fledged, and left the nest  with the others. Such tragedies are probably quite common.    Before the advent of civilization in this country, the oriole probably  built a much deeper nest than it usually does at present. When now it  builds in remote trees and along the borders of the woods, its nest,  I have noticed, is long and gourd-shaped; but in orchards and near  dwellings it is only a deep cup or pouch. It shortens it up in  proportion as the danger lessens. Probably a succession of disastrous  years, like the one under review, would cause it to lengthen it again  beyond the reach of owl's talons or jay-bird's beak.    The first song-sparrow's nest I observed in the spring of 1881 was in  the field under a fragment of a board, the board being raised from the  ground a couple of inches by two poles. It had its full complement of  eggs, and probably sent forth a brood of young birds, though as to this  I cannot speak positively, as I neglected to observe it further. It was  well sheltered and concealed, and was not easily come at by any of its  natural enemies, save snakes and weasels. But concealment often avails  little. In May, a song-sparrow, that had evidently met with disaster  earlier in the season, built its nest in a thick mass of woodbine  against the side of my house, about fifteen feet from the ground.  Perhaps it took the hint from its cousin, the English sparrow. The nest  was admirably placed, protected from the storms by the overhanging  eaves and from all eyes by the thick screen of leaves. Only by patiently  watching the suspicious bird, as she lingered near with food in her  beak, did I discover its whereabouts. That brood is safe, I thought,  beyond doubt. But it was not; the nest was pillaged one night, either  by an owl, or else by a rat that had climbed into the vine, seeking  an entrance to the house. The mother-bird, after reflecting upon her  ill-luck about a week, seemed to resolve to try a different system of  tactics and to throw all appearances of concealment aside. She built a  nest few yards from the house beside the drive, upon a smooth piece  of greensward. There was not a weed or a shrub or anything whatever to  conceal it or mark its site. The structure was completed and incubation  had begun before I discovered what was going on. \"Well, well,\" I said,  looking down upon the bird almost at my feet, \"this is going to the  other extreme indeed; now, the cats will have you.\" The desperate little  bird sat there day after day, looking like a brown leaf pressed down in  the short green grass. As the weather grew hot, her position became very  trying. It was no longer a question of keeping the eggs warm, but of  keeping them from roasting. The sun had no mercy on her, and she fairly  panted in the middle of the day. In such an emergency the male robin  has been known to perch above the sitting female and shade her with his  outstretched wings. But in this case there was no perch for the male  bird, had he been disposed to make a sunshade of himself. I thought to  lend a hand in this direction myself, and so stuck a leafy twig beside  the nest. This was probably an unwise interference; it guided disaster  to the spot; the nest was broken up, and the mother-bird was probably  caught, as I never saw her afterward.    For several previous summers a pair of kingbirds had reared, unmolested,  a brood of young in an apple-tree, only a few yards from the house; but  during this season disaster overtook them also. The nest was completed,  the eggs laid, and incubation had begun, when, one morning about  sunrise, I heard cries of distress and alarm proceed from the old  apple-tree. Looking out of the window I saw a crow, which I knew to be a  fish-crow, perched upon the edge of the nest, hastily bolting the eggs.  The parent birds, usually so ready for the attack, seemed over-come  with grief and alarm. They fluttered about in the most helpless and  bewildered manner, and it was not till the robber fled on my approach  that they recovered themselves and charged upon him. The crow scurried  away with upturned, threatening head, the furious kingbirds fairly upon  his back. The pair lingered around their desecrated nest for several  days, almost silent, and saddened by their loss, and then disappeared.  They probably made another trial elsewhere.    The fish-crow only fishes when it has destroyed all the eggs and young  birds it can find.

Fold number one  back toward the right, making at the fold a right-angled triangle. Fold  the strip down again towards you, making another triangle which is  folded back to the left on the first one. Slip the end of the strip  under the square next to it and cut it off. Proceed in the same way with  three, five, and seven. Then turn the form over and fold the strips two,  four, six, and eight in the same way, cutting off the strips when  finished. Many of these stars can be joined to make mats, baskets,  picture frames, etc. They are pretty when made of gilt or colored paper  for Christmas decorations.    [Sidenote: _Sequence weaving_]    Pattern number three, a bookmark, is made like the first, except that  eight strips of sixteen-inch length are used and the strips woven at  right and left are finished as directed for the mat. Number four is  another form like this, with the long ends back and front slipped  through squares to form a napkin ring. Number five is a six-inch mat  made of twelve twenty-inch strips. Weave six double strips left and  right into two strips and then add four to make the square. To finish  the edge cut off the _under_ one of each double strip, fold the upper  one over it and then slip it under the square which comes next, cutting  it off even. Strips of felt can be woven in this way for table mats or  holders.    The sixth pattern is a pencil holder or a basket, as you may wish. It  may be round or square on the bottom--in the latter case the sides are  creased to form a square prism. Double twelve twenty-four-inch strips,  weave eight right and left into four; finish one long edge for the top  of the basket as you did the edge for the mat. Bend in the form of a  ring and slip the ends as you did for the napkin ring, cutting them off.  To make the bottom, crease all the projecting ends in and weave together  as you did the second part of number two only double, and fasten the  strips on the _outside_ of the basket. This makes a good waste basket  for the doll house. With a cover it would make a fine hamper for Miss  Dolly's clothes.    [Illustration: _Examples of splint work_]    [Sidenote: _Weaving with splints_]    This free weaving leads directly to weaving with splints. These are much  thinner than slats and can be obtained at the kindergarten supply  stores. Many beautiful things can be made with splints. They are easily  dyed at home and many pleasing combinations of color can be obtained in  this way. Celluloid strips make beautiful boxes and baskets.    [Sidenote: \"_Jacob's ladder_\"]    A delightful exercise with the small children is the making of a  \"Jacob's ladder,\" or \"Pussy-cat stairs,\" as they are often called. Fold  a forty-inch strip of paper, one inch wide, so as to form a right-angle  in the middle. Or, if a longer ladder be desired, place one end of a  forty-inch strip over the end of another one, at right angles, and  fasten with a drop of paste. Fold from left to right, one strip upon the  other, until you come to the end; then pull out, and behold the stairs!  The fat and clumsy little fingers will work patiently a long time to  achieve this charming result, and much skill of hand will be gained in  the doing. Use colored paper for this whenever possible.    [Illustration: _A skirt for winter_]    [Illustration: _A mitten and a cap_]    The illustrations on this and on the following page show some  fascinating work for little hands. The looms are made of heavy  pasteboard cut in notches, in which the warp of the same material as  the woof is strung. Care should be taken to keep the warp straight, and  to finish all the edges well. The articles in the illustrations were  made by first-grade children in the Ericcson School, St. Paul, Minn.    [Illustration: _A sweater for the doll_]          Chapter Four    METHODS OF STRINGING WARP      [Sidenote: _Warp of three widths_]    The adjustable loom can be strung with warp of three widths, one-half  inch, three-eighths inch, and three-sixteenths inch, thus giving  opportunity for a variety of materials.    For heavy rags, candle wicking, etc., wind the warp strings around three  teeth in the head and foot pieces. This will give a warp of one-half  inch--that is, one-half inch from one string to the other.    For silk, silkoline, finer rags, carpet ravelings, double wool, etc.,  wind the warp strings around two teeth, thus making a warp of  three-eighths inches.    [Sidenote: _Kindergarten patterns_]    For double wool, worsted, rope silk, chenille, or raffia, where one  wishes to reproduce kindergarten designs, as in paper-weaving, place the  warp strings around one tooth only. This makes a close warp of  three-sixteenths inch, which helps to form the design with the woof  threads. In this case the warp should be of the same material as the  woof. In kindergarten patterns the woof threads determine the color  effect. It is better to have the children weave the pattern first with  practice mats and slats, particularly if they have never had experience  in the kindergarten. Suggestions for weaving kindergarten designs are  given under the head of _Raffia_.    [Sidenote: _Plaids_]    For a plaid effect, string the warp at regular intervals, with different  colors. Then weave the same colors at equal intervals to form the plaid.  (See illustrations, pages 92, 98, and 101.) Shawls, carriage blankets,  etc., woven in this way are very attractive.    [Sidenote: _Stripes_]    A striped warp is strung in the same way. (See illustrations, pages 101  and 117.) The stripes could be continued through the mat, if desired, by  weaving only _one_ color in the woof. By weaving _two_ colors squares  are obtained such as those seen in the corners.    [Sidenote: _Materials for warp_]    For weaving with carpet ravelings or rags, and sometimes double wool,  where a plain effect is desired, the warp should be of common twine, as  near the color of the work as possible. Carpet thread is good,  especially for the double warp in Turkish rugs. Balls of warp string can  be obtained at department stores. Oriental cord comes in several colors,  and can be had at a few cents a ball at the notion and stationery  counters in department stores.    [Sidenote: _How to string a warp_]    The warp should always be one continuous string, and several inches  should be left at each end in order to fasten securely when the work is  finished. If preferred, the warp ends can be fastened before the weaving  is commenced. Care should be taken to place the first and last strings  of the warp directly _over_ the rods, and, in weaving, to pass the woof  threads entirely around the _rods and strings_ to insure straight edges.  The ends of wool warp threads should be wound in and out of the notches  to the right and left of rods, to fasten them until the weaving is  finished. It sometimes happens that little children, and more especially  those who are blind, pull up the warp strings when near the end of the  work. In such cases it is a good plan to pass a rubber band _over_ the  warp strings at the top of the loom and _behind_ the bars, back of the  head piece, making it set up close by putting it around one tooth at  each end. In this way the warp strings cannot possibly slip out of the  notches.    [Sidenote: _Splicing with a weaver's knot_]    [Sidenote: _A raffia warp_]    Some teachers splice the warp with a weaver's knot, an illustration of  which can be seen in any large dictionary. The continuous string is to  be preferred, however, as experience has proved that even a weaver's  knot will sometimes fail to stand the stress of weaving. It is very  difficult to splice a warp of raffia. It is better to knot the warp  threads in pairs (see directions, page 46), leaving two or three inches  beyond the head and foot. These ends may be used for a fringe by tearing  very fine, or they may be run down in the woven part with a darning  needle, as rattan is run down in basket work.    [Sidenote: _To fasten wool or silk warp strings_]    [Sidenote: _When the warp is correct_]    When the weaving is done and the mat lifted from the loom, the ends of  the wool warp strings can be run in along the sides with a tape needle.  If the warp be of twine, it is better to tie the end to the next warp  string and allow the fringe to cover the knot; or, as in the case of  silkoline, the woof strips can be caught over the warp strings with silk  of the same color in order to hide them. Only experience can teach the  tightness with which a warp should be strung. Worsted, carpet thread and  twine will stretch as the work progresses, and raffia will not. If the  warp be too loose the work will be uneven and the strings will slip out  of the notches. If it be too tight it will be difficult to finish the  last two or three inches and the woof threads will look crowded. The  best test is to place the hand upon the warp before commencing to weave.  If it feels firm and does not push down too easily, but springs  slightly beneath the hand, it is probably correct.    [Sidenote: _To string a warp for fringe_]    [Sidenote: _To string the warp threads in pairs_]    Where the warp is of the same material as the woof and it is desired to  extend it to form a fringe, it can be done in the following manner:  After the loom is adjusted for the size required, cut the warp strings  so as to allow two or three inches beyond the head and foot pieces. If  you intend to knot the fringe in some fanciful way after the weaving is  finished, allow four or five inches. Take two threads, knot so as to  leave the required length for fringe below the foot piece, then pass  around one or two teeth, as the case may be, draw tightly to the head  piece and knot firmly on the upper side, leaving a fringe of the same  length there. Knot the strings in pairs in this way until the"]]]
