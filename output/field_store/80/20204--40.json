God Without and God Within        That leads us to the next point, the relation of God without to  God within. To the yogi, who is the very type of Hindu thought,  there is no definite proof of God save the witness of the Self  within to His existence, and his idea of finding the proof of God  is that you should strip away from your consciousness all  limitations, and thus reach the stage where you have pure  consciousness--save a veil of the thin nirvanic matter. Then you  know that God is. So you read in the Upanishad: \"Whose only proof  is the witness of the Self.\" This is very different from Western  methods of thought, which try to demonstrate God by a process of  argument. The Hindu will tell you that you cannot demonstrate God  by any argument or reasoning; He is above and beyond reasoning,  and although the reason may guide you on the way, it will not  prove to demonstration that God is. The only way you can know Him  is by diving into yourself. There you will find Him, and know  that He is without as well as within you; and Yoga is a system  that enables you to get rid of everything from consciousness that  is not God, save that one veil of the nirvanic atom, and so to  know that God is, with an unshakable certainty of conviction. To  the Hindu that inner conviction is the only thing worthy to be  called faith, and this gives you the reason why faith is said to  be beyond reason, and so is often confused with credulity. Faith  is beyond reason, because it is the testimony of the Self to  himself, that conviction of existence as Self, of which reason is  only one of the outer manifestations; and the only true faith is  that inner conviction, which no argument can either strengthen or  weaken, of the innermost Self of you, that of which alone you are  entirely sure. It is the aim of Yoga to enable you to reach that  Self constantly not by a sudden glimpse of intuition, but  steadily, unshakably, and unchangeably, and when that Self is  reached, then the question: \"Is there a God?\" can never again  come into the. human mind.          Changes of Consciousness and Vibrations of Matter        It is necessary to understand something about that consciousness  which is your Self, and about the matter which is the envelope of  consciousness, but which the Self so often identifies with  himself. The great characteristic of consciousness is change,  with a foundation of certainty that it is. The consciousness of  existence never changes, but beyond this all is change, and only  by the changes does consciousness become Self-consciousness.  Consciousness is an everchanging thing, circling round one idea  that never changes--Self-existence. The consciousness itself is  not changed by any change of position or place. It only changes  its states within itself.    In matter, every change of state is brought about by change of  place. A change of consciousness is a change of a state; a change  of matter is a change of place. Moreover, every change of state  in consciousness is related to vibrations of matter in its  vehicle. When matter is examined, we find three fundamental  qualities--rhythm, mobility, stability--sattva, rajas, tamas.  Sattva is rhythm, vibration. It is more than; rajas, or mobility.  It is a regulated movement, a swinging from one side to the other  over a definite distance, a length of wave, a vibration.    The question is often put: \"How can things in such different  categories, as matter and Spirit, affect each other? Can we  bridge that great gulf which some say can never be crossed?\" Yes,  the Indian has crossed it, or rather, has shown that there is no  gulf. To the Indian, matter and Spirit are not only the two  phases of the One, but, by a subtle analysis of the relation  between consciousness and matter, he sees that in every universe  the LOGOS imposes upon matter a certain definite relation of  rhythms, every vibration of matter corresponding to a change in  consciousness. There is no change in consciousness, however  subtle, that has not appropriated to it a vibration in matter;  there is no vibration in matter, however swift or delicate, which  has not correlated to it a certain change in consciousness. That  is the first great work of the LOGOS, which the Hindu scriptures  trace out in the building of the atom, the Tanmatra, \" the  measure of That,\" the measure of consciousness. He who is  consciousness imposes on his material the answer to every change  in consciousness, and that is an infinite number of vibrations.  So that between the Self and his sheaths there is this invariable  relation: the change in consciousness and the vibration of  matter, and vice versa. That makes it possible for the Self to  know the Not-Self.    These correspondences are utilised in Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga,  the Kingly Yoga and the Yoga of Resolve. The Raja Yoga seeks to  control the changes in consciousness, and by this control to rule  the material vehicles. The Hatha Yoga seeks to control the  vibrations of matter, and by this control to evoke the desired    changes in consciousness. The weak point in Hatha Yoga is that  action on this line cannot reach beyond the astral plane, and the  great strain imposed on the comparatively intractable matter of  the physical plane sometimes leads to atrophy of the very organs,  the activity of which is necessary for effecting the changes in  consciousness that would be useful. The Hatha Yogi gains control  over the bodily organs with which the waking consciousness no  longer concerns itself, having relinquished them to its lower  part, the \" subconsciousness', This is often useful as regards  the prevention of disease, but serves no higher purpose. When he  begins to work on the brain centres connected with ordinary  consciousness, and still more when he touches those connected  with the super-consciousness, he enters a dangerous region, and  is more likely to paralyse than to evolve.    That relation alone it is which makes matter cognizable; the  change in the thinker is answered by a change outside, and his  answer to it and the change in it that he makes by his. answer  re-arrange again the matter of the body which is his envelope.  Hence the rhythmic changes in matter are rightly called its  cognizability. Matter may be known by consciousness, because of  this unchanging relation between the two sides of the manifest  LOGOS who is one, and the Self becomes aware of changes within  himself, and thus of those of the external words to which those  changes are related.          Mind        What is mind ? From the yogic standpoint it is simply the  individualized consciousness, the whole of it, the whole of your  consciousness including your activities which the Western  psychologist puts outside mind. Only on the basis of Eastern  psychology is Yoga possible. How shall we describe this  individualized consciousness? First, it is aware of things.  Becoming aware of them, it desires them. Desiring them, it tries  to attain them. So we have the three aspects of consciousness--  intelligence, desire, activity. On the physical plane, activity  predominates, although desire and thought are present. On the  astral plane, desire predominates, and thought and activity are  subject to desire. On the mental plane; intelligence is the  dominant note, desire and activity are subject to it. Go to the  buddhic plane, and cognition, as pure reason, predominates, and  so on. Each quality is present all the time, but one  predominates. So with the matter that belongs to them. In your  combinations of matter you get rhythmic, active, or stable ones;  and according to the combinations of matter in your bodies will  be the conditions of the activity of the whole of these in  consciousness. To practice Yoga you must build your bodies of the  rhythmic combinations, with activity and inertia less apparent.  The yogi wants to make his body match his mind.          Stages of  Mind        The mind has five stages, Patanjali tells us, and Vyasa comments  that \"these stages of mind are on every plane\". The first stage  is the stage in which the mind is flung about, the Kshipta stage;  it is the butterfly mind, the early stage of humanity, or, in  man, the mind of the child, darting constantly from one object to  another. It corresponds to activity on the physical plane. The  next is the confused stage, Mudha, equivalent to the stage of the  youth, swayed by emotions, bewildered by them; he begins to feel  he is ignorant--a state beyond the fickleness of the child--a  characteristic state, corresponding to activity in the astral  world. Then comes the state of preoccupation, or infatuation,  Vikshipta, the state of the man possessed by an idea--love,  ambition, or what not. He is no longer a confused youth, but a  man with a clear aim, and an idea possesses him. It may be either  the fixed idea of the madman, or the fixed idea which makes the  hero or the saint; but in any case he is possessed by the idea.  The quality of the idea, its truth or falsehood, makes the  difference between the maniac and the martyr.    Maniac or martyr, he is under the spell of a fixed idea. No  reasoning avails against it. If he has assured himself that he is  made of glass, no amount of argument will convince him to the  contrary. He will always regard himself as being as brittle as  glass. That is a fixed idea which is false. But there is a fixed  idea which makes the hero and the martyr. For some great truth  dearer than life is everything thrown aside. He is possessed by  it, dominated by it, and he goes to death gladly for it. That  state is said to be approaching Yoga, for such a man is becoming  concentrated, even if only possessed by one idea. This stage  corresponds to activity on the lower mental plane. Where the man  possesses the idea, instead of being possessed by it, that  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4290"],[0,"The Dominion in 1983 (#5)"],[1,"pleasure in governing or in being  overgoverned--not a special aptitude or genius for governing--must  have been very common among them. From the alarming blunders  made in directing public affairs, and from the manner in which  beneficial measures were opposed by the party out of office, it  appears quite certain that the instincts of true statesmanship did  not animate all classes then as now. Nevertheless our forefathers  went into the work of governing themselves and each other with  a great deal of vim. They had no well drawn out formulae to  work upon as we have, but they went at things in a sort of  rule-of-thumb, rough-and-ready style, and when one party had  dragged the country into the mire, the other dragged it out again.  It was customary for the party that was out of office to say that  the party that was in was corrupt and venal--that every man of it  was a liar, was a thief, was taking bribes, would soon be kicked  out, etc. Then the party that was in had to say that the party that  was out should look to its own sins and remember that everyone of  its men when they were in proved himself incapable, insensible to  every feeling of shame, with no susceptibilities except in his  pocket, corrupt in every fibre, being justly rewarded when hurled  from office by an indignant people, etc., etc. The wonder is that  the country ever got governed at all, but it seems that all public  men who had any fixed and sensible ideas and wished to see them  carried out, had to make themselves callous, pachydermatous,  hardened against this offensive mud-slinging. Of course politics  did not elevate the man, nor the man politics, while things went on  thus. A general demoralization and lowering of the tone of public  opinion naturally resulted, which did not improve till the stirring  events of the summer of 1887 brought men to their senses again.  The number of members sent to Parliament was something so enormous,  that it seems as if the people must have had a perfect mania for  being represented. Nowadays we get along splendidly with only  fifteen members (one for each Province) and a speaker. Formerly  several hundred was not thought too many, and before the  constitution was revised in 1935, there were actually over seven  hundred representatives assembled at Ottawa every year. Perhaps  this was all right under the circumstances, as there did not then  exist any organization for training men for Parliamentary duties,  or selecting them for candidature such as now exists; so there was  safety in numbers, though the floods of talk must at times have  been overwhelming. Besides the Central Parliament at Ottawa, there  was a Local Parliament to every Province, and in some Provinces two  Houses. It seems a mystery to us, now, how any measure could be got  through in less than twelve months, but our forefathers apparently  took pleasure in interminable harangues and oceans of verbosity,  and prominent men contrived to make themselves heard above the  universal clatter of tongues, so that good measures got pushed  through somehow to the satisfaction of a much-enduring public.  Nowadays our fifteen members put by as much work in two days as  would have kept an old Parliament talking for two years. Provincial  Parliaments, with their crowds of M.P.P's, were abolished in 1935,  and it was then also that the number of members at Ottawa was  reduced from the absurd total of 750 to 15, and the round million  or so which they cost the country saved. Members are not now paid;  the honor of the position is sufficient emolument. When these and  other changes were made, the expenses of government were enormously  reduced, so much so, that after ten years, that is in 1945, taxes  were abolished altogether, and from that time forward not a cent of  taxation has been put upon the people. The revenue is now obtained  in this way. Up to 1935 the revenue of the country stood at  something over $150,000,000. When the constitution was changed  the expenses of government were lessened to $50,000,000. It was  then agreed that for ten years longer the revenue should remain  at $150,000,000 (people were prosperous and willing enough to have  contributed double), so that every year of the ten $100,000,000  might be invested. Thus at the end of ten years the Government  possessed a capital of $1,000,000,000, and the interest of this  constitutes our present revenue. If any great public works are  being carried out, and more money is required, the municipalities  are appealed to, and public meetings are held. All the great  cities then vie with each other in presenting the Government with  large sums. How the poor over-burdened tax-payer of 1883 would  have rejoiced in all this!    Another great blessing to us is that war has ceased all the world  over. It became, at last, too destructive to be indulged in at all.  During the last great European war in 1932, while three emperors,  two kings and several princes were parleying together, a monster  oxyhydrogen shell exploded near them and created fearful havoc.  All the royal personages were blown to atoms, as were also many of  their attendants. Their armies hardly had a chance of getting near  each other, so fearful was the execution of the shells. Since then  the world has been free from war, and, but for gathering clouds in  Asia, would seem likely to remain so. Anyhow, we in Canada, have  not the shadow of a standing army, nor a single keel to represent  a navy. We are too well occupied to wish to be aggressive, and no  power except the United States could ever attack us, and even if  Americans coveted our possessions they are not likely to resort to  such an old-fashioned expedient as warfare to gain them. They could  only annex us by so improving their constitution, as to make it  plainly very much superior to ours. If they ever do this (and as  yet there are no signs of it) there might be some chance of a  union. At present the chances are all the other way. The only  sort of union that is quite likely to come about is the joining  by the Americans of the United Empire, or Confederation of all  English-speaking nations, with which we have been connected for  some years. The seat of the Imperial Government has hitherto been  London, but British influence has made such strides in the East  that there is every probability of another city being chosen  for the capital, and of the seat of Government being made more  central. Should one of the now restored ancient cities of  the East become the metropolis of this glorious Imperial  Confederation, the United States would certainly come into  the Confederation, as great numbers of Americans have already  migrated to the Orient.    A word on the changes which have come over the East will not be  inappropriate, lest we should be tempted to boast too much of the  progress of Canada. Ever since the conquest of Egypt by the British,  as long ago as 1882, Anglo-Saxon institutions have been gaining  ground from the Nile to the Euphrates, and from the Euphrates to  the Indus. Soon after the great stroke of diplomacy in 1887, by  which Great Britain practically became ruler of all this vast  territory, the railroad was introduced, and before many years had  passed the railroad system of Europe was linked with that of India.  The pent-up riches of the fertile Euphrates valley thenceforth  began to find channels of commerce, and to be distributed through  less fertile regions. The ancient historic cities of these lands,  Damascus especially, began at once to increase. Jerusalem, as soon  as the Turk departed and the Anglo-Saxon entered, was purified,  cleansed, and finally rebuilt. Great numbers of Jews from all parts  of the world then returned and gave the city the benefit of their  wealth, but all the commerce of the East keeps in the hands of  Britons and Americans. English is, therefore, the chief language  spoken from Beyrout to Bombay.    There is, however, a great cloud hanging over the East which causes  dismay to thinking men, and threatens to mar the general prosperity  of all the lands. Great as has been the increase of the Anglo-Saxon  race, the numbers of the Sclavonic race have kept pace. The Sclavs,  unfortunately, retain much of their old brutish disposition and  ferocity in the midst of all the civilizing influences of modern  times, so that statesmen foresee an inevitable collision in the  not distant future between the Sclav and the Anglo-Saxon. It is  disheartening in these days of splendid progress, when we had  hoped that war was for ever banished from the world, to find that  humanity has yet to endure the old horrors once more. How fearful  these horrors will be, and how great the destruction of life, it is  hardly possible to conceive, so terrible are the forces at man's  command nowadays, if he uses them simply for destructive purposes.  The Sclav has spread from South-Eastern Europe and multiplied  greatly in Asia, till his boundaries are coterminous with British  territory, and it is his inveterate aggressive disposition which  causes all the gloomy forebodings. Before we return to our own  happy Canada, let us glance at Africa, the \"dark continent\" of the  last century. Civilization has long penetrated to the upper waters  of the Nile, and to the great fresh water lakes which rival our  Huron and Superior. The beautiful country in which the mighty  Congo and the Nile take their rise, is all open to the world's  commerce, and highways now exist stretching from Alexandria  through these magnificent regions to the Transvaal and the Cape.  Madagascar, fair, fertile and wealthy, has developed, under  Anglo-Saxon influence, her wonderful latent resources for all  men's good. In addition to mineral treasures she had wealth to  bestow in the shape of healing plants, whose benefits were greater  to suffering humanity than tons of gold and silver. The botanical  gardens at New Westminster, and the conservatories at Churchill,  are "]]]
