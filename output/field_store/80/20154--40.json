With the help of the hooks on their toes it does not matter to  them whether they run upward, downward, or sidewise; and they can  stretch their bodies away from their feet at some very queer angles.  Their long bills penetrate into deep holes in the thick bark of the  tree trunks and older limbs and bring forth from their hiding places  insects that would escape almost every other bird except the brown  creeper and the woodpecker. Of course, when you see any feathered  acrobat performing in the trees, you know he is working hard to pick  up a dinner, not exercising merely for fun. The most familiar  nuthatch, in the eastern United States, is the one with the white  breast; but in the Northern States and Canada there is another common  winter neighbour, a smaller compactly feathered, bluish gray gymnast  with a pale rusty breast, a conspicuous black line running apparently  through his eye from the base of his bill to the nape of his neck, and  heavy white eyebrows. This is the hardy little red-breasted nuthatch.  His voice is pitched rather high and his drawling notes seem to come  from a lazy bird instead of one of the most vigorous and spry little  creatures in the wood. The {27} nasal _ank-ank_ of his white-breasted  cousin is uttered, too, without expression, as if the bird were  compelled to make a sound once in a while against his will. Both of  these cousins have similar habits. Both are a trifle smaller than the  English sparrow. In summer they merely hide away in the woods to nest,  for they are not migrants. It is only when nesting duties are over in  the autumn that they become neighbourly.    Who gave them their queer name? A hatchet would be a rather clumsy  tool for us to use in opening a nut, but these birds have a  convenient, ever-ready one in their long, stout, sharply pointed bills  with which they hack apart the small thin-shelled nuts like beech nuts  and hazel nuts, chinquapins and chestnuts, kernels of corn and  sunflower seeds. These they wedge into cracks in the bark just big  enough to hold them. During the summer and early autumn when insects  are plentiful, the nuthatches eat little else; and then they thriftily  store away the other items on their bill of fare, squirrel fashion, so  that when frost kills the insects, they may vary their diet of insect  eggs and grubs with nuts and the larger grain. Flying to the spot  where a nut has been securely wedged, perhaps weeks before, the bird  scores and hacks and pecks it open with his sharp little hatchet,  whose hard blows may be heard far away.    {28}    Although this tool is a great help to the nuthatches in making their  nests, they appear to be quite as ready to accept a deserted  woodpecker's hole as the chickadee with a smaller bill. A natural  cavity will answer, or, if they must, they will make one in some  forest tree. The red-breasted nuthatches have a curious habit of  smearing the entrance to the hole with fir-balsam or pitch. Why do you  suppose they do it? Perhaps they think this will discourage egg  suckers, like snakes, mice, or squirrels; but, in effect, the sticky  gum often pulls the feathers from their own breasts as they go in and  out attending to the wants of their family.      RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET    Count that a red-letter day on your calendar when first you see either  this tiny, dainty sprite, or his next of kin, the golden-crowned  kinglet, fluttering, twinkling about the evergreens. In republican  America we don't often have the chance to meet two crowned heads.  Energetic as wrens, restless as warblers, and as perpetually looking  for insect food, the kinglets flit with a sudden, jerking motion from  twig to twig among the trees and bushes, now on the lawn, now in the  orchard and presently in the hedgerow down the lane. They have a  pretty {29} trick of lifting and flitting their wings every little  while. The bluebird and pine grosbeak have it too, but their much  larger, trembling wings seem far less nervous.    Happily the kinglets are not at all shy; no bird is that is hatched  out so far north that it never sees a human being until it travels  southward to spend the winter. Alas! It is the birds that know us too  well that are often the most afraid. When the leaves are turning  crimson and russet and gold in the autumn, keep a sharp look out for  the plump little grayish, olive green birds that are even smaller than  wrens, and not very much larger than hummingbirds. Although members of  quite a different family--the kinglets are exclusive--they condescend  to join the nuthatches and chickadees in the orchard to help clean the  farmer's fruit trees or pick up a morsel at the free lunch counter in  zero weather. Love or war is necessary to make the king show us his  crown. But vanity or anger is sufficient excuse for lifting the dark  feathers that nearly conceal the beauty spot on the top of his head  when the midget's mind is at ease. If you approach very near--and he  will allow you to almost touch him--you may see the little patch of  brilliant red feathers, it is true, but you will probably get an  unexpected, chattering scolding from the little king as he flies away.    {30}    In the spring his love song is as surprisingly strong in proportion to  his size as the wren's. It seems impossible for such a volume of  mellow flute-like melody to pour from a throat so tiny. Before we have  a chance to hear it again the singer is off with his tiny queen to  nest in some spruce tree beyond the Canadian border.    [Illustration]  The noisy contents of a soap box: a family of house wrens.    [Illustration]  The marsh wren's round cradle swung among the rushes.    {31}        CHAPTER III    A GROUP OF LIVELY SINGERS        House Wren    Carolina Wren    Marsh Wren    Brown Thrasher    Catbird    Mockingbird    {32}    {33}    THE HOUSE WREN    If you want some jolly little neighbours for the summer, invite the  wrens to live near you year after year by putting up small, one-family  box-houses under the eaves of the barn, the cow-shed, or the  chicken-house, on the grape arbour or in the orchard. Beware of a pair  of nesting wrens in a box nailed against a piazza post: they beat any  alarm clock for arousing the family at sunrise.    Save the starch boxes, cover them with strips of bark, or give them  two coats of paint to match the building they are to be nailed on. Cut  a hole that you have marked on one end of each box by drawing a lead  pencil around a silver quarter of a dollar. A larger hole would mean  that English sparrows, who push themselves everywhere where not  invited, would probably take possession of each house as fast as you  nailed it up. Of course the little one-roomed cottages should have a  number of small holes bored on the sides near the top to give the  wrens plenty of fresh air. Have the boxes in place not later than the  first of April--then watch. Would it not be a pity for any would-be  tenants to pass by your home because they could {34} not find a house  to let? Wrens really prefer boxes to the holes in stumps and trees  they used to occupy before there were any white people with thoughtful  children on this continent. But the little tots have been known to  build in tin cans, coat pockets, old shoes, mittens, hats, glass jars,  and even inside a human skull that a medical student hung out in the  sun to bleach!    When you are sound asleep some April morning, a tiny brown bird, just  returned from a long visit south of the Carolinas, will probably  alight on the perch in front of one of your boxes, peep in the  doorhole, enter--although his pert little cocked-up-tail has to be  lowered to let him through--look about with approval, go out, spring  to the roof and pour out of his wee throat a gushing torrent of music.  The song seems to bubble up faster than he can sing. \"Foive notes to  wanst\" was an Irishman's description of it. After the wren's happy  discovery of a place to live, his song will go off in a series of  musical explosions all day long, now from the roof, now from the  clothesposts, the fence, the barn, or the wood-pile. There never was a  more tireless, spirited, brilliant singer. From the intensity of his  feelings, he sometimes droops that expressive little tail of his,  which is usually so erect and saucy.      [Illustration]  Like \"Brer Rabbit\" the catbird is usually \"bred and bawn in a brier patch.\"    [Illustration]  Another tragedy of the nests: what villain ate the catbird's eggs?    {35}    With characteristic energy, he frequently begins to carry twigs into  the house before he finds a mate. The day little Jenny Wren appears on  the scene, how he does sing! Dashing off for more twigs, but stopping  to sing to her every other minute, he helps furnish the cottage  quickly, but, of course, he overdoes--he carries in more twigs and hay  and feathers than the little house can hold, then pulls half of them  out again. Jenny gathers too, for she is a bustling housewife and  arranges matters with neatness and despatch. Neither vermin nor dirt  will she tolerate within her well-kept home. Everything she does to  suit herself pleases her ardent little lover. He applauds her with  song; he flies about after her with a nervous desire to protect; he  seems beside himself with happiness. Let any one pass too near his  best beloved, and he begins to chatter excitedly:  _\"Chit-chit-chit-chit\"_ as much as to say, \"Oh, do go away; go  quickly! Can't you see how nervous and fidgety you make me?\"    If you fancy that Jenny Wren, who is patiently sitting on the little  pinkish chocolate spotted eggs in the centre of her feather bed, is a  demure, angelic creature, you have never seen her attack the sparrow,  nearly twice her size, that dares put his impudent head inside her  door.

Both parties find great profit in this.  There are plenty of provisions in this town, of rice, millet, and  some wheat, which is brought to them from Cambay, and plenty of  fruit, for there are many gardens and orchards. There are here many  of the large-tailed sheep, and of all other meats as above; there  are also oranges, sweet and sour. This King and people have always  been very friendly and obedient to the King of Portugal, and the  Portuguese have always met with much friendship and good reception  amongst them.[20]      ISLAND OF SAN LORENZO.[21]    Opposite these places, in the sea above the Cape of the  Currents,[22] at a distance of eighty leagues, there is a very large  island, which is called San Lorenzo, and which is peopled by  Gentiles, and has in it some towns of Moors. This island has many  kings, both Moors and Gentiles. There is in it much meat, rice, and  millet, and plenty of oranges and lemons, and there is much ginger  in this country, which they do not make use of, except to eat it  almost green. The inhabitants go naked, covering only their middles  with cotton cloths. They do not navigate, nor does any one do so for  them; they have got canoes for fishing on their coast. They are  people of a dark complexion, and have a language of their own. They  frequently are at war with one another, and their arms are azagayes,  very sharp, with their points very well worked; they throw these in  order to wound, and carry several of them in their hands. They are  very well built and active men, and have a good method of wrestling.  There is amongst them silver of inferior quality. Their principal  food is roots, which they sow, and it is called yname,[23] and in  the Indies of Spain it is called maize. The country is very  beautiful and luxuriant in vegetation, and it has very large rivers.  This island is in length from the part of Sofala and Melinde three  hundred leagues, and to the mainland there are sixty leagues.      PENDA, MANFIA, AND ZANZIBAR.    Between this island of San Lorenzo and the continent, not very far  from it, are three islands, which are called one Manfia, another  Zanzibar, and the other Penda;[24] these are inhabited by Moors;  they are very fertile islands, with plenty of provisions, rice,  millet, and flesh, and abundant oranges, lemons, and cedrats. All  the mountains are full of them; they produce many sugar canes, but  do not know how to make sugar. These islands have their kings. The  inhabitants trade with the mainland with their provisions and  fruits; they have small vessels, very loosely and badly made,  without decks, and with a single mast; all their planks are sewn  together with cords of reed or matting, and the sails are of palm  mats. They are very feeble people, with very few and despicable  weapons. In these islands they live in great luxury, and abundance;  they dress in very good cloths of silk and cotton, which they buy in  Mombaza of the merchants from Cambay, who reside there. Their wives  adorn themselves with many jewels of gold from Sofala, and silver,  in chains, ear-rings, bracelets, and ankle rings, and are dressed in  silk stuffs: and they have many mosques, and hold the Alcoran of  Mahomed.      PATE.    After passing Melinde, and going towards India, they cross the Gulf  (because the coast trends inwards) towards the Red Sea, and on the  coast there is a town called Pate,[25] and further on there is  another town of the Moors, called Lamon;[26] all these trade with  the Gentiles of the country, and they are strongly-walled towns of  stone and whitewash, because at times they have to fight with the  Gentiles, who live in the interior of the country.      BRAVA.    Leaving these places, further on along the coast is a town of the  Moors, well walled, and built of good houses of stone and whitewash,  which is called Brava. It has not got a king; it is governed by its  elders,[27] they being honoured and respectable persons. It is a  place of trade, which has already been destroyed by the Portuguese,  with great slaughter of the inhabitants, of whom many were made  captives, and great riches in gold, silver, and other merchandise  were taken here, and those who escaped fled into the country, and  after the place was destroyed they returned to people it.      MAGADOXO.[28]    Leaving the before-mentioned town of Brava, on the coast further on  towards the Red Sea, there is another very large and beautiful town,  called Magadoxo, belonging to the Moors, and it has a king over it,  and is a place of great trade in merchandise. Ships come there from  the kingdom of Cambay and from Aden with stuffs of all sorts, and  with other merchandise of all kinds, and with spices. And they carry  away from there much gold, ivory, beeswax, and other things upon  which they make a profit. In this town there is plenty of meat,  wheat, barley, and horses, and much fruit; it is a very rich place.  All the people speak Arabic; they are dusky, and black, and some of  them white. They are but bad warriors, and use herbs with their  arrows to defend themselves from their enemies.      AFUNI.[29]    Having passed the district and town of Magadoxo, further on along  the coast is another small town of the Moors, called Afuni, in which  there is abundance of meat and provisions. It is a place of little  trade, and has got no port.      CAPE GUARDAFUN.    After passing this place the next after it is Cape Guardafun,[30]  where the coast ends, and trends so as to double towards the Red  Sea. This cape is in the mouth of the Strait of Mecca, and all the  ships which come from India, that is to say, from the kingdom of  Cambay, of Chaul, Dabul, Baticala, and Malabar, Ceylon, Choromandel,  Bengal, Sumatra, Poggru, Tanaseri, Malacca, and China, all come to  meet at this cape, and from it they enter into the before-mentioned  Red Sea with their merchandise for Aden, Berbera, and Zeyla, and  Guida, the port of Mecca, for which ships the ships of the King of  Portugal sometimes go and lie in wait and take them with all their  riches.      MET.    In doubling this Cape of Guardafun, towards the inner part of the  Red Sea, there is, just near the said cape, a town of the Moors  called Met,[31] not very large, where there is plenty of meat; it is  of little trade.      BARBARA.    Further on, on the same coast, is a town of the Moors called  Barbara;[32] it has a port, at which many ships of Adeni and Cambay  touch with their merchandise, and from there those of Cambay carry  away much gold, and ivory, and other things, and those of Aden take  many provisions, meat, honey, and wax, because, as they say, it is a  very abundant country.      ZEYLA.    Having passed this town of Berbara, and going on, entering the Red  Sea, there is another town of the Moors, which is named Zeyla,[33]  which is a good place of trade, whither many ships navigate and sell  their cloths and merchandise. It is very populous, with good houses  of stone and whitewash, and good streets; the houses are covered  with terraces, the dwellers in them are black. They have many  horses, and breed much cattle of all sorts, which they make use of  for milk, and butter, and meat. There is in this country abundance  of wheat, millet, barley, and fruits, which they carry thence to  Aden.      DALAQUA.    After continuing along the coast from the town of Zeyla, there is  another place of the Moors, called Dalaqua,[34] the seaport which is  most made use of by the Abaxins[35] of the country of Prester John.  And all round this place there are much provisions, and much gold  comes there from the country of Prester John.      MASAVA SAVAQUIN[36] AND OTHER PLACES.    Leaving Dalaqua for the interior of the Red Sea, there are Massowa,  Suakin, and other towns of the Moors; and this coast is still called  Arabia Felix, and the Moors call it Barra Ajan,[37] in all which  there is much gold which comes from the interior of the country of  Prester John, whom they call Abexi. All these places on this coast  trade with the country with their cloths and other merchandise, and  they bring from it gold, ivory, honey, wax and slaves; and sometimes  they are at war with them, for they are Christians, and they capture  many of them; and such captives are much valued by the Moors, and  amongst them are worth much more money than other slaves because  they find them sharp and faithful, and well-built men in body, and  when they turn Moors, they become greater emperors than the original  Moors. These Moors of Arabia Felix are all black[38] and good  fighting men; they go bare from the waist upwards, and from thence  downwards they cover themselves with cloths of cotton; and the more  honourable men amongst them wear their cloths over them like  Almalafas,[39] and the women are covered in the same way:[40]...      KINGDOM OF PRESTER JOHN.    Leaving these towns of the Moors and entering into the interior of  the country, the great kingdom of Prester John is to be found, whom  the Moors of Arabia call Abexi;[41] this kingdom is very large, and  peopled with many cities, towns, and villages, with many  inhabitants: and it has many kings subject to it and tributary  kings. And in their country there are many who live in the fields  and mountains, like Beduins: they are black men, very well made:  they have many horses, and make use of them, and are good riders,  and there are great sportsmen and hunters amongst them. Their  provisions are flesh of all kinds, milk, butter, and wheaten bread,  and of these things there is a great abundance. Their clothes are of  hides because the country is wanting in cloths; and there is a law  amongst them by which certain families and ranks of persons may wear  cloths, and the rest of the people may wear only hides well dressed  and tanned. Amongst them there are men and women who have never  drunk water, but only milk, which greatly supports them, and  quenches the thirst, on account of its "]]]
