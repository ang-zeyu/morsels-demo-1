My sister, Miss Susan, has often  inveighed against this practice of mine, and it was only yesterday that  she informed me that I was the most exasperating man in the world.    However, as Miss Susan's experience with men during the sixty-seven hot  summers and sixty-eight hard winters of her life has been somewhat  limited, I think I should bear her criticism without a murmur.  Miss  Susan is really one of the kindest creatures in all the world.  It is  her misfortune that she has had all her life an insane passion for  collecting crockery, old pewter, old brass, old glass, old furniture  and other trumpery of that character; a passion with which I have  little sympathy.  I do not know that Miss Susan is prouder of her  collection of all this folderol than she is of the fact that she is a  spinster.    This latter peculiarity asserts itself upon  every occasion possible.  I recall an unpleasant scene in the omnibus last winter, when the  obsequious conductor, taking advantage of my sister's white hair and  furrowed cheeks, addressed that estimable lady as \"Madam.\"  I'd have  you know that my sister gave the fellow to understand very shortly and  in very vigorous English (emphasized with her blue silk umbrella) that  she was Miss Susan, and that she did not intend to be Madamed by  anybody, under any condition.        IV    THE MANIA OF COLLECTING SEIZES ME    Captivity Waite never approved of my fondness for fairy literature.  She shared the enthusiasm which I expressed whenever \"Robinson Crusoe\"  was mentioned; there was just enough seriousness in De Foe's romance,  just enough piety to appeal for sympathy to one of Captivity Waite's  religious turn of mind. When it came to fiction involving witches,  ogres, and flubdubs, that was too much for Captivity, and the spirit of  the little Puritan revolted.    Yet I have the documentary evidence to prove that Captivity's ancestors  (both paternal and maternal) were, in the palmy colonial times, as  abject slaves to superstition as could well be imagined.  The Waites of  Salem were famous persecutors of witches, and  Sinai Higginbotham  (Captivity's great-great-grandfather on her mother's side of the  family) was Cotton Mather's boon companion, and rode around the gallows  with that zealous theologian on that memorable occasion when five young  women were hanged at Danvers upon the charge of having tormented little  children with their damnable arts of witchcraft.  Human thought is like  a monstrous pendulum: it keeps swinging from one extreme to the other.  Within the compass of five generations we find the Puritan first an  uncompromising believer in demonology and magic, and then a scoffer at  everything involving the play of fancy.    I felt harshly toward Captivity Waite for a time, but I harbor her no  ill-will now; on the contrary, I recall with very tender feelings the  distant time when our sympathies were the same and when we journeyed  the pathway of early youth in a companionship sanctified by the  innocence and the loyalty and the truth of childhood.  Indeed, I am not  sure that that early friendship did not make a lasting impression upon  my life; I have thought of Captivity Waite a great  many times, and I  have not unfrequently wondered what might have been but for that book  of fairy tales which my Uncle Cephas sent me.    She was a very pretty child, and she lost none of her comeliness and  none of her sweetness of character as she approached maturity.  I was  impressed with this upon my return from college. She, too, had pursued  those studies deemed necessary to the acquirement of a good education;  she had taken a four years' course at South Holyoke and had finished at  Mrs. Willard's seminary at Troy.  \"You will now,\" said her father, and  he voiced the New England sentiment regarding young womanhood; \"you  will now return to the quiet of your home and under the direction of  your mother study the performance of those weightier duties which  qualify your sex for a realization of the solemn responsibilities of  human life.\"    Three or four years ago a fine-looking young fellow walked in upon me  with a letter of introduction from his mother.  He was Captivity  Waite's son!  Captivity is a widow now, and she is still living in her  native State, within twenty miles of the spot where she was born.  Colonel Parker, her husband, left her a good property when he died, and  she is famous for her charities. She has founded a village library, and  she has written me on several occasions for advice upon proposed  purchases of books.    I don't mind telling you that I had a good deal of malicious pleasure  in sending her not long ago a reminder of old times in these words:  \"My valued friend,\" I wrote, \"I see by the catalogue recently published  that your village library contains, among other volumes representing  the modern school of fiction, eleven copies of 'Trilby' and six copies  of 'The Heavenly Twins.' I also note an absence of certain works whose  influence upon my earlier life was such that I make bold to send copies  of the same to your care in the hope that you will kindly present them  to the library with my most cordial compliments.  These are a copy each  of the 'New England Primer' and Grimm's 'Household Stories.'\"    At the age of twenty-three, having been graduated from college and  having read the poems of Villon, the confessions of Rousseau, and  Boswell's life of Johnson, I was convinced that I had comprehended the  sum of human wisdom and knew all there was worth knowing.  If at the  present time--for I am seventy-two--I knew as much as I thought I knew  at twenty-three I should undoubtedly be a prodigy of learning and  wisdom.    I started out to be a philosopher.  My grandmother's death during my  second year at college possessed me of a considerable sum of money and  severed every tie and sentimental obligation which had previously held  me to my grandmother's wish that I become a minister of the gospel.  When I became convinced that I knew everything I conceived a desire to  see something, for I had traveled none and I had met but few people.    Upon the advice of my Uncle Cephas, I made a journey to Europe, and  devoted two years to seeing sights and to acquainting myself with the  people and the customs abroad.  Nine months of this time I spent in  Paris, which was then an irregular and unkempt city, but withal quite  as evil as at present.  I took apartments in the Latin  Quarter, and,  being of a generous nature, I devoted a large share of my income to the  support of certain artists and students whose talents and time were  expended almost exclusively in the pursuit of pleasure.    While thus serving as a visible means of support to this horde of  parasites, I fell in with the man who has since then been my intimate  friend.  Judge Methuen was a visitor in Paris, and we became boon  companions.  It was he who rescued me from the parasites and revived  the flames of honorable ambition, which had well-nigh been extinguished  by the wretched influence of Villon and Rousseau.  The Judge was a year  my senior, and a wealthy father provided him with the means for  gratifying his wholesome and refined tastes.  We two went together to  London, and it was during our sojourn in that capital that I began my  career as a collector of books.  It is simply justice to my benefactor  to say that to my dear friend Methuen I am indebted for the inspiration  which started me upon a course so full of sweet surprises and precious  rewards.    There are very many kinds of book collectors, but I think all may be  grouped in  three classes, viz.:  Those who collect from vanity; those  who collect for the benefits of learning; those who collect through a  veneration and love for books.  It is not unfrequent that men who begin  to collect books merely to gratify their personal vanity find  themselves presently so much in love with the pursuit that they become  collectors in the better sense.    Just as a man who takes pleasure in the conquest of feminine hearts  invariably finds himself at last ensnared by the very passion which he  has been using simply for the gratification of his vanity, I am  inclined to think that the element of vanity enters, to a degree, into  every phase of book collecting; vanity is, I take it, one of the  essentials to a well-balanced character--not a prodigious vanity, but a  prudent, well-governed one.  But for vanity there would be no  competition in the world; without competition there would be no  progress.    In these later days I often hear this man or that sneered at because,  forsooth, he collects books without knowing what the books are about.  But for my part, I say that that  man bids fair to be all right; he has  made a proper start in the right direction, and the likelihood is that,  other things being equal, he will eventually become a lover, as well as  a buyer, of books. Indeed, I care not what the beginning is, so long as  it be a beginning.  There are different ways of reaching the goal.  Some folk go horseback via the royal road, but very many others are  compelled to adopt the more tedious processes, involving rocky pathways  and torn shoon and sore feet.    So subtile and so infectious is this grand passion that one is hardly  aware of its presence before it has complete possession of him; and I  have known instances of men who, after having associated one evening  with Judge Methuen and me, have waked up the next morning filled with  the incurable enthusiasm of bibliomania.  But the development of the  passion is not always marked by exhibitions of violence; sometimes,  like the measles, it is slow and obstinate about \"comi"]]]
