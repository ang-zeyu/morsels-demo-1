But this alloy is always made artificially by mixing  pure silver with the due proportion of the copper; and for this  purpose the silver must be obtained pure by the refiner. This he  formerly effected by amalgamation, or by roasting it with lead; and  the cost of this process was about 2l. for every hundred-weight of  silver. In the silver so prepared, about 1/1200 to 1/2000th part of  gold remained; to effect the separation of this by nitrio-hydrochloric  acid was more expensive than the value of the gold; it was therefore  left in utensils, or circulated in coin, valueless. The copper, too,  of the native silver was no use whatever. But the 1/1000th part of  gold, being about one and a half per cent. of the value of the silver,  now covers the cost of refining, and affords an adequate profit to  the refiner; so that he effects the separation of the copper, and  returns to his employer the whole amount of the pure silver, as well  as the copper, without demanding any payment: he is amply remunerated  by that minute portion of gold. The new process of refining is a most  beautiful chemical operation: the granulated metal is boiled in  concentrated sulphuric acid, which dissolves both the silver and the  copper, leaving the gold nearly pure, in the form of a black powder.  The solution is then placed in a leaden vessel containing metallic  copper; this is gradually dissolved, and the silver precipitated in  a pure metallic state. The sulphate of copper thus formed is also a  valuable product, being employed in the manufacture of green and  blue pigments.    Other immediate results of the economical production of sulphuric  acid, are the general employment of phosphorus matches, and of  stearine candles, that beautiful substitute for tallow and wax.  Twenty-five years ago, the present prices and extensive applications  of sulphuric and muriatic acids, of soda, phosphorus, &c., would  have been considered utterly impossible. Who is able to foresee what  new and unthought-of chemical productions, ministering to the  service and comforts of mankind, the next twenty-five years may  produce?    After these remarks you will perceive that it is no exaggeration to  say, we may fairly judge of the commercial prosperity of a country  from the amount of sulphuric acid it consumes. Reflecting upon the  important influence which the price of sulphur exercises upon the  cost of production of bleached and printed cotton stuffs, soap,  glass, &c., and remembering that Great Britain supplies America,  Spain, Portugal, and the East, with these, exchanging them for raw  cotton, silk, wine, raisins, indigo, &c., &c., we can understand why  the English Government should have resolved to resort to war with  Naples, in order to abolish the sulphur monopoly, which the latter  power attempted recently to establish. Nothing could be more opposed  to the true interests of Sicily than such a monopoly; indeed, had it  been maintained a few years, it is highly probable that sulphur, the  source of her wealth, would have been rendered perfectly valueless  to her. Science and industry form a power to which it is dangerous  to present impediments. It was not difficult to perceive that the  issue would be the entire cessation of the exportation of sulphur  from Sicily. In the short period the sulphur monopoly lasted,  fifteen patents were taken out for methods to obtain back the  sulphuric acid used in making soda. Admitting that these fifteen  experiments were not perfectly successful, there can be no doubt it  would ere long have been accomplished. But then, in gypsum,  (sulphate of lime), and in heavy-spar, (sulphate of barytes), we  possess mountains of sulphuric acid; in galena, (sulphate of lead),  and in iron pyrites, we have no less abundance of sulphur. The  problem is, how to separate the sulphuric acid, or the sulphur, from  these native stores. Hundreds of thousands of pounds weight of  sulphuric acid were prepared from iron pyrites, while the high price  of sulphur consequent upon the monopoly lasted. We should probably  ere long have triumphed over all difficulties, and have separated it  from gypsum. The impulse has been given, the possibility of the  process proved, and it may happen in a few years that the  inconsiderate financial speculation of Naples may deprive her of  that lucrative commerce. In like manner Russia, by her prohibitory  system, has lost much of her trade in tallow and potash. One country  purchases only from absolute necessity from another, which excludes  her own productions from her markets. Instead of the tallow and  linseed oil of Russia, Great Britain now uses palm oil and cocoa-nut  oil of other countries. Precisely analogous is the combination of  workmen against their employers, which has led to the construction  of many admirable machines for superseding manual labour. In  commerce and industry every imprudence carries with it its own  punishment; every oppression immediately and sensibly recoils upon  the head of those from whom it emanates.          LETTER IV      My dear Sir,    One of the most influential causes of improvement in the social  condition of mankind is that spirit of enterprise which induces men  of capital to adopt and carry out suggestions for the improvement of  machinery, the creation of new articles of commerce, or the cheaper  production of those already in demand; and we cannot but admire the  energy with which such men devote their talents, their time, and  their wealth, to realise the benefits of the discoveries and  inventions of science. For even when these are expended upon objects  wholly incapable of realisation,--nay, even when the idea which  first gave the impulse proves in the end to be altogether  impracticable or absurd, immediate good to the community generally  ensues; some useful and perhaps unlooked-for result flows directly,  or springs ultimately, from exertions frustrated in their main  design. Thus it is also in the pursuit of science. Theories lead to  experiments and investigations; and he who investigates will  scarcely ever fail of being rewarded by discoveries. It may be,  indeed, the theory sought to be established is entirely unfounded in  nature; but while searching in a right spirit for one thing, the  inquirer may be rewarded by finding others far more valuable than  those which he sought.    At the present moment, electro-magnetism, as a moving power, is  engaging great attention and study; wonders are expected from its  application to this purpose. According to the sanguine expectations  of many persons, it will shortly be employed to put into motion  every kind of machinery, and amongst other things it will be applied  to impel the carriages of railroads, and this at so small a cost,  that expense will no longer be matter of consideration. England is  to lose her superiority as a manufacturing country, inasmuch as her  vast store of coals will no longer avail her as an economical source  of motive power. \"We,\" say the German cultivators of this science,  \"have cheap zinc, and, how small a quantity of this metal is  required to turn a lathe, and consequently to give motion to any  kind of machinery!\"    Such expectations may be very attractive, and yet they are  altogether illusory! they will not bear the test of a few simple  calculations; and these our friends have not troubled themselves to  institute.    With a simple flame of spirits of wine, under a proper vessel  containing boiling water, a small carriage of 200 to 300 pounds  weight can be put into motion, or a weight of 80 to 100 pounds may  be raised to a height of 20 feet. The same effects may be produced  by dissolving zinc in dilute sulphuric acid in a certain apparatus.  This is certainly an astonishing and highly interesting discovery;  but the question to be determined is, which of the two processes is  the least expensive?    In order to answer this question, and to judge correctly of the  hopes entertained from this discovery, let me remind you of what  chemists denominate \"equivalents.\" These are certain unalterable  ratios of effects which are proportionate to each other, and may  therefore be expressed in numbers. Thus, if we require 8 pounds of  oxygen to produce a certain effect, and we wish to employ chlorine  for the same effect, we must employ neither more nor less than 35  1/2 pounds weight. In the same manner, 6 pounds weight of coal are  equivalent to 32 pounds weight of zinc. The numbers representing  chemical equivalents express very general ratios of effects,  comprehending for all bodies all the actions they are capable of  producing.    If zinc be combined in a certain manner with another metal, and  submitted to the action of dilute sulphuric acid, it is dissolved in  the form of an oxide; it is in fact burned at the expense of the  oxygen contained in the fluid. A consequence of this action is the  production of an electric current, which, if conducted through a  wire, renders it magnetic. In thus effecting the solution of a pound  weight, for example, of zinc, we obtain a definite amount of force  adequate to raise a given weight one inch, and to keep it suspended;  and the amount of weight it will be capable of suspending will be  the greater the more rapidly the zinc is dissolved.    By alternately interrupting and renewing the contact of the zinc  with the acid, and by very simple mechanical arrangements, we can  give to the iron an upward and downward or a horizontal motion, thus  producing the conditions essential to the motion of any machinery.    This moving force is produced by the oxidation of the zinc; and,  setting aside the name given to the force in this case, we know that  it can be produced in another manner. If we burn the zinc under the  boiler of a steam-engine, consequently in the oxygen of the air  instead of the galvanic pile, we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#5)"],[1,"hurch, both in England and Canada, he  was very successful, and made many converts. \"My object,\" he remarks,  \"was to teach them what I then considered the leading doctrines of the  Christian religion, rather than the peculiar dogmas of Methodism.\" His  theological investigations had made him very much dissatisfied with  existing creeds and churches, because of the wide difference between  modern and primitive Christianity, in doctrine, in ordinances, in  organization and above all, in spirit and power.    He was not the only one on whom the Spirit was operating in this  manner. There were several others, chiefly men belonging to the same  Church, in or near Toronto, and engaged in the same calling. They were  gentlemen of refinement and education, and generally talented.    It was their custom to meet several times a week to search the  scriptures, and investigate the doctrines of the Christian religion as  contained in the Bible. They were all familiar with the various systems  of theology as accepted by the Christian sects of the day, and as they  had more or less distrust regarding each of them they agreed, in their  investigation, to reject every man's opinion and work, and to search  the scriptures alone, praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit.    On these lines they investigated the claims of each sect of religion,  as to its being the Church of Christ. The result of that investigation  was that they were driven irresistibly to the conclusion that all  sects were in error, and without authority to preach the gospel or  administer its ordinances. \"If modern Christianity is true,\" said they,  \"then the Bible is false,\" and _vice versa_. Fortunately they clung to  a firm belief in the Bible; and further believed in a restoration of  pure principles and a true church. They believed that men should be  called of God as in former days, and ordained by proper authority; and  that in the Church there should be apostles and prophets, evangelists  and pastors, teachers and deacons; in short, that the primitive  organization of the Church of Christ should be perpetuated.    They believed that men who accepted the gospel should have bestowed  upon them the Holy Ghost; that it should lead them into all truth,  and show them things to come. They believed also in the gift of  tongues, the gift of healing, miracles, prophecy, faith, discerning of  spirits and all the powers, graces and blessings as experienced in the  Christian Church of former days. They believed that Israel would be  gathered, the ten tribes restored; that judgments would overtake the  wicked, and Christ return to the earth and reign with the righteous;  they believed in the first and second resurrection, and in the final  glory and triumph of the righteous. But while they believed all these  things, they recognized the fact that they had no authority to act in  the premises and organize a church, incorporating these views in its  doctrines and organization. True, they might organize a church with  apostles and prophets, and all other officers, and teach the letter of  their principles; but whence should they look for the Spirit to give it  life, and make their dream of a restored, perfect Christian church a  reality? It was evident to them they could not perform this work unless  called of God to do it, and they were painfully conscious of the fact  that not one among them was so called. They could only wait, and pray  that God would send to them a messenger if He had a Church on the earth.    So wide and thorough an investigation of religion, by such a body  of men, could not fail to attract some attention, especially from  the church with which the most of them were nominally connected. The  leading men in the Methodist church called a special conference to  consider the principles of these heterodox brethren. The meeting was  called and presided over by some of the most prominent leaders in the  Methodist persuasion in Canada, among whom were the Rev. Mr. Ryarson  and Rev. Mr. Lord, of the British conference. The hearing was not a  trial _pro forma_, but rather a friendly discussion of those principles  held by the brethren in question.    The hearing continued through several days; and in the debates the  \"heterodox\" held their own against the learning and talent of the  church leaders; and at the conclusion of the investigation expressed  themselves as being more fully confirmed in their doctrines since  their learned opponents had been unable to refute them by the word of  God. The conclusion reached by the conference was thus stated by the  president:    \"Brethren, we esteem you as brethren and gentlemen; we believe you are  sincere, but cannot fellowship your doctrine. Wishing, however, to  concede all we can, we would say: You may believe your doctrines if  you will not teach them; and we will still retain you in fellowship as  members, leaders and preachers.\"    These conditions the \"heterodox\" could not conscientiously comply with,  so they were deprived of their offices but retained as members. Since  they considered the Methodist Church without authority, taking from  them their offices was not regarded by them as a hardship.    Meantime, their fastings and prayers, their longing for the Kingdom of  God, came up in remembrance before the Lord, and He sent a messenger  to them. Parley P. Pratt, an Apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ,  called upon Mr. Taylor, with a letter of introduction from a merchant  acquaintance of his, Mr. Moses Nickerson. As soon as he learned that  Mr. Pratt was a \"Mormon,\" he thought his acquaintance had imposed upon  him a little by sending him such a character; for then, as now, and  as in the days of the ancient apostles, the Saints were everywhere  spoken against, and Mr. Taylor had heard the evil rumors circulated  about them; and because of these rumors, he had been led to regard  \"Mormonism\" as anything but a _religious_ system. He treated Apostle  Pratt courteously, as he considered himself bound to do, because of  his letter of introduction; but the reception he gave him could not be  called cordial.    It was a strange message the Apostle had to deliver--this story  of the revelation of the gospel: how God had passed by the great,  and learned, and eloquent theologians of the day, and had revealed  Himself to an unlearned youth, reared in the backwoods of New York;  how, subsequently, He sent to him an angel, who made known to him  the existence of the hidden record of the ancient inhabitants of  America--the Book of Mormon; how that angel met him annually in the  month of September for four successive years, and taught him the gospel  and many things concerning the work of the Lord in these last days; and  then delivered into his keeping those records, which he translated into  the English language by the gift and power of God; how this same young  man, during the progress of the work of translation, was visited by  John the Baptist, who conferred upon him and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic  Priesthood, which gave them the authority to preach repentance and  baptize for remission of sins; how, subsequently, the ancient apostles,  Peter, James and John came and conferred upon the young Prophet the  apostleship, which gave him the right and power to ordain other men  to be Apostles, Seventies, High Priests and Elders; to lay on hands  for the gift of the Holy Ghost--in short, which gave him the right to  preach the gospel in all the world, and establish the Church of Christ  on the earth.    But if this story was strange, the circumstance which led to the  Apostle coming among them, though of less importance than the main  message he had to deliver, was stranger still. He told them how Heber  C. Kimball, and others, came to his house one night, in Kirtland, after  he and Mrs. Pratt had retired. Heber C. Kimball requested him to get up  as he had a prophecy to deliver concerning him. Apostle Pratt arose and  his visitor thus addressed him:    \"Brother Parley, thy wife shall be healed from this hour, and shall  bear a son, and his name shall be Parley; and he shall be a chosen  instrument in the hands of the Lord to inherit the priesthood, and to  walk in the footsteps of his father. He shall do a great work on the  earth in ministering the word and teaching the children of men. Arise,  therefore, and go forth in the ministry, nothing doubting. Take no  thought for your debts, nor the necessaries of life, for the Lord will  supply you with abundant means for all things. Thou shalt go to Upper  Canada, even to the city of Toronto, the capital, and there thou shalt  find a people prepared for the gospel, and they shall receive thee, and  thou shalt organize the Church among them, and it shall spread thence  into the regions round about, and many shall be brought to a knowledge  of the truth, and shall be filled with joy; and from the things growing  out of this mission, shall the fullness of the gospel spread into  England, and cause a great work to be done in that land.\"    To understand the boldness of this prediction the reader ought to be  informed that Apostle Pratt had been married to his wife ten years, but  they had never been blessed with offspring; and for six years his wife  had been considered an incurable consumptive.    As before stated Mr Taylor did not receive Apostle Pratt very  cordially. While seeking for the truth he did not propose being led  away by every wind of doctrine, nor by the cunning craftiness of men  who lie in wait to deceive. He was very cautious, remembering that an  ancient apostle had said:    \"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, [the gospel]  receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed; for he that  biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.\" [1]    He therefore rendered Elder Pratt no assistance, until he began to  discover that there were good grounds for believing he was a messenger  sent of God.
