The Islanders have thus a moral claim upon the American       nation for protection. In no way can this be more       efficiently bestowed than by receiving them into the family       of this great republic. The native population are as well       prepared to be American citizens as the multitude of       European emigrants. Unlike the generality of them, they can       read and write, and have already acquired democratic ideas       under the operation of their own liberal constitution of       government, which will readily enable them to incorporate       themselves under our institutions. They are destined to be       supplanted in numbers and power by a foreign race. They       desire us to be their successors and protectors. The present       revenues of the Islands are more than adequate to the       expenses of their government--time, opportunity, the       interests of the inhabitants and ourselves point to this       result.' Events will soon determine whether they are to       retain their independency, or to be merged in the nation       that has civilized them.\"    The work abounds in interesting details of Island Life, and we regret that  our limits will not permit us to enrich the _International_ with more  liberal extracts. We can at present add but the following paragraphs on a  sport for which the islanders have been celebrated ever since the days of  Cook:         \"It is highly amusing to a stranger to go out into the south       part of this town, some day when the sea is rolling in       heavily over the reef, and to observe there the evolutions       and rapid career of a company of surf-players. The sport is       so attractive and full of wild excitement to Hawaiians, and       withal so healthful, that I cannot but hope it will be many       years before civilization shall look it out of countenance,       or make it disreputable to indulge in this manly though       dangerous exercise. Many a man from abroad who has witnessed       this exhilarating play, has no doubt only wished that he was       free and able to share in it himself. For my part, I should       like nothing better, if I could do it, than to get balanced       on a board just before a great rushing wave, and so be       hurried in half or a quarter of a mile landward with the       speed of a race-horse, all the time enveloped in foam and       spray, but without letting the roller break and tumble over       my head.         \"In this consists the strength of muscle and sleight of       hand, to keep the head and shoulders just ahead and clear of       the great crested wall that is every moment impending over       one, and threatening to bury the bold surf-rider in its       watery ruin. The natives do this with admirable intrepidity       and skill, riding in, as it were, upon the neck and mane of       their furious charger; and when you look to see them, their       swift race run, dashed upon the rocks or sand, behold, they       have slipped under the belly of the wave they rode, and are       away outside, waiting for a cruise upon another. Both men       and women, girls and boys, have their times for this       diversion. Even the huge Premier (Auhea) has been known to       commit her bulky person to a surf-board; and the chiefs       generally, when they visit Lahaina, take a turn or two at       this invigorating sport with billows and board. For a more       accurate idea of it than can be conveyed by any description,       the reader is referred to the engraving.         \"I have no doubt it would run away with dyspepsia from many       a bather at Rockaway or Easthampton, if they would learn,       and dare to use a surf-board on those great Atlantic       rollers, as the Hawaiians do on the waves of the Pacific.       But there is wanting on the Atlantic sea-board that       delicious, bland temperature of the water, which within the       tropics, while it makes sea-bathing equally a tonic, renders       it always safe.         \"The missionaries at these islands, and foreigners       generally, are greatly at fault in that they do not avail       themselves more of this easy and unequalled means of       retaining health, or of restoring it when enfeebled. Bathing       in fresh water, in a close bath-house, is not to be compared       to it as an invigorating and remedial agent; and it is       unwise, not to say criminal, in such a climate, to neglect       so natural a way of preserving health, as washing and       swimming in the sea. In those who live close to the water,       and on the leeward side of the Islands, it is the more       inexcusable, for it could be enjoyed without exposure in the       dewless evenings; or in some places a small house might be       built on stone abutments over the water, and facilities so       contrived that both sexes could enjoy this great luxury of a       life within the tropics.\"    The volume has several spirited engravings, and is excellently printed.

PHILIP PENDLETON COOKE.    [Illustration]      Among our pleasantest friends in many years was the author of the  _Froissart Ballads_. We think of him as a friend, but we never saw him; his  features are familiar to us only by this poor counterfeit, and all we know  of his voice is that it has been described to us as musically joyous,  sometimes varying to a sad sweetness, sometimes wild. For half a dozen  years visits to him were written of, and hoped for, and it was settled, we  thought, that we were to share with him a turkey-hunt in the Old Dominion,  in a few weeks, when suddenly the intelligence came that he was dead.    Philip Pendleton Cooke was born in Martinsburg, Berkeley county, Virginia,  on the twenty-sixth of October, 1816. His father, Mr. John R. Cooke, was  then and is now honorably distinguished at the bar, and his mother was of  that family of Pendletons which has furnished so many eminent names to that  part of the Union.    At fifteen he entered Princeton college, where he had a reputation for  parts, though he did not distinguish himself, or take an honor, and could  never tell how it happened that he obtained a degree, as he was not  examined with his class. He liked fishing and hunting better than the  books, and Chaucer and Spenser much more than the dull volumes in the  \"course of study.\" He had already made rhymes before he became a freshman,  and the appearance of the early numbers of the _Knickerbocker Magazine_  prompted him to new efforts in this way; he wrote for the _Knickerbocker_,  in his seventeenth year, _The Song of the Sioux Lover_, and _The  Consumptive_, and in a village paper, about the same time, humorous and  sentimental verses.    When he left college his father was living at Winchester, and there he  himself pursued the study of the law. He wrote pieces in verse and prose  for the _Virginian_, and _The Southern Literary Messenger_ (then just  started), and projected novels and an extensive work in literary criticism.  Before he was twenty-one he was married, admitted to the bar, and had a  fair prospect of practice, in Frederick, Jefferson, and Berkeley counties.  \"I am blessed by my fireside,\" he wrote, \"here on the banks of the  Shenandoah in view and within a mile of the Blue Ridge; I go to county  towns, at the sessions of the courts, and hunt, and fish, and make myself  as happy with my companions as I can.\"    \"So,\" he wrote to us in 1846, \"have passed five, six, seven, eight years,  and now I am striving, after long disease of my literary veins, to get the  rubbish of idle habits away and work them again. My fruit-trees,  rose-bushes, poultry, guns, fishing-tackle, good, hard-riding friends, a  long-necked bottle on my sideboard, an occasional client, &c., &c., &c.,  make it a little difficult to get from the real into the clouds again. It  requires a resolute habit of self-concentration to enable a man to shut out  these and all such real concerns, and give himself warmly to the nobler or  more tender sort of writing--and I am slowly acquiring it.\"    The atmosphere in which he lived was not, it seems, altogether  congenial--so far as literature was concerned--and he wrote:         \"What do you think of a good friend of mine, a most valuable       and worthy and hard-riding one, saying gravely to me a short       time ago, 'I would'nt waste time on a damned thing like       poetry; you might make yourself, with all your sense and       judgment, a useful man in settling neighborhood disputes and       difficulties.' You have as much chance with such people, as       a dolphin would have if in one of his darts he pitched in       amongst the machinery of a mill. \"Philosophy would clip an       angel's wings,\" Keats says, and pompous dulness would do the       same. But these very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3657"],[0,"Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America — (#5)"],[1,"deed,' he replied, 'but dil mazbut karke      lagaya: I nerved myself for the occasion.' 'A good man and      true!' a high officer writes, 'who after firing never moved      an inch till Mr. Fraser came to him, although close to the      tiger all the while. He is one of the Gawilghur Rajputs--a      brave race, Ranjit Singh, a good name.' The man said he had      no more cartridges left and so they both got a little      farther from the tiger, as the orderly was evidently done      for. Afterwards they found one more cartridge for the gun      and tried to recover the body, but it was no use. The tiger      was lying close, most of the buffaloes had bolted and the      Kurkoos would not help. Mr. Fraser then sent six miles off      for an elephant. But the animal did not arrive till dark, so      Mr. Fraser went home in great grief about the poor orderly      and at having to leave the body. His own wound was bleeding      a great deal, it being a deep claw gash. Next day they got      the body and the tiger dead, lying close to each other.      Perhaps no narrower escape than Mr. Fraser's has ever been      heard of. To the excellent shot which knocked the beast's      eye out he undoubtedly owes his life. He says that he felt      that he had the tiger dead when he fired, but the Express      bullet unfortunately broke up. Probably, he thinks a 12-bore      would have reached the brain.\"    I could produce numerous instances where failures have occurred, and I  know sportsmen of long experience who have given up the use of hollow  bullets except against such small game as black-buck and other antelopes  or deer.    So much for the Express hollow bullet, after which it is at the option  of all persons to please themselves; but personally I should decline the  company of any friend who wished to join me in the pursuit of dangerous  game if armed with such an inferior weapon. In another portion of this  volume I shall produce a striking instance of the result.    The magazine rifle, which is destined to become the military arm of the  future, can hardly merit a place among sporting rifles, as it must  always possess the disadvantage of altering its balance as the  ammunition is expended. The Winchester Company have, I believe, produced  a great improvement in a rifle of this kind, '400, which carries a  charge of 110 grains of powder; but even so small a bore must be unhandy  if the rifle is arranged to contain a supply of cartridges. For my own  use I am quite contented with one '577, a '400, and a No. 12 Paradox -  all solid bullets, but varying in hardness of metal according to the  quality of game; for the largest animals a pair of No. 8 rifles with  hard bullets and 14 drams of powder.    I can say nothing more concerning rifles for the practical use of  sportsmen, although a volume might be devoted to their history and  development. Shot guns are too well understood to merit a special  notice.        CHAPTER II    THE ELEPHANT (ELEPHAS)    This animal has interested mankind more than any other, owing to the  peculiar combination of immense proportions with extraordinary sagacity.  The question has frequently been raised \"Whether the elephant or the dog  should be accepted as superior in intelligence?\" My own experience would  decide without hesitation--The Dog is man's companion; the Elephant is  his slave.    We all know the attachment and fidelity of the dog, who appears to have  been created specially to become the friend of the human race. He  attaches himself equally to the poor man and the rich, and shares our  fortunes \"for better, for worse,\" clinging with heroic loyalty to his  master when all other friends may have abandoned him. The power of  memory is wonderfully exhibited, considering the shortness of life which  Nature, by some mischance has accorded to man's best friend.    \"While thus Florinda spake, the dog who lay Before Rusilla's feet,  eyeing him long And wistfully, had recognised at length, Changed as he  was and in those sordid weeds, His royal master. And he rose and lick'd  His withered hand, and earnestly looked up With eyes whose human meaning  did not need The aid of speech; and moan'd, as if at once To court and  chide the long-withheld caress... . . . . . . . Disputing, he withdrew.  The watchful dog Followed his footsteps close. But he retired Into the  thickest grove; there yielding way To his o'erburthen'd nature, from all  eyes Apart, he cast himself upon the ground, And threw his arms around  the dog, and cried While tears stream'd down. Thou Theron, thou hast  known Thy poor lost master... Theron, only thou!\"--    Southey's \"Roderick, last of the Goths.\"    In case of danger the dog will defend his master, guided by his own  unaided intelligence; he at once detects and attacks the enemy. In wild  sports he *shares the delight of hunting equally with his master, and  the two are inseparable allies. The day is over, and he lies down and  sleeps before the fire at his master's feet, and dreams of the dangers  and exploits; he is a member of his master's household.    The elephant is, in my opinion, overrated.  He can be educated to  perform certain acts, but he would never volunteer his services. There  is no elephant that I ever saw who would spontaneously interfere to save  his master from drowning or from attack. An enemy might assassinate you  at the feet of your favourite elephant, but he would never attempt to  interfere in your defence; he would probably run away, or remain  impassive, unless guided and instructed by his mahout. This is  incontestable; the elephant will do nothing useful unless he is  specially ordered to perform a certain work or movement.    While condemning this apathetic character, we must admit that in the  elephant the power of learning is extraordinary, and that it can be  educated to perform wonders; but such performances are only wonderful as  proving the necessary force of direction and guidance by a superior  power, to which the animal is amenable.    I have had very many years' experience with elephants, both Asiatic and  African, and in my opinion they are naturally timid. Although in a wild  state the males are more or less dangerous, especially in Africa, the  herd of elephants will generally retreat should they even wind an unseen  enemy. This timidity is increased by domestication, and it is difficult  to obtain an elephant sufficiently staunch to withstand the attack of  any wild animal. They will generally turn tail, and not only retreat  gracefully, but will run in a disgraceful panic, to the great danger of  their riders should the locality be forest.    The difference in species is distinct between the Asiatic and the  African. It is at all times difficult to give the measurement of a dead  animal, especially when so enormous, as the pressure of weight when  alive would reduce the height afforded by measurement when the body is  horizontal.    The well-known African elephant Jumbo that was sold to America by the  Zoological Society of London, was brought up in confinement since its  early existence, when it was about 4 feet 6 inches high. That elephant  was carefully weighed and measured before it left England, with the  result, of height at shoulder, 11 feet; weight, six tons and a half. The  girth of the fore-foot when the pressure of the animal's weight was  exerted, was exactly half the perpendicular height of the elephant. I  have seen very much larger animals in Africa, but there is nothing in  India to approach the size of Jumbo.    There is no reason why the African elephants should not be tamed and  made useful, but the difficulty lies in obtaining them in any great  numbers. The natives of Africa are peculiarly savage, and their  instincts of destruction prevent them from capturing and domesticating  any wild animals. During nine years' experience of Central Africa I  never saw a tamed creature of any kind, not even a bird, or a young  antelope in possession of a child. The tame elephant would be especially  valuable to an explorer, as it could march through streams too deep for  the passage of oxen, and in swimming rivers it would be proof against  the attacks of crocodiles. So few African elephants have been tamed in  proportion to those of Asia that it would be difficult to pronounce an  opinion upon their character when domesticated, but it is generally  believed by their trainers that the Indian species is more gentle and  amenable to discipline. The power of the African is far in excess of the  Asiatic. Nine feet at the highest portion of the back is a good height  for an Indian male, and eight feet for the female, although occasionally  they are considerably larger. There are hardly any elephants that  measure ten feet in a direct perpendicular, although the mahouts pretend  to fictitious heights by measuring with a tape or cord from the spine,  including the curve of the body.    As Jumbo was proved to have attained the height of eleven feet although  in captivity from infancy, it may be easily imagined that in a wild  state the African elephant will attain twelve feet, or even more. I have  myself seen many animals that would have exceeded this, although it  would be impossible to estimate their height with accuracy.    The shape of the African variety is very peculiar, and differs in a  remarkable manner from the Asiatic. The highest point is the shoulder,  and the back is hollow; in the Indian the back is convex, and the  shoulder is considerably lower. The head of the African is quite unlike  that of the Indian; and the ears, which in the former are enormous,  completely cover the shoulder when thrown back. The best direction for a  vital shot at an African elephant is at the extremity of the ear when  flapped against the side. A bullet thus placed will pass through the  centre of the lungs. The Indian elephant has many more laminae in the  teeth than the African, constituting a larger grinding surface,"]]]
