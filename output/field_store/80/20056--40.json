It is natural of course that  relatives and friends should like to see the last of each other, but I  think it is a cruel kindness, and am glad, as you say, that we had no  dear friends in London. Those at home have already shown their  thoughtfulness and friendship.\" For indeed during the last few days  hampers of presents of all kinds had arrived in a steady flow at  Eastbourne Terrace. There had been great feeling of commiseration among  all their acquaintances at the misfortune that had befallen the  Renshaws; and the manner in which they had at once surrendered  everything for the benefit of the shareholders of the bank, and the  calmness with which they had borne their reverses, had excited  admiration, and scarce a friend or acquaintance but sent substantial  tokens of their good-will or sympathy.    As soon as it was publicly known that the Renshaws were about to sail  for New Zealand, the boys and masters of the grammar-school between them  subscribed and sent a handsome double-barrelled gun, a fishing-rod, and  all appurtenances, to Wilfrid. Mr. Renshaw received two guns, several  fishing-rods, two crates of crockery, and several cases of portable  furniture of various kinds, besides many small articles. Mrs. Renshaw  was presented with a stove of the best construction and a crate full of  utensils of every kind, while Marion had work-boxes and desks sufficient  to stock a school, two sets of garden tools, and innumerable nick-nacks  likely to be more or less useful to her in her new life. Besides these  there were several boxes of books of standard literature.    \"Every one is very kind,\" Mrs. Renshaw said as the crates and hampers  arrived; \"but if it goes on like this we shall have to charter a ship to  ourselves, and how we are to move about there when we get out with all  these things I have not the least idea.\"    At last the good-byes were all finished, the visitors had left the ship,  the hawsers were thrown off, and the vessel began to move slowly towards  the dock gates. As soon as she had issued through these she was seized  by a tug, and proceeded in tow down the crowded river. There was a last  waving of handkerchiefs and hats to the group of people standing at the  entrance to the docks, and then the passengers began to look round and  examine each other and the ship. Sailors were hard at work--the last  bales and boxes were being lowered into the hold, ropes were being  coiled up, and tidiness restored to the deck. Parties of seamen were  aloft loosening some of the sails, for the wind was favourable, and the  captain had ordered some of the canvas to be set to assist the tug.    \"Now, Marion,\" Mrs. Renshaw said, \"we had better go below and tidy up  things a bit. Wil, you may as well come down and help me get the trunks  stowed away under the berths, and put some hooks in for the brush-bags  and other things we have brought; the hooks and gimlet are in my  hand-bag.\"    Wilfrid assisted to set his mother's cabin in order, and then went to  his own. It was a good-sized cabin, and when the ship was full  accommodated four passengers; but the two upper bunks had now been taken  down, and there was, Wilfrid thought, ample room for two. On his own  bunk were piled his two portmanteaus, a gun-case, a bundle of  fishing-rods, and other odds and ends, and a somewhat similar collection  of luggage was on that opposite. Wilfred read the name on the labels.  \"Atherton,\" he said; \"I wonder what he is like. I do hope he will be a  nice fellow.\"    Scarcely had the thought passed through his mind when a figure appeared  at the cabin door. It was that of a tall stout man, with immensely broad  shoulders. His age Wilfrid guessed to be about thirty-five. He had a  pleasant face, and there was a humorous twinkle in his eye as the lad  looked round in astonishment at the figure completely blocking up the  doorway.    \"So you are Renshaw?\" the big man said. \"I congratulate myself and you  that your dimensions are not of the largest. My name is Atherton, as I  daresay you have seen on my luggage. Suppose we shake hands, Renshaw? It  is just as well to make friends at once, as we have got to put up with  each other for the next five or six months. Of course you are a little  appalled at my size,\" he went on, as he shook hands with the lad. \"Most  people are at first, but nobody is so much appalled as I am myself.  Still it has its amusing side, you know. I don't often get into an  omnibus, because I do not think it is fair; but if I am driven to do so,  and there happen to be five people on each side, the expression of alarm  on those ten faces when I appear at the door is a picture, because it is  manifestly impossible that they can make room for me on either side.\"    \"What do you do, sir?\" Wilfrid asked laughing.    \"I ask one of them to change sides. That leaves two places vacant, and  as I make a point of paying for two, we get on comfortably enough. It is  fortunate there are only two of us in this cabin. If I have the bad luck  to travel in a full ship I always wait until the others are in bed  before I turn in, and get up in the morning before they are astir; but I  think you and I can manage pretty comfortably.\"    \"Then you have travelled a good deal, sir?\" Wilfrid said.    \"I am always travelling,\" the other replied. \"I am like the fidgetty  Phil of the story-book, who could never keep still. Most men of my size  are content to take life quietly, but that is not so with me. For the  last twelve or thirteen years I have been always on the move, and I  ought to be worn down to a thread paper; but unfortunately, as you see,  that is not the effect of travel in my case. I suppose you are going out  to settle?\"    \"Yes, sir. I have my father, mother, and sister on board.\"    \"Lucky fellow!\" Mr. Atherton said; \"I have no relations worth speaking  of.\"    \"Are you going to settle at last, sir?\" Wilfrid asked.    \"No, I am going out to botanize. I have a mania for botany, and New  Zealand, you know, is in that respect one of the most remarkable regions  in the world, and it has not yet been explored with anything approaching  accuracy. It is a grand field for discovery, and there are special  points of interest connected with it, as it forms a sort of connecting  link between the floras of Australia, Asia, and South America, and has a  flora of its own entirely distinct from any of these. Now let me advise  you as to the stowing away of your traps. There is a good deal of knack  in these things. Have you got your portmanteaus packed so that one  contains all the things you are likely to require for say the first  month of your voyage, and the other as a reserve to be drawn on  occasionally? because, if not, I should advise you to take all the  things out and to arrange them in that way. It will take you a little  time, perhaps, but will save an immense amount of trouble throughout the  voyage.\"    Wilfrid had packed his trunks with things as they came to hand, but he  saw the advantage of following his fellow-passenger's advice, and  accordingly opened his portmanteaus and piled the whole of their  contents upon his berth. He then repacked them, Mr. Atherton sitting  down on his berth and giving his advice as to the trunk in which each  article should be placed.    The work of rearrangement occupied half-an-hour, and Wilfrid often  congratulated himself during the voyage upon the time so spent. When all  was complete and the cabin arranged tidily, Wilfrid looked in at the  next cabin. This was occupied by two young men of the name of Allen.  They were friends of an acquaintance of Mr. Renshaw, who, hearing that  they were journeying by the same ship to New Zealand, had brought them  down to Eastbourne Terrace and introduced them to Mr. Renshaw and his  family. The two were occupied in arranging their things in the cabin.    \"Well, Renshaw,\" James, the elder of them, said when he entered, \"I am  afraid I cannot congratulate you on your fellow-passenger. We saw him go  into your cabin. He is a tremendous man. He would be magnificent if he  were not so stout. Why, you will scarce find room to move!\"    \"He is a capital fellow,\" Wilfrid said. \"I think we shall get on  splendidly together. He is full of fun, and makes all sorts of jokes  about his own size. He has travelled a tremendous lot, and is up to  everything. He is nothing like so old as you would think, if you have  not seen his face. I do not think he is above thirty-five or so. Well,  as I see you have just finished, I will go up and see how we are getting  on.\"    When Wilfrid reached the deck he found the vessel was off Erith, and was  greeted by his sister.    \"You silly boy, you have been missing the sight of all the shipping, and  of Greenwich Hospital. The idea of stopping below all this time. I  should have come to call you up if I had known which was your room.\"    \"Cabin, you goose!\" Wilfrid said; \"the idea of talking of rooms on board  a ship. I would have come up if I had thought of it; but I was so busy  putting things to right and making the acquaintance of the gentleman in  the cabin with me that I forgot altogether we were moving down the  river.\"    \"Which is he, Wilfrid?\"    Wilfrid laughed and nodded in the direction of Mr. Atherton, who was  standing with his back towards them a short distance away.    Marion's eyes opened wide.    \"Oh, Wil, what a big man! He must quite fill up the cabin.\"    \"He seems an awfully good fellow, Marion.\"    \"I daresay he may be, Wil; but he will certainly take up more than his  share of the cabin.\"    \"It is awkward, isn't it, young lady?\" Mr. Atherton said, suddenly  turning round on his heel, to Marion's horror, while Wilfrid flushed  scarlet, for he had not the least idea that his words could be heard. \"I  have capital hearing, you see,\" Mr. Atherton went on with a laugh, \"and  a very useful sense it is sometimes, and has stood me in good service  upon many occasions, though I own "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33659"],[0,"Mammals of Northwestern South Dakota (#5)"],[1," those of two taken on August 4 and 5  measured 10 and 12, respectively. Young animals in juvenal pelage were  captured in each month, May through August, the earliest being taken on  May 20. The first female young of the year that was found carrying  embryos was trapped on June 16.    Molt from winter to summer pelage is evident on some specimens taken as  early as the latter part of May, but most individuals from that period  and from the first part of June still retained winter pelage. By the  last half of June, some mice had completed (or nearly so) the seasonal  molt, but many retained at least some worn pelage of winter into the  first week of July.    Two distinctive maturational pelages are seen in our material--juvenal  and post-juvenal or subadult, which generally resembles adult pelage (of  season) in texture but is duller of color. Collins (1918) for _P.  maniculatus_, Hoffmeister (1951) for _P. truei_, and Brown (1963) for  _P. boylii_, among others, have described maturational pelages and  sequence of maturational molts similar to those observed in our  specimens.    Deer mice from Harding County clearly are referable to _P. m.  nebrascensis_ (rather than to the smaller and paler _P. m. luteus_,  which occurs to the east and southeast), even though adults average  somewhat paler than adults of typical populations of that subspecies. A  tick of the _Ixodes ochotonae-angustus_ complex was obtained from one  specimen.      ~Onychomys leucogaster missouriensis~ (Audubon and Bachman, 1851)    Northern Grasshopper Mouse    _Specimens examined_ (4).--NE 1/4 sec. 22, R. 1 E, T. 22 N, 2; 2 mi. N,  5 mi. W Ludlow, 1; 14 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 1.    We found the grasshopper mouse uncommon in Harding County. All four of  the mice listed as examined were trapped in areas supporting sage and  short grasses, with relatively little ground cover.    Three of our four specimens are immature--two males collected on May 31  (testes 10, 12) and a female taken on June 25. An adult male trapped on  June 18 was in winter pelage, but molt was underway on the crown,  between the ears, and over the upper back and shoulders.      ~Neotoma cinerea rupicola~ J. A. Allen, 1894    Bushy-tailed Wood Rat    _Specimens examined_ (8).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 5; 12 mi. N Buffalo,  1 (USNM); 7 mi. N, 2-1/2 mi. W Camp Crook, 3300 ft., 1; 2 mi. S, 5 mi. E  Harding, 1.    This woodrat is relatively uncommon, yet widely distributed, in  northwestern South Dakota. The species probably occurs throughout the  rocky areas in the hills and buttes of Harding County, and also  frequents abandoned or little-used buildings and feed stations for  livestock. All of our specimens were trapped in rocky habitats, but in  many such places we trapped unsuccessfully for _Neotoma cinerea_, even  though some sign of its presence frequently was evident. Five of our  seven specimens (all taken late in June or early in July) are young of  the year in grayish pelage. An adult male trapped on July 14 had testes  that measured 14.    Over and Churchill (1945:40) mentioned a specimen, which they referred  to the subspecies _N. c. cinerea_, that \"probably came from the Slim  Butte area of Harding County.\" Visher (1914:89) recorded the species as  \"plentiful and general\" in the county.      ~Microtus ochrogaster haydenii~ (Baird, 1858)    Prairie Vole    _Specimens examined_ (40).--NE 1/4 sec. 22, R. 1 E, T. 23 N, 1; NW 1/4  sec. 15, R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 1; 2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 4; 4 mi. S, 7 mi.  W Ladner, 19; 1/2 mi. W Reva, 2; SW 1/4 sec. 30, R. 7 E, T. 18 N, 3; 10  mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 10.    The prairie vole is the most abundant of the three microtines that are  known from Harding County. Our specimens came primarily from areas of  relatively dense grasses, such as those found in stream bottoms and  along fencerows. At two places, along a fencerow 1/2 mi. W Reva and in  Deer Draw, 10 mi. S and 5 mi. W Reva, _Microtus ochrogaster_ and the  meadow vole, _M. pennsylvanicus_, were trapped together.    Nine females taken late in May and in June carried an average of 4.4  (3-6) embryos that averaged 14.8 (4-25) in crown-rump length. Each of  two lactating females taken in late May had six placental scars. Testes  of seven adult males taken in May and June averaged 13.1 (12-16) in  length.      ~Microtus pennsylvanicus insperatus~ (J. A. Allen, 1894)    Meadow Vole    _Specimens examined_ (14).--1/2 mi. W Reva, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva,  12; 7 mi. S, 4-1/2 mi. E Harding, 1.    This vole evidently is limited in Harding County to habitats of dense  grass and forbs adjacent to water. We failed to trap the species in some  areas that appeared to be suitable for occupancy.    Two females, collected on May 15 and June 2, contained three and six  embryos, respectively, that measured 15. One female with five placental  scars (May 15) and two with six (May 16, June 2) also were trapped, and  a lactating female was captured on June 20. Testes of two adult males  taken in spring (May 18 and June 2) measured 15, and those of one  weighing 45.6 grams that was taken early in June measured 17.      ~Ondatra zibethicus cinnamominus~ (Hollister, 1910)    Muskrat    The muskrat is common in Harding County. Half a century ago Visher  (1914:89) noted that it was \"Fairly plentiful along the streams having  deep permanent 'holes'.\"    Seven adults, all in winter pelage, were taken late in March from a pond  near the west side of Slim Buttes (5 mi. S and 14 mi. E Buffalo). Testes  of three adult males measured 17, 19, and 22; of three females, none  evidenced reproductive activity.      ~Mus musculus~ Linnaeus, 1758    House Mouse    The house mouse evidently is uncommon in rural environments in  northwestern South Dakota. One subadult female was trapped along a  \"weedy\" fencerow, 2 mi. N and 5 mi. W Ludlow.      ~Zapus hudsonius campestris~ Preble, 1899    Meadow Jumping Mouse    Eleven specimens of this jumping mouse were taken from a relict  population restricted to a shrub-grass habitat adjacent to a small  spring-fed stream and impoundment in Deer Draw (10 mi. S and 5 mi. W  Reva). Similar isolated populations may be present in the few other  suitable mesic habitats in Harding County, but we have trapped  extensively, yet unsuccessfully, for _Zapus_ in such situations;  specimens are known, however, from the Long Pine Hills and from along  the Little Missouri River in adjacent Carter County, Montana. It is of  interest that a relict population of _Peromyscus leucopus_ also occurs  in Deer Draw.    The testes of two adult males obtained on June 3 measured 7, whereas  those of one taken on May 16 measured 16. Seven embryos (measuring 8 in  crown-rump length) were carried by a molting female trapped on June 16.  Our specimens of _Zapus_, currently under study by Paul B. Robertson,  appear to be intergrades between the subspecies _campestris_ and  _intermedius_, but resemble the former more closely than the latter.      ~Erethizon dorsatum bruneri~ Swenk, 1916    Porcupine    _Specimens examined_ (11).--NW 1/4 sec. 15, R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 1; 2 mi. N,  5 mi. W Ludlow, 3; 4 mi. S, 7 mi. W Ladner, 1; 10 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva,  1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 4; 2 mi. S, 5 mi. E Harding, 1.    The porcupine is a common resident of the pine-clad buttes of Harding  County and individuals were occasionally encountered some distance from  pines. We noted porcupines almost nightly in June of 1961 along the road  that parallels the Slim Buttes to the east, and found a number that had  been struck by automobiles along this and other roadways in, or adjacent  to, wooded areas. Visher (1914:90) earlier reported _Erethizon_ from  Harding County.      Order Carnivora      ~Canis latrans latrans~ Say, 1823    Coyote    _Specimens examined_ (8).--North Cave Hills, 1; N of Slim Buttes, 1; N  end Slim Buttes, 1; 6 mi. N, 4 mi. W Camp Crook, 2; W of East Short Pine  Hills, 1; E of Short Pine Hills, 1; Sheep Mountain, 1.    The coyote population in Harding County and adjacent areas is low owing  to an active predator control program that is supported by local  ranchers and by state and federal agencies. Our field parties neither  saw nor heard coyotes, although tracks were found at one or two places  in March of 1963. According to Robert Kriege (personal communication),  the few coyotes that do reside in the area find refuge in the most  rugged parts of the hills and buttes. Visher (1914:90) reported that  this carnivore was \"generally considered as abundant.\" Our specimens all  are skulls of individuals killed by a federal trapper in the winter of  1961-62.      ~Canis lupus nubilus~ Say, 1823    Gray Wolf    Visher (1914:90) stated that wolves were \"quite plentiful\" in the early  1900's; he quoted figures for a two-month period in 1910 when a  government trapper took five adults and 25 pups in the vicinity of the  Short Pine Hills and two adults and 11 pups in the general area of the  Cave Hills. According to local residents, wolves were common in Harding  County in the 1920's. One (the famous \"Three Toes\") trapped 20 mi. NW  Buffalo in July of 1925 had eluded capture for more than 13 years, and  in that period caused an estimated $50,000 in damage to livestock  (Young, 1944:259, 277). It seems likely that the skull of this animal,  in the U.S. National Museum, is the one referred to by Goldman  (1944:445).    Wolves apparently had become rare by about 1930. The last one known to  have been killed in northwestern South Dakota was taken on January 27,  1945, near Red Elm, Ziebach County (Carl Cornell, personal  communication). We have seen a photograph of this wolf, which was  mounted and now is on display in Deadwood, South Dakota.    As noted by Goldman (1944:442), the subspecies _nubilus_ probably is  extinct.      ~Vulpes vulpes regalis~ Merriam, 1900    Red Fox    _Specimens examined_ (6).--1 mi. S, 5 mi. E Ladner, 3; 3 mi. S, 12 mi. E  Ludlow, 1; 2 mi. W Camp Crook, 3200 ft., 1; 4 mi. S, 1 mi. E Buffalo, 1.    "]]]
