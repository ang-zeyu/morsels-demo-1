Suddenly the time of arrival shifted to (early) August,  and has so remained. In Charles Schweder's experience, the bucks nearly  every year precede the does on the southward migration; this suggests  that at least the majority of the bucks may not go so far north as the  does. In a certain year the does actually appeared first in coming  south. In normal years, according to Fred Schweder, Jr., the migration  continues till October or November, by which time the animals have  passed into the wooded country for the winter.    Charles Schweder described the general pattern of fall migration as  follows. At first two or three animals will appear, then a few more, and  after several days a big movement, lasting three or four days, will pass  through. Thereafter the numbers dwindle, though the migration continues.  Curiously enough, there is a definite retrograde movement northward into  the Barrens in September--sometimes as early as the first part of the  month. Then there is a final movement toward the south in November, at  the time of the first good snows; the largest herds of the year may then  be seen. Just how far the migration in 1947 conformed to this pattern  (outlined in early August) will be seen in the following pages.    The big August movement occurs occasionally as early as the first days  of the month, whereas it was delayed till the last week in 1947. About  the first of August, 1943, according to Fred Schweder, Jr., a thousand  Caribou swam across the mouth of Windy River in the course of an hour,  and there were other thousands during a two weeks' period. But such a  large migration strikes this point only once in several years. In other  years it may pass southward farther to the west, as in the vicinity of  Simons' Lake.    In the fall of 1946--the very season when the Caribou bypassed the  Eskimo camps on the upper Kazan River--there were said to have been far  more than the normal numbers in the Windy River area. Thousands passed  in one day, about October 10. The hills about Four-hill Creek then gave  Fred Schweder, Jr., the impression of \"moving with Deer.\" By comparison,  the numbers along the Windy River in 1947 were considered by the local  residents to have been below normal, however impressive they may have  been to a zoological visitor. On the other hand, it seemed to Charles  Schweder, during his trip down the Thlewiaza River in late August of  1947, that Caribou were still very numerous; and he reported that people  along the west coast of Hudson Bay were then getting more of the animals  than in previous years.    Only rarely do limited numbers of Caribou remain all winter in the Windy  River area. During Charles Schweder's years of residence there (about  1936-47) the animals had done so just once--on the Windy Hills. In  1946-47 Fred Schweder, Jr., found about 300 of them remaining all winter  about the north end of Ennadai Lake. He said that the locally wintering  animals are all bucks. Katello, an elderly Eskimo of the upper Kazan  River, informed Charles Schweder that the Caribou used to remain there  all winter, but now very rarely do so.    By the end of July, after both men and dogs had subsisted for several  weeks on a diet devoid of caribou meat, an air of expectancy began to  pervade the Windy River camp. The hunters roamed the Barrens or watched  from some lookout post such as the Pile o' Rocks (fig. 27). No Caribou  were detected during plane trips to the upper Kazan River and return on  July 31 and August 3, though their ancient, well-marked trails were  visible along the ridges. It was not until August 6 that the first buck  of the return movement was encountered. On the following day another  animal was secured. On August 10 and 11 only a few Caribou--not over 25  in a band--were seen by Charles Schweder and Fred Schweder, Jr., from  the air between the Windy and the Kazan rivers. It began to be feared  that the bulk of the migration might pass somewhere to the westward. On  August 13, however, at a distance of some miles from camp, Fred sighted  20 Caribou; all of them were does and fawns except for one buck. On  August 17 he secured a good-sized buck (specimen No. 1065; figs. 3, 4)  at Bear Slough and saw five other bucks elsewhere. Two days later  Anoteelik reported a band of 13.    On August 20 Fred reported about 300 Caribou moving in our direction  across the Barrens east of Lake Charles; they proved to be the advance  guard of a big movement. On the same afternoon I had filmed several  bucks going their separate ways on the slopes about Pile o' Rocks and  Stony Man. They were moving along somewhat hurriedly, in a manner very  different from the placid grazing of sheep or cattle. One or two does  with fawns also appeared in the vicinity. (The passage of a Keewatin  Tundra Wolf over the same ground a short time previously had no effect,  as far as I observed, on the behavior of the animals at this time.)  A grander, though more distant, spectacle gradually unfolded off to the  eastward, beyond Little River, where several groups, numbering from 3 to  20 or 25 individuals, were feeding quietly over the open Barrens. Their  fresh dark autumn coats showed up much more conspicuously than had the  cream-buff of their winter coats in June. Presently the scene became  livelier, as the largest band, composed of does and fawns as well as  lordly bucks, started to romp northward over the Barrens. One or more of  the various kinds of insects that bring life-long misery to the Caribou  may have stampeded them. This band swept past a group of half its size  without at once involving it. A doe and a fawn remained lying down as  the others passed.    As the eye swept farther over that lonely land, still other Caribou were  disclosed singly or in groups scattered over a couple of square miles.  There was no strong herd instinct as they grazed at will. Even when on  the march, they straggled along, some as much as 20 to 30 yards apart.  As the sun sank lower, and the black flies became less active with the  dropping temperature (about 53°), a lull ensued in the movements of the  Caribou.    The big movement of the fall migration finally began to materialize on  Sunday, August 24. This and the next few days were filled with memorable  experiences. The throngs of Caribou passing at such times around the  head of Windy Bay and across the lowermost portions of Little and Windy  rivers may be accounted for, in part, by the local topography (map 1).  The upper part of Windy Bay, occupied by numerous islands of various  sizes and extending about 5 miles in an east-west direction, opposes  something of a barrier to the Caribou in their southward trek. The  easiest way to overcome this barrier is to by-pass it. So the migrant  herds approaching the north shore of the bay turn westward toward Little  River. At a point half a mile short of this stream a rather minor  proportion of the Caribou actually do essay a passage of Windy Bay. They  cross an island lying very close to the north shore, then steer for a  small rocky islet a quarter of a mile northwest of the mouth of South  Bay. Here they get a brief respite from swimming by walking through the  shallow bordering waters, then continue straight on to the rugged south  shore of Windy Bay. This course is roughly parallel to, and a quarter of  a mile west of, the one pursued northward or northeastward across the  ice in the spring migration. The Caribou were seen to follow this water  route on various days from August 24 to September 8, and again on  October 7. Like the one across the ice, it is probably a regular,  well-established, annual route.    The greater number of the migrants proceed along the north shore of the  bay to Little River and are there confronted with a choice of various  further routes. Some continue for an indefinite distance up the  northeastern bank, passing Lake Charles on their right, though other  animals, coming from the north, may be following this bank in the  opposite direction. Probably most of the Caribou arriving from the  eastward either plunge into Little River at its mouth and swim across  (figs. 9, 10, 12) or pass upstream for a bare quarter of a mile and then  wade across at a rapid (figs. 7, 8).    Without human interference, a large proportion of those that cross the  lower part of Little River would doubtless proceed more or less directly  to Windy River and cross near its mouth. But the human and canine  inhabitants of the Windy River post seem to exert a strong influence in  deflecting the Caribou northwestward along several more or less parallel  ridges that rise to a maximum height of 40 or 50 feet. These are Little  River, Middle, and Camp ridges (map 1). Many animals follow the first of  these to its northwestern end, then cross a bog and ascend the Middle  Ridge. Some cross the southeastern end of Little River Ridge, scramble  down its steep sides by strongly marked trails (fig. 2), and then move  across the Eastern Bog to the Middle Ridge. But when they reach the  summit, they can see the post directly ahead, and generally hurry off  northwestward along the ridge. Presently some may cross the Camp Slough  (fig. 13) to the Camp Ridge and then proceed either westward or  northwestward. The Caribou have a strong predilection for following the  treeless summits of the ridges wherever they are available and extend in  a more or less desirable direction. On reaching the vicinity of the Bear  Slough, where the three ridges are interrupted or peter out, the animals  doubtless turn more or less southwestward to make a passage of Windy  River at various points above its mouth. Under the conditions outlined  above, it is obvious that some of the finest opportunities for  close-range observation and photography lie at the two well-established  crossings near the mouth of Little River.

Bake half an        hour, basting twice over the paper.    {Footer: Swift's Premium Oleomargarine reduces the cost of good living.}      To serve beef cannelon, remove the paper, place the roll on the        platter, and pour over it    Tomato Sauce      1 tablespoonful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1 cupful strained tomatoes    1 teaspoonful onion juice    1 tablespoonful flour    1/4 teaspoonful white pepper    1 bay-leaf      Add onion, bay leaf, salt and pepper to tomatoes. Rub the        oleomargarine and flour together and place in inner kettle of        oatmeal cooker, set over the fire, add the tomato, and stir until        it boils. Then place the kettle over hot water in the lower half        of the oatmeal cooker, and cook so for ten minutes, when it is        ready to serve.      Spanish Minced Beef in Meat Box    (Very pretty and palatable)    Use any of the cheaper cuts.    The Filling      1 tablespoonful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1 onion chopped fine    6 sweet peppers cut in strips    4 tomatoes peeled, cut in halves and seeds squeezed out    1/2 teaspoonful salt      Make the filling first. Put the oleomargarine in upper half of an        oatmeal kettle, add onion and peppers, and simmer gently for        twenty minutes.      Then add the tomato halves cut into three or four pieces each and cook        twenty minutes longer. Then add salt and pepper and set over hot        water in lower half of kettle to keep hot till wanted. Now make        the    Meat Box      2 pounds uncooked beef chopped fine    1 egg unbeaten    1 teaspoonful salt    1/4 teaspoonful pepper      Work all well together. Form into a box whose sides are about an inch        thick. Place this box on a piece of oiled paper in the bottom of        a baking-pan and bake in a quick oven for thirty minutes, basting        twice with melted oleomargarine.      To serve, lift box carefully, and place on platter and pour the        filling into the center, and send at once to the table.    {Footer: Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is a delicious, wholesome spread  for bread.}      Beef a la Mode    Use Clod (9) or Under Round (5)      The day before the beef is to be served rub it all over with the        following, well mixed together:--      1/2 teaspoonful ground cloves    1 teaspoonful ground ginger    1/2 teaspoonful ground allspice    1/2 teaspoonful ground cinnamon    1/2 teaspoonful white pepper      Then sprinkle the beef with about two tablespoonfuls vinegar and let        stand overnight. Next day put in the bottom of the roasting pan:--      1 cupful small white button onions (chopped onion will do)    1 cupful carrot cut in dice    1/2 teaspoonful celery-seed    1 bay-leaf    4 cupfuls Swift's beef extract or of stock    2 tablespoonfuls gelatine that has been soaked in cold water for    half an hour      Lay the meat on the vegetables in the pan, cover closely, and set in        an exceedingly hot oven until the meat has browned a little; then        reduce the temperature of the oven, and cook very slowly for four        hours, basting frequently.      Serve garnished with the vegetables. Make a brown sauce from the stock        left in the pan.      This is a very good way to prepare meat in warm weather, as the spices        enable it to be kept well for over a week. It is excellent served        cold with    Creamed Horseradish Sauce      4 tablespoonfuls grated horseradish with the vinegar drained off    1/4 teaspoonful salt    6 tablespoonfuls thick cream    Yolk of 1 egg      Add the salt and egg-yolk to the horseradish and mix thoroughly; whip        the cream stiff, and fold it in carefully and send at once to        table.    {Footer: Have you seen Swift's Premium Oleomargarine? Its appearance is  appetizing.}      Boiled Beef    Use cuts from (1), (8), (9), (11)      Put the trimmings and suet of the beef into a large kettle and try        out the fat.      Remove the cracklings or scraps and into the hot fat put the meat and        turn quickly until it is red on all sides.      Cover completely with boiling water and boil rapidly for five minutes,        then turn down the gas or remove kettle to back of coal range so        that the water cannot possibly boil again, and cook fifteen        minutes to each pound of meat.      One hour before it is done add one tablespoonful salt and one-quarter        teaspoonful pepper.      When done garnish with watercress, or boiled cabbage, or vegetables.      The liquor in which the meat was boiled can be saved for soup, or made        into brown sauce to serve with it.      Left-over boiled beef may be served cold cut in thin slices, or made        into croquettes, or into meat and potato roll, or into various        warmed-over dishes.      Steak en Casserole    Use a Round Steak (5) 1 inch thick      2 pounds uncooked steak cut in pieces 2 inches square    1 cupful small white button onions    1 tablespoonful chopped parsley    1/2 cupful carrot cut in dice    1/2 cupful white turnip cut in dice    1/4 teaspoonful celery-seed    1 teaspoonful salt    1/4 teaspoonful white pepper    2 cupfuls Swift's beef extract or of stock boiling hot      Cover the bottom of the casserole with a layer of the mixed        vegetables.      Put in an iron frying-pan over the fire to heat. When hot, rub over        the bottom with a piece of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. Lay in        the pieces of steak and brown quickly on both sides. Remove them        from the frying-pan and arrange on the vegetables in the        casserole. Cover them with the remaining vegetables. Sprinkle over        the celery-seed, salt, and pepper, and then pour the hot stock        over all. Cover the dish and bake for one hour in a quick oven.      Steak en Casserole should be sent to the table in the same dish in        which it is cooked. The steak should be brown and tender, the        vegetables slightly brown, and the stock nearly all absorbed.    {Footer: Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is U. S. Government Inspected and  Passed.}      Beef Loaf    Use cuts from Chuck (1) or the Round (5)      4 pounds uncooked meat chopped fine    2 cupfuls bread-crumbs    2 tablespoonfuls chopped parsley    1 level teaspoonful pepper    4 eggs unbeaten    1 large onion chopped fine    2 rounding teaspoonfuls salt      Mix meat and onion. Add the dry ingredients next. Mix well, then add        the eggs. Pack all down hard in a square bread-pan so the loaf        will take the form of the pan.      Bake for two hours in a moderately quick oven, basting every fifteen        minutes with hot Swift's Beef Extract or hot stock. When done, set        away in the pan until cold.      To serve, turn out on a platter and cut in thin slices and serve with        catsup or with cream horseradish sauce. Recipe for the latter is        given under \"Beef a la Mode.\"      Little Beef Cakes    Use any of the cheaper cuts      1 pound uncooked beef chopped fine    1 tablespoonful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1 tablespoonful flour    1/2 teaspoonful salt    1 tablespoonful grated onion    2 cupfuls beef extract or stock    1 teaspoonful kitchen bouquet    1/4 teaspoonful white pepper      Shape the meat into little cakes. Put the oleomargarine in a        frying-pan, and when hot lay in the cakes and brown quickly on        both sides. Then remove the cakes.      Into the oleomargarine left in the pan put the flour and brown. Then        add the stock gradually, stirring all the time so there will be no        lumps. When smooth add the seasonings. Then lay in the beef cakes,        cover, and cook slowly for five minutes. Serve at once with the        sauce poured over them.    {Footer: Have you tried Swift's Premium Oleomargarine? It is worth  trying.}      Curry Balls    Use any of the cheaper cuts      1 pound uncooked beef chopped fine    2 tablespoonfuls Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1 tablespoonful flour    1 level teaspoonful salt    1 teaspoonful curry-powder    1 onion chopped    1 cupful strained tomatoes    1/4 teaspoonful white pepper      Make the meat into little balls. Put one tablespoon oleomargarine in        frying-pan, and in it cook the onion slowly without browning it        until the onion is soft. Then add the curry-powder and meat        balls, and shake the pan over a quick fire for ten minutes.      Put the second tablespoonful oleomargarine in another frying-pan, and        when hot add to it the flour. Stir well, then add the salt, pepper        and tomato. Let come to a boil and then pour over the meat balls.        Cover and cook slowly for five minutes.      Curry balls are nicest served with boiled rice.      Smothered Beef with Corn Pudding    Use any of the cheaper cuts      2 pounds uncooked beef chopped fine    1 level teaspoonful salt    2 tablespoonfuls Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1/4 teaspoonful pepper      This meat should be free from fat. Have ready an iron pan very hot.        Put the chopped meat in it and set in a very hot oven for fifteen        minutes, stirring it once or twice. Then add the oleomargarine,        salt and pepper, and serve at once with    Corn Pudding      1 can corn    1 cupful milk    1 level teaspoonful salt    1 teaspoonful baking-powder    1/4 teaspoonful white pepper    3 eggs    1-3/4 cupfuls flour      Mix corn with milk,"]]]
