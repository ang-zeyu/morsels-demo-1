Only static.    \"I don't get anything. They may hear me but they may not want to  answer.\"    \"Tell them it's an emergency.\"    \"They'll think I'm being forced to call. Under your direction.\" He  tried again, outlining briefly what he had learned. But still the  phone was silent, except for the faint static.    \"Radiation pools kill most transmission,\" Klaus said, after awhile.  \"Maybe that's it.\"    Hendricks shut the transmitter up. \"No use. No answer. Radiation  pools? Maybe. Or they hear me, but won't answer. Frankly, that's what  I would do, if a runner tried to call from the Soviet lines. They have  no reason to believe such a story. They may hear everything I say--\"    \"Or maybe it's too late.\"    Hendricks nodded.    \"We better get the lid down,\" Rudi said nervously. \"We don't want to  take unnecessary chances.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They climbed slowly back down the tunnel. Klaus bolted the lid  carefully into place. They descended into the kitchen. The air was  heavy and close around them.    \"Could they work that fast?\" Hendricks said. \"I left the bunker this  noon. Ten hours ago. How could they move so quickly?\"    \"It doesn't take them long. Not after the first one gets in. It goes  wild. You know what the little claws can do. Even _one_ of these is  beyond belief. Razors, each finger. Maniacal.\"    \"All right.\" Hendricks moved away impatiently. He stood with his back  to them.    \"What's the matter?\" Rudi said.    \"The Moon Base. God, if they've gotten there--\"    \"The Moon Base?\"    Hendricks turned around. \"They couldn't have got to the Moon Base. How  would they get there? It isn't possible. I can't believe it.\"    \"What is this Moon Base? We've heard rumors, but nothing definite.  What is the actual situation? You seem concerned.\"    \"We're supplied from the moon. The governments are there, under the  lunar surface. All our people and industries. That's what keeps us  going. If they should find some way of getting off Terra, onto the  moon--\"    \"It only takes one of them. Once the first one gets in it admits the  others. Hundreds of them, all alike. You should have seen them.  Identical. Like ants.\"    \"Perfect socialism,\" Tasso said. \"The ideal of the communist state.  All citizens interchangeable.\"    Klaus grunted angrily. \"That's enough. Well? What next?\"    Hendricks paced back and forth, around the small room. The air was  full of smells of food and perspiration. The others watched him.  Presently Tasso pushed through the curtain, into the other room. \"I'm  going to take a nap.\"    The curtain closed behind her. Rudi and Klaus sat down at the table,  still watching Hendricks.    \"It's up to you,\" Klaus said. \"We don't know your situation.\"    Hendricks nodded.    \"It's a problem.\" Rudi drank some coffee, filling his cup from a rusty  pot. \"We're safe here for awhile, but we can't stay here forever. Not  enough food or supplies.\"    \"But if we go outside--\"    \"If we go outside they'll get us. Or probably they'll get us. We  couldn't go very far. How far is your command bunker, Major?\"    \"Three or four miles.\"    \"We might make it. The four of us. Four of us could watch all sides.  They couldn't slip up behind us and start tagging us. We have three  rifles, three blast rifles. Tasso can have my pistol.\" Rudi tapped his  belt. \"In the Soviet army we didn't have shoes always, but we had  guns. With all four of us armed one of us might get to your command  bunker. Preferably you, Major.\"    \"What if they're already there?\" Klaus said.    Rudi shrugged. \"Well, then we come back here.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks stopped pacing. \"What do you think the chances are they're  already in the American lines?\"    \"Hard to say. Fairly good. They're organized. They know exactly what  they're doing. Once they start they go like a horde of locusts. They  have to keep moving, and fast. It's secrecy and speed they depend on.  Surprise. They push their way in before anyone has any idea.\"    \"I see,\" Hendricks murmured.    From the other room Tasso stirred. \"Major?\"    Hendricks pushed the curtain back. \"What?\"    [Illustration]    Tasso looked up at him lazily from the cot. \"Have you any more  American cigarettes left?\"    Hendricks went into the room and sat down across from her, on a wood  stool. He felt in his pockets. \"No. All gone.\"    \"Too bad.\"    \"What nationality are you?\" Hendricks asked after awhile.    \"Russian.\"    \"How did you get here?\"    \"Here?\"    \"This used to be France. This was part of Normandy. Did you come with  the Soviet army?\"    \"Why?\"    \"Just curious.\" He studied her. She had taken off her coat, tossing it  over the end of the cot. She was young, about twenty. Slim. Her long  hair stretched out over the pillow. She was staring at him silently,  her eyes dark and large.    \"What's on your mind?\" Tasso said.    \"Nothing. How old are you?\"    \"Eighteen.\" She continued to watch him, unblinking, her arms behind  her head. She had on Russian army pants and shirt. Gray-green. Thick  leather belt with counter and cartridges. Medicine kit.    \"You're in the Soviet army?\"    \"No.\"    \"Where did you get the uniform?\"    She shrugged. \"It was given to me,\" she told him.    \"How--how old were you when you came here?\"    \"Sixteen.\"    \"That young?\"    Her eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks rubbed his jaw. \"Your life would have been a lot different  if there had been no war. Sixteen. You came here at sixteen. To live  this way.\"    \"I had to survive.\"    \"I'm not moralizing.\"    \"Your life would have been different, too,\" Tasso murmured. She  reached down and unfastened one of her boots. She kicked the boot off,  onto the floor. \"Major, do you want to go in the other room? I'm  sleepy.\"    \"It's going to be a problem, the four of us here. It's going to be  hard to live in these quarters. Are there just the two rooms?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How big was the cellar originally? Was it larger than this? Are there  other rooms filled up with debris? We might be able to open one of  them.\"    \"Perhaps. I really don't know.\" Tasso loosened her belt. She made  herself comfortable on the cot, unbuttoning her shirt. \"You're sure  you have no more cigarettes?\"    \"I had only the one pack.\"    \"Too bad. Maybe if we get back to your bunker we can find some.\" The  other boot fell. Tasso reached up for the light cord. \"Good night.\"    \"You're going to sleep?\"    \"That's right.\"    The room plunged into darkness. Hendricks got up and made his way past  the curtain, into the kitchen.    And stopped, rigid.    Rudi stood against the wall, his face white and gleaming. His mouth  opened and closed but no sounds came. Klaus stood in front of him, the  muzzle of his pistol in Rudi's stomach. Neither of them moved. Klaus,  his hand tight around his gun, his features set. Rudi, pale and  silent, spread-eagled against the wall.    \"What--\" Hendricks muttered, but Klaus cut him off.    \"Be quiet, Major. Come over here. Your gun. Get out your gun.\"    Hendricks drew his pistol. \"What is it?\"    \"Cover him.\" Klaus motioned him forward. \"Beside me. Hurry!\"    Rudi moved a little, lowering his arms. He turned to Hendricks,  licking his lips. The whites of his eyes shone wildly. Sweat dripped  from his forehead, down his cheeks. He fixed his gaze on Hendricks.  \"Major, he's gone insane. Stop him.\" Rudi's voice was thin and hoarse,  almost inaudible.    \"What's going on?\" Hendricks demanded.    Without lowering his pistol Klaus answered. \"Major, remember our  discussion? The Three Varieties? We knew about One and Three. But we  didn't know about Two. At least, we didn't know before.\" Klaus'  fingers tightened around the gun butt. \"We didn't know before, but we  know now.\"    He pressed the trigger. A burst of white heat rolled out of the gun,  licking around Rudi.    \"Major, this is the Second Variety.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tasso swept the curtain aside. \"Klaus! What did you do?\"    Klaus turned from the charred form, gradually sinking down the wall  onto the floor. \"The Second Variety, Tasso. Now we know. We have all  three types identified. The danger is less. I--\"    Tasso stared past him at the remains of Rudi, at the blackened,  smouldering fragments and bits of cloth. \"You killed him.\"    \"Him? _It_, you mean. I was watching. I had a feeling, but I wasn't  sure. At least, I wasn't sure before. But this evening I was certain.\"  Klaus rubbed his pistol butt nervously. \"We're lucky. Don't you  understand? Another hour and it might--\"    \"You were _certain_?\" Tasso pushed past him and bent down, over the  steaming remains on the floor. Her face became hard. \"Major, see for  yourself. Bones. Flesh.\"    Hendricks bent down beside her. The remains were human remains. Seared  flesh, charred bone fragments, part of a skull. Ligaments, viscera,  blood. Blood forming a pool against the wall.    \"No wheels,\" Tasso said calmly. She straightened up. \"No wheels, no  parts, no relays. Not a claw. Not the Second Variety.\" She folded her  arms. \"You're going to have to be able to explain this.\"    Klaus sat down at the table, all the color drained suddenly from his  face. He put his head in his hands and rocked back and forth.    \"Snap out of it.\" Tasso's fingers closed over his shoulder. \"Why did  you do it? Why did you kill him?\"    \"He was frightened,\" Hendricks said. \"All this, the whole thing,  building up around us.\"    \"Maybe.\"    \"What, then? What do you think?\"    \"I think he may have had a reason for killing Rudi. A good reason.\"    \"What reason?\"    \"Maybe Rudi learned something.\"    Hendricks studied her bleak face. \"About what?\" he asked.    \"About him. About Klaus.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Klaus looked up quickly. \"You can see what she's trying to say. She  thinks I'm the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32069"],[0,"Letters from a Cat (#5)"],[1,"all night, and it hurt me  terribly whenever I moved. Early in the morning your grandfather came  downstairs, and when he saw how I looked, he swore again, that same  oath: we all know very well what it means when he swears in that way: it  means that he is going to do all he can for you, and is so sorry, that  he is afraid of seeming too sorry. Don't you remember when you had that  big double tooth pulled out, and he gave you five dollars, how he swore  then? Well, he took me up in his arms, and carried me into the  dining-room; it was quite cool; there was a nice wood fire on the  hearth, and Mary was setting the table for breakfast. He said to her in  a very gruff voice, \"Here you, Mary, you go up into the garret and  bring down the cradle.\"    Sick as I was, I could not help laughing at the sight of her face. It  was enough to make any cat laugh.    \"You don't ever mean to say, sir, as you're going to put that cat into  the cradle.\"    \"You do as I tell you,\" said he, in that most awful tone of his, which  always makes you so afraid. I felt afraid myself, though all the time he  was stroking my head, and saying, \"Poor pussy, there, poor pussy, lie  still.\" In a few minutes Mary came down with the cradle, and set it  down by the fire with such a bang that I wondered it did not break. You  know she always bangs things when she is cross, but I never could see  what good it does. Then your grandfather made up a nice bed in the  cradle, out of Charlie's winter blanket and an old pillow, and laid me  down in it, all rolled up as I was in your petticoat. When your mother  came into the room she laughed almost as hard as she did when she saw me  in the soft-soap barrel, and said, \"Why, father, you are rather old to  play cat's cradle!\" The old gentleman laughed at this, till the tears  ran down his red cheeks. \"Well,\" he said, \"I tell you one thing; the  game will last me till that poor cat gets well again.\" Then he went  upstairs, and brought down a bottle of something very soft and slippery,  like lard, and put it on my eyes, and it made them feel much better.  After that he gave me some milk into which he had put some of his very  best brandy: that was pretty hard to get down, but I understood enough  of what they had said, to be sure that if I did not take something of  the kind I should never get well. After breakfast I tried to walk, but  my right paw was entirely useless. At first they thought it was broken,  but finally decided that it was only sprained, and must be bandaged. The  bandages were wet with something which smelled so badly it made me feel  very sick, for the first day or two. Cats' noses are much more sensitive  to smells than people's are; but I grew used to it, and it did my poor  lame paw so much good that I would have borne it if it had smelled twice  as badly. For three days I had to lie all the time in the cradle: if  your grandfather caught me out of it, he would swear at me, and put me  back again. Every morning he put the soft white stuff on my eyes, and  changed the bandages on my leg. And, oh, my dear Helen, such good things  as I had to eat! I had almost the same things for my dinner that the  rest of them did: it must be a splendid thing to be a man or a woman! I  do not think I shall ever again be contented to eat in the shed, and  have only the old pieces which nobody wants.    Two things troubled me very much while I was confined to the cradle: one  was that everybody who came in to see your mother laughed as if they  never could stop, at the first sight of me; and the other was that I  heard poor Caesar mewing all around the house, and calling me with all  his might; and I knew he thought I was dead. I tried hard to make your  kind mother notice his crying, for I knew she would be willing to let  him come in and see me, but I could not make her understand. I suppose  she thought it was only some common strolling cat who was hungry. I have  always noticed that people do not observe any difference between one  cat's voice and another's; now they really are just as different as  human voices. Caesar has one of the finest, deepest-toned voices I  ever heard. One day, after I got well enough to be in the kitchen, he  slipped in, between the legs of the butcher's boy who was bringing in  some meat; but before I had time to say one word to him, Mary flew at  him with the broom, and drove him out. However, he saw that I was alive,  and that was something. I am afraid it will be some days yet before I  can see him again, for they do not let me go out at all, and the  bandages are not taken off my leg. The cradle is carried upstairs, and I  sleep on Charlie's blanket behind the stove. I heard your mother say  to-day that she really believed the cat had the rheumatism. I do not  know what that is, but I think I have got it: it hurts me all over when  I walk, and I feel as if I looked like Bill Jacobs's old cat, who, they  say, is older than the oldest man in town; but of course that must be a  slander.    The thing I am most concerned about is my fur; it is coming off in  spots: there is a bare spot on the back of my neck, on the place by  which they lifted me up out of the soap barrel, half as large as your  hand; and whenever I wash myself, I get my mouth full of hairs, which  is very disagreeable. I heard your grandfather say to-day, that he  believed he would try Mrs. Somebody's Hair Restorer on the cat, at which  everybody laughed so that ran out of the room as fast as I could go, and  then they laughed still harder. I will write you again in a day or two,  and tell you how I am getting on. I hope you will come home soon.         Your affectionate Pussy.         [Illustration: \"Then your grandfather made up a nice bed in the       cradle, and laid me down in it.\"--Page 76.]         [Illustration: \"One day he slipped in between the legs of the       butcher boy, but before I had time to say a word to him, Mary flew       at him with the broom.\"--Page 81.]          VII.      My Dear Helen:    I am so glad to know that you are coming home next week, that I cannot  think of any thing else. There is only one drawback to my pleasure, and  that is, I am so ashamed to have you see me in such a plight. I told  you, in my last letter, that my fur was beginning to come off. Your  grandfather has tried several things of his, which are said to be good  for hair; but they have not had the least effect. For my part I don't  see why they should; fur and hair are two very different things, and I  thought at the outset there was no use in putting on my skin what was  intended for the skin of human heads, and even on them don't seem to  work any great wonders, if I can judge from your grandfather's head,  which you know is as bald and pink and shiny as a baby's. However, he  has been so good to me, that I let him do any thing he likes, and every  day he rubs in some new kind of stuff, which smells a little worse than  the last one. It is utterly impossible for me to get within half a mile  of a rat or a mouse. I might as well fire off a gun to let them know I  am coming, as to go about scented up so that they can smell me a great  deal farther off than they can see me. If it were not for this dreadful  state of my fur, I should be perfectly happy, for I feel much better  than I ever did before in my whole life, and am twice as fat as when you  went away. I try to be resigned to whatever may be in store for me, but  it is very hard to look forward to being a fright all the rest of one's  days. I don't suppose such a thing was ever seen in the world as a cat  without any fur. This morning your grandfather sat looking at me for a  long time and stroking his chin: at last he said, \"Do you suppose it  would do any good to shave the cat all over?\" At this I could not resist  the impulse to scream, and your mother said, \"I do believe the creature  knows whenever we speak about her.\" Of course I do! Why in the world  shouldn't I! People never seem to observe that cats have ears. I often  think how much more careful they would be if they did. I have many a  time to see them send children out of the room, and leave me behind,  when I knew perfectly well that the children would neither notice nor  understand half so much as I would. There are some houses in which I  lived, before I came to live with you, about which I could tell strange  stories if I chose.    Caesar pretends that he likes the looks of little spots of pink skin,  here and there, in fur; but I know he only does it to save my feelings,  for it isn't in human nature--I mean in cat's nature--that any one  should. You see I spend so much more time in the society of men and  women than of cats, that I find myself constantly using expressions  which sound queerly in a cat's mouth. But you know me well enough to be  sure that every thing I say is perfectly natural. And now, my dear  Helen, I hope I have prepared you to see me looking perfectly hideous. I  only trust that your love for me will not be entirely killed by my  unfortunate appearance. If you do seem to love me less, I shall be  wretched, but I shall still be, always,    Your affectionate Pussy."]]]
