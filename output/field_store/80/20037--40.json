(#5)"],[1," skin, I cannot say; but it is certain that  when, after darkness had settled on the earth and all around was silent,  I ventured to descend from my hiding-place, I succeeded in making my way  out of the \"preserve,\" and park beyond, in safety, when I took to my  heels with all speed; nor did I stop till I had reached my own quiet  home, which I stealthily entered through an open window.          A NEW LEAF.      A great change was made in my manner of life very soon after this last  adventure, which may be looked upon as the closing scene of my wild and  thoughtless Kittenhood. I was now entering upon a new course of  existence, where far different pursuits had to engage my attention.    A distant relation of my mother's, who had never been married (a very  singular circumstance in our city), and who lived in a house with only  two servants to keep her company, invited me to spend some time with  her, and, as she was very clever and accomplished, my mother was most  pleased to let me go, as she considered that I might obtain great  advantages from her society and conversation.    The sort of life I had been leading made my first days spent at Hum  Villa very dull and tedious, for my cousin, although most gentle and  kind, was precise to an extraordinary degree, and could not bear the  least disorder either in her house, her person, or the manners or  appearance of those about her. Truly both she and her servants were  orderly enough; for they were washing at least ten times a day, and  never sat down to a meal or got up from it without licking themselves  all over for a good half hour.    By degrees however what seemed to me irksome and fussy wore  imperceptibly away, and I was not long in discovering that cleanliness  of body has a good deal to do with promoting purity of mind. I am  certain it was so with myself; for as I got into habits of preciseness,  and put my tongue to the use for which nature in part designed it,  namely the washing and cleansing my person, my thoughts took a very  different turn, and, after a few months, I should have avoided with  horror many of those companions with whom I had been formerly so  friendly, if they had, by any chance, been thrown in my way.    But this was only one of the changes which my residence with my cousin  wrought in me. I had never before met with a Cat who had seen so much or  who had read so many books as she. Her memory too was so good that she  could relate all she had seen and much that she had read, and, as she  had gone on _thinking_, as well as seeing and reading, her conversation,  when I came to know her well, was delightful.    She had been into other countries; she had seen places inhabited by  animals different to those which lived in Caneville; she had even  learned to understand and speak their language. She told me she had  read that there were cities filled with creatures called _men_, who  considered themselves superior to all other beasts, which they used as  slaves and killed for food. When I asked her, if there were any Cats  living among these creatures--these men? she replied, there were a great  many; but that they were looked upon as poor, miserable things, were  often badly treated, and, at the best, were rather tolerated than liked,  and never enjoyed the full confidence of their harsh masters.    In such discourse we spent a great deal of time: little by little my  views became enlarged, and as she spoke to me of the noble nature of  some of the animals she had met with upon her travels, the acts of  kindness she had received from them, and the deeds by which many of  them had rendered themselves famous, I began to appreciate more justly  the position which we Cats occupied in the scale of creation. Not that  I was desirous of changing my lot for that of any other beast; but  I learned to look with more humility upon myself and my tribe, and  understood that many things were better managed in other countries,  and by other animals, than _we_ managed them in Caneville.    But none of my good cousin's accomplishments pleased me so much as her  perfect knowledge of music. She played several instruments in a charming  and graceful manner, and her voice was so sweet that when she sang, and  accompanied herself on the piano, it was most delightful to hear her.    She soon perceived my fondness for the science, and promised, if I were  attentive and would follow her instructions, to teach me both to play  and sing. No proposal could have been more pleasing to me. I thanked her  a hundred times, and resolved to use my best efforts to do credit to my  preceptress's instructions, and make myself mistress of so charming an  acquirement.    I now began to study in good earnest. Under the guidance of my real  friend I made great progress: I soon learned both to read and write;  acquired a slight knowledge of other tongues, and made such proficiency  in music as, in the opinion of my cousin, to perform many pieces with as  much grace and dexterity as herself. I could sing, too, pretty well; but  my voice was still weak and tremulous, and wanted the full tone and  power of her own.    How happily the days now passed! How thankful did I feel to my cousin,  to my good mother, to my fortunate lot, which thus gave me the means  of acquiring an education that placed me so far above most of my  fellow-Cats!    These thoughts however awakened such pride in my bosom, that I began to  look upon Pussies who had not been blessed with the same advantages as  myself, as beings so inferior that I would scarce deign to look on them.  One or two Tommies, who ventured to cast tender looks upon me as I  passed through the streets or peeped out of the window, I treated with  scorn; and when _one_, dressed in glossy black, ventured one day to  speak to me as I was returning from my mother's house, I was even so  rude as not only to set up my back at him, but actually spit in his  face.    Conduct of this kind is certain to meet with punishment; and my  mentioning the circumstance now is a proof that I have no wish to spare  myself, and that I heartily regret having ever been guilty of such  behaviour.    My pride was destined to meet with a severe fall, and sorrow was about  to take the place of happiness.    I had been about a year residing with my cousin, when our city was  visited with a terrible malady, which destroyed many of the inhabitants.  It commenced in the low and dirty parts of the town, where the poor curs  and mongrels lived, in those miserable huts unfit for any dog, but which  poverty obliged many of them to dwell in. It soon extended to the Cats'  quarter, and some of the best families were swept off by the infection.    Death was particularly busy in my own family: my father fell first, then  two of my sisters, and, at last, my mother! Her loss was heaviest of  all; and I had scarce recovered from the shock when my kind friend, my  good cousin, also caught the disease, and quickly passed away.    One would have thought that these various calamities, coming so quickly  upon each other, would have destroyed me at once, or would have so far  affected me as to kill me by degrees. The very greatest of them however  seemed to produce a contrary effect, and I, who would sometimes mourn  for days over a trifling misfortune, found myself sad indeed, but calm  under these heavy losses.    The disease passed away; and when I was sufficiently recovered to  examine my position, I saw myself mistress of a fine house, left me by  my poor cousin, with all her books, papers, musical instruments, and  other things, too numerous to mention.    It was on looking over the store of articles which I became thus  unexpectedly possessed of, that I discovered a bundle of letters,  written in a bold, Cat-like style. Although the ink had become pale with  time, and many parts were torn into holes, I yet managed to make out  their contents, and learn that they had been written to my cousin in her  youth by some Cat of noble birth, who had wished to marry her, but whose  attentions she had for some reason refused. Perhaps she had regretted it  afterwards, and for that reason had always lived alone; perhaps he had  died, or left the city, or----a number of ideas came into my mind about  him, and I even tried to imagine what he was like, and whether he at all  resembled the Tom in black I had been so rude to some time before.    [Illustration: A SELECT CLASS.]    I then began to consider what I should do with the packet. When I  reflected that my cousin had never mentioned the subject, or even the  name of her correspondent, I thought the only plan was to be equally  silent, and, in order to avoid the remarks of others, put the letters in  the fire; for, although I had read them myself, I felt quite persuaded  she had no wish that they should be generally known. My resolution was  soon taken; and casting the papers one by one into the flames, I watched  them slowly burn until there was a little black heap of ashes on the  hearth. The last letter was in my paw; I tore it in halves, and threw  the first sheet on to the pile; the second was just going the same  way, when my eye caught sight of two verses of a song, which I had not  observed till then. I stopped and read them through: they were stanzas  I had sometimes heard my cousin sing; and although I do not think so much  of them now as I did at the time, I preserved them from the flames, and  now insert them here in memory of so kind and gentle a Cat:--        With others I may frisk and play,      With others I may talk and sing,    With others pass the live-long day,      And find, time flies with rapid wing:    A friend (I seek not to deceive)      I may, perchance, to others be;    But, ah! my darling Puss! believe,      I purr, I only purr for thee!      Thy form is stamp'd upon that heart,      Which, true to thee, will beat till death;    Thy praises, dear one that thou art,      Will mingle with my latest breath."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32522"],[0,"Mr. Spaceship (#5)"],[1,"he had a goat.\" She smiled. \"Do  you remember the day the goat got loose and wandered down the main  street of town? Nobody could figure out where it came from.\"    \"Anything else?\"    \"No.\" He watched her struggling, trying to remember. \"He wanted to  have a farm, sometime, I know.\"    \"All right. Thanks.\" Kramer touched the switch. \"When I get back to  Terra maybe I'll stop and see you.\"    \"Let me know how it works out.\"    He cut the line and the picture dimmed and faded. He walked slowly  back to where Gross and some officers of the Military were sitting at  a chart table, talking.    \"Any luck?\" Gross said, looking up.    \"No. All she remembers is that he kept a goat.\"    \"Come over and look at this detail chart.\" Gross motioned him around  to his side. \"Watch!\"    Kramer saw the record tabs moving furiously, the little white dots  racing back and forth.    \"What's happening?\" he asked.    \"A squadron outside the defense zone has finally managed to contact  the ship. They're maneuvering now, for position. Watch.\"    The white counters were forming a barrel formation around a black dot  that was moving steadily across the board, away from the central  position. As they watched, the white dots constricted around it.    \"They're ready to open fire,\" a technician at the board said.  \"Commander, what shall we tell them to do?\"    Gross hesitated. \"I hate to be the one who makes the decision. When it  comes right down to it--\"    \"It's not just a ship,\" Kramer said. \"It's a man, a living person. A  human being is up there, moving through space. I wish we knew what--\"    \"But the order has to be given. We can't take any chances. Suppose he  went over to them, to the yuks.\"    Kramer's jaw dropped. \"My God, he wouldn't do that.\"    \"Are you sure? Do you know what he'll do?\"    \"He wouldn't do that.\"    Gross turned to the technician. \"Tell them to go ahead.\"    \"I'm sorry, sir, but now the ship has gotten away. Look down at the  board.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Gross stared down, Kramer over his shoulder. The black dot had slipped  through the white dots and had moved off at an abrupt angle. The white  dots were broken up, dispersing in confusion.    \"He's an unusual strategist,\" one of the officers said. He traced the  line. \"It's an ancient maneuver, an old Prussian device, but it  worked.\"    The white dots were turning back. \"Too many yuk ships out that far,\"  Gross said. \"Well, that's what you get when you don't act quickly.\" He  looked up coldly at Kramer. \"We should have done it when we had him.  Look at him go!\" He jabbed a finger at the rapidly moving black dot.  The dot came to the edge of the board and stopped. It had reached the  limit of the chartered area. \"See?\"    --Now what? Kramer thought, watching. So the Old Man had escaped the  cruisers and gotten away. He was alert, all right; there was nothing  wrong with his mind. Or with his ability to control his new body.    Body--The ship was a new body for him. He had traded in the old dying  body, withered and frail, for this hulking frame of metal and plastic,  turbines and rocket jets. He was strong, now. Strong and big. The new  body was more powerful than a thousand human bodies. But how long  would it last him? The average life of a cruiser was only ten years.  With careful handling he might get twenty out of it, before some  essential part failed and there was no way to replace it.    And then, what then? What would he do, when something failed and there  was no one to fix it for him? That would be the end. Someplace, far  out in the cold darkness of space, the ship would slow down, silent  and lifeless, to exhaust its last heat into the eternal timelessness  of outer space. Or perhaps it would crash on some barren asteroid,  burst into a million fragments.    It was only a question of time.    \"Your wife didn't remember anything?\" Gross said.    \"I told you. Only that he kept a goat, once.\"    \"A hell of a lot of help that is.\"    Kramer shrugged. \"It's not my fault.\"    \"I wonder if we'll ever see him again.\" Gross stared down at the  indicator dot, still hanging at the edge of the board. \"I wonder if  he'll ever move back this way.\"    \"I wonder, too,\" Kramer said.           *       *       *       *       *    That night Kramer lay in bed, tossing from side to side, unable to  sleep. The moon gravity, even artificially increased, was unfamiliar  to him and it made him uncomfortable. A thousand thoughts wandered  loose in his head as he lay, fully awake.    What did it all mean? What was the Professor's plan? Maybe they would  never know. Maybe the ship was gone for good; the Old Man had left  forever, shooting into outer space. They might never find out why he  had done it, what purpose--if any--had been in his mind.    Kramer sat up in bed. He turned on the light and lit a cigarette. His  quarters were small, a metal-lined bunk room, part of the moon station  base.    The Old Man had wanted to talk to him. He had wanted to discuss  things, hold a conversation, but in the hysteria and confusion all  they had been able to think of was getting away. The ship was rushing  off with them, carrying them into outer space. Kramer set his jaw.  Could they be blamed for jumping? They had no idea where they were  being taken, or why. They were helpless, caught in their own ship, and  the pursuit ship standing by waiting to pick them up was their only  chance. Another half hour and it would have been too late.    But what had the Old Man wanted to say? What had he intended to tell  him, in those first confusing moments when the ship around them had  come alive, each metal strut and wire suddenly animate, the body of a  living creature, a vast metal organism?    It was weird, unnerving. He could not forget it, even now. He looked  around the small room uneasily. What did it signify, the coming to  life of metal and plastic? All at once they had found themselves  inside a _living_ creature, in its stomach, like Jonah inside the  whale.    It had been alive, and it had talked to them, talked calmly and  rationally, as it rushed them off, faster and faster into outer space.  The wall speaker and circuit had become the vocal cords and mouth, the  wiring the spinal cord and nerves, the hatches and relays and circuit  breakers the muscles.    They had been helpless, completely helpless. The ship had, in a brief  second, stolen their power away from them and left them defenseless,  practically at its mercy. It was not right; it made him uneasy. All  his life he had controlled machines, bent nature and the forces of  nature to man and man's needs. The human race had slowly evolved until  it was in a position to operate things, run them as it saw fit. Now  all at once it had been plunged back down the ladder again, prostrate  before a Power against which they were children.    Kramer got out of bed. He put on his bathrobe and began to search for  a cigarette. While he was searching, the vidphone rang.    He snapped the vidphone on.    \"Yes?\"    The face of the immediate monitor appeared. \"A call from Terra, Mr.  Kramer. An emergency call.\"    \"Emergency call? For me? Put it through.\" Kramer came awake, brushing  his hair back out of his eyes. Alarm plucked at him.    From the speaker a strange voice came. \"Philip Kramer? Is this  Kramer?\"    \"Yes. Go on.\"    \"This is General Hospital, New York City, Terra. Mr. Kramer, your wife  is here. She has been critically injured in an accident. Your name was  given to us to call. Is it possible for you to--\"    \"How badly?\" Kramer gripped the vidphone stand. \"Is it serious?\"    \"Yes, it's serious, Mr. Kramer. Are you able to come here? The quicker  you can come the better.\"    \"Yes.\" Kramer nodded. \"I'll come. Thanks.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The screen died as the connection was broken. Kramer waited a moment.  Then he tapped the button. The screen relit again. \"Yes, sir,\" the  monitor said.    \"Can I get a ship to Terra at once? It's an emergency. My wife--\"    \"There's no ship leaving the moon for eight hours. You'll have to wait  until the next period.\"    \"Isn't there anything I can do?\"    \"We can broadcast a general request to all ships passing through this  area. Sometimes cruisers pass by here returning to Terra for repairs.\"    \"Will you broadcast that for me? I'll come down to the field.\"    \"Yes sir. But there may be no ship in the area for awhile. It's a  gamble.\" The screen died.    Kramer dressed quickly. He put on his coat and hurried to the lift. A  moment later he was running across the general receiving lobby, past  the rows of vacant desks and conference tables. At the door the  sentries stepped aside and he went outside, onto the great concrete  steps.    The face of the moon was in shadow. Below him the field stretched out  in total darkness, a black void, endless, without form. He made his  way carefully down the steps and along the ramp along the side of the  field, to the control tower. A faint row of red lights showed him the  way.    Two soldiers challenged him at the foot of the tower, standing in the  shadows, their guns ready.    \"Kramer?\"    \"Yes.\" A light was flashed in his face.    \"Your call has been sent out already.\"    \"Any luck?\" Kramer asked.    \"There's a cruiser nearby that has made contact with us. It has an  injured jet and is moving slowly back toward Terra, away from the  line.\"    \"Good.\" Kramer nodded, a flood of relief rushing through him. He lit a  cigarette and gave one to each of the soldiers. The soldiers lit up.    \"Sir,\" one of them asked, \"is it true about the experimental ship?\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"It came to life and ran off?\"    \"No, not exactly,\" Kramer said. \"It had a new type of control system  instead of the Johnson units. It wasn't properly tested.\"    \"But sir, one of the cruisers that was there got up close to it, and a  buddy of mine says this ship acted funny. He never saw anything like  it. It was"]]]
