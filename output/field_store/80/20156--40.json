From patterns of bites of venomous snakes, Pope and Perkins  (1944:333-335) attempted to correlate number, size, and patterns of  tooth marks with size and generic identity of the snake responsible for  the bite. Distance between fangs is relatively constant for snakes of a  particular size (Table 6) regardless of genus, but the fangs of a  cottonmouth are directed outward to variable degrees, and puncture  wounds could easily resemble those of a much larger snake (Table 7).  Also there is no direct relationship between size of snake and toxicity  or amount of venom injected. Consequently information of this kind is of  little or no value from a medical standpoint.

Shaded, moist areas either in or beside shallow waters are  preferred, but cottonmouths occasionally wander as far as a mile from  water.    In the pine-oak forests of Nacogdoches County in eastern Texas  cottonmouths and copperheads are probably the most abundant species of  snakes. Specimens have been collected near Nacogdoches in ponds, swamps,  clear and fast-running streams with rock bottoms, and sluggish muddy  streams. On the Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest numerous  cottonmouths live in a swamp until around mid-July, when it becomes dry.  A small stream west of the swamp seems to be used as a migration route  to and from the swamp. Slightly more than a mile downstream cottonmouths  are common in a bottomland area. The ground is always moist and no  undergrowth occurs; a few small clear springs produce shallow trickles  that run into a swamp. Cottonmouths can often be found here, lying in or  beside the small trickles.    I have seen cottonmouths in various types of aquatic habitats in  Brazoria County. In most places in this area, cottonmouths are found in  association with one or more species of water-snakes (including _Natrix  cyclopion_, _N. erythrogaster_, _N. rhombifera_, and _N. confluens_),  which greatly outnumber the cottonmouth. Interspecific competition may  be reduced somewhat by cottonmouths sometimes feeding on water-snakes.    The numerous statements in the literature concerning the habitat of the  cottonmouth can be summarized most easily by the following short  quotations:         _Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus_--\"Marshes and lakes; ponds       and streams with wooded shores; low country near water;       roadside ponds; drainage ditches; coastal 'banks'; keys; some       Gulf coast islands; mangrove swamps.\" (Wright and Wright,       1957:919.)         _Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma_--\"Cypress, gum, river       swamps; alluvial swamps wooded or not wooded; water courses of       the south such as rivers, bayous, backwaters of small branches;       hill streams in the north; ... marshy places in prairies ...       rice fields, bottomland pools; margins of above habitats,       pools, shallow lakes, swampy places, temporary flood lands....       In, under, or on fallen timber, in holes in banks, rocky       bluffs, crayfish burrows. In short it is very aquatic.\" (Wright       and Wright, _op. cit._:923.)    Geographically cottonmouths differ somewhat in their ecological  requirements, but are basically much alike in most respects. The areas  of greatest abundance are those having 40 inches or more of annual  rainfall. The northern edge of the range has a mean temperature of  approximately 38 deg. F. in January in Virginia and 30 deg. F. in Missouri,  although the lowest temperature reached in these areas is more important  as a limiting factor. The annual rainfall in both Virginia and Missouri  amounts to approximately 40 inches. Moisture, as well as temperature,  may play an important role in the northward distribution of the species.  The eastern cottonmouth seems to be less tolerant of low temperatures  than the western subspecies. Mean January temperatures equal to those  along the northern limits of the western cottonmouth's distribution are  reached in the vicinity of Connecticut, which is north of the geographic  range of the eastern subspecies.    The depths to which cottonmouths penetrate into their dens may have a  limiting influence upon the geographic range, especially in the northern  extremes. Bailey (1948:215) discussed the possibility that populations  of snakes may be significantly depressed because of winter kill of  individuals that \"hibernate\" at shallow depths. He speculated also that  the short growing season does not allow enough time for the essentials  of existence to be carried out, and the prolonged period of inactivity  overtaxes the energy reserve of the species.    Available food does not seem to be of much importance as a limiting  factor, for the cottonmouth is remarkably indiscriminate in its choice  of prey, feeding upon almost any vertebrate animal that happens to come  within reach. Competition for food, however, may play an important role.          REPRODUCTION    Courtship and Mating      A review of available literature indicates no records of courtship of  the cottonmouth other than statements that breeding occurs in early  spring. In a close relative, the copperhead (see Fitch, 1960:159-160),  mating occurs almost any time in the season of activity but is mainly  concentrated in the few weeks after spring emergence, at about the time  when females are ovulating. Klauber (1956:692) concluded that along the  southern border of the United States rattlesnakes normally mate in  spring soon after coming out of their winter retreats; but farther north  where broods are produced biennially, the mating times may be more  widely dispersed, and summer and fall matings may even predominate.    The only record of copulation in the cottonmouth was reported by Allen  and Swindell (1948:11), who observed a pair copulating for three hours  on October 19, 1946, at the Ross Allen Reptile Institute. Davis  (1936:267-268) stated that courtship in cottonmouths is violent and  prolonged but did not note any nervous, jerky motions or nudging of the  female along her back and sides as had been observed in other genera of  snakes. Carr (1936:90) saw a male cottonmouth seize a female in his  mouth and hold her, but no courtship followed.      Reproductive Cycles    Many persons have assumed that gestation periods in snakes are the  intervals between mating and parturition, and that mating and ovulation  occur at approximately the same time. However, retention of spermatozoa  and delayed fertilization indicate that copulation is not a stimulus for  ovulation.    A biennial reproductive cycle was found for the copperhead in Kansas  (Fitch, 1960:162), the prairie rattler in Wyoming (Rahn, 1942:239) and  in South Dakota (Klauber, 1956:688), the great basin rattler in Utah  (Glissmeyer, 1951:24), and the western diamondback rattler in  northwestern Texas (Tinkle, 1962:309). Klauber's (1956:687) belief that  the reproductive cycle of rattlesnakes varies with climate, being  biennial in the north and annual in the south, is supported by similar  climatic variation in the reproductive cycle of the European viper which  was discussed by Volsoe (1944:18, 149).    If data for a large number of females were arranged as are those in  Table 8, they might reveal whether the breeding cycle is annual or  biennial. The figures presented in Table 8 are misleading if viewed  separately because of the small number of individuals included in some  of the size classes.    The smallest reproductive female found measured 455 millimeters in  snout-vent length. Conant (1933:43) reported that a female raised in  captivity gave birth to two young at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#5)"],[1,"thus related; this is the case in  the figure (4) given; here the costiform processes of the fourth and  fifth vertebrae articulate, and the two terminal ones have coalesced.    In the ox, the same processes are more developed than in the horse;  their summits elevating the skin, produce, especially in animals which  have not much flesh, prominences which limit the flanks in the superior  aspect. The costiform processes of the last lumbar vertebrae are separate  from each other; those of the latter are not in contact with the sacrum.    =The Sacrum.=[3]--This bone, single and median, is formed by the mutual  coalescence of several vertebrae, which vary in number according to the  species observed.      [3] In human anatomy, the sacrum and the coccyx are studied as part of        the pelvis; we, therefore, in the study of the artistic anatomy of        man, study these bones with the bones of the lower limbs. Here we        do not follow this plan. In animals the sacrum and the coccyx, as        a matter of fact, clearly continue the superior border of the        skeleton of the trunk; hence we study them with the vertebral        column.    _Vertebrae Constituting the Sacrum._--Bears, 5; dogs, 3; cats, 3;  rabbits, 4; swine, 4; horses, 5; camels, 4; oxen, 5; sheep, 4.    The sacrum is situated between the two iliac bones; with which it  articulates, and contributes to the formation of the pelvis. It is  obliquely placed, from before backwards, and from below upwards;  immediately behind the lumbar section of the vertebral column; and is  continued by the coccygeal vertebrae, which form the skeleton of the  tail.    It is triangular in outline, and is generally more narrow in proportion  than in the human being. All things considered, it is more large and  massive, and of greater density, in species which sometimes assume the  upright posture, rather than in those which cannot assume that  attitude; for example, the sacrum of the ape, of the bear, of the dog,  and of the opossum are proportionately larger than those of the  horse.[4]      [4] This is particularly striking only in those portions of the sacrum        that are not in relation with the other bones of the pelvis. We        think that the general form of this bone depends on the mode of        its connexions with the iliac bones and the extent of the        articular surfaces by which it is in contact with the latter.    Its superior surface presents a crest, formed by the fusion of the  spinous processes of the vertebrae which form it. In certain species  these processes are attached only by their bases, and are separated from  each other superiorly. In the pig they are wholly wanting.    =The Coccygeal Vertebrae.=--These vertebrae, few in number (and sometimes  ankylosed) in the human being, form in the latter a small series, the  coccyx; which is inclined forwards, that is to say, towards the interior  of the pelvis. In quadrupeds, on the contrary, their number is large;  they are not ankylosed, and they form the skeleton of the caudal  appendix.    The first coccygeal vertebrae--that is, those which are next the  sacrum--present characters which are common to those of other regions:  they have a body, a foramen, and processes. As we trace them backwards,  these characters become gradually effaced; and they become little more  than small osseous cylinders simply expanded at their extremities.      Direction and Form of the Spinal Column    The curves of the vertebral column are, in quadrupeds, slightly  different from those which characterize the human spine. First, instead  of their being, as in the latter, curves in the antero-posterior aspect,  because of the general attitude of the body, they are turned in the  supero-inferior direction.    The cervical region is not a single curve, as in the human being. It  presents two: one superior, with its convexity looking upwards; the  other inferior, the convexity of which is turned downwards. This  arrangement reminds one of that of a console.    The dorsal and lumbar regions are placed in a single curved line, more  or less concave downwards; so that in the lumbar region there is no  curve analogous to that which exists in man; a form which, in the  latter, is due to the biped attitude--that is to say, the vertical  position of the trunk. Briefly, there is in quadrupeds one dorso-lumbar  curve; and not both a dorsal and a lumbar, with convexities in opposite  directions.    At the extremity of the dorso-lumbar region is the sacrum and the caudal  appendix, which describe a curve of which the concavity is directed  downwards and forwards.    It is necessary to point out that it is not the curves of the three  anterior portions of the spinal column which determine the form of the  superior border of the neck and shoulders, and of the same part of the  trunk. For the first portion, there is a ligament which surmounts the  cervical region, and substitutes its modelling influence for that of the  vertebrae. It is the _superior cervical ligament_, which arises from the  spinous process of the first cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the  external occipital protuberance on the upper part of the posterior  surface of the skull. The summits of the spinous processes of the  vertebrae alone give form to the superior median border of the trunk. In  this connection we here repeat that it is not the general curvature of  the vertebral column which produces the withers, but the great length of  the spinous process of the first vertebrae of the dorsal region.      The Thorax    The dorsal vertebrae form the posterior limit in man, and superior in  quadrupeds, of the region of the trunk known as the _thorax_. A single  bone, the sternum, is situated at the aspect opposite; the ribs bound  the thorax on its sides.    In its general outlines the thorax in quadrupeds resembles that  of man--that is to say, that, as in the latter, the anterior  portion--superior in the human being--is narrower than the part  opposite. But the progressive widening takes place in a more regular and  continuous fashion, so that it presents a more definitely conical  outline. This purely conical form is nevertheless found in the human  species, but only during infancy; the inferior portion of the thoracic  cage being then widely expanded, because of the development of the  abdominal viscera, which at that period are relatively large.    But the proportionate measurements of the thorax are different. Indeed,  we may recall that in man the thorax is flattened from before backwards,  so that the distance between the sternum and the vertebral column is  shorter than the distance from the rib of one side to the corresponding  one of the opposite side (Fig. 5). In animals, on the contrary, it is  flattened laterally. Its vertical diameter--measured from the sternum to  the vertebral column--is greater than the transverse measurement (Fig.  6).    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--A TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE THORAX OF A MAN  PLACED VERTICALLY--THAT IS TO SAY, IN THE DIRECTION WHICH IT WOULD  ASSUME IN A MAN PLACED IN THE ATTITUDE OF A QUADRUPED (A DIAGRAMMATIC  FIGURE).    1, Dorsal vertebra; 2, sternal region; 3, costal region of one side; 3',  costal region of the other side.]    From this results a peculiar arrangement of the muscles that we are able  to bring directly into prominence, which presents points of interest  from the point of view of the contraction of the subcutaneous layer.  Indeed, in man the region occupied by the pectorals is very broad; it is  a wide surface turned directly forward. In quadrupeds, this region of  the pectorals is narrowed. It is not spread out, as in the preceding  instances; and the appearance it presents is explained by the fact that  the thorax is compressed laterally. If we examine the thorax on one of  its lateral surfaces, the muscles, on the contrary, are more extended.  We see the contour of the vertebral column, and the median part of the  abdomen; and, especially in the horse, between the great dorsal and the  great oblique of the abdomen, we find a large space, in which the ribs,  with the intercostals which join them, are uncovered; the muscles in  question separate the one from the other, under the influence, it would  seem, of the great dimensions of the lateral wall of the thorax.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--A VERTICAL SECTION OF THE THORAX OF A QUADRUPED  (DIAGRAMMATIC).    1, Fifth dorsal vertebra; 2, sternal region; 3, costal region of one  side; 3', costal region of the opposite side.]    =The Sternum.=--The sternum is, in quadrupeds, directed obliquely  downwards and backwards; its form varies in different species. In the  carnivora, it consists of eight bones, irregularly cylindrical in form,  being slightly flattened from within outwards, and thickened at their  extremities. They remain separate, and this contributes elasticity and  flexibility to the thorax. The first nine costal cartilages articulate  directly with the sternum. The first of these cartilages articulates  with a nodule situated a little above the middle of the first bone of  the sternum.    In the horse the sternum is flattened laterally in its anterior portion,  and from above downwards in its posterior half. The six bones which  form the sternum are connected by cartilage. The keel-shaped piece,  situated in front of the sternum, is also cartilaginous. This process,  but slightly marked posteriorly, becomes more and more prominent in  front, and terminates at its anterior extremity by a prolongation,  slightly curved backwards, which projects for some centimetres beyond  the cavity in which the first costal cartilage is received. This process  is known as the _tracheal process_, or _rostral cartilage_. The  posterior extremity of the sternum, flattened from above downwards, ends  in a cartilaginous plate; concave superiorly, and convex inferiorly:  this is the abdominal prolongation, or _xiphoid appendix_.
