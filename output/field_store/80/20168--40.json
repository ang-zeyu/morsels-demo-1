They shot  two, and sent some of the meat on board the Adventure. The next day, Mr.  Tarn succeeded in shooting one, a female, which, when skinned and cleaned,  weighed 168 lbs. Narborough mentions having killed one at Port San Julian,  that weighed, \"cleaned in his quarters, 268 lbs.\" The watchful and wary  character of this animal is very remarkable. Whenever a herd is feeding,  one is posted, like a sentinel, on a height; and, at the approach of  danger, gives instant alarm by a loud neigh, when away they all go, at a  hand-gallop, to the next eminence, where they quietly resume their feeding,  {5} until again warned of the approach of danger by their vigilant  'look-out.'    Another peculiarity of the guanaco is, the habit of resorting to particular  spots for natural purposes. This is mentioned in the 'Dictionnaire  d'Histoire Naturelle,' in the 'Encyclopedie Methodique,' as well as other  works.    In one place we found the bones of thirty-one guanacoes collected within a  space of thirty yards, perhaps the result of an encampment of Indians, as  evident traces of them were observed; among which were a human jaw-bone,  and a piece of agate ingeniously chipped into the shape of a spear-head.    The fox, which we did not take, appeared to be small, and similar to a new  species afterwards found by us in the Strait of Magalhaens.    The cavia[5] (or, as it is called by Narborough, Byron, and Wood, the hare,  an animal from which it differs both in appearance and habits, as well as  flavour), makes a good dish; and so does the armadillo, which our people  called the shell-pig.[6] This little animal is found abundantly about the  low land, and lives in burrows underground; several were taken by the  seamen, and, when cooked in their shells, were savoury and wholesome.    Teal were abundant upon the marshy grounds. A few partridges, doves, and  snipes, a rail, and some hawks were shot. The few sea-birds that were  observed consisted of two species of gulls, a grebe and a penguin  (_Aptenodytes Magellanica_).    We found two species of snakes and several kinds of lizards. Fish were  scarce, as were also insects; of the last, our {6} collections consisted  only of a few species of _Coleoptera_, two or three _Lepidoptera_, and two  _Hymenoptera_.    Among the sea-shells, the most abundant was the _Patella deaurata_, Lamk.;  this, with three other species of Patella, one _Chiton_, three species of  _Mytilus_, three of _Murex_, one of _Crepidula_, and a _Venus_, were all  that we collected.    About the country, near the sea-shore, there is a small tree, whose stem  and roots are highly esteemed for fuel by the crews of sealing-vessels  which frequent this coast. They call it 'piccolo.' The leaf was described  to me as having a prickle upon it, and the flower as of a yellow colour. A  species of berberis also is found, which when ripe may afford a very  palatable fruit.    Our short visit gave us no flattering opinion of the fertility of the  country near this port. Of the interior we were ignorant; but, from the  absence of Indians and the scarcity of fresh water, it is probably very  bare of pasturage. Falkner, the Jesuit missionary, says these parts were  used by the Tehuelhet tribes for burying-places: we saw, however, no  graves, nor any traces of bodies, excepting the jaw-bone above-mentioned;  but subsequently, at Sea Bear Bay, we found many places on the summits of  the hills which had evidently been used for such a purpose, although then  containing no remains of bodies. This corresponds with Falkner's account,  that after a period of twelve months the sepulchres are formally visited by  the tribe, when the bones of their relatives and friends are collected and  carried to certain places, where the skeletons are arranged in order, and  tricked out with all the finery and ornaments they can collect.    The ships sailed from Port Santa Elena on the 5th December, and proceeded  to the southward, coasting the shore as far as Cape Two Bays.    Our object being to proceed with all expedition to the Strait of  Magalhaens, the examination of this part of the coast was reserved for a  future opportunity. On the 13th, we had reached within fifty miles of Cape  Virgins, the headland at the entrance of the strait, but it was directly in  the wind's eye {7} of us. The wind veering to S.S.W., we made about a west  course. At day-light the land was in sight, terminating in a point to the  S.W., so exactly like the description of Cape Virgins and the view of it in  Alison's voyage, that without considering our place on the chart, or  calculating the previous twenty-four hours' run, it was taken for the Cape  itself, and, no one suspecting a mistake, thought of verifying the ship's  position. The point, however, proved to be Cape Fairweather. It was not a  little singular, that the same mistake should have been made on board the  Beagle, where the error was not discovered for three days.[7]    From the appearance of the weather I was anxious to approach the land in  order to anchor, as there seemed to be every likelihood of a gale; and we  were not deceived, for at three o'clock, being within seven miles of the  Cape, a strong wind sprung up from the S.W., and the anchor was dropped.  Towards evening it blew so hard, that both ships dragged their anchors for  a considerable distance.    On the charts of this part of the coast the shore is described to be formed  of \"chalk hills, like the coast of Kent.\" To geologists, therefore,  especially, as they were not disposed to believe that such was the fact,  this was a question of some interest. From our anchorage the appearance of  the land favoured our belief of the existence of chalk. The outline was  very level and steep; precipitous cliffs of whitish colour, stratified  horizontally, with their upper part occasionally worn into hollows,  strongly resembled the chalk cliffs of the English coasts.    The gale prevented our landing for three days, when (19th) a few minutes  sufficed to discover that the cliffs were composed {8} of soft clay,  varying in colour and consistence, and disposed in strata running  horizontally for many miles without interruption, excepting where  water-courses had worn them away. Some of the strata were very fine clay,  unmixed with any other substance, whilst others were plentifully strewed  with round siliceous gravel,[8] without any vestige of organic remains. The  sea beach, from high-water mark to the base of the cliffs, is formed by  shingle, with scattered masses of indurated clay of a green colour.[9]  Between the high and low tide marks there is a smooth beach of the same  green clay as the masses above-mentioned, which appears to have been  hardened by the action of the surf to the consistence of stone. Generally  this beach extends for about one hundred yards farther into the sea, and is  succeeded by a soft green mud, over which the water gradually deepens. The  outer edge of the clay forms a ledge, extending parallel with the coast,  upon the whole length of which the sea breaks, and over it a boat can with  difficulty pass at low water.    The very few shells we found were dead. Strewed about the beach were  numbers of fish, some of which had been thrown on shore by the last tide,  and were scarcely stiff. They principally belonged to the genus _Ophidium_;  the largest that we saw measured four feet seven inches in length, and  weighed twenty-four pounds. Many caught alongside the ship were, in truth,  coarse and insipid; yet our people, who fed heartily upon them, called them  ling, and thought them palatable. The hook, however, furnished us with a  very wholesome and well-flavoured species of cod (_Gadus_). Attached to the  first we found two parasitical animals; one was a _Cymothoa_, the other a  species of _Lernaea_, which had so {9} securely attached itself under the  skin, as not to be removed without cutting off a piece of the flesh with  it. An undescribed species of _Muraena_ was also taken.    Whilst we were on shore, the Beagle moved eight or nine miles nearer to the  Cape, where Captain Stokes landed to fix positions of remarkable land. One  peaked hill, from the circumstance of his seeing a large animal near it, he  called Tiger Mount. Mr. Bowen shot a guanaco; and being at a distance in  shore, unable to procure assistance, he skinned and quartered it with his  pocket-knife, and carried it upon his shoulders to the boat.    Next morning the ships weighed, and proceeded towards Cape Virgins.    When a-breast of Cape Fairweather, the opening of the river Gallegos was  very distinctly seen; but the examination of it was deferred to a future  opportunity. Passing onward, the water shoaled to four fathoms, until we  had passed extensive banks, which front the river.    Our approach to the entrance of the Strait, although attended with anxiety,  caused sensations of interest and pleasure not easily to be described.  Though dangers were experienced by some navigators who had passed it, the  comparative facility with which others had effected the passage showed  that, at times, the difficulties were easily surmounted, and we were  willing to suppose that in the former case there might have been some  little exaggeration.    The most complete, and, probably, the only good account of the navigation  of the Strait of Magalhaens is contained in the narrative of Don Antonio de  Cordova, who commanded the Spanish frigate Santa Maria de la Cabeza, on a  voyage expressly for the purpose of exploring the strait. It was published  under the title of 'Ultimo Viage al Estrecho de Magallanes.' That voyage  was, however, concluded with only the examination of the eastern part, and  a subsequent expedition was made, under the command of the same officer,  the account of which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38967"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 4 (of 6) (#5)"],[1,"beautiful boys,  painted in chiaroscuro, and playing amidst luxuriant festoons of flowers.  In the same taste of the Campi he produced several sacred pieces; such as  the picture of S. Michele at Sta. Agnese; the Paradiso at the Orsoline; and  subsequent to Duke Vincenzio, he was employed by his three successors, and  died in Mantua, after having established his family in that city.    Not very long afterwards, Domenico Feti from Rome was declared painter of  the same court, an artist of whose education, received under Cigoli, I have  treated elsewhere. Cardinal Ferdinando, succeeding to the dukedom of  Mantua, had brought him from Rome to his own court, where he had  opportunities of improving himself, by studying the finest Lombard models,  along with several of the Venetians. He produced many pictures in oil, for  various temples and galleries; one of which, representing the  Multiplication of Loaves, exists in the Mantuan academy, abounding with  figures rather truly noble than large; but varied, shortened, and coloured  in a very masterly style. A still more copious work was that in the choir  of the cathedral, though his pieces in fresco, like those of Cigoli, have  less merit than those painted in oil. With all the excellence of his  compositions, he has certainly the fault of being too symmetrical in his  groups, which consequently seem to correspond in an exact order, calculated  in architecture to please both the eye and the mind, but by no means so in  painting. His own youthful excesses deprived Venice of this fine genius,  and distinguished ornament of his art, in the very flower of his age. The  names of other artists likewise engaged in the service of the same court,  where a relish for the fine arts seems to have been almost indigenous, were  Titian, Coreggio, Genga, Tintoretto, Albani, Rubens, Gessi, Gerola,  Vermiglio, Castiglione, Lodovico Bertucci, with others of eminent  abilities; some of whom were invited for particular commissions, and others  permanently engaged for a length of time. Thus the city of Mantua became  one of the most richly ornamented in all Italy; insomuch that after  suffering the sackage of 1630, in which the ducal palace was despoiled of  the noble collection, now dispersed abroad, it still can boast, both in  private and public exhibitions, sufficient to engage the curiosity of  cultivated strangers for a period of many days.    The city in the meanwhile was not deficient in native artists of superior  genius, such as Venusti, Manfredi, and Facchetti; all of whom, on account  of their residence in Rome, we have treated of in that school; while in  that of Parma we shall have occasion to insert the name of Giorgio del  Grano, supposed to be of Mantua, and of Andrea Scutellari in that of  Cremona, in which he became fixed. Francesco Borgani is one of those who  resided in his native place, and who adopted a good style from the  paintings of Parmigianino, in which he composed several pictures in S.  Pietro, in S. Simone, in S. Croce, as well as in other places, by which he  deserves to be better known than he now is. This artist flourished until  the latter half of the past century.    Towards the same period Giovanni Canti, while yet young, came from Parma  and settled in Mantua, an artist whose merits, consisting in his landscapes  and battle-scenes, are to be sought for in galleries of art, not in the  specimens of his altar-pieces in churches, which are very inferior. He was  one of those who lay too much stress on their rapidity of hand.  Schivenoglia, whose proper name was Francesco Ranieri, was one of his  scholars, equally distinguished for his battles as for his landscape;  superior to his master in design, but inferior in point of colouring. Next  to him Giovanni Cadioli was considered a good landscape painter, and better  in fresco than in oils. He wrote an account of the pictures of Mantua, and  at the same period was one of the earliest founders and the first director  of the academy for design at that place.    Giovanni Bazzani, a pupil of Canti, was endowed with a higher genius for  the art than his master, and laid a better foundation for excellence by the  cultivation of his mind, by careful study, and by copying from the most  esteemed models. He more particularly directed his attention towards  Rubens, whose footsteps he diligently pursued to the end of his career. He  was long employed in Mantua and in its adjacent monastery, principally in  works of fresco, displaying an easy, spirited, and imaginative character,  in a manner that does credit to his genius. He was universally allowed to  possess uncommon powers, but being crippled and infirm, he was unable to  exhibit them as he wished; and besides, the rapid manner acquired from  Canti, diminished, for the most part, the value of his works.    Giuseppe Bottani of Cremona, educated at Rome under Masucci, afterwards  established himself in Mantua, where he acquired the reputation of a good  landscape painter in the manner of Poussin, and of a good figurist in that  of Maratta. His best pictures are found beyond the confines of the city; in  a church at Milan, dedicated to Saints Cosma and Damiano, is to be seen a  Santa Paola by his hand, taking farewell of the domestics, a piece by no  means inferior to that of Batoni, which is placed at its side. It had been  well for his reputation as an artist had he always exerted himself with  equal care, for in every composition he might have approved himself an  excellent disciple of the school of Rome. His extreme haste, however,  rendered him inconsistent with himself, so that in the city where he  taught, there can hardly be enumerated one or two specimens among the great  number he produced in public, which can at all vie with the Milanese. The  reader may have already learned, in the course of this work, that of all  faults celerity is one of the most fatal to the reputation of artists; the  rock upon which many of the finest geniuses have struck. To few, indeed,  has it been given to produce with rapidity and to produce well.    The academy of Mantua not only still exists, but has been furnished by the  princes of the house of Austria with splendid rooms, with select casts, and  other advantages for the improvement of youth, so as to render it one of  the finest academies in Italy.[3] There have appeared, under the auspices  of Signor Volta, one of its members, compendious notices of the artists of  Mantua, down from the year 1777; an earnest of a more extended work that we  are in hopes of receiving from his able and accomplished pen. With these  notices, as well as others afforded us in conversation with the same  enlightened scholar, we have been glad to enrich the present chapter. Nor  have we failed to keep in view the two Discourses upon the Letters and the  Arts of Mantua, recited in the academy, and afterwards made public by the  Sig. Abate Bettinelli, in which his character, as a fluent orator, and a  diligent historian, in the various notes he has added, appears to equal  advantage.      Footnote 3: Upon the establishment of the Italian republic,       according to what I have recently heard from the learned P.       Pompilio Pozzetti Scolopio, public librarian at Modena, the       academies were reduced to two; the one in Bologna, the other       in Milan; and in the rest of the cities they continue to       exist as schools of the fine arts. To both of these the       government is extremely favourable, as well as to letters,       both very interesting objects of public education. And now,       by the union of the Venetian states, the academy of Venice       is greatly strengthened and increased, established by decree       of the government in the year 1724.            CHAPTER II.      THE MODENESE SCHOOL.        EPOCH I.         _The Ancients._      The state of Modena, such as it is now reunited under the happy government  of the house of Este, will form the subject of the following chapter; and  no other portion of my work can be pronounced superior in point of interest  to this. Since the feeble attempts of Vedriani, and of other writers, more  eager than sagacious, the pictoric history of the entire dominion has been  recently illustrated, as I observed at the commencement, by a distinguished  historian. I have no further object in view than to adapt it to my usual  method, omitting at the same time a few names, which, either from their  mediocrity, from the loss of their works, or other reasons, cannot be  presumed to be greatly interesting to my readers.    The antiquity of this school may be sought for as far back as 1235, at  least if it may be supposed that Berlingeri of Lucca, certainly the author  of a S. Francesco remaining in the castle of Guiglia, painted in the above  year, likewise produced pupils to the state of Modena, a matter which is  still involved in doubt. There is another sacred figure, also the  production of a Modenese, consisting of the Blessed Virgin, between two  military saints, a picture brought from Prague into the Imperial Gallery at  Vienna. We read inscribed upon it in ancient character the two following  lines:--         Quis opus hoc finxit? Thomas de Mutina pinxit;       Quale vides Lector _Rarisini_ filius auctor;    in which we ought to read _Barisini_, both on account of Sig. Garampi, who  is profoundly skilled in the ancient characters, having thus understood it,  and because this name approaches nearer to those which, though certainly  different, are known to apply to the father of Tommaso, as well in Modena  as in Trevigi. In the former I know not that there now remains any thing of  him but the name; but in the latter is to be seen a very extensive work in  the chapter of the Padri Predicatori. Here are represented the saints and  scholars of the order, and the artist's name also appears with the date of  1352.[4] The design of this piece is tolerably good for those times, as  appears"]]]
