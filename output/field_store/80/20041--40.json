It is, however, as far as I can see, the only course  which _can_ work.\"    \"You--we all--perceive its weaknesses.\" The Faros thought for minutes.  \"You cannot be sure that your Intelligence has located all of the danger  points, and many of them must be so far underground as to be safe from  even our heaviest missiles. We all, including you, believe that the  Psychologist is right in holding that the reaction of the other nations  to such action would be both unfavorable and violent. Your report,  please, Talmonides.\"    \"I have already put my data into the integrator.\" The Psychologist  punched a button and the mechanism began to whir and to click. \"I have  only one new fact of any importance; the name of one of the higher-ups  and its corollary implication that there may be some degree of  cooperation between Norheim and Uighar....\"    He broke off as the machine stopped clicking and ejected its report.    \"Look at that graph--up ten points in seven days!\" Talmonides pointed a  finger. \"The situation is deteriorating faster and faster. The  conclusion is unavoidable--you can see yourselves that this summation  line is fast approaching unity--that the outbreaks will become  uncontrollable in approximately eight days. With one slight  exception--here--you will notice that the lines of organization and  purpose are as random as ever. In spite of this conclusive integration I  would be tempted to believe that this seeming lack of coherence was due  to insufficient data--that back of this whole movement there is a  carefully-set-up and completely-integrated plan--except for the fact  that the factions and the nations are so evenly matched. But the data  are sufficient. It is shown conclusively that no one of the other  nations can possibly win, even by totally destroying Atlantis. They  would merely destroy each other and our entire Civilization. According  to this forecast, in arriving at which the data furnished by our Officer  were prime determinants, that will surely be the outcome unless remedial  measures be taken at once. You are of course sure of your facts,  Artomenes?\"    \"I am sure. But you said you had a name, and that it indicated a  Norheim-Uighar hookup. What is that name?\"    \"An old friend of yours....\"    \"Lo Sung!\" The words as spoken were a curse of fury.    \"None other. And, unfortunately, there is as yet no course of action  indicated which is at all promising of success.\"    \"Use mine, then!\" Artomenes jumped up and banged the table with his  fist. \"Let me send two flights of rockets over right now that will blow  Uigharstoy and Norgrad into radioactive dust and make a thousand square  miles around each of them uninhabitable for ten thousand years! If  that's the only way they can learn anything, let them learn!\"    \"Sit down, Officer,\" Ariponides directed, quietly. \"That course, as you  have already pointed out, is indefensible. It violates every Prime Basic  of our Civilization. Moreover, it would be entirely futile, since this  resultant makes it clear that every nation on Earth would be destroyed  within the day.\"    \"What, then?\" Artomenes demanded, bitterly. \"Sit still here and let them  annihilate us?\"    \"Not necessarily. It is to formulate plans that we are here. Talmonides  will by now have decided, upon the basis of our pooled knowledge, what  must be done.\"    \"The outlook is not good: not good at all,\" the Psychologist announced,  gloomily. \"The only course of action which carries any promise whatever  of success--and its probability is only point one eight--is the one  recommended by the Faros, modified slightly to include Artomenes'  suggestion of sending his best operative on the indicated mission. For  highest morale, by the way, the Faros should also interview this agent  before he sets out. Ordinarily I would not advocate a course of action  having so little likelihood of success; but since it is simply a  continuation and intensification of what we are already doing, I do not  see how we can adopt any other.\"    \"Are we agreed?\" Ariponides asked, after a short silence.    They were agreed. Four of the conferees filed out and a brisk young man  strode in. Although he did not look at the Faros his eyes asked  questions.    \"Reporting for orders, sir.\" He saluted the Officer punctiliously.    \"At ease, sir.\" Artomenes returned the salute. \"You were called here for  a word from the Faros. Sir, I present Captain Phryges.\"    \"Not orders, son ... no.\" Ariponides' right hand rested in greeting upon  the captain's left shoulder, wise old eyes probed deeply into  gold-flecked, tawny eyes of youth; the Faros saw, without really  noticing, a flaming thatch of red-bronze-auburn hair. \"I asked you here  to wish you well; not only for myself, but for all our nation and  perhaps for our entire race. While everything in my being rebels against  an unprovoked and unannounced assault, we may be compelled to choose  between our Officer's plan of campaign and the destruction of  Civilization. Since you already know the vital importance of your  mission, I need not enlarge upon it. But I want you to know fully,  Captain Phryges, that all Atlantis flies with you this night.\"    \"Th ... thank you, sir.\" Phryges gulped twice to steady his voice. \"I'll  do my best, sir.\"    And later, in a wingless craft flying toward the airfield, young Phryges  broke a long silence. \"So _that_ is the Faros ... I like him, Officer  ... I have never seen him close up before ... there's something about  him.... He isn't like my father, much, but it seems as though I have  known him for a thousand years!\"    \"Hm ... m ... m. Peculiar. You two are a lot alike, at that, even though  you don't look anything like each other. ... Can't put a finger on  exactly what it is, but it's there.\" Although Artomenes nor any other of  his time could place it, the resemblance was indeed there. It was in and  back of the eyes; it was the \"look of eagles\" which was long later to  become associated with the wearers of Arisia's Lens. \"But here we are,  and your ship's ready. Luck, son.\"    \"Thanks, sir. But one more thing. If it should--if I don't get  back--will you see that my wife and the baby are...?\"    \"I will, son. They will leave for North Maya tomorrow morning. They will  live, whether you and I do or not. Anything else?\"    \"No, sir. Thanks. Goodbye.\"    The ship was a tremendous flying wing. A standard commercial job.  Empty--passengers, even crewmen, were never subjected to the brutal  accelerations regularly used by unmanned carriers. Phryges scanned the  panel. Tiny motors were pulling tapes through the controllers. Every  light showed green. Everything was set. Donning a water-proof coverall,  he slid through a flexible valve into his acceleration-tank and waited.    A siren yelled briefly. Black night turned blinding white as the  harnessed energies of the atom were released. For five and six-tenths  seconds the sharp, hard, beryllium-bronze leading edge of the  back-sweeping V sliced its way through ever-thinning air.    The vessel seemed to pause momentarily; paused and bucked viciously. She  shuddered and shivered, tried to tear herself into shreds and chunks;  but Phryges in his tank was unconcerned. Earlier, weaker ships went to  pieces against the solid-seeming wall of atmospheric incompressibility  at the velocity of sound; but this one was built solidly enough, and  powered to hit that wall hard enough, to go through unharmed.    The hellish vibration ceased; the fantastic violence of the drive  subsided to a mere shove; Phryges knew that the vessel had leveled off  at its cruising speed of two thousand miles per hour. He emerged,  spilling the least possible amount of water upon the polished steel  floor. He took off his coverall and stuffed it back through the valve  into the tank. He mopped and polished the floor with towels, which  likewise went into the tank.    He drew on a pair of soft gloves and, by manual control, jettisoned the  acceleration tank and all the apparatus which had made that unloading  possible. This junk would fall into the ocean; would sink; would never  be found. He examined the compartment and the hatch minutely. No  scratches, no scars, no mars; no tell-tale marks or prints of any kind.  Let the Norskies search. So far, so good.    Back toward the trailing edge then, to a small escape-hatch beside which  was fastened a dull black ball. The anchoring devices went out first. He  gasped as the air rushed out into near-vacuum, but he had been trained  to take sudden and violent fluctuations in pressure. He rolled the ball  out upon the hatch, where he opened it; two hinged hemispheres, each  heavily padded with molded composition resembling sponge rubber. It  seemed incredible that a man as big as Phryges, especially when wearing  a parachute, could be crammed into a space so small; but that lining had  been molded to fit.    This ball _had_ to be small. The ship, even though it was on a  regularly-scheduled commercial flight, would be scanned intensively and  continuously from the moment of entering Norheiman radar range. Since  the ball would be invisible on any radar screen, no suspicion would be  aroused; particularly since--as far as Atlantean Intelligence had been  able to discover--the Norheimans had not yet succeeded in perfecting any  device by the use of which a living man could bail out of a super-sonic  plane.    Phryges waited--and waited--until the second hand of his watch marked  the arrival of zero time. He curled up into one half of the ball; the  other half closed over him and locked. The hatch opened. Ball and  closely-prisoned man plummeted downward; slowing abruptly, with a  horrible deceleration, to terminal velocity. Had the air been any trifle  thicker the Atlantean captain would have died then and there; but that,  too, had been computed accurately and Phryges lived.    And as the ball bulleted downward on a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3284"],[0,"The Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#5)"],[1,"once, I would return to Zanzibar at the end of the  year, March to Kaze again, and make the necessary investigations of the  Victoria lake. Although, in addition to the journey to the source of the  river, I also proposed spending three years in the country, looking  up tributaries, inspecting watersheds, navigating the lake, and making  collections on all branches of natural history, yet L5000 was thought by  the Geographical Society too large a sum to expect from the Government;  so I accepted the half, saying that, whatever the expedition might  cost, I would make good the rest, as, under any circumstances, I would  complete what I had begun, or die in the attempt.    My motive for deferring the journey a year was the hope that I might, in  the meanwhile, send on fifty men, carrying beads and brass wire, under  charge of Arab ivory-traders, to Karague, and fifty men more, in the  same way, to Kaze; whilst I, arriving in the best season for travelling  (May, June, or July), would be able to push on expeditiously to my  depots so formed, and thus escape the great disadvantages of travelling  with a large caravan in a country where no laws prevail to protect one  against desertions and theft. Moreover, I knew that the negroes who  would have to go with me, as long as they believed I had property in  advance, would work up to it willingly, as they would be the gainers  by doing so; whilst, with nothing before them, they would be always  endeavouring to thwart my advance, to save them from a trouble which  their natural laziness would prompt them to escape from.    This beautiful project, I am sorry to say, was doomed from the first;  for I did not get the L2500 grant of money or appointment to the command  until fully nine months had elapsed, when I wrote to Colonel Rigby, our  Consul at Zanzibar, to send on the first instalment of property towards  the interior.    As time then advanced, the Indian branch of the Government very  graciously gave me fifty artillery carbines, with belts and  sword-bayonets attached, and 20,000 rounds of ball ammunition. They lent  me as many surveying instruments as I wanted; and, through Sir George  Clerk, put at my disposal some rich presents, in gold watches, for the  chief Arabs who had so generously assisted us in the last expedition.  Captain Grant, hearing that I was bound on this journey, being an old  friend and brother sportsman in India, asked me to take him with me,  and his appointment was settled by Colonel Sykes, then chairman of a  committee of the Royal Geographical Society, who said it would only be  \"a matter of charity\" to allow me a companion.    Much at the same time, Mr Petherick, an ivory merchant, who had spent  many years on the Nile, arrived in England, and gratuitously offered, as  it would not interfere with his trade, to place boats at Gondokoro,  and send a party of men up the White River to collect ivory in the  meanwhile, and eventually to assist me in coming down. Mr Petherick, I  may add, showed great zeal for geographical exploits, so, as I could not  get money enough to do all that I wished to accomplish myself, I drew  out a project for him to ascend the stream now known as the Usua river  (reported to be the larger branch of the Nile), and, if possible,  ascertain what connection it had with my lake. This being agreed to, I  did my best, through the medium of Earl de Grey (then President of the  Royal Geographical Society), to advance him money to carry out this  desirable object.    The last difficulty I had now before me was to obtain a passage to  Zanzibar. The Indian Government had promised me a vessel of war to  convey me from Aden to Zanzibar, provided it did not interfere with the  public interests. This doubtful proviso induced me to apply to Captain  Playfair, Assistant-Political at Aden, to know what Government vessel  would be available; and should there be none, to get for me a passage by  some American trader. The China war, he assured me, had taken up all the  Government vessels, and there appeared no hope left for me that season,  as the last American trader was just then leaving for Zanzibar. In this  dilemma it appeared that I must inevitably lose the travelling season,  and come in for the droughts and famines. The tide, however, turned in  my favour a little; for I obtained, by permission of the Admiralty, a  passage in the British screw steam-frigate Forte, under orders to convey  Admiral Sir H. Keppel to his command at the Cape; and Sir Charles Wood  most obligingly made a request that I should be forwarded thence  to Zanzibar in one of our slaver-hunting cruisers by the earliest  opportunity.    On the 27th April, Captain Grant and I embarked on board the new  steam-frigate Forte, commanded by Captain E. W. Turnour, at Portsmouth;  and after a long voyage, touching at Madeira and Rio de Janeiro, we  arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on the 4th July. Here Sir George Grey,  the Governor of the colony, who took a warm and enlightened interest in  the cause of the expedition, invited both Grant and myself to reside at  his house. Sir George had been an old explorer himself--was once wounded  by savages in Australia, much in the same manner as I had been in the  Somali country--and, with a spirit of sympathy, he called me his son,  and said he hoped I would succeed. Then, thinking how best he could  serve me, he induced the Cape Parliament to advance to the expedition  a sum of L300, for the purpose of buying baggage-mules; and induced  Lieut.-General Wynyard, the Commander-in-Chief, to detach ten volunteers  from the Cape Mounted Rifle Corps to accompany me. When this addition  was made to my force, of twelve mules and ten Hottentots, the Admiral of  the station placed the screw steam-corvette Brisk at my disposal, and we  all sailed for Zanzibar on the 16th July, under the command of Captain  A. F. de Horsey--the Admiral himself accompanying us, on one of his  annual inspections to visit the east coast of Africa and the Mauritius.  In five days more we touched at East London, and, thence proceeding  north, made a short stay at Delagoa Bay, where I first became acquainted  with the Zulu Kafirs, a naked set of negroes, whose national costume  principally consists in having their hair trussed up like a hoop on the  top of the head, and an appendage like a thimble, to which they attach  a mysterious importance. They wear additional ornaments, charms, &c., of  birds' claws, hoofs and horns of wild animals tied on with strings, and  sometimes an article like a kilt, made of loose strips of skin, or the  entire skins of vermin strung close together. These things I have merely  noticed in passing, because I shall hereafter have occasion to allude  to a migratory people, the Watuta, who dressing much in the same manner,  extend from Lake N'yassa to Uzinza, and may originally have been a part  of this same Kafir race, who are themselves supposed to have migrated  from the regions at present occupied by the Gallas. Next day (the  28th) we went on to Europa, a small island of coralline, covered with  salsolacious shrubs, and tenanted only by sea-birds, owls, finches,  rats, and turtles. Of the last we succeeded in turning three, the  average weight of each being 360 lb., and we took large numbers of their  eggs.    We then went to Mozambique, and visited the Portuguese Governor, John  Travers de Almeida, who showed considerable interest in the prospects  of the expedition, and regretted that, as it cost so much money to visit  the interior from that place, his officers were unable to go there.  One experimental trip only had been accomplished by Mr Soares, who was  forced to pay the Makua chiefs 120 dollars footing, to reach a small  hill in view of the sea, about twenty-five miles off.    Leaving Mozambique on the 9th August, bound for Johanna, we came the  next day, at 11.30 A.M., in sight of a slaver, ship-rigged, bearing on  us full sail, but so distant from us that her mast-tops were only just  visible. As quick as ourselves, she saw who we were and tried to escape  by retreating. This manoeuvre left no doubt what she was, and the Brisk,  all full of excitement, gave chase at full speed, and in four hours more  drew abreast of her. A great commotion ensued on board the slaver. The  sea-pirates threw overboard their colours, bags, and numerous boxes,  but would not heave-to, although repeatedly challenged, until a gun was  fired across her bows. Our boats were then lowered, and in a few minutes  more the \"prize\" was taken, by her crew being exchanged for some of our  men, and we learnt all about her from accurate reports furnished by Mr  Frere, the Cape Slave Commissioner. Cleared from Havannah as \"the Sunny  South,\" professing to be destined for Hong-Kong, she changed her name to  the Manuela, and came slave-hunting in these regions. The slaver's crew  consisted of a captain, doctor, and several sailors, mostly Spaniards.  The vessel was well stored with provisions and medicines; but there  was scarcely enough room in her, though she was said to be only half  freighted, for the 544 creatures they were transporting. The next  morning, as we entered Pamoni harbour by an intricate approach to  the rich little island hill Johanna, the slaver, as she followed us,  stranded, and for a while caused considerable alarm to everybody but her  late captain. He thought his luck very bad, after escaping so often, to  be taken thus; for his vessel's power of sailing were so good, that, had  she had the wind in her favour, the Brisk, even with the assistance of  steam, could not have come up with her. On going on board her, I found  the slaves to be mostly Wahiyow. A few of them were old women, but  all the rest children. They had been captured during wars in their own  country, and sold to Arabs, who brought them to the coast, and kept them  half-starved until the slaver arrived, when they were shipped in dhows  and brought off to the"]]]
