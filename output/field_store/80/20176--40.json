Chapter XXI - Adam and Eve attempt suicide.    1 Then Adam and Eve went in search of the garden.    2 And the heat beat like a flame on their faces; and they sweated from  the heat, and cried before the Lord.    3 But the place where they cried was close to a high mountain, facing  the western gate of the garden.    4 Then Adam threw himself down from the top of that mountain; his face  was torn and his flesh was ripped; he lost a lot of blood and was close  to death.    5 Meanwhile Eve remained standing on the mountain crying over him, thus  lying.    6 And she said, \"I don't wish to live after him; for all that he did to  himself was through me.\"    7 Then she threw herself after him; and was torn and ripped by stones;  and remained lying as dead.    8 But the merciful God, who looks over His creatures, looked at Adam  and Eve as they lay dead, and He sent His Word to them, and raised them.    9 And said to Adam, \"O Adam, all this misery which you have brought on  yourself, will have no affect against My rule, neither will it alter  the covenant of the 5, 500 years.\"          Chapter XXII - Adam in a gracious mood.    1 Then Adam said to God, \"I dry up in the heat, I am faint from  walking, and I don't want to be in this world.  And I don't know when  You will take me out of it to rest.\"    2 Then the Lord God said to him, \"O Adam, it cannot be now, not until  you have ended your days.  Then shall I bring you out of this miserable  land.\"    3 And Adam said to God, \"While I was in the garden I knew neither heat,  nor languor, neither moving about, nor trembling, nor fear; but now  since I came to this land, all this affliction has come over me.    4 Then God said to Adam, \"So long as you were keeping My commandment,  My light and My grace rested on you.  But when you transgressed My  commandment, sorrow and misery came to you in this land.\"    5 And Adam cried and said, \"O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither  punish me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; for  we, of our own will, transgressed Your commandment, and ignored Your  law, and tried to become gods like you, when Satan the enemy deceived  us.\"    6 Then God said again to Adam, \"Because you have endured fear and  trembling in this land, languor and suffering, treading and walking  about, going on this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this  on Myself in order to save you.\"          Chapter XXIII - Adam and Eve strengthen themselves and make the first  altar ever built.    1 Then Adam cried more and said, \"O God, have mercy on me, so far as to  take on yourself, that which I will do.\"    2 But God withdrew His Word from Adam and Eve.    3 Then Adam and Eve stood on their feet; and Adam said to Eve,  \"Strengthen yourself, and I also will strengthen myself.\" And she  strengthened herself, as Adam told her.    4 Then Adam and Eve took stones and placed them in the shape of an  altar; and they took leaves from the trees outside the garden, with  which they wiped, from the face of the rock, the blood they had spilled.    5 But that which had dropped on the sand, they took together with the  dust with which it was mingled and offered it on the altar as an  offering to God.    6 Then Adam and Eve stood under the Altar and cried, thus praying to  God, \"Forgive us our trespass* and our sin, and look at us with Thine  eye of mercy.  For when we were in the garden our praises and our hymns  went up before you without ceasing.    7 But when we came into this strange land, pure praise was not longer  ours, nor righteous prayer, nor understanding hearts, nor sweet  thoughts, nor just counsels, nor long discernment, nor upright  feelings, neither is our bright nature left us.  But our body is  changed from the likeness in which it was at first, when we were  created.    8 Yet now look at our blood which is offered on these stones, and  accept it at our hands, like the praise we used to sing to you at  first, when in the garden.\"    9 And Adam began to make more requests of God.      * ORIGINAL OF THE LORD'S PRAYER SAID TO BE USED ABOUT 150 YEARS BEFORE  OUR LORD: Our Father, Who art in Heaven, be gracious unto us, O Lord  our God, hallowed be Your Name, and let the remembrance of Thee be  glorified Heaven above and upon earth here below.    Let Your kingdom reign over us now and forever.  The Holy Men of old  said remit and forgive unto all men whatsoever they have done unto me.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil thing;  for Thine is the kingdom and Thou shalt reign in glory forever and  forevermore, AMEN.          Chapter XXIV - A vivid prophecy of the life and death of Christ.    1 Then the merciful God, good and lover of men, looked at Adam and Eve,  and at their blood, which they had held up as an offering to Him;  without an order from Him for so doing.  But He wondered at them; and  accepted their offerings.    2 And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their  offering.    3 He smelled the sweet savor of their offering, and showed them mercy.    4 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, as you  have shed your blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh  of your descendants; and as you died, O Adam, so also will I die.  And  as you built an altar, so also will I make for you an altar of the  earth; and as you offered your blood on it, so also will I offer My  blood on an altar on the earth.    5 And as you sued for forgiveness through that blood, so also will I  make My blood forgiveness of sins, and erase transgressions in it.    6 And now, behold, I have accepted your offering, O Adam, but the days  of the covenant in which I have bound you are not fulfilled.  When they  are fulfilled, then will I bring you back into the garden.    7 Now, therefore, strengthen your heart; and when sorrow comes over  you, make Me an offering, and I will be favorable to you.\"          Chapter XXV - God represented as merciful and loving.  The establishing  of worship.    1 But God knew that Adam believed he should frequently kill himself and  make an offering to Him of his blood.    2 Therefore He said to him, \"O Adam, don't ever kill yourself like this  again, by throwing yourself down from that mountain.\"    3 But Adam said to God, \"I was thinking to put an end to myself at  once, for having transgressed Your commandments, and for my having come  out of the beautiful garden; and for the bright light of which You have  deprived me; and for the praises which poured forth from my mouth  without ceasing, and for the light that covered me.    4 Yet of Your goodness, O God, do not get rid of me altogether; but be  favorable to me every time I die, and bring me to life.    5 And thereby it will be made known that You are a merciful God, who  does not want anyone to perish; who loves not that one should fall; and  who does not condemn any one cruelly, badly, and by whole destruction.\"    6 Then Adam remained silent.    7 And the Word of God came to him, and blessed him, and comforted him,  and covenanted with him, that He would save him at the end of the days  determined for him.    8 This, then, was the first offering Adam made to God; and so it became  his custom to do.          Chapter XXVI - A beautiful prophecy of eternal life and joy (v. 15).  The fall of night.    1 Then Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures  where they lived.  But when they got closer to it and saw it from a  distance, heavy sorrow fell on Adam and Eve when they looked at it.    2 Then Adam said to Eve, \"When we were on the mountain we were  comforted by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that  came from the east shown over us.    3 But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shown  over us is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come  over us.    4 And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, in which  darkness covers us, so that we are separated from each other; and you  can not see me, neither can I see you.\"    5 When Adam had said these words, they cried and spread their hands  before God; for they were full of sorrow.    6 And they prayed to God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so  that darkness would not return to them, and that they wouldn't have to  go under this covering of rock.  And they wished to die rather than see  the darkness.    7 Then God looked at Adam and Eve and at their great sorrow, and at all  they had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they  were in, instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the  misery that came over them in a strange land.    8 Therefore God was not angry with them; nor impatient with them; but  he was patient and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He  had created.    9 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"Adam, as for the  sun, if I were to take it and bring it to you, days, hours, years and  months would all stop, and the covenant I have made with you, would  never be fulfilled.    10 But then you would be deserted and stuck in a perpetual plague, and  you would never be saved.    11 Yes, rather, bear long and calm your soul while you live night and  day; until the fulfillment of the days, and the time of My covenant is  come.    12 Then shall I come and save you, O Adam, for I do not wish that you  be afflicted.    13 And when I look at all the good things in which you lived, and why  you came out of them, then would I willingly show you mercy.    14 But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth;  otherwise I would have brought you back into the garden.    15 When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show you and  your descendants mercy, and bring you into a land of gladness, where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#5)"],[1,"a  better taste into Bologna, besides affording an occasion for the grand  genius of Francia to develop itself likewise in the art of painting, as we  shall proceed to shew.    This artist, whose real name was Francesco Raibolini, _was_, according to  Malvasia, _esteemed and celebrated as the first man of that age_; and he  might have added, _in Bologna_, where many so considered him; being there,  as is attested by Vasari, _held in the estimation of a god_. The truth is,  that he had a consummate genius for working in gold; on which account the  medals and coins taken with his moulds rivalled those of Caradosso, the  Milanese; and he was also an excellent painter, in that style which is  termed modern antique, as may be gathered from a great number of  collections, where his Madonnas rank at the side of those of Pietro  Perugino and Gian Bellini. Raffaello, too, compares him with them, and even  greater artists, in a letter dated 1508, edited by Malvasia, in which he  praises his Madonnas, \"never having beheld any more beautiful, more  devotional in their expression, and more finely composed by any artist.\"  His manner is nearly between that of these two heads of their schools, and  participates in the excellence of both; it boasts Perugino's choiceness and  tone of colours; while, in the fulness of its outlines, in the skill of the  folding, and ample flow of the draperies, it bears greater resemblance to  Bellini. His heads, however, do not equal the grace and sweetness of the  former; though he is more dignified and varied than the latter. In the  accessories of his landscapes he rivals both; but in landscape itself, and  in the splendor of his architecture, he is inferior to them. In the  composition of his pictures he is less fond of placing the divine infant in  the bosom of the Virgin than upon a distinct ground, in the ancient manner  of his school; and he sometimes adds to them some half figures of saints,  as was customary with the Venetians of that period. On the whole, however,  he approaches nearer to the Roman School; and, not unfrequently, as is  noticed by Malvasia, his Madonnas have been ascribed by less expert judges  to Pietro Perugino. He likewise produced works in fresco at Bologna,  commended by Vasari; and both there and elsewhere are many of his  altar-pieces yet remaining, displaying figures of larger dimensions than  those usually painted by Bellini and Perugino; the peculiar merit of the  Bolognese School, and by degrees extended to others, augmenting at once the  grandeur of painting and of the temples it adorned.    But the chief praise due to him yet remains to be recorded, and this is,  that he did not begin to exercise his pencil until he had arrived at  manhood, and, in the course of a few years, displayed the rare example of  becoming a scholar and a master, able to compete with the best artists of  Ferrara and Modena. These, as we have mentioned, were invited by Gio.  Bentivoglio, in order to decorate his palace. There, too, Francia was  employed; and he was afterwards commissioned to paint the altar-piece of  the Bentivogli chapel, in 1490, where he signed himself _Franciscus Francia  Aurifex_, as much as to imply that he belonged to the goldsmith's art, not  to that of painting. Nevertheless, that work is a beautiful specimen,  displaying the most finished delicacy of art in every individual figure and  ornament, especially in the arabesque pilasters, in the Mantegna manner. In  process of time he enlarged his style; a circumstance that induced  historians to make a distinction between his first and second manner.  Cavazzoni, who wrote respecting the Madonnas of Bologna, wishes to persuade  us that Raffaello himself had availed himself of Francia's models, in order  to dilate that dry manner which he imbibed from Perugino. We shall award  this glory to the genius of Raffaello, whose youthful performances at San  Severo of Perugia, display a greater degree of softness than those of his  master and of Francia; and after his genius, to the examples of F.  Bartolommeo della Porta, and of Michelangiolo; leaving, we fear, no room to  include the name of Francia. When Raffaello, at Rome, was regarded rather  in the light of an angel than a man, and had already executed some works at  Bologna, he began a correspondence with Francia, urged to it by his  letters; Raffaello became his friend; and, on sending to Bologna his  picture of S. Cecilia, he intreated him, on discovering any error in it, to  correct it; an instance of modesty in our Apelles, more to be admired even  than his paintings. This occurred in 1518, in which year Vasari closes his  life of Francia, who he declares died with excess of passion, on first  beholding that grand performance. Malvasia, however, refutes him, by  proving Francia to \"have lived many years afterwards, and when aged and  declining, even to have changed his manner;\" and in what way, except upon  the models of Raffaello? In his new manner he painted and exhibited, in a  chamber of the Mint, his celebrated piece of S. Sebastian, which, according  to a tradition handed from the Caracci to Albano, and from the latter to  Malvasia, served as a studio for the Bolognese pupils, who copied its  proportions with as much zeal as the ancients would have done those of a  statue of Polycletes, or the moderns of the Apollo, or of the supposed  Antinous of Belvidere. Albani has added that Francia, on perceiving the  concourse of people increase round his picture, and diminish round the St.  Cecilia of Raffaello, then dead, apprehensive lest they should suspect him  of having executed and exhibited his own in competition with such an  artist, instantly removed and placed it in the church of the Misericordia,  where, at this time, there remains a copy of it. The precise year of his  decease, hitherto unknown, has been communicated to me by the Sig. Cav.  Ratti, who found on an ancient drawing of a female saint, now in possession  of Sig. Tommaso Bernardi, a noble of Lucca, a memorandum of this event  having occurred on the seventh day of April, 1533.    Francia, in addition to his cousin Giulio, who devoted himself but little  to painting, gave instructions in the art to his own son of the name of  Giacomo. It is often doubtful, as we find in the Gallery of the princes  Giustiniani, whether such a Madonna is by the hand of Francesco Francia, or  by that of his son, who, in similar pictures imitated closely his father's  style, although, in Malvasia's judgment, he never equalled it. In works on  a larger scale too, he is sometimes to be pronounced inferior, in  comparison with his father, as in S. Vitale, at Bologna, where Francesco  painted the cherubs round a Madonna, in his first manner, somewhat meagre,  perhaps, but still beautiful and full of animated movements, while Giacomo  drew the figures, representing a Nativity of our Lord, more soft in point  of design, but with features less beautiful, and in attitudes and  expressions bordering on extravagance. At other times, the son seems to  have surpassed the father, as at S. Giovanni, of Parma, where there is no  artist who would not wish to have produced that fine picture by Giacomo,  marked with the year 1519, rather than the Deposition from the Cross, by  Francesco. Elsewhere too, as in the picture of S. Giorgio, at the church of  San Francesco in Bologna, he rivals, perhaps, the finest works by his  father; insomuch that this specimen was ascribed to the latter, until there  was recently noticed the signature I., (meaning _Jacobus_) _Francia_, 1526.  He appears, from the first, to have practised a design approaching that of  the moderns; neither have I observed in his paintings such splendid  gildings, nor such meagre arms, as for some time distinguished the elder  Francia. He rather, in progress of time, continued to acquire a more free  and easy manner, insomuch that a few of his Madonnas were more than once  copied and engraved by Agostino Caracci. His heads were extremely animated,  though generally less select, less studied, and less beautiful, than his  father's. He had a son, named Giambatista, by whom there remains, at S.  Rocco, an altar-piece, and a few other specimens, displaying mere  mediocrity.    Among the foreign pupils of Francia, the Bolognese enumerated Lorenzo  Costa, and, indeed, he thus ranks himself, by inscribing under the portrait  of Gio. Bentivoglio, _L. Costa Franciae discipulus_. True it is, that such  inscriptions, as I have frequently found, might come from another hand; or  that, granting he wrote it, he may have done so more out of regard to such  a man, than for the sake of acquainting the world, as Malvasia contends,  that he had been his sole master. Vasari is of a different opinion,  introducing him to us at Bologna as an established artist, already employed  in several considerable cities, and bestowing the highest eulogium on his  earliest production, the S. Sebastiano at the church of S. Petronio,  declaring it the best specimen in water-colours that had, till then, been  seen in the city. Add to this, that Francia exhibited his first altar-piece  in the Bentivogli chapel in 1490, a few years after he had devoted himself  to the art; and there Costa placed the two lateral pictures, tolerably  excellent in point of composition, and filled with those very spirited  portraits of his in 1488. Now had he boasted only Francia for his master,  of what rapid improvement must we suppose him to have been capable!  Besides, would not his style almost invariably resemble that of Francia, at  least in the works he produced at Bologna? Yet the contrary is the case;  and from his less free, and sometimes ill drawn figures; from the coarser  expression of his countenances, his more hard and dull colouring, and his  abundance of architecture, with the taste shewn in his perspective, it is  evident he must have studied elsewhere. Still I believe that he received  the"]]]
