The wind blew fair and strong from the north, and we  flew towards the south against the stream, watching those mysterious  waters with a firm resolve to track them to their distant fountain.    On arrival at Korosko, in Lat. 22 degrees 44 minutes, in twenty-six days  from Cairo, we started across the Nubian desert, thus cutting off the  western bend of the Nile, and in seven days' forced camel march we again  reached the river Abou Hamed. The journey through that desert is most  fatiguing, as the march averages fifteen hours a day through a  wilderness of scorching sand and glowing basalt rocks. The simoom was in  full force at that season (May), and the thermometer, placed in the  shade by the water skins, stood at 114 degrees Fahrenheit.    No drinkable water was procurable on the route; thus our supply was  nearly expended upon reaching the welcome Nile. After eight days' march  on the margin of the river from Abou Hamed through desert, but in view  of the palm trees that bordered the river, we arrived at Berber, a  considerable town in lat. 17 degrees 58 minutes on the banks of the  Nile.    Berber is eight days' camel march from Khartoum (at the junction of the  White and Blue Niles, in lat. 15 degrees 30 minutes), and is the regular  caravan route between that town and Cairo.    From the slight experience I had gained in the journey to Berber, I felt  convinced that success in my Nile expedition would be impossible without  a knowledge of Arabic. My dragoman had me completely in his power, and I  resolved to become independent of all interpreters as soon as possible.  I therefore arranged a plan of exploration for the first year, to  embrace the affluents to the Nile from the Abyssinian range of  mountains, intending to follow up the Atbara river from its junction  with the Nile in lat. 17 degrees 37 minutes (twenty miles south of  Berber), and to examine all the Nile tributaries from the southeast as  far as the Blue Nile, which river I hoped ultimately to descend to  Khartoum. I imagined that twelve months would be sufficient to complete  such an exploration, by which time I should have gained a sufficient  knowledge of Arabic to enable me to start from Khartoum for my White  Nile expedition. Accordingly I left Berber on the 11th June, 1861, and  arrived at the Atbara junction with the Nile on the 13th.    There is no portion of the Nile so great in its volume as that part  situated at the Atbara junction. The river Atbara is about 450 yards in  average width, and from twenty-five to thirty feet deep during the rainy  season. It brings down the entire drainage of Eastern Abyssinia,  receiving as affluents into its main stream the great rivers Taccazy (or  Settite), in addition to the Salaam and Angrab. The junction of the  Atbara in lat. 17 degrees 37 minutes N. is thus, in a direct line from  Alexandria, about 840 geographical miles of latitude, and, including the  westerly bend of the Nile, its bed will be about eleven hundred miles in  length from the mouth of its last tributary, the Atbara, until it meets  the sea. Thus, eleven hundred miles of absorption and evaporation  through sandy deserts and the delta must be sustained by the river  between the Atbara junction and the Mediterranean: accordingly there is  an immense loss of water; and the grandest volume of the Nile must be  just below the Atbara junction.    It is not my intention in the present work to enter into the details of  my first year's exploration on the Abyssinian frontier; that being so  extensive and so completely isolated from the grand White Nile  expedition, that an amalgamation of the two would create confusion. I  shall therefore reserve the exploration of the Abyssinian tributaries  for a future publication, and confine my present description of the  Abyssinian rivers to a general outline of the Atbara and Blue Nile,  showing the origin of their floods and their effect upon the inundations  in Lower Egypt.    I followed the banks of the Atbara to the junction of the Settite or  Taccazy river; I then followed the latter grand stream into the  Abyssinian mountains in the Base country. From thence I crossed over to  the rivers Salaam and Angrab, at the foot of the magnificent range of  mountains from which they flow direct into the Atbara. Having explored  those rivers, I passed through an extensive and beautiful tract of  country forming a portion of Abyssinia on the south bank of the river  Salaam; and again crossing the Atbara, I arrived at the frontier town of  Gellabat, known by Bruce as \"Ras el Feel.\" Marching due west from that  point I arrived at the river Rahad, in about lat. 12 degrees 30 minutes;  descending its banks I crossed over a narrow strip of country to the  west, arriving at the river Dinder, and following these streams to their  junction with the Blue Nile, I descended that grand river to Khartoum,  having been exactly twelve months from the day I had left Berber.    The whole of the above-mentioned rivers--i.e. the Atbara, Settite,  Salaam, Angrab, Rahad, Dinder, and Blue Nile--are the great drains of  Abyssinia, all having a uniform course from southeast to northwest, and  meeting the main Nile in two mouths; by the Blue Nile at Khartoum, 15  degrees 30 minutes, and by the Atbara, in lat. 17 degrees 37 minutes.  The Blue Nile during the dry season is so reduced that there is not  sufficient water for the small vessels engaged in transporting produce  from Sennaar to Khartoum; at that time the water is beautifully clear,  and, reflecting the cloudless sky, its colour has given it the  well-known name of Bahr el Azrak, or Blue River. No water is more  delicious than that of the Blue Nile; in great contrast to that of the  White river, which is never clear, and has a disagreeable taste of  vegetation. This difference in the quality of the waters is a  distinguishing characteristic of the two rivers: the one, the Blue Nile,  is a rapid mountain stream, rising and falling with great rapidity; the  other is of lake origin, flowing through vast marshes. The course of the  Blue Nile is through fertile soil; thus there is a trifling loss by  absorption, and during the heavy rains a vast amount of earthy matter of  a red colour is contributed by its waters to the general fertilizing  deposit of the Nile in Lower Egypt.    The Atbara, although so important a river in the rainy season of  Abyssinia, is perfectly dry for several months during the year, and at  the time I first saw it, June 13, 1861, it was a mere sheet of glaring  sand; in fact a portion of the desert through which it flowed. For  upwards of one hundred and fifty miles from its junction with the Nile,  it is perfectly dry from the beginning of March to June. At intervals of  a few miles there are pools or ponds of water left in the deep holes  below the general average of the river's bed. In these pools, some of  which may be a mile in length, are congregated all the inhabitants of  the river, who as the stream disappears are forced to close quarters in  these narrow asylums; thus, crocodiles, hippopotami, fish, and large  turtle are crowded in extraordinary numbers, until the commencement of  the rains in Abyssinia once more sets them at liberty by sending down a  fresh volume to the river. The rainy season commences in Abyssinia in  the middle of May, but the country being parched by the summer heat, the  first rains are absorbed by the soil, and the torrents do not fill until  the middle of June.    From June to the middle of September the storms are terrific; every  ravine becomes a raging torrent; trees are rooted up by the mountain  streams swollen above their banks, and the Atbara becomes a vast river,  bringing down with an overwhelming current the total drainage of four  large rivers--the Settite, Royan, Salaam, and Angrab--in addition to its  own original volume. Its waters are dense with soil washed from most  fertile lands far from its point of junction with the Nile; masses of  bamboo and driftwood, together with large trees, and frequently the dead  bodies of elephants and buffaloes, are hurled along its muddy waters in  wild confusion, bringing a rich harvest to the Arabs on its banks, who  are ever on the look-out for the river's treasures of fuel and timber.    The Blue Nile and the Atbara receiving the entire drainage of Abyssinia,  at the same time pour their floods into the main Nile in the middle of  June. At that season the White Nile is at a considerable level, although  not at its HIGHEST; and the sudden rush of water descending from  Abyssinia into the main channel, already at a fair level from the White  Nile, causes the annual inundation in Lower Egypt.    During the year that I passed in the northern portion of Abyssinia and  its frontiers, the rains continued with great violence for three months,  the last shower falling on the 16th September, from which date there was  neither dew nor rain until the following May. The great rivers expended,  and the mountain torrents dried up; the Atbara disappeared, and once  more became a sheet of glaring sand. The rivers Settite, Salaam, and  Angrab, although much reduced, are nevertheless perennial streams,  flowing into the Atbara from the lofty Abyssinian mountains; but the  parched, sandy bed of the latter river absorbs the entire supply, nor  does one drop of water reach the Nile from the Atbara during the dry  season. The wonderful absorption by the sand of that river is an  illustration of the impotence of the Blue Nile to contend unaided with  the Nubian deserts, which, were it not for the steady volume of the  White Nile, would drink every drop of water before the river could pass  the twenty-fifth "]]]
