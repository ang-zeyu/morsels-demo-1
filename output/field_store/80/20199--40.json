Then, too, I think I'd better make the landing springs a little  stiffer. The last time I made a descent the frame was pretty well  jarred up. Yes, if I make that air trip to-morrow I'll have to do  some tall hustling when I get home.\"    The electric runabout swung into the yard of the Swift house, and  Tom brought it to a stop opposite the side door. He looked about for  a sight of his father, Mrs. Baggert or Garret Jackson. The only  person visible was Eradicate Sampson, working in the garden.    \"Hello, Rad,\" called Tom. \"Anybody home?\"    \"Yais, Massa Tom,\" answered the colored man. \"Yo' dad an' anodder  gen'mans hab jest gone in de house.\"    \"Who's the other gentleman, Rad?\" asked Tom, and the negro, glad of  an excuse to cease the weeding of the onion bed, came shuffling  forward.    \"It's de gen'mans what is allers saying his prayers,\" he answered.    \"Saying his prayers?\" repeated Tom.    \"Yep. Yo' knows what I means, Massa Tom. He's allers askin' a  blessin' on his shoes, or his rubbers, or his necktie.\"    \"Oh, you mean Mr. Wakefield Damon.\"    \"Yais, sah, dat's who I done means. Mr. Wakefull Lemon--dat's sho'  him.\"    At that moment there sounded, within the house, the voices of Mr.  Swift, and some one else in conversation.    \"And so Tom has decided to make a run to the Quaker City in the  BUTTERFLY, to-morrow,\" Mr. Swift was saying, \"and he's going to see  if he can be of any service to this Mr. Fenwick.\"    \"Bless my watch chain!\" exclaimed the other voice. \"You don't say  so! Why I know Mr. Fenwick very well--he and I used to go to school  together, but bless my multiplication tables--I never thought he'd  amount to anything! And so he's built an airship; and Tom is going  to help him with it? Why, bless my collar button, I've a good notion  to go along and see what happens. Bless my very existence, but I  think I will!\"    \"That's Mr. Damon all right,\" observed Tom, with a smile, as he  advanced toward the dining-room, whence the voices proceeded.    \"Dat's what I done tole you!\" said Eradicate, and, with slow and  lagging steps he went back to weed the onion bed.    \"How are you, Mr. Damon,\" called our hero, as he mounted the steps  of the porch.    \"Why, it's Tom--he's back!\" exclaimed the eccentric man. \"Why, bless  my shoe laces, Tom! how are you? I'm real glad to see you. Bless my  eyeglasses, but I am! I just returned from a little western trip,  and I thought I'd rUn over and see how you are. I came in my car--had  two blowouts on the way, too. Bless my spark plug, but the kind  of tires one gets now-a-days are a disgrace! However, I'm here, and  your father has just told me about you going to Philadelphia in your  monoplane, to help a fellow-inventor with his airship. It's real  kind of you. Bless my topknot if it isn't! Do you know what I was  just saying?\"    \"I heard you mention that you knew Mr. Fenwick,\" replied Tom, with a  smile, as he shook hands with Mr. Damon.    \"So I do, and, what's more, I'd like to see his airship. Will your  BUTTERFLY carry two passengers?\"    \"Easily, Mr. Damon.\"    \"Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do. If you'll let me I'll take  that run to Philadelphia with you!\"    \"Glad to have you come along,\" responded Tom, heartily.    \"Then I'll go, and, what's more, if Fenwick's ship will rise, I'll  go with you in that--bless my deflection rudder if I don't, Tom!\"  and puffing up his cheeks, as he exploded these words, Mr. Damon  fairly raised himself on his tiptoes, and shook Tom's hand again.          CHAPTER V    VOL-PLANING TO EARTH      For a moment after Mr. Damon's announcement Tom did not reply. Mr.  Swift, too, seemed a little at a loss for something to say. They did  not quite know how to take their eccentric friend at times.    \"Of course I'll be glad of your company, Mr. Damon,\" said Tom: \"but  you must remember that my BUTTERFLY is not like the RED CLOUD. There  is more danger riding in the monoplane than there is in the airship.  In the latter, if the engine happens to stop, the sustaining gas  will prevent us from falling. But it isn't so in an aeroplane. When  your engine stops there--\"    \"Well, what happens?\" asked Mr. Damon, impatiently, for Tom  hesitated.    \"You have to vol-plane back to earth.\"    \"Vol-plane?\" and there was a questioning note in Mr. Damon's voice.    \"Yes, glide down from whatever height you are at when the engine  stalls. Come down in a series of dips from the upper currents.  Vol-planing, the French call it, and I guess it's as good a word as  any.\"    \"Have you ever done it?\" asked the odd character.    \"Oh, yes, several times.\"    \"Then, bless my fur overcoat! I can do it, too, Tom. When will you  be ready to start?\"    \"To-morrow morning. Now you are sure you won't get nervous and want  to jump, if the engine happens to break down?\"    \"Not a bit of it. I'll vol-plane whenever you are ready,\" and Mr.  Damon laughed.    \"Well, we'll hope we won't have to,\" went on Tom. \"And I'll be very  glad of your company. Mr. Fenwick will, no doubt, be pleased to see  you. I've never met him, and it will be nice to have some one to  introduce me. Suppose you come out and see what sort of a craft you  are doomed to travel in to-morrow, Mr. Damon. I believe you never  saw my new monoplane.\"    \"That's right, I haven't, but I'd be glad to. I declare, I'm getting  to be quite an aviator,\" and Mr. Damon chuckled. A little later,  Tom, having informed his father of the sending of the message, took  his eccentric friend out to the shop, and exhibited the BUTTERFLY.    As many of you have seen the ordinary monoplane, either on  exhibition or in flight, I will not take much space to describe  Tom's. Sufficient to say it was modeled after the one in which  Bleriot made his first flight across the English channel.    The body was not unlike that of a butterfly or dragon fly, long and  slender, consisting of a rectangular frame with canvas stretched  over it, and a seat for two just aft of the engine and controlling  levers. Back of the seat stretched out a long framework, and at the  end was a curved plane, set at right angles to it. The ends of the  plane terminated in flexible wings, to permit of their being bent up  or down, so as to preserve the horizontal equilibrium of the craft.    At the extreme end was the vertical rudder, which sent the monoplane  to left or right.    Forward, almost exactly like the front set of wings of the dragon  fly, was the large, main plane, with the concave turn toward the  ground. There was the usual propeller in front, operated by a four  cylinder motor, the cylinders being air cooled, and set like the  spokes of a wheel around the motor box. The big gasolene tank, and  other mechanism was in front of the right-hand operator's seat,  where Tom always rode. He had seldom taken a passenger up with him,  though the machine would easily carry two, and he was a little  nervous about the outcome of the trip with Mr. Damon.    \"How do you like the looks of it?\" asked the young inventor, as he  wheeled the BUTTERFLY out of the shed, and began pumping up the  tires of the bicycle wheels on which it ran over the ground, to get  impetus enough with which to rise.    \"It looks a little frail, compared to the big RED CLOUD, Tom,\"  answered the eccentric man, \"but I'm going up in her just the same;  bless my buttons if I'm not.\"    Tom could not but admire the grit of his friend.    The rest of the day was busily spent making various adjustments to  the monoplane, putting on new wire stays, changing the rudder  cables, and tuning up the motor. The propeller was tightened on the  shaft, and toward evening Tom announced that all was in readiness  for a trial flight.    \"Want to come, Mr. Damon?\" he asked.    \"I'll wait, and see how it acts with you aboard,\" was the answer.  \"Not that I'm afraid, for I'm going to make the trip in the morning,  but perhaps it won't work just right now.\"    \"Oh, I guess it will,\" ventured Tom, and in order to be able to know  just how his BUTTERFLY was going to behave, with a passenger of Mr.  Damon's weight, the young inventor placed a bag of sand on the extra  seat.    The monoplane was then wheeled to the end of the starting ground.  Tom took his place in the seat, and Mr. Jackson started the  propeller. At first the engine failed to respond, but suddenly with  a burst of smoke, and a spluttering of fire the cylinders began  exploding. The hat of Mr. Damon, who was standing back of the  machine, was blown off by the wind created by the propeller.    \"Bless my gaiters!\" he exclaimed, \"I never thought it was as strong  as that!\"    \"Let go!\" cried Tom to Mr. Jackson and Eradicate, who were holding  back the monoplane from gliding over the ground.    \"All right,\" answered the engineer.    An instant later the explosions almost doubled, for Tom turned on  more gasolene. Then, like some live thing, the BUTTERFLY rushed  across the starting ground. Faster and faster it went, until the  young inventor, knowing that he had motion enough, tilted his planes  to catch the wind.    Up he went from earth, like some graceful bird, higher and higher,  and then, in a big spiral, he began ascending until he was five  hundred feet in the air. Up there he traveled back and forth, in  circles, and in figure eights, desiring to test the machine in  various capacities.    Suddenly the engine stopped, and to those below, anxiously watching,  the silence became almost oppressive, for Tom had somewhat  descended, and the explosions had been plainly heard by those  observing him. But now they ceased!    \"His engine's stalled!\" cried Garret Jackson.    Mr. Swift heard the words, and looked anxiously up at his son.    \"Is he in any danger?\" gasped Mr. Damon.    No one answered him. Like some great bird, disabled in mid flight,  the monoplane swooped downward. A moment later a hearty shout from  Tom reassured them.    \"He shut off the engine on purpose,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#5)"],[1,"prudently, \"it will cost something.  How much would you want for it?\"    \"Well,\" replied Mr. Damon, \"I paid two hundred and fifty dollars  last week. I have ridden a hundred miles on it. That is at the rate  of two dollars and a half a mile--pretty expensive riding. But if  you are in earnest I will let you have the machine for fifty  dollars, and then I fear that I will be taking advantage of you.\"    \"I'll give you fifty dollars,\" said Tom quickly, and Mr. Damon  exclaimed:    \"Bless my liver--that is, if I have one. Do you mean it?\"    Tom nodded. \"I'll fetch you the money right away,\" he said, starting  for his room. He got the cash from a small safe he had arranged,  which was fitted up with an ingenious burglar alarm, and was on his  way downstairs when he heard his father call out:    \"Here! What do you want? Go away from that shop! No one is allowed  there!\" and looking from an upper window, Tom saw his father running  toward a stranger, who was just stepping inside the shop where Mr.  Swift was constructing his turbine motor. Tom started as he saw that  the stranger was the same black-mustached man whom he had noticed in  the post-office, and, later, in the restaurant at Mansburg.          CHAPTER V.    MR. SWIFT IS ALARMED      Stuffing the money which he intended to give to Mr. Damon in his  pocket, Tom ran downstairs. As he passed through the living-room,  intending to see what the disturbance was about, and, if necessary,  aid his father, the owner of the broken motor-cycle exclaimed:    \"What's the matter? What has happened? Bless my coat-tails, but is  anything wrong?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom. \"There is a stranger about the shop,  and my father never allows that. I'll be back in a minute.\"    \"Take your time,\" advised the somewhat eccentric Mr. Damon. \"I find  my legs are a bit weaker than I suspected, and I will be glad to  rest a while longer. Bless my shoelaces, but don't hurry!\"    Tom went into the rear yard, where the shops, in a small cluster of  buildings, were located. He saw his father confronting the man with  the black mustache, and Mr. Swift was saying:    \"What do you want? I allow no people to come in here unless I or my  son invites them. Did you wish to see me?\"    \"Are you Mr. Barton Swift?\" asked the man.    \"Yes, that is my name.\"    \"The inventor of the Swift safety lamp, and the turbine motor?\"    At the mention of the motor Mr. Swift started.    \"I am the inventor of the safety lamp you mention,\" he said stiffly,  \"but I must decline to talk about the motor. May I ask where you  obtained your information concerning it?\"    \"Why, I am not at liberty to tell,\" went on the man. \"I called to  see if we could negotiate with you for the sale of it. Parties whom  I represent--\"    At that moment Tom plucked his father by the sleeve.    \"Dad,\" whispered the youth, \"I saw him in Mansburg. I think he is  one of several who have been inquiring in Mr. Merton's shop about  you and your patents. I wouldn't have anything to do with him until  I found out more about him.\"    \"Is that so?\" asked Mr. Swift quickly. Then, turning to the  stranger, he said: \"My son tells me--\"    But Mr. Swift got no further, for at that moment the stranger caught  sight of Tom, whom he had not noticed before.    \"Ha!\" exclaimed the man. \"I have forgotten something--an important  engagement--will be back directly--will see you again, Mr. Swift--excuse  the trouble I have put you to--I am in a great hurry,\" and before  father or son could stop him, had they any desire to, the man  turned and walked quickly from the yard.    Mr. Swift stood staring at him, and so did Tom. Then the inventor  asked:    \"Do you know that man? What about him, Tom? Why did he leave so  hurriedly?\"    \"I don't know his name,\" replied Tom, \"but I am suspicious regarding  him, and I think he left because he suddenly recognized me.\"  Thereupon he told his father of seeing the man in the post-office,  and hearing the talk of the same individual and two companions in  the restaurant.    \"And so you think they are up to some mischief, Tom?\" asked the  parent when the son had finished.    \"Well, I wouldn't go quite as far as that, but I think they are  interested in your patents, and you ought to know whether you want  them to be, or not.\"    \"I most certainly do not--especially in the turbine motor. That is  my latest invention, and, I think, will prove very valuable. But,  though I have not mentioned it before, I expect to have trouble with  it. Soon after I perfected it, with the exception of some minor  details, I received word from a syndicate of rich men that I was  infringing on a motor, the patent of which they controlled.\"    \"This surprised me for two reasons. One was because I did not know  that any one knew I had invented the motor. I had kept the matter  secret, and I am at a loss to know how it leaked out. To prevent any  further information concerning my plans becoming public, I sent you  to Mansburg to-day. But it seems that the precaution was of little  avail. Another matter of surprise was the information that I was  infringing on the patent of some one else. I had a very careful  examination made, and I found that the syndicate of rich men was  wrong. I was not infringing. In fact, though the motor they have is  somewhat like mine, there is one big difference--theirs does not  work, while mine does. Their patents are worthless.\"    \"Then what do you think is their object?\"    \"I think they want to get control of my invention of the turbine  motor, Tom. That is what has been worrying me lately. I know these  men to be unscrupulous, and, with plenty of money, they may make  trouble for me.\"    \"But can't you fight them in the courts?\"    \"Yes, I could do that. It is not as if I was a poor man, but I do  not like lawsuits. I want to live quietly and invent things. I  dislike litigation. However, if they force it on me I will fight!\"  exclaimed Mr. Swift determinedly.    \"Do you think this man was one of the crowd of financiers?\" asked  Tom.    \"It would be hard to say. I did not like his actions, and the fact  that he sneaked in here, as if he was trying to get possession of  some of my models or plans, makes it suspicious.\"    \"It certainly does,\" agreed Tom. \"Now, if we only knew his name we  could--\"    He suddenly paused in his remark and sprang forward. He picked up an  envelope that had dropped where the stranger had been standing.    \"The man lost this from his pocket, dad,\" said Tom eagerly. \"It's a  telegram. Shall we look at it?\"    \"I think we will be justified in protecting ourselves. Is the  envelope open?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then read the telegram.\"    Tom drew out a folded yellow slip of paper. It was a short message.  He read:    \"'Anson Morse, Mansburg. See Swift to-day. Make offer. If not  accepted do the best you can. Spare no effort. Don't give plans  away.'\"    \"Is that all?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"All except the signature.\"    \"Who is the telegram signed by?\"    \"By Smeak & Katch,\" answered Tom.    \"Those rascally lawyers!\" exclaimed his father. \"I was beginning to  suspect this. That is the firm which represents the syndicate of  wealthy men who are trying to get my turbine motor patents away from  me. Tom, we must be on our guard! They will wage a fierce fight  against me, for they have sunk many thousands of dollars in a  worthless machine, and are desperate.\"    \"We'll fight 'em!\" cried Tom. \"You and I, dad! We'll show 'em that  the firm of Swift & Son is swift by name and swift by nature!\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed the inventor. \"I'm glad you feel that way about  it, Tom. But we are going to have no easy task. Those men are rich  and unscrupulous. We shall have to be on guard constantly. Let me  have that telegram. It may come in useful. Now I must send word to  Reid & Crawford, my attorneys in Washington, to be on the lookout.  Matters are coming to a curious pass.\"    As Mr. Swift and his son started for the house, they met Mr. Damon  coming toward them.    \"Bless my very existence!\" cried the eccentric man. \"I was beginning  to fear something had happened to you. I am glad that you are all  right. I heard voices, and I imagined--\"    \"It's all right,\" Mr. Swift reassured him. \"There was a stranger  about my shop, and I never allow that. Do you feel well enough to  go? If not we shall be glad to have you remain with us. We have  plenty of room.\"    \"Oh, thank you very much, but I must be going. I feel much better.  Bless my gaiters, but I never will trust myself in even an  automobile again! I will renounce gasolene from now on.\"    \"That reminds me,\" spoke Tom. \"I have the money for the motor-cycle,\"  and he drew out the bills. \"You are sure you will not regret your  bargain, Mr. Damon? The machine is new, and needs only slight  repairs. Fifty dollars is--\"    \"Tut, tut, young man! I feel as if I was getting the best of you.  Bless my handkerchief! I hope you have no bad luck with it.\"    \"I'll try and be careful,\" promised Tom with a smile as he handed  over the money. \"I am going to gear it differently and put some  improvements on it. Then I will use it instead of my bicycle.\"    \"It would have to be very much improved before I trusted myself on  it again,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"Well, I appreciate what you have  done for me, and if at any time I can reciprocate the favor, I will  only be too glad to do so. Bless my soul, though, I hope I don't  have to rescue you from trying to climb a tree,\" and with a laugh,  which showed that he had fully recovered from his mishap, he shook  hands with father and son and left.    \"A very nice man, Tom,\" commented Mr. Swift. \"Somewhat odd and out  of the ordinary, but a very fine character, for all that.\"    \"That's what I say,\" added the son. \"Now, dad, you'll see me  scooting around the country on a motor-cycle. I've always wanted  one, and now I have a bargain.\"    \"Do you think you can repair it?\"    \"Of course, dad. I've done more difficult things"]]]
