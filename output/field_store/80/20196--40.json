He seemed to turn this over in his mind; and then, \"Davie, my man,\" said  he, \"ye've come to the right bit when ye came to your uncle Ebenezer.  I've a great notion of the family, and I mean to do the right by you;  but while I'm taking a bit think to mysel' of what's the best thing to  put you to--whether the law, or the meenistry, or maybe the army, whilk  is what boys are fondest of--I wouldnae like the Balfours to be humbled  before a wheen Hieland Campbells, and I'll ask you to keep your tongue  within your teeth. Nae letters; nae messages; no kind of word to  onybody; or else--there's my door.\"    \"Uncle Ebenezer,\" said I, \"I've no manner of reason to suppose you mean  anything but well by me. For all that, I would have you to know that I  have a pride of my own. It was by no will of mine that I came seeking  you; and if you show me your door again, I'll take you at the word.\"    He seemed grievously put out. \"Hoots-toots,\" said he, \"ca' cannie,  man--ca' cannie! Bide a day or two. I'm nae warlock, to find a fortune  for you in the bottom of a parritch bowl; but just you give me a day or  two, and say naething to naebody, and as sure as sure, I'll do the right  by you.\"    \"Very well,\" said I, \"enough said. If you want to help me, there's no  doubt but I'll be glad of it, and none but I'll be grateful.\"    It seemed to me (too soon, I dare say) that I was getting the upper  hand of my uncle; and I began next to say that I must have the bed and  bedclothes aired and put to sun-dry; for nothing would make me sleep in  such a pickle.    \"Is this my house or yours?\" said he, in his keen voice, and then all of  a sudden broke off. \"Na, na,\" said he, \"I didnae mean that. What's mine  is yours, Davie, my man, and what's yours is mine. Blood's thicker than  water; and there's naebody but you and me that ought the name.\" And  then on he rambled about the family, and its ancient greatness, and his  father that began to enlarge the house, and himself that stopped the  building as a sinful waste; and this put it in my head to give him  Jennet Clouston's message.    \"The limmer!\" he cried. \"Twelve hunner and fifteen--that's every day  since I had the limmer rowpit!* Dod, David, I'll have her roasted on red  peats before I'm by with it! A witch--a proclaimed witch! I'll aff and  see the session clerk.\"         * Sold up.    And with that he opened a chest, and got out a very old and  well-preserved blue coat and waistcoat, and a good enough beaver hat,  both without lace. These he threw on any way, and taking a staff from  the cupboard, locked all up again, and was for setting out, when a  thought arrested him.    \"I cannae leave you by yoursel' in the house,\" said he. \"I'll have to  lock you out.\"    The blood came to my face. \"If you lock me out,\" I said, \"it'll be the  last you'll see of me in friendship.\"    He turned very pale, and sucked his mouth in.    \"This is no the way,\" he said, looking wickedly at a corner of the  floor--\"this is no the way to win my favour, David.\"    \"Sir,\" says I, \"with a proper reverence for your age and our common  blood, I do not value your favour at a boddle's purchase. I was brought  up to have a good conceit of myself; and if you were all the uncle, and  all the family, I had in the world ten times over, I wouldn't buy your  liking at such prices.\"    Uncle Ebenezer went and looked out of the window for awhile. I could  see him all trembling and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he  turned round, he had a smile upon his face.    \"Well, well,\" said he, \"we must bear and forbear. I'll no go; that's all  that's to be said of it.\"    \"Uncle Ebenezer,\" I said, \"I can make nothing out of this. You use me  like a thief; you hate to have me in this house; you let me see it,  every word and every minute: it's not possible that you can like me; and  as for me, I've spoken to you as I never thought to speak to any man.  Why do you seek to keep me, then? Let me gang back--let me gang back to  the friends I have, and that like me!\"    \"Na, na; na, na,\" he said, very earnestly. \"I like you fine; we'll agree  fine yet; and for the honour of the house I couldnae let you leave the  way ye came. Bide here quiet, there's a good lad; just you bide here  quiet a bittie, and ye'll find that we agree.\"    \"Well, sir,\" said I, after I had thought the matter out in silence,  \"I'll stay awhile. It's more just I should be helped by my own blood  than strangers; and if we don't agree, I'll do my best it shall be  through no fault of mine.\"          CHAPTER IV    I RUN A GREAT DANGER IN THE HOUSE OF SHAWS    For a day that was begun so ill, the day passed fairly well. We had the  porridge cold again at noon, and hot porridge at night; porridge and  small beer was my uncle's diet. He spoke but little, and that in the  same way as before, shooting a question at me after a long silence; and  when I sought to lead him to talk about my future, slipped out of it  again. In a room next door to the kitchen, where he suffered me to go,  I found a great number of books, both Latin and English, in which I took  great pleasure all the afternoon. Indeed, the time passed so lightly in  this good company, that I began to be almost reconciled to my residence  at Shaws; and nothing but the sight of my uncle, and his eyes playing  hide and seek with mine, revived the force of my distrust.    One thing I discovered, which put me in some doubt. This was an entry on  the fly-leaf of a chap-book (one of Patrick Walker's) plainly written  by my father's hand and thus conceived: \"To my brother Ebenezer on his  fifth birthday.\" Now, what puzzled me was this: That, as my father was of  course the younger brother, he must either have made some strange error,  or he must have written, before he was yet five, an excellent, clear  manly hand of writing.    I tried to get this out of my head; but though I took down many  interesting authors, old and new, history, poetry, and story-book, this  notion of my father's hand of writing stuck to me; and when at length I  went back into the kitchen, and sat down once more to porridge and small  beer, the first thing I said to Uncle Ebenezer was to ask him if my  father had not been very quick at his book.    \"Alexander? No him!\" was the reply. \"I was far quicker mysel'; I was a  clever chappie when I was young. Why, I could read as soon as he could.\"    This puzzled me yet more; and a thought coming into my head, I asked if  he and my father had been twins.    He jumped upon his stool, and the horn spoon fell out of his hand upon  the floor. \"What gars ye ask that?\" he said, and he caught me by the  breast of the jacket, and looked this time straight into my eyes:  his own were little and light, and bright like a bird's, blinking and  winking strangely.    \"What do you mean?\" I asked, very calmly, for I was far stronger than  he, and not easily frightened. \"Take your hand from my jacket. This is  no way to behave.\"    My uncle seemed to make a great effort upon himself. \"Dod man, David,\"  he said, \"ye should-nae speak to me about your father. That's where the  mistake is.\" He sat awhile and shook, blinking in his plate: \"He was all  the brother that ever I had,\" he added, but with no heart in his voice;  and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again, but still  shaking.    Now this last passage, this laying of hands upon my person and  sudden profession of love for my dead father, went so clean beyond my  comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope. On the one hand,  I began to think my uncle was perhaps insane and might be dangerous;  on the other, there came up into my mind (quite unbidden by me and even  discouraged) a story like some ballad I had heard folk singing, of a  poor lad that was a rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried  to keep him from his own. For why should my uncle play a part with a  relative that came, almost a beggar, to his door, unless in his heart he  had some cause to fear him?    With this notion, all unacknowledged, but nevertheless getting firmly  settled in my head, I now began to imitate his covert looks; so that  we sat at table like a cat and a mouse, each stealthily observing the  other. Not another word had he to say to me, black or white, but was  busy turning something secretly over in his mind; and the longer we  sat and the more I looked at him, the more certain I became that the  something was unfriendly to myself.    When he had cleared the platter, he got out a single pipeful of tobacco,  just as in the morning, turned round a stool into the chimney corner,  and sat awhile smoking, with his back to me.    \"Davie,\" he said, at length, \"I've been thinking;\" then he paused, and  said it again. \"There's a wee bit siller that I half promised ye before  ye were born,\" he continued; \"promised it to your father. O, naething  legal, ye understand; just gentlemen daffing at their wine. Well, I  keepit that bit money separate--it was a great expense, but a promise  is a promise--and it has grown by now to be a matter of just  precisely--just exactly\"--and here he paused and stumbled--\"of just  exactly forty pounds!\" This last he rapped out with a sidelong glance  over his shoulder; and the next moment added, almost with a scream,  \"Scots!\"    The pound Scots being the same thing as an English shilling, the  difference made by this second thought was considerable; I could see,  besides, that the whole story was a lie, invented with some end which  it puzzled me to guess; and I made no attempt to conceal the tone of  raillery in which I answered--    \"O, think again, sir! Pounds sterling, I believe!\"    \"That's what I said,\" returned my uncle: \"pounds sterling!

An efficient force will be posted so as to prevent the entrance  and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. Any neutral vessel  approaching said ports, or attempting to leave the same, without  notice or knowledge of the establishment of such blockade, will be  duly warned by the commander of the blockading forces, who will  indorse on her register the fact and the date of such warning,  where such indorsement was made; and if the same vessel shall  again attempt to enter any blockaded port she will be captured and  sent to the nearest convenient port for such proceedings against  her and her cargo as prize as may be deemed advisable. Neutral  vessels lying in any of said ports at the time of the  establishment of such blockade will be allowed thirty days to  issue therefrom.    In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal  of the United States to be affixed.    Done at the city of Washington this 22d day of April, A. D. 1898,  and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and  twenty-second.    By the President: WILLIAM McKINLEY.    JOHN SHERMAN, Secretary of State.    MORE SPANISH PRIZES TAKEN.    The blockade was not a mere paper blockade, but an exceedingly  effective one. Before two days had passed, the prizes taken began  to multiply in numbers and in value. The second capture was the  Spanish freighter Pedro, of Bilboa, which was taken by the New  York in the afternoon of the first day's cruising.    When the fleet approached the Cuban coast and spread out for  patrol duty, the New York turned eastward for her own watch, not  knowing what might be found in the neighborhood. Far off against  the dim, vague background of Cuban hills, half seen, half guessed,  could be traced a faint film of gray smoke, the one visible  evidence of a Spanish freighter striving vainly to race out the  day without being discovered by the great gray monsters that  blackened the sky to the west with a solid mass of black cloud  from their roaring furnaces.    Vainly the Spaniard raced. Charging along at trial test speed, the  New York soon lay across the bows of the Spanish ship, and the  crashing challenge blazed from the deck of the cruiser. A huge  puff of white smoke rolled out from the side of the flagship, and  far off, just in front of the Spaniard, a fountain of white foam  leaped into the air. In a moment the course of the strange  Spaniard was changed, and she hove to.    Shortly after, the New York led her prize further out from shore  and laid her to. Crew and captain could be seen rushing about the  deck of the ship like a nest of ants, hiding their valuables and  striving to avert some impending fate they could only guess at in  their ignorance. As she came around her name could be clearly read  on her stern, Pedro of Bilboa.    As soon as she was laid alongside, the Pedro was boarded by Ensign  Frank Marble of the New York. Ensign Marble led a prize crew,  consisting of a file of marines and seamen. With great formality  the ensign swung aboard and assumed command. A burly, bare-footed  American tar shoved the Spanish quartermaster away from the wheel  and began to set the course of the Spaniard. The Spanish crew  gathered in a terrified huddle near the forecastle and awaited  developments.    Hardly had the prize crew been put on board before another  freighter was seen going down the coast to the eastward. The New  York, leaving the captured Spanish craft in charge of the prize  crew, drew across the bows of the stranger and sent a shot into  the water directly in front of her bows. She paid no attention to  the challenge, but kept steadily on, and a few seconds later  another shot was sent hurtling across the water in front of her.  After this hostile demonstration she hauled up and soon followed  the New York out to sea. It was discovered, however, that she flew  the German flag, and consequently was permitted to proceed.    The prize crew from the New York took the captured vessel into  port at Key West under its own steam. The ship was bound from  Havana to Santiago with a valuable cargo of rice, iron and beer.  On the same day two other captures were made, one by the torpedo  boat Ericsson, which seized a fishing schooner under the very guns  of Morro Castle and by the torpedo boat, Porter, which took the  Spanish schooner, Mathilde, after a lively chase and a number of  shots. Both of these prizes were taken to Key West to join their  unfortunate friends.    EXCITEMENT IN HAVANA.    It was nearly five o'clock in the afternoon of that lucky Friday,  when the semaphore by the lighthouse in Morro Castle signaled to  the people of Havana that a fleet had been sighted. It was said to  be without any colors to show its nationality. At that time La  Punta, the fort on the side of the harbor opposite Morro Castle,  was crowded with curious people, including many ladies. In  addition, crowds of people could be seen at various points of  vantage, many of them gathering on the roofs of houses. At 6 p.m.  the semaphore signaled that it was the United States fleet which  was in sight, and at 6:15 p.m. a red flag was run up at the  signal station, warning guns were fired from Morro Castle, and  afterward from Cabanas fortress, adjoining it. This caused  excitement throughout the city, and was the first real note of  war. When the first signal came from the semaphore station a  British schooner which was in the harbor put to sea. She was  immediately followed by the German steamer Remus. Some time  afterward the American steamer Saratoga put to sea.    The cannon shots from the fortresses stirred up the regular troops  and volunteers throughout Havana and its vicinity and there was a  rush to quarters. The signal guns from the fortifications echoed  to the palace and through the streets, causing people to rush from  their houses, with the result that all the thoroughfares were soon  crowded with excited inhabitants. Captain General Blanco heard the  shots while at the palace, to which place the generals and  commanders of the volunteers promptly reported, full of excitement  and warlike enthusiasm. Some time afterward the Captain General,  accompanied by his staff, the generals and others, left the palace  and was warmly acclaimed by the soldiers and populace. The General  then made a brief final inspection of the fortifications and went  to a spot from which he could see the approaching fleet.    There was no sign of alarm anywhere. The Spaniards were confident  that Havana was prepared for any eventuality, and they had great  faith in the strength of their forts, batteries, etc., and in the  effectiveness of their heavy artillery. In fact, there was a  feeling of satisfaction at the warlike tremors which spread  everywhere when it was seen that the hour of battle was apparently  approaching and that the Spaniards were soon to give battle to  their enemies.    As the time passed, more people crowded to the spot from which the  fleets could be most favorably seen. By 8:30 p.m. there was a  great movement of the masses through all the streets and on all  the squares. The coffee-houses and clubs were crowded with excited  people, discussing the arrival of the American war ships. The  Spaniards expressed themselves as anxious to measure arms with the  \"invaders,\" and there was no expression of doubt as to the result.  The civil and military authorities of Havana were in consultation  at the palace, and every precaution possible to the Spaniards was  taken to guard against a night surprise and to resist an attack if  the bombardment commenced.    SPAIN'S DAYS OF GRACE EXPIRE.    When President McKinley sent his ultimatum to Spain, he indicated  that it was to expire at noon on Saturday, April 23, and at that  time the period allowed Spain to give up Cuba peacefully was  ended. Spain, however, had not waited to take advantage of this  time limit, but by her own preparations during the days that had  passed, as well as by her diplomatic actions, had indicated  plainly that war was to come. The action of Minister Polo in  demanding his passport and leaving the United States, and the  action of the Spanish government in ejecting Minister Woodford,  were sufficient notifications of the policy which was to be  pursued. It had been unnecessary, therefore, for the fleet to wait  for a more explicit answer before investing Havana. Not until the  expiration of the time allotted by President McKinley to Spain,  did he take definite action which committed the country to a  distinct war policy in advance of the declaration of war by  Congress. But at noon on Saturday the President issued the  following proclamation calling for 125,000 troops to serve two  years if the war should last so long:    BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A PROCLAMATION.    Whereas, by a joint resolution of Congress, approved the 22d of  April, 1898, entitled \"Joint resolution for the recognition of the  independence of the people of Cuba, demanding that the government  of Spain relinquish its authority and government in the island of  Cuba, to withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban  waters, and directing the President of the United States to use  the land and naval forces of the United States to carry these  resolutions into effect,\" and,    Whereas, by an act of Congress,"]]]
