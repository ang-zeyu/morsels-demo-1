(#5)"],[1,"of which these figures are built up, and the darker pores between  them, are, on the other hand, comparatively small, and do not, on the  average, exceed two to four hundred miles in diameter.    But the Sun shows us other objects of quite a different order in their  dimensions. Here and there the bright granules of the photosphere become  disturbed and torn apart, and broad areas are exposed which are relatively  dark. These are _sunspots_, and in the early stages of their development  they are usually arranged in groups which tend to be stretched out  parallel to the Sun's equator. A group of spots in its later stages of  development is more commonly reduced to a single round, well-defined, dark  spot. These groups, when near the edge of the Sun, are usually seen to be  accompanied by very bright markings, arranged in long irregular lines,  like the foam on an incoming tide. These markings are known as the  _faculae_, from their brightness. In the spectroscope, when the serrated  edges of the chromosphere are under observation, every now and then great  _prominences_, or tongues and clouds of flame, are seen to rise up from  them, sometimes changing their form and appearance so rapidly that the  motion can almost be followed by the eye. An interval of fifteen or  twenty minutes has frequently been sufficient to transform, quite beyond  recognition, a mass of flame fifty thousand miles in height. Sometimes a  prominence of these, or even greater, dimensions has formed, developed,  risen to a great distance from the Sun, and completely disappeared within  less than half an hour. The velocity of the gas streams in such eruptions  often exceeds one hundred miles a second; sometimes, though only rarely,  it reaches a speed twice as great.    Sunspots do not offer us examples of motions of this order of rapidity,  but the areas which they affect are not less astonishing. Many spot groups  have been seen to extend over a length of one hundred thousand, or one  hundred and fifty thousand miles, and to cover a total area of a thousand  million square miles. Indeed, the great group of February, 1905, at its  greatest extent, covered an area four times as great as this. Again, in  the normal course of the development of a spot group, the different  members of the group frequently show a kind of repulsion for each other in  the early stages of the group's history, and the usual speed with which  they move away from each other is three hundred miles an hour.    The spots, the faculae, the prominences, are all, in different ways, of  the nature of storms in an atmosphere; that is to say, that, in the great  gaseous bulk of the Sun, certain local differences of constitution,  temperature, and pressure are marked by these different phenomena. From  this point of view it is most significant that many spots are known to  last for more than a month; some have been known to endure for even half a  year. The nearest analogy which the Earth supplies to these disturbances  may be found in tropical cyclones, but these are relatively of far smaller  area, and only last a few days at the utmost, while a hundred miles an  hour is the greatest velocity they ever exhibit, and this, fortunately,  only under exceptional circumstances. For a wind of such violence mows  down buildings and trees as a scythe the blades of grass; and were  tornadoes moving at a rate of 300 miles an hour as common upon the Earth  as spots are upon the Sun, it would be stripped bare of plants and  animals, as well as of men and of all their works.    It is not an accident that the Sun, when storm-swept, shows this violence  of commotion, but a necessary consequence of its enormous temperature and  pressures. As we have seen, the force of gravity at its surface is 27.65  times that at the surface of the Earth, where a body falls 16.1 feet in  the first second of time; on the Sun, therefore, a body would fall 445  feet in the first second; and the atmospheric motions generally would be  accelerated in the same proportion.    The high temperatures, the great pressures, the violent commotions which  prevail on the Sun are, therefore, the direct consequence of its enormous  mass. The Sun is, then, not merely the type and example of the chief  source of light and heat in a given planetary system; it indicates to us  that size and mass are the primary tokens by which we may judge the  temperature of a world, and the activity to be expected in its changes.          CHAPTER IV    THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ELEMENTS IN SPACE      It is now an old story, but still possessing its interest, how Fraunhofer  analysed the light of the Sun by making it pass through a narrow slit and  a prism, and found that the broad rainbow-tinted band of light so obtained  was interrupted by hundreds of narrow dark lines, images in negative of  the slit; and how Kirchhoff succeeded in proving that two of these dark  lines were caused by the white light of the solar photosphere having  suffered absorption at the Sun by passing through a stratum of glowing  sodium vapour. From that time forward it has been known that the Sun is  surrounded by an atmosphere of intensely heated gases, among which figure  many of those elements familiar to us in the solid form on the Earth, such  as iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and the like. These metals,  here the very types of solid bodies, are permanent gases on the Sun.    The Sun, then, is in an essentially gaseous condition, enclosed by the  luminous shell which we term the photosphere. This shell Prof. C. A. Young  and the majority of astronomers regard as consisting of a relatively thin  layer of glowing clouds, justifying the quaint conceit of R. A. Proctor,  who spoke of the Sun as a \"Bubble\"; that is, a globe of gas surrounded by  an envelope so thin in comparison as to be a mere film. There has been  much difference of opinion as to the substance forming these clouds, but  the theory is still widely held which was first put forward by Dr.  Johnstone Stoney in 1867, that they are due to the condensation of carbon,  the most refractory of all known elements. Prof. Abbot, however, refuses  to believe in a surface of this nature, holding that the temperature of  the Sun is too high even at the surface to permit any such condensation.    The application of the spectroscope to astronomy is not confined to the  Sun, but reaches much further. The stars also yield their spectra, and we  are compelled to recognize that they also are suns; intensely heated  globes of glowing gas, rich in the same elements as those familiar to us  on the Earth and known by their spectral lines to be present on the Sun.  The stars, therefore, cannot themselves be inhabited worlds any more than  the Sun, and at a stroke the whole of the celestial luminaries within the  furthest range of our most powerful telescopes are removed from our  present search. Only those members of our solar system that shine by  reflecting the light of the Sun can be cool enough for habitation; the  true stars cannot be inhabited, for, whatever their quality and order,  they are all suns, and must necessarily be in far too highly heated a  condition to be the abode of life. Many of them may, perhaps, be a source  of light and heat to attendant planets, but there is no single instance in  which such a planet has been directly observed; no dark, non-luminous body  has ever been actually seen in attendance on a star. Many double or  multiple stars are known, but these are all instances in which one  sun-like body is revolving round another of the same order.[9] We see no  body shining by reflected light outside the limits of the solar system.  Planets to the various stars may exist in countless numbers, but they are  invisible to us, and we cannot discuss conditions where everything is  unknown. Enquiry in such a case is useless, and speculation vain.    The stars, as revealed to us by the spectroscope are all of the same order  as the Sun, but they are not all of the same species. Quite a large number  of stars, of which Arcturus is one of the best-known examples, show  spectra that are essentially the same as that of the Sun, but there are  other stars of which the spectra bear little or no semblance to it.  Nevertheless, it remains true that, on the whole, stellar spectra bear  witness to the presence of just the same elements as we recognize in the  Sun, though not always in the same proportions or in the same  conditions--hydrogen, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, titanium, and many  more are recognized in nearly all. It is true that not all the known  terrestrial elements have yet been identified in either Sun or stars; but,  in general, those missing are either \"negative\" elements like the  halogens, or elements of great atomic weight like mercury and platinum.  That elements of one class should, as a rule, reveal their presence in Sun  and stars wherever these are placed, and, correspondingly, that other  classes should as generally fail to show themselves, indicate that such  absence is more likely to be due to the general structure of the stellar  photospheres and reversing layers than to any irregularity in the  distribution of matter in the universe. It is easy, for example, to  conceive that the heavy metals may lie somewhat deeper down within the Sun  or star than those of low atomic weight. In the case of the Sun, there  seems a clear connection between atomic weight and the distinctness with  which the element is recognized in the spectrum of the photosphere, the  lower atomic weights showing themselves more conspicuously.    It is clear that not all elements present in a Sun or star show themselves  in its spectrum. Oxygen is very feebly represented by its elemental  lines, but the flutings of titanium oxide are found in sunspots, and with  great distinctness in a certain type of stars. Nitrogen, too, though not  directly recognized, proves its presence by the lines of cyanogen. "]]]
