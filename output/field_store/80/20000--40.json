Albumen is without color, taste, or  smell, and it coagulates by heat, acids, and alcohol.    _Observation._ The white of an egg is composed of albumen, which can  be coagulated or hardened by alcohol. As albumen enters so largely  into the composition of the brain, is not the impaired intellect and  moral degradation of the inebriate attributable to the effect of  alcohol in hardening the albumen of this organ?    59. FIBRIN exists abundantly in the blood, chyle, and lymph. It  constitutes the basis of the muscles. Fibrin is of a whitish color,  inodorous, and insoluble in cold water. It differs from albumen by  possessing the property of coagulating at all temperatures.    _Observation._ Fibrin may be obtained by washing the thick part of  blood with cold water; by this process, the red globules, or coloring  matter, are separated from this element.    60. GELATIN is found in nearly all the solids, but it is not known to  exist in any of the fluids. It forms the basis of the cellular tissue,  and exists largely in the skin, bones, ligaments, and cartilages.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    57. What are proximate elements?

How does albumen differ from fibrin? How can fibrin be obtained? 60.  What is said of gelatin?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Observation._ Gelatin is known from other organic principles by its  dissolving in warm water, and forming \"jelly.\" When dry, it forms the  hard, brittle substance, called _glue_. Isinglass, which is used in  the various mechanical arts, is obtained from the sounds of the  sturgeon.    61. MUCUS is a viscid fluid secreted by the gland-cells, or epithelia.  Various substances are included under the name of mucus. It is  generally alkaline, but its true chemical character is imperfectly  understood. It serves to moisten and defend the mucous membrane. It is  found in the cuticle, brain, and nails; and is scarcely soluble in  water, especially when dry. (Appendix C.)    62. OSMAZOME is a substance of an aromatic flavor. It is of a  yellowish-brown color, and is soluble both in water and alcohol, but  does not form a jelly by concentration. It is found in all the fluids,  and in some of the solids; as the brain.    _Observation._ The characteristic odor and taste of soup are owing to  osmazome.    63. There are several acids found in the human system; as the  _A-ce'tic_, _Ben-zo'ic_, _Ox-al'ic_, _U'ric_, and some other  substances, but not of sufficient importance to require a particular  description.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How is it known from other organic principles? 61.

THE BONES.      64. The bones are firm and hard, and of a dull white color. In all the  higher orders of animals, among which is man, they are in the interior  of the body, while in lobsters, crabs, &c., they are on the outside,  forming a case which protects the more delicate parts from injury.    65. In the mechanism of man, the variety of movements he is called to  perform requires a correspondent variety of component parts, and the  different bones of the system are so admirably adapted to each other,  that they admit of numerous and varied motions.    66. When the bones composing the skeleton are united by natural  ligaments, they form what is called a _natural skeleton_, when united  by wires, what is termed an _artificial skeleton_.    67. The elevations, or protuberances, of the bones are called  _proc'es-ses_, and are, generally, the points of attachment for the  muscles and ligaments.      ANATOMY OF THE BONES.    68. The BONES are composed of both animal and earthy matter. The  earthy portion of the bones gives them solidity and strength, while  the animal part endows them with vitality.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    64. What is said of the bones? 65.

What part of the bones are  called processes? 68-73. _Give the structure of the bones._ 68. Of  what are the bones composed? What are the different uses of the  component parts of the bones?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Experiments._ 1st. To show the earthy without the animal matter, burn  a bone in a clear fire for about fifteen minutes, and it becomes white  and brittle, because the gelatin, or animal matter of the bone, has  been destroyed.    2d. To show the animal without the earthy matter of the bones, immerse  a slender bone for a few days in a weak acid, (one part muriatic acid  and six parts water,) and it can then be bent in any direction. In  this experiment, the acid has removed the earthy matter, (carbonate  and phosphate of lime,) yet the form of the bone is unchanged.    69. The bones are formed from the blood, and are subjected to several  changes before they are perfected. At their early formative stage,  they are cartilaginous. The vessels of the cartilage, at this period,  convey only the _lymph_, or white portion of the blood; subsequently,  they convey red blood. At this time, true ossification (the deposition  of phosphate and carbonate of lime) commences at certain points, which  are called _the points of ossification_.    70. Most of the bones are formed of several pieces, or centres of  ossification. This is seen in the long bones which have their  extremities separated from the body by a thin partition of cartilage.  It is some time before these separate pieces are united to form one  bone.    71. When the process of ossification is completed, there is still a  constant change in the bones. They increase in bulk, and become less  vascular, until middle age. In advanced life, the elevations upon  their surface and near the extremities become more prominent,  particularly in individuals accustomed to labor. As a person advances  in years, the vitality diminishes, and in extreme old age, the earthy  substance predominates; consequently, the bones are extremely  brittle.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How can the earthy matter of the bones be shown?

What is said of the various changes of the bones after  ossification?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    72. The fibrous membrane that invests the bones is called  _per-i-os'te-um_; that which covers the cartilages is called  _per-i-chon'dri-um_. When this membrane invests the skull, it is  called _per-i-cra'ni-um_.    [Illustration: Fig. 6. A section of the knee-joint. The lower part of the  femur, (thigh-bone,) and upper part of the tibia, (leg-bone,) are seen  ossified at 1, 1. The cartilaginous extremities of the two bones are seen  at _d_, _d_. The points of ossification of the extremities, are seen at  2, 2. The patella, or knee-pan, is seen at _c_. 3, A point, or centre of  ossification.]    73. The PERIOSTEUM is a firm membrane immediately investing the bones,  except where they are tipped with cartilage, and the crowns of the  teeth, which are protected by enamel. This membrane has minute nerves,  and when healthy, possesses but little sensibility. It is the  nutrient membrane of the bone, endowing its exterior with vitality; it  also gives insertion to the tendons and connecting ligaments of the  joints.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    72. What is the membrane called that invests the bones? That covers  the cartilage? That invests the skull? Explain fig. 6. 73. Describe  the periosteum.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    74. There are two hundred and eight[3] bones in the human body,  beside the teeth. These, for convenience, are divided into four  parts: 1st. The bones of the _Head_. 2d. The bones of the _Trunk_.  3d. The bones of the _Upper Extremities_. 4th. The bones of the  _Lower Extremities_.       [3] Some anatomists reckon more than this number, others less, for         the reason that, at different periods of life, the number of         pieces of which one bone is formed, varies. _Example._ The         breast-bone, in infancy, has _eight_ pieces; in youth, _three_;         in old age, but _one_.    75. The bones of the HEAD are divided into those of the _Skull_,  _Ear_, and _Face_.    76. The SKULL is composed of eight bones. They are formed of two  plates, or tablets of bony matter, united by a porous portion of bone.  The external tablet is fibrous and tough; the internal plate is dense  and hard, and is called the _vit're-ous_, or glassy table. These  tough, hard plates are adapted to resist the penetration of sharp  instruments, while the different degrees of density possessed by the  two tablets, and the intervening spongy bone, serve to diminish the  vibrations that would occur in falls or blows.    77. The skull is convex externally, and at the base much thicker than  at the top or sides. The most important part of the brain is placed  here, completely out of the way of injury, unless of a very serious  nature. The base of the cranium, or skull, has many projections,  depressions, and apertures; the latter affording passages for the  nerves and blood-vessels.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    74.

But after a while he spake  suddenly, and said: \"My master, I was thinking of a thing.\"    \"Yea, of what?\" said the carle.    \"Of this,\" said Walter; \"that here in this land be strange adventures  toward, and that if we, and I in especial, were to turn our backs on  them, and go home with nothing done, it were pity of our lives: for all  will be dull and deedless there.  I was deeming it were good if we tried  the adventure.\"    \"What adventure?\" said the old man, rising up on his elbow and staring  sternly on him.    Said Walter: \"The wending yonder pass to the eastward, whereby the huge  men come to thee from out of the Bear-country; that we might see what  should come thereof.\"    The carle leaned back again, and smiled and shook his head, and spake:  \"That adventure were speedily proven: death would come of it, my son.\"    \"Yea, and how?\" said Walter.    The carle said: \"The big men would take thee, and offer thee up as a  blood-offering to that woman, who is their Mawmet.  And if ye go all,  then shall they do the like with all of you.\"    Said Walter: \"Is that sure?\"    \"Dead sure,\" said the carle.    \"How knowest thou this?\" said Walter.    \"I have been there myself,\" said the carle.    \"Yea,\" said Walter, \"but thou camest away whole.\"    \"Art thou sure thereof?\" said the carle.    \"Thou art alive yet, old man,\" said Walter, \"for I have seen thee eat thy  meat, which ghosts use not to do.\"  And he laughed.    But the old man answered soberly: \"If I escaped, it was by this, that  another woman saved me, and not often shall that befall.  Nor wholly was  I saved; my body escaped forsooth.  But where is my soul?  Where is my  heart, and my life?  Young man, I rede thee, try no such adventure; but  go home to thy kindred if thou canst.  Moreover, wouldst thou fare alone?  The others shall hinder thee.\"    Said Walter: \"I am the master; they shall do as I bid them: besides, they  will be well pleased to share my goods amongst them if I give them a  writing to clear them of all charges which might be brought against  them.\"    \"My son! my son!\" said the carle, \"I pray thee go not to thy death!\"    Walter heard him silently, but as if he were persuaded to refrain; and  then the old man fell to, and told him much concerning this Bear-folk and  their customs, speaking very freely of them; but Walter's ears were  scarce open to this talk: whereas he deemed that he should have nought to  do with those wild men; and he durst not ask again concerning the country  whereto led the pass on the northward.          CHAPTER VII: WALTER COMES TO THE SHARD IN THE ROCK-WALL      As they were in converse thus, they heard the hunters blowing on their  horns all together; whereon the old man arose, and said: \"I deem by the  blowing that the hunt will be over and done, and that they be blowing on  their fellows who have gone scatter-meal about the wood.  It is now some  five hours after noon, and thy men will be getting back with their  venison, and will be fainest of the victuals they have caught; therefore  will I hasten on before, and get ready fire and water and other matters  for the cooking.  Wilt thou come with me, young master, or abide thy men  here?\"    Walter said lightly: \"I will rest and abide them here; since I cannot  fail to see them hence as they go on their ways to thine house.  And it  may be well that I be at hand to command them and forbid, and put some  order amongst them, for rough playmates they be, some of them, and now  all heated with the hunting and the joy of the green earth.\"  Thus he  spoke, as if nought were toward save supper and bed; but inwardly hope  and fear were contending in him, and again his heart beat so hard, that  he deemed that the carle must surely hear it.  But the old man took him  but according to his outward seeming, and nodded his head, and went away  quietly toward his house.    When he had been gone a little, Walter rose up heedfully; he had with him  a scrip wherein was some cheese and hard-fish, and a little flasket of  wine; a short bow he had with him, and a quiver of arrows; and he was  girt with a strong and good sword, and a wood-knife withal.  He looked to  all this gear that it was nought amiss, and then speedily went down off  the mound, and when he was come down, he found that it covered him from  men coming out of the wood, if he went straight thence to that shard of  the rock-wall where was the pass that led southward.    Now it is no nay that thitherward he turned, and went wisely, lest the  carle should make a backward cast, and see him, or lest any straggler of  his own folk might happen upon him.    For to say sooth, he deemed that did they wind him, they would be like to  let him of his journey.  He had noted the bearings of the cliffs nigh the  shard, and whereas he could see their heads everywhere except from the  depths of the thicket, he was not like to go astray.    He had made no great way ere he heard the horns blowing all together  again in one place, and looking thitherward through the leafy boughs (for  he was now amidst of a thicket) he saw his men thronging the mound, and  had no doubt therefore that they were blowing on him; but being well  under cover he heeded it nought, and lying still a little, saw them go  down off the mound and go all of them toward the carle's house, still  blowing as they went, but not faring scatter-meal.  Wherefore it was  clear that they were nought troubled about him.    So he went on his way to the shard; and there is nothing to say of his  journey till he got before it with the last of the clear day, and entered  it straightway.  It was in sooth a downright breach or cleft in the rock-  wall, and there was no hill or bent leading up to it, nothing but a  tumble of stones before it, which was somewhat uneasy going, yet needed  nought but labour to overcome it, and when he had got over this, and was  in the very pass itself, he found it no ill going: forsooth at first it  was little worse than a rough road betwixt two great stony slopes, though  a little trickle of water ran down amidst of it.  So, though it was so  nigh nightfall, yet Walter pressed on, yea, and long after the very night  was come.  For the moon rose wide and bright a little after nightfall.  But at last he had gone so long, and was so wearied, that he deemed it  nought but wisdom to rest him, and so lay down on a piece of greensward  betwixt the stones, when he had eaten a morsel out of his satchel, and  drunk of the water out of the stream.  There as he lay, if he had any  doubt of peril, his weariness soon made it all one to him, for presently  he was sleeping as soundly as any man in Langton on Holm.          CHAPTER VIII: WALTER WENDS THE WASTE      Day was yet young when he awoke: he leapt to his feet, and went down to  the stream and drank of its waters, and washed the night off him in a  pool thereof, and then set forth on his way again.  When he had gone some  three hours, the road, which had been going up all the way, but somewhat  gently, grew steeper, and the bent on either side lowered, and lowered,  till it sank at last altogether, and then was he on a rough mountain-neck  with little grass, and no water; save that now and again was a soft place  with a flow amidst of it, and such places he must needs fetch a compass  about, lest he be mired.  He gave himself but little rest, eating what he  needs must as he went.  The day was bright and calm, so that the sun was  never hidden, and he steered by it due south.  All that day he went, and  found no more change in that huge neck, save that whiles it was more and  whiles less steep.  A little before nightfall he happened on a shallow  pool some twenty yards over; and he deemed it good to rest there, since  there was water for his avail, though he might have made somewhat more  out of the tail end of the day.    When dawn came again he awoke and arose, nor spent much time over his  breakfast; but pressed on all he might; and now he said to himself, that  whatsoever other peril were athwart his way, he was out of the danger of  the chase of his own folk.    All this while he had seen no four-footed beast, save now and again a  hill-fox, and once some outlandish kind of hare; and of fowl but very  few: a crow or two, a long-winged hawk, and twice an eagle high up aloft.    Again, the third night, he slept in the stony wilderness, which still led  him up and up.  Only toward the end of the day, himseemed that it had  been less steep for a long while: otherwise nought was changed, on all  sides it was nought but the endless neck, wherefrom nought could be seen,  but some other part of itself.  This fourth night withal he found no  water whereby he might rest, so that he awoke parched, and longing to  drink just when the dawn was at its coldest.    But on the fifth morrow the ground rose but little, and at last, when he  had been going wearily a long while, and now, hard on noontide, his  thirst grieved him sorely, he came on a spring welling out from under a  high rock, the water wherefrom trickled feebly away.  So eager was he to  drink, that at first he heeded nought else; but when his thirst was fully  quenched his eyes caught sight of the stream which flowed from the well,  and he gave a shout, for lo! it was running south.  Wherefore it was with  a merry heart that he went on, and as he went, came on more streams, all  running south or thereabouts.  He hastened on all he might, but in  despite of all the speed he made, and that he felt the land now going  down southward, night overtook him in that same wilderness.  Yet when he  stayed at last for sheer weariness, he lay down in what he deemed by the  moonlight to be a shallow valley, with a ridge at the southern end  thereof.    He slept long, and when he awoke the sun was high in the heavens, and  never was brighter or"]]]
