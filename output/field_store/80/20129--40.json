Most of the emigrants were  Huguenots. Geneva sent a large deputation, and among them several  ministers, full of zeal for their land of promise and their new church  in the wilderness. There were five young women, also, with a matron  to watch over them. Soldiers, emigrants, and sailors, two hundred and  ninety in all, were embarked in three vessels; and, to the sound  of cannon, drums, fifes, and trumpets, they unfurled their sails at  Honfleur. They were no sooner on the high seas than the piratical  character of the Norman sailors, in no way exceptional at that  day, began to declare itself. They hailed every vessel weaker than  themselves, pretended to be short of provisions, and demanded leave to  buy them; then, boarding the stranger, plundered her from stem to  stern. After a passage of four months, on the ninth of March, 1557, they  entered the port of Ganabara, and saw the fleur-de-lis floating above  the walls of Fort Coligny. Amid salutes of cannon, the boats, crowded  with sea-worn emigrants, moved towards the landing. It was an edifying  scene when Villegagnon, in the picturesque attire which marked the  warlike nobles of the period, came down to the shore to greet the sombre  ministers of Calvin. With hands uplifted and eyes raised to heaven, he  bade them welcome to the new asylum of the faithful; then launched into  a long harangue full of zeal and unction. His discourse finished, he led  the way to the dining-hall. If the redundancy of spiritual aliment had  surpassed their expectations, the ministers were little prepared for  the meagre provision which awaited their temporal cravings; for, with  appetites whetted by the sea, they found themselves seated at a board  whereof, as one of them complains the choicest dish was a dried fish,  and the only beverage rain-water. They found their consolation in the  inward graces of the commandant, whom they likened to the Apostle Paul.    For a time all was ardor and hope. Men of birth and station, and the  ministers themselves, labored with pick and shovel to finish the fort.  Every day exhortations, sermons, prayers, followed in close succession,  and Villegagnon was always present, kneeling on a velvet cushion brought  after him by a page. Soon, however, he fell into sharp controversy with  the ministers upon points of faith. Among the emigrants was a student of  the Sorbonne, one Cointac, between whom and the ministers arose a fierce  and unintermitted war of words. Is it lawful to mix water with the wine  of the Eucharist? May the sacramental bread be made of meal of  Indian corn? These and similar points of dispute filled the fort with  wranglings, begetting cliques, factions, and feuds without number.  Villegagnon took part with the student, and between them they devised a  new doctrine, abhorrent alike to Geneva and to Rome. The advent of this  nondescript heresy was the signal of redoubled strife. The dogmatic  stiffness of the Geneva ministers chafed Villegagnon to fury. He felt  himself, too, in a false position. On one side he depended on the  Protestant, Coligny; on the other, he feared the Court. There were  Catholics in the colony who might report him as an open heretic. On this  point his doubts were set at rest; for a ship from France brought him  a letter from the Cardinal of Lorraine, couched, it is said, in terms  which restored him forthwith to the bosom of the Church. Villegagnon  now affirmed that he had been deceived in Calvin, and pronounced him a  \"frightful heretic.\" He became despotic beyond measure, and would  bear no opposition. The ministers, reduced nearly to starvation, found  themselves under a tyranny worse than that from which they had fled.    At length he drove them from the fort, and forced them to bivouac on  the mainland, at the risk of being butchered by Indians, until a vessel  loading with Brazil-wood in the harbor should be ready to carry them  back to France. Having rid himself of the ministers, he caused three of  the more zealous Calvinists to be seized, dragged to the edge of a rock,  and thrown into the sea. A fourth, equally obnoxious, but who, being  a tailor, could ill be spared, was permitted to live on condition of  recantation. Then, mustering the colonists, he warned them to shun the  heresies of Luther and Calvin; threatened that all who openly professed  those detestable doctrines should share the fate of their three  comrades; and, his harangue over, feasted the whole assembly, in token,  says the narrator, of joy and triumph.    Meanwhile, in their crazy vessel, the banished ministers drifted slowly  on their way. Storms fell upon them, their provisions failed, their  water-casks were empty, and, tossing in the wilderness of waves, or  rocking on the long swells of subsiding gales, they sank almost to  despair. In their famine they chewed the Brazil-wood with which the  vessel was laden, devoured every scrap of leather, singed and ate the  horn of lanterns, hunted rats through the hold, and sold them to each  other at enormous prices. At length, stretched on the deck, sick,  listless, attenuated, and scarcely able to move a limb, they descried  across the waste of sea the faint, cloud-like line that marked the coast  of Brittany. Their perils were not past; for, if we may believe one of  them, Jean de Lery, they bore a sealed letter from Villegagnon to the  magistrates of the first French port at which they might arrive.  It denounced them as heretics, worthy to be burned. Happily, the  magistrates leaned to the Reform, and the malice of the commandant  failed of its victims.    Villegagnon himself soon sailed for France, leaving the wretched colony  to its fate. He presently entered the lists against Calvin, and engaged  him in a hot controversial war, in which, according to some of his  contemporaries, the knight often worsted the theologian at his own  weapons. Before the year 1558 was closed, Ganabara fell a prey to the  Portuguese. They set upon it in force, battered down the fort, and  slew the feeble garrison, or drove them to a miserable refuge among the  Indians. Spain and Portugal made good their claim to the vast domain,  the mighty vegetation, and undeveloped riches of \"Antarctic France.\"            CHAPTER III.    1562, 1563.    JEAN RIBAUT.    In the year 1562 a cloud of black and deadly portent was thickening over  France. Surely and swiftly she glided towards the abyss of the religious  wars. None could pierce the future, perhaps none dared to contemplate  it: the wild rage of fanaticism and hate, friend grappling with friend,  brother with brother, father with son; altars profaned, hearth-stones  made desolate, the robes of Justice herself bedrenched with murder. In  the gloom without lay Spain, imminent and terrible. As on the hill  by the field of Dreux, her veteran bands of pikemen, dark masses of  organized ferocity, stood biding their time while the battle surged  below, and then swept downward to the slaughter,--so did Spain watch and  wait to trample and crush the hope of humanity.    In these days of fear, a second Huguenot colony sailed for the New  World. The calm, stern man who represented and led the Protestantism  of France felt to his inmost heart the peril of the time. He would  fain build up a city of refuge for the persecuted sect. Yet Gaspar de  Coligny, too high in power and rank to be openly assailed, was forced  to act with caution. He must act, too, in the name of the Crown, and  in virtue of his office of Admiral of France. A nobleman and a  soldier,--for the Admiral of France was no seaman,--he shared the ideas  and habits of his class; nor is there reason to believe him to have been  in advance of his time in a knowledge of the principles of successful  colonization. His scheme promised a military colony, not a free  commonwealth. The Huguenot party was already a political as well as  a religious party. At its foundation lay the religious element,  represented by Geneva, the martyrs, and the devoted fugitives who  sang the psalms of Marot among rocks and caverns. Joined to these were  numbers on whom the faith sat lightly, whose hope was in commotion and  change. Of the latter, in great part, was the Huguenot noblesse, from  Conde, who aspired to the crown,         \"Ce petit homme tant joli,       Qui toujours chante, toujours rit,\"    to the younger son of the impoverished seigneur whose patrimony was his  sword. More than this, the restless, the factious, and the discontented,  began to link their fortunes to a party whose triumph would involve  confiscation of the wealth of the only rich class in France. An element  of the great revolution was already mingling in the strife of religions.    America was still a land of wonder. The ancient spell still hung  unbroken over the wild, vast world of mystery beyond the sea,--a land of  romance, adventure, and gold.    Fifty-eight years later the Puritans landed on the sands of  Massachusetts Bay. The illusion was gone,--the ignis fatuus of  adventure, the dream of wealth. The rugged wilderness offered only a  stern and hard won independence. In their own hearts, and not in  the promptings of a great leader or the patronage of an equivocal  government, their enterprise found its birth and its achievement. They  were of the boldest and most earnest of their sect. There were such  among the French disciples of Calvin; but no Mayflower ever sailed from  a port of France. Coligny's colonists were of a different stamp, and  widely different was their fate.    An excellent seaman and stanch Protestant, Jean Ribaut of Dieppe,  commanded the expedition. Under him, besides sailors, were a band of  veteran soldiers, and a few young nobles. Embarked in two of those  antiquated craft whose high poops and tub-like porportions are  preserved in the old engravings of De Bry, they sailed from Havre on  the eighteenth of February, 1562. They"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#5)"],[1,"looked  steadily back. The minutes passed and neither spoke.    \"Why do you want to go there?\" the governor exclaimed suddenly. He  leaned forward in his chair till his eyes burned across a narrow two  feet into Peter Gross's own.    The strong, firm line of Peter Gross's lips tightened. He rested one  elbow on the table and drew nearer the governor. His voice was little  more than a murmur as he said:    \"Your excellency, let me tell you the story of Bulungan.\"    The governor's face showed surprise. \"Proceed,\" he directed.    \"Six years ago, when your excellency was appointed governor-general of  the Netherlands East Indies,\" Peter Gross began, \"Bulungan was a No  Man's land, although nominally under the Dutch flag. The pirates that  infested the Celebes sea and the straits of Macassar found ports of  refuge in its jungle-banked rivers and marsh mazes where no gun-boat  could find them. The English told your government that if it did not  stamp out piracy and subjugate the Dyaks, it would. That meant loss of  the province to the Dutch crown. Accordingly you sent General Van  Heemkerken there with eight hundred men who marched from the lowlands to  the highlands and back again, burning every village they found, but  meeting no Dyaks except old men and women too helpless to move. General  Van Heemkerken reported to you that he had pacified the country. On his  report you sent Mynheer Van Scheltema there as resident, and Cupido as  _controlleur_. Within six months Van Scheltema was bitten by an adder  placed in his bedroom and Cupido was assassinated by a hill Dyak, who  threw him out of a dugout into a river swarming with crocodiles.    \"_Lieve hemel_, no!\" Van Schouten cried. \"Van Scheltema and Cupido died  of the fevers.\"    \"So it was reported to your excellency,\" Peter Gross replied gravely. \"I  tell you the facts.\"    The governor's thin, spiked jaw shot out like a vicious thorn and his  teeth clicked.    \"Go on,\" he directed sharply.    \"For a year there was neither resident nor _controlleur_ at Bulungan.  Then the pirates became so bold that you again took steps to repress  them. The stockade at the village of Bulungan was enlarged and the  garrison was increased to fifty men. Lieutenant Van Slyck, the  commandant, was promoted to captain. A new resident was appointed,  Mynheer de Jonge, a very dear friend of your excellency. He was an old  man, estimable and honest, but ill-fitted for such a post, a failure in  business, and a failure as a resident. Time after time your excellency  wrote him concerning piracies, hillmen raids, and head-hunting committed  in his residency or the adjoining seas. Each time he replied that your  excellency must be mistaken, that the pirates and head-hunters came from  other districts.\"    The governor's eyes popped in amazement. \"How do you know this?\" he  exclaimed, but Peter Gross ignored the question.    \"Finally about two years ago Mynheer de Jonge, through an accident,  learned that he had been deceived by those he had trusted, had a right  to trust. A remark made by a drunken native opened his eyes. One night  he called out Captain Van Slyck and the latter's commando and made a  flying raid. He all but surprised a band of pirates looting a captured  schooner and might have taken them had they not received a warning of  his coming. That raid made him a marked man. Within two weeks he was  poisoned by being pricked as he slept with a thorn dipped in the juice  of the deadly upas tree.\"    \"He was a suicide!\" the governor exclaimed, his face ashen. \"They  brought me a note in his own handwriting.\"    \"In which it was stated that he killed himself because he felt he had  lost your excellency's confidence?\"    \"You know that, too?\" Van Schouten whispered huskily.    \"Your excellency has suffered remorse without cause,\" Peter Gross  declared quietly. \"The note is a forgery.\"    The governor's hands gripped the edge of the table.    \"You can prove that?\" he cried.    \"For the present your excellency must be satisfied with my word. As  resident of Bulungan I hope to secure proofs that will satisfy a court  of justice.\"    The governor gazed at Peter Gross intently. A conflict of emotions,  amazement, unbelief, and hope were expressed on his face.    \"Why should I believe you?\" he demanded fiercely.    Peter Gross's face hardened. The sternness of the magistrate was on his  brow as he replied:    \"Your excellency remembers the schooner _Tetrina_, attacked by Chinese  and Dyak pirates off the coast of Celebes three years ago? All her crew  were butchered except two left on the deck that night for dead. I was  one of the two, your excellency. My dead comrades have left me a big  debt to pay. That is why I will go to Bulungan.\"    The governor rose. Decision was written on his brow.    \"Meet us here to-night, Mynheer Gross,\" he said. \"There is much to  discuss with Mynheer Sachsen before you leave. God grant you may be the  instrument of His eternal justice.\" Peter Gross raised a hand of  warning.    \"Sometimes the very walls have ears, your excellency,\" he cautioned. \"If  I am to be resident of Bulungan no word of the appointment must leak out  until I arrive there.\"          CHAPTER IV    KOYALA'S PRAYER      It was a blistering hot day in Bulungan. The heavens were molten  incandescence. The muddy river that bisected the town wallowed through  its estuary, a steaming tea-kettle. The black muck-fields baked and  flaked under the torrid heat. The glassy surface of the bay, lying  within the protecting crook of a curling tail of coral reef, quivered  under the impact of the sun's rays like some sentient thing.    In the village that nestled where fresh and salt water met, the streets  were deserted, almost lifeless. Gaunt pariah dogs, driven by the  acid-sharp pangs of a never-satiated hunger, sniffed among the shadows  of the bamboo and palmleaf huts, their backs arched and their tails  slinking between their legs. Too weak to grab their share of the spoil  in the hurly-burly, they scavenged in these hours of universal inanity.  The doors of the huts were tightly closed--barricaded against the heat.  The merchant in his dingy shop, the fisherman in his house on stilts,  and the fashioner of metals in his thatched cottage in the outskirts  slept under their mats. Apoplexy was the swift and sure fate of those  who dared the awful torridity.    Dawn had foretold the heat. The sun shot above the purple and orange  waters of the bay like a conflagration. The miasmal vapors that  clustered thickly about the flats by night gathered their linen and fled  like the hunted. They were scurrying upstream when Bogoru, the  fisherman, walked out on his sampan landing. He looked at the unruffled  surface of the bay, and then looked upward quickly at the lane of tall  kenari trees between the stockade and government buildings on an  elevation a short distance back of the town. The spindly tops of the  trees pointed heavenward with the rigidity of church spires.    \"There will be no chaetodon sold at the _visschersmarkt_ (fishmart)  to-day,\" he observed. \"Kismet!\"    With a patient shrug of his shoulders he went back to his hut and made  sure there was a plentiful supply of sirih and cooling limes on hand.    In the fruit-market Tagotu, the fruiterer, set out a tempting display of  mangosteen, durian, dookoo, and rambootan, pineapples, and pomegranates,  jars of agar-agar, bowls of rice, freshly cooked, and pitchers of milk.    The square was damp from the heavy night dew when he set out the first  basket, it was dry as a fresh-baked brick when he put out the last. The  heavy dust began to flood inward. Tagotu noticed with dismay how thin  the crowd was that straggled about the market-place. Chepang, his  neighbor, came out of his stall and observed:    \"The monsoon has failed again. Bunungan will stay in his huts to-day.\"    \"It is the will of Allah,\" Tagotu replied patiently. Putting aside his  offerings, he lowered the shades of his shop and composed himself for a  siesta.    On the hill above the town, where the rude fort and the government  buildings gravely faced the sea, the heat also made itself felt. The  green blinds of the milk-white residency building, that was patterned as  closely as tropical conditions would permit after the quaint  architecture of rural Overysel, were tightly closed. The little cluster  of residences around it, the _controlleur's_ house and the homes of  Marinus Blauwpot and Wang Fu, the leading merchants of the place, were  similarly barricaded. For \"Amsterdam,\" the fashionable residential  suburb of Bulungan village, was fighting the same enemy as \"Rotterdam,\"  the town below, an enemy more terrible than Dyak blow-pipes and Dyak  poisoned arrows, the Bornean sun.    Like Bogoru, the fisherman, and Tagotu, the fruit-vender, Cho Seng,  Mynheer Muller's valet and cook, had seen the threat the sunrise  brought. The sun's copper disc was dyeing the purple and blue waters of  the bay with vermilion and magentas when he pad-padded out on the  veranda of the _controlleur's_ house. He was clad in the meticulously  neat brown jeans that he wore at all times and occasions except funeral  festivals, and in wicker sandals. With a single sweep of his eyes he  took in the kenari-tree-lined land that ran to the gate of the stockade  where a sleepy sentinel, hunched against a pert brass cannon, nodded his  head drowsily. The road was tenantless. He shot another glance down the  winding pathway that led by the houses of Marinus Blauwpot and Wang Fu  to the town below. That also was unoccupied. Stepping off the veranda,  he crossed over to an unshaded spot directly in front of the house and  looked intently seaward to where a junk lay at anchor. The brown jeans  against the milk-white paint of the house threw his figure in sharp  relief.    Cho Seng waited until a figure showed itself on the deck of the junk.  Then he shaded his eye with his arm. The Chinaman on the deck"]]]
