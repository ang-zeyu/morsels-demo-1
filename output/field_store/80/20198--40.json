[16] Compare Malachi iv, 5-6.      [17] See Isaiah xi.      [18] Compare Acts iii, 22-23.    17. Having delivered his message, the angel departed, the light in the  room seeming to condense about his person, and disappearing with him.  But the heavenly visitant returned a second and a third time during  the night, each time repeating the instructions, with additional  admonitions as to the requirements, and warnings regarding temptations  that would assail the youthful seer. On the following day, Moroni  appeared to Joseph again, reciting anew the instructions and cautions  of the preceding night, and telling him to acquaint his father with  all he had heard and seen. This the boy did, and the father promptly  testified that the communications were from God.    =18.= Joseph soon repaired to the hill described to him in the vision.  He recognized the spot indicated by the angel, and with some labor  laid bare a stone box containing the plates and other things spoken of  by Moroni. The heavenly messenger again stood beside him, and forbade  the removal of the contents at that time, saying that four years were  to elapse before the plates would be committed to his care, and that  it would be his duty to visit the spot at yearly intervals. On the  occasion of each of these visits the angel instructed the young man  more fully regarding the great work awaiting him.    =19.= It is not the purpose of the present lecture to review in detail  the life and ministry of Joseph Smith;[19] so much attention has been  given to the opening scenes of his divinely-appointed mission, in view  of the unusual importance associated with the ushering in of the  modern or new dispensation of God's providence. The bringing forth of  the plates from their resting-place of centuries, their translation by  divine power, and the publication of the record as the Book of Mormon,  shall receive attention on a later occasion; for the present it is  sufficient to say that the ancient record has been translated; that  the Book of Mormon has been given to the world; and that the volume is  accepted as scripture by the Latter-day Saints.      [19] See Note 5.    =20. Later Developments: the Martyrdom.=--In due time, the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, the Priesthood having  been restored through the ordination of Joseph Smith by those who had  held the keys of that authority in former dispensations. From an  initial membership of but six persons, the Church grew to include  thousands during the life-time of the Prophet Joseph; and the growth  has continued with phenomenal rapidity and stability until the present  time. One by one the powers and authorities possessed by the Church of  old were restored through the man who was chosen and ordained to be  the first elder of the latter-day dispensation. With the spread of the  Church, persecution increased, and the effect of evil opposition  reached a climax in the cruel martyrdom of the prophet, and his  brother Hyrum, then patriarch of the Church, June 27, 1844. The  incidents leading up to and culminating in the foul murder of these  men at Carthage, Illinois, are matters of common history. Suffice it  to say that prophet and patriarch gave the sacred seal of their life's  blood to the testimony of the truth, which they had valiantly  maintained in the face of intolerant persecution for nearly a quarter  of a century.[20]      [20] See Note 4.    =21. Authenticity of Joseph Smith's Mission.=--The evidence of divine  authority in the work established by Joseph Smith, and of the  justification of the claims made by and for the man, may be summarized  as follows:    I. Ancient prophecy has been fulfilled in the restoration of the  gospel and the re-establishment of the Church upon the earth through  his instrumentality.    II. He received by direct ordination and appointment, at the hands of  those who held the power in former dispensations, the authority to  minister in the various ordinances of the gospel.    III. His possession of the power of true prophecy, and of other  spiritual gifts, is shown by the results of his ministry.    IV. His doctrines are both true and scriptural.    Each of these classes of evidence will receive attention and find  ample demonstration in the course of our study of the Articles of  Faith; and a detailed consideration will not be attempted at this  stage of our investigation; a few illustrations, briefly stated,  however, may not be out of place.    =22. I. The Fulfilment of Prophecy=, wrought through the life work of  Joseph Smith, is abundantly shown. John the Revelator, from his  prophetic vision of the latter-day dispensation, understood and  predicted that the gospel would be again sent from the heavens, and be  restored to the earth through the direct ministration of an  angel:--\"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having  the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth,  and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\"[21] A  partial fulfilment of this prediction is claimed in the manifestation  of the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith, as already described, whereby the  restoration of the gospel was announced, and the speedy realization of  other ancient prophecies was promised; and a record, described in part  as containing \"the fulness of the everlasting gospel,\" was committed  to his care for translation and publication among all nations,  kindred, and tongues. The remainder of John's fateful utterance,  regarding the authorized call for repentance and the execution of  God's judgment preparatory to the awful scenes of the last days, is  now in process of rapid and literal fulfilment.      [21] Rev. xiv, 6. See Note 9.    =23.= Malachi predicted the coming of Elijah specially commissioned  with power to inaugurate the work of co-operation between the fathers  and the children, and announced this mission as a necessary  preliminary to the advent of \"the great and dreadful day of the  Lord.\"[22] The angel Moroni confirmed the truth and significance of  this prediction in an emphatic reiteration.[23] Joseph Smith and his  associate in the ministry, Oliver Cowdery, solemnly testify that they  were visited by Elijah the prophet, in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio,  on the third day of April, 1836; on which occasion the heavenly  messenger declared that the day spoken of by Malachi had fully come;  \"Therefore,\" continued he, \"the keys of this dispensation are  committed into your hands, and by this ye may know that the great and  dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.\"[24] The  particular nature of the union of the fathers and the children, upon  which both Malachi and Moroni laid great stress, has been explained as  consisting in the work of vicarious ordinances, including baptism for  the dead who have passed from earth without a knowledge of the gospel.  In teaching this doctrine, and in complying with its behests, the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands to-day alone  amongst all the sects professing Christianity.      [22] Mal. iv, 5-6.      [23] See page 11.      [24] Doc. & Cov. cx, 13-16.    =24.= The ancient scriptures are teeming with prophecies concerning  the restoration of Israel in the last days, and the gathering of the  chosen people from among the nations and from the lands into which  they have been led or driven as a penalty for their waywardness and  sin.[25] Such prominence and importance are attached to this work of  gathering, in the predictions of olden times, that from the days of  Israel's exodus, the last days have been characterized in sacred writ  as a gathering dispensation. The return of the tribes after their long  and wide dispersion is made a preliminary work to the establishment of  the predicted reign of righteousness with Christ on the throne of the  world; and its accomplishment is given as a sure precursor of the  millennium. Jerusalem is to be re-established as the City of the Great  King on the eastern Hemisphere; and Zion, or the New Jerusalem, is to  be built on the western continent; the Ten Tribes are to be brought  back from their hiding place in the north; and the curse is to be  removed from Israel.[26] From the early days of Joseph Smith's  ministry, he taught the doctrine of the gathering as imposing a  present duty upon the Church; and this phase of the Latter-day Saint  labor is one of its most characteristic features. Joseph Smith and  Oliver Cowdery declare that the authority for prosecuting this work  was committed to the Church through them by Moses, who held the keys  of authority as Israel's leader in former times. Their testimony is  thus stated, in the description given of manifestations in the  Kirtland Temple, April 3, 1836:--\"Moses appeared before us, and  committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four  parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of  the north.\"[27] As to the earnestness with which this labor has been  begun, and the fair progress already made therein, consider the  hundreds of thousands belonging to the families of Israel already  gathered in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains, about the house of the  Lord, now established; and hear the hymn of the chosen seed among the  nations, chanted to the accompaniment of effective deeds, \"Come, and  let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God  of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His  paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord  from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#5)"],[1,"fire from  lance-heads and helmets until I am dazzled. It turns the river  crimson--aye, it will be truly crimson before this day is done!    'The foe have reached the river. Now arrows fly between the hosts like  stinging clouds that hide the sun. Ha! Well loosed, bowmen! The  Bossonians have the better of it! Hark to them shout!'    Faintly in the ears of the king, above the din of trumpets and clanging  steel, came the deep fierce shout of the Bossonians as they drew and  loosed in perfect unison.    'Their archers seek to hold ours in play while their knights ride into  the river,' said the squire. 'The banks are not steep; they slope to the  water's edge. The knights come on, they crash through the willows. By  Mitra, the clothyard shafts find every crevice of their harness! Horses  and men go down, struggling and thrashing in the water. It is not deep,  nor is the current swift, but men are drowning there, dragged under by  their armor, and trampled by the frantic horses. Now the knights of  Aquilonia advance. They ride into the water and engage the knights of  Nemedia. The water swirls about their horses' bellies and the clang of  sword against sword is deafening.'    'Crom!' burst in agony from Conan's lips. Life was coursing sluggishly  back into his veins, but still he could not lift his mighty frame from  the dais.    'The wings close in,' said the squire. 'Pikemen and swordsmen fight hand  to hand in the stream, and behind them the bowmen ply their shafts.    'By Mitra, the Nemedian arbalesters are sorely harried, and the  Bossonians arch their arrows to drop amid the rear ranks. Their center  gains not a foot, and their wings are pushed back up from the stream  again.'    'Crom, Ymir, and Mitra!' raged Conan. 'Gods and devils, could I but  reach the fighting, if but to die at the first blow!'           *       *       *       *       *    Outside through the long hot day the battle stormed and thundered. The  valley shook to charge and counter-charge, to the whistling of shafts,  and the crash of rending shields and splintering lances. But the hosts  of Aquilonia held fast. Once they were forced back from the bank, but a  counter-charge, with the black banner flowing over the black stallion,  regained the lost ground. And like an iron rampart they held the right  bank of the stream, and at last the squire gave Conan the news that the  Nemedians were falling back from the river.    'Their wings are in confusion!' he cried. 'Their knights reel back from  the sword-play. But what is this? Your banner is in motion--the center  sweeps into the stream! By Mitra, Valannus is leading the host across  the river!'    'Fool!' groaned Conan. 'It may be a trick. He should hold his position;  by dawn Prospero will be here with the Poitanian levies.'    'The knights ride into a hail of arrows!' cried the squire. 'But they do  not falter! They sweep on--they have crossed! They charge up the slope!  Pallantides has hurled the wings across the river to their support! It  is all he can do. The lion banner dips and staggers above the melee.    'The knights of Nemedia make a stand. They are broken! They fall back!  Their left wing is in full flight, and our pikemen cut them down as they  run! I see Valannus, riding and smiting like a madman. He is carried  beyond himself by the fighting-lust. Men no longer look to Pallantides.  They follow Valannus, deeming him Conan as he rides with closed vizor.    'But look! There is method in his madness! He swings wide of the  Nemedian front, with five thousand knights, the pick of the army. The  main host of the Nemedians is in confusion--and look! Their flank is  protected by the cliffs, but there is a defile left unguarded! It is  like a great cleft in the wall that opens again behind the Nemedian  lines. By Mitra, Valannus sees and seizes the opportunity! He has driven  their wing before him, and he leads his knights toward that defile. They  swing wide of the main battle; they cut through a line of spearmen, they  charge into the defile!'    'An ambush!' cried Conan, striving to struggle upright.    '_No!_' shouted the squire exultantly. 'The whole Nemedian host is in  full sight! They have forgotten the defile! They never expected to be  pushed back that far. Oh, fool, fool, Tarascus, to make such a blunder!  Ah, I see lances and pennons pouring from the farther mouth of the  defile, beyond the Nemedian lines. They will smite those ranks from the  rear and crumple them. _Mitra, what is this?_'    He staggered as the walls of the tent swayed drunkenly. Afar over the  thunder of the fight rose a deep bellowing roar, indescribably ominous.    'The cliffs reel!' shrieked the squire. 'Ah, gods, what is this? The  river foams out of its channel, and the peaks are crumbling! The ground  shakes and horses and riders in armor are overthrown! The cliffs! The  cliffs are falling!'    With his words there came a grinding rumble and a thunderous concussion,  and the ground trembled. Over the roar of the battle sounded screams of  mad terror.    'The cliffs have crumbled!' cried the livid squire. 'They have thundered  down into the defile and crushed every living creature in it! I saw the  lion banner wave an instant amid the dust and falling stones, and then  it vanished! Ha, the Nemedians shout with triumph! Well may they shout,  for the fall of the cliffs has wiped out five thousand of our bravest  knights--Hark!'    To Conan's ears came a vast torrent of sound, rising and rising in  frenzy: 'The king is dead! _The king is dead! Flee! Flee! The king is  dead!_'    'Liars!' panted Conan. 'Dogs! Knaves! Cowards! Oh, Crom, if I could but  stand--but crawl to the river with my sword in my teeth! How, boy, do  they flee?'    'Aye!' sobbed the squire. 'They spur for the river; they are broken,  hurled on like spume before a storm. I see Pallantides striving to stem  the torrent--he is down, and the horses trample him! They rush into the  river, knights, bowmen, pikemen, all mixed and mingled in one mad  torrent of destruction. The Nemedians are on their heels, cutting them  down like corn.'    'But they will make a stand on this side of the river!' cried the king.  With an effort that brought the sweat dripping from his temples, he  heaved himself up on his elbows.    'Nay!' cried the squire. 'They cannot! They are broken! Routed! Oh gods,  that I should live to see this day!'    Then he remembered his duty and shouted to the men-at-arms who stood  stolidly watching the flight of their comrades. 'Get a horse, swiftly,  and help me lift the king upon it. We dare not bide here.'    But before they could do his bidding, the first drift of the storm was  upon them. Knights and spearmen and archers fled among the tents,  stumbling over ropes and baggage, and mingled with them were Nemedian  riders, who smote right and left at all alien figures. Tent-ropes were  cut, fire sprang up in a hundred places, and the plundering had already  begun. The grim guardsmen about Conan's tent died where they stood,  smiting and thrusting, and over their mangled corpses beat the hoofs of  the conquerors.    But the squire had drawn the flap close, and in the confused madness of  the slaughter none realized that the pavilion held an occupant. So the  flight and the pursuit swept past, and roared away up the valley, and  the squire looked out presently to see a cluster of men approaching the  royal tent with evident purpose.    'Here comes the king of Nemedia with four companions and his squire,'  quoth he. 'He will accept your surrender, my fair lord--'    'Surrender the devil's heart!' gritted the king.    He had forced himself up to a sitting posture. He swung his legs  painfully off the dais, and staggered upright, reeling drunkenly. The  squire ran to assist him, but Conan pushed him away.    'Give me that bow!' he gritted, indicating a longbow and quiver that  hung from a tent-pole.    'But your Majesty!' cried the squire in great perturbation. 'The battle  is lost! It were the part of majesty to yield with the dignity becoming  one of royal blood!'    'I have no royal blood,' ground Conan. 'I am a barbarian and the son of  a blacksmith.'    Wrenching away the bow and an arrow he staggered toward the opening of  the pavilion. So formidable was his appearance, naked but for short  leather breeks and sleeveless shirt, open to reveal his great, hairy  chest, with his huge limbs and his blue eyes blazing under his tangled  black mane, that the squire shrank back, more afraid of his king than of  the whole Nemedian host.    Reeling on wide-braced legs Conan drunkenly tore the door-flap open and  staggered out under the canopy. The king of Nemedia and his companions  had dismounted, and they halted short, staring in wonder at the  apparition confronting them.    'Here I am, you jackals!' roared the Cimmerian. 'I am the king! Death to  you, dog-brothers!'    He jerked the arrow to its head and loosed, and the shaft feathered  itself in the breast of the knight who stood beside Tarascus. Conan  hurled the bow at the king of Nemedia.    'Curse my shaky hand! Come in and take me if you dare!'    Reeling backward on unsteady legs, he fell with his shoulders against a  tent-pole, and propped upright, he lifted his great sword with both  hands.    'By Mitra, it _is_ the king!' swore Tarascus. He cast a swift look about  him, and laughed. 'That other was a jackal in his harness! In, dogs, and  take his head!'    The three soldiers--men-at-arms wearing the emblem of the royal  guards--rushed at the king, and one felled the squire with a blow of a  mace. The other two fared less well. As the first rushed in, lifting his  sword, Conan met him with a sweeping stroke that severed mail-links like  cloth, and sheared the Nemedian's arm and shoulder clean from his body.  His corpse, pitching backward, fell across his companion's legs. The man  stumbled, and before he could recover, the great sword was through him."]]]
