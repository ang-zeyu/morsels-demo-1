The belly is tightly fused laterally  with the belly of the _m. flexor hallucis longus_ and posteriorly with  the belly of the _m. flexor perforatus digiti IV_. The origin is by a  long, strong tendon from a small tubercle just medial to, and at the  proximal end of, the external condyle of the femur. Below the middle  of the crus this muscle terminates in a strong tendon which perforates  the tibial cartilage near its lateral edge. In this region the tendon  is sheathlike and wrapped around the tendon of the _m. flexor  perforatus digiti IV_. These two tendons together pass through the  posterolateral canal of the hypotarsus (Fig. 6). Immediately distal to  the hypotarsus the two tendons separate, and the tendon of the _m.  flexor perforatus digiti III_ receives a branch of the tendon of the  _m. peroneus longus_. The tendon passes distally over the surface of  the second trochlea, and its insertion is sheathlike on the posterior  surface of the first phalanx, and on the proximal end of the second.  In the area of insertion this tendon is perforated by that of the _m.  flexor perforans et perforatus digiti III_ and by that of the _m.  flexor digitorum longus_ to the third digit.    Action.--Flexes digit III.    Comparison.--In _Passer_, _Estrilda_, _Poephila_, _Hesperiphona_,  _Carpodacus_, _Pinicola_, _Leucosticte_, _Spinus_, and _Loxia_ the  edges of the sheathlike tendon are thickened at the points of  insertion, so that the tendon appears to have two branches which  insert along the posterolateral edges of the first phalanx and are  connected medially by a fascia.      _+Musculus flexor perforatus digiti IV+_ (Fig. 3).--Extending along  the posterior edge of the crus, this slender muscle lies beneath the  _m. gastrocnemius_. The belly is fused with those of the _m. flexor  hallucis longus_ and _m. flexor perforatus digiti III_. Its origin is  fleshy from the intercondyloid region of the distal end of the femur  and has a few fibers arising from the tendon of origin of the _m.  flexor perforatus digiti III_. Near the distal end of the crus the  muscle gives rise to the strong tendon of insertion which perforates  the tibial cartilage near its lateral edge and in this region is  ensheathed by the tendon of the _m. flexor perforatus digiti III_. The  two tendons pass together through the posterolateral canal of the  hypotarsus (Fig. 6). The tendon continues distally along the  tarsometatarsus and the posterior surface of digit IV. The tendon  bifurcates at approximately the middle of the first phalanx. A short  lateral branch inserts on the posterolateral edge of the proximal end  of the second phalanx. The long medial branch is perforated by a  branch of the _m. flexor digitorum longus_; the distal end is  flattened, has thickened edges, and inserts over the posterior  surfaces of the distal end of the second phalanx, and over the  proximal end of the third phalanx.    Action.--Flexes digit IV.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus flexor perforans et perforatus digiti II+_ (Figs. 2,  9).--Small and spindle-shaped, this muscle lies on the posterolateral  side of the crus immediately beneath the _pars externa_ of the _m.  gastrocnemius_. The origin is fleshy and arises in company with the  _m. flexor perforans et perforatus digiti III_ from a point on the  posterolateral surface of the distal end of the femur between the  point of origin of the _pars externa_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ and  the fibular condyle. The belly extends approximately one-fourth of the  way down the crus and gives rise to the tendon of insertion which  passes distally and superficially through the posterior edge of the  tibial cartilage. The tendon traverses the posteromedial canal of the  hypotarsus (Fig. 6) and continues along the posterior surface of the  tarsometatarsus. Between the first metatarsal and the base of the  second digit the tendon is enclosed by the medial surface of a  sesamoid bone. This tendon then perforates that of the _m. flexor  perforatus digiti II_ at the level of the first phalanx and in turn is  perforated by the tendon of the _m. flexor digitorum longus_ at the  proximal end of the second phalanx. The insertion is on the posterior  surface of the second phalanx.    Action.--Flexes digit II.    Comparison.--In _Passer_, _Estrilda_, _Poephila_, _Hesperiphona_,  _Carpodacus_, _Pinicola_, _Leucosticte_, _Spinus_, and _Loxia_ the  proximal portion of this muscle is more intimately connected with the  posterior edge of the _m. flexor perforans et perforatus digiti III_  than it is in the other species examined.      _+Musculus flexor perforans et perforatus digiti III+_ (Fig. 2).--Long  and pinnate, this muscle lies on the lateral surface of the crus  beneath the _m. peroneus longus_ and _pars externa_ of the _m.  gastrocnemius_. There are two distinct heads. The origin of the  anterior head is fleshy from the proximal edge of the outer cnemial  crest and from the internal edge of the distal end of the patellar  tendon. The posterior head arises by a tendon from the femur in  company with the _m. flexor perforans et perforatus digiti II_, is  connected also with the tendon of origin of the _m. flexor perforatus  digiti II_, and is loosely attached to the head of the fibula. Fibers  from the belly of the muscle attach throughout its length to the  lateral edge of the fibula, and the muscle is tightly fused also with  adjacent muscles. The tendon of insertion is formed approximately  one-half the way down the crus. The tendon perforates the posterior  surface of the tibial cartilage and passes through the posteromedial  canal of the hypotarsus (Fig. 6). At the base of the third digit the  tendon ensheathes that of the _m. flexor digitorum longus_ and the two  together perforate the tendon of the _m. flexor perforatus digiti  III_. Immediately distal to this perforation the tendon of the _m.  flexor perforans et perforatus digiti III_ ceases to ensheath that of  the _m. flexor digitorum longus_. The latter passes beneath that of  the former. Near the distal end of the second phalanx the tendon of  the _m. flexor digitorum longus_ perforates that of the _m. flexor  perforans et perforatus digiti III_. The latter inserts on the  posterior surface of the distal end of the second phalanx and the  proximal end of the third.    Action.--Flexes digit III.    Comparison.--In _Passer_, _Estrilda_, and _Poephila_, and in all the  cardueline finches examined the proximal portion of this muscle is  more intimately connected with the anterior edge of the _m. flexor  perforans et perforatus digiti II_ than it is in the other species  examined.      _+Musculus flexor digitorum longus+_ (Figs. 3, 5).--This strong,  pinnate muscle is deeply situated along the posterior surfaces of the  tibia and fibula. There are two distinct heads of origin. The lateral  head arises by means of fleshy fibers from the posterior edge of the  head of the fibula. The medial head arises by means of fleshy fibers  from the region under the ledgelike external and internal articular  surfaces of the proximal end of the tibia. Neither head has any  connection with the femur in contrast to the condition, described by  Hudson (1937: 46-47) in the crow, _Corvus brachyrhynchos_, and in the  raven, _Corvus corax_. Near the point of insertion of the _m. biceps  femoris_ the two heads fuse. The common belly is attached by fleshy  fibers to the posterior surface of the tibia and fibula for two-thirds  of the distance down the crus. Near the distal end of the crus the  muscle terminates in a strong tendon which passes deeply through the  tibial cartilage and traverses the anteromedial canal of the  hypotarsus (Fig. 6). About midway down the tarsometatarsus this tendon  becomes ossified. Immediately above the bases of the toes it gives  rise to three branches, one to the posterior surface of each of the  foretoes. These branches perforate the other flexor muscles of the  toes as described in the accounts of those muscles and insert as  follows: The branch to digit II inserts on the base of the ungual  phalanx and by a stout, tendinous slip on the distal end of the second  phalanx (Fig. 9). The branch to digit III inserts on the base of the  distal end of the third phalanx and a stronger slip to the distal end  of the second or proximal end of the third. The branch to digit IV  inserts on the base of the ungual phalanx, with one tendinous slip to  the distal end of the third phalanx and another to the distal end of  the fourth.    Action.--Flexes foretoes.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus flexor hallucis longus+_ (Fig. 3).--Situated immediately  posterior to the _m. flexor digitorum longus_, the belly of this  large, pinnate muscle is intimately connected anteriorly to that of  the _m. flexor perforatus digiti II_. The _m. flexor hallucis longus_  arises by two heads which are separated by the tendon of insertion of  the _m. biceps femoris_. The smaller anterior head arises from the  same tendon as does the _m. flexor perforatus digiti II_. The larger  posterior head arises by means of fleshy fibers from the  intercondyloid region of the posterior surface of the femur along with  the _m. flexor perforatus digiti III_ and _IV_. The two heads join  just distal to the point of insertion of the _m. biceps femoris_.  There is no trace of a tendinous band connecting the two heads as  there is in the crow and in the raven (Hudson, 1937:49). Near the  distal end of the shank the muscle gives rise to a strong tendon which  perforates the tibial cartilage along its lateral edge and passes  through the anterolateral canal of the hypotarsus (Fig. 6). The tendon  crosses"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33915"],[0,"Mammals taken Along the Alaska Highway (#5)"],[1," the junction of the Liard River and Irons Creek  in British Columbia.    Lacking sufficient comparative material in the past, most workers have  considered that _M. pennsylvanicus_ ranges without appreciable  geographic variation throughout most of northwestern Canada and  Alaska, where it has been referred to the subspecies, _M. p.  drummondii_. Dale (1940), in studying collections made in British  Columbia and southeastern Alaska, found evidence of geographic  variation and recognized two new subspecies; thus he not only pointed  out geographically variable characters but reduced the size of the  range ascribed to _M. p. drummondii_. A later work by Rand (1943)  considered the northwestern populations of _M. pennsylvanicus_ as  being too variable to show distinctive groupings. The large collection  made by Alcorn offers evidence that other separable subspecies with  constant characters are present. Study of this material indicates the  presence of two unnamed subspecies, which are named and described as  follows:      Microtus pennsylvanicus alcorni new subspecies    _Type._--Female, adult, skin with skull, No. 21552, Univ. Kansas, Mus.  Nat. Hist., 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 feet elevation, Yukon Territory,  Canada; 24 August 1947; obtained by J. R. Alcorn; original No. 5240.    _Range._--Extreme southwestern Yukon Territory and adjacent parts of  Alaska as far south as Haines, as far north as Northway, and as far  west along the Alaskan coast as Anchorage and Tyonek.    _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); color of upper parts near  (_l_) Brussels Brown; skull noticeably ridged; zygomatic arches heavy,  rounded and relatively short; rostrum heavy; auditory bullae not  greatly expanded; maxillary teeth relatively heavy and low-crowned.    _Comparisons._--From _M. p. drummondii_ (specimens from vicinity of  Whitehorse, Y. T., Trutch, B. C., and Kinuso, Alberta), _M. p.  alcorni_ differs as follows: Averaging larger in all measurements  taken except lengths of tail and hind foot, which are the same; color  of upper parts slightly paler and more gray and less brown; underparts  paler; zygomatic arches heavier, rounder and shorter; skull  proportionately more massive, except the auditory bullae which are  less inflated; maxillary teeth heavier and lower-crowned.    From _M. p. rubidus_ (specimens from Atlin, B. C.), _M. p. alcorni_  differs as follows: Averaging larger in all cranial measurements taken  except length of the maxillary tooth-row which is the same; color of  upperparts more gray and less brown; underparts darker; skull longer  with longer nasals and heavier zygomatic arches; skull of adult more  heavily ridged.    From _M. p. admiraltiae_ (specimens from Admiralty Island), _M. p.  alcorni_ differs as follows: Averaging larger in all measurements  taken; color of upper parts more gray and less brown, underparts  darker.    _Remarks._--_Microtus p. alcorni_ is a well-defined subspecies  differing markedly from adjacent subspecies by a larger and heavier  skull and broader, more rounded and heavier zygomatic arches.  Characters examined in the specimens available are constant. Specimens  from Haines are slightly darker than those from Kluane. An adult (No.  21534, UKMNH) from Northway has slightly more inflated auditory bullae  than those from Kluane. An adult from Tyonek (No. 986, UKMNH) has  richer brown upper parts. Measurements of this specimen resemble  closely those of animals from Kluane, although the rostrum is  noticably heavier.    Several adults were available from many of the localities of  occurrence of _M. p. alcorni_. At the locality 9 miles west and 4  miles north of Haines, there were four which were considered to be old  adults. These four had larger measurements than others considered to  be fully adult. In addition, the skulls were larger and more rugged.  There were occasionally old adults in other series. For the sake of  uniformity, I have not considered these aforementioned old adults in  the comparative studies of younger adults. This subspecies is named in  honor of J(oseph). R(aymond). Alcorn, the collector.    _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of six adults of  both sexes of _M. p. alcorni_ from the type locality are as follows:  Total length, 162 (149-172); length of tail, 43 (39-45); condylobasal  length, 26.3 (25.6-26.3); basal length, 25.2 (24.2-25.9); length of  nasals, 7.3 (6.9-7.5); zygomatic breadth, 15.3 (14.9-15.6); breadth  across auditory bullae, 12.8 (12.4-13.2); alveolar length of upper  molariform tooth-row, 6.4 (6.1-6.7). Seven adults of both sexes from 9  miles west and 4 miles north of Haines have the following  measurements: 158 (148-165); 45 (41-50); 26.1 (25.5-26.8); 24.8  (24.4-25.7); 7.3 (7.0-7.6); 14.9 (14.3-15.1); 12.2 (11.8-13.0); 6.2  (5.9-6.3).    _Specimens examined._--Total 65, distributed by localities of capture  as follows and deposited in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural  History: _Alaska_: E side Deadman Lake, 1800 ft., 15 mi. SE Northway,  7; 1 mi. NE Anchorage, 100 ft., 1; Tyonek, Cook's Inlet, 1; E side  Chilkat River, 100 ft., 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines, 37. _Yukon  Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2250 ft., 14; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 2;  11/2 mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 3. Specimens reported by  Osgood (1904:35) have not been seen by me but may be of this  subspecies, and are tentatively referred to it. These are from the  following localities in Alaska: Lake Clark near Keejik, near the mouth  of the Chulitna River, and Kakhtul River near the junction with the  Malchatna.      Microtus pennsylvanicus tananaensis new subspecies    _Type._--Female, adult, skin with skull, No. 21509, Univ. Kansas, Mus.  Nat. Hist., Yerrick Creek, 21 mi. W and 4 mi. N Tok Junction, Alaska;  20 July 1947; obtained by J. R. Alcorn; original No. 5023.    _Range._--East-central Alaska as far south as Tok Junction, as far  west as Mt. McKinley, as far north as Fairbanks and as far east as  Eagle.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements); color of upper parts  dark, near (_n_) Prout's Brown, with some individual variation; skull  with zygomatic arches moderately heavy and wide; nasals relatively  long; auditory bullae inflated.    _Comparisons._--From _M. p. alcorni_ (see description), _M. p.  tananaensis_ differs as follows: Smaller in all measurements taken  except alveolar length of upper molariform tooth-row which is the  same; color of upper parts darker, more richly brown and less gray;  underparts darker; zygomatic arches less massive and narrower;  auditory bullae larger and more inflated.    From _M. p. drummondii_ (see comparisons under _M. p. alcorni_), _M.  p. tananaensis_ differs as follows: Larger in all cranial measurements  taken except nasal length which is the same; color everywhere slightly  darker; wider across zygomatic arches; zygoma thicker; nasals,  relative to length of skull, shorter; auditory bullae larger and more  inflated.    _Remarks._--For the most part the material available of this  subspecies consisted of subadults; however, comparison of adults with  those of adjacent subspecies indicates that this subspecies can be  distinguished by color of the upper parts, cranial measurements, and  size of the zygomatic arches and the auditory bullae. Specimens from  14 miles east and 25 miles north of Fairbanks are especially dark. One  subadult (No. 21467, UKMNH) has blackish hair on the feet and a  blackish unicolored tail. No. 241696, USBS, an old adult female, from  Ketchumstock, is larger.    The specimens referred to this subspecies, vary some in color, but  vary less in cranial characters. Additional adults are needed from  western Alaska to determine how far this subspecies extends down the  valley of the Yukon River. Bailey (1900:24) lists one specimen from  Nulato, as _drummondii_; I have not seen it but on geographic grounds  tentatively assign it to _M. p. tananaensis_.    _Measurements._--Measurements of the type specimen are as follows:  Total length, 160; length of tail, 40; condylobasal length, 26.0;  basal length, 24.9; length of nasals, 6.7; zygomatic breadth, 14.5;  breadth across auditory bullae, 12.5; alveolar length of upper  molariform tooth-row, 6.2. Two specimens from Eagle (Nos. 128295 and  128320, USBS) have the following measurements respectively: 161, 154;  37.5, 36; 25.3, 25.4; 23.8, 23.9; 6.5, 6.8; 14.5, 14.6; 11.9, 12.3;  6.1, 6.1.    _Specimens examined._--Total 34, distributed by localities of capture  as follows and unless otherwise stated in the University of Kansas  Museum of Natural History: _Alaska_: Near Buster Creek, Chatanika  River, 1 (USBS); Chatanika River, 700 ft., 14 mi. E and 25 mi. N  Fairbanks, 4; Fairbanks, 2 (USBS); head of Glacier Creek, Mt.  McKinley, 1 (USBS); Moose Creek, Mt. McKinley, 2 (USBS); head of  Toklat River, 1 (USBS); Eagle, 4 (USBS); Yerrick Creek, 21 mi. W and 4  mi. N Tok Junction, 13; Ketchumstock, 2 (USBS); 9 mi. from mouth of  Robertson River, 1 (USBS); Tanana, 3 (USBS); Tanana Crossing, 1  (USBS). Osgood (1909b:24) records specimens which may be of this  subspecies from the following localities in Alaska: Charlie Creek,  Circle, 20 miles above Circle, 40 miles above Circle, Nation Creek,  and Seventy Mile Creek. Osgood (1900:36) also records specimens from  near Fort Yukon. None of these has been seen by me; they are only  tentatively assigned to this subspecies.
