If the work is  carried out with care, it is possible to obtain the bulb in two halves  as shown by _d_, and these two halves will correspond so exactly that  when the cut edges are placed in contact they will be almost air-tight.  The two tubes from the smaller bulb should be cut to such a length that  they will just rest inside the larger, and the ends should be expanded.  Place the inner bulb in position and fit the two halves of the outer  bulb together, taking great care not to chip the edges. If the length of  the tubes on the inner bulb has been adjusted properly, the inner bulb  will be supported in position by their contact with the tubes on the  outer bulb. Now rotate the cracked portion of the outer bulb in front  of a blowpipe flame and press the halves together very gently as the  glass softens. Expand slightly by blowing if necessary. If a small  pin-hole develops at the joint it is sometimes possible to close this  with a bead of hot glass; but if the bulb has been cut properly there  should be no pin-holes formed. The condenser is finished by joining on  the side tubes and sealing the inner tube through by the methods already  given. In order to blow bulbs large enough to make a useful condenser,  it will be convenient to employ the multiple-jet blowpipe described on  page 4.    _A Soxhlet-Tube or Extraction Apparatus._--This involves the  construction of a re-entrant join where the syphon flows into the lower  tube. It is of considerable value as an exercise and the complete  apparatus is easy to make.    A large tube is sealed at the bottom and the top is lipped, as in making  a test-tube. A smaller tube is then joined on by a method similar to  that given on page 18, but without making a perforation in the bottom of  the large tube. Heating and expanding by air pressure, first through the  large tube, then through the smaller tube and then again through the  large tube, will give a satisfactory finish to this part of the work.    [Illustration: Fig. 11]    The syphon tube is now joined on to the large tube as shown by _a_, Fig.  11, care being taken to seal the other end of the syphon tube before  joining. The details of the final and re-entrant joint of the syphon  tube are shown at the lower part of _a_. This join is made by expanding  the sealed end of the syphon tube into a small, thick-walled bulb, and  the bottom of this bulb is burst out by local heating and blowing; the  fragments of glass are removed and the edges made smooth by melting. A  similar operation is carried out on the side of the tube to which the  syphon tube is to be joined. This stage is shown by _a_. Now heat the  syphon tube at the upper bend until it is flexible, and press the bulb  at its end into the opening on the side of the other tube. Hold the  glass thus until the syphon is no longer flexible. The final join is  made by heating the two contacting surfaces, if necessary pressing the  edges in contact with the end of a turn-pin, fusing together and  expanding. The finished apparatus is shown by _c_.    _Electrodes._--A thin platinum wire may be sealed into a capillary tube  without any special precautions being necessary. The capillary tube may  be drawn out from the side of a larger tube by heating a spot on the  glass, touching with a glass rod and drawing the rod away; or the  exhaustion branch described on page 18 may be used for the introduction  of an electrode. It is convenient sometimes to carry out the exhaustion  through the same tube that will afterwards serve for the electrode. The  electrode wire is laid inside the branch before connecting to the  exhaustion pump. When exhaustion is completed the tube is heated until  the soft glass flows round the platinum and makes the seal air-tight.  The branch is now cut off close to the seal on the pump side, a loop is  made in the projecting end of the platinum wire, and the seal is  finished by melting the cut-off end.    Platinum is usually employed for such work, but if care is taken to  avoid oxidation it is not impossible to make fairly satisfactory seals  with clean iron or nickel wire. Hard rods of fine graphite, such as are  used in some pencils, may also be sealed into glass, but it seems  probable that air would diffuse through the graphite in the course of  time.    Another method for the introduction of an electrode is illustrated by  _d_, _e_, _f_ and _g_, Fig. 11. In this case the bulb or thin-walled  tube into which the electrode is to be sealed is perforated by a quick  stab with an intensely heated wire--preferably of platinum--which is  then withdrawn before the glass has had time to harden, and thus a  minute circular hole is made. The electrode is coated with a layer of  similar glass, or of the specially made enamel which is sold for this  purpose, inserted into the bulb or tube by any convenient opening, and  adjusted by careful shaking until the platinum wire projects through the  small hole. The bulb or tube is then fused to the coating of the  electrode and the whole spot expanded slightly by blowing. The  appearance of the finished seal is shown by _g_. It is well to anneal  slightly by smoking.    _Thermometers._--Apart from the notes on page 20 with respect to the  blowing of a suitable bulb on capillary tubing there is little to say in  connection with the glass working needed in making a plain thermometer.  The size desirable for the bulb will be determined by the bore of the  capillary tube, the coefficient of expansion of the liquid used for  filling, and the range of temperature for which the thermometer is  intended.    Filling may be carried out as follows:--Fit a small funnel to the open  end of the capillary by means of a rubber tube, and pour into the funnel  rather more than enough of the liquid to be used than is required to  fill the bulb. Mercury or alcohol will be used in practice, most  probably. Warm the bulb until a few air bubbles have escaped through  the liquid and then allow to cool. This will suck a certain amount of  liquid into the bulb. Now heat the bulb again, and at the same time heat  the capillary tube over a second burner. The liquid will boil and sweep  out the residual air, but it is necessary to heat the capillary tube as  well in order to prevent condensation. Allow the bulb and tube to cool,  then repeat the heating once more. By this time the bulb and tube should  be free from air, and cooling should give a completely filled  thermometer. Remove the funnel and heat the thermometer to a few degrees  above the maximum temperature for which it is to be used; the mercury or  other filling liquid will overflow from the top, and, as the temperature  falls, will recede, thus allowing the end of the capillary to be drawn  out. Reheat again until the liquid rises to the top of the tube, then  seal by means of the blowpipe flame. The thermometer is now finished  except for graduation; this is dealt with on page 75.    _An Alarm Thermometer._--A thermometer which will complete an electric  circuit when a certain temperature is reached may be made by sealing an  electrode in the bulb and introducing a wire into the top, which in this  case is not sealed. Naturally, this thermometer will be filled with  mercury. There is considerable difficulty in filling such a bulb without  causing it to crack.    Several elaborations of this form are made, in which electrodes are  sealed through the walls of the capillary tube, thus making it possible  to detect electrically the variation of temperature when it exceeds any  given limits.    _An Enclosed or Floating Thermometer._--The construction of this type of  thermometer is shown by _h_ and _i_, Fig 11. It is made in the following  stages:--A bulb is blown on the drawn-out end of a thin-walled tube as  shown by _h_. A small bulb is blown on the end of a capillary tube,  burst, and turned out to form a lip which will rest in the drawn-out  part of the thin-walled tube but is just too large to enter the bulb.  The capillary tube is introduced and sealed in position, care being  taken to expand the joint a little. The thermometer is filled and the  top of the capillary tube closed by the use of a small blowpipe flame. A  paper scale having the necessary graduations is inserted, and the top  of the outer tube is closed as shown by _i_.    _A Maximum and Minimum Thermometer._--If a small dumb-bell-shaped rod of  glass or metal is introduced into the capillary tube of a horizontally  placed, mercury-filled thermometer in such a position that the rising  mercury column will come in contact with it, the rod will be pushed  forward. When the mercury falls again the rod will be left behind and  thus indicate the maximum temperature attained. If a similar  dumb-bell-shaped rod is introduced into an alcohol-filled thermometer  and pushed down until it is within the alcohol column, it will be drawn  down by surface tension as the column falls; but the rising column will  flow passed it without causing any displacement; thus the minimum  temperature will be recorded.    Six's combined maximum and minimum thermometer is shown by _b_, Fig. 11.  In this case both maximum and minimum records are obtained from a  mercury column, although the thermometer bulb is filled with alcohol. It  is an advantage to make the dumb-bell-shaped rods of iron, as the  thermometer can then be reset by the use of a small magnet, another  advantage consequent on the use of metal being that the rods can be  easily adjusted, by slight bending, so as to remain stationary in the  tubes when the thermometer is hanging vertically, and yet to move with  sufficient freedom to yield to the pressure of the recording column.    The thermometer may be filled by the following method:--When the  straight tube has been made the first dumb-bell is introduced and shaken  down well towards the lower bulb, the tube is now bent to its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32974"],[0,"The Elements of Blowpipe Analysis (#5)"],[1,"l.         2.
