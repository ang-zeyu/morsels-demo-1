Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all  interested in him, although they have had very little communication with  him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant  and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been  a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so  attractive and amiable.    I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no  friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit  had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as  the brother of my heart.    I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should  I have any fresh incidents to record.      August 13th, 17--.    My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my  admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble  a creature destroyed by misery, without feeling the most poignant grief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he  speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they  flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.    He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the  deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet,  although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but  that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has  frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him  without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour  of my eventual success, and into every minute detail of the measures I  had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he  evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance to the  burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed  me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every  hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were  but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I  sought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the  elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my  listener's countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress  his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered  and failed me, as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his  fingers,--a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused;--at length he  spoke, in broken accents:--\"Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have  you drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,--let me reveal my  tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!\"    Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the  paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened  powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were  necessary to restore his composure.    Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise  himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of  despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He  asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told:  but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of  finding a friend--of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a  fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction  that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this  blessing.    \"I agree with you,\" replied the stranger; \"we are unfashioned creatures,  but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--such a  friend ought to be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and  faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures,  and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have  hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I--I  have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.\"    As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled  grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently  retired to his cabin.    Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does  the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight  afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of  elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may  suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has  retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a  halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.    Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine  wanderer? You would not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and  refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore,  somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to  appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I  have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses, that  elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I  believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but never-failing  power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled  for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression, and a  voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.      August 19. 17--.    Yesterday the stranger said to me, \"You may easily perceive, Captain  Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had  determined, at one time, that the memory of these evils should die with  me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for  knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the  gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine  has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful  to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course,  exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am,  I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may  direct you if you succeed in your undertaking, and console you in case  of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed  marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature, I might fear to  encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will  appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would  provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers  of nature:--nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series  internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.\"    You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered  communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by  a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the  promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong  desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these  feelings in my answer.    \"I thank you,\" he replied, \"for your sympathy, but it is useless; my  fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall  repose in peace. I understand your feeling,\" continued he, perceiving  that I wished to interrupt him; \"but you are mistaken, my friend, if  thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen  to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.\"    He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when  I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I  have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my  duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has  related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make  notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure:  but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what  interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I  commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous  eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin  hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are  irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story;  frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and  wrecked it--thus!          CHAPTER I.      I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished  of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and  syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour  and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity  and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger  days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of  circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the  decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.    As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot  refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a  merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous  mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a  proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty  and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been  distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,  therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter  to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My  father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved  by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4248"],[0,"The Problem of the Ohio Mounds (#5)"],[1,"ifices. Moreover, judging  from all the data in our possession, the weight of evidence seems  to be decidedly against such conclusion.    Among the Indians fire appears to have been connected with the  mortuary ceremonies in several ways. One use of it was to burn the  flesh and softer portions of the body when removed from the bones.  [Footnote: Barnard Romans, Nat. Hist. Florida, p. 90.] Breboeuf  also mentions its use in connection with the communal burial of  the Hurons. [Footnote: Jesuit Relations for 1636, p. 135.]  According to M. B. Kent [Footnote: Yarrow's Mort. Customs N. A.  Indians, 1st Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethnology (1881), P. 95.] it was the  ancient custom of the Sacs and Foxes to burn a portion of the food  of the burial feast to furnish subsistence for the spirit on its  journey.    Pickett says [Footnote: Hist. Alabama, 3d ed., vol. 1, p. 140.]  the Choctaws were in the habit of killing and cutting up their  prisoners of war, after which the parts were burned. He adds  further, in reference to their burial ceremonies: [Footnote:  Ibid., p. 142] \"From all we have heard and read of the Choctaws,  we are satisfied that it was their custom to take from the bone-  house the skeletons, with which they repaired in funeral  procession to the suburbs of the town, where they placed them on  the ground in one heap, together with the property of the dead,  such as pots, bows, arrows, ornaments, curiously-shaped stones for  dressing deer skins, and a variety of other things. Over this heap  they first threw charcoal and ashes, probably to preserve the  bones, and the next operation was to cover all with earth. This  left a mound several feet high.\" This furnishes a complete  explanation of the fact that uncharred human bones are frequently  found in Southern mounds imbedded in charcoal and ashes.    Similarity of their stone implements and ornaments.--In addition  to the special points of resemblance between the works of the two  peoples, of which a few only have been mentioned, we are warranted  in asserting that in all respects, so far as we can trace them  correctly, there are to be found strong resemblances between the  habits, customs, and arts of the mound-builders and those of the  Indians previous to their change by contact with Europeans. Both  made use of stone implements, and so precisely similar are the  articles of this class that it is impossible to distinguish those  made by the one people from those made by the other. So true is  this that our best and most experienced archaeologists make no  attempt to separate them, except where the conditions under which  they are found furnish evidence for discrimination. Instead of  burdening these pages with proofs of these statements by reference  to particular finds and authorities, I call attention to the work  of Dr. C. C. Abbott on the handiwork in stone, bone, and clay of  the native races of the northern Atlantic sea board of America,  entitled \"Primitive Industry.\" As the area embraced in this work,  as remarked by its author, \"does not include any territory known  to have been permanently occupied by the so-called mound-  builders,\" the articles found here must be ascribed to the Indians  unless, as suggested by Dr. Abbott, some of a more primitive type  found in the Trenton gravel are to be attributed to an earlier and  still ruder people. Examining those of the first class, which are  ascribed to the Indians, we observe almost every type of stone  articles found in the mounds and mound area; not only the rudely  chipped scrapers, hoes, celts, knives, and spear and arrow heads,  but also the polished or ground celts, axes, hammers, and chisels,  or gouges.    Here we also find drills, awls, and perforators, slick stones and  dressers, pipes of various forms and finish, discoidal stones and  net sinkers, butterflys tones and other supposed ceremonial  objects, masks or face figures and bird-shaped stones, gorgets,  totems, pendants, trinkets, etc. Nor does the resemblance stop  with types, but it is carried down to specific forms and finish,  leaving absolutely no possible line of demarkation between these  and the similar articles attributed to the mound-builders. So  persistently true is this that had we stone articles alone to  judge by, it is probable we should be forced to the conclusion, as  held by some writers, that the former inhabitants of that portion  of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains pertained to one  nation, unless possibly the prevalence of certain types in  particular sections should afford some data for tribal  districting.    This strong similarity of the stone articles of the Atlantic coast  to those of the mound area was noticed as early as 1820 by Caleb  Atwater, who, knowing that the former were Indian manufactures,  attributed the latter also to the same people although he held  that the mounds were the work of the ancestors of the civilized  nations of Mexico and Central America.    Mound and Indian Pottery.--The pottery of the mound-builders has  often been referred to as proof of a higher culture status, and of  an advance in art beyond that reached by the Indians. The vase  with a bird figure found by Squier and Davis in an Ohio mound is  presented in most works on American archaeology as an evidence of  the advanced stage of the ceramic art among the mound-builders;  but Dr. Rau, who examined the collection of these authors, says:    Having seen the best specimens of \"mound\" pottery obtained during  the survey of Messrs. Squier and Davis, I do not hesitate to  assert that the clay vessels fabricated at the Cahokia Creek were  in every respect equal to those exhumed from the mounds of the  Mississippi Valley, and Dr. Davis himself, who examined my  specimens from the first-named locality, expressed the same  opinion. [Footnote: Smithsonian Rept., 1866, p. 349.]    The Cahokia pottery which he found along the creek of that name  (Madison County, Ill.) he ascribes to Indians, and believes it to  be of comparatively recent origin.    Most of the mound pottery is mixed with pulverized shells, which  is also true of most Indian pottery. [Footnote: Dumont, Mem. Hist.  La., vol. 2, 1753, p. 271; Adair, Hist. Am. Indians, p. 424;  Loskiel, Gesell. der Miss., p. 70, etc.] Du Pratz says that \"the  Natchez Indians make pots of an extraordinary size, cruses with a  medium-sized opening, jars, bottles with long necks holding two  pints, and pots or cruses for holding bear's oil;\" [Footnote:  Hist. La., p. 79.] also that they colored them a beautiful red by  using ocher, which becomes red after burning.    As is well known, the bottle-shaped vase with a long neck is the  typical form of clay vessels found in the mounds of Arkansas and  southeastern Missouri, and is also common in the mounds and stone  graves of middle Tennessee. Those colored or ornamented with red  are often found in the mounds of the former sections. It is worthy  of notice in this connection that the two localities--near Saint  Genevieve, Mo., and near Shawneetown, Ill.--where so many  fragments of large clay vessels used in making salt have been  found, were occupied for a considerable time by the Shawnee  Indians. As will hereafter be shown, there are reasons for  believing this pottery was made by the Shawnees.    The statement so often made that the mound pottery, especially  that of Ohio, far excels that of the Indians is not justified by  the facts.    Much more evidence of like tenor might be presented here, as, for  example, the numerous instances in which articles of European  manufacture have been found in mounds where their presence could  not be attributed to intrusive burials, but the limits of the  paper will not admit of this. I turn, therefore, to the problem  before us, viz, \"Who were the authors of the typical works of  Ohio?\"    As before stated, the answer is, \"These works are attributable in  part at least to the ancestors of the modern Cherokees.\"    As a connecting link between what has been given and the direct  evidence that the Cherokees were mound-builders, and as having an  important bearing upon both questions, the evidence derived from  the box-shaped stone graves is introduced at this point.            CHAPTER III.    STONE GRAVES AND WHAT THEY TEACH.      In order to state clearly the argument based upon these works it  is necessary to present a brief explanation.    There are several forms and varieties of stone graves or cists  found in the mound area, some being of cobble stones, others of  slabs; some round, others polygonal; some dome-shaped, others  square, and others box shaped, or parallelograms. Reference is  made at present only to the last mentioned--the box shaped type,  made of stone slabs. If the evidence shows that this variety is  found only in certain districts, pertains to a certain class of  works, and is usually accompanied by certain types of art, we are  warranted in using it as an ethnic characteristic, or as  indicating the presence of particular tribes. If it can be shown  that graves of this form are found in mounds attributed to the so-  called mound-builders, and that certain tribes of Indians of  historic times were also accustomed to bury in them, we are  warranted in assuming that there was a continuity of custom from  the mound-building age to historic times, or that graves found in  the mounds are probably attributable to the same people (or allied  tribes) found using them at a later date. This conclusion will be  strengthened by finding that certain peculiar types of art are  limited to the regions where these graves exist, and are found  almost exclusively in connection with them.    These graves, as is well known, are formed of rough and unhewn  slabs or flat pieces of stone, thus: First, in a pit some 2 or 3  feet deep and of the desired dimensions, dug for the purpose, a  layer of stone is placed to form the floor; next, similar pieces  are set on edge to form the sides and"]]]
