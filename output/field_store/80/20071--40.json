I will stab myself with this  knife and join my daughter in the land of spirits.\"    Her husband and relatives tried to get the knife from her, but could  not. They feared to use force lest she kill herself. They came together  to see what they could do.    \"We must get the knife away from her,\" they said.    At last they called a boy, a kind of simpleton, yet with a good deal of  natural shrewdness. He was an orphan and very poor. His moccasins were  out at the sole and he was dressed in wei-zi (coarse buffalo skin,  smoked).    \"Go to the tepee of the mourning mother,\" they told the simpleton, \"and  in some way contrive to make her laugh and forget her grief. Then try to  get the knife away from her.\"    The boy went to the tent and sat down at the door as if waiting to be  given something. The corpse lay in the place of honor where the dead  girl had slept in life. The body was wrapped in a rich robe and wrapped  about with ropes. Friends had covered it with rich offerings out of  respect to the dead.    As the mother sat on the ground with her head covered she did not at  first see the boy, who sat silent. But when his reserve had worn away  a little he began at first lightly, then more heavily, to drum on the  floor with his hands. After a while he began to sing a comic song.  Louder and louder he sang until carried away with his own singing he  sprang up and began to dance, at the same time gesturing and making all  manner of contortions with his body, still singing the comic song. As he  approached the corpse he waved his hands over it in blessing. The mother  put her head out of the blanket and when she saw the poor simpleton  with his strange grimaces trying to do honor to the corpse by his solemn  waving, and at the same time keeping up his comic song, she burst out  laughing. Then she reached over and handed her knife to the simpleton.    \"Take this knife,\" she said. \"You have taught me to forget my grief. If  while I mourn for the dead I can still be mirthful, there is no reason  for me to despair. I no longer care to die. I will live for my husband.\"    The simpleton left the tepee and brought the knife to the astonished  husband and relatives.    \"How did you get it? Did you force it away from her, or did you steal  it?\" they said.    \"She gave it to me. How could I force it from her or steal it when she  held it in her hand, blade uppermost? I sang and danced for her and she  burst out laughing. Then she gave it to me,\" he answered.    When the old men of the village heard the orphan's story they were very  silent. It was a strange thing for a lad to dance in a tepee where there  was mourning. It was stranger that a mother should laugh in a tepee  before the corpse of her dead daughter. The old men gathered at last in  a council. They sat a long time without saying anything, for they did  not want to decide hastily. The pipe was filled and passed many times.  At last an old man spoke.    \"We have a hard question. A mother has laughed before the corpse of her  daughter, and many think she has done foolishly, but I think the woman  did wisely. The lad was simple and of no training, and we cannot expect  him to know how to do as well as one with good home and parents to teach  him. Besides, he did the best that he knew. He danced to make the mother  forget her grief, and he tried to honor the corpse by waving over it his  hands.\"    \"The mother did right to laugh, for when one does try to do us good,  even if what he does causes us discomfort, we should always remember  rather the motive than the deed. And besides, the simpleton's dancing  saved the woman's life, for she gave up her knife. In this, too, she did  well, for it is always better to live for the living than to die for the  dead.\"            A LITTLE BRAVE AND THE MEDICINE WOMAN    A village of Indians moved out of winter camp and pitched their tents  in a circle on high land overlooking a lake. A little way down the  declivity was a grave. Choke cherries had grown up, hiding the grave  from view. But as the ground had sunk somewhat, the grave was marked by  a slight hollow.    One of the villagers going out to hunt took a short cut through the  choke cherry bushes. As he pushed them aside he saw the hollow grave,  but thought it was a washout made by the rains. But as he essayed to  step over it, to his great surprise he stumbled and fell. Made curious  by his mishap, he drew back and tried again; but again he fell. When he  came back to the village he told the old men what had happened to him.  They remembered then that a long time before there had been buried there  a medicine woman or conjurer. Doubtless it was her medicine that made  him stumble.    The story of the villager's adventure spread thru the camp and made many  curious to see the grave. Among others were six little boys who were,  however, rather timid, for they were in great awe of the dead medicine  woman. But they had a little playmate named Brave, a mischievous little  rogue, whose hair was always unkempt and tossed about and who was never  quiet for a moment.    \"Let us ask Brave to go with us,\" they said; and they went in a body to  see him.    \"All right,\" said Brave; \"I will go with you. But I have something to  do first. You go on around the hill _that_ way, and I will hasten around  _this_ way, and meet you a little later near the grave.\"    So the six little boys went on as bidden until they came to a place near  the grave. There they halted.    \"Where is Brave?\" they asked.    Now Brave, full of mischief, had thought to play a jest on his little  friends. As soon as they were well out of sight he had sped around the  hill to the shore of the lake and sticking his hands in the mud had  rubbed it over his face, plastered it in his hair, and soiled his hands  until he looked like a new risen corpse with the flesh rotting from his  bones. He then went and lay down in the grave and awaited the boys.    When the six little boys came they were more timid than ever when they  did not find Brave; but they feared to go back to the village without  seeing the grave, for fear the old men would call them cowards.    So they slowly approached the grave and one of them timidly called out:    \"Please, grandmother, we won't disturb your grave. We only want to see  where you lie. Don't be angry.\"    At once a thin quavering voice, like an old woman's, called out:    \"Han, han, takoja, hechetuya, hechetuya! Yes, yes, that's right, that's  right.\"    The boys were frightened out of their senses, believing the old woman  had come to life.    \"Oh, grandmother,\" they gasped, \"don't hurt us; please don't, we'll go.\"    Just then Brave raised his muddy face and hands up thru the choke cherry  bushes. With the oozy mud dripping from his features he looked like some  very witch just raised from the grave. The boys screamed outright. One  fainted. The rest ran yelling up the hill to the village, where each  broke at once for his mother's tepee.    As all the tents in a Dakota camping circle face the center, the boys as  they came tearing into camp were in plain view from the tepees. Hearing  the screaming, every woman in camp ran to her tepee door to see what  had happened. Just then little Brave, as badly scared as the rest, came  rushing in after them, his hair on end and covered with mud and crying  out, all forgetful of his appearance:    \"It's me, it's me!\"    The women yelped and bolted in terror from the village. Brave dashed  into his mother's tepee, scaring her out of her wits. Dropping pots and  kettles, she tumbled out of the tent to run screaming with the rest. Nor  would a single villager come near poor little Brave until he had gone  down to the lake and washed himself.              THE BOUND CHILDREN    There once lived a widow with two children--the elder a daughter and the  younger a son. The widow went in mourning for her husband a long time.  She cut off her hair, let her dress lie untidy on her body and kept her  face unpainted and unwashed.    There lived in the same village a great chief. He had one son just come  old enough to marry. The chief had it known that he wished his son to  take a wife, and all of the young women in the village were eager to  marry the young man. However, he was pleased with none of them.    Now the widow thought, \"I am tired of mourning for my husband and caring  for my children. Perhaps if I lay aside my mourning and paint myself  red, the chief's son may marry me.\"    So she slipped away from her two children, stole down to the river and  made a bathing place thru the ice. When she had washed away all signs of  mourning, she painted and decked herself and went to the chief's tepee.  When his son saw her, he loved her, and a feast was made in honor of her  wedding.    When the widow's daughter found herself forsaken, she wept bitterly.  After a day or two she took her little brother in her arms and went to  the tepee of an old woman who lived at one end of the village. The old  woman's tumble down tepee was of bark and her dress and clothing was of  old smoke-dried tent cover. But she was kind to the two waifs and took  them in willingly.    The little girl was eager to find her mother. The old woman said to her:  \"I suspect your mother has painted her face red. Do not try to find her.  If the chief's son marries her she will not want to be burdened with  you.\"    The old woman was right. The girl went down to the river, and sure  enough found a hole cut in the ice and about it lay the filth that the  mother had washed from her body. The girl gathered up the filth and went  on. By and by she came to a second hole in the ice. Here too was filth,  but not so much as at the previous place. At the third hole the ice was  clean.    The girl knew now that her mother had painted her face red. She went at  once to the chief's tepee,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3410"],[0,"The American Spirit in Literature: A Chronicle of Great Interpreters (#5)"],[1,"fellow-townsmen of Providence which points the whole  moral of the terrible mistake made by the men who sought spiritual  liberty in America for themselves, only to deny that same liberty to  others. \"I have only one motion and petition,\" begs this veteran pioneer  who had forded many a swollen stream and built many a rude bridge in the  Plantations: \"it is this, that after you have got over the black brook  of some soul bondage yourselves, you tear not down the bridge after  you.\"    It is for such wise and humane counsels as this that Roger Williams  is remembered. His opponents had mightier intellects than his, but the  world has long since decided against them. Colonial sermon literature  is read today chiefly by antiquarians who have no sympathy for the  creed which once gave it vitality. Its theology, like the theology of  \"Paradise Lost or the Divine Comedy,\" has sunk to the bottom of the  black brook. But we cannot judge fairly the contemporary effect of this  pulpit literature without remembering the passionate faith that made  pulpit and pews copartners in a supreme spiritual struggle. Historians  properly insist upon the aesthetic poverty of the New England Puritans;  that their rule of life cut them off from an enjoyment of the dramatic  literature of their race, then just closing its most splendid epoch;  that they had little poetry or music and no architecture and plastic  art. But we must never forget that to men of their creed the Sunday  sermons and the week-day \"lectures\" served as oratory, poetry, and  drama. These outpourings of the mind and heart of their spiritual  leaders were the very stuff of human passion in its intensest forms.  Puritan churchgoers, passing hours upon hours every week in rapt  absorption with the noblest of all poetry and prose in the pages of  their chief book, the Bible, were at least as sensitive to the beauty  of words and the sweep of emotions as our contemporaries upon whose  book-shelves Spenser and Milton stand unread.    It is only by entering into the psychology of the period that we  can estimate its attitude towards the poetry written by the pioneers  themselves. The \"Bay Psalm Book\" (1640), the first book printed in the  colonies, is a wretched doggerel arrangement of the magnificent King  James Version of the Psalms, designed to be sung in churches. Few of  the New England churches could sing more than half-a-dozen tunes, and  a pitch-pipe was for a long time the only musical instrument allowed.  Judged as hymnology or poetry, the Bay \"Psalm Book\" provokes a smile.  But the men and women who used it as a handbook of devotion sang it with  their hearts aflame. In judging such a popular seventeenth-century poem  as Wigglesworth's \"Day of Doom\" one must strip oneself quite free from  the twentieth century, and pretend to be sitting in the chimney-corner  of a Puritan kitchen, reading aloud by that firelight which, as Lowell  once humorously suggested, may have added a \"livelier relish\" to the  poet's \"premonitions of eternal combustion.\" Lowell could afford to  laugh about it, having crossed that particular black brook. But for  several generations the boys and girls of New England had read the \"Day  of Doom\" as if Mr. Wigglesworth, the gentle and somewhat sickly minister  of Malden, had veritably peeped into Hell. It is the present fashion to  underestimate the power of Wigglesworth's verse. At its best it has a  trampling, clattering shock like a charge of cavalry and a sound  like clanging steel. Mr. Kipling and other cunning ballad-makers have  imitated the peculiar rhyme structure chosen by the nervous little  parson. But no living poet can move his readers to the fascinated horror  once felt by the Puritans as they followed Wigglesworth's relentless  gaze into the future of the soul's destiny.    Historical curiosity may still linger, of course, over other  verse-writers of the period. Anne Bradstreet's poems, for instance,  are not without grace and womanly sweetness, in spite of their didactic  themes and portentous length. But this lady, born in England, the  daughter of Governor Dudley and later the wife of Governor Bradstreet,  chose to imitate the more fantastic of the moralizing poets of England  and France. There is little in her hundreds of pages which seems today  the inevitable outcome of her own experience in the New World. For  readers who like roughly mischievous satire, of a type initiated in  England by Bishop Hall and Donne, there is \"The Simple Cobbler of  Agawam\" written by the roving clergyman Nathaniel Ward. But he lived  only a dozen years in Massachusetts, and his satirical pictures are  scarcely more \"American\" than the satire upon German professors in  \"Sartor Resartus\" is \"German.\" Like Charles Dickens's \"American Notes,\"  Ward's give the reaction of a born Englishman in the presence of the  sights and the talk and the personages of the transatlantic world.    Of all the colonial writings of the seventeenth century, those that have  lost least of their interest through the lapse of years are narratives  of struggles with the Indians. The image of the \"bloody savage\" has  always hovered in the background of the American imagination. Our boys  and girls have \"played Indian\" from the beginning, and the actual Indian  is still found, as for three hundred years past, upon the frontier  fringe of our civilization. Novelists like Cooper, historians like  Parkman, poets like Longfellow, have dealt with the rich material  offered by the life of the aborigines, but the long series begins with  the scribbled story of colonists. Here are comedy and tragedy, plain  narratives of trading and travel, missionary zeal and triumphs; then the  inevitable alienation of the two races and the doom of the native.    The \"noble savage\" note may be found in John Rolfe, the husband of  Pocahontas, with whom, poor fellow, his \"best thoughts are so intangled  and enthralled.\" Other Virginians, like Smith, Strachey, and Percy, show  close naturalistic observation, touched with the abounding Elizabethan  zest for novelties. To Alexander Whitaker, however, these \"naked slaves  of the devil\" were \"not so simple as some have supposed.\" He yearned  and labored over their souls, as did John Eliot and Roger Williams  and Daniel Gookin of New England. In the Pequot War of 1637 the  grim settlers resolved to be rid of that tribe once for all, and the  narratives of Captain Edward Johnson and Captain John Mason, who led in  the storming and slaughter at the Indians' Mystic Fort, are as piously  relentless as anything in the Old Testament. Cromwell at Drogheda, not  long after, had soldiers no more merciless than these exterminating  Puritans, who wished to plough their fields henceforth in peace. A  generation later the storm broke again in King Philip's War. Its  tales of massacre, captivity, and single-handed fighting linger in the  American imagination still. Typical pamphlets are Mary Rowlandson's  thrilling tale of the Lancaster massacre and her subsequent captivity,  and the loud-voiced Captain Church's unvarnished description of King  Philip's death. The King, shot down like a wearied bull-moose in the  deep swamp, \"fell upon his face in the mud and water, with his gun  under him.\" They \"drew him through the mud to the upland; and a doleful,  great, naked dirty beast he looked like.\" The head brought only thirty  shillings at Plymouth: \"scanty reward and poor encouragement,\" thought  Captain Church. William Hubbard, the minister of Ipswich, wrote a  comprehensive \"Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians in New  England,\" bringing the history down to 1677. Under the better known  title of \"Indian Wars,\" this fervid and dramatic tale, penned in a quiet  parsonage, has stirred the pulses of every succeeding generation. The  close of King Philip's War, 1676, coinciding as it does with Bacon's  Rebellion in Virginia, marks an era in the development of our  independent life. The events of that year, in the words of Professor  Tyler, \"established two very considerable facts, namely, that English  colonists in America could be so provoked as to make physical resistance  to the authority of England, and, second, that English colonists in  America could, in the last resort, put down any combination of Indians  that might be formed against them. In other words, it was then made  evident that English colonists would certainly be safe in the new world,  and also that they would not always be colonists.\"    While the end of an historical or literary era cannot always be thus  conveniently indicated by a date, there is no doubt that the final  quarter of the seventeenth century witnessed deep changes in the outward  life and the inner temper of the colonists. The \"first fine careless  rapture\" was over. Only a few aged men could recall the memory of the  first settlements. Between the founding of Jamestown and the rebellion  under the leadership of Nathaniel Bacon almost seventy years had  intervened, an interval corresponding to that which separates us from  the Mexican War. Roger Williams ended his much-enduring and beneficent  life in the flourishing town of Providence in 1684. He had already  outlived Cotton and Hooker, Shepard and Winthrop, by more than thirty  years. Inevitably men began, toward the end of the century, to take  stock of the great venture of colonization, to scrutinize their own  history and present position, to ask searching questions of themselves.  \"You have better food and raiment than was in former times,\" wrote  the aged Roger Clark, in 1676; \"but have you better hearts than your  forefathers had?\" Thomas Walley's \"Languishing Commonwealth\" maintains  that \"Faith is dead, and Love is cold, and Zeal is gone.\" Urian Oakes's  election sermon of 1670 in Cambridge is a condemnation of the prevalent  worldliness and ostentation. This period of critical inquiry and  assessment, however, also gives grounds for just pride. History,  biography,"]]]
