You--you are the culumniator, whose hand would have  stained mine if it touched it!\"    \"If it has not stained your hand,\" exclaimed the count, \"take this, old  dotard; it will stain for ever your visage.\"    And with a blow on the face of the venerable old man he drew blood--the  blood of Diego Lainez, of him who in former times was the terror of the  Moors, the bravest cavalier of Castile, the son of Lain Calvo!    \"Justice of God!\" cried the outraged old man, vainly endeavouring, such  was his weakness, to return the blow of the coward and avenge the insult  which he had received; anger, however, stopped his voice, clouded his  visage, and made his head so dazed that he fell to the floor.    \"Traitor! unworthy knight and bad subject!\" exclaimed the king. \"In my  presence you dared to raise your hand against an aged cavalier, who, old  as he is, is worth more than your entire race! As God lives, my  executioner shall cut off, to-morrow, in the public place of Leon, the  hand which has acted in so dastardly and cowardly a manner! My guard  here! My guard here!\"    The voice of Don Fernando, however, was lost in the noise and uproar  which arose throughout the saloon. The ladies uttered terrified cries  and fled precipitately into the inner apartments of the Alcazar,  believing that they would find in them a refuge from the tumult; and the  cavaliers, divided into two parties, one in favour of Don Gome and the  other for Diego Lainez, placed their hands on their swords and broke out  into loud imprecations and threats, without paying any attention to the  presence, to the words, or to the authority of the king or of the  princes. At last Don Fernando succeeded in allaying the tumult just at  the moment when the old man was rising from the ground. He then clasped  him in his arms and pressed his lips on his cheek, as if to remove from  it the stain which the blow of De Gormaz had imprinted thereon. His  anger being calmed for the time, he was able to reflect, and the prudent  monarch thought that, if he insisted on arresting De Gormaz then and  there, torrents of blood would flow in the Alcazar and that  inextinguishable feuds would blaze up amongst the flower of the chivalry  of Leon and Castile. He remembered that the grandee De Vivar had  numerous champions, on whom he could rely to avenge such an affront, and  he considered it more prudent to defer the punishment of the count to a  later time. The voice of Diego was then heard in support of such a  decision.    \"To Vivar, to my castle!\" exclaimed the old man, tearing his hair, and  shedding the first tears which came from his eyes since he had girded on  the sword and buckled on the spurs of a knight. The outrage inflicted on  him had not disturbed his mind so much that he could not remember what  was due to the dwelling-place of the king, in whose presence no  honourable cavalier could draw his sword to avenge personal insults.    Diego Lainez was obeyed: a few minutes later he was journeying, in a  litter, on the road that led to Vivar, accompanied by many followers,  both on foot and on horseback; and the halls of the Alcazar became  deserted.    The Count de Gormaz had many partisans in Leon, as was proved by the  large number of cavaliers who thronged to his side when the friends of  De Vivar grasped the hilts of their swords, enraged by the vile offence  inflicted on the old man. However, when the tumult had been appeased,  when reflection forced them to realise on whose side was right, Don Gome  could scarcely have found a cavalier to draw sword in his defence. It  might be said on the following day that, in a few hours, the count had  lost all his friends, for those who had been hitherto firmly attached to  him were now content to remain neutral with regard to the matter of  which everyone was speaking.          CHAPTER III    IN WHICH THE READER WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO RODRIGO AND HIS SQUIRE  BETWEEN LEON AND VIVAR      We have seen Rodrigo quitting the Alcazar precisely at the time when the  pleasures of the ball and the fact of finding himself amongst the most  beautiful women of Leon and Castile should have made his remaining there  exceedingly agreeable. And whither was he going? What was his object in  departing from the centre of joyousness and pleasure? The chronicles do  not give much information on this occasion, as on many others, as to the  actions of our hero.    The tumult and bustle of the Court were insupportable to him; his uneasy  soul required calm and solitude; he desired to concentrate his thoughts  on one subject alone, on the love which, the more it was thwarted, the  more it became strong and burning in his heart. What were all those  beautiful women to him, all those elegant and noble cavaliers, all that  delicious music, all those amusements and dances, all that animation,  that life, that gaiety of the Court, if he could not continue his sweet  converse and his love-whisperings with Ximena--his love-dreams of love  and happiness of a former time? He had reflected that if he had gone to  take leave of his father, he could not do so without also taking leave  of the king and of the cavaliers who surrounded him, and in that case  they would all have endeavoured to prevent his abandoning the pleasures  of the ball, as it would be impossible for them to understand his desire  and the necessity he felt to be alone. He therefore returned to the  house in which he had apartments, and mounting a spirited steed, he rode  out from Leon, followed by Fernan Carde[~n]a, a squire, who had formerly  been that of his father and now was his, for the prudent Diego had  transferred him to his son on the eve of the battle of Atapuerca, in  which Rodrigo fought for the first time. He knew that Fernan, on account  of his valour, his joyous and sprightly disposition, his experience, and  above all, his loyalty, was, amongst all his vassals, the most fitted to  accompany and serve the youth. Speaking strictly, the name of squire  could scarcely be given to Fernan, considering the functions he  performed with regard to Rodrigo, and the duties which were usually  fulfilled by those that bore that name. Fernan was in reality a  companion to Rodrigo; he might be considered as his military tutor  rather than as his squire; and judging by the arms, both offensive and  defensive, which he carried, he might almost have been mistaken for a  cavalier.    The night was calm and beautiful, and a brilliant moon illumined the  country lying around Leon, which was also enlivened by the shouts of the  peasants, still engaged in their dances, and by their songs and  acclamations. Some excited by the light of the bonfires, some by that of  the moon, and some indeed by the abundant draughts of the juice of the  grape, which they had indulged in, drinking to the health of Don  Fernando, who had shown himself so liberal to everyone on that memorable  day.    \"By Judas Iscariot!\" said Fernan to himself, \"it appears to me as if  they were a band of witches, celebrating their Sabbath around those  bonfires, having bewitched my lord and master. He, who was always in  good humour and fond of conversing with me on assaults and battles, and  of the Moorish dogs spitted on my lance, does not now seem to care a pin  where he goes or what he sees, and rides on as silent as the dead.  However, it is my opinion that it is that Ximena who has bewitched him,  she whom he intended to marry before the falling out of Don Gormaz--may  God confound him!--with De Vivar, whom I pray God may bless. Certainly  that maiden is a dainty bit, not alone for a hidalgo, but for an  emperor; notwithstanding, I don't see why my master should so put  himself about for any woman, be she noble or simple. There are many more  women than men, for, whilst we go to the wars and half of us are left  there, they, the minxes, remain peaceably in their homes, waiting till  God, who created them, takes their lives, and the numbers that there are  of them everywhere is becoming a regular plague. Then, if there are two  women for every man, is it not simple nonsense and foolery to make such  a fuss about losing one of them. Oh, how little would the son of my  mother be troubled if he were to lose the two that fall to his share,  for neither of them will let him enjoy her love, with their jealousies  and quarrellings. We shall arrive at Vivar to-morrow morning, if the  pace at which we are going does not kill our horses, and I swear by the  name I bear, that I will not let Mayorica, the maid of my lady Do[~n]a  Teresa, ill-treat and persecute me by her jealousies. For, if two women  fall to the lot of each man, why must one of them get enraged if he  should love the other? By the soul of Beelzebub, why should I get out of  temper on account of such unreasonable conduct on the part of women? But  the selfishness of my master gives me much pain, and I feel it on my  conscience to divert him a little, for the mind must be distracted if  this tedious journey is to be made any way bearable. These roads are  rougher than those of glory, and this continuous trot does not conduce  to bodily comfort.\"    Thus reflecting, Fernan applied his long rowelled spurs to his horse and  soon joined his master.    \"We have a fine night, sir,\" he said to him; but Rodrigo still continued  pensive, urged on his steed without intermission, and did not make any  reply.    \"We have not yet heard the cock crow at the inns we are leaving behind  us, and our journey is half over; it appears to me that we might  somewhat slacken our pace, for, without killing ourselves or our horses,  we can easily arrive at Vivar before midday.\"    Rodrigo did not seem to hear, and Fernan continued--    \"This night reminds me of one on which, being in the service of your  father, we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#5)"],[1,"passengers, and its lamps, which had  never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this  mournful re-invasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer's eyes, like  a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind,  besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the  companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that  terror of the law and the law's officers, which may at times assail  the most honest.    As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a  little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French  eating-house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny  salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many  women of different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a  morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon  that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly  surroundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll's favourite; of a  man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.    An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She  had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy; but her manners were  excellent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde's, but he was not at  home; he had been in that night very late,    33)    but had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing  strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often  absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen  him till yesterday.    \"Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,\" said the lawyer; and  when the woman began to declare it was impossible, \"I had better  tell you who this person is,\" he added. \"This is Inspector Newcomen  of Scotland Yard.\"    A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face. \"Ah!\" said  she, \"he is in trouble! What has he done?\"    Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. \"He don't seem a  very popular character,\" observed the latter. \"And now, my good  woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us.\"    In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman  remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms;  but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was  filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a  good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from  Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of  many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the  rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly  ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside  out;    34)    lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of  grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned. From these  embers the inspector disinterred the butt-end of a green  cheque-book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other  half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched  his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to  the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to  the murderer's credit, completed his gratification.    \"You may depend upon it, sir,\" he told Mr. Utterson: \"I have him in  my hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the  stick or, above all, burned the cheque-book. Why, money's life to  the man. We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get  out the handbills.\"    This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde  had numbered few familiars--even the master of the servant-maid  had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had  never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed  widely, as common observers will. Only on one point, were they  agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity  with which the fugitive impressed his beholders.    35)                             INCIDENT OF THE LETTER    IT was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to  Dr. Jekyll's door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and  carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had  once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known  as the laboratory or the dissecting-rooms. The doctor had bought  the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own  tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the  destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. It was the  first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his  friend's quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with  curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness  as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now  lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus,  the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and  the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further  end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize;    36)    and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the  doctor's cabinet. It was a large room, fitted round with glass  presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a  business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty  windows barred with iron. A fire burned in the grate; a lamp was  set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog  began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr.  Jekyll, looking deadly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor,  but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.    \"And now,\" said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \"you  have heard the news?\"    The doctor shuddered. \"They were crying it in the square,\" he said.  \"I heard them in my dining-room.\"    \"One word,\" said the lawyer. \"Carew was my client, but so are you,  and I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to  hide this fellow?\"    \"Utterson, I swear to God,\" cried the doctor, \"I swear to God I  will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am  done with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does  not want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is  quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\"      The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend's feverish  manner. \"You seem pretty    37)    sure of him,\" said he; \"and for your sake, I hope you may be right.  If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\"    \"I am quite sure of him,\" replied Jekyll; \"I have grounds for  certainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing  on which you may advise me. I have--I have received a letter; and  I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like  to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am  sure; I have so great a trust in you.\"    \"You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\" asked  the lawyer.    \"No,\" said the other. \"I cannot say that I care what becomes of  Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character,  which this hateful business has rather exposed.\"    Utterson ruminated a while; he was surprised at his friend's  selfishness, and yet relieved by it. \"Well,\" said he, at last, \"let  me see the letter.\"    The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \"Edward  Hyde\": and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer's  benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a  thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as  he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The  lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the  intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of  his past suspicions.    38)      \"Have you the envelope?\" he asked.    \"I burned it,\" replied Jekyll, \"before I thought what I was about.  But it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\"    \"Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?\" asked Utterson.    \"I wish you to judge for me entirely,\" was the reply. \"I have lost  confidence in myself.\"    \"Well, I shall consider,\" returned the lawyer. \"And now one word  more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that  disappearance?\"    The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness: he shut his  mouth tight and nodded.    \"I knew it,\" said Utterson. \"He meant to murder you. You have had a  fine escape.\"    \"I have had what is far more to the purpose,\" returned the doctor  solemnly: \"I have had a lesson--O God, Utterson, what a lesson I  have had!\" And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.    On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with  Poole. \"By the by,\" said he, \"there was a letter handed in to-day:  what was the messenger like?\" But Poole was positive nothing had  come except by post; \"and only circulars by that,\" he added.    This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the  letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had  been    39)    written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently  judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,  were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \"Special edition.  Shocking murder of an M. P.\" That was the funeral oration of one  friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest  the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the  scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make;  and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing  for advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought,  it might be fished for.    Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr.  Guest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a  nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular  old wine that had long dwelt"]]]
