No one would look after the  young; the bees would wander about looking for their mother, many of  them leaving the hive. The workers who were building the comb would  scatter, the gatherers of honey would no longer visit the flowers, the  guards at the gate would give up their post; and the enemies of the  hive, who are always watching for a chance to come in and steal, would  enter and leave without any one giving a thought to the defense of the  treasure which it had taken so long to collect. And poverty, little by  little, would creep into the city; and the miserable inhabitants would  before long all die of sorrow and hunger, though every flower of summer  should be blossoming before them.    But if the queen be put back before the bees have suffered too much,  before they believe her to be lost forever, they will give her the  deepest, most touching welcome. They will flock eagerly round her;  excited groups will crawl over each other in their anxiety to see her.  They rush to offer her honey, and lead her in triumph back to the royal  chamber. And order at once comes back and work starts again, from the  comb gatherer of brood-cells to the furthest cells where the reserve  honey is stored. And the bees go forth to the flowers, in long black  files, to return, in less than three minutes sometimes, with their  harvest of nectar and pollen. The streets will be swept, thieves and  other enemies driven out, and in the hive will be heard the soft sounds  of the strange hymn of rejoicing, which would seem to be the chant that  denotes the presence of the queen.    A number of instances could be given of the absolute devotion that the  workers show for their queen. Should a disaster fall on the city;  should the hive or the comb collapse; should the bees suffer from  hunger, from cold or disease, and die in their thousands, the queen will  nearly always be found, alive and safe, beneath the bodies of her  faithful daughters. They may be relied on to protect her, and help her  to escape; they will keep for her the last drop of honey, the last  morsel of food. And be the disaster never so great, they will not lose  heart so long as the queen be alive. You may break their comb twenty  times in succession, twenty times take from them their young and their  food, you will still never succeed in making them despair of the future.  Though they be starving, and so few in number that they scarcely can  conceal their mother from the enemy's gaze, they will set about to start  the city again and to provide for what is most pressing. They will  quietly accept the new conditions, and divide the work between them in  accordance with these conditions; they will take up their labors again  with extraordinary patience, and zeal, and intelligence.    \"I have come across a colony of bees,\" says Langstroth, \"that was not  sufficiently large to cover a comb of three inches square, and yet they  tried to rear a queen. For two whole weeks did these bees cherish their  hope. Finally, when their number was reduced by a half, their queen was  born, but her wings were imperfect, and she was unable to fly.  Incomplete as she was, her bees did not treat her with less respect.  Another week, and scarcely a dozen remained alive; a few days more, and  the queen had vanished, leaving only a few wretched, inconsolable  insects mourning for her on the comb.\"    I have more than once had queens sent to me from Italy, for the Italian  species is stronger, more active and gentler than our own. It is the  custom to forward them in small boxes, with holes made in the top so as  to let in the air. In these boxes, some food is placed, and the queen  put in, together with a certain number of workers, who are selected as  far as possible from among the oldest bees in the hive. (The age of the  bee can easily be told by its body, which becomes more polished, thinner  and almost bald as it grows older; and more particularly by the wings,  which the hard work uses and tears.) It is the mission of these  worker-bees to feed the queen during the journey, to tend her and guard  her. I would frequently find, when the box arrived, that nearly every  one of the workers had died. On one occasion, indeed, they had all  perished of hunger; but in this instance, as in all others, the queen  was alive, unharmed and full of strength. The last of her companions had  probably died in the act of presenting the last drop of honey she held  in her sac to the queen, who was the emblem of a life more precious and  more sacred than her own.      It is probably not because of the queen herself, but of the future that  she represents, that the bees show so great a devotion. For they are by  no means sentimental; and should one of their number return to the hive  so badly wounded that she will be unable to work again, they will  unmercifully drive her away from the city. But for their mother they  always show the same strong attachment. They will recognize her from  among all; and even though she be old, crippled and forlorn, the guards  at the gate will never allow another queen to enter the hive, however  young and much needed she be.    When the queen has grown old, the bees will bring up a certain number of  royal princesses to take her place. What happens then to the old queen?  As to this, we have no certain knowledge; but bee-keepers will  occasionally find a magnificent young queen perched on the central comb  of the hive, and in some dark corner, hidden away at the back, the  haggard old queen who had reigned before her. In cases like this the  bees will have to take the greatest care to protect her from the hatred  of the powerful newcomer who longs for her death; for queen hates queen  so fiercely that, were two to find themselves under the same roof, they  would immediately fly at each other. One would like to believe that the  bees contrive to provide a shelter for their poor old queen, in some  far-away corner of the hive, where she may end her days in peace. But  here we are confronted again by one of the thousand mysteries of the  city of wax; and we are once more shown that the habits and actions of  the bees depend on themselves, and are governed by an intelligence much  greater than we are inclined to believe.      What would the bees do, if we, by force or by some trick, were to bring  a second queen into the city? Though their sting is always in readiness,  and they make constant use of it in fights among themselves, _they will  never draw it against a queen;_ nor will the queen ever draw hers on  man, or an animal or any ordinary bee. She will never unsheath her royal  weapon--which is curved, instead of being straight, like that of the  worker-bee--except only when she is opposed to, and fighting, another  queen.    If a new queen were brought into the hive, the bees would at once  surround her, making a ring with their bodies. They would thus form a  sort of living prison in which the captive would be unable to move; and  in this prison they would keep her for twenty-four hours, or longer if  need be, till the victim shall have died of suffocation or hunger.    But if the reigning queen should approach, and seem anxious to attack  the stranger, the living walls would at once fly open; and the bees,  forming a circle around the two, will eagerly watch the strange duel, in  which they themselves will take no part whatever. For it is written that  against a queen-bee only another queen may draw her sting.    If the fight should last too long, or one of the rivals attempt to  escape, then, no matter whether she be the reigning queen or the  intruder, she will at once be seized and kept in the living prison until  she again shows readiness to attack her foe. The reigning queen will  almost always conquer, being emboldened and encouraged perhaps by the  knowledge that she is fighting in her own home, with her subjects around  her. Perhaps too the bees may make some difference in their treatment of  the rivals during the period of imprisonment, for their mother seems  scarcely to suffer from it at all, while the stranger always appears a  little weakened and bruised.      We have shown that, if the queen be taken away from the hive, her people  will mourn her, and display every sign of the deepest distress. If she  be put back, a few hours later, her daughters will hasten joyfully  towards her, offering honey; one section will respectfully form a lane  for her to pass through, while others, their heads bent low, will move  in great semi-circles before her, singing the song of welcome that is  only heard at moments of great happiness and solemn devotion.    But if a new queen were placed in the hive, instead of the old one, the  greatest trouble and disturbance would ensue. The bees would know at  once that a trick had been played on them; the impostor would be seized,  and immediately confined in the terrible living walls made by their  bodies, and held there until she died. She will hardly ever be allowed  to come out alive.    There are ways, however, of dealing with this hatred of the new-comer;  and one of them is to bring her into the hive enclosed in a little cage  with iron wires, which is hung between two combs. The door of the cage  is made of wax and honey; the bees, after their first display of fury,  will gnaw at the wax and honey, thus freeing the prisoner, who will then  sometimes be allowed to go unharmed, and be subsequently accepted. There  is another way, too, that is used by a bee-master at Rottingdean, who  imagined that the unfavorable reception of the new queen might in some  degree be caused by her own curious behavior. No sooner will she have  been put into the hive than she will rush wildly to and fro, vainly  trying to hide in one place or another, and generally doing all she can  to make the bees"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38658"],[0,"Self-Instructor in the Art of Hair Work, Dressing Hair, Making Curls, Switches, (#5)"],[1,"tration]    Braid this over a small wire, with a hole in one end like the eye of a  needle, so as to draw a small cord in the place of the wire.
