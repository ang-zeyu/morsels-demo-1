The angel in it is most  beautiful, and the whole picture would bear comparison with the works of  the best artists of this period, if the drawing were more correct.[18]    What I have already adduced sufficiently proves that the art was not  neglected in the Papal States, even in the ruder ages; and that men of  genius from time to time appeared there, who, without leaving their  native places, still gave an impulse to art. Florence, however, has ever  been the great capital of design, the leading academy, and the Athens of  Italy. It would be idle to question her indisputable claim to this high  honour; and Sixtus IV., who, as we have before mentioned, sought through  all Italy for artists to ornament the Sistine chapel, procured the  greatest number from Tuscany; nor were there to be found amongst them  any who were his own subjects, except Pietro Perugino, and he too had  risen to notice and celebrity in Florence. These then are the first  mature fruits of the Roman school, for until this period they had been  crude and tasteless. Pietro is her Masaccio, her Ghirlandajo, her all.  We will here take a short view of him and his scholars, reserving,  however, the divine Raffaello to the next epoch, which indeed is  designated by his illustrious name.    Pietro Vannucci della Pieve,[19] as he calls himself in some pictures,  or of Perugia in others, from the citizenship which he there enjoyed,  had studied under a master of no great celebrity, if we are to believe  Vasari; and this was a Pietro da Perugia, as Bottari conjectured, or  Niccolo Alunno, as it was reported in Foligno. Mariotti pretends that  Pietro advanced himself greatly in Perugia in the schools of Bonfigli,  and Pietro della Francesca, from which he not only derived that  excellence in perspective, which, from the testimony of Vasari was so  much admired in Florence, but also much of his design and colouring.[20]  Mariotti then raises a doubt whether, when he went as an artist to  Florence, he became the scholar of Verrocchio, as writers report, or  whether he did not rather perfect himself from the great examples of  Masaccio, and the excellent painters who at that time flourished there;  and he finally determines in favour of the opinion held by Pascoli,  Bottari, and Taja, and adopted by Padre Resta, in his _Galleria  Portatile_, p. 10, that Verrocchio was never his master. It is well  worth while to read the disquisitions of this able writer in his fifth  letter, where we may admire the dexterity with which he settles a point  so perplexed and so interesting to the history of art. I will only add  that it appears to me not improbable, that Pietro, when he arrived at  Florence, attached himself to this most celebrated artist, and was  instructed by him in design, and in the plastic art particularly, and in  that fine style of painting with which Verrocchio, without much  practising it himself, imbued both Vinci and Credi. Traditions are  seldom wholly groundless; they have generally some foundation in truth.    The manner of Pietro is somewhat hard and dry, like that of other  painters of his time; and he occasionally exhibits a poverty in the  drapery of his figures; his garments and mantles being curtailed and  confined. But he atones for these faults by the grace of his heads,  particularly in his boys and in his women; which have an air of elegance  and a charm of colour unknown to his contemporaries. It is delightful to  behold in his pictures, and in his frescos which remain in Perugia and  Rome, the bright azure ground which affords such high relief to his  figures; the green, purple, and violet tints so chastely harmonized, the  beautiful and well drawn landscape and edifices, which, as Vasari says,  was a thing until that time never seen in Florence. In his altarpieces  he is not sufficiently varied. There is a remarkable painting executed  for the church of S. Simone, at Perugia, of a Holy Family, one of the  first specimens of a well designed and well composed altarpiece. In  other respects Pietro did not make any great advances in invention; his  Crucifixions and his Descents from the Cross are numerous, and of an  uniform character. He has thus represented, with little variation, the  Ascensions of our Lord and of the Virgin, in Bologna, in Florence,  Perugia, and Citta di S. Sepolcro. He was reproached with this  circumstance in his lifetime, and defended himself by saying that no one  had a right to complain, as the designs were all his own. There is also  another defence, which is, that compositions, really beautiful, are  still seen with delight when repeated in different places; whoever sees  in the Sistine his S. Peter invested with the keys, will not be  displeased at finding at Perugia the same landscape, in a picture of the  Marriage of the Virgin. On the contrary, this picture is one of the  finest objects that noble city affords; and may be considered as  containing an epitome of the various styles of Pietro. In the opinion of  some persons, his frescos exhibit a more fertile invention, and greater  delicacy and harmony of colour. Of these, his masterpiece is in his  native city, in the Sala del Cambio. It is an evangelical subject, with  saints from the Old Testament, and with his own portrait, to which his  grateful fellow citizens attached an elegant eulogy. He is most eminent,  and adopts a sort of Raffaellesque style, in some of his latter  pictures. I have observed it in a Holy Family, in the Carmine in  Perugia. The same may be said too of certain small pictures, almost of a  miniature class; as in the grado of S. Peter, in Perugia, than which  nothing can be more finished and beautiful; and in many other pieces in  which he has spared no pains,[21] but which are few in comparison to the  multitude by his scholars, attributed to him.    In treating of the school of Pietro Perugino, it is necessary to advert  to what Taja,[22] and after him the author of the _Lettere Perugine_,  notices respecting his scholars, \"that they were most scrupulous in  adhering to the manner of their master, and as they were very numerous,  they have filled the world with pictures, which both by painters and  connoisseurs are very commonly considered as his.\" When his works in  Perugia are inspected, he generally rises in the esteem of travellers,  of whom many have only seen paintings incorrectly ascribed to him. In  Florence there are some of his pictures in the Grand Duke's collection:  and in the church of S. Chiara, his beautiful Descent from the Cross,  and some other works; but in private collections both here and in other  cities of Tuscany, many Holy Families are assigned to him, which are  most probably by Gerino da Pistoja, or some of his Tuscan scholars, of  whom there is a catalogue in our first book. The Papal states also  possessed many of his scholars, who were of higher reputation, nor so  wholly attached to his manner as the strangers. Bernardino Pinturicchio,  his scholar and assistant in Perugia and in Rome, was a painter little  valued by Vasari, who has not allowed him his full share of merit. He  has not the style of design of his master, and retains more than  consistent with his age, the ornaments of gold in his drapery; but he is  magnificent in his edifices, spirited in his countenances, and extremely  natural in every thing he introduces into his composition. As he was on  the most familiar footing with Raffaello, with whom he painted at Siena,  he has emulated his grace in some of his figures, as in his picture of  S. Lorenzo in the church of the Francescani di Spello, in which there is  a small S. John the Baptist, thought by some to be by Raphael himself.  He was very successful in arabesques and perspective; in which way he  was the first to represent cities in the ornaments of his fresco  paintings, as in an apartment of the Vatican, where in his landscapes he  introduced views of the principal cities of Italy. In many of his  paintings he retained the ancient custom of making part of his  decorations of stucco, as the arches, a custom which was observed in the  Milanese school to the time of Gaudenzio. Rome possesses some of his  works, particularly in the Vatican, and in Araceli. There is a good  picture by him in the duomo of Spello.[23] His best is at Siena, in the  magnificent sacristy of which we have already made mention. They consist  of ten historical subjects, containing the most memorable passages in  the life of Pius II., and on the outside is an eleventh, which  represents the Coronation of Pius III., by whom this work was ordered.    Vasari has added to the life of Pinturicchio that of Girolamo Genga, of  Urbino, at first a scholar of Signorelli, afterwards of Perugino, and  who remained some time pursuing his studies in Florence. He was, for a  long period, in the service of the Duke of Urbino, and attached himself  more to architecture than to painting, though, in the latter, he was  sufficiently distinguished to deserve a place in the history of art. We  cannot form a correct judgment of him, as a great part of his own works  have perished; and as he assisted Signorelli in Orvieto and other  places; and was assisted by Timoteo della Vite in Urbino, and in the  imperial palace of Pesaro by Raffaelle del Colle, and various others. In  the Petrucci palace at Siena, which now belongs to the noble family of  Savini, some historical pieces are ascribed to him near those of  Signorelli. They are described in the Lettere Senesi, and in the notes  published at Siena to the fourth volume of Vasari. These pieces are  praised as superior to those of Signorelli, and as in many parts  approaching the early style of Raffaello. Nor do I see how, in the above  mentioned letters, they could be supposed to be by Razzi, or Peruzzi, or  Pacchiarotto, \"_in their hard dry manner_\" when history assures us that  Girolamo was with Pandolfo a considerable time, which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],[0,"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#5)"],[1,"        ||      markings        |                      |----------------------------||----------------------|                      |   X  |  )(  |  ][  | Other ||  /\\  |  / \\  | Other |  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Oaxaca:             |  23  |   4  |   0  |   0   ||   7  |   6  |   14   |    Donaji-Sarabia    |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Tabasco:            |  53  |   2  |   0  |   0   ||  19  |  11  |   23   |    Teapa-Villahermosa|      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Guatemala:          |  45  |   6  |   0  |   0   ||  16  |  14  |   21   |    La Libertad       |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Guatemala:          |  32  |   0  |   0  |   0   ||  26  |   2  |    4   |    Finca Chama       |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Guatemala:          |  23  |   0  |   4  |   4   ||   6  |   4  |   21   |    Puerto Barrios    |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Honduras:           |   3  |   2  |   3  |   5   ||   2  |   1  |   10   |    Lago Yojoa        |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Nicaragua:          |  11  |  35  |   8  |   2   ||   0  |  19  |   37   |    La Cumplida       |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Nicaragua:          |   0  |   5  |   3  |   2   ||   0  |   3  |    7   |    Tipitapa          |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Nicaragua:          |   3  |   0  |   7  |   0   ||   0  |   5  |    5   |    Santo Thomas      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Costa Rica:         |   0  |   0  |  12  |   0   ||   0  |   0  |   12   |    Tenorio-Tilaran   |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Costa Rica:         |   0  |  11  |  19  |   8   ||   0  |   0  |   38   |    Las Canas-Liberia |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |                      |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  Costa Rica:         |   0  |   0  |  14  |  18   ||   0  |   0  |   32   |    Esparta           |      |      |      |       ||      |      |        |  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    [Footnote A: Longitudinal stripes present in two specimens.]        When this frog is active at night its dorsum is pale yellow; faint  flecks are present in some individuals. The white dorsolateral line  usually is evident in the tympanic region, but in many individuals a  dorsal pattern of lines and other marks is not evident. By day the  dorsum changes to yellowish tan or pale brown with dark brown or  reddish brown markings (Pl. 13). The venter is white, and the vocal  sac in breeding males is yellow. The iris is pale bronze with a brown  tint anterior and posterior to the pupil.    _Remarks._--_Hyla microcephala underwoodi_ has had a confused  nomenclatural history. The taxon was first named _Hyla microcephala_  by Boulenger (1898); this name was preoccupied by _Hyla microcephala_  Cope (1886). Cole and Barbour (1906) and Kellogg (1932) used the name  _Hyla phlebodes_ Stejneger (1906) for specimens of this frog from  Mexico. Dunn (1931, 1933, 1934) applied the name _Hyla underwoodi_ to  Panamanian specimens that we identify as _Hyla phlebodes_. Smith  (1951) named _Hyla microcephala martini_ from southern Mexico and  Guatemala and considered the northern populations to represent a  subspecies distinct from the Costa Rican _Hyla microcephala  underwoodi_, despite the fact the Stuart (1935:39) stated that  comparisons of specimens from El Peten, Guatemala, with the holotype  of _Hyla underwoodi_ showed only trivial differences.    Much of the confusion regarding the name _Hyla underwoodi_ stems from  the illustration given by Boulenger (1898:pl. 39, fig. 3) and  reproduced by Taylor (1952:892), which shows a frog having a unicolor  dorsum, dorsolateral white lines, and dark flanks. This pattern is in  marked contrast to the pattern seen in most preserved specimens, which  have the dorsum variously marked by dark brown lines or irregular  marks. Smith (1951:185), in his description of _Hyla microcephala  martini_ from southern Mexico, considered _H. underwoodi_ to be a  subspecies of _H. microcephala_ that lacked dorsal dark markings.    Data accumulated in 1961 through field studies by the senior author at  the type locality, Bebedero, and other localities in Guanacaste and  Puntarenas provinces in Costa Rica provide a reasonable explanation of  the differences in color pattern. As noted in the preceding description  of this subspecies, at night the dorsal markings are not evident in  many living individuals, whereas by day the dorsal markings are  prominent. Most collectors prepare their specimens by day; consequently  the majority of specimens have a pronounced dorsal pattern. Of the  frogs collected in Costa Rica in 1961, some specimens were preserved  at night; others from the same series were preserved by day. The  differences are striking. In those preserved at night, dorsal markings  are faint, if present at all. Some specimens closely match the figure  given by Boulenger (1898).    It is extremely doubtful if the frog described and illustrated by  Boulenger could be associated with either _Hyla phlebodes_ or _H.  microcephala microcephala_. Individuals of the former species lack  a dorsolateral white line and always have some dorsal markings  evident at night; furthermore, _H. phlebodes_ is not known to occur  on the Pacific lowlands. _Hyla microcephala microcephala_ occurs  farther southeast. Since there is no reason to doubt the type locality  of _H. underwoodi_, since specimens from the area around the type  locality that have been preserved at night are like the holotype in  pattern, and since the characteristics of the populations of the frogs  in Guanacaste are the same as, or gradually blend into those of,  populations in northern Central America and southern Mexico, the  frogs from throughout the entire range can be referred to one taxon,  the earliest name for which is _Hyla underwoodi_ Boulenger, which  herein is considered to be a subspecies of _H. microcephala_ Cope.    _Distribution._--_Hyla microcephala underwoodi_ inhabits the  Atlantic slopes and lowlands from southern Veracruz and extreme  northern Oaxaca eastward across the base of the Yucatan Peninsula  (possibly the species is extant in the northern part of the  peninsula) to British Honduras and thence southeastward through  the Caribbean lowlands and interior valleys in Honduras to central  Nicaragua, where it apparently avoids the forested Caribbean  lowlands and the dry Pacific lowlands of northwestern Nicaragua,  but in the vicinity of Managua invades the Pacific lowlands and  continues southward into northwestern Costa Rica as far as the  Puntarenas Peninsula (Fig. 1). In Mexico and Guatemala the species  has not been taken at elevations of more than 350 meters, whereas  farther south it occurs at higher elevations--780 meters at  Silencio, Costa Rica, 830 meters on Montana de Guaimaca, Honduras,  960 meters at Finca Tepeyac, Nicaragua, and 1200 meters at Finca  Venecia, Nicaragua.    _Specimens examined._--1270, as follows: +Mexico+: Campeche: Balchacaj,  FMNH 100406, UIMNH 20944-6; Encarnacion, FMNH 27069-70, 75784,  MCZ 28360, 29637, UIMNH 20948-58, 20965, USNM 134264-5; Escarcega,  UMMZ 122999; *7.5 km.
