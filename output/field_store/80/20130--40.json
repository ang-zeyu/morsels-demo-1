They shaved their  heads and cut themselves on their faces with knives, so that their  blood, instead of their tears, flowed for the loss of their great  leader. They enclosed his body in three coffins--one of gold, one  of silver, and one of iron--and they buried him at night, in a  secret spot in the mountains. When the funeral was over, they killed  the slaves who had dug the grave, as the Visigoths had done after  the burial of Alaric.    After the death of Attila we hear little more of the Huns.          GENSERIC THE VANDAL    KING FROM 427-477 A.D.    I    The Vandals were another wild and fierce tribe that came from the  shores of the Baltic and invaded central and southern Europe in  the later times of the Roman Empire.    In the fifth century some of these people occupied a region in  the south of Spain. One of their most celebrated kings was name  Gen'ser-ic. He became king in 427, when he was but twenty-one years  of age. He was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very  ordinary person.    Like most of the Vandals, he was a cruel and cunning man, but he  had great ability in many ways. He fought in battles even when  a boy and was known far and wide for his bravery and skill as a  leader.    About the time that Genseric became king, the governor of the Roman  province in the north of Africa, on the Mediterranean coast, was  a man called Count Boniface. This Count Boniface had been a good  and loyal officer of Rome; but a plot was formed against him by  Aetius, the general who had fought Attila at Chalons. The Roman  emperor at the time of the plot was Valentinian III. He was then  too young to act as ruler, so the affairs of government were managed  by his mother Placid'i-a.    [Illustration: PLACIDIA AND HER SON VALENTINIAN]    Aetius advised Placidia to dismiss Boniface and call him home from  Africa. He said the count was a traitor, and that he was going  to make war against Rome. At the same time he wrote secretly to  Count Boniface and told him that if he came to Rome the empress  would put him to death.    Boniface believed this story, and he refused to return to Rome.  He also sent a letter to Genseric, inviting him to come to Africa  with an army.    Genseric was greatly delighted to receive the invitation from Boniface.  He had long wanted to attack Rome and take from her some of the rich  countries she had conquered, and now a good opportunity offered.  So he got ready a great army of his brave Vandals, and they sailed  across the Strait of Gibraltar to Africa.    They soon gained possession of that part of the African coast on  which they had landed, and marched into other parts of the coast  and captured towns and cities. By this time Boniface had learned  all about the wicked plot of Aetius. He now regretted having invited  the Vandals to Africa and tried to induce them to return to Spain,  but Genseric sternly refused.    \"Never,\" he said, \"shall I go back to Spain until I am master of  Africa.\"    \"Then,\" cried Boniface, \"I will drive you back.\"    Soon afterwards there was a battle between the Romans and Vandals,  and the Romans were defeated. They were also defeated in several  other battles. At last they had to flee for safety to two or three  towns which the Vandals had not yet taken. One of these towns was  Hippo.    Genseric captured this town after a siege of thirteen months. Then  he burned the churches and other buildings, and laid waste the  neighboring country. This was what the Vandals did whenever they  took a town, and so the word _vandal_ came to mean a person who  needlessly or wantonly destroys valuable property.    A great many of the natives of Africa joined the army of Genseric.  They had for a long time been ill-treated by the Romans and were  glad to see them defeated. Genseric continued his work of conquest  until he took the city of Carthage, which he made the capital of  his new kingdom in Africa.    But he was not content with conquering merely on land. He built  great fleets and sailed over the Mediterranean, capturing trading  vessels. For many years he plundered towns along the coasts, so  that the name of Genseric became a terror to the people of all  the countries bordering the Mediterranean.    II    One day a Roman ship came to Carthage with a messenger from the  Empress Eudoxia to Genseric. Eudoxia was the widow of Valentinian  III. After ruling several years, Valentinian had just been murdered  by a Roman noble named Maximus, who had at once made himself emperor.    When the messenger entered the room where Genseric was, he said:    \"Great king, I bring you a message from the Empress Eudoxia. She  begs your help. She and her two beautiful daughters are in danger  in Rome. She wishes you to protect them against Maximus. She invites  you to come with an army to Rome and take the city. She and her  friends will help you as much as they can.\"    With a cry of joy Genseric sprang to his feet and exclaimed:    \"Tell the empress that I accept her invitation. I shall set out  for Rome immediately. I shall set out for Rome immediately. I shall  protect Eudoxia and her friends.\"    Genseric then got ready a fleet and a great army, and sailed across  the Mediterranean to the mouth of the Tiber. When the Emperor Maximus  heard that the Vandals were coming he prepared to flee from the  city, and he advised the Senate to do the same. The people were  so angry at this that they put him to death and threw his body  into the river.    Three days later Genseric and his army were at the gates of Rome.  There was no one to oppose them, and they marched in and took possession  of the city. It was only forty-five years since Alaric had been there  and carried off all the valuable things he could find. But since  then Rome had become again grand and wealthy, so there was plenty  for Genseric and his Vandals to carry away. They spent fourteen days  in the work of plunder. They sacked the temples and public buildings  and private houses and the emperor's palace, and they took off to  their ships immense quantities of gold and silver and jewels and  furniture, and destroyed hundreds of beautiful and priceless works  of art.    [Illustration: THE VANDALS IN ROME]    The Vandal king also put to death a number of Roman citizens and  carried away many more as slaves. He took Eudoxia and her daughters  with him to Carthage. One of the daughters was soon afterwards  married to Genseric's eldest son, Hunneric.    III    Some years after the capture of Rome by Genseric, there was a Roman  emperor named Ma-jo'ri-an. He was a good ruler and a brave man.  The Vandals still continued to attack and plunder cities in Italy  and other countries belonging to Rome, and Majorian resolved to  punish them. So he got together a great army and built a fleet  of three hundred ships to carry his troops to Carthage.    But he first marched his men across the Alps, through Gaul, and  down to the seaport of Carthagena in Spain, where his fleet was  stationed. He took this route because he expected to add to his  forces as he went along. Before sailing with his army for Carthage  he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people  the Vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was  generally believed.    So he dyed his hair and disguised himself in other ways and went  to Carthage, pretending that he was a messenger or ambassador from  the Roman emperor, coming to talk about peace. Genseric received  him with respect and entertained him hospitably, not knowing that  he was the Emperor Majorian. Of course peace was not made. The  emperor left Carthage after having got as much information as he  could.    But Genseric did not wait for the Roman fleet to come to attack  him in his capital. When he got word that it was in the Bay of  Carthagena, he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single  day burned or sank nearly all the Roman ships.    After this the Vandals became more than ever the terror of the  Mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it. Every year  their ships went round the coasts from Asia Minor to Spain, attacking  and plundering cities on their way and carrying off prisoners.    All the efforts of the Romans failed to put a stop to these ravages.  The Emperor Leo, who ruled over the eastern division of the Empire,  fitted out a great fleet at Constantinople to make another attempt  to suppress the pirates. There were more than a thousand ships in  this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men. The command  of the expedition was given to Bas-il'i-cus, the brother of Emperor  Leo's wife.    Basilicus sailed with his ships to Africa and landed the army not  far from Carthage. Genseric asked for a truce for five days to  consider terms of peace, and the truce was granted. But the cunning  Vandal was not thinking of peace. He only wanted time to carry  out a plan he had made to destroy the Roman fleet.    One dark night, during the truce, he filled the largest of his  ships with some of the bravest of his soldiers, and they sailed  silently and cautiously in among the Roman ships, towing behind  them large boats filled with material that would easily burn.    These boats were set on fire and floated against the Roman vessels,  which also were soon on fire. The flames quickly spread, and in  a very short time a great part of the Roman fleet was destroyed.  Basilicus fled with as many ships as he could save, and returned  to Constantinople.    This was the last attempt of the Romans to conquer the Vandals.  Genseric lived to a good old age, and when he died, in 477, all  the countries he had conquered during his life still remained parts  of the Vandal dominions.          THEODORIC THE OSTROGOTH    KING FROM 475-526 A.D.    I    The Ostrogoths, or East Goths, who had settled in Southern Russia,  at length pushed southward and westward to the mouth of the Danube.

Others, the bias of whose minds was in the opposite direction,  maintained, that to drink freely, frequent places of public resort, and take  their pleasure with song and revel, sparing to satisfy no appetite, and to  laugh and mock at no event, was the sovereign remedy for so great an evil:  and that which they affirmed they also put in practice, so far as they were  able, resorting day and night, now to this tavern, now to that, drinking  with an entire disregard of rule or measure, and by preference making the  houses of others, as it were, their inns, if they but saw in them aught that  was particularly to their taste or liking; which they were readily able to  do, because the owners, seeing death imminent, had become as reckless of  their property as of their lives; so that most of the houses were open to  all comers, and no distinction was observed between the stranger who  presented himself and the rightful lord. Thus, adhering ever to their  inhuman determination to shun the sick, as far as possible, they ordered  their life. In this extremity of our city's suffering and tribulation the  venerable authority of laws, human and divine, was abased and all but  totally dissolved, for lack of those who should have administered and  enforced them, most of whom, like the rest of the citizens, were either dead  or sick, or so hard bested for servants that they were unable to execute any  office; whereby every man was free to do what was right in his own eyes.    Not a few there were who belonged to neither of the two said parties, but  kept a middle course between them, neither laying the same restraint upon  their diet as the former, nor allowing themselves the same license in  drinking and other dissipations as the latter, but living with a degree of  freedom sufficient to satisfy their appetites, and not as recluses. They  therefore walked abroad, carrying in their hands flowers or fragrant herbs  or divers sorts of spices, which they frequently raised to their noses,  deeming it an excellent thing thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes,  because the air seemed to be everywhere laden and reeking with the stench  emitted by the dead and the dying and the odours of drugs.    Some again, the most sound, perhaps, in judgment, as they we also the most  harsh in temper, of all, affirmed that there was no medicine for the disease  superior or equal in efficacy to flight; following which prescription a  multitude of men and women, negligent of all but themselves, deserted their  city, their houses, their estate, their kinsfolk, their goods, and went into  voluntary exile, or migrated to the country parts, as if God in visiting men  with this pestilence in requital of their iniquities would not pursue them  with His wrath, wherever they might be, but intended the destruction of such  alone as remained within the circuit of the walls of the city; or deeming,  perchance, that it was now time for all to flee from it, and that its last  hour was come.    Of the adherents of these divers opinions not all died, neither did all  escape; but rather there were, of each sort and in every place, many that  sickened, and by those who retained their health were treated after the  example which they themselves, while whole, had set, being everywhere left  to languish in almost total neglect. Tedious were it to recount, how citizen  avoided citizen, how among neighbours was scarce found any that shewed  fellow-feeling for another, how kinsfolk held aloof, and never met, or but  rarely; enough that this sore affliction entered so deep into the minds of  men and women, that in the horror thereof brother was forsaken by brother,  nephew by uncle, brother by sister, and oftentimes husband by wife; nay,  what is more, and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to  abandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate, as if they  had been strangers. Wherefore the sick of both sexes, whose number could not  be estimated, were left without resource but in the charity of friends (and  few such there were), or the interest of servants, who were hardly to be had  at high rates and on unseemly terms, and being, moreover, one and all men  and women of gross understanding, and for the most part unused to such  offices, concerned themselves no farther than to supply the immediate and  expressed wants of the sick, and to watch them die; in which service they  themselves not seldom perished with their gains. In consequence of which  dearth of servants and dereliction of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk and  friends, it came to pass--a thing, perhaps, never before heard of that no  woman, however dainty, fair or well-born she might be, shrank, when stricken  with the disease, from the ministrations of a man, no matter whether he were  young or no, or scrupled to expose to him every part of her body, with no  more shame than if he had been a woman, submitting of necessity to that  which her malady required; wherefrom, perchance, there resulted in after  time some loss of modesty in such as recovered. Besides which many  succumbed, who with proper attendance, would, perhaps, have escaped death;  so that, what with the virulence of the plague and the lack of due tendance  of the sick, the multitude of the deaths, that daily and nightly took place  in the city, was such that those who heard the tale--not to say witnessed  the fact--were struck dumb with amazement. Whereby, practices contrary to  the former habits of the citizens could hardly fail to grow up among the  survivors.    It had been, as to-day it still is, the custom for the women that were  neighbours and of kin to the deceased to gather in his house with the women  that were most closely connected with him, to wail with them in common,  while on the other hand his male kinsfolk and neighbours, with not a few of  the other citizens, and a due proportion of the clergy according to his  quality, assembled without, in front of the house, to receive the corpse;  and so the dead man was borne on the shoulders of his peers, with funeral  pomp of taper and dirge, to the church selected by him before his death.  Which rites, as the pestilence waxed in fury, were either in whole or in  great part disused, and gave way to others of a novel order. For not only  did no crowd of women surround the bed of the dying, but many passed from  this life unregarded, and few indeed were they to whom were accorded the  lamentations and bitter tears of sorrowing relations; nay, for the most  part, their place was taken by the laugh, the jest, the festal gathering;  observances which the women, domestic piety in large measure set aside, had  adopted with very great advantage to their health. Few also there were whose  bodies were attended to the church by more than ten or twelve of their  neighbours, and those not the honourable and respected citizens; but a sort  of corpse-carriers drawn from the baser ranks who called themselves becchini  (1) and performed such offices for hire, would shoulder the bier, and with  hurried steps carry it, not to the church of the dead man's choice, but to  that which was nearest at hand, with four or six priests in front and a  candle or two, or, perhaps, none; nor did the priests distress themselves  with too long and solemn an office, but with the aid of the becchini hastily  consigned the corpse to the first tomb which they found untenanted. The  condition of lower, and, perhaps, in great measure of the middle ranks, of  the people shewed even worse and more deplorable; for, deluded by hope or  constrained by poverty, they stayed in their quarters, in their houses,  where they sickened by thousands a day, and, being without service or help  of any kind, were, so to speak, irredeemably devoted to the death which  overtook them. Many died daily or nightly in the public streets; of many  others, who died at home, the departure was hardly observed by their  neighbours, until the stench of their putrefying bodies carried the tidings;  and what with their corpses and the corpses of others who died on every hand  the whole place was a sepulchre.    It was the common practice of most of the neighbours, moved no less by fear  of contamination by the putrefying bodies than by charity towards the  deceased, to drag the corpses out of the houses with their own hands, aided,  perhaps, by a porter, if a porter was to be had, and to lay them in front of  the doors, where any one who made the round might have seen, especially in  the morning, more of them than he could count; afterwards they would have  biers brought up, or, in default, planks, whereon they laid them. Nor was it  once or twice only that one and the same bier carried two or three corpses  at once; but quite a considerable number of such cases occurred, one bier  sufficing for husband and wife, two or three brothers, father and son, and  so forth. And times without number it happened, that, as two priests,  bearing the cross, were on their way to perform the last office for some  one, three or four biers were brought up by the porters in rear of them, so  that, whereas the priests supposed that they had but one corpse to bury,  they discovered that there were six or eight, or sometimes more. Nor, for  all their number, were their obsequies honoured by either tears or lights or  crowds of mourners; rather, it was come to this, that a dead man was then of  no more account than a dead goat would be to-day. From all which it is  abundantly manifest, that that lesson of patient resignation, which the  sages were never able to learn from the slight and"]]]
