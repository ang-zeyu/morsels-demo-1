The  distance was considerable, and while the big bull was still a long way off  he was interrupted and turned from his course by another party of  hunters. The little one on the bog ceased to answer, but the large one that  had started last was, when the sun went down, already quite near, and  coming steadily along. When the moose was about breaking cover the guide  climbed partly up the big rock and noted the direction from which he was  coming, satisfying himself the game would appear on the side of the boulder  on which they were stationed. Another call, and the bull's hoofs were heard  beating the firm ground as he trotted up the slope toward the men. In full  view of the hunters, and about ten yards from them, grew a bunch of sapling  birches. There the moose paused and began a furious onslaught with his  antlers. Having tired of that, he turned toward the hunters, and going  down on his knees plowed his horns along the ground some distance, tossing  them, well loaded with vines, moss, and earth. With a snort, he shook these  from his head, the dirt falling on and around the two men lying behind the  rock. The city man about that time was enjoying his first acute attack of  moose fever. His teeth fairly chattered, and the guide had to grip his  rifle barrel to prevent it from rattling against the rock. Again the moose  came on and stood with his broadside toward them, not more than twelve feet  from the muzzle of the rifle. That was about as close quarters as the guide  cared for on his own account, so he gave the word to fire. The moose went  down with the shot, but immediately rose to his feet again. Again the  rifle spoke, and down he went, only to rise again. The third shot, however,  dropped him for the last time. Any of them would have proved fatal, but the  moose was too close for the men to take any chances.    The sportsman was convinced a moose would come at a man's call, and was so  excited over the fact that he slept none on that night.    I recall an experience of mine with an old bull on Pockwockamus Dead Water  (from my note book), Oct. 21, 1899.    I had gone only a few steps when I heard the splashing of a moose around  the bend of the stream ahead. There was a stretch of sand that led to an  island for which I made. There I concealed myself in the brush. I could  hear the big fellow wading along and ploughing through the reeds. I first  saw his antlers above the brush, and then his majestic head appeared. That  was all he would show, as he suspected a hidden foe and was on the lookout  for any apparent danger. For distance, he was about one hundred yards from  me and close inshore. Finally an opportunity presented itself, and I raised  my rifle and let go through the leaves where his neck should be. At the  report he made a quick turn and disappeared in the thick growth. I dashed  through the water, which was only about three feet deep, up the opposite  bank, and pushed my way through the bushes to where I had last seen him.  There he lay. My shot was fatal. As I appeared he snorted at me and tried  to regain his feet, but his efforts were ineffectual. I then put him out of  his misery with a shot through the heart.    [Illustration: COW MOOSE IN UMSASKIS LAKE.    Photographed from Life.]    Still another is worthy of mention.    At one time the guide and myself were coming back to camp, just about dusk,  after a long tramp, and were within sight of the tents, when we heard a  moose off to the right and close to the trail. The guide tried to coax him  out of the thicket by gently sounding the birch horn, which he had with  him. The moose turned with a crash and ran towards us, grunting all the  time. We were crouched behind a pile of birch brush. The big fellow kept  coming, until it seemed as if he might at any moment jump over the brush  pile and appear before us. It was too dark to shoot, so I slightly changed  my position, thinking I might see the moose outlined against the sky. Just  as I moved, the moose turned, ran some distance back into the woods and  stopped, grunting again as if he was not certain about it all; but he was  soon off, this time silently.    The next morning I was out early examining the tracks, and found it only  sixteen paces from where we were behind the brush pile to where his  lordship had been standing. I could see where he had barked the trees with  his antlers when he was first frightened.    It is fortunate for some of the sportsmen who journey to the north woods  after big game in the fall that their guides live so far away, otherwise  their reputation might suffer. This concerns both their personal traits and  their ability as hunters. Camp life brings out a man's true qualities. The  experience of a sportsman during his first attempt to lure a moose from his  home in the forest is related as follows:--    One of the party tried his luck at calling. He left the guide at the camp.  Quietly hiding among some shrubs, he gave a gentle but long-drawn-out call  and waited results. Hardly had the notes died away than there was a  tremendous crash, the alders parted, and the head of a large bull moose  appeared in the leafy frame within ten feet of the hunter. This abrupt  entrance dumfounded the sportsman whose confusion and consternation were  pretty evenly balanced at a moment when he needed his wits. Who was the  more frightened it was hard to tell. At any rate the caller returned to  camp posthaste minus his gun, horn, and hat, and with an expression that  was indeed pitiable.    A guide, who had a well-known preacher in the woods for a short time one  season, refused to take him the following year. On being asked the reason  he said:--    \"That man cares only for himself and thinks his guide can be wound up with  a key to work like a machine. He may be good enough to preach the Gospel,  but he ain't good enough for me to guide.\"    [Illustration: YOUNG BULL AND COW MOOSE SWIMMING.    (Lobster Lake.)    Photographed from Life.]    Many are the stories told by the guides about the unsuccessful sportsmen  who lack the moral courage to go home empty-handed. So accustomed have the  guides become to this sort of thing that they take it for granted, unless  instructed to the contrary, that they are to kill the game their employer  is to take home with him, provided he does not meet with success in the  early part of the hunt.    Another guide has to say of visiting sportsmen: \"Some of them shoot all  right, of course, but others are regular Spaniards. I had a fellow up this  way last fall that thought he was death on anything walking on four legs,  and that his gun was the best shooting tool ever turned out of a gun  factory. I paddled him right up to a bull moose standing in the water one  day, and he fired every shot in his magazine at it without rumpling a hair.    \"He didn't know enough to stop pumping the lever when all his shells were  gone, and just about then I chipped in with my rifle and put a ball through  the moose's shoulder that dropped him handy to the bank. The sportsman was  in the act of pulling the trigger of his empty gun, when he saw the moose  fall, and he didn't for a moment doubt but what he had killed him. He felt  so good that he rose right up in the canoe and yelled, and the next thing I  knew the canoe kind of slid out from under us and over we went into four  feet of mud and water.\"    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE IN CARIBOU LAKE.    Photographed from Life.]    A New York sportsman had his guide call a moose into the East Branch  thoroughfare one evening just before dark, and the guide tells of his  difficulty in pointing him out to the sportsman, who happened to be  nearsighted. The moose walked right out into the water away from the  concealment of the bushes and stopped. The guide nudged the sportsman and  whispered to shoot.    \"Shoot what?\" said the sportsman in a louder tone than was prudent under  the circumstances. \"I don't see anything to shoot.\"    \"Shoot the moose,\" he whispered again, \"there he stands under that  broken-topped spruce.\"    The lawyer craned his neck and peered into every shadow but the right one.  Two or three rods below the moose was a clump of bushes growing out beyond  the general shore line. The lawyer finally singled this out as the moose  and opened fire. He was perfectly cool, and every one of his shots went  straight to the centre of the object at which he was firing.    Moose are notoriously slow to start when alarmed, provided they have not  scented the hunter, and the one in question stood motionless until the  sportsman had fired five shots at his inanimate target and had but one  cartridge left in the magazine. Then the moose turned to escape, and, as  luck would have it, dashed directly into the line of fire. The lawyer saw  it, and with his sixth and last shot dropped the moose stone dead.    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE IN ALLAGASH STREAM.    (St. John Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]    On another occasion, a sportsman, to show his contempt for Maine's  prohibition law, got gloriously full every day before ten o'clock.    The guide left him in the canoe one afternoon while he went ashore to look  for some game signs on a bog near at hand. As he was returning he saw a  nice moose step out of cover within ridiculously easy rifle shot of the  sportsman. The sportsman at once opened fire on the moose, but after many  shots the animal trotted off, untouched.    \"'T was this haway,\" said the bibulous hunter, in explaining his misses,  \"when that moose came out there was only one, all right enough, but when I  cut loose with the old gun, blame if the moose didn't double up into two. I  couldn't shoot both at once, and while I was pumping it into one the other  got away. Mus' ha' been I shot at the wrong moose.\"    [Illustration: BULL AND COW MOOSE.    Photographed from Life.]    \"You want to hear how my sports shoot?\" said another native guide. \"Wel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#5)"],[1,"us. Our place is simply monstrous.\"    For all that, one doesn't buy vegetables to take to Sardinia.    Cross the Corso at that decorated maelstrom and death-trap of the  Quattro Canti. I, of course, am nearly knocked down and killed. Somebody  is nearly knocked down and killed every two minutes. But there--the  carriages are light, and the horses curiously aware creatures. They  would never tread on one.    The second part of the Via Maqueda is the swell part: silks and plumes,  and an infinite number of shirts and ties and cuff-links and mufflers  and men's fancies. One realises here that man-drapery and man-underwear  is quite as important as woman's, if not more.    I, of course, in a rage. The q-b stares at every rag and stitch, and  crosses and re-crosses this infernal dark stream of a Via Maqueda,  which, as I have said, is choked solid with strollers and carriages. Be  it remembered that I have on my back the brown knapsack, and the q-b  carries the kitchenino. This is enough to make a travelling menagerie  of us. If I had my shirt sticking out behind, and if the q-b had  happened merely to catch up the table-cloth and wrap it round her as she  came out, all well and good. But a big brown knapsack! And a basket with  thermos flask, etc! No, one could not expect such things to pass in a  southern capital.    But I am case-hardened. And I am sick of shops. True, we have not been  in a town for three months. But _can_ I care for the innumerable  _fantasias_ in the drapery line? Every wretched bit of would-be-extra  chic is called a fantasia. The word goes lugubriously to my bowels.    Suddenly I am aware of the q-b darting past me like a storm. Suddenly I  see her pouncing on three giggling young hussies just in front--the  inevitable black velveteen tam, the inevitable white curly muffler, the  inevitable lower-class flappers. \"Did you want something? Have you  something to say? Is there something that amuses you? Oh-h! You must  laugh, must you? Oh--laugh! Oh-h! Why? Why? You ask why? Haven't I heard  you! Oh--you spik Ingleesh! You spik Ingleesh! Yes--why! That's why!  Yes, that's why.\"    The three giggling young hussies shrink together as if they would all  hide behind one another, after a vain uprearing and a demand why? Madam  tells them why. So they uncomfortably squeeze together under the  unexpected strokes of the q-b's sledge-hammer Italian and more than  sledge-hammer retaliation, there full in the Via Maqueda. They edge  round one another, each attempting to get back of the other, away from  the looming q-b. I perceive that this rotary motion is equivalent to a  standstill, so feel called upon to say something in the manly line.    \"Beastly Palermo bad-manners,\" I say, and throw a nonchalant \"Ignoranti\"  at the end, in a tone of dismissal.    Which does it. Off they go down-stream, still huddling and shrinking  like boats that are taking sails in, and peeping to see if we are  coming. Yes, my dears, we are coming.    \"Why do you bother?\" say I to the q-b, who is towering with rage.    \"They've followed us the whole length of the street--with their _sacco  militario_ and their _parlano inglese_ and their _you spik Ingleesh_,  and their jeering insolence. But the English are fools. They always put  up with this Italian impudence.\"    Which is perhaps true.--But this knapsack! It might be full of  bronze-roaring geese, it would not attract more attention!    However, and however, it is seven o'clock, and the shops are beginning  to shut. No more shop-gazing. Only one lovely place: raw ham, boiled  ham, chickens in aspic, chicken vol-au-vents, sweet curds, curd-cheese,  rustic cheese-cake, smoked sausages, beautiful fresh mortadella, huge  Mediterranean red lobsters, and those lobsters without claws. \"So good!  So good!\" We stand and cry it aloud.    But this shop too is shutting. I ask a man for the Hotel Pantechnico.  And treating me in that gentle, strangely tender southern manner, he  takes me and shows me. He makes me feel such a poor, frail, helpless  leaf. A foreigner, you know. A bit of an imbecile, poor dear. Hold his  hand and show him the way.           *       *       *       *       *    To sit in the room of this young American woman, with its blue hangings,  and talk and drink tea till midnght! Ah these naive Americans--they are  a good deal older and shrewder than we, once it nears the point. And  they all seem to feel as if the world were coming to an end. And they  are so truly generous of their hospitality, in this cold world.          II.    THE SEA.      The fat old porter knocks. Ah me, once more it is dark. Get up again  before dawn. A dark sky outside, cloudy. The thrilling tinkle of  innumerable goat-bells as the first flock enters the city, such a  rippling sound. Well, it must be morning, even if one shivers at it. And  at least it does not rain.           *       *       *       *       *    That pale, bluish, theatrical light outside, of the first dawn. And a  cold wind. We come on to the wide, desolate quay, the curve of the  harbour Panormus. That horrible dawn-pallor of a cold sea out there. And  here, port mud, greasy: and fish: and refuse. The American girl is with  us, wrapped in her sweater. A coarse, cold, black-slimy world, she seems  as if she would melt away before it. But these frail creatures, what a  lot they can go through!    [Illustration: MAP FOR SEA AND SARDINIA]    Across the great, wide, badly paved, mud-greasy, despairing road of the  quay side, and to the sea. There lies our steamer, over there in the  dawn-dusk of the basin, half visible. \"That one who is smoking her  cigarette,\" says the porter. She looks little, beside the huge _City of  Trieste_ who is lying up next her.           *       *       *       *       *    Our row-boat is hemmed in by many empty boats, huddled to the side of  the quay. She works her way out like a sheepdog working his way out of a  flock of sheep, or like a boat through pack-ice. We are on the open  basin. The rower stands up and pushes the oars from him. He gives a  long, melancholy cry to someone on the quay. The water goes chock-chock  against the urging bows. The wind is chill. The fantastic peaks behind  Palermo show half-ghostly in a half-dark sky. The dawn seems reluctant  to come. Our steamer still smokes her cigarette--meaning the  funnel-smoke--across there. So, one sits still, and crosses the level  space of half-dark water. Masts of sailing-ships, and spars, cluster on  the left, on the undarkening sky.           *       *       *       *       *    Climb up, climb up, this is our ship. Up we go, up the ladder. \"Oh but!\"  says the American girl. \"Isn't she small! Isn't she impossibly small! Oh  my, will you go in such a little thing? Oh dear! Thirty two hours in  such a little boat? Why no, I wouldn't care for it at all.\"    A bunch of stewards, cooks, waiters, engineers, pan-cleaners and  what-not, mostly in black canvas jackets. Nobody else on the ship. A  little black bunch of loutish crew with nothing to do, and we the first  passengers served up to be jeered at. There you are, in the grey light.    \"Who is going?\"    \"We two--the signorina is not going.\"    \"Tickets!\"    These are casual proletarian manners.    We are taken into the one long room with a long table and many  maple-golden doors, alternate panels having a wedge-wood blue-and-white  picture inserted--a would-be Goddess of white marble on a blue ground,  like a health-salts Hygeia advertisement. One of the plain panels  opens--our cabin.    \"Oh dear! Why it isn't as big as a china-closet. However will you get  in!\" cries the American girl.    \"One at a time,\" say I.    \"But it's the tiniest place I _ever_ saw.\"    It really was tiny. One had to get into a bunk to shut the door. That  did not matter to me, I am no Titanic American. I pitched the knapsack  on one bunk, the kitchenino on the other, and we shut the door. The  cabin disappeared into a maple-wood panel of the long, subterranean  state-room.    \"Why, is this the only place you've got to sit in?\" cried the American  girl. \"But how perfectly awful! No air, and so dark, and smelly. Why I  never saw such a boat! Will you really go? Will you really!\"    The state-room was truly rather subterranean and stuffy, with nothing  but a long table and an uncanny company of screw-pin chairs seated  thereat, and no outlet to the air at all, but it was not so bad  otherwise, to me who have never been out of Europe. Those maple-wood  panels and ebony curves--and those Hygeias! They went all round, even  round the curve at the dim, distant end, and back up the near side. Yet  how beautiful old, gold-coloured maple-wood is! how very lovely, with  the ebony curves of the door arch! There was a wonderful old-fashioned,  Victorian glow in it, and a certain splendour. Even one could bear the  Hygeias let in under glass--the colour was right, that wedge-wood and  white, in such lovely gold lustre. There was a certain homely grandeur  still in the days when this ship was built: a richness of choice  material. And health-salts Hygeias, wedge-wood Greek goddesses on  advertisement placards! Yet they _weren't_ advertisements. That was  what really worried me. They never had been. Perhaps Weego's Health  Salts stole her later.           *       *       *       *       *    We have no coffee--that goes without saying. Nothing doing so early. The  crew still stands in a gang, exactly like a gang of louts at a  street-corner. And they've got the street all to themselves--this ship.  We climb to the upper deck.           *       *       *       *       *    She is a long, slender, old steamer with one little funnel. And she  seems so deserted, now that one can't see the street-corner gang of the  casual crew. They are just below. Our ship is deserted.    The dawn is wanly blueing. The sky is a curdle of cloud, there is a bit  of pale gold eastwards, beyond Monte Pellegrino. The wind blows across  the"]]]
