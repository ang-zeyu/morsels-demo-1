[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/353"],[0,"In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems (#5)"],[1,"the orders, blew \"Lights out\",--on a cavalry trumpet.  The sappers work by night. The officer turned and went his way to his  accursed trenches, leaving the verse with me.    John McCrae witnessed only once the raw earth of Flanders hide its  shame in the warm scarlet glory of the poppy. Others have watched this  resurrection of the flowers in four successive seasons, a fresh miracle  every time it occurs. Also they have observed the rows of crosses  lengthen, the torch thrown, caught, and carried to victory. The dead may  sleep. We have not broken faith with them.    It is little wonder then that \"In Flanders Fields\" has become the poem  of the army. The soldiers have learned it with their hearts, which is  quite a different thing from committing it to memory. It circulates,  as a song should circulate, by the living word of mouth, not by printed  characters. That is the true test of poetry,--its insistence on making  itself learnt by heart. The army has varied the text; but each variation  only serves to reveal more clearly the mind of the maker. The army  says, \"AMONG the crosses\"; \"felt dawn AND sunset glow\"; \"LIVED and were  loved\". The army may be right: it usually is.    Nor has any piece of verse in recent years been more widely known in the  civilian world. It was used on every platform from which men were being  adjured to adventure their lives or their riches in the great trial  through which the present generation has passed. Many \"replies\" have  been made. The best I have seen was written in the 'New York Evening  Post'. None but those who were prepared to die before Vimy Ridge that  early April day of 1916 will ever feel fully the great truth of Mr.  Lillard's opening lines, as they speak for all Americans:       \"Rest ye in peace, ye Flanders dead.      The fight that ye so bravely led            We've taken up.\"    They did--and bravely. They heard the cry--\"If ye break faith, we shall  not sleep.\"          II. With the Guns      If there was nothing remarkable about the publication of \"In Flanders  Fields\", there was something momentous in the moment of writing it.  And yet it was a sure instinct which prompted the writer to send it to  'Punch'. A rational man wishes to know the news of the world in which he  lives; and if he is interested in life, he is eager to know how men feel  and comport themselves amongst the events which are passing. For this  purpose 'Punch' is the great newspaper of the world, and these lines  describe better than any other how men felt in that great moment.    It was in April, 1915. The enemy was in the full cry of victory. All  that remained for him was to occupy Paris, as once he did before, and  to seize the Channel ports. Then France, England, and the world were  doomed. All winter the German had spent in repairing his plans, which  had gone somewhat awry on the Marne. He had devised his final stroke,  and it fell upon the Canadians at Ypres. This battle, known as the  second battle of Ypres, culminated on April 22nd, but it really extended  over the whole month.    The inner history of war is written from the recorded impressions of men  who have endured it. John McCrae in a series of letters to his mother,  cast in the form of a diary, has set down in words the impressions which  this event of the war made upon a peculiarly sensitive mind. The  account is here transcribed without any attempt at \"amplification\", or  \"clarifying\" by notes upon incidents or references to places. These are  only too well known.        Friday, April 23rd, 1915.    As we moved up last evening, there was heavy firing about 4.30 on our  left, the hour at which the general attack with gas was made when the  French line broke. We could see the shells bursting over Ypres, and in  a small village to our left, meeting General----, C.R.A., of one of  the divisions, he ordered us to halt for orders. We sent forward  notifications to our Headquarters, and sent out orderlies to get in  touch with the batteries of the farther forward brigades already in  action. The story of these guns will be read elsewhere. They had a tough  time, but got away safely, and did wonderful service. One battery fired  in two opposite directions at once, and both batteries fired at point  blank, open sights, at Germans in the open. They were at times quite  without infantry on their front, for their position was behind the  French to the left of the British line.    As we sat on the road we began to see the French stragglers--men without  arms, wounded men, teams, wagons, civilians, refugees--some by the  roads, some across country, all talking, shouting--the very picture of  debacle. I must say they were the \"tag enders\" of a fighting line rather  than the line itself. They streamed on, and shouted to us scraps of not  too inspiriting information while we stood and took our medicine, and  picked out gun positions in the fields in case we had to go in there  and then. The men were splendid; not a word; not a shake, and it was a  terrific test. Traffic whizzed by--ambulances, transport, ammunition,  supplies, despatch riders--and the shells thundered into the town, or  burst high in the air nearer us, and the refugees streamed. Women,  old men, little children, hopeless, tearful, quiet or excited, tired,  dodging the traffic,--and the wounded in singles or in groups. Here and  there I could give a momentary help, and the ambulances picked up as  they could. So the cold moonlight night wore on--no change save that the  towers of Ypres showed up against the glare of the city burning; and the  shells still sailed in.    At 9.30 our ammunition column (the part that had been \"in\") appeared.  Major---- had waited, like Casabianca, for orders until the Germans were  500 yards away; then he started, getting safely away save for one wagon  lost, and some casualties in men and horses. He found our column, and we  prepared to send forward ammunition as soon as we could learn where the  batteries had taken up position in retiring, for retire they had to.  Eleven, twelve, and finally grey day broke, and we still waited. At  3.45 word came to go in and support a French counterattack at 4.30 A.M.  Hastily we got the order spread; it was 4 A.M. and three miles to go.    Of one's feelings all this night--of the asphyxiated French soldiers--of  the women and children--of the cheery, steady British reinforcements  that moved up quietly past us, going up, not back--I could write, but  you can imagine.    We took the road at once, and went up at the gallop. The Colonel rode  ahead to scout a position (we had only four guns, part of the ammunition  column, and the brigade staff; the 1st and 4th batteries were back in  reserve at our last billet). Along the roads we went, and made our place  on time, pulled up for ten minutes just short of the position, where I  put Bonfire [his horse] with my groom in a farmyard, and went forward on  foot--only a quarter of a mile or so--then we advanced. Bonfire had soon  to move; a shell killed a horse about four yards away from him, and he  wisely took other ground. Meantime we went on into the position we were  to occupy for seventeen days, though we could not guess that. I can  hardly say more than that it was near the Yser Canal.    We got into action at once, under heavy gunfire. We were to the left  entirely of the British line, and behind French troops, and so we  remained for eight days. A Colonel of the R.A., known to fame, joined  us and camped with us; he was our link with the French Headquarters, and  was in local command of the guns in this locality. When he left us eight  days later he said, \"I am glad to get out of this hell-hole.\" He was a  great comfort to us, for he is very capable, and the entire battle was  largely fought \"on our own\", following the requests of the Infantry on  our front, and scarcely guided by our own staff at all. We at once set  out to register our targets, and almost at once had to get into steady  firing on quite a large sector of front. We dug in the guns as quickly  as we could, and took as Headquarters some infantry trenches already  sunk on a ridge near the canal. We were subject from the first to a  steady and accurate shelling, for we were all but in sight, as were the  German trenches about 2000 yards to our front. At times the fire would  come in salvos quickly repeated. Bursts of fire would be made for ten  or fifteen minutes at a time. We got all varieties of projectile, from  3 inch to 8 inch, or perhaps 10 inch; the small ones usually as air  bursts, the larger percussion and air, and the heaviest percussion only.    My work began almost from the start--steady but never overwhelming,  except perhaps once for a few minutes. A little cottage behind our ridge  served as a cook-house, but was so heavily hit the second day that we  had to be chary of it. During bursts of fire I usually took the back  slope of the sharply crested ridge for what shelter it offered. At 3 our  1st and 4th arrived, and went into action at once a few hundred yards in  our rear. Wires were at once put out, to be cut by shells hundreds and  hundreds of times, but always repaired by our indefatigable linemen.  So the day wore on; in the night the shelling still kept up: three  different German attacks were made and repulsed. If we suffered by  being close up, the Germans suffered from us, for already tales of good  shooting came down to us. I got some sleep despite the constant firing,  for we had none last night.        Saturday, April 24th, 1915.    Behold us now anything less than two miles north of Ypres on the west  side of the canal; this runs north, each bank flanked with high elms,  with bare trunks of the familiar Netherlands type. A few yards to the  West a main road runs, likewise bordered; the Censor will allow me to  say that on the high bank between these we had our headquarters; the  ridge is perhaps fifteen to twenty feet high, and slopes forward fifty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#5)"],[1,"  wood toward them, and a carriage had halted at the side of the road,  while a group of schoolboys, headed by Johnny, the bell ringer, were  hurrying down the slope toward the water's edge.    \"They're beginning to gather,\" the physician said, grimly. \"Well, it's  human nature, and your brother had a host of friends, Mr. Brierly.\"    Robert Brierly set his lips and averted his face for a moment.    \"Doran,\" called the doctor. \"Come here, will you.\"    Doran, who had begun to push the shining wheel up the slope, placed it  carefully against a tree and came toward them, the doctor meanwhile  turning to Brierly.    \"Mr. Brierly, you are a stranger here. Will you let me arrange for you?\"    The other nodded, and then said huskily: \"But it hurts to take him to an  undertaker's!\"    \"He shall not be taken there,\" and the doctor turned to Doran, now  standing at the wheel.    \"Mr. Doran, will you take my keys and ride ahead as fast as possible?  Tell the undertaker, as you pass, to drive to my house. Then go on and  open it. We will put the body in the private office. Do not remonstrate,  Mr. Brierly. It is only what I would wish another to do for me and mine  in a like affliction.\" And this was the rule by which this man lived his  life, and because of which death had no terrors.    \"I am a bachelor, you must know,\" the doctor said, as they drove slowly  in the wake of the hearse. \"And I have made my home and established my  office in a cosy cottage near the village proper. It will save you the  ordeal of strange eyes, and many questions, perhaps, if you will be my  guest for a day or two, at least.\"    Robert Brierly turned and looked this friend in need full in the face  for a moment; then he lifted his hand to brush a sudden moisture from  his eye.    \"I accept all your kindness,\" he said, huskily, \"for I see that you are  as sincere as you are kind.\"    When the body of Charles Brierly had been carried in and placed as it  must remain until the inquest was at an end, and when the crowd of  sorrowing, anxious and curious people had dispersed, the doctor, who was  masterful at need, making Doran his lieutenant, arranged for the  securing of a jury; and, after giving some quiet instructions, sent him  away, saying:    \"Tell the people it is not yet determined how or when we shall hold the  inquiry. Miss Grant, who must be a witness, will hardly be able to  appear at once, I fear,\" for, after looking to his guest's bodily  comfort, the doctor had left him to be alone with his grief for a little  while, and had paid a flying visit to Hilda Grant, who lived nearly  three blocks away.    When at length the little house was quiet, and when the doctor and his  heavy-hearted companion had made a pretence of partaking of luncheon,  the former, having shut and locked the door upon the elderly African who  served him, drew his chair close to that of his guest, and said:    \"Are you willing to take counsel with me, Mr. Brierly? And are you quite  fit and ready to talk about what is most important?\"    \"I am most anxious for your advice, and for information.\"    \"Then, let us lose no time; there is much to be done.\"    \"Doctor,\" Robert Brierly bent toward the other and placed a hand upon  his knee. \"There are emergencies which bring men together and reveal  them, each to each, in a flash, as it were. I cannot feel that you know  me really; but I know you, and would trust you with my dearest  possession, or my most dangerous secret. You will be frank with me, I  know, if you speak at all; and I want you to tell me something.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"You have told me how, in your opinion, my poor brother really met his  death. Will you put yourself in my place, and tell me how you would act  in this horrible emergency? What is the first thing you would do?\"    The doctor's answer came after a moment's grave thought.    \"I am, I think, a Christian,\" he said, gravely, \"but I think--bah! I  know that I would make my life's work to find out the truth about that  murder, for that it was a murder, I solemnly believe.\"          CHAPTER IV.    FERRARS.      Robert Brierly caught his breath.    \"And your reason?\" he gasped, \"for you have a reason other than the mere  fact of the bullet-wound in the neck.\"    \"I have seen just such deeds in the wild west and I know how they are  done. But this is also professional knowledge. Besides, man, call reason  to your aid! Oh, I expect too much. The hurt is too fresh, you can only  feel now, but the man shot by accident, be it by his own hand or that of  another, is not shot twice.\"    \"Good heavens, no!\"    \"But when one who creeps upon his victim unawares, shoots him from  behind, and, as he falls, fearing the work is not completed, shoots  again, the victim, as you must see, receives the wound further to the  front as the body falls forward and partially turns in falling. Do you  see? Do you comprehend?\"    \"Yes.\" Brierly shuddered.    \"Brierly, this talk is hurting you cruelly. Let us drop details, or  postpone them.\"    \"Not the essential ones. I must bear what I must. Go on, doctor. I quite  agree with you. It looks like a murder, and we must--I must know the  truth--must find the one who did the deed. Doctor, advise me.\"    \"About----\"    \"How to begin, no time should be lost.\"    \"That means a good detective, as soon as possible. Do you chance to know  any of these gentry?\"    \"I----No, indeed! I suppose a telegram to the chief of police----\"    \"Allow me,\" broke in Doctor Barnes. \"May I make a suggestion?\"    \"Anything. I seem unable to think.\"    \"And no wonder! I know the right man for you if he is in Chicago. You  see, I was in hospital practice for several years, and have also had my  share of prison experience. While thus employed I met a man named  Ferrars, an Englishman, who for some years has spent the greater part of  his time in this country, in Chicago, in fact. There's a mystery and a  romance attached to the man, or his history. He's not connected with  any of the city offices, but he is one of three retired  detectives--retired, that is, from regular work--who work together at  need when they feel a case to be worth their efforts. I think a case  like this will be certain to attract Ferrars.\"    \"And he is your choice of the three?\"    The doctor smiled. \"The others are married,\" he said, \"and not so ready  to go far afield as is Ferrars.\"    \"You think him skilful?\"    \"None better.\"    \"Then, do you know his address?\"    Brierly got up and began to walk about, his eyes beginning to glow with  the excitement so long suppressed. \"Because we can't get him here too  soon.\"    \"I agree with you. And now one thing more. To give him every advantage  he should not be known, and the inquest should not begin until he is  here.\"    \"Can that be managed?\"    \"I think so.\"    Brierly was now nervously eager. He seemed to have shaken off the stupor  which at first had seemed to seize upon and hold him, and his questions  and suggestions came thick and fast. It ended, of course, in his putting  himself into the doctor's hands, and accepting his plans and suggestions  entirely. And very soon, Dr. Barnes, having given his factotum distinct  instructions as regarded visitors, and inquiries, had set off, his  medicine case carried ostentatiously in his hand, not for the telegraph  office, but for the cottage, close by, where Hilda Grant found a home.    It was a small, neatly-kept cottage, and Mrs. Marcy, a gentle, kindly  widow, and the young teacher were its only occupants.    The widow met him at the door, her face anxious, her voice the merest  whisper.    \"Doctor, tell me; do you think she will really be ill?\"    \"Why no, Mrs. Marcy; at least not for long. It has been a shock, of  course; a great shock. But she----\"    \"Ah, doctor, she is heart-broken. I--I think I surely may tell you. It  will help you to understand. They were engaged, and for a little while,  such a pitiful little while it seems now, they have been so happy.\"    The doctor was silent a moment, his eyes turned away.    \"And now,\" went on the good woman, \"she will be lonelier than ever. You  know she was very lonely here at first. She has no relatives nearer than  a cousin anywhere in the world, to her knowledge. And he has never been  to see her. He lives in Chicago, too, not so far away.\"    \"Yes, surely he ought to visit her now, really. Just ask her if I may  come up, Mrs. Marcy. I--I'm glad you told me of this. Thank you. It will  help me.\"    Ten minutes later Doctor Barnes was hastening toward the telegraph  office, where he sent away this singular and wordy message:           \"Frank Ferrars, No. ... Street, Chicago--         \"Your cousin, Miss Hilda Grant, is ill, and in trouble. It is a       case in which you are needed as much as I. Come, if possible, by       first evening train.         \"WALTER BARNES.\"      \"That will fetch him,\" he mused, as he hastened homeward. \"Ferrars never  breaks a promise, though I little expected to have to remind him of it  within the year.\"    \"Well,\" began Brierly, when he entered his own door. \"Have you seen her?  Was she willing?\"    \"Willing and anxious. She is a brave and sensible little woman. She will  do her part, and she has never for one moment believed in the theory of  an accident.\"    \"And she will receive me?\"    \"This evening. She insists that we hold our council there, in her  presence. At first I objected, on account of her weakness, but she is  right in her belief that we should be most secure there, and Ferrars  should not be seen abroad to-night. We will have to take Mrs. Marcy into  our confidence, in part at least, but she can be trusted. We will all be  observed, more or less, for a few days. But, of course, I shall put  Ferrars up for the night. That will be the thing to do after he has  spent a short evening with his cousin.\"    Brierly once more began his restless pacing to and fro, turning  presently to compare his watch with the doctor's Dutch clock.
