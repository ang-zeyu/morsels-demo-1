Eight of the 11 Mexican species that are considered as Big Game are  recorded from the state. Until this century Tamaulipas was not densely  populated by man either in the pre-colonial period or thereafter.  Therefore many species of game are still relatively abundant.    Of the eight species that originally lived in Tamaulipas, the mule  deer, brocket, and black bear never have been abundant there and now  are in danger of extirpation. The pronghorn was also rare in the state  and now has been extirpated as it has been in many other parts of  Mexico. The white-tailed deer, javalin, jaguar, and puma are still  abundant in suitable habitats. The white-tailed deer is found almost  everywhere in the state; in some areas it damages cornfields, and for  this reason is killed by natives who eat the meat and sell the skins.  The price of skins is low; in 1959 at Ciudad Mante tanners paid natives  less than one dollar (10.00 Mexican pesos) per hide. Some idea of the  abundance of deer in Tamaulipas is provided by our having found in one  tanner's shop, in 1959 at Ciudad Mante, about 500 deer skins. Besides  these, we found about 65 skins of other species--jaguar, bear, ocelot,  puma, margay, and raccoon. Additionally there was a large number of  coati skins. Considering that Mexico has no professional trappers and  that commerce in skins of wild animals is illegal, it is felt that the  number of skins found in the tanner's shop indicated a relative large  population of game mammals.    The number of species of small game also is large. Some species are  killed by natives for food, but most are killed in order to protect the  cultivated crops, which are injured mainly by rabbits and squirrels.    Baker (1958) pointed out that the future of the game species in the  northern part of Mexico was not encouraging. He gave valid reasons for  his view. In Tamaulipas, however, in some respects the outlook is more  encouraging because there are many areas in which with a minimum of  effort the authorities can save a good number of species.    As Baker (_op. cit._) remarked, the fauna in Mexico is declining mainly  because many areas recently have been cultivated for the first time.  Also, better roads have enabled hunters to reach areas that formerly  were natural refuges for wild animals. Many times it has been said that  the populations of wild animals were declining in Mexico because the  number of game wardens is too small to protect game in all parts of the  country. In some ways this is true but it seems that the problem is  really one of education. The people do not realize that the animals are  part of nature and therefore have the same right to live that man has.  Most people see only the bad side of the animals' activities and never  consider the benefit that wild mammals provide for man. A typical case  is that of the coyote, which is oftentimes killed only because it is a  coyote. Sometimes individual coyotes do kill domestic animals, but the  people seem never to understand that the coyote destroys a large number  of mice, rabbits, and insects as has been shown by studies of the  contents of coyote stomachs.    The Mexican Government at this time is making a concentrated effort to  provide schools in all parts of the country and is formulating new  programs of education. In this official program some lectures in  conservation are needed with reference to the animal life. I know that  some education now is given to people with respect to conservation of  the water, soil, and forest, but gather that there is little that  covers also conservation of animals.    I do not deny the necessity for some natives to kill wild animals.  People need to eat fresh meat and for some it is almost impossible to  obtain meat in any other way than by killing wild animals. Some natives  cannot afford to purchase meat in the markets or they live too far from  any village or city to do so. Also, natives need to protect their  cultivated areas; some of them have only four to six acres of land, on  which corn is the only crop. When one deer in a night can destroy part  of the corn, and in some areas not only one deer but several invade a  field, and when one considers that besides deer there are rabbits,  squirrels, raccoons, and coati, to name only some animals that feed on  the corn, we find that the small cornfield at the end of the season may  not contain any corn to harvest. It is understandable, therefore, that  the natives kill the animals. In this way they protect their cultivated  fields, obtain food and sometimes money for the skins. Many natives,  however, destroy the wildlife only for pleasure or to obtain money for  skins and meat, which sometimes is sold to restaurants.    Probably the best solution for the problem of conservation of wild  animals is the establishment of wildlife refuges. In Tamaulipas, at  least three refuges are needed in order to preserve the mammalian  wildlife. These areas would serve also as a refuge for game birds and  other vertebrates. A large area with suitable habitat for white-tailed  deer, brocket, jaguar, puma, javalin, and fox could be established in  the Sierra de Tamaulipas, which presents favorable habitat for all of  the species named. A second area that does not need to be so large as  the first could be established in the Sierra Madre Oriental, probably  including some part of Nuevo Leon, where the black bear and the mule  deer find suitable habitat. Probably the beaver can be introduced in  the streams of the high mountains; beaver live in the same Sierra a  little farther north in Nuevo Leon. The three species mentioned are in  imminent danger of disappearing from Tamaulipas, if they have not  already disappeared. The third refuge could be in some area of the  northern part of the state near the Rio Grande. This refuge should give  protection to the beaver--a rare animal in Mexico and in danger of  extirpation over all the country. The pronghorn also would find  suitable habitat in this area, but would have to be reintroduced there.  With the establishment of these three refuges and with good management  the fauna of Tamaulipas could be saved from extinction, would provide  some recreation for sportsmen, and especially for the people in general  who wish to study, photograph, or merely observe the native animal  life.    The time is excellent for the establishment of the wildlife refuges in  Tamaulipas because large areas are still in Federal ownership and  because a considerable number of animals remain. Other favorable  factors are that roads are not yet good in the areas proposed for  refuges, the human population is low, and agriculture consequently is  not practiced. But, with the rapid increase in population in Mexico,  these favorable conditions will change in a few years and it will be  almost impossible to establish the refuges then.          METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      The families, genera, and species recorded in this report are arranged  following Hall and Kelson (1959). Subspecies are in alphabetical order  under the species. Remarks are given on natural history in each species  account, if information is available. Discussion of subspecies known  from the state is included. Under each subspecies, the citation to the  original description is given with mention of type locality. Next is  the citation to the first usage of the current name-combination. Then,  synonyms are listed if there be such in the sense that original  descriptions of the alleged species or subspecies had type localities  in Tamaulipas.    Measurements, unless otherwise noted, are of adults and are given in  millimeters. External measurements are in the following order: total  length; length of tail vertebrae; length of hind foot; length of ear  from notch. Capitalized color terms are those of Ridgway, Color  Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912. Capital  letters designate teeth in the upper jaws and lower case letters  designate teeth in the lower jaws; for example, M2 refers to the second  upper molar and m2 refers to the second lower molar.    The localities of specimens examined and additional records are listed  from north to south and their geographic positions can be found in the  gazetteer and on the map (Fig. 4).

The graph shows differential survival  according to time of birth. Individuals born in autumn seem to have a  longer life expectancy. The numbers on the lines refer to months of  first capture.]    A study of the age groups in each month's population revealed a  differential survival based on the season of birth. Blair (1948:405)  found that chances of survival in _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ were  approximately equal throughout the year. In the present populations of  _M. ochrogaster_, however, voles born in October, November, December and  January tended to live longer than those born in other months (Fig. 3).  Presumably these animals, born in autumn and early winter, were more  vigorous than their older competitors and were therefore better able to  survive the shrinking habitat of winter. Their continued survival after  large numbers of younger voles had been added to the population probably  was permitted by the expanding habitat of spring and summer. The  percentage of the population surviving the winter of 1951-1952 was  approximately double the percentage surviving the winter of 1950-1951.  This difference seemed to be due to the smaller population entering the  winter of 1951-1952 rather than any major difference in the  environmental resistance.    As a consequence of the differential survival, most of the breeding  population in the spring was made up of animals born the previous  October and November. Fig. 4 shows that in February, when the percentage  of breeding females ordinarily began to rise, 51.6 per cent of the  population was born in the previous October and November. Voles born in  these two months continued to form a large part of the population  through March (45.1 per cent), April (38.5 per cent), May (23.9 per  cent), June (18.7 per cent) and July (16.2 per cent) (Fig. 4). These  percentages suggest that the habitat conditions in October and November  were probably important in determining the population level for at least  the first half of the next year.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Differential survival of voles according to month  when first caught. Each column represents the percentage of the monthly  sample first caught in each of the preceding months. Those voles caught  first in October and November survived longer than those first caught in  other months. Relatively few individuals remained in the population as  long as one year.]          POPULATION DENSITY      Population densities were ascertained on the study areas by means of the  live-trapping program. Blair (1948:396) stated that almost all small  mammals old enough to leave the nest (except shrews and moles) are  captured by live-trapping. My experience, and that of other workers on  the Reservation, requires modification of such a statement. The distance  between traps is an important factor in determining the efficiency of  live-trapping. As mentioned earlier, when House Field and Quarry Field  were trapped out at the conclusion of the live-trapping program no  unmarked voles were taken. This showed that the 30 foot interval between  traps was short enough to cover the area as far as _Microtus_ was  concerned. The fact that unmarked adults were caught almost entirely in  marginal traps is additional evidence. On the other hand, the Fitch  traps were 50 feet apart and voles seemed to have lived within the grid  for several months before being captured. Fitch (1954:39) has shown that  some kinds of small mammals are missed in a live-trapping program  because of variation in bait acceptance, both seasonal and specific.    A few individuals, missed in a trapping period, were captured again in  subsequent months. These voles were assumed to have been present during  the month in which they were not caught. The area actually trapped each  month was estimated by a modification of the method proposed by Stickel  (1946:153). The average maximum move was calculated each month and a  strip one half the average maximum move in width was added to each side  of the study area actually covered by traps. The study plots were  bounded in part by gravel roads and forest edge acting as barriers, and  for these parts no marginal strip was added. Trap lines on the opposite  sides of these roads rarely caught marked voles that had crossed in  either direction. It is perhaps advisable to say here that the size of  House Field and Quarry Field study plots (0.56 acres) was too small for  best results in estimating population levels (Blair, 1941:149). In the  computations of population levels the data for males and females were  combined, because no significant difference between the average maximum  move of the sexes was apparent.    Fluctuations of the populations were graphed in terms of individuals per  acre (Fig. 5). The variation was great in the 30 month period for which  data were available, and was both chronological and topographical. The  lowest density recorded was 25.2 individuals per acre and the highest  density was 145.8 individuals per acre. The weight varied from a low of  847 grams per acre to a high of 5275 grams per acre.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. Variations in density of voles from three  populations, as shown by live-trapping, and the mean density of these  populations. Juveniles are not represented in their true numbers since  many voles were caught first as subadults. The samples from the Fitch  trap line were incomplete due to the wide spacing of the traps.]    There are few records of density of _M. ochrogaster_ in the literature.  Brumwell (1951:213) found nine individuals per acre in a prairie on the  Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation and Wooster (1939:515) reported  38.5 individuals per acre for _M. o. haydeni_ in a mixed prairie in  west-central Kansas. High densities for _M. pennsylvanicus_ reported in  the literature include 29.8 individuals per acre (Blair, 1948:404), 118  individuals per acre (Bole, 1939:69), 160-230 individuals per acre  (Hamilton, 1937b:781) and 67 individuals per acre (Townsend, 1935:97).    Because the study period included one period of unusually high rainfall  and one year of unusually low rainfall, the normal pattern of seasonal  variation of population density was obscured. An examination of the data  suggested, however, that the greatest densities were reached in October  and November with a second high point in the April-May-June period.  These high points generally followed the periods of high levels of  breeding activity (Fig. 8). The autumn rise in population may have been  due, in part, to the addition of spring and early summer litters to the  breeding population, but the rise occurred too late in the year to be  explained by that alone. Another factor may have been the spurt in  growth of grasses occurring in Kansas in early autumn, in September and  October. There was a seeming correlation between high rainfall with  rapid growth of grasses and reproductive activity, and, secondarily with  high population densities of voles. These relationships are discussed in  connection with reproduction. Lowest annual densities were found to  occur in January when there is but little breeding activity and when  rainfall is low and plant growth has ceased.    Marked deviation from the usual seasonal trends accompanied flood and  drought. In the flood of July, 1951, although the study areas were not  inundated, the ground was saturated to the extent that every footprint  at once became a puddle. Immediately after the floods, on all three  areas studied, populations were found to have been drastically reduced.  The effect was most severe on the population of House Field, the lowest  area studied, and the recovery of the population there was much slower  than that of those on the other study areas (Fig. 5). Newborn voles were  killed by the saturated condition of the ground in which they lay. The  more precocious young of _Sigmodon hispidus_ survived wetting better.  They thus acquired an advantage in the competitive relationship between  cotton rats and voles. These relationships are discussed more fully in  the section on mammalian associates of _Microtus_.    Adverse effects of heavy rainfall on populations of small mammals have  been reported by Blair (1939) and others. Goodpastor and Hoffmeister  (1952:370) reported that inundation sharply reduced populations of _M.  ochrogaster_ for a year after flooding but that the area was then  reoccupied by a large population of voles. Such a reoccupation may have  begun on the areas of this study in the spring of 1952 when the upward  trend of the population was abruptly reversed by drought. While cotton  rats were abundant their competition may have been an important factor  in depressing population levels of voles. The population of voles began  to rise only after the population of cotton rats had decreased (Fig.  19).    In the unusually dry summer of 1952, there was a marked decline of  population levels beginning in June and continuing to August when my  field work was terminated. Dr. Fitch (1953, _in litt._) informed me that  the decline continued through the winter of 1952-53 and into the summer  of 1953, until daily catches of _Microtus_ on the Reservation were  reduced to 2-10 per cent of the number caught on the same trap lines in  the summer of 1951. The drought seemed to affect population levels by  inhibiting reproduction, as described elsewhere in this report. A  similar sensitivity to drought was reported by Wooster (1935:352) who  found _M. o. haydeni_ decreased more than any other species of small  mammal after the great drought of the thirties.    No evidence of cycles in _M. ochrogaster_ was observed in this  investigation. All of the fluctuations noted were adequately explained  as resulting from the direct effects of weather or from its indirect  effect in determining the kinds and amounts of vegetation available as  food and shelter.    The differences in densities supported by the various "]]]
