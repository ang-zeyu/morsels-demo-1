With respect  to Jonson's use of his material, Dryden said memorably of him:  \"[He] was not only a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned  plagiary of all the others; you track him everywhere in their  snow....But he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he  fears not to be taxed by any law.  He invades authors like a  monarch, and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in  him.\"  And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided himself,  and justly, on his originality.  In \"Catiline,\" he not only uses  Sallust's account of the conspiracy, but he models some of the  speeches of Cicero on the Roman orator's actual words.  In  \"Poetaster,\" he lifts a whole satire out of Horace and dramatises  it effectively for his purposes.  The sophist Libanius suggests the  situation of \"The Silent Woman\"; a Latin comedy of Giordano Bruno,  \"Il Candelaio,\" the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in \"The  Alchemist,\" the \"Mostellaria\" of Plautus, its admirable opening  scene.  But Jonson commonly bettered his sources, and putting the  stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it  thenceforward to all time current and his own.    The lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a  peculiar merit.  His theory demanded design and the perfection of  literary finish. He was furthest from the rhapsodist and the  careless singer of an idle day; and he believed that Apollo could  only be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned.  And  yet many of Jonson's lyrics will live as long as the language.  Who  does not know \"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair.\"  \"Drink to me  only with thine eyes,\" or \"Still to be neat, still to be dressed\"?  Beautiful in form, deft and graceful in expression, with not a word  too much or one that bears not its part in the total effect, there  is yet about the lyrics of Jonson a certain stiffness and  formality, a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous and  unbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak, with  disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual  thought is on greater things.  It is for these reasons that Jonson  is even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where  rhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the  spontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical  poetry.  There are no such epitaphs as Ben Jonson's, witness the  charming ones on his own children, on Salathiel Pavy, the  child-actor, and many more; and this even though the rigid law of  mine and thine must now restore to William Browne of Tavistock the  famous lines beginning: \"Underneath this sable hearse.\"  Jonson is  unsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment, seldom  falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet  showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others,  a discriminating taste and a generous personal regard.  There was  no man in England of his rank so well known and universally beloved  as Ben Jonson.  The list of his friends, of those to whom he had  written verses, and those who had written verses to him, includes  the name of every man of prominence in the England of King James.  And the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate  familiarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth  of the laureate.  In 1619, growing unwieldy through inactivity,  Jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to Scotland.  On his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the  houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had  recommended him.  When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met  to grant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of  Scottish poets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest  at Hawthornden.  Some of the noblest of Jonson's poems were  inspired by friendship.  Such is the fine \"Ode to the memory of Sir  Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Moryson,\" and that admirable piece of  critical insight and filial affection, prefixed to the first  Shakespeare folio, \"To the memory of my beloved master, William  Shakespeare, and what he hath left us,\" to mention only these.  Nor  can the earlier \"Epode,\" beginning \"Not to know vice at all,\" be  matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and  stately age.    But if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his  folio and up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from  inactive; for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness  continued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court.  In \"The Golden Age Restored,\" Pallas turns the Iron Age with  its attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight; in  \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" Atlas figures represented as an  old man, his shoulders covered with snow, and Comus, \"the god of  cheer or the belly,\" is one of the characters, a circumstance which  an imaginative boy of ten, named John Milton, was not to forget.  \"Pan's Anniversary,\" late in the reign of James, proclaimed that  Jonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite lyrics, and  \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" displayed the old drollery and broad  humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable.  These, too, and  the earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo Room of  the Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of  English literary Bohemia.  We hear of a room blazoned about with  Jonson's own judicious \"Leges Convivales\" in letters of gold, of a  company made up of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly  attached to their veteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions,  affections, and enmities.  And we hear, too, of valorous potations;  but in the words of Herrick addressed to his master, Jonson, at the  Devil Tavern, as at the Dog, the Triple Tun, and at the Mermaid,         \"We such clusters had       As made us nobly wild, not mad,       And yet each verse of thine       Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\"    But the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,  though Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet  returned to the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, \"The  Staple of News,\" \"The New Inn,\" \"The Magnetic Lady,\" and \"The Tale  of a Tub,\" the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy.  None of these plays met with any marked success, although the  scathing generalisation of Dryden that designated them \"Jonson's  dotages\" is unfair to their genuine merits.  Thus the idea of an  office for the gathering, proper dressing, and promulgation of news  (wild flight of the fancy in its time) was an excellent subject for  satire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers; although  as much can hardly be said for \"The Magnetic Lady,\" who, in her  bounty, draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile  them in the end according to the alternative title, or \"Humours  Reconciled.\"  These last plays of the old dramatist revert to  caricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more  than ever present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon,  especially of his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears  unworthily to have used his influence at court against the  broken-down old poet.  And now disease claimed Jonson, and he was  bedridden for months.  He had succeeded Middleton in 1628 as  Chronologer to the City of London, but lost the post for not  fulfilling its duties.  King Charles befriended him, and even  commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;  and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and  devoted friends among the younger poets who were proud to be  \"sealed of the tribe of Ben.\"    Jonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which  he had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in  its various parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642.  It included all  the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, excepting \"The  Case is Altered;\" the masques, some fifteen, that date between 1617  and 1630; another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called  \"Underwoods\", including some further entertainments; a translation  of \"Horace's Art of Poetry\" (also published in a vicesimo quarto in  1640), and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would  hardly have included himself.  These last comprise the fragment  (less than seventy lines) of a tragedy called \"Mortimer his Fall,\"  and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty and poetic  spirit, \"The Sad Shepherd.\"  There is also the exceedingly  interesting \"English Grammar\" \"made by Ben Jonson for the benefit  of all strangers out of his observation of the English language now  spoken and in use,\" in Latin and English; and \"Timber, or  Discoveries\" \"made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of  his daily reading, or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of  the times.\"  The \"Discoveries,\" as it is usually called, is a  commonplace book such as many literary men have kept, in which  their reading was chronicled, passages that took their fancy  translated or transcribed, and their passing opinions noted.  Many  passages of Jonson's \"Discoveries\" are literal translations from the  authors he chanced to be reading, with the reference, noted or not,  as the accident of the moment prescribed.  At times he follows the  line of Macchiavelli's argument as to the nature and conduct of  princes; at others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and  poets by recourse to Aristotle.  He finds a choice paragraph on  eloquence in Seneca the elder and applies it to his own  recollection of Bacon's power as an orator;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4028"],[0,"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (#5)"],[1,"and Pope was Giulio, a natural son of Giuliano,  Lorenzo de Medicis brother, who had been killed in the Pazzi  conspiracy, year 1478. Giulio lived to become Pope Clement VII., to  suffer the sack of Rome in 1527, and to make the concordat with Charles  V. at Bologna in 1529-30, which settled for three centuries the destiny  of Italy. We shall hear much more of him from Cellini in the course of  this narrative.    X    ALL this while I worked as a goldsmith, and was able to assist my good  father. His other son, my brother Cecchino, had, as I said before, been  instructed in the rudiments of Latin letters. It was our fathers wish  to make me, the elder, a great musician and composer, and him, the  younger, a great and learned jurist. He could not, however, put force  upon the inclinations of our nature, which directed me to the arts of  design, and my brother, who had a fine and graceful person, to the  profession of arms. Cecchino, being still quite a lad, was returning  from his first lesson in the school of the stupendous Giovannino de  Medici. On the day when he reached home, I happened to be absent; and  he, being in want of proper clothes, sought out our sisters, who,  unknown to my father, gave him a cloak and doublet of mine, both new and  of good quality. I ought to say that, beside the aid I gave my father  and my excellent and honest sisters, I had bought those handsome clothes  out of my own savings. When I found I had been cheated, and my clothes  taken from me, and my brother from whom I should have recovered them was  gone, I asked my father why he suffered so great a wrong to be done me,  seeing that I was always ready to assist him. He replied that I was his  good son, but that the other, whom he thought to have lost, had been  found again; also that it was a duty, nay, a precept from God Himself,  that he who hath should give to him who hath not; and that for his sake  I ought to bear this injustice, for God would increase me in all good  things. I, like a youth without experience, retorted on my poor  afflicted parent; and taking the miserable remnants of my clothes and  money, went toward a gate of the city. As I did not know which gate  would start me on the road to Rome, I arrived at Lucca, and from Lucca  reached Pisa.    When I came to Pisa (I was about sixteen years of age at the time), I  stopped near the middle bridge, by what is called the Fish-stone, at the  shop of a goldsmith, and began attentively to watch what the master was  about. [1] He asked me who I was, and what was my profession. I told him  that I worked a little in the same trade as his own. This worthy man  bade me come into his shop, and at once gave me work to do, and spoke as  follows: Your good appearance makes me believe you are a decent honest  youth. Then he told me out gold, silver, and gems; and when the first  days work was finished, he took me in the evening to his house, where  he dwelt respectably with his handsome wife and children. Thinking of  the grief which my good father might be feeling for me, I wrote him that  I was sojourning with a very excellent and honest man, called Maestro  Ulivieri della Chiostra, and was working with him at many good things of  beauty and importance. I bade him be of good cheer, for that I was bent  on learning, and hoped by my acquirements to bring him back both profit  and honour before long. My good father answered the letter at once in  words like these: My son, the love I bear you is so great, that if it  were not for the honour of our family, which above all things I regard,  I should immediately have set off for you; for indeed it seems like  being without the light of my eyes, when I do not see you daily, as I  used to do. I will make it my business to complete the training of my  household up to virtuous honesty; do you make it yours to acquire  excellence in your art; and I only wish you to remember these four  simple words, obey them, and never let them escape your memory:         In whatever house you be,       Steal not, and live honestly.    Note 1. The Fish-stone, or Pietra del Pesce, was the market on the quay  where the fish brought from the sea up the Arno to Pisa used to be sold.    XI    THIS letter fell into the hands of my master Ulivieri, and he read it  unknown to me. Afterwards he avowed that he had read it, and added: So  then, my Benvenuto, your good looks did not deceive me, as a letter from  your father which has come into my hands gives me assurance, which  proves him to be a man of notable honesty and worth. Consider yourself  then to be at home here, and as though in your own fathers house.    While I stayed at Pisa, I went to see the Campo Santo, and there I found  many beautiful fragments of antiquity, that is to say, marble  sarcophagi. In other parts of Pisa also I saw many antique objects,  which I diligently studied whenever I had days or hours free from the  labour of the workshop. My master, who took pleasure in coming to visit  me in the little room which he had allotted me, observing that I spent  all my time in studious occupations, began to love me like a father. I  made great progress in the one year that I stayed there, and completed  several fine and valuable things in gold and silver, which inspired me  with a resolute ambition to advance in my art.    My father, in the meanwhile, kept writing piteous entreaties that I  should return to him; and in every letter bade me not to lose the music  he had taught me with such trouble. On this, I suddenly gave up all wish  to go back to him; so much did I hate that accursed music; and I felt as  though of a truth I were in paradise the whole year I stayed at Pisa,  where I never played the flute.    At the end of the year my master Ulivieri had occasion to go to  Florence, in order to sell certain gold and silver sweepings which he  had; [1] and inasmuch as the bad air of Pisa had given me a touch of  fever, I went with the fever hanging still about me, in my masters  company, back to Florence. There my father received him most  affectionately, and lovingly prayed him, unknown by me, not to insist on  taking me again to Pisa. I was ill about two months, during which time  my father had me most kindly treated and cured, always repeating that it  seemed to him a thousand years till I got well again, in order that he  might hear me play a little. But when he talked to me of music, with his  fingers on my pulse, seeing he had some acquaintance with medicine and  Latin learning, he felt it change so much if he approached that topic,  that he was often dismayed and left my side in tears. When I perceived  how greatly he was disappointed, I bade one of my sisters bring me a  flute; for though the fever never left me, that instrument is so easy  that it did not hurt me to play upon it; and I used it with such  dexterity of hand and tongue that my father coming suddenly upon me,  blessed me a thousand times, exclaiming that while I was away from him I  had made great progress, as he thought; and he begged me to go forwards,  and not to sacrifice so fine an accomplishment.    Note 1. I have translated 'spazzature' by 'sweepings.' It means all  refuse of the precious metals left in goldsmiths trays.    XII    WHEN I had recovered my health, I returned to my old friend Marcone, the  worthy goldsmith, who put me in the way of earning money, with which I  helped my father and our household. About that time there came to  Florence a sculptor named Piero Torrigiani; [1] he arrived from England,  where he had resided many years; and being intimate with my master, he  daily visited his house; and when he saw my drawings and the things  which I was making, he said: I have come to Florence to enlist as many  young men as I can; for I have undertaken to execute a great work of my  king, and want some of my own Florentines to help me. Now your method of  working and your designs are worthy rather of a sculptor than a  goldsmith; and since I have to turn out a great piece of bronze, I will  at the same time turn you into a rich and able artist. This man had a  splendid person and a most arrogant spirit, with the air of a great  soldier more than a sculptor, especially in regard to his vehement  gestures and his resonant voice, together with a habit he had of  knitting his brows, enough to frighten any man of courage. He kept  talking every day about his gallant feats among those beasts of  Englishmen.    In course of conversation he happened to mention Michel Agnolo  Buonarroti, led thereto by a drawing I had made from a cartoon of that  divinest painter. [2] This cartoon was the first masterpiece which  Michel Agnolo exhibited, in proof of his stupendous talents. He produced  it in competition with another painter, Lionardo da Vinci, who also made  a cartoon; and both were intended for the council-hall in the palace of  the Signory. They represented the taking of Pisa by the Florentines; and  our admirable Lionardo had chosen to depict a battle of horses, with the  capture of some standards, in as divine a style as could possibly be  imagined. Michel Agnolo in his cartoon portrayed a number of  foot-soldiers, who, the season being summer, had gone to bathe in Arno.  He drew them at the very moment the alarm is sounded, and the men all  naked run to arms; so splendid in their action that nothing survives of  ancient or of modern art which touches the same lofty point of  excellence; and as I have already said, the design of the great Lionardo  was itself most admirably beautiful. These two cartoons stood, one in  the palace of the Medici, the other in the hall of the Pope. So long as  they remained intact, they were the school of the world. Though the  divine Michel Agnolo in later life finished that great chapel of Pope  Julius, [3] he never rose half-way to the same pitch of power; his  genius never afterwards attained to the force of those first studies.
