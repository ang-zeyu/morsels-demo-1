Uncle Willis still  cultivates a small patch five miles out from the town.    \"Uncle Willis\" is a tall dark, brown-skinned man having a large head  covered with mixed gray wooly hair. He has lost very few teeth  considering his age. When sitting on the porches of the stores the soles  of his farm-shoes may be seen tied together with pieces of wire. He  supports himself with a cane made from the Elm tree. At present he wears  a tall white Texas Centennial hat which makes him appear more unique  than ever.    \"Uncle Willis'\" memory is vivid. He is familiar with the older figures  in the history of the County. He tells tales of having travelled by oxen  to West Texas for flour and being gone for six months at a time. He  remembers the Keechi and the Kickapoo Indians and also claims that he  can point out a tree where the Americans hung an Indian Chief. He says  that he has plowed up arrows, pots and flints on the Reubens Bains place  and on the McDaniel farms. He can tell of the early lawlessness in the  County. His face lights up when he recalls how the Yankee soldiers came  through Centerville telling the slave owners to free their slaves. He  also talks very low when he mentions the name of Jeff Davis because he  says, \"Wha' man eavesdrops the niggers houses in slavery time and if  yer' sed' that Jeff Davis was a good man, they barbecued a hog for you,  but if yer' sed' that Abe Lincoln was a good man, yer' had to fight or  go to the woods.\"    Among the most interesting tales told by \"Uncle Willis\" is the tale of  the \"Lead mine.\" \"Uncle Willis\" says that some where along Boggy Creek  near a large hickory tree and a red oak tree, near Patrick's Lake, he  and his master, Auss McDaniels, would dig lead out of the ground which  they used to make pistol and rifle balls for the old Mississippi rifles  during slavery time. Uncle Willis claims that they would dig slags of  lead out of the ground some 12 and 15 inches long, and others as large  as a man's fist. They would carry this ore back to the big house and  melt it down to get the trash out of it, then they would pour it into  molds and make rifle balls and pistol balls from it. In this way they  kept plenty of amunition on hand. In recent years the land has changed  ownership, and the present owners live in Dallas. Learning of the tale  of the \"lead mine\" on their property they went to Centerville in an  attempt to locate it and were referred to \"Uncle Willis.\" Uncle Willis  says they offered him two hundred dollars if he could locate the mine.  Being so sure that he knew its exact location, said that the $200 was  his meat. However, Uncle Willis was unable to locate the spot where they  dug the lead and the mine remains a mystery.[C]    Recently a group of citizens of Leon County including W.D. Lacey, Joe  McDaniel, Debbs Brown, W.H. Hill and Judge Lacey cross questioned Uncle  Willis about the lead mine. Judge Lacey did the questioning while them  others formed an audience. The conversation went as follows:    \"Which way would you go when you went to the mine?\" Judge Lacey asked.    \"Out tow'hd Normangee.\"    \"How long would it take you to get there?\"    \"Two or three hours.\"    \"Was it on a creek?\"    \"Yessuh.\"    \"But you cant go to it now?\"    \"Nosuh, I just can't recollect exactly where 'tis.[B]    J. Frank Dobie mentions many tales of lost lead mines throughout Texas  in Coronado's Children, a publication of the Texas Folk-Lore Society.  Lead in the early days of the Republic and the State was very valuable,  as it was the source of protection from the Indians and also the means  of supplying food.[A]          420056      [Illustration: Mary Armstrong]           MARY ARMSTRONG, 91, lives at 3326 Pierce Ave., Houston, Texas. She       was born on a farm near St. Louis, Missouri, a slave of William       Cleveland. Her father, Sam Adams, belonged to a \"nigger trader,\"       who had a farm adjoining the Cleveland place.      \"I's Aunt Mary, all right, but you all has to 'scuse me if I don't talk  so good, 'cause I's been feelin' poorly for a spell and I ain't so young  no more. Law me, when I think back what I used to do, and now it's all I  can do to hobble 'round a little. Why, Miss Olivia, my mistress, used to  put a glass plumb full of water on my head and then have me waltz 'round  the room, and I'd dance so smoothlike, I don't spill nary drap.    \"That was in St. Louis, where I's born. You see, my mamma belong to old  William Cleveland and old Polly Cleveland, and they was the meanest two  white folks what ever lived, 'cause they was allus beatin' on their  slaves. I know, 'cause mamma told me, and I hears about it other places,  and besides, old Polly, she was a Polly devil if there ever was one, and  she whipped my little sister what was only nine months old and jes' a  baby to death. She come and took the diaper offen my little sister and  whipped till the blood jes' ran--jes' 'cause she cry like all babies do,  and it kilt my sister. I never forgot that, but I sot some even with  that old Polly devil and it's this-a-way.    \"You see, I's 'bout 10 year old and I belongs to Miss Olivia, what was  that old Polly's daughter, and one day old Polly devil comes to where  Miss Olivia lives after she marries, and trys to give me a lick out in  the yard, and I picks up a rock 'bout as big as half your fist and hits  her right in the eye and busted the eyeball, and tells her that's for  whippin' my baby sister to death. You could hear her holler for five  miles, but Miss Olivia, when I tells her, says, 'Well, I guess mamma has  larnt her lesson at last.' But that old Polly was mean like her husban',  old Cleveland, till she die, and I hopes they is burnin' in torment now.    \"I don't 'member 'bout the start of things so much, 'cept what Miss  Olivia and my mamma, her name was Siby, tells me. Course, it's powerful  cold in winter times and the farms was lots different from down here.  They calls 'em plantations down here but up at St. Louis they was jes'  called farms, and that's what they was, 'cause we raises wheat and  barley and rye and oats and corn and fruit.    \"The houses was builded with brick and heavy wood, too, 'cause it's cold  up there, and we has to wear the warm clothes and they's wove on the  place, and we works at it in the evenin's.    \"Old Cleveland takes a lot of his slaves what was in 'custom' and brings  'em to Texas to sell. You know, he wasn't sposed to do that, 'cause when  you's in 'custom', that's 'cause he borrowed money on you, and you's not  sposed to leave the place till he paid up. Course, old Cleveland jes'  tells the one he owed the money to, you had run off, or squirmed out  some way, he was that mean.    \"Mamma say she was in one bunch and me in 'nother. Mamma had been put  'fore this with my papa, Sam Adams, but that makes no diff'rence to Old  Cleveland. He's so mean he never would sell the man and woman and  chillen to the same one. He'd sell the man here and the woman there and  if they's chillen, he'd sell them some place else. Oh, old Satan in  torment couldn't be no meaner than what he and Old Polly was to they  slaves. He'd chain a nigger up to whip 'em and rub salt and pepper on  him, like he said, 'to season him up.' And when he'd sell a slave, he'd  grease their mouth all up to make it look like they'd been fed good and  was strong and healthy.    \"Well mamma say they hadn't no more'n got to Shreveport 'fore some law  man cotch old Cleveland and takes 'em all back to St. Louis. Then my  little sister's born, the one old Polly devil kilt, and I's 'bout four  year old then.    \"Miss Olivia takes a likin' to me and, though her papa and mama so mean,  she's kind to everyone, and they jes' love her. She marries to Mr. Will  Adams what was a fine man, and has 'bout five farms and 500 slaves, and  he buys me for her from old Cleveland and pays him $2,500.00, and gives  him George Henry, a nigger, to boot. Lawsy, I's sho' happy to be with  Miss Olivia and away from old Cleveland and Old Polly, 'cause they kilt  my little sister.    \"We lives in St. Louis, on Chinquapin Hill, and I's housegirl, and when  the babies starts to come I nusses 'em and spins thread for clothes on  the loom. I spins six cuts of thread a week, but I has plenty of time  for myself and that's where I larns to dance so good. Law, I sho' jes'  crazy 'bout dancin'. If I's settin' eatin' my victuals and hears a  fiddle play, I gets up and dances.    \"Mr. Will and Miss Olivia sho' is good to me, and I never calls Mr. Will  'massa' neither, but when they's company I calls him Mr. Will and 'round  the house by ourselves I calls them 'pappy' and 'mammy', 'cause they  raises me up from the little girl. I hears old Cleveland done took my  mamma to Texas 'gain but I couldn't do nothin', 'cause Miss Olivia  wouldn't have much truck with her folks. Once in a while old Polly comes  over, but Miss Olivia tells her not to touch me or the others. Old Polly  trys to buy me back from Miss Olivia, and if they had they'd kilt me  sho'. But Miss Olivia say, 'I'd wade in blood as deep as Hell 'fore I'd  let you have Mary.' That's jes' the very words she told 'em.    \"Then I hears my papa is sold some place I don't know where. 'Course, I  didn't know him so well, jes' what mamma done told me, so that didn't  worry me like mamma being took so far away.    \"One day Mr. Will say, 'Mary, you want to go to the river and see the  boat race?' Law me, I never won't forget that. Where we live it ain't  far to the Miss'sippi River and pretty soon here they comes, the Natchez  and the Eclipse, with smoke and fire jes' pourin' out of they  smokestacks. That old captain on the 'Clipse starts puttin' in bacon  meat in the boiler and the grease jes' comes out a-blazin' and it beat  the Natchez to pieces.    \"I stays with Miss Olivia till '63 when Mr. Will set us all free. I was  'bout 17 year old then or more. I say I goin' find my mamma.

This bird inhabits the vast plains of the interior of New South Wales.  It is one of the handsomest, not only of the Australian Parrots, but  takes foremost place among the most gorgeously dressed members of the  Parrot family that are to be met with in any part of the world. It  is about eleven or twelve inches in length. The female cannot with  certainty be distinguished from her mate, but is usually a very little  smaller. The Lory seldom descends to the ground, but passes the greater  part of its life among the gum trees upon the pollen and nectar on which  it mainly subsists. In times of scarcity, however, it will also eat  grass seeds, as well as insects, for want of which it is said, it often  dies prematurely when in captivity.    Dr. Russ mentions that a pair obtained from a London dealer in 1870 for  fifty dollars were the first of these birds imported, but the London  Zoological Society had secured some of them two years before.    Despite his beauty, the Blue Mountain Lory is not a desirable bird to  keep, as he requires great care. A female which survived six years in an  aviary, laying several eggs, though kept singly, was fed on canary seed,  maize, a little sugar, raw beef and carrots. W. Gedney seems to have  been peculiarly happy in his specimens, remarking, \"But for the terribly  sudden death which so often overtakes these birds, they would be the  most charming feathered pets that a lady could possess, having neither  the power nor inclination to bite savagely.\" The same writer's  recommendation to feed this Lory exclusively upon soft food, in which  honey forms a great part, probably accounts for his advice to those  \"whose susceptible natures would be shocked\" by the sudden death of  their favorite, not to become the owner of a Blue Mountain Lory.    Like all the parrot family these Lories breed in hollow boughs, where  the female deposits from three to four white eggs, upon which she sits  for twenty-one days. The young from the first resemble their parents  closely, but are a trifle less brilliantly colored.    They are very active and graceful, but have an abominable shriek. The  noise is said to be nearly as disagreeable as the plumage is beautiful.  They are very quarrelsome and have to be kept apart from the other  parrots, which they will kill. Other species of birds however, are not  disturbed by them. It is a sort of family animosity. They have been bred  in captivity.    The feathers of the head and neck are long and very narrow and lie  closely together; the claws are strong and hooked, indicating their tree  climbing habits. Their incessant activity and amusing ways make these  birds always interesting to watch.          THE RED WING BLACK BIRD.    The Bird of Society.        The blackbirds make the maples ring      With social cheer and jubilee;      The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee.--EMERSON.      The much abused and persecuted Red Wing Black Bird is found throughout  North America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific; and it breeds more  or less abundantly wherever found. In New England it is generally  migratory, though instances are on record where a few have been known  to remain throughout the winter in Massachusetts. Passing, in January,  through the lower counties of Virginia, one frequently witnesses the  aerial evolutions of great numbers of these birds. Sometimes they appear  as if driven about like an enormous black cloud carried before the wind,  varying every moment in shape. Sometimes they rise suddenly from the  fields with a noise like thunder, while the glittering of innumerable  wings of the brightest vermillion, amid the black cloud, occasion a very  striking effect. At times the whole congregated multitude will suddenly  alight in some detached grove and commence one general concert, that can  plainly be distinguished at the distance of more than two miles. With  the Redwings the whole winter season seems one continued carnival. They  find abundant food in the old fields of rice, buckwheat and grain, and  much of their time is spent in aerial movements, or in grand vocal  performances.    The Redwings, for their nest, always select either the borders of  streams or low marshy situations, amongst thick bunches of reeds. One  nest was found built on a slender sapling at the distance of fourteen  feet from the ground. The nest was pensile, like that of the Baltimore  Oriole.    They have from one to three or more broods in a season, according to  locality.    In the grain growing states they gather in immense swarms and commit  havoc, and although they are shot in great numbers, and though their  ranks are thinned by the attacks of hawks, it seems to have but little  effect upon the survivors.    On the other hand, these Black Birds more than compensate the farmer  for their mischief by the benefit they confer in the destruction of grub  worms, caterpillars, and various kinds of larvae, the secret and deadly  enemies of vegetation. It has been estimated the number of insects  destroyed by these birds in a single season, in the United States, to  be twelve thousand millions.    The eggs average about an inch in length. They are oval in shape, have a  light bluish ground, and are marbled, lined and blotched with markings  of light and dark purple and black.      BLACKBIRD.        'Tis a woodland enchanted!      By no sadder spirit      Than blackbirds and thrushes,      That whistle to cheer it      All day in the bushes,      This woodland is haunted;      And in a small clearing,      Beyond sight or hearing      Of human annoyance,      The little fount gushes.--LOWELL.    [Illustration: RED-WING BLACK BIRD.]          THE BIRD OF SOCIETY.      The blackbird loves to be one of a great flock. He talks, sings or  scolds from morning until night. He cannot keep still. He will only stay  alone with his family a few months in the summer. That is the reason he  is called the \"Bird of Society.\" When he is merry, he gaily sings,  \"Conk-quer-ree.\" When he is angry or frightened he screams, \"Chock!  Chock!\" When he is flying or bathing he gives a sweet note which sounds  like ee-u-u. He can chirp--chick, check, chuck, to his little ones as  softly as any other bird. But only his best friends ever hear his  sweetest tones, for the Blackbirds do not know how to be polite. They  all talk at once. That is why most people think they only scream and  chatter. Did you ever hear the blackbirds in the cornfields? If the  farmers thought about it perhaps they would feel that part of every corn  crop belongs to the Blackbirds. When the corn is young, the farmer  cannot see the grubs which are eating the young plants. The Blackbirds  can. They feed them to their babies--many thousands in a day. That is  the way the crops are saved for the farmer. But he never thinks of that.  Later when the Blackbirds come for their share of the corn the farmer  says, \"No, they shall not have my corn. I must stop that quickly.\"  Perhaps the Blackbirds said the same thing to the grubs in the spring.  It is hard to have justice for everyone.    In April the Blackbird and his mate leave the noisy company. They seek  a cosy home near the water where they can be quiet until August. They  usually choose a swampy place among low shrubs and rushes. Here in the  deep nest of coarse grass, moss and mud the mother bird lays her five  eggs. They are very pretty--light blue with purple and black markings.  Their friends say this is the best time to watch the blackbirds. In the  flock they are all so much alike we cannot tell one from another. You  would like to hear of some of the wise things Blackbirds do when they  are tame.    One friend of the birds turned her home into a great open bird cage. Her  chair was the favorite perch of her birds. She never kept them one  minute longer than they wanted to stay. Yet her home was always full.  This was Olive Thorne Miller.
