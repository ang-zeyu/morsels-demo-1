Obstinate drunks who had done nothing but lie  on the ground and kick their feet in the air, would get up like birds,  serpent-charmed, to go with him to durance vile.    As soon as he saw the canvasser, and noted his fixed, unearthly stare,  and listened to his hoarse, unnatural voice, the sergeant knew what was  the matter; it was a man in the horrors, a common enough spectacle at  Ninemile. He resolved to decoy him into the lock-up, and accosted him in  a friendly, free-and-easy way.    \"Good day t'ye,\" he said.    \"---- most magnificent volume ever published, jewelled in fourteen  holes, working on a ruby roller, and in a glass case,\" said the  book-canvasser. \"The likenesses of the historical personages are  so natural that the book must not be left open on the table, or the  mosquitoes will ruin it by stinging the portraits.\"    It then dawned on the sergeant that this was no mere case of the  horrors--he was dealing with a book-canvasser.    \"Ah, sure,\" he said, \"fwhat's the use uv tryin' to sell books at all, at  all; folks does be peltin' them out into the street, and the nanny-goats  lives on them these times. Oi send the childer out to pick 'em up, and  we have 'em at me place in barrow-loads. Come along wid me now, and  Oi'll make you nice and comfortable for the night,\" and he laid his hand  on the outstretched palm of the figure.    It was a fatal mistake. He had set in motion the machinery which  operated the figure's left arm, and it moved that limb in towards its  body, and hugged the sergeant to its breast, with a vice-like grip. Then  it started in a faltering and uneven, but dogged, way to walk towards  the river.    \"Immortial Saints!\" gasped the sergeant, \"he's squazin' the livin'  breath out uv me. Lave go now loike a dacent sowl, lave go. And oh,  for the love uv God, don't be shpakin' into me ear that way;\" for the  figure's mouth was pressed tight against the sergeant's ear, and its  awful voice went through and through the little man's head, as it held  forth about the volume. The sergeant struggled violently, and by so  doing set some more springs in motion, and the figure's right arm  made terrific swipes in the air. A following of boys and loafers had  collected by this time. \"Blimey, how does he lash out!\" was the remark  they made. But they didn't interfere, notwithstanding the sergeant's  frantic appeals, and things were going hard with him when his  subordinate, Constable Dooley, appeared on the scene.    Dooley, better known as The Wombat because of his sleepy disposition,  was a man of great strength. He had originally been quartered at Sydney,  and had fought many bitter battles with the notorious \"pushes\" of Bondi,  Surry Hills and The Rocks. After that, duty at Ninemile was child's  play, and he never ran in fewer than two drunks at a time; it was  beneath his dignity to be seen capturing a solitary inebriate. If they  wouldn't come any other way, he would take them by the ankles and drag  them after him. When the Wombat saw the sergeant in the grasp of an  inebriate he bore down on the fray full of fight.    \"I'll soon make him lave go, sergeant,\" he said, and he caught hold of  the figure's right arm, to put on the \"police twist\". Unfortunately,  at that exact moment the sergeant touched one of the springs in the  creature's breast. With the suddenness and severity of a horse-kick, it  lashed out with its right hand, catching the redoubtable Dooley a thud  on the jaw, and sending him to grass as if he had been shot.    For a few minutes he \"lay as only dead men lie\". Then he got up bit by  bit, wandered off home to the police-barracks, and mentioned casually  to his wife that John L. Sullivan had come to town, and had taken  the sergeant away to drown him. After which, having given orders that  anybody who called was to be told that he had gone fifteen miles out of  town to serve a summons on a man for not registering a dog, he locked  himself up in a cell for the rest of the day.    Meanwhile, the Cast-iron Canvasser, still holding the sergeant tightly  clutched to its breast, was marching straight towards the river.  Something had disorganised its vocal arrangements, and it was now  positively shrieking in the sergeant's ear, and, as it yelled, the  little man yelled still louder.    \"Oi don't want yer accursed book. Lave go uv me, Oi say!\" He beat with  his fists on its face, and kicked its shins without avail. A short,  staggering rush, a wild shriek from the officer, and they both toppled  over the steep bank and went souse into the depths of Ninemile Creek.    That was the end of the matter. The Genius and his mate returned to town  hurriedly, and lay low, expecting to be indicted for murder. Constable  Dooley drew up a report for the Chief of Police which contained so many  strange statements that the Police department concluded the sergeant  must have got drunk and drowned himself, and that Dooley saw him do it,  but was too drunk to pull him out.    Anyone unacquainted with Ninemile might expect that a report of the  occurrence would have reached the Sydney papers. As a matter of fact the  storekeeper did think of writing one, but decided that it was too much  trouble. There was some idea of asking the Government to fish the two  bodies out of the river; but about that time an agitation was started  in Ninemile to have the Federal Capital located there, and nothing else  mattered.    The Genius discovered a pub in Sydney that kept the Ninemile brand of  whisky, and drank himself to death; the Wombat became a Sub-Inspector of  Police; Sloper entered the Christian ministry; Dodge was elected to the  Federal Parliament; and a vague tradition about \"a bloke who came up  here in the horrors, and drownded poor old O'Grady,\" is the only memory  that remains of that wonderful creation, the Cast-iron Canvasser.          THE MERINO SHEEP      People have got the impression that the merino is a gentle, bleating  animal that gets its living without trouble to anybody, and comes up  every year to be shorn with a pleased smile upon its amiable face. It is  my purpose here to exhibit the merino sheep in its true light.    First let us give him his due. No one can accuse him of being a  ferocious animal. No one could ever say that a sheep attacked him  without provocation; although there is an old bush story of a man who  was discovered in the act of killing a neighbour's wether.    \"Hello!\" said the neighbour, \"What's this? Killing my sheep! What have  you got to say for yourself?\"    \"Yes,\" said the man, with an air of virtuous indignation. \"I _am_ killing  your sheep. I'll kill _any_ man's sheep that bites _me_!\"    But as a rule the merino refrains from using his teeth on people. He  goes to work in another way.    The truth is that he is a dangerous monomaniac, and his one idea is to  ruin the man who owns him. With this object in view he will display a  talent for getting into trouble and a genius for dying that are almost  incredible.    If a mob of sheep see a bush fire closing round them, do they run away  out of danger? Not at all, they rush round and round in a ring till the  fire burns them up. If they are in a river-bed, with a howling flood  coming down, they will stubbornly refuse to cross three inches of water  to save themselves. Dogs may bark and men may shriek, but the sheep  won't move. They will wait there till the flood comes and drowns them  all, and then their corpses go down the river on their backs with their  feet in the air.    A mob will crawl along a road slowly enough to exasperate a snail, but  let a lamb get away in a bit of rough country, and a racehorse can't  head him back again. If sheep are put into a big paddock with water in  three corners of it, they will resolutely crowd into the fourth, and die  of thirst.    When being counted out at a gate, if a scrap of bark be left on the  ground in the gateway, they will refuse to step over it until dogs and  men have sweated and toiled and sworn and \"heeled 'em up\", and \"spoke  to 'em\", and fairly jammed them at it. At last one will gather courage,  rush at the fancied obstacle, spring over it about six feet in the air,  and dart away. The next does exactly the same, but jumps a bit higher.  Then comes a rush of them following one another in wild bounds like  antelopes, until one overjumps himself and alights on his head. This  frightens those still in the yard, and they stop running out.    Then the dogging and shrieking and hustling and tearing have to be gone  through all over again. (This on a red-hot day, mind you, with clouds  of blinding dust about, the yolk of wool irritating your eyes, and,  perhaps, three or four thousand sheep to put through). The delay throws  out the man who is counting, and he forgets whether he left off at 45  or 95. The dogs, meanwhile, have taken the first chance to slip over  the fence and hide in the shade somewhere, and then there are loud  whistlings and oaths, and calls for Rover and Bluey. At last a  dirt-begrimed man jumps over the fence, unearths Bluey, and hauls him  back by the ear. Bluey sets to work barking and heeling-'em up again,  and pretends that he thoroughly enjoys it; but all the while he is  looking out for another chance to \"clear\". And _this_ time he won't be  discovered in a hurry.    There is a well-authenticated story of a ship-load of sheep that was  lost because an old ram jumped overboard, and all the rest followed him.  No doubt they did, and were proud to do it. A sheep won't go through  an open gate on his own responsibility, but he would gladly and proudly  \"follow the leader\" through the red-hot portals of Hades: and it makes  no difference whether the lead goes voluntarily, or is hauled struggling  and kicking and fighting every inch of the way.    For pure, sodden stupidity there is no animal like the merino. A lamb  will follow a bullock-dray, drawn by sixteen bullocks and driven by  a profane person "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#5)"],[1,"by the dagger, or enmity conducted to its ends under  the mask of law, could not but be anticipated where the fierce Italian  spirit was subjected to so severe a restraint: it is much that jealousy  appears usually unmingled with illegitimate ambition, and that, for  every instance in which private passion sought its gratification  through public danger, there are a thousand in which it was sacrificed  to the public advantage. Venice may well call upon us to note with  reverence, that of all the towers which are still seen rising like a  branchless forest from her islands, there is but one whose office was  other than that of summoning to prayer, and that one was a watch-tower  only: from first to last, while the palaces of the other cities of  Italy were lifted into sullen fortitudes of rampart, and fringed with  forked battlements for the javelin and the bow, the sands of Venice  never sank under the weight of a war tower, and her roof terraces were  wreathed with Arabian imagery, of golden globes suspended on the leaves  of lilies.[15]    Sec. XIII. These, then, appear to me to be the points of chief general  interest in the character and fate of the Venetian people. I would next  endeavor to give the reader some idea of the manner in which the  testimony of Art bears upon these questions, and of the aspect which the  arts themselves assume when they are regarded in their true connexion  with the history of the state.    1st. Receive the witness of Painting.    It will be remembered that I put the commencement of the Fall of Venice  as far back as 1418.    Now, John Bellini was born in 1423, and Titian in 1480. John Bellini,  and his brother Gentile, two years older than he, close the line of the  sacred painters of Venice. But the most solemn spirit of religious faith  animates their works to the last. There is no religion in any work of  Titian's: there is not even the smallest evidence of religious temper or  sympathies either in himself, or in those for whom he painted. His  larger sacred subjects are merely themes for the exhibition of pictorial  rhetoric,--composition and color. His minor works are generally made  subordinate to purposes of portraiture. The Madonna in the church of the  Frari is a mere lay figure, introduced to form a link of connexion  between the portraits of various members of the Pesaro family who  surround her.    Now this is not merely because John Bellini was a religious man and  Titian was not. Titian and Bellini are each true representatives of the  school of painters contemporary with them; and the difference in their  artistic feeling is a consequence not so much of difference in their own  natural characters as in their early education: Bellini was brought up  in faith; Titian in formalism. Between the years of their births the  vital religion of Venice had expired.    Sec. XIV. The _vital_ religion, observe, not the formal. Outward  observance was as strict as ever; and doge and senator still were painted,  in almost every important instance, kneeling before the Madonna or St.  Mark; a confession of faith made universal by the pure gold of the  Venetian sequin. But observe the great picture of Titian's in the ducal  palace, of the Doge Antonio Grimani kneeling before Faith: there is a  curious lesson in it. The figure of Faith is a coarse portrait of one of  Titian's least graceful female models: Faith had become carnal. The eye  is first caught by the flash of the Doge's armor. The heart of Venice  was in her wars, not in her worship.    The mind of Tintoret, incomparably more deep and serious than that of  Titian, casts the solemnity of its own tone over the sacred subjects  which it approaches, and sometimes forgets itself into devotion; but the  principle of treatment is altogether the same as Titian's: absolute  subordination of the religious subject to purposes of decoration or  portraiture.    The evidence might be accumulated a thousandfold from the works of  Veronese, and of every succeeding painter,--that the fifteenth century  had taken away the religious heart of Venice.    Sec. XV. Such is the evidence of Painting. To collect that of  Architecture will be our task through many a page to come; but I must  here give a general idea of its heads.    Philippe de Commynes, writing of his entry into Venice in 1495, says,--    \"Chascun me feit seoir au meillieu de ces deux ambassadeurs qui est  l'honneur d'Italie que d'estre au meillieu; et me menerent au long de la  grant rue, qu'ilz appellent le Canal Grant, et est bien large. Les  gallees y passent a travers et y ay ven navire de quatre cens tonneaux  ou plus pres des maisons: et est la plus belle rue que je croy qui soit  en tout le monde, et la mieulx maisonnee, et va le long de la ville. Les  maisons sont fort grandes et haultes, et de bonne pierre, et les  anciennes toutes painctes; les aultres faictes depuis cent ans: toutes  ont le devant de marbre blanc, qui leur vient d'Istrie, a cent mils de  la, et encores maincte grant piece de porphire et de sarpentine sur le  devant.... C'est la plus triumphante cite que j'aye jamais vene et qui  plus faict d'honneur a ambassadeurs et estrangiers, et qui plus  saigement se gouverne, et ou le service de Dieu est le plus  sollempnellement faict: et encores qu'il y peust bien avoir d'aultres  faultes, si je croy que Dieu les a en ayde pour la reverence qu'ilz  portent au service de l'Eglise.\"[16]    [Illustration: Plate I. Wall-Veil-Decoration.                          CA'TREVISAN                          CA'DARIO.]    Sec. XVI. This passage is of peculiar interest, for two reasons. Observe,  first, the impression of Commynes respecting the religion of Venice: of  which, as I have above said, the forms still remained with some  glimmering of life in them, and were the evidence of what the real life  had been in former times. But observe, secondly, the impression  instantly made on Commynes' mind by the distinction between the elder  palaces and those built \"within this last hundred years; which all have  their fronts of white marble brought from Istria, a hundred miles away,  and besides, many a large piece of porphyry and serpentine upon their  fronts.\"    On the opposite page I have given two of the ornaments of the palaces  which so struck the French ambassador.[17] He was right in his notice of  the distinction. There had indeed come a change over Venetian  architecture in the fifteenth century; and a change of some importance  to us moderns: we English owe to it our St. Paul's Cathedral, and Europe  in general owes to it the utter degradation or destruction of her  schools of architecture, never since revived. But that the reader may  understand this, it is necessary that he should have some general idea  of the connexion of the architecture of Venice with that of the rest of  Europe, from its origin forwards.    Sec. XVII. All European architecture, bad and good, old and new, is  derived from Greece through Rome, and colored and perfected from the East.  The history of architecture is nothing but the tracing of the various  modes and directions of this derivation. Understand this, once for all:  if you hold fast this great connecting clue, you may string all the types  of successive architectural invention upon it like so many beads. The  Doric and the Corinthian orders are the roots, the one of all Romanesque,  massy-capitaled buildings--Norman, Lombard, Byzantine, and what else you  can name of the kind; and the Corinthian of all Gothic, Early English,  French, German, and Tuscan. Now observe: those old Greeks gave the  shaft; Rome gave the arch; the Arabs pointed and foliated the arch. The  shaft and arch, the frame-work and strength of architecture, are from  the race of Japheth: the spirituality and sanctity of it from Ismael,  Abraham, and Shem.    Sec. XVIII. There is high probability that the Greek received his shaft  system from Egypt; but I do not care to keep this earlier derivation in  the mind of the reader. It is only necessary that he should be able to  refer to a fixed point of origin, when the form of the shaft was first  perfected. But it may be incidentally observed, that if the Greeks did  indeed receive their Doric from Egypt, then the three families of the  earth have each contributed their part to its noblest architecture: and  Ham, the servant of the others, furnishes the sustaining or bearing  member, the shaft; Japheth the arch; Shem the spiritualisation of both.    Sec. XIX. I have said that the two orders, Doric and Corinthian, are the  roots of all European architecture. You have, perhaps, heard of five  orders; but there are only two real orders, and there never can be any  more until doomsday. On one of these orders the ornament is convex:  those are Doric, Norman, and what else you recollect of the kind. On the  other the ornament is concave: those are Corinthian, Early English,  Decorated, and what else you recollect of that kind. The transitional  form, in which the ornamental line is straight, is the centre or root of  both. All other orders are varieties of those, or phantasms and  grotesques altogether indefinite in number and species.[18]    Sec. XX. This Greek architecture, then, with its two orders, was clumsily  copied and varied by the Romans with no particular result, until they  begun to bring the arch into extensive practical service; except only  that the Doric capital was spoiled in endeavors to mend it, and the  Corinthian much varied and enriched with fanciful, and often very  beautiful imagery. And in this state of things came Christianity: seized  upon the arch as her own; decorated it, and delighted in it; invented a  new Doric capital to replace the spoiled Roman one: and all over the  Roman empire set to work, with such materials as were nearest at hand,  to express and adorn herself as best she could. This Roman Christian  architecture is the exact expression of the Christianity of the time,  very fervid"]]]
