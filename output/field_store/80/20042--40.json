Without an instant's delay, Macdonald had him by the  throat, and gripping him fiercely, began to slowly bend him backward  over his knee. Then for the first time Macdonald spoke:    \"LeNoir,\" he said, solemnly, \"the days of your boasting are over. You  will no longer glory in your strength, for now I will break your back to  you.\"    LeNoir tried to speak, but his voice came in horrible gurgles. His face  was a ghastly greenish hue, lined with purple and swollen veins, his  eyes were standing out of his head, and his breath sobbing in raucous  gasps. Slowly the head went back. The crowd stood in horror-stricken  silence waiting for the sickening snap. Yankee, unable to stand it any  longer, stepped up to his chief, and in a most matter of fact voice  drawled out, \"About an inch more that way I guess 'll do the trick, if  he ain't double-jointed.\"    \"Aye,\" said Macdonald, holding grimly on.    \"Tonald,\"--Black Hugh's voice sounded faint but clear in the awful  silence--\"Tonald--you will not--be killing--him. Remember that now. I  will--never--forgive you--if you will--take that--from my hands.\"    The cry for vengeance smote Macdonald to the heart, and recalled him to  himself. He paused, threw back his locks from his eyes, then relaxing  his grip, stood up.    \"God preserve me!\" he groaned, \"what am I about?\"    For some time he remained standing silent, with head down as if not  quite sure of himself. He was recalled by a grip of his arm. He turned  and saw his nephew, Ranald, at his side. The boy's dark face was pale  with passion.    \"And is that all you are going to do to him?\" he demanded. Macdonald  gazed at him.    \"Do you not see what he has done?\" he continued, pointing to his father,  who was still lying propped up on some coats. \"Why did you not break his  back? You said you would! The brute, beast!\"    He hurled out the words in hot hate. His voice pierced the noise of the  room. Macdonald stood still, gazing at the fierce, dark face in solemn  silence. Then he sadly shook his head.    \"My lad, 'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.' It would have pleased me  well, but the hand of the Lord was laid upon me and I could not kill  him.\"    \"Then it is myself will kill him,\" he shrieked, springing like a wildcat  at LeNoir. But his uncle wound his arms around him and held him fast.  For a minute and more he struggled fiercely, crying to be set free,  till recognizing the uselessness of his efforts he grew calm, and said  quietly, \"Let me loose, uncle; I will be quiet.\" And his uncle set him  free. The boy shook himself, and then standing up before LeNoir said, in  a high, clear voice:    \"Will you hear me, LeNoir? The day will come when I will do to you what  you have done to my father, and if my father will die, then by the life  of God [a common oath among the shanty-men] I will have your life for  it.\" His voice had an unearthly shrillness in it, and LeNoir shrank  back.    \"Whist, whist, lad! be quate!\" said his uncle; \"these are not goot  words.\" The lad heeded him not, but sank down beside his father on the  floor. Black Hugh raised himself on his elbow with a grim smile on his  face.    \"It is a goot lad whatever, but please God he will not need to keep his  word.\" He laid his hand in a momentary caress upon his boy's shoulder,  and sank back again, saying, \"Take me out of this.\"    Then Macdonald Bhain turned to Dan Murphy and gravely addressed him:    \"Dan Murphy, it is an ungodly and cowardly work you have done this day,  and the curse of God will be on you if you will not repent.\" Then he  turned away, and with Big Mack's help bore his brother to the pointer,  followed by his men, bloody, bruised, but unconquered. But before he  left the room LeNoir stepped forward, and offering his hand, said, \"You  mak friends wit' me. You de boss bully on de reever Hottawa.\"    Macdonald neither answered nor looked his way, but passed out in grave  silence.    Then Yankee Jim remarked to Dan Murphy, \"I guess you'd better git them  logs out purty mighty quick. We'll want the river in about two days.\"  Dan Murphy said not a word, but when the Glengarry men wanted the river  they found it open.    But for Macdonald the fight was not yet over, for as he sat beside his  brother, listening to his groans, his men could see him wreathing his  hands and chanting in an undertone the words, \"Vengeance is mine saith  the Lord.\" And as he sat by the camp-fire that night listening to  Yankee's account of the beginning of the trouble, and heard how his  brother had kept himself in hand, and how at last he had been foully  smitten, Macdonald's conflict deepened, and he rose up and cried aloud:    \"God help me! Is this to go unpunished? I will seek him to-morrow.\" And  he passed out into the dark woods.    After a few moments the boy Ranald slipped away after him to beg that he  might be allowed to go with him to-morrow. Stealing silently through the  bushes he came to where he could see the kneeling figure of his uncle  swaying up and down, and caught the sounds of words broken with groans:    \"Let me go, O Lord! Let me go!\" He pled now in Gaelic and again in  English. \"Let not the man be escaping his just punishment. Grant me  this, O, Lord! Let me smite but once!\" Then after a pause came the  words, \"'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!' Vengeance is mine! Ay, it  is the true word! But, Lord, let not this man of Belial, this Papish,  escape!\" Then again, like a refrain would come the words, \"Vengeance is  mine. Vengeance is mine,\" in ever-deeper agony, till throwing himself on  his face, he lay silent a long time.    Suddenly he rose to his knees and so remained, looking steadfastly  before him into the woods. The wind came sighing through the pines with  a wail and a sob. Macdonald shuddered and then fell on his face again.  The Vision was upon him. \"Ah, Lord, it is the bloody hands and feet  I see. It is enough.\" At this Ranald slipped back awe-stricken to the  camp. When, after an hour, Macdonald came back into the firelight, his  face was pale and wet, but calm, and there was an exalted look in his  eyes. His men gazed at him with wonder and awe in their faces.    \"Mercy on us! He will be seeing something,\" said Big Mack to Yankee Jim.    \"Seein' somethin'? What? A bar?\" inquired Yankee.    \"Whist now!\" said Big Mack, in a low voice. \"He has the sight. Be quate  now, will you? He will be speaking.\"    For a short time Macdonald sat gazing into the fire in silence, then  turning his face toward the men who were waiting, he said: \"There will  be no more of this. 'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!' It is not for  me. The Lord will do His own work. It is the will of the Lord.\" And  the men knew that the last word had been said on that subject, and that  LeNoir was safe.        CHAPTER III    THE MANSE IN THE BUSH      Straight north from the St. Lawrence runs the road through the Indian  Lands. At first its way lies through open country, from which the forest  has been driven far back to the horizon on either side, for along the  great river these many years villages have clustered, with open fields  about them stretching far away. But when once the road leaves the  Front, with its towns and villages and open fields, and passes beyond  Martintown and over the North Branch, it reaches a country where the  forest is more a feature of the landscape. And when some dozen or more  of the crossroads marking the concessions which lead off to east and  west have been passed, the road seems to strike into a different world.  The forest loses its conquered appearance, and dominates everything.  There is forest everywhere. It lines up close and thick along the road,  and here and there quite overshadows it. It crowds in upon the little  farms and shuts them off from one another and from the world outside,  and peers in through the little windows of the log houses looking  so small and lonely, but so beautiful in their forest frames. At the  nineteenth cross-road the forest gives ground a little, for here the  road runs right past the new brick church, which is almost finished, and  which will be opened in a few weeks. Beyond the cross, the road leads  along the glebe, and about a quarter of a mile beyond the corner there  opens upon it the big, heavy gate that the members of the Rev. Alexander  Murray's congregation must swing when they wish to visit the manse. The  opening of this gate, made of upright poles held by auger-holes in a  frame of bigger poles, was almost too great a task for the minister's  seven-year-old son Hughie, who always rode down, standing on the hind  axle of the buggy, to open it for his father. It was a great relief  to him when Long John Cameron, who had the knack of doing things for  people's comfort, brought his ax and big auger one day and made a kind  of cradle on the projecting end of the top bar, which he then weighted  with heavy stones, so that the gate, when once the pin was pulled out  of the post, would swing back itself with Hughie straddled on the top of  it.    It was his favorite post of observation when waiting for his mother to  come home from one of her many meetings. And on this particular March  evening he had been waiting long and impatiently.    Suddenly he shouted: \"Horo, mamma! Horo!\" He had caught sight of the  little black pony away up at the church hill, and had become so wildly  excited that he was now standing on the top bar frantically waving his  Scotch bonnet by the tails. Down the slope came the pony on the gallop,  for she knew well that soon Lambert would have her saddle off, and that  her nose would be deep into bran mash within five minutes more. But her  rider sat her firmly and brought her down to a gentle trot by the time  the gate was reached.    \"Horo, mamma!\" shouted Hughie, clambering down to open the gate.    \"Well, my darling! have you been a good boy all afternoon?\"    \"Huh-huh! Guess who's come back from the shanties!\"    \"I'm sure I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#5)"],[1," most--a  tall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter  face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes  which might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a way  for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but spent his  days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth, or  in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess, over the  beautiful countryside. \"An easy-going, free-handed gentleman,\" said  Ames, the butler. \"But, my word! I had rather not be the man that  crossed him!\" He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no  less friendly with his wife--a friendship which more than once seemed  to cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were  able to perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one of  the family when the catastrophe occurred.    As to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a  large household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and  Mrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some  of her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no  relation to the events of the night of January 6th.    It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local  police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary.  Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and pealed  furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor  House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the breathless  burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within  a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the  crime a little after twelve o'clock, after taking prompt steps to warn  the county authorities that something serious was afoot.    On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge  down, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of wild  confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling together in  the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway.  Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions;  he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had  beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there arrived  Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village.  The three men entered the fatal room together, while the horror-stricken  butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind him to shut out  the terrible scene from the maid servants.    The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the  centre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which  covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet.  The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood  on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer  that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly  injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the  barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that this  had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge  in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had  been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more  destructive.    The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous  responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. \"We will touch  nothing until my superiors arrive,\" he said in a hushed voice, staring  in horror at the dreadful head.    \"Nothing has been touched up to now,\" said Cecil Barker. \"I'll answer  for that. You see it all exactly as I found it.\"    \"When was that?\" The sergeant had drawn out his notebook.    \"It was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was  sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not  very loud--it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down--I don't suppose it  was thirty seconds before I was in the room.\"    \"Was the door open?\"    \"Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom  candle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes  afterward.\"    \"Did you see no one?\"    \"No. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed  out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the  housekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back  into the room once more.\"    \"But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.\"    \"Yes, it was up until I lowered it.\"    \"Then how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question!  Mr. Douglas must have shot himself.\"    \"That was our first idea. But see!\" Barker drew aside the curtain, and  showed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent.  \"And look at this!\" He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of  blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. \"Someone has  stood there in getting out.\"    \"You mean that someone waded across the moat?\"    \"Exactly!\"    \"Then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he must  have been in the water at that very moment.\"    \"I have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the  window! But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never  occurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not  let her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.\"    \"Horrible enough!\" said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and  the terrible marks which surrounded it. \"I've never seen such injuries  since the Birlstone railway smash.\"    \"But, I say,\" remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common  sense was still pondering the open window. \"It's all very well your  saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is,  how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?\"    \"Ah, that's the question,\" said Barker.    \"At what o'clock was it raised?\"    \"It was nearly six o'clock,\" said Ames, the butler.    \"I've heard,\" said the sergeant, \"that it was usually raised at sunset.  That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.\"    \"Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,\" said Ames. \"I couldn't raise it  until they went. Then I wound it up myself.\"    \"Then it comes to this,\" said the sergeant: \"If anyone came from  outside--IF they did--they must have got in across the bridge before  six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room  after eleven.\"    \"That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing  before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him  in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the  window and left his gun behind him. That's how I read it; for nothing  else will fit the facts.\"    The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the  floor. The initials V.V. and under them the number 341 were rudely  scrawled in ink upon it.    \"What's this?\" he asked, holding it up.    Barker looked at it with curiosity. \"I never noticed it before,\" he  said. \"The murderer must have left it behind him.\"    \"V.V.--341. I can make no sense of that.\"    The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. \"What's V.V.?  Somebody's initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?\"    It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of  the fireplace--a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed  to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece.    \"Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,\" he said. \"I saw him  myself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it.  That accounts for the hammer.\"    \"We'd best put it back on the rug where we found it,\" said the sergeant,  scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. \"It will want the best  brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It will be a  London job before it is finished.\" He raised the hand lamp and walked  slowly round the room. \"Hullo!\" he cried, excitedly, drawing the window  curtain to one side. \"What o'clock were those curtains drawn?\"    \"When the lamps were lit,\" said the butler. \"It would be shortly after  four.\"    \"Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.\" He held down the light, and  the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. \"I'm bound to  say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the man got  into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and before six  when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room, because it was  the first that he saw. There was no other place where he could hide,  so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It  is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but Mr. Douglas  chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.\"    \"That's how I read it,\" said Barker. \"But, I say, aren't we wasting  precious time? Couldn't we start out and scout the country before the  fellow gets away?\"    The sergeant considered for a moment.    \"There are no trains before six in the morning; so he can't get away  by rail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it's odds that  someone will notice him. Anyhow, I can't leave here myself until I am  relieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly  how we all stand.\"    The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body.  \"What's this mark?\" he asked. \"Could this have any connection with the  crime?\"    The dead man's right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and  exposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious  brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief  upon the lard-coloured skin.    \"It's not tattooed,\" said the doctor, peering through his glasses. \"I"]]]
