Vis dominetur necesse est. Haec vident omnes.' Pro Sext.  sec. 42.]    Whether such a condition of human nature could ever exist, or if it  did, could continue so long as to merit the appellation of a STATE,  may justly be doubted. Men are necessarily born in a family-society, at  least; and are trained up by their parents to some rule of conduct and  behaviour. But this must be admitted, that, if such a state of mutual  war and violence was ever real, the suspension of all laws of  justice, from their absolute inutility, is a necessary and infallible  consequence.    The more we vary our views of human life, and the newer and more unusual  the lights are in which we survey it, the more shall we be convinced,  that the origin here assigned for the virtue of justice is real and  satisfactory.    Were there a species of creatures intermingled with men, which, though  rational, were possessed of such inferior strength, both of body and  mind, that they were incapable of all resistance, and could never, upon  the highest provocation, make us feel the effects of their resentment;  the necessary consequence, I think, is that we should be bound by the  laws of humanity to give gentle usage to these creatures, but should  not, properly speaking, lie under any restraint of justice with regard  to them, nor could they possess any right or property, exclusive of such  arbitrary lords. Our intercourse with them could not be called society,  which supposes a degree of equality; but absolute command on the one  side, and servile obedience on the other. Whatever we covet, they must  instantly resign: Our permission is the only tenure, by which they hold  their possessions: Our compassion and kindness the only check, by which  they curb our lawless will: And as no inconvenience ever results from  the exercise of a power, so firmly established in nature, the restraints  of justice and property, being totally USELESS, would never have place  in so unequal a confederacy.    This is plainly the situation of men, with regard to animals; and  how far these may be said to possess reason, I leave it to others to  determine. The great superiority of civilized Europeans above barbarous  Indians, tempted us to imagine ourselves on the same footing with regard  to them, and made us throw off all restraints of justice, and even of  humanity, in our treatment of them. In many nations, the female sex are  reduced to like slavery, and are rendered incapable of all property, in  opposition to their lordly masters. But though the males, when united,  have in all countries bodily force sufficient to maintain this severe  tyranny, yet such are the insinuation, address, and charms of their fair  companions, that women are commonly able to break the confederacy, and  share with the other sex in all the rights and privileges of society.    Were the human species so framed by nature as that each individual  possessed within himself every faculty, requisite both for his own  preservation and for the propagation of his kind: Were all society and  intercourse cut off between man and man, by the primary intention of the  supreme Creator: It seems evident, that so solitary a being would be  as much incapable of justice, as of social discourse and conversation.  Where mutual regards and forbearance serve to no manner of purpose,  they would never direct the conduct of any reasonable man. The headlong  course of the passions would be checked by no reflection on future  consequences. And as each man is here supposed to love himself alone,  and to depend only on himself and his own activity for safety and  happiness, he would, on every occasion, to the utmost of his power,  challenge the preference above every other being, to none of which he  is bound by any ties, either of nature or of interest. But suppose  the conjunction of the sexes to be established in nature, a family  immediately arises; and particular rules being found requisite for  its subsistence, these are immediately embraced; though without  comprehending the rest of mankind within their prescriptions. Suppose  that several families unite together into one society, which is totally  disjoined from all others, the rules, which preserve peace and order,  enlarge themselves to the utmost extent of that society; but becoming  then entirely useless, lose their force when carried one step farther.  But again suppose, that several distinct societies maintain a kind of  intercourse for mutual convenience and advantage, the boundaries of  justice still grow larger, in proportion to the largeness of men's  views, and the force of their mutual connexions. History, experience,  reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural progress of human  sentiments, and in the gradual enlargement of our regards to justice,  in proportion as we become acquainted with the extensive utility of that  virtue.        PART II.        If we examine the PARTICULAR laws, by which justice is directed,  and property determined; we shall still be presented with the same  conclusion. The good of mankind is the only object of all these laws  and regulations. Not only is it requisite, for the peace and interest  of society, that men's possessions should be separated; but the rules,  which we follow, in making the separation, are such as can best be  contrived to serve farther the interests of society.    We shall suppose that a creature, possessed of reason, but unacquainted  with human nature, deliberates with himself what rules of justice or  property would best promote public interest, and establish peace and  security among mankind: His most obvious thought would be, to assign the  largest possessions to the most extensive virtue, and give every one  the power of doing good, proportioned to his inclination. In a perfect  theocracy, where a being, infinitely intelligent, governs by particular  volitions, this rule would certainly have place, and might serve to the  wisest purposes: But were mankind to execute such a law; so great is  the uncertainty of merit, both from its natural obscurity, and from the  self-conceit of each individual, that no determinate rule of conduct  would ever result from it; and the total dissolution of society must  be the immediate consequence. Fanatics may suppose, THAT DOMINION IS  FOUNDED ON GRACE, and THAT SAINTS ALONE INHERIT THE EARTH; but the civil  magistrate very justly puts these sublime theorists on the same footing  with common robbers, and teaches them by the severest discipline, that a  rule, which, in speculation, may seem the most advantageous to society,  may yet be found, in practice, totally pernicious and destructive.    That there were RELIGIOUS fanatics of this kind in England, during  the civil wars, we learn from history; though it is probable, that the  obvious TENDENCY of these principles excited such horror in mankind, as  soon obliged the dangerous enthusiasts to renounce, or at least conceal  their tenets. Perhaps the LEVELLERS, who claimed an equal distribution  of property, were a kind of POLITICAL fanatics, which arose from the  religious species, and more openly avowed their pretensions; as carrying  a more plausible appearance, of being practicable in themselves, as well  as useful to human society. It must, indeed, be confessed, that nature  is so liberal to mankind, that, were all her presents equally divided  among the species, and improved by art and industry, every individual  would enjoy all the necessaries, and even most of the comforts of life;  nor would ever be liable to any ills but such as might accidentally  arise from the sickly frame and constitution of his body. It must also  be confessed, that, wherever we depart from this equality, we rob the  poor of more satisfaction than we add to the rich, and that the slight  gratification of a frivolous vanity, in one individual, frequently costs  more than bread to many families, and even provinces. It may appear  withal, that the rule of equality, as it would be highly USEFUL, is not  altogether IMPRACTICABLE; but has taken place, at least in an imperfect  degree, in some republics; particularly that of Sparta; where it was  attended, it is said, with the most beneficial consequences. Not to  mention that the Agrarian laws, so frequently claimed in Rome, and  carried into execution in many Greek cities, proceeded, all of them,  from a general idea of the utility of this principle.    But historians, and even common sense, may inform us, that, however  specious these ideas of PERFECT equality may seem, they are really,  at bottom, IMPRACTICABLE; and were they not so, would be extremely  PERNICIOUS to human society. Render possessions ever so equal, men's  different degrees of art, care, and industry will immediately break that  equality. Or if you check these virtues, you reduce society to the most  extreme indigence; and instead of preventing want and beggary in a  few, render it unavoidable to the whole community. The most rigorous  inquisition too is requisite to watch every inequality on its first  appearance; and the most severe jurisdiction, to punish and redress it.  But besides, that so much authority must soon degenerate into tyranny,  and be exerted with great partialities; who can possibly be possessed  of it, in such a situation as is here supposed? Perfect equality  of possessions, destroying all subordination, weakens extremely the  authority of magistracy, and must reduce all power nearly to a level, as  well as property.    We may conclude, therefore, that, in order to establish laws for the  regulation of property, we must be acquainted with the nature and  situation of man; must reject appearances, which may be false, though  specious; and must "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43282"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.No. 6.

The ice can be cut and sold at one and one half  cents a pound, and by the ship load at five dollars a ton.           *       *       *       *       *                              =MECHANICAL PUDDLING IN SWEDEN.=    The accompanying engravings, which we take from _Iron_, give plan and  section of the puddling apparatus invented by Mr. Oestlund, as used at  the Finspong Ironworks. The gas generator, A, is of the common Swedish  type, as used for charcoal. The tube, _k_, conducts the gases into the  refining pot, _a_. This pot has a lining of refinery slag, which is  melted, as the apparatus revolves, to get it to adhere to the sides. The  revolution of the pot, _a_, on its axis, _d_, is effected by the action  of the beveled wheels, _b_ and _b'_, and the pulley, _c_, which takes  from an iron chain the power given off by a turbine. The spindle, _d_,  is supported in the bearings, _e_ and _e', c_ carrying a pair of  trunnions which form the axis of oscillation, and allow the apparatus to  rise or fall, the whole of this mechanism being supported on the plummer  blocks, _f f_. One of the trunnions, _e''_, is prolonged so as to form  the axis of the beveled wheel, _b_, and the pulley, _c_, the latter  sliding along the trunnion so as to put _b_ in or out of gear. The bush,  _e_ is tied by means of the stay, _g'_ to the upper end of the toothed  segment, _g_, the lower extremity of which is connected with the second  bush at the end of the spindle. By means of the pinion, _h_, revolving  on standards, _i i_, and the segmental rack, _g_, the pot can be raised  or lowered without interfering with the action of the beveled wheels.    [Illustration: APPARATUS FOR MECHANICAL PUDDLING.]    The gas from the generator is brought to the mouth of the pot by the  tubes, _k_ and _m_. The air necessary for the combustion of the gas is  brought in by a tube, _l_, branching from the air main, _l''_. The air  tube, _l_, passes into the gas tube and is continued concentrically  within the latter. The gas and air tubes both have joints at _m'_ and  _m''_. By means of the bar, _n_, which has a counterpoise to keep the  moving parts in position, the tubes can be brought from or toward the  mouth of the pot, so as to make it free of access to the workman. With a  key fitting on the stem, _n'_, the tubes can be turned in _m'_, so as to  give the currents of gas and air a more or less oblique direction. To  screen the workmen from the heat of the pot a disk of iron, _o_, lined  with fire clay on the side next the pot, is fitted to the end of the  tubes.    [Illustration: APPARATUS FOR MECHANICAL PUDDLING.]    Before running the metal into the pot, the latter must be heated, to  such a degree that the slag lining is pasty or semi-fluid at its  surface. Generally an hour and a half will be spent in heating with gas  to this point. There should be sufficient live coal in the pot when the  gas is first let in to keep up its combustion; should it be extinguished  by excess of air or gas, it must be relit. As soon as the pot begins to  get red hot the full heat can be put on.    The gas generator is tended in the usual way with the ordinary  precautions. To keep ashes and dust out of the gas tube, lumps of  charcoal are heaped up to the height of the top of the flue. The wind  pressure for the generator was 33 to 41 millimeters of mercury, that of  the wind for the combustion of the gas (at Finspong the blast is not  heated) being only 16-1/2 millimeters. The pressure of the gas in the tube  near the pot was 6.2 millimeters of mercury. The method of working,  viewed chemically, does not sensibly differ from puddling; although  giving as good, perhaps better, results at a much less cost. There are  three principal periods in the operation: 1. The period before boiling.  2. The boiling itself. 3. The end of the boiling, and the formation of  balls. When cast metal is poured into the pot a shovelful or two of  refinery slag is added. The temperature of the bath is thus brought  down; it thickens and boils, the pot revolving at the rate of 30 or 40  revolutions a minute. The metal is worked with a rabble, either to cool  it or to get the slag to incorporate with it, as is done in puddling.  Note must be taken of the temperature of the melted metal and that of  the pot, at the moment of charging, the heat during working being  regulated accordingly by increasing or diminishing the inflow of air  and gas. When circumstances are favorable, boiling begins five minutes  after the metal is run into the pot, and it lasts about ten minutes.    Boiling having begun, the batch swells, the iron forms, granulates, and  seems to cling to the rabble and the sides of the pot. The rotation of  the pot is continued, as well as the working, to separate out parts  which are not yet refined; but no more cold cinder is put in. While  boiling goes on the temperature is regulated so that the pig does not  cling to the side of the pot during a complete revolution, but so that  the particles next the side fall back into the bath when the side comes  uppermost in the revolution. The heat is raised a little when the iron  can be felt by the rabble to be completely refined, when shining lumps  make their appearance in the bath, and the iron begins to cling to the  walls. At the moment, therefore, that the temperature is brought to its  highest point, and the iron begins to agglutinate, the rotation of the  pot should be stopped, and either immediately, or after the delay of a  couple of minutes, it is removed. If the iron does not ball well, it is  not completely refined, and the pot may be started again. If the iron is  firm enough already, the isolated particles are exposed to the hottest  flame possible, the blast being carried to its maximum. The refining is  thus completely finished, and all the particles are agglomerated. The  mobility of the gas tube at _m''_ is of advantage in this operation. It  is sometimes useful to start the pot again to round up the puddled ball,  but it is best if this has been formed with the rabble.    The iron from a charge of 75 kilos. of pig may be divided with advantage  into a couple of balls; a third may be made of the iron separated from  the walls of the pot. To get out the balls the pot is lowered, and the  workmen use tongs, pointed rabble, and hooked bar. If things have gone  well the balls ought to come out soft at a welding heat, filled with  cinder like puddled balls, but a little more resisting and solid under  the hammer. They are forged into bars, and these are at once passed to  the rolls. If nothing hinders the balling and shingling, these  operations will not consume more than fifteen minutes.           *       *       *       *       *                                 =Photographic Engraving.=    Scamoni's process is as follows: The original drawings are carefully  touched up, so that the whites are as pure and the blacks as intense as  possible, and then the negative is taken in the ordinary way, the plate  being backed in the camera with damp red blotting paper, to prevent  reflection from the camera or back of the plate. The negative is  developed in the ordinary manner, intensified by mercuric chloride, and  varnished. A positive picture is taken in the camera, the negative being  carefully screened from any light coming between it and the lens. This  is intensified by pyrogallic acid, and afterward washed with a pure  water to which a little ammonia has been added. It is then immersed in  mercuric chloride for half an hour, and again intensified with  pyrogallic acid. This is repeated several times. When the intensity of  the lines is considerable, the plate is well washed, treated with  potassium iodide, and finally with ammonia, the image successively  appearing yellow, green, brown, and then violet brown. The plate is then  thoroughly drained, and the image is treated successively with a  solution of platinic chloride, auric chloride, ferrous sulphate, and  finally by pyrogallic acid, which has the property of solidifying the  metallic deposits. The metallic relief thus obtained is dried over a  spirit lamp, and covered with an excessively thin varnish. This varnish,  which is evidently a special preparation, retains sufficient tackiness  to hold powdered graphite on its surface (the bronze powder now used may  be employed instead), which is dusted on in the usual manner. After  giving the plate a border of wax, it is placed in an electrotyping bath,  and a perfect facsimile in intaglio is obtained, from which prints may  be taken in a printing press.           *       *       *       *       *                               =A NEW DEEP SEA THERMOMETER.=    Perhaps some of our readers may have seen a description of a form of  thermometer devised by MM.
