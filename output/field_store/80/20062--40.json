The cap!    Garabato took out of an oval box with great care the fighting cap, black  and shining, with two pendent tassels, like ears of passementerie.  Gallardo put it on, taking care that the _coleta_ should remain  unhidden, hanging symmetrically down his back.    The cape!    Garabato caught up the cape from off a chair, the _capa de gala_, a  princely mantle of silk of the same shade as the dress and equally  burdened with gold embroidery. Gallardo hung it over one shoulder and  looked at himself in the glass, satisfied with his preparations. It was  not bad.    \"To the plaza!\"    His two friends took their farewells hastily and called a cab to follow  him. Garabato put under one arm a great bundle of red cloths, from the  ends of which peeped the hilts and guards of many swords.          CHAPTER II    THE MATADOR AND THE LADY      As Gallardo descended to the vestibule of the hotel he saw the street  filled with a dense and noisy crowd as though some great event had taken  place. The buzzing of the multitude outside the door reached his ears.  The proprietor and all his family appeared with extended hands as if  they would bid him farewell for a long journey.    \"Good luck! May all go well with you!\"    The servants, forgetting distance at the impulse of enthusiasm and  emotion, also held their right hands out to him.    \"Good luck, Don Juan!\"    And he turned in all directions smiling, regardless of the frightened  faces of the ladies of the hotel.    \"Thanks, many thanks! See you later.\"    He was a different man. From the moment he had hung the glittering cape  over one shoulder a persistent smile illuminated his countenance. He was  pale, with a sweaty pallor like that of the sick; but he smiled,  satisfied to live and to show himself in public, adopting his new pose  with the instinctive freedom of one who but needs an incentive to parade  before the people.    He swaggered with arrogance, puffing occasionally at the cigar he  carried in his left hand. He moved his hips haughtily under his handsome  cape and strode with a firm step and with the flippancy of a gay youth.    \"Come, gentlemen, make way! Many thanks; many thanks.\"    And he tried to preserve his dress from unclean contact as way was made  among an ill-clad, enthusiastic crowd which surged against the doors of  the hotel. They had no money with which to go to the bull-fight but they  took advantage of the opportunity of pressing the hand of the famous  Gallardo, or of at least touching his garments.    A coach drawn by four richly caparisoned mules with tassels and bells  stood waiting at the door. Garabato had already seated himself on the  box with his bundle of _muletas_ and swords. Three bull-fighters were  inside with their capes over their knees, dressed in gayly colored  clothes embroidered with as great profusion as the master's, but in  silver.    Pressed onward by the popular ovation, and having to defend himself with  his elbows from greedy hands, Gallardo reached the carriage-step.    \"Good-afternoon, gentlemen,\" he said shortly to the men of his  _cuadrilla_.    He seated himself at the back so that all could see him, and smiled with  responsive nods to the shouts of some ragged women and to the short  applause begun by some newsboys.    The carriage started with all the impetus of the spirited mules, filling  the street with gay ringing. The mob parted to give passage but many  rushed at the carriage as though they would fall under its wheels. Hats  and canes were waved; an explosion of enthusiasm burst from the crowd,  one of those contagions that agitate and madden the masses at certain  times--making every one shout without knowing why.    \"Hurrah for the brave! _Viva Espana!_\"    Gallardo, ever pale and smiling, saluted, repeating \"many thanks,\" moved  by the contagion of popular enthusiasm and proud of his standing which  united his name to that of his native land.    A troop of dishevelled youngsters ran after the coach at full speed, as  though convinced that, at the end of the mad race, something  extraordinary surely awaited them.    For at least an hour Alcala Street had been like a river of carriages  that flowed toward the outskirts of the city between two banks of  close-packed foot passengers. All kinds of vehicles, ancient and modern,  figured in this tumultuous and noisy emigration, from the ancient  diligence, brought to light like an anachronism, to the automobile.  Crowded tramways passed with groups of people overflowing on their  steps. Omnibuses carried people to the corner of Seville Street, while  the conductor shouted \"To the plaza! To the plaza!\" Tasselled mules with  jingling bells trotted ahead of open carriages in which rode women in  white _mantillas_ with bright flowers in their hair; every instant  exclamations of alarm were heard at the escape, by apelike agility, of  some boy beneath the wheels of a carriage as he crossed by leaps from  one sidewalk to the other defying the current of vehicles. Automobile  horns tooted; coachmen yelled; newsboys shouted the page with the  picture and history of the bulls that were to be fought, or the likeness  and biography of the famous _matadores_, and from time to time an  explosion of curiosity swelled the deafening roar of the crowd.    Among the dark steeds of the mounted police rode gayly dressed  _caballeros_ with their legs rigidly encased in yellow leggings,  wearing gilded jackets and beaver hats with heavy tassels in lieu of a  cockade, mounted on thin and miserable hacks. They were the _picadores_.  Aft on the crupper, behind the high Moorish saddle, rode an impish  figure dressed in red, the _mono sabio_, or servant who had brought the  troop of horses to their hostelry.    The _cuadrillas_ passed in open coaches, and the embroidery of the  bull-fighters, reflecting the afternoon light, seemed to dazzle the  crowd and excite its enthusiasm. \"That is Fuentes!\" \"That is Bomba!\" And  the people, pleased with the identification, followed the retreating  carriages with greedy stare as if something startling were going to  happen and they feared to be too late.    From the top of the hill on Alcala Street the broad straight road shone  white in the sun, with its rows of trees turning green at the breath of  spring, the balconies black with people, and the highway only visible at  intervals beneath the ant-like movement of the crowd and the rolling of  the coaches descending to the Fountain of Cibeles. Here the hill rose  again amid groves and tall buildings and the Puerta de Alcala closed the  perspective like a triumphal arch, rearing its perforated white mass  against the blue space in which flecks of clouds floated like solitary  swans.    Gallardo rode in silence, responding to the multitude with a fixed  smile. Since his greeting to the _banderilleros_ he had not spoken a  word. They were also silent and pale with anxiety over the unknown.  Being all bull-fighters together, they put aside as useless the  gallantries necessary before the public.    A mysterious influence seemed to tell the crowd of the passing of the  last _cuadrilla_ that wound its way to the plaza. The vagabonds that ran  behind the coach shouting after Gallardo had been outstripped and the  group scattered among the carriages, but in spite of this the people  turned their heads as if they divined the proximity of the celebrated  bull-fighter behind them and they stopped, lining up against the edge of  the sidewalk to see him better.    The women in the coaches in advance turned their heads, attracted by the  jingling bells of the trotting mules. An indescribable roar rose from  certain groups that barred the passage along the sidewalks. There were  enthusiastic exclamations. Some waved their hats; others lifted canes  and swung them in salutation.    Gallardo responded to all with grinning smile but in his preoccupation  he seemed to take small account of these greetings. At his side rode  Nacional, his confidential servant, a _banderillero_, older than himself  by ten years, a rugged, strong man with brows grown together and a grave  visage. He was famous among the men of the profession for his good  nature, his manliness, and his political enthusiasms.    \"Juan--don't complain of Madri',\" said Nacional; \"thou art made with the  public.\"    But Gallardo, as if he did not hear him and as if he wished to get away  from the thoughts that occupied him, answered:    \"I feel it in my heart that something's going to happen this afternoon.\"    When they arrived at Cibeles the coach stopped. A great funeral was  coming along the Prado from the Castellana, cutting through the  avalanche of carriages from Alcala Street.    Gallardo turned paler, contemplating with angry eyes the passing of the  cross and the defile of the priests who broke into a grave chant as they  gazed, some with aversion, others with envy, at that God-forgotten  multitude running after amusement.    Gallardo made haste to take off his cap, in which he was imitated by all  his _banderilleros_ except Nacional.    \"But damn it!\" yelled Gallardo, \"uncover, _condenao_!\"    He looked furious, as though he would strike him, convinced by some  confused intuition that this rebellion would cause the most terrible  misfortune to befall him.    \"Well, I take it off,\" said Nacional with the ill grace of a thwarted  child, as he saw the cross pass on, \"I take it off, but it is to the  dead.\"    They were detained some time to let the long _cortege_ pass.    \"Bad sign!\" muttered Gallardo in a voice trembling with anger. \"Whoever  would have thought of bringing a funeral along the road to the plaza?  Damn it! I say something's going to happen to-day!\"    Nacional smiled, shrugging his shoulders.    \"Superstitions and fanaticisms! Neither God nor Nature bothers over  these things.\"    These words, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#5)"],[1,"being cheaper. This is by far the best material in making  enclosures, yet found. Some of the first experimenters used boards, but  where there were cracks, or the sap or bark on edges rotted, affording  the animals a place to gnaw, they soon found a way out. This had to be  guarded against where the boards extended into the ground they often  rotted so that there was always danger of the animals escaping. Where  stones were set up edgewise or cement used, it was rather expensive and  as galvanized wire lasts well either in the ground, where not exposed to  the air, or being galvanized, it stands the elements well, it seems to  meet the requirements of the fur farmer for fencing or enclosure  purposes.    Where is the farmer who would expect to make a success at raising  horses, cattle or sheep, by keeping them in a small pen and feeding them  foods not to their liking or nature? Yet, such has been the case with  some of those who tried \"fur animal raising.\" They made a failure of it  and no one who is at all familiar with fur-bearing animals is surprised.  Those who will be successful at \"fur-farming\" are trappers, hunters and  farmers who know something of the animal or animals they expect to  raise--those who love the animal and have a desire for the business.    The ox, horse and sheep were all wild at one time, but have become  domesticated. Why not the same with the fur-bearers? This is exactly  what should be done. Skunk, especially, are very easily domesticated,  and other fur-bearers, such as coon, mink and opossum, soon lose much of  their fear.    When the raiser learns this and furnishes a large enclosure with dens  and food similar to their wild state, they will be on the road to  success. As one raiser says: \"They do well in a semi-wild state.\" If the  enclosure is too small, fleas, seed ticks, and other parasites are a  great enemy to the animals. In a large enclosure the animals are more  \"at home\" although at first they are restless and will walk around  seeking a way to escape; that is they try to escape at night. They are  seldom, if ever, seen during the day when first let loose in the  enclosure; they generally go in the first den that has been prepared for  them.    Water is important. If you are raising skunk, fox or opossum, water for  drinking is all that they require; the same is the case with the coon,  although they will do best where they have water to wade, play and  search for food. Muskrat, otter, beaver and mink must have water to swim  and play in, as well as to drink or they cannot be raised. The enclosure  for mink and muskrat should include a stream of running water if  possible, or a pond of pure water. The same conditions apply to otter  and beaver, but of course the wire should be of larger size than for  mink and muskrat. Several different species of fur-bearers can be  successfully raised in the same enclosure. Coon, opossum, and skunk will  all do well together. Beaver and otter, apparently, live peaceably for  weeks in the same beaver lodge or house.    The thousands of small lakes, ponds, etc., offer a splendid opportunity  for the successful raising of muskrat. While many owners of such, today,  in their natural condition, or without any fence, are reaping a  profitable and furry harvest; yet there are additional hundreds that by  building a fence around, would soon have a muskrat lake or pond worth a  great deal. Muskrat are fond of their homes and often remain at the same  location for years. If a wire fence three feet high were built around  this lake or pond, (with one foot underground), it would keep the rats  at home, as some would leave, especially as soon as the increase became  large. Such a fence would also keep out mink, which kill muskrat, often.    Muskrat, in their wild or natural homes, seldom leave the water more  than a rod or two, so that a pond a considerable distance from any  stream, would be a comparatively safe place to raise them, without any  enclosure. The danger would be, mainly, that after the animals became  quite plentiful, some would perhaps leave, for instinct seems to teach  them that some should seek homes not so crowded. This has happened in  their natural breeding places where they became very plentiful.    How large and where to build enclosures for fur farming, must be decided  by each individual. One party may have a creek, pond or lake, perhaps a  swamp, already inhabited by muskrat, and all that is necessary is to  keep other hunters and trappers off. On navigable rivers or lakes having  an inlet and outlet, we believe in most states any one can trap so long  as he is upon the water. In other words, the water does not belong to  the land owner and he cannot keep others off; but any small lake or pond  may be enclosed. On this point it would be well to see some lawyer in  your county, as different states may have different laws.    A wooded bluff containing some den trees for coon, and hollow logs,  stumps, etc., for opossum and skunk, would be an ideal place for a  fur-farm. The location of the farm should be within sight of the home of  the raiser, in case a dog should get within or a thief should visit the  farm. To guard against stealing at night your dog would give the alarm,  or you could have an electric appliance connect the farm with the  house.    Islands in large lakes offer a splendid place to begin raising  fur-bearing animals, and especially those that do not like to get their  \"fur wet\" or that naturally are not swimmers. In this class are the  various kinds of foxes, skunk and opossum; marten, it is true, are not  included in the swimming class, but the successful marten raiser perhaps  will be found, if at all, in the higher altitudes where the snow gets  several feet deep during the winter months, and the ground is covered  with snow eight or nine months each year--such is the ideal and natural  home of the marten.    Skunk and opossum are two animals that do not travel much in extreme  cold weather, so that an island in a lake or large river, could be used  with no fencing. It perhaps would be best to put up a wire fence but it  need not be so substantial as if it were not surrounded by water. Of  course islands in rivers that overflow, would not be suitable. There  are, however, islands in the Great Lakes and elsewhere, that can be used  for raising both skunk and opossum with little or no cash outlay at the  start.    If islands are used for foxes (except in salt water where the water does  not freeze), the same precaution in fencing must be taken as elsewhere.  Foxes travel during all kinds of weather and the first night the ice  formed sufficient to bear their weight, they would be very apt to  leave.    Coon could not be successfully raised on an island. They do not travel  much during severe weather, but unless the island happened to be some  distance from the mainland, they would likely swim to shore. Mink would  be at home on an island where there was fish, frogs, etc., with drift  and log piles to wander through, but as they are good swimmers, there  would be nothing gained by starting with this animal on an island.    Skunk and opossum seem to be the only animals that can be safely raised  on an island without the same precaution taken in fencing and enclosing,  as upon the mainland. These two animals, while not the highest priced  furred ones, for various reasons will prove to be as profitable, or more  so, where conditions favor, than many other fur-bearers.          CHAPTER IV.    BOX TRAP TRAPPING.      I was born in Central Pennsylvania and spent the greater part of my  early life among the mountains of that part of our country, writes Mr.  A. C. Williams, a well known trapper. From my early boyhood, I had a  decided liking for the wilder class of literature, and took special  interest in tales of hunting and trapping adventures; but at that time,  did not know that there were many who still followed hunting and  trapping for profit. When I did learn of it, I naturally became even  more interested, and tried to find a partner among my boy friends,  intending, if I could find some person to accompany me, to make an  extended hunting and trapping trip into some one of the wilder portions  of the West or North.    Of course I was no more fitted for such a trip than any other country  boy of the same age, and knew nothing of the wilderness; but being a  boy, and having read so many tales of boy hunters traversing the  wilderness as they would their own back yards, I naturally thought that  life in the forests was a very simple thing, and that there was no  reason why I should not go. As I grew older I learned that there was  still some fur to be found in Pennsylvania, and not only that but that  there were parties who made trapping a business, in season.    I was interested, and decided to try my hand on the fur-bearing animals  found near my own home, before going farther, but I had no traps and  knew nothing about the various sizes and grades; as a consequence, I  sought out one of the trappers that I had heard of, and asked his advice  regarding different traps for the various animals. He gave me the  desired information, very willingly, and also remarked that he had been  very successful in trapping mink and other small animals with box-traps.  After he had mentioned it, I remembered that my father had, on one  occasion, caught a mink in a box trap, after it had been paying nightly  visits to our chicken coop for a week or more, killing a hen each night;  but for all of that I did not know that these traps could be used  successfully when trapping for profit. It was not very long after my  conversation with this trapper, that I had an opportunity of examining  one of these wooden traps and studying its construction. I will give  here a description of the trap used in that section:    A plain box, size 10 by 10 by 24 inches, is made of one-inch lumber,  hardwood preferred, and is left"]]]
