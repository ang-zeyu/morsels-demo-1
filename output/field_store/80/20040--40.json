Fisher, who was the inventor, readily admitted at a later  date that he had not had the slightest idea of producing a sewing  machine, in the utilitarian meaning of the term. Although it has not  been established that this machine was ever put into practical  operation, Fisher's invention was to have a far-reaching effect on the  development of the sewing machine in England.

WILHELM RENTERS, _Praktisches Wissen von der  Naehmaschine_, p. 4, states that Krems used a hooked needle. Renters  probably mistook the hooked retaining pin for the needle.    [10] Dr. Dahmen, Burgermeister of Mayen, stated in a letter of October  8, 1963, that the original Krems machine was turned over to the  officials of Mayen by Krems' descendants about the turn of the century.  He verified that the machine used an eye-pointed needle. About 1920 the  machine was placed in the Eifelmuseum in Genovevaburg; some of the  unessential parts were restored. The machine now at this museum is the  one pictured in Luth's book. A replica of the machine is in the  Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany.    [11] JOSEF MADERSPERGER, _Beschreibung einer Naehmaschine_ (Vienna, ca.  1816). The exact date of this small booklet is not known. In the booklet  Madersperger reports that he had received a patent in 1814 for his  _first_ machine adapted to straight sewing. However, the machine  described and illustrated in this booklet was one that could stitch  semicircles and small figures. In _Kunst und Gewerbeblatt_, a periodical  (Munich, Germany, 1817, pp. 336-338), reference is made to the  Madersperger machine and a statement to the effect that the inventor had  published a leaflet describing his machine. The leaflet referred to is  believed to be the one under discussion. For this reason it must have  been published between 1814 and 1817, therefore ca. 1816. The only copy  of this booklet known to this author is in the New York Public Library.  It was probably not known to authors Luth and Renters. The author wishes  to thank Miss Rita J. Adrosko of her staff for her important help in  translating these German publications.    [12] _Sewing Machine Times_ (1907), vol. 26, no. 865, p. 1.    [13] There are no known models of these early Madersperger machines in  existence. Although the _Sewing Machine Times_ reported in the 1907  issue that the 1814 sewing machine was then on exhibition in the Museum  of the Vienna Polytechnic, the illustration shown was of Madersperger's  1839 machine. In a letter from the director of the Technisches Museum  fuer Industrie und Gewerbe in Vienna, received in 1962, it was stated  that the original 1814 Madersperger machine was in their museum. The  photographs that were sent, however, were of the 1839 machine. This  machine is entirely different from the 1814-1817 machine, as can readily  be seen by the reader (figs. 7 and 10).

F.  Thompson of the Singer company, is believed to have been one of the  machines lost in a Singer factory fire at Elizabethport, N.J., in 1890.    [26] Op. cit. (footnote 24).    [27] EDWARD H. KNIGHT, _Sewing Machines_, vol. 3 of _Knight's American  Mechanical Dictionary_.    [28] A seam using the saddler's stitch appears as a neat line of  touching stitches on both sides. Even when made by hand, it is sometimes  misidentified by the casual observer as the lockstitch because of the  uniformity of both sides. If the saddler's stitch was formed of threads  of two different colors, the even stitches on one side of the seam and  the odd stitches on the reverse side would be of one color, and vice  versa.    [29] _The Life and Works of George H. Corliss_, privately printed for  Mary Corliss by the American Historical Society, 1930. The Corliss  family records were turned over to the Baker Library, Harvard  University. In a letter addressed to this author by Robert W. Lovett of  the Manuscripts Division on August 2, 1954, it was reported that there  was a record on their Corliss card to the effect that a model of his  sewing machine, received with the collection, was turned over to the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology; however, Mr. Lovett also stated  that from a manuscript memoir of Mr. Corliss that it would seem that he  developed only the one machine--the patent model. In a letter dated  November 15, 1954, Stanley Backer, assistant professor of mechanical  engineering, stated that after extensive inquiries they were unable to  locate the model at M.I.T. In 1964, Dr. Robert Woodbury, of M.I.T.,  turned over to the Smithsonian Institution the official copies of the  Corliss drawings and the specifications which had been awarded to the  inventor by the Patent Office. It is possible that this may have been  the material noted on the Harvard University card as having been  transferred to M.I.T.

[32] In embroidery, couching is the technique of laying a decorative  thread on the surface of the fabric and stitching it into place with a  second less-conspicuous thread.          _Chapter Two_      [Illustration: Figure 14.--HOWE'S PREPATENT MODEL of 1845, and the box  used by the inventor to carry the machine to England in 1847.  (Smithsonian photo 45506-B.)]    Elements of a Successful Machine    The requirements for producing a successful, practical sewing machine  were a support for the cloth, a needle to carry the thread through the  fabric and a combining device to form the stitch, a feeding mechanism to  permit one stitch to follow another, tension controls to provide an even  delivery of thread, and the related mechanism to insure the precise  performance of each operation in its proper sequence. Weisenthal had  added a point to the eye-end of the needle, Saint supported the fabric  by placing it in a horizontal position with a needle entering  vertically, Duncan successfully completed a chainstitch for embroidery  purposes, Chapman used a needle with an eye at its point and did not  pass it completely through the fabric, Krems stitched circular caps with  an eye-pointed needle used with a hook to form a chainstitch, Thimonnier  used the hooked needle to form a chainstitch on a fabric laid  horizontally, and Hunt created a new stitch that was more readily  adapted to sewing by machine than the hand stitches had been, but,  although each may have had the germ of an idea, a successful machine had  not evolved. There were to be hundreds of patents issued in an attempt  to solve these and the numerous minor problems that would ensue. But the  problems were solved. And, in spite of its Old World inception, the  successful sewing machine can be credited as an American invention.    Although the invention of the practical sewing machine, like most  important inventions, was a many-man project, historians generally give  full credit to Elias Howe, Jr. Though such credit may be overly  generous, Howe's important role in this history cannot be denied.

To music's softest sounds they dance away the hour,    Till moon-light steals down among the trembling leaves,   And checquers all the ground, and guides them to the bow'r,    The long haunted bow'r, where the nightingale grieves.     Then no more they dance, till her sad song is done,    But, silent as the night, to her mourning attend;   And often as her dying notes their pity have won,    They vow all her sacred haunts from mortals to defend.     When, down among the mountains, sinks the ev'ning star,    And the changing moon forsakes this shadowy sphere,   How cheerless would they be, tho' they fairies are,    If I, with my pale light, came not near!     Yet cheerless tho' they'd be, they're ungrateful to my love!    For, often when the traveller's benighted on his way,   And I glimmer in his path, and would guide him thro' the grove,    They bind me in their magic spells to lead him far astray;     And in the mire to leave him, till the stars are all burnt out,    While, in strange-looking shapes, they frisk about the ground,   And, afar in the woods, they raise a dismal shout,    Till I shrink into my cell again for terror of the sound!     But, see where all the tiny elves come dancing in a ring,    With the merry, merry pipe, and the tabor, and the horn,   And the timbrel so clear, and the lute with dulcet string;    Then round about the oak they go till peeping of the morn.     Down yonder glade two lovers steal, to shun the fairy-queen,    Who frowns upon their plighted vows, and jealous is of me,   That yester-eve I lighted them, along the dewy green,    To seek the purple flow'r, whose juice from all her spells can  free.     And now, to punish me, she keeps afar her jocund band,    With the merry, merry pipe, and the tabor, and the lute;   If I creep near yonder oak she will wave her fairy wand,    And to me the dance will cease, and the music all be mute.     O! had I but that purple flow'r whose leaves her charms can foil,    And knew like fays to draw the juice, and throw it on the wind,   I'd be her slave no longer, nor the traveller beguile,    And help all faithful lovers, nor fear the fairy kind!     But soon the VAPOUR OF THE WOODS will wander afar,    And the fickle moon will fade, and the stars disappear,   Then, cheerless will they be, tho' they fairies are,    If I, with my pale light, come not near!    Whatever St. Aubert might think of the stanzas, he would not deny his  daughter the pleasure of believing that he approved them; and, having  given his commendation, he sunk into a reverie, and they walked on in  silence.         A faint erroneous ray   Glanc'd from th' imperfect surfaces of things,   Flung half an image on the straining eye;   While waving woods, and villages, and streams,   And rocks, and mountain-tops, that long retain   The ascending gleam, are all one swimming scene,   Uncertain if beheld.*       *Thomson.      St. Aubert continued silent till he reached the chateau, where his wife  had retired to her chamber. The languor and dejection, that had lately  oppressed her, and which the exertion called forth by the arrival of  her guests had suspended, now returned with increased effect. On the  following day, symptoms of fever appeared, and St. Aubert, having sent  for medical advice, learned, that her disorder was a fever of the same  nature as that, from which he had lately recovered. She had, indeed,  taken the infection, during her attendance upon him, and, her  constitution being too weak to throw out the disease immediately, it had  lurked in her veins, and occasioned the heavy languor of which she had  complained. St. Aubert, whose anxiety for his wife overcame every other  consideration, detained the physician in his house. He remembered the  feelings and the reflections that had called a momentary gloom upon his  mind, on the day when he had last visited the fishing-house, in company  with Madame St. Aubert, and he now admitted a presentiment, that this  illness would be a fatal one. But he effectually concealed this from  her, and from his daughter, whom he endeavoured to re-animate with hopes  that her constant assiduities would not be unavailing. The physician,  when asked by St. Aubert for his opinion of the disorder, replied,  that the event of it depended upon circumstances which he could not  ascertain. Madame St. Aubert seemed to have formed a more decided one;  but her eyes only gave hints of this. She frequently fixed them upon her  anxious friends with an expression of pity, and of tenderness, as if she  anticipated the sorrow that awaited them, and that seemed to say, it was  for their sakes only, for their sufferings, that she regretted life. On  the seventh day, the disorder was at its crisis. The physician assumed  a graver manner, which she observed, and took occasion, when her family  had once quitted the chamber, to tell him, that she perceived her death  was approaching. 'Do not attempt to deceive me,' said she, 'I feel that  I cannot long survive. I am prepared for the event, I have long, I hope,  been preparing for it. Since I have not long to live, do not suffer a  mistaken compassion to induce you to flatter my family with false hopes.  If you do, their affliction will only be the heavier when it arrives: I  will endeavour to teach them resignation by my example.'    The physician was affected; he promised to obey her, and told St.  Aubert, somewhat abruptly, that there was nothing to expect. The latter  was not philosopher enough to restrain his feelings when he received  this information; but a consideration of the increased affliction which  the observance of his grief would occasion his wife, enabled him,  after some time, to command himself in her presence. Emily was at first  overwhelmed with the intelligence; then, deluded by the strength of her  wishes, a hope sprung up in her mind that her mother would yet recover,  and to this she pertinaciously adhered almost to the last hour.    The progress of this disorder was marked, on the side of Madame St.  Aubert, by patient suffering, and subjected wishes. The composure, with  which she awaited her death, could be derived only from the retrospect  of a life governed, as far as human frailty permits, by a consciousness  of being always in the presence of the Deity, and by the hope of a  higher world. But her piety could not entirely subdue the grief of  parting from those whom she so dearly loved. During these her last  hours, she conversed much with St. Aubert and Emily, on the prospect of  futurity, and on other religious topics. The resignation she expressed,  with the firm hope of meeting in a future world the friends she left in  this, and the effort which sometimes appeared to conceal her sorrow at  this temporary separation, frequently affected St. Aubert so much as to  oblige him to leave the room. Having indulged his tears awhile, he would  dry them and return to the chamber with a countenance composed by an  endeavour which did but increase his grief.    Never had Emily felt the importance of the lessons, which had taught her  to restrain her sensibility, so much as in these moments, and never had  she practised them with a triumph so complete. But when the last was  over, she sunk at once under the pressure of her sorrow, and then  perceived that it was hope, as well as fortitude, which had hitherto  supported her. St. Aubert was for a time too devoid of comfort himself  to bestow any on his daughter.        CHAPTER II       I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word   Would harrow up thy soul.       SHAKESPEARE      Madame St. Aubert was interred in the neighbouring village church; her  husband and daughter attended her to the grave, followed by a long train  of the peasantry, who were sincere mourners of this excellent woman.    On his return from the funeral, St. Aubert shut himself in his chamber.  When he came forth, it was with a serene countenance, though pale in  sorrow. He gave orders that his family should attend him. Emily only was  absent; who, overcome with the scene she had just witnessed, had retired  to her closet to weep alone. St. Aubert followed her thither: he took  her hand in silence, while she continued to weep; and it was some  moments before he could so far command his voice as to speak. It  trembled while he said, 'My Emily, I am going to prayers with my family;  you will join us. We must ask support from above. Where else ought we to  seek it--where else can we find it?'    Emily checked her tears, and followed her father to the parlour, where,  the servants being assembled, St. Aubert read, in a low and solemn  voice, the evening service, and added a prayer for the soul of the  departed. During this, his voice often faltered, his tears fell upon the  book, and at length he paused. But the sublime emotions of pure devotion  gradually elevated his views above this world, and finally brought  comfort to his heart.    When the service was ended, and the servants were withdrawn, he tenderly  kissed Emily, and said, 'I have endeavoured to teach you, from your  earliest youth, the duty of self-command; I have pointed out to you the  great importance of it through life, not only as it preserves us in  the various and dangerous temptations that call us from rectitude and  virtue, but as it limits the indulgences which are termed virtuous,  yet which, extended beyond a certain boundary, are vicious, for their  consequence is evil. All excess is vicious; even that sorrow, which is  amiable in its origin, becomes a selfish and unjust passion, if indulged  at the expence of our duties--by our duties I mean what we owe to  ourselves, as well as to others. The indulgence of excessive grief  enervates the mind, and almost incapacitates it for again partaking of  those various innocent enjoyments which"]]]
