This redoubtable problem, however, is solved in the construction of  this curious little instrument that every butterfly carries.    The junction of the two grooved surfaces that form the tube is effected by  the same contrivance that reunites the web of a feather when it has been  pulled apart. We all know how completely it is made whole again, and on  examining by what means this result is brought about, we find that it is by  the interlacing of a {26} number of small fibres or hairs, just as, on a  larger scale, a pair of brushes adhere when pressed face to face; and so in  the butterfly's sucker, the two edges that join to form the tube are  closely set with minute bristles that, when brought together, interlock so  closely as to make an air-tight surface.    Fig. 9, Plate II., is a transverse section taken near the base of the  sucker, the small opening at the top being the food passage, those at the  side the air-tubes that supply air for respiration and perhaps assist in  suction.    The tube is probably made with separable parts in order that if its  interior should become at any time clogged by grosser particles drawn up  with the flower nectar, it may be opened and cleansed by the insect;  otherwise, the tube once rendered impassable, the insect would speedily  starve, as this narrow channel is the only inlet for the creature's  nourishment--its only mouth, in fact, for no butterfly possesses jaws to  bite with, or can take any but the liquid food pumped up by suction through  this pipe.    At the end of the proboscis--or, as it is called scientifically, the  Haustellum[3]--there are visible in some butterflies a number of small  projections, of the form shown at fig. 10, Plate II., which is a highly  magnified figure of the end of the Red Admiral's proboscis. These  appendages are generally supposed to be organs of taste, {27} and to aid in  the discrimination of food when the pipe is unrolled and thrust down deep  into the nectary of a flower.    The _compound eye_ of a butterfly, wonderful as its structure is, does not  greatly differ from that of many other insects, being like them composed of  an immense number of little lenses set together to form a hemisphere large  in comparison with the insect's head. A portion of one of these eyes forms  a pretty and interesting object for the microscope, presenting a honey-comb  appearance, the hexagonal lines that mark the division of the lenses being  most beautifully geometrical and regular in their arrangement. More than  seventeen hundred of these lenses have been counted in a single eye, and  each of these is considered to possess the qualities of a complete and  independent eye. If this be true, the butterfly may be said to be endowed  with at least thirty-four thousand eyes!    There exist also, as in other insects, _two simple_ eyes, placed on the top  of the head, but so buried in down and scales as to be neither visible, nor  useful for vision as far as we can perceive; probably the creature finds  that his allowance of thirty-four thousand windows to his soul lets in as  much light as he requires.    Every one looking at a butterfly must have remarked its long horns, called  _antennae_,[4] which project from above the eyes, like jointed threads,  thickening--in some {28} species gradually, in others suddenly--into a club  or knob at the extremity; a peculiarity which, it will be remembered, was  pointed out at the commencement, as a prominent mark of distinction between  butterflies and moths.    Very graceful appendages are these waving _antennae_, and evidently of high  importance to their owner; but still, their exact office or function is  unknown, notwithstanding that many guesses and experiments have been made  with a view of settling that question.    Investigators have perhaps erred, by assuming at the outset that these  antennae _must_ be organs of some sense that we ourselves possess; whereas,  I think that there is much evidence to show that insects are gifted with a  certain subtle sense, for which we have no name, and of which we can have  as little real idea, as we could have had of the faculty of sight, had all  the world been born blind.    For example; if you breed from the chrysalis a female Kentish Glory Moth,  and then immediately take her--in a closed box, mind--out into her native  woods, within a short space of time an actual crowd of male \"Glories\" come  and fasten upon, or hover over, the prison-house of the coveted maiden.  Without this magic attraction, you might walk in these same woods for a  whole day and not see a single specimen, the Kentish Glory being generally  reputed a very rare moth; while as many as some 120 males have been thus  decoyed to their capture in a few hours, by the charms of a couple of lady  \"Glories,\" shut up in a box.    [Illustration: V.]    {29}    Now, which of our five senses, I would ask--even if developed into  extraordinary acuteness in the insect--would account for such an exhibition  of clairvoyance as this?    May not, then, this undiscovered sense, whatever may be its nature, reside  in the antennae? for it is a remarkable fact, that the very moths, such as  the Eggers, the Emperor, the Kentish Glory, &c., which display the  above-mentioned phenomenon most signally, have the _antennae in the males_  amplified with numerous spreading branches, so as to present an unusually  large sensitive surface. This seems to point to some connexion between  those organs and the faculty of discovering the presence, and even the  condition, of one of their own race, with more, perhaps, than a mile of  distance, and the sides of a wooden box, intervening between themselves and  their object.    Whilst writing this, the current number of the \"Entomologist's Weekly  Intelligencer\" has arrived, and I there read that Dr. Clemmens, an American  naturalist, has been lately experimenting on the antennae of some large  American moths, for the purpose of gaining some information as to their  function. The article, though very interesting, is too long for quotation  here; but it appears that with the moths in question, a deprivation of the  whole, or even part of the antennae, interferes with, or entirely  annihilates the power {30} of flight, so that the creature when thus shorn,  but not otherwise injured, if thrown into the air seems to have no idea of  using his wings properly, but with a purposeless flutter tumbles headlong  to the earth. Still this merely goes to prove that the antennae are the  instruments of some important sense, one of whose uses is to guide the  creature's flight; but as many wingless insects have large antennae, this  evidently is not their only function.    The antennae are also often styled the \"feelers;\" but with our present  incomplete knowledge of their nature, the former term is preferable, as it  does not attempt to define their use as the word \"feelers\" does.    Considerable variety of form exists in the clubbed tip of the antennae in  various butterflies, as will be seen by reference to Plate II., where three  of the most distinct forms are shown considerably magnified. Fig. 12 is the  upper part of the antenna of the High-brown Fritillary (_Argynnis Adippe_),  the end suddenly swelling into a distinct knob. Fig. 13 is that of the  Swallow-tail Butterfly (_Papilio Machaon_), the enlargement here being more  gradual; and fig. 14 is that of the Large Skipper Butterfly (_Pamphila  Sylvanus_), distinguished by the curved point that surmounts the club.  These differences in the forms of the antennae are found to be excellent  aids in the classification of butterflies, and I shall therefore have  occasion to refer to them more minutely in describing the insects in  detail.    The stems of these organs are found to be tubular, {31} and at the point of  junction with the head the base is spread out (as shown at fig. 15),  forming what engineers call a \"flange,\" to afford sufficient support for  the long column above.    The _legs_ are the last portions of the butterfly framework that require  especial notice, on account of a peculiar variation they are subject to in  different family groups.    It may be laid down as an axiom, that _all true insects have six legs_, in  one shape or another; and butterflies, being insects, are obedient to the  same universal rule, and duly grow their half-dozen legs; but in certain  tribes the front pair, for no apparent reason, are so short and imperfect  as to be totally useless for walking purposes, though they may possibly be  used as hands for polishing up the proboscis, &c. So the butterfly in this  case _appears_, to a hasty observer, to have only _four_ legs.    This peculiarity is a constant feature in several natural groups of  butterflies, and therefore, in conjunction with other marks, such as the  veining of the wings and the shape of the antennae, its presence or absence  is a most useful mark of distinction, in classifying or searching out the  name and systematic place of a butterfly.           *       *       *       *       *      {32}    CHAPTER III.        WHAT BUTTERFLIES NEVER DO--GROUNDLESS TERROR--A MISTAKE--USES OF      BUTTERFLIES--MORAL OF BUTTERFLY LIFE--PSYCHE--THE BUTTERFLY AN EMBLEM      OF THE SOUL--THE ARTIST AND THE BUTTERFLY.    Among the _negative_ attributes of butterflies, I may state positively,  that _no butterfly whatever can either sting or bite in the least degree_;  and from their total harmlessness towards the person of man, conjoined with  their outward attractiveness, they merit and enjoy an exemption from those  feelings of dread and disgust that attach to many, or, I may say, to almost  all other tribes of insects; even to their equally harmless near relatives  the larger moths. At least, it has never been my misfortune to meet with a  person weak-minded enough to be afraid of a butterfly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#5)"],[1,"summer or autumn evening.  Thousands of these must perish, but a certain number of the females accept  the responsibility of starting a fresh nest, and so the ant population is  kept up. {30} It will be seen from these remarks that the three social  groups are very distinct in their methods of nest making, and have really  very little in common except the social habit. The humble bees have their  cuckoos; one species of wasp has a cuckoo, and there is a possible case of  a cuckoo amongst the continental ants, but this has not yet been observed  in this country. The ants harbour so many species of insects in their nests  besides their own family that it is difficult to form an idea as to whether  the case in question is at all analogous to that of host and cuckoo in the  other aculeates or not.           *       *       *       *       *    {31}    THE ANTS    These little creatures are probably the most intelligent of all the  insects--and yet at times they seem to wander about almost aimlessly. A  worker may be found with an insect or something which it is eagerly  dragging along and drops probably from fear. It appears anxious to regain  its hold of it, but goes about in all sorts of wrong directions before it  again finds it, it may be to make sure its enemy is clear away before it  resumes operations, but the effect to the ordinary onlooker is one of sheer  incapacity--at the same time the wonderful habits of the tribe, the way in  which they keep plant lice for their larvae, their methods of carrying each  other, their nest-building, and the slave-making instincts of some of the  species, show an intelligence surpassed by no other family of insects.  Their nests are formed in very various ways: the same species even will  sometimes nest under a stone and sometimes make ant hills; some {32} of the  large species make their nests of huge heaps of fir needles, and number 400  to 500 thousand in one nest--others live in quite small communities,  nesting in bramble stems, old rotten wood, moss, etc. One little species,  rare with us, lives in the walls of other ants' nests, just as mice live in  the walls of our houses; another quite small species lives apparently on  friendly terms with the common large red or horse ant, and may be found  running about amongst them, on and in their nests, but, so far as I know,  nothing is known as to how its young are reared. There is a curious  division in the family between the ants that have true stings and those  which have not. The large ants of our fir woods can bite and are able to  eject poison through the apical opening of the body into the wound they  create, but these as well as the larger and smaller black ants and some  others have the sting undeveloped, whereas some of our small species have a  sting which they can use with considerable effect; this difference in habit  is accompanied by a difference in the structure in the basal segments of  the body. In the stingless species the basal segment is reduced {33}  [Illustration: FIG. 6] to a flat upright transverse scale (fig. 6, 1); in  the stinging ants two segments at the base are reduced to nodes (fig. 6,  3). There is an exception in the case of one little rare genus, _Ponera_,  which has only the basal abdominal segment reduced to a scale although a  much thicker scale than in the others (fig. 6, 2), and yet which has a  distinct sting. These arrangements give the body very free movement so that  the tail can be bent forward till it reaches the head. Another curious  distinction between the stingers and non-stingers is that the larvae of the  former spin cocoons and those of the latter do not; the larvae of _Formica  fusca_ occasionally do not do so, but they are an exception to the rule.  Cocoon spinning seems to involve the larvae in some difficulties, as  without the help of the worker ants they are often unable to extract  themselves from their prison. This is a condition which does not, I  believe, exist in other groups. In the stingless ants there is a curious  difference in habit between the {34} species of the genus _Formica_, where,  according to Forel, the workers do not follow in line over unknown ground,  and frequently carry one another, the one carried being rolled up under the  head of the other, and the species of _Lasius_, where the workers follow  one another in line, but never carry each other. Among the stinging ants  another method of carrying occurs in certain genera. The porter seizes the  one she wishes to carry by the external edge of one of her mandibles and  then throws her over her back, so that she lies along the back of her  porter with her ventral aspect uppermost and her legs and antennae folded  as in the nymph state. Neither of these methods sounds very comfortable,  but then probably an ant's idea of comfort and our own may be very  different.    Lord Avebury, in his _Ants, Bees and Wasps_, tells us that he has known a  male of _Myrmica ruginodis_ live for nine months, although no doubt, as he  says, they generally die almost immediately, and he has known queen ants to  live for seven years, and workers, which he had in his nest, for six years.           *       *       *       *       *    {35}    THE SOCIAL WASPS    Of these we have only seven different kinds, and with the exception of the  hornet they are all very much alike. One often hears people say that they  have seen such a large wasp that they think it must have been a hornet, but  no one who has ever seen a hornet could mistake a wasp for one. A hornet is  _red-brown_ with yellow markings (pl. B, 13), a wasp is _black_ and yellow,  and altogether a less formidable-looking creature (pl. B, 14). Even a queen  wasp is not so large as a small worker hornet. The hornet nests in hollow  trees, our three commoner wasps nest, as a rule, in the ground, but  occasionally in outhouses, under roofs, etc. One of the others as a rule  makes its nest in shrubs, but occasionally in the ground, another always  nests in a bush or shrub, preferring a gooseberry or currant bush, and the  only remaining one is a cuckoo of one of the ground species. The  gooseberry-bush {36} wasp is not a common species in the south, but in the  midlands and north it is abundant. Wasps will eat most things, but are  especially fond of syrups and sweets. One species, _Vespa sylvestris_,  which seldom enters our houses, is very partial to the flowers of  _Scrophularia_ (Figwort). One rarely finds a plant of this in full blossom  without finding its attendant wasps. I have seen other species of wasps  also visiting it, but _sylvestris_ is practically sure to be there. The  diet which wasps provide for their larvae is probably a mixed one, but  consists largely of insects. Dr. Ormerod says that a microscopic  examination of the contents of a larval stomach shows \"the mass to consist  of scales, hairs and other fragments of insects, hairs of vegetables and  other substances less easy of recognition.\"    [Illustration: PLATE B.    10. _Colletes succinctus_, _female._ 11. _Sphecodes subquadratus_,  _female._ 12. _Halictus leucozonius_, _female._ 13. _Vespa crabro_,  _female._ 14. _Vespa vulgaris_, _female._ 15. _Andrena fulva_, _male._ 16.  _Andrena fulva_, _female._ 17. _Panurgus banksianus_, _female._ 18. _Nomada  ruficornis_, _var. signata_, _female._ 19. _Epeolus rufipes_, _female._    [_face p. 36._ ]    {37} Wasps do not store honey in their nest; the papery nature of their  cells would make such storage impossible. I dare say some of my readers  will have noticed wasps sitting in the sun on a wooden paling busily  engaged apparently eating something--they are really pulling off little  fibres of wood which they chew up into a substance fitted for the walls of  their cells; they will also chew paper, and the experiment has been tried  of giving them coloured papers, which resulted in stripes of colour  appearing in their nests. The different species vary somewhat in the  architecture of their nests; but they are built very much on the same  general plan. The population of some underground nests is very large. The  Rev. G. A. Crawshay estimated the number in a large nest of _Vespa  vulgaris_, which he took on September 20, 1904, at about 12,000; of these  he actually counted, including eggs and larvae, 11,370, and estimated the  rest as having left the nest and escaped, so that anyhow the computation  cannot be far wrong. This, however, was probably a very large nest. The  cuckoo wasp (_Vespa austriaca_), formerly known as _V. arborea_, is an  associate of _Vespa rufa_; its habits had been suspected for a long time,  but Mr. Robson set all doubts at rest by finding the nymphs of the cuckoo  in the actual nest of _rufa_. It is a rare species in the south, but far  from uncommon as one goes north, and also in Ireland, where the  relationship of the host and cuckoo have been {38} carefully studied by  Prof. Carpenter and Mr. Pack Beresford. _Vespa vulgaris_ has a beetle  parasite, but this is somewhat of a rarity. This creature _Metoecus  paradoxus_ lays its egg in the cell of the wasp, and enters the body of the  larva, eventually entirely devouring it. The hornet also has a beetle  associate, but this is a great rarity. It is a large black species of the  \"Devil's coach horse\" or \"Cock tail\" tribe (_Velleius dilatatus_), but in  what relation it stands to the hornet beyond inhabiting its nest is not  known.           *       *       *       *       *    {39}    THE HUMBLE BEES    Of these beautiful creatures we have thirteen kinds in this country. Their  velvety clothing and bright colours make them the favourites of most  people. They are most industrious and may be seen on the wing from early  morning often till quite late on summer evenings, whereas the solitary bees  do not, as a rule, commence work till nine or ten in the morning, except in  very hot weather, and generally retire about four or five p.m. There is an  idea prevalent that humble"]]]
