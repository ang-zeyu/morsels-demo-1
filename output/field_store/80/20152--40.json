(25.) _Structure of the Skin._--The skin is composed of three coats,  or layers; the outermost, the cuticle or scarf-skin, is a thin  delicate membrane, devoid of feeling, and of a scaly texture, pierced  by innumerable small holes, for the passage of the hairs, and  perspiration, and covering the next, or mucous coat, so named from its  pulpy appearance. In this resides the colouring matter, which imparts  its peculiar tints to the hair, and which can only be satisfactorily  demonstrated in the dark races. The existence of this coat has been by  some denied; but it is probable that, though present in all, it can  only be exhibited in such as have depth of tint, to admit of the  display. It is here that sensation principally resides; the nerves, or  rather their terminations, ramifying minutely in its substance, at  which they have arrived by piercing the third tunic, or true skin, a  dense firm elastic membrane, in which the roots of the hairs are  imbedded, and from which, in fact, they take their origin.    (26.) _Sebaceous Follicles._--The skin is studded over by small  glands, or what, in anatomical language, would be called sebaceous  follicles, which vary in number in different breeds, and different  parts of the body, being most numerous on the breast and shoulders,  and secreting a peculiar unctuous semi-solid matter, which, as we  shall immediately see, possesses alkaline properties.    (27.) _Connection of the hair with the skin_--_Yolk._--A hair  implanted in the skin may be compared to a plant growing in a  flower-pot which has been sunk in the earth, as the root of the hair  does not rise directly from the true skin, but from a little cup  extending from it to the cuticle, and receiving nourishment from  surrounding vessels. After coming to the surface of these tunics it  has, in the sheep, yet another, and, in some respects, remarkable  covering to pierce, one which has occupied the attention of the most  distinguished chemists, and given rise to a good deal of disputation  on the subject of salving--we allude to the Yolk. It is supposed by  many to be the inspissated secretion of the sebaceous follicles, and  receives its name from its adhesiveness and colour. It is most  plentiful on fine-woolled sheep, those of the south possessing more  than those of the north of our island, while merinos possess most of  all; so that there is apparently some connection between a fine  fleece, and a good supply of this matter. According to the analysis of  M. Vauquelin, it consists principally of a soapy matter, with a basis  of potash; a small quantity of carbonate of potash; a minute quantity  of acetate of potash; lime in an unknown state of combination; and an  atom of muriate of potash. It owes its odour to a small quantity of  animal oil, and is in every respect a true soap, which would permit  the sheep to be completely washed in a stream, but for the existence  in the fleece of an uncombined fatty matter, which remains attached to  the wool, and renders it rather glutinous.    Many have tried to account for the uses of the Yolk, but nothing like  satisfactory conclusions have been come to: some considering it goes  to form the filament, and is consolidated into a transparent mass  while the pile is growing; while others argue, that it is a peculiar  secretion which exudes through the skin, and by mixing with the pile  renders it soft and pliable, affecting it in the way that oil does a  piece of leather. In the latter opinion I coincide. For my part, I  view it as a secretion, depending very much on good food and  steadiness of temperature, and, therefore, indicative of a fine fleece  only so far as the health of the animal is concerned. In the human  being the state of the skin may often guide us, though blind-fold, to  the quality of the hair, so that the latter may be pronounced either  dry and coarse, or glossy, soft, and silky, as the skin may prove  either harsh and ungrateful, or pleasant, and, if I may be allowed the  expression, alkaline to the touch. Every thing having a tendency to  affect the health may always be considered as calculated to diminish  this secretion, and, consequently, to deteriorate the quality of the  wool.    The relative positions of the layers of the skin, the mode in which  the hairs rise from them, and the form and situation of the sebaceous  follicles, will be better understood by referring to the following  cross section Fig 5. Pl. V., in which the line marked        _a_ Represents the cuticle,      _b_ The mucous layer,      _c_ The true skin,      _d_ Sebaceous follicles,      _e_ Hairs rising from the true skin and inflections of the            upper layers and piercing,      _f_ The thin film of the yolk.    (28.) _Periodical decidence of Wool._--It is affirmed that the only  real difference between hair and wool is in the latter falling off  periodically; but the same change takes place in animals totally  covered with hair; in fact, almost every animal is subject to  moulting, or a periodical decidence of its protecting covering. The  fleece of the sheep has been proved in many instances not to be liable  to _annual_ changes of this description;--Lord Western having, among  others, shown that the wool of the merino may be retained at least  three years without the slightest disposition to separate.    The annual employment of shearing, to anticipate this falling off of  the wool, is now common in most parts of the world; yet some, as the  Icelanders and Kamtschadales, still retain the primeval custom of  _rowing_, or pulling off the fleece in a mass, about the end of May,  at which time it is nearly loosened. This loosening of the attachments  of the fibre is supposed to be owing to a diminution, during winter,  of the nutritive process at the root of the hair, so that the fibre is  liable to give way at the tender part when the fleece becomes heavy  during Spring. This attempt at an explanation meets, however, with the  insurmountable objection, that long-woolled are less liable than  short-woolled sheep to this occurrence, a circumstance which ought to  be the reverse, if weight had any thing to do in the case.    (29.) _Falling off of Wool prevented by Clipping._--Clipping has a  curious influence over the duration of the covering of animals, as is  well exemplified by the correct popular idea, that the only way to  prevent the hair of children dropping off (as it sometimes has a  tendency to do) is to cut it short: we may suppose the benefit in this  case to result from the removal of a _portion_ of each hair, which, if  allowed to remain, would lead to a sacrifice of the _whole_, by  robbing the root of a quantity of nutritious matter, which, owing to a  diminution of reproductive power, it could ill afford. In this way  only can we account for the power which shearing evinces, in putting a  stop to the attempt sometimes made by nature to change the coverings  of some sheep. In the valley which separates the most eastern chain of  the Cordilleras from the central, the wool grows upon the lambs in the  same manner as in temperate climates, provided they are sheared so  soon as it has arrived at a certain thickness; in which case the wool  grows again, preserving the same order. But, if the period for  denuding the animal be allowed to pass, the wool detaches itself in  flakes, leaving behind a short, glossy, and compact hair, exactly  resembling that of the common goat in the same climate.    (30.) _Form of woolly fibre._--The fibre of wool is circular,  differing in diameter in the various breeds, and different parts  of the same fleece. The following _a propos_ observations are  from the article on the Sheep, in the Library of Useful Knowledge:  \"The filaments of white wool, when cleansed from grease, are  semitransparent; their surface in some places is beautifully polished,  in others curiously encrusted, and they reflect the rays of light in a  very pleasing manner. When viewed by the aid of a powerful achromatic  microscope, the central part of the fibre has a singularly glittering  appearance. Very irregularly placed minuter filaments are sometimes  seen branching from the main trunk, like boughs from the principal  stem. This exterior polish varies much in different wools, and in  wools from the same breed of sheep at different times. When the animal  is in good condition, and the fleece healthy, the appearance of the  fibre is really brilliant; but, when the sheep has been half starved,  the wool seems to have sympathized with the state of the constitution,  and either a wan pale light, or sometimes scarcely any, is reflected.\"    The more transparent the filament the better is the fleece, and its  value is impaired by the transparency being different in the same  fleece, or, as often happens, in the same filament; while that which  possesses fineness with a close ground, pureness, elasticity, colour,  tenacity, and not much pitch-mark, is the most esteemed, and preferred  by the manufacturer. Wethers have considerably more wool than ewes. In  every fleece there are several qualities, even so many as nine  different sorts, which are all separated from each other in England by  men called woolstaplers, who are appointed for the purpose, and sworn  to do justice between the grower, and the merchant or manufacturer. In  this manner the latter obtains, without trouble or risk, the very kind  which he knows will suit his purpose; for though the sorter,  surrounded by a number of baskets, divides the wool according to its  properties without the slightest hesitation, and with a rapidity truly  surprising, yet such is the amount of the dexterity acquired by  practice, that a mistake seldom occurs, and his judgment can as rarely  be disputed.    (3"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#5)"],[1,"a regular attempt to inquire into their  folk-lore and customary laws, at my husband's station on the Narran,  due north of the Barwon River, the great affluent of the Murray River.    My tribe is a neighbour of that mentioned by Mr. Howitt as the  'Wollaroi,' 'Yualloroi,' or 'Yualaroi.' [Howitt, NATIVE TRIBES OF  SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA, pp. 57, 467, 694, 769.] I spell the tribal name  'Euahlayi'; the accent is on the second syllable--'You-ahl-ayi'; and  the name is derived from the tribal word for the negative: EUAHL, or  YOUAL, 'No,' as in the case of the Kamilaroi (Kamil, 'No'), and many  other tribes.    Mr. Howitt regards these tribes as on the limits of what he calls the  'Four Sub-Class' system. The people, that is to say, have not only the  division into two 'phratries,' or 'exogamous moieties,' intermarrying,  but also the four 'Matrimonial Classes' further regulating marriage.  These classes bear the Kamilaroi names, of unknown meaning, Ipai, Kumbo,  Murri, and Kubbi; but the names of the two main divisions, or phratries,  are not those of the Kamilaroi--DILBI and KUPATHIN.    The Euahlayi language, or dialect, is not identical with that of the  great Kamilaroi tribe to their south-east, but is clearly allied with  it, many names of animals being the same in both tongues. A few names  of animals are shared with the Wir djuri speech, as MULLIAN, Eagle  Hawk; Pelican, GOOLAYYAHLEE (Wir djuri, GULAIGULI). The term for the  being called 'The All Father' by Mr. Howitt is also the term used by  the Wir djuri and Kamilaroi, 'Baiame' or 'Byamee.' The Euahlayi,  however, possess myths, beliefs, and usages not recorded as extant  among the Kamilaroi, but rather forming a link with the ideas of  peoples dwelling much further west, such as the tribes, on Lake Eyre,  and the southernmost Arunta of the centre. Thus, there is a limited and  modified shape of the central and northern belief in reincarnation, and  there is a great development of what are called by Mr. Howitt  'sub-totems,' which have been found most in a region of Northern  Victoria, to the south of the Euahlayi. There is a belief in  spirit--haunted trees, as among the Arunta, and there is a form of the  Arunta myth of the 'Dream Time,' the age of pristine evolution.    The Euahlayi thus present a mixture of ideas and usages which appears  to be somewhat peculiar and deserving of closer study than it has  received. Mr. Howitt himself refers to the tribe very seldom. It will  be asked, 'How far have the Euahlayi been brought under the influence  of missionaries, and of European ideas in general?'    The nearest missionary settlement was founded after we settled among  the Euahlayi, and was distant about one hundred miles, at Brewarrina.  None of my native informants had been at any time, to my knowledge,  under the influence of missionaries. They all wore shirts, and almost  all of them trousers, on occasion; and all, except the old men, my  chief sources, were employed by white settlers. We conversed in a kind  of LINGUA FRANCA. An informant, say Peter, would try to express himself  in English, when he thought that I was not successful in following him  in his own tongue. With Paddy, who had no English but a curse, I used  two native women, one old, one younger, as interpreters, checking each  other alternately. The younger natives themselves had lost the sense of  some of the native words used by their elders, but the middle-aged  interpreters were usually adequate. Occasionally there were disputes on  linguistic points, when Paddy, a man already grey in 1845, would march  off the scene, and need to be reconciled. They were on very good terms  with me. They would exchange gifts with me: I might receive a carved  weapon, and one of them some tobacco. The giving was not all on my  side, by any means.    My anthropological reading was scanty, but I was well acquainted with  and believed in Mr. Herbert Spencer's 'Ghost theory' of the origin of  religion in the worship of ancestral spirits. What I learned from the  natives surprised me, and shook my faith in Mr. Spencer's theory, with  which it seemed incompatible.    In hearing the old blacks tell their legends you notice a great  difference between them as raconteurs--some tell the bare plot or  feature of the legend, others give descriptive touches all through. If  they are strangers to their audience, they get it over as quickly as  possible in a half-contemptuous way, as if saying, 'What do you want to  know such rubbish for?' But if they know you well, and know you really  are interested, then they tell you the stories as they would tell them  to one another, giving them a new life and adding considerably to their  poetical expression.          CHAPTER II    THE ALL FATHER, BYAMEE      As throughout the chapters on the customary laws, mysteries, and  legends of the Euahlayi, there occur frequent mentions of a superhuman  though anthropomorphic being named Byamee (in Kamilaroi and Wir djuri  'Baiame'), it is necessary to give a preliminary account of the beliefs  entertained concerning him. The name Byamee (usually spelled Baiame)  occurs in Euahlayi, Kamilaroi, and Wir djuri; 'the Wir djuri language  is spoken over a greater extent of territory than any other tongue in  New South Wales.'[R. H. Mathews, J. A. I., vol. xxxiv. p. 284.] The word  occurs in the Rev. Mr. Ridley's GURRE KAMILAROI, an illustrated manual of  Biblical instruction for the education of the Kamilaroi: Mr. Ridley  translated our 'God' by 'Baiame.' He supposed that native term, which he  found and did not introduce, to be a derivative from the verb BAIA, or  BIAI, 'to make.' Literally, however, at least in Euahlayi, the word BYAMEE  means 'great one.' In its sense as the name of the All Father it is not  supposed to be used by women or by the uninitiated. If it is necessary to  speak to them of Byamee, he is called Boyjerh, which means Father, just as  in the Theddora tribe the women speak of Darramulun as PAPANG, 'Father.'  [Howitt, Native Tribes of South-East Australia, p. 493.] Among the  Euahlayi both women and the uninitiated use byamee, the adjective for  'great,' in ordinary talk, though the more usual adjective answering to  'great' is BOOROOL, which occurs in Kamilaroi as well as in Euahlayi. The  verb baia or biai, to make or shape, whence Mr. Ridley derived Baiame, is  not known to me in Euahlayi. Wir djuri has BAI, a footmark, and Byamee  left footmarks on the rocks, but that is probably a chance coincidence.    I was first told of Byamee, in whispers, by a very old native, Yudtha  Dulleebah (Bald Head), said to have been already grey haired when Sir  Thomas Mitchell discovered the Narran in 1846. My informant said that  he was instructed as to Byamee in his first Boorah, or initiation. If  he was early grey, say at thirty, in 1846, that takes his initiation  back to 1830, when, as a matter of fact, we have contemporary evidence  to the belief in Byamee, who is not of missionary importation, though  after 1856 Christian ideas may, through Mr. Ridley's book, have been  attached to his name by educated Kamilaroi. But he was a worshipful  being, revealed in the mysteries, long before missionaries came, as all  my informants aver.    There has, indeed, been much dispute as to whether the Aborigines of  Australia have any idea, or germ of an idea, of a God; anything more  than vague beliefs about unattached spirits, mainly mischievous, who  might be propitiated or scared away. Mr. Huxley maintained this view,  as did Mr. Herbert Spencer. [ECCLESIASTICAL INSTITUTIONS, p. 674.] Both of  these authors, who have great influence on popular opinion, omitted to  notice the contradictory statement of Waitz, published in 1872. He  credited the natives, in some regions, with belief in, and dances  performed in honour of, a 'Good Being,' and denied that the belief and  rites were the result of European influence. [Waitz, ANTHROPOLOGIE DER  NATUR--V(tm)LKER, vol. vi. pp. 796-798. Leipzig, 1872.] Mr. Tylor,  admitting to some extent that the belief now exists, attributed it in part  to the influence of missionaries and of white settlers. [Journal,  Anthropological Institute, vol. xxi. p. 292 ET SEQ.] 'Baiame,' he held,  was a word of missionary manufacture, introduced about 1830-1840. This  opinion was controverted by Mr. Lang,[MAGIC AND RELIGION, p. 25 SQ. MYTH,  RITUAL, AND RELIGION, vol. ii. chap. xii., 1899.] and by Mr. N. W. Thomas.  Mr. Thomas [MAN, 1905, No. 28.] has produced the evidence of Henderson,  writing in 1829-1830, for the belief in 'Piame' or Byamee, or  Baiame. [OBSERVATIONS AN THE COLONIES OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND VAN DIEMAN'S  LAND, p. 147.]    In 1904 Mr. Howitt gave a great mass of evidence for the belief in what  he calls an 'All Father': in many dialects styled by various names  meaning 'Our Father,' dwelling in or above the sky, and often receiving  the souls of blacks who have been 'good.' These ideas are not derived,  Mr. Howitt holds, from Europeans, or developed out of ancestor-worship,  which does not exist in the tribes. The belief is concealed from women,  but communicated to lads at their initiation. [Howitt, NATIVE TRIBES OF  SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA, pp. 488-508.] The belief, in favourable  circumstances, might develop, Mr. Howitt thinks, into what he speaks of as  a 'religion,' a 'recognised religion.' Without asking how 'a recognised  religion' is to be defined, I shall merely tell what I have gathered as to  the belief in Byamee among the Euahlayi.    It may seem strange that I should know anything about a belief  carefully kept from women, but I have even been privileged to hear  'Byamee's Song,' which only the fully initiated may sing; an old black,  as will later appear, did chant this old lay, now no longer understood,  to myself and my husband. Moreover, the women of the Euahlayi have some  knowledge of, and some means of, mystic access to Byamee, though they  call him by another name."]]]
