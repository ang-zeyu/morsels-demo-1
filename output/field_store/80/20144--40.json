It was not a very comfortable  room--just big enough to allow the poor composer to turn about. It was  dimly lighted. It \"contained no stove, and the roof was in such bad  repair that the rain and the snow made unceremonious entry and drenched  the young artist in his bed. In winter the water in his jug froze so  hard during the night that he had to go and draw direct from the well.\"  For neighbours he had successively a journeyman printer, a footman and  a cook. These were not likely to respect his desire for quiet, but the  mere fact of his having a room all to himself made him oblivious of  external annoyances. As he expressed it, he was \"too happy to envy the  lot of kings.\" He had his old, worm-eaten spinet, and his health and his  good spirits; and although he was still poor and unknown, he was \"making  himself all the time,\" like Sir Walter Scott in Liddesdale.    An Early Composition    Needless to say, he was composing a great deal. Much of his manuscript  was, of course, torn up or consigned to the flames, but one piece  of work survived. This was his first Mass in F (No. 11 in Novello's  edition), erroneously dated by some writers 1742. It shows signs of  immaturity and inexperience, but when Haydn in his old age came upon the  long-forgotten score he was so far from being displeased with it that  he rearranged the music, inserting additional wind parts. One biographer  sees in this procedure \"a striking testimony to the genius of the lad  of eighteen.\" We need not read it in that way. It rather shows a natural  human tenderness for his first work, a weakness, some might call it,  but even so, more pardonable than the weakness--well illustrated by some  later instances--of hunting out early productions and publishing them  without a touch of revision.    Metastasio    It was presumably by mere chance that in that same rickety Michaelerhaus  there lived at this date not only the future composer of \"The Creation,\"  but the Scribe of the eighteenth century, the poet and opera librettist,  Metastasio. Born in 1698, the son of humble parents, this distinguished  writer had, like Haydn, suffered from \"the eternal want of pence.\" A  precocious boy, he had improvised verses and recited them on the street,  and fame came to him only after long and weary years of waiting. In 1729  he was appointed Court poet to the theatre at Vienna, for which he wrote  several of his best pieces, and when he made Haydn's acquaintance his  reputation was high throughout the whole of Europe. Naturally, he  did not live so near the clouds as Haydn--his rooms were on the third  story--but he heard somehow of the friendless, penniless youth in the  attic, and immediately resolved to do what he could to further his  interests. This, as events proved, was by no means inconsiderable.    A Noble Pupil    Metastasio had been entrusted with the education of Marianne von  Martinez, the daughter of a Spanish gentleman who was Master of  the Ceremonies to the Apostolic Nuncio. The young lady required a  musicmaster, and the poet engaged Haydn to teach her the harpsichord, in  return for which service he was to receive free board. Fraulein Martinez  became something of a musical celebrity. When she was only seventeen she  had a mass performed at St Michael's Church, Vienna. She was a favourite  of the Empress Maria Theresa, and is extolled by Burney--who speaks of  her \"marvelous accuracy\" in the writing of English--as a singer and a  player, almost as highly as Gluck's niece. Her name finds a place in the  biographies of Mozart, who, at her musical receptions, used to take part  with her in duets of her own composition. Several of her manuscripts are  still in the possession of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Something  of her musical distinction ought certainly to be attributed to Haydn,  who gave her daily lessons for three years, during which time he was  comfortably housed with the family.    Porpora    It was through Metastasio, too, that he was introduced to Niccolo  Porpora, the famous singing-master who taught the great Farinelli,  and whose name is sufficiently familiar from its connection with an  undertaking set on foot by Handel's enemies in London. Porpora seems  at this time to have ruled Vienna as a sort of musical director and  privileged censor, to have been, in fact, what Rossini was for many  years in Paris. He was giving lessons to the mistress of Correr, the  Venetian ambassador--a \"rare musical enthusiast\"--and he employed Haydn  to act as accompanist during the lessons.    Menial Duties    We get a curious insight into the social conditions of the musicians of  this time in the bearing of Haydn towards Porpora and his pupil. That  Haydn should become the instructor of Fraulein Martinez in no way  compromised his dignity; nor can any reasonable objection be raised  against his filling the post of, accompanist to the ambassador's  mistress. But what shall be said of his being transported to the  ambassador's summer quarters at Mannersdorf, and doing duty there for  six ducats a month and his board--at the servants' table? The reverend  author of Music and Morals answers by reminding us that in those days  musicians were not the confidential advisers of kings like Wagner, rich  banker's sons like Meyerbeer, private gentlemen like Mendelssohn, and  members of the Imperial Parliament like Verdi. They were \"poor devils\"  like Haydn. Porpora was a great man, no doubt, in his own metier. But it  is surely odd to hear of Haydn acting the part of very humble servant  to the singing-master; blackening his boots and trimming his wig,  and brushing his coat, and running his errands, and playing his  accompaniments! Let us, however, remember Haydn's position and  circumstances. He was a poor man. He had never received any regular  tuition such as Handel received from Zachau, Mozart from his father, and  Mendelssohn from Zelter. He had to pick up his instruction as he went  along; and if he felt constrained to play the lackey to Porpora, it was  only with the object of receiving in return something which would help  to fit him for his profession. As he naively said, \"I improved greatly  in singing, composition, and Italian.\" [The relations of Haydn and  Porpora are sketched in George Sand's \"Consuelo.\"]    Emanuel Bach    In the meantime he was carrying on his private studies with the greatest  assiduity. His Fux and his Mattheson had served their turn, and he  had now supplemented them by the first six Clavier Sonatas of Philipp  Emanuel Bach, the third son of the great composer. The choice may seem  curious when we remember that Haydn had at his hand all the music of  Handel and Bach, and the masters of the old contrapuntal school. But it  was wisely made. The simple, well-balanced form of Emanuel Bach's works  \"acted as well as a master's guidance upon him, and led him to the first  steps in that style of writing which was afterwards one of his greatest  glories.\" The point is admirably put by Sir Hubert Parry. He says, in  effect, that what Haydn had to build upon, and what was most congenial  to him, through his origin and circumstances, was the popular songs and  dances of his native land, which, in the matter of structure, belong to  the same order of art as symphonies and sonatas; and how this kind of  music could be made on a grander scale was what he wanted to discover.  The music of Handel and Bach leaned too much towards the style of the  choral music and organ music of the church to serve him as a model. For  their art was essentially contrapuntal--the combination of several parts  each of equal importance with the rest, each in a sense pursuing its own  course. In modern music the essential principle is harmonic: the  chords formed by the combination of parts are derived and developed in  reference to roots and keys. In national dances few harmonies are used,  but they are arranged on the same principles as the harmonies of a  sonata or a symphony; and \"what had to be found out in order to make  grand instrumental works was how to arrange more harmonies with the same  effect of unity as is obtained on a small scale in dances and national  songs.\" Haydn, whose music contains many reminiscences of popular  folk-song, had in him the instinct for this kind of art; and the study  of Philipp Emanuel's works taught him how to direct his energies in the  way that was most agreeable to him.    A Disciple of Emanuel Bach    Although much has been written about Emanuel Bach, it is probable that  the full extent of his genius remains yet to be recognized. He was the  greatest clavier player, teacher and accompanist of his day; a master  of form, and the pioneer of a style which was a complete departure from  that of his father. Haydn's enthusiasm for him can easily be explained.  \"I did not leave the clavier till I had mastered all his six sonatas,\"  he says, \"and those who know me well must be aware that I owe very much  to Emanuel Bach, whose works I understand and have thoroughly studied.  Emanuel Bach himself once complimented me on this fact.\" When Haydn  began to make a name Bach hailed him with delight as a disciple,  and took occasion to send him word that, \"he alone had thoroughly  comprehended his works and made a proper use of them.\"    This is a sufficient answer to the absurd statement which has been made,  and is still sometimes repeated, that Bach was jealous of the young  composer and abused him to his friends. A writer in the European  Magazine for October 1784, says that Bach was \"amongst the number of  professors who wrote against our rising author.\" He mentions others as  doing the same thing, and then continues: \"The only notice Haydn took of  their scurrility and abuse was to publish lessons written in imitation  of the several styles of his enemies, in which their peculiarities were  so closely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37901"],[0,"Profitable Squab Breeding (#5)"],[1,"salt through the bag.      CHARCOAL    Charcoal keeps the birds in good condition and a cigar box full of  charcoal, broken into bits about the size of wheat grains, should  constantly be kept before the birds. This crushed charcoal is to be  found in poultry supply stores. If none of these are within reach, the  pigeon-breeder may make his own charcoal by burning wood to a coal and  then extinguishing the fire with water. Corn cobs, charred in this way,  make an excellent charcoal for pigeons.      [Illustration: Swiss Mondaine. Very large but usually slow workers.]      HOW TO FEED    It is usually best to feed pigeons by hand. They should be fed twice  every day. In summer, feed at 7:30 a. m., and at winter 4:30 p. m. In  winter, feed an hour later in the morning and an hour earlier in the  evening. Of course, these hours may be varied but the feeding should be  done at the same hour every day, morning and evening, as the birds soon  become accustomed to the feeding hours and if not fed on time become  very restless. Many successful breeders feed their birds in hoppers  thereby greatly reducing the labor of feeding. This method is successful  unless the birds get to picking out only certain grains and then more or  less trouble will be met. It is always necessary to construct hoppers in  such form that the birds cannot get into them and foul the grain, but  this is a very simple matter as shown by the illustration on next page.  Mixed grains sufficient for several days feeding may be placed in these  hoppers and the birds will eat only what they need for each meal.      FEED TROUGHS    Feed troughs should be ten inches wide, six feet long and three inches  deep. These are easily made and are much better than any of the  automatic hoppers on the market. Where the feed is given in hoppers the  birds will eat the kind they like best and waste much of the rest of the  feed.      MIXTURES RECOMMENDED    For the morning mix equal parts of wheat, cracked corn and Canada peas.  Give three quarts of this mixture to each fifty pairs of birds. For the  evening feed kaffir corn, cracked corn, millet and Canada peas, equal  parts. Give three quarts to each fifty pairs of birds.    Every third day, substitute hemp seed for millet, or feed a little less  of the regular ration and throw a handful or two of hemp seed on the  floor as recommended above. If broken rice can be bought cheaply a small  feed of this may be substituted for one of the feeds of hemp seed each  week. Peanuts may be substituted for Canada peas wherever it will mean a  saving in cost.      ALWAYS FEED INDOORS    Never feed pigeons out of doors, as any feed left over is likely to be  damaged by the weather; and in bad weather they must be fed indoors, so  it is best to feed them indoors at all times.      [Illustration: Fig. 9. Showing Construction of Feeding Hoppers.      Fig. A shows end construction of the double hopper from which the    birds may feed at both sides and Fig. B shows construction of the    single hopper. The style illustrated may be made in a few minutes    from an old box and will hold about four bushels of grain. This    method of feeding saves a great amount of time and labor.]      ECONOMICAL FEEDING    The pigeon breeder should always feed his birds, so that he will know it  is properly done. If at any time any of the grain from a previous feed  is left in the troughs, the ration should be reduced a little. If the  troughs are emptied in a way that shows the birds have not plenty to  eat, add a little to the quantity given them.    Pigeons which are feeding squabs require more feed than those not  working, as they must eat enough for the squabs and for themselves also.    Squabs are fed by the parents in a most peculiar way. The old birds,  male and female, eat the grain and drink water freely. This is partially  digested until it is formed into a milky liquid mass. Then the squab  puts its beak inside that of the parent bird and the parent by a  peculiar jerking motion of the head and neck \"pumps\" this liquid food  into the crop of the young bird. This feed is called \"pigeon's milk\" and  is very nutritious, young squabs growing more rapidly than any other  kind of young birds.      BREEDING HABITS    The breeding habits of pigeons are peculiar. When a male has selected  the female he desires for his mate, there follows a course of true  love-making in which the male struts around his favorite, coos to her  and evidently tries to show her what a grand bird he is. The female, if  attracted by her wooer, becomes friendly with him and the two \"bill\"  each other very much as if they were exchanging kisses.    The two then select a nesting place and build a nest therein and the  cock bird becomes very anxious for the hen to begin laying. If she does  not promptly attend to her duties, he will drive her about the loft,  talking angrily to her and striking her with his wings.    Finally the hen takes to her nest and deposits an egg. Then she misses a  day and deposits a second egg, this usually being all that are laid at  one time.    As soon as the first egg is laid, brooding begins. The hen occupies the  nest from about four in the afternoon until ten the next forenoon. The  cock then sits while his mate eats and rests. In this order the brooding  goes on and at the end of about seventeen days the first laid egg  hatches, and in due course the last one hatches if no accidents have  happened to it.    In this way it happens that one of the young birds is two days older  than the other and almost invariably the first hatched is a male, the  latter one being a female.    The old birds now begin to feed the young, and they grow marvelously.  They are kept stuffed full of \"pigeon milk\" and on this they seem to  grow while one watches them.    In a few days the hen is ready to lay again, and if there is a spare  nest box the pair makes another nest and the hen lays two eggs, after  which the couple are kept very busy brooding one pair of eggs and at the  same time feeding a pair of rapidly growing squabs.    When the squabs are about four weeks old they are heavier than they ever  will be again in their lives, as they have reached full size and are  very fat. It is at this time that they are taken from the nest and sent  to the market.    If not taken from the nest about this time, the old birds, desiring to  start with another pair of eggs, turn the squabs out and they fall on  the floor of the loft so fat they can hardly get about. Here they become  lean while learning to eat for themselves, and soon become sleek and  trim, instead of being unwieldy with fat.    This doubling up with families shows the necessity of providing at least  two nest boxes for each pair of pigeons in a loft. It is even better to  have more than two nests for each pair, as this gives them some liberty  of choice and often saves quarreling between two couples.    As pigeons mate for life, it is very important that only mated and  married pairs are kept together. If an odd cock or an odd hen is left in  a loft, there are family troubles without end; and the quarrels which  arise from this cause result in broken eggs and squabs killed in the  fights.    It sometimes happens that a pair will not produce young. This is usually  because the hen is barren. In such a case the hen should be disposed of  and a new mate for the cock furnished. It is best to shut the two in a  box with a wire partition between the two until they become acquainted  with each other, after which they will usually mate, although they do  not invariably do so.      DETERMINING THE SEX.    It is very difficult to determine the sex of pigeons without watching  them at work in the fly. Various breeders have methods by which they are  sometimes able to distinguish the male from the female but at best,  these methods are only a guess and the only safe way is to place the  birds in a mating coop or in a fly with others and watch them carefully.    As a rule the bones at the vent of a female are wider apart and softer  than those of a male, especially in older birds that have laid and  hatched young. Sometimes the sex may be determined by an examination of  the tail feathers, those of the male being worn on the under side at the  ends from throwing the tail down against the ground or the roof of the  loft when strutting. Others hold the bird by the beak in one hand and  the feet in the other and then when the bird is stretched out, the male  will usually hold the tail close to the body, while the female will  throw her tail out. These signs are only indications of the sex and even  the most experienced breeder will often be badly fooled in handling  unmated birds. The best and safest way is to watch the birds, as stated  above, and it will quickly be noted that the male is livelier than the  female and is usually cooing and strutting about her and will turn  entirely around in his flirting while the female seldom turns more than  half way around.      [Illustration: Fig. 10. Showing the Construction of a Practical and    Convenient Fly.]          CHAPTER V    INCREASING THE FLOCK--SELECTING FUTURE BREEDERS BANDING--MATING      Almost everyone who raises squabs finds that he must constantly increase  the number of breeding pigeons in his lofts in order to keep pace with  the increasing demand for squabs.    The most economical way to increase a flock is to save the best squabs  from the first breeding stock bought; and to do this it is necessary to  select squabs for this purpose as they are hatched, the object being to  improve the quality of the flock by keeping only the best of the squabs.    Where a flock is being increased, it is a good plan to buy some new  stock which has been banded and mate the cocks which have been bought  with home-raised hens and the hens which have been bought with some  home-raised cocks. This saves inbreeding.    Close inbreeding soon runs down the vitality of a"]]]
