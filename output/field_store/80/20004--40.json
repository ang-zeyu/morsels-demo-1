And she must have caught you in  the act.\"    Though that was exactly what had happened, Miss Kitty Cat wouldn't say a  word. But she _looked_ whole sentences at him.    Soon Farmer Green's wife came to the door again and called, \"Come, Spot!  Come, Spot!\"    He hurried up to her and caught the piece of meat that she tossed to  him.    It was mutton.          XIII    HUNTING      To please old dog Spot Johnnie Green had only to ask him this question,  \"Want to go hunting, Spot?\"    When he heard that, Spot would leave anything he happened to be doing,  or give up anything he had intended to do. Perhaps he had expected to  dig up and gnaw a choice bone that he had buried somewhere. It might be  that he had been planning to chase the cat, or tease Turkey Proudfoot in  order to hear him gobble. There wasn't one of those pleasures that Spot  wouldn't gladly forgo for the sake of going hunting with Johnnie Green.    When Johnnie Green's father first gave him a shotgun Spot went almost  frantic with delight. And they lost no time in starting for the woods.  Johnnie Green trudged up the lane with the gun on his shoulder, while  Spot ran on ahead of him, returning now and then as if to urge Johnnie  to hurry.    They hadn't been long in the woods when Spot suddenly stood still and  pointed ahead of him with his nose.    Try as he would, Johnnie couldn't see what Spot was pointing at. So he  took a few steps forward until he came abreast of the old dog. Then all  at once there was a rumbling _whir_ that sounded to Johnnie Green almost  as loud as thunder. A brownish streak flashed from the ground just ahead  of him.    He knew that it was a grouse rising. And he fired.    Johnnie Green missed the bird. It had given him such a start that he was  still shaking long afterward. He was disappointed, but not less downcast  than old Spot.    \"Never mind, old boy!\" Johnnie said. \"We'll have better luck next time!\"    But they didn't. Twice more that same thing happened. And after the  third miss old Sport turned tail and ran away.    \"I don't see what's the matter with that boy,\" he muttered. \"I've  pointed three birds for him. And he has let every one of them get  away.... There's no fun in that kind of shooting.\"    After that Johnnie couldn't get Spot to go into the woods with him.  Whenever Johnnie appeared in the yard with his gun, Spot promptly  vanished.    So Johnnie spent a good deal of time shooting at old tin cans which he  set on a fence post or a stone wall. And it wasn't long before he found  he could hit them at every shot.    At last he came home from the woods one day with a grouse. When he  showed it to Spot the old dog actually began teasing him to go hunting.    The next day they set out together for the woods. And Johnnie knocked  down the very first grouse that Spot found for him.    Spot brought the bird to Johnnie and laid it proudly at his feet.    \"Did Johnnie Green ever give you any of the birds that you find for  him?\" Miss Kitty Cat inquired when Spot was boasting a bit about the  sport he and Johnnie had in the woods. \"No!\" she said, answering her own  question. \"You're silly to hunt for him. I prefer to do my hunting  alone. Then nobody can take the game away from me.\"    Old dog Spot walked away from her, to the barn.    \"Miss Kitty Cat doesn't know what real hunting is,\" he told the old  horse Ebenezer. \"She creeps up on small birds after dark, when they are  asleep.\"    \"And you creep up on big birds in the daytime,\" said old Ebenezer, \"so  Johnnie Green can shoot them.\"    Being a sporting dog, Spot couldn't see anything queer in that remark.    \"Certainly!\" he said.          XIV    MISSING HIS MASTER      Johnnie Green went visiting one summer, after haying was done. Much to  old dog Spot's disgust, Johnnie did not take him on this journey. But it  was not Spot's fault that he was left at home. Had he not been shut up  in the harness room in the barn when Johnnie drove the old horse  Ebenezer out of the yard Spot would have followed beneath the buggy.    It was hours before Farmer Green set Spot free. When Farmer Green at  last flung open the door of the harness room Spot rushed out and dashed  into the road. To his sorrow he couldn't smell a trace of Ebenezer's  track. So many other horses had passed by the house since morning that  Spot couldn't even tell which way Ebenezer had gone.    In desperation Spot ran up the road a little way. Then he turned around  and ran down the hill as far as the gristmill.    By the time he reached the mill pond Spot gave up the chase. He knew it  was hopeless.    And seeing several of Johnnie Green's friends swimming in the pond, he  joined them.    The boys welcomed him with shouts. And the water was just as cool as  ever. But somehow Spot didn't find swimming as pleasant as he always had  before. He missed Johnnie Green. There wasn't another boy there that  gave Spot the same thrill by whistling to him, or patting him, or  romping with him that Johnnie Green gave him.    After a while Spot shook himself and trotted back to Farmer Green's  place. He felt homesick. But when he reached the house somehow he felt  worse than ever. It was terribly quiet. It was just like a Sunday  morning, when everybody was at church. Farmer Green and the hired man  were working in the fields. Mrs. Green was busy in the house--too busy  to stop and talk with old Spot.    \"It's frightfully dull here,\" Spot groaned. \"I wish somebody would  shout.\" And just to break the silence he lifted up his nose and tried to  bark.    It was far from a cheerful noise that he made, for he only succeeded in  giving a mournful howl. And that sad sound made Spot gloomier than ever.    \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's nothing else to do, so I'll go and dig up  that bone that I buried in the orchard last week.\"    He found the bone where he had hidden it. Yet it did not look half as  inviting as it had when he covered it with dirt a few days before. He  stared at it dully. Then he put it back in its hole and pawed the dirt  over it again.    He found no pleasure in anything. No longer was there any fun in chasing  woodchucks. The cows might have stayed in the cornfield all day long and  Spot wouldn't have bothered them. He didn't even get any sport out of  teasing Miss Kitty Cat.    Strangest of all, he couldn't find any comfort in lying down for a quiet  nap. The moment he tried to pass the time away in that fashion he began  to think about Johnnie Green and what a nice boy he was. And then he  would get up and walk around and around the house. Hour after hour Spot  spent in that fashion.    It wasn't many days before he had worn a path in the grass all the way  around the farmhouse. When Farmer Green noticed it he didn't scold Spot.  He patted his head and said, \"Cheer up, old boy! Johnnie'll be back one  of these days.\"    Old dog Spot wagged his tail feebly. But it was hard to wait.    \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" he said to himself, \"if there was only somebody  to play with. If there was a puppy here on the farm I'd have some one  that would be ready to romp whenever I felt like it. And then Johnnie  could go away visiting every summer and I wouldn't miss him half as  much.\"    Spot forgot that a puppy wouldn't stay a puppy forever.          XV    A BASKETFUL OF FUN      Johnnie Green came home from his visit at last. The moment Spot heard  the old horse Ebenezer come jogging up the road he tore out of the yard  and ran, barking, to meet the travellers. He frisked about the buggy, he  sprang up and touched Ebenezer's nose with his own, he tried to jump  into the buggy beside Johnnie Green.    Spot made such a racket that everybody in the farmhouse knew that  Johnnie had returned. The family were just sitting down for dinner. And  they all hurried out into the yard. For old dog Spot was not the only  one that had missed Johnnie while he was away on his visit.    Johnnie leaped out of the buggy, to be met by a smother of pawings and  nosings from old Spot.    \"Now, Spot--you behave!\" said Johnnie Green. \"I'm hungry and I want to  get my dinner.\"    Spot paid not the slightest heed to his young master's objections.  \"You'll never know how I've missed you,\" he barked. \"And if I want to  romp with you for a few minutes, I'm going to; and nobody can stop me.\"    After a little Spot grew a bit calmer. He let Johnnie Green turn to the  buggy and lift out a covered basket.    Spot promptly stuck his nose against it. Then he drew back quickly.    \"Wow!\" he exclaimed. \"This basket smells _doggy!_\"    Spot followed Johnnie into the house. And in the woodshed Johnnie opened  the basket and brought out of it a soft, silky, blinking--puppy!    \"Wow!\" said Spot again. \"It was no wonder that I noticed a doggy smell  about that basket.\" And then he said, \"G-r-r-r!\"    Yes! Spot actually growled at the little newcomer. For the moment he  forgot that he had been wishing, for days, that there was a puppy about  the place. To tell the truth, he couldn't help feeling the least bit  jealous of Johnnie Green's new pet.    In a day or two, however, old Spot liked the puppy as much as anybody  else did. He proved to be a playful little chap. And the older he grew  the more fun-loving he became.    [Illustration: Sometimes the Puppy Would Bite Spot's Tail.    (_Page 73_)]    There were no more dull days for old dog Spot. When school opened in  the fall he no longer moped around the farmhouse, waiting for Johnnie to  come home. The puppy kept him too busy to notice Johnnie's absence.    At first Spot found it very pleasant to roll on the ground with his  small friend, and pretend to bite him, and upset him off his somewhat  wobbly legs. But as time passed Spot began to weary of never-ending  play. There were moments when Spot wanted to lie still and doze. But as  soon as he had settled himself for a nap the puppy was sure to come  bouncing up and sprawl all over him.

Or maybe you would  rather see me sitting on a stump, gazing down into the clear pool which  looks like a mirror.    \"Oh, what a vain bird!\" you would say; \"see him looking at himself in  the water;\" when all the time I had my eye on a fine trout which I  intended to catch for my dinner.    Well, though I wear a brighter dress than my American cousin, our habits  are pretty much alike. I am sure he catches fish the same way I do--when  he is hungry.    With a hook and line, as you do?    Oh, no; with my bill, which is long, you observe, and made for that very  purpose. You should just see me catch a fish! Down I fly to a stump near  the brook, or to a limb of a tree which overhangs the water, and there I  sit as quiet as a mouse for quite a while.    Everything being so quiet, a fine speckled trout, or a school of  troutlets, play near the surface. Now is my chance! Down I swoop, and  up I come with a fish crosswise in my bill.    Back I go to my perch, toss the minnow into the air, and as it falls  catch it head first and swallow it whole. I tell you this because you  ought to know why I am called _Kingfisher_.    Do we swallow bones and all?    Yes, but we afterwards eject the bones, when we are resting or roosting  in our holes in the banks of the stream. That must be the reason people  who write about us say we build our nests of fish bones.    Sing?    Oh, no, we are not singing birds; but sometimes, when flying swiftly  through the air, we give a harsh cry that nobody but a bird understands.                                                Your friend,                                         THE ENGLISH KINGFISHER.          THE VERMILION FLY-CATCHER.      Thickets along water courses are favorite resorts of this beautiful  Fly-catcher, which may be seen only on the southern border of the United  States, south through Mexico to Guatemala, where it is a common species.  Mr. W. E. D. Scott notes it as a common species about Riverside, Tucson,  and Florence, Arizona. Its habits are quite similar to those of other  Fly-catchers, though it has not been so carefully observed as its many  cousins in other parts of the country. During the nesting season, the  male frequently utters a twittering song while poised in the air, in the  manner of the Sparrow Hawk, and during the song it snaps its bill as if  catching insects.    The Vermilion's nest is usually placed in horizontal forks of ratana  trees, and often in mesquites, not more than six feet from the ground;  they are composed of small twigs and soft materials felted together,  with the rims covered with lichens, and the shallow cavity lined with a  few horse or cow hairs. Dr. Merrill states that they bear considerable  resemblance to nests of the Wood Pewee in appearance and the manner in  which they are saddled to the limb. Nests have been found, however,  which lacked the exterior coating of lichens.    Three eggs are laid of a rich creamy-white with a ring of large brown  and lilac blotches at the larger end.          A WINTER NEST.          Pallid, wan-faced clouds      Press close to the frozen pines,      And follow the jagged lines      Of fence, that the sleet enshrouds.        Sharp in the face of the sky,      Gaunt, thin-ribbed leaves are blown;      They rise with a shuddering moan,      Then sink in the snow and die.        At the edge of the wood a vine      Still clings to the sleeping beech,      While its stiffened tendrils reach      A nest, and around it twine.        A little gray nest all alone,      With its feathery lining of snow,      Where bleak winds, piping low,      Croon a sweet minor tone.                      --NORA A. PIPER.

Red and yellow, green and brown,        Leaves are whirling, rustling down;      Acorn babes in their cradles lie,        Through the bare trees the brown birds fly;      The Robin chirps as he flutters past--        November days have come at last.                                 --CLARA LOUISE STRONG.      \"I have watched birds at their singing under many and widely differing  circumstances, and I am sure that they express joyous anticipation,  present content, and pleasant recollection, each as the mood moves, and  with equal ease.\"                     --M. THOMPSON.      \"The act of singing is evidently a pleasurable one; and it probably  serves as an outlet for superabundant nervous energy and excitement,  just as dancing, singing, and field sports do with us.\"                     --A. R. WALLACE.      \"The bird upon the tree utters the meaning of the wind--a voice of the  grass and wild flower, words of the green leaf; they speak through that  slender tone. Sweetness of dew and rifts of sunshine, the dark hawthorn  touched with breadths of open bud, the odor of the air, the color of the  daffodil--all that is delicious and beloved of spring-time are expressed  in his song.\"                     --RICHARD JEFFERIES.          THE LAZULI BUNTING.        The joy is great of him who strays      In shady woods on summer days.                         --MAURICE THOMPSON.      In Colorado and Arizona the Lazuli Painted Finch, as it is called,  is common, while in California it is very abundant, being, in fact,  generally distributed throughout the west, and along the Pacific Coast  it is found as far north as Puget Sound, during the summer. Davie says  it replaces the Indigo Bunting, (See BIRDS, Vol. I, page 174,) from the  Plains to the Pacific, being found in all suitable localities. The nest  is usually built in a bush or in the lower limbs of trees, a few feet  from the ground. Fine strips of bark, small twigs, grasses, and hair are  used in preparing it for the four tiny, light bluish-green eggs, which  readily fade when exposed to light. The eggs so closely resemble those  of the Bluebird as not to be distinguishable with certainty. The nest is  an inartistic one for a bird of gay plumage.    From Florence A. Merriam's charming book, \"A-Birding on a Bronco,\" we  select a description of the pretty manners of this attractive bird. She  says:    \"While waiting for the Woodpeckers, one day, I saw a small brownish  bird flying busily back and forth to some green weeds. She was joined  by her mate, a handsome blue Lazuli Bunting, even more beautiful than our  lovely Indigo, and he flew beside her full of life and joy. He lit on  the side of a cockle stem, and on the instant caught sight of me. Alas!  he seemed suddenly turned to stone. He held onto that stalk as if his  little legs had been bars of iron and I a devouring monster. When he had  collected his wits enough to fly off, instead of the careless gay flight  with which he had come out through the open air, he timidly kept low  within the cockle field, making a circuitous way through the high  stalks. He could be afraid of me if he liked, I thought, for after a  certain amount of suspicion, an innocent person gets resentful; at any  rate I was going to see that nest. Creeping up cautiously when the  mother bird was away, so as not to scare her, and carefully parting the  mallows, I looked in. Yes, there it was, a beautiful little sage-green  nest of old grass laid in a coil. I felt as pleased as if having a right  to share the family happiness. After that I watched the small worker  gather material with new interest, knowing where she was going to put  it. She worked fast, but did not take the first thing she found, by any  means. With a flit of the wing she went in nervous haste from cockle to  cockle, looking eagerly about her. Jumping down to the ground, she  picked up a bit of grass, threw it down dissatisfied, and turned away  like a person looking for something. At last she lit on the side of a  thistle, and tweaking out a fibre, flew with it to the nest.    \"A month after the first encounter with the father Lazuli, I found  him looking at me around the corner of a cockle stalk, and in passing  back again, caught him singing full tilt, though his bill was full of  insects! After we had turned our backs I looked over my shoulder and  had the satisfaction of seeing him take his beakful to the nest. You  couldn't help admiring him, for though not a warrior who would snap his  bill over the head of an enemy of his home, he had a gallant holiday air  with his blue coat and merry song, and you felt sure his little brown  mate would get cheer and courage enough from his presence to make family  dangers appear less frightful.\"           [Illustration: From col. John F. Ferry.                  LAZULI BUNTING.                  Copyrighted by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE LAZULI BUNTING.      You think you have seen me before? Well, I must admit my relative, the  Indigo Bunting, and I _do_ look alike. They say though, I am the  prettier bird of the two. Turn to your May number, page 174, and  decide for yourselves.    I live farther west than he does. You find him in the eastern and middle  states. Then he disappears and I take his place, all the way from the  Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean.    Some people call me the Lazuli Painted Finch. That's funny, for I never  painted anything in my life--not even my cheeks. Would you like to know  how my mate and I go to housekeeping? A lady who visits California,  where I live, will tell you all about it. She rides a horse called  Mountain Billy. He will stand still under a tree so that she can peep  into nests and count the eggs, when the mother bird is away.    She can travel a good many miles in that way, and meet lots of birds.  She says in her book, that she has got acquainted with seventy-five  families, without robbing one nest, or doing the little creatures any  harm.
