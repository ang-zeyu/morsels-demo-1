All the charm  of the piece is in its details, in a turn of peculiar lightness and  grace given to the situations and traits of sentiment, especially in  its quaint fragments of early French prose.    All through it one feels the influence of that faint air of  overwrought delicacy, almost of wantonness, which was so  strong a characteristic of the poetry of the Troubadours.  The  Troubadours themselves were often men of great rank; they  wrote for an exclusive audience, people of much leisure and great  refinement, and they came to value a type of personal beauty  which has in it but little of the influence of the open air and  sunshine.  There is a languid Eastern deliciousness in the very  scenery of the story, the full-blown roses, the chamber painted in  some mysterious manner where Nicolette is imprisoned, the cool  brown marble, the almost nameless colours, the odour of plucked  grass and flowers.  Nicolette herself well becomes this scenery,  and is the best illustration of the quality I mean--the beautiful,  weird, foreign girl, whom the [21] shepherds take for a fay, who  has the knowledge of simples, the healing and beautifying  qualities of leaves and flowers, whose skilful touch heals  Aucassin's sprained shoulder, so that he suddenly leaps from the  ground; the mere sight of whose white flesh, as she passed the  place where he lay, healed a pilgrim stricken with sore disease, so  that he rose up, and returned to his own country.  With this girl  Aucassin is so deeply in love that he forgets all knightly duties.  At last Nicolette is shut up to get her out of his way, and perhaps  the prettiest passage in the whole piece is the fragment of prose  which describes her escape:--    \"Aucassin was put in prison, as you have heard, and Nicolette  remained shut up in her chamber.  It was summer-time, in the  month of May, when the days are warm and long and clear, and  the nights coy and serene.    \"One night Nicolette, lying on her bed, saw the moon shine clear  through the little window, and heard the nightingale sing in the  garden, and then came the memory of Aucassin, whom she so  much loved.  She thought of the Count Garins of Beaucaire, who  mortally hated her, and, to be rid of her, might at any moment  cause her to be burned or drowned.  She perceived that the old  woman who kept her company was asleep; she rose and put on  the fairest gown she had; she took the bed-clothes [22] and the  towels, and knotted them together like a cord, as far as they  would go.  Then she tied the end to a pillar of the window, and let  herself slip down quite softly into the garden, and passed straight  across it, to reach the town.    \"Her hair was yellow in small curls, her smiling eyes blue-green,  her face clear and feat, the little lips very red, the teeth small and  white; and the daisies which she crushed in passing, holding her  skirt high behind and before, looked dark against her feet; the girl  was so white!    \"She came to the garden-gate and opened it, and walked through  the streets of Beaucaire, keeping on the dark side of the way to be  out of the light of the moon, which shone quietly in the sky.  She  walked as fast as she could, until she came to the tower where  Aucassin was.  The tower was set about with pillars, here and  there.  She pressed herself against one of the pillars, wrapped  herself closely in her mantle, and putting her face to a chink of  the tower, which was old and ruined, she heard Aucassin crying  bitterly within, and when she had listened awhile she began to  speak.\"    But scattered up and down through this lighter matter, always  tinged with humour and often passing into burlesque, which  makes up the general substance of the piece, there are morsels of  a different quality, touches of some intenser sentiment, coming it  would seem from [23] the profound and energetic spirit of the  Provençal poetry itself, to which the inspiration of the book has  been referred.  Let me gather up these morsels of deeper colour,  these expressions of the ideal intensity of love, the motive which  really unites together the fragments of the little composition.  Dante, the perfect flower of ideal love, has recorded how the  tyranny of that \"Lord of terrible aspect\" became actually  physical, blinding his senses, and suspending his bodily forces.  In this, Dante is but the central expression and type of  experiences known well enough to the initiated, in that passionate  age.  Aucassin represents this ideal intensity of passion--         Aucassin, le biax, li blons,       Li gentix, li amorous;--    the slim, tall, debonair, dansellon, as the singers call him, with  his curled yellow hair, and eyes of vair, who faints with love, as  Dante fainted, who rides all day through the forest in search of  Nicolette, while the thorns tear his flesh, so that one might have  traced him by the blood upon the grass, and who weeps at  eventide because he has not found her, who has the malady of his  love, and neglects all knightly duties.  Once he is induced to put  himself at the head of his people, that they, seeing him before  them, might have more heart to defend themselves; then a song  relates how the sweet, grave figure goes forth to battle, in dainty,  tight-laced [24] armour.  It is the very image of the Provençal  love-god, no longer a child, but grown to pensive youth, as Pierre  Vidal met him, riding on a white horse, fair as the morning, his  vestment embroidered with flowers.  He rode on through the  gates into the open plain beyond.  But as he went, that great  malady of his love came upon him.  The bridle fell from his  hands; and like one who sleeps walking, he was carried on into  the midst of his enemies, and heard them talking together how  they might most conveniently kill him.    One of the strongest characteristics of that outbreak of the reason  and the imagination, of that assertion of the liberty of the heart, in  the middle age, which I have termed a medieval Renaissance,  was its antinomianism, its spirit of rebellion and revolt against  the moral and religious ideas of the time.  In their search after the  pleasures of the senses and the imagination, in their care for  beauty, in their worship of the body, people were impelled  beyond the bounds of the Christian ideal; and their love became  sometimes a strange idolatry, a strange rival religion.  It was the  return of that ancient Venus, not dead, but only hidden for a time  in the caves of the Venusberg, of those old pagan gods still going  to and fro on the earth, under all sorts of disguises.  And this  element in the middle age, for the most part ignored by those  writers who have treated it pre-eminently as the [25] \"Age of  Faith\"--this rebellious and antinomian element, the recognition of  which has made the delineation of the middle age by the writers  of the Romantic school in France, by Victor Hugo for instance in  Notre-Dame de Paris, so suggestive and exciting--is found alike  in the history of Abelard and the legend of Tannhäuser.  More  and more, as we come to mark changes and distinctions of temper  in what is often in one all-embracing confusion called the middle  age, that rebellion, that sinister claim for liberty of heart and  thought, comes to the surface.  The Albigensian movement,  connected so strangely with the history of Provençal poetry, is  deeply tinged with it.  A touch of it makes the Franciscan order,  with its poetry, its mysticism, its \"illumination,\" from the point of  view of religious authority, justly suspect.  It influences the  thoughts of those obscure prophetical writers, like Joachim of  Flora, strange dreamers in a world of flowery rhetoric of that  third and final dispensation of a \"spirit of freedom,\" in which law  shall have passed away.  Of this spirit Aucassin and Nicolette  contains perhaps the most famous expression: it is the answer  Aucassin gives when he is threatened with the pains of hell, if he  makes Nicolette his mistress.  A creature wholly of affection and  the senses, he sees on the way to paradise only a feeble and worn-  out company of aged priests, \"clinging day and night to the  chapel altars,\" barefoot or [26] in patched sandals.  With or even  without Nicolette, \"his sweet mistress whom he so much loves,\"  he, for his part, is ready to start on the way to hell, along with  \"the good scholars,\" as he says, and the actors, and the fine  horsemen dead in battle, and the men of fashion,* and \"the fair  courteous ladies who had two or three chevaliers apiece beside  their own true lords,\" all gay with music, in their gold, and silver,  and beautiful furs--\"the vair and the grey.\"    But in the House Beautiful the saints too have their place; and the  student of the Renaissance has this advantage over the student of  the emancipation of the human mind in the Reformation, or the  French Revolution, that in tracing the footsteps of humanity to  higher levels, he is not beset at every turn by the inflexibilities  and antagonisms of some well-recognised controversy, with  rigidly defined opposites, exhausting the intelligence and limiting  one's sympathies.  The opposition of the professional defenders  of a mere system to that more sincere and generous play of the  forces of human mind and character, which I have noted as the  secret of Abelard's struggle, is indeed always powerful.  But the  incompatibility with one another of souls really \"fair\" is not  essential; and within the enchanted region of the Renaissance,  one needs not be for ever on [27] one's guard.  Here there are no  fixed parties, no exclusions: all breathes of that unity of culture in  which whatsoever things are comely\" are reconciled, for the  elevation and adorning of our spirits.  And just in proportion as  those who took part in the Renaissance become centrally  representative of it, just so much the more is this condition  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#5)"],[1,"of an ordinary star. But, in the  course of three or four months, the delicate photographs taken at the  Lick Observatory showed that a nebulous light surrounded the star, and  was continually growing larger and larger. At first sight, there would  seem to be nothing extraordinary in this fact. Great masses of  intensely hot vapor, shining by their own light, would naturally be  thrown out from the star. Or, if the star had originally been  surrounded by a very rare nebulous fog or vapor, the latter would be  seen by the brilliant light emitted by the star. On this was based an  explanation offered by Kapteyn, which at first seemed very plausible.  It was that the sudden wave of light thrown out by the star when it  burst forth caused the illumination of the surrounding vapor, which,  though really at rest, would seem to expand with the velocity of light,  as the illumination reached more and more distant regions of the  nebula. This result may be made the subject of exact calculation. The  velocity of light is such as would make a circuit of the earth more  than seven times in a second. It would, therefore, go out from the star  at the rate of a million of miles in between five and six seconds. In  the lapse of one of our days, the light would have filled a sphere  around the star having a diameter more than one hundred and fifty times  the distance of the sun from the earth, and more than five times the  dimensions of the whole solar system. Continuing its course and  enlarging its sphere day after day, the sight presented to us would  have been that of a gradually expanding nebulous mass--a globe of faint  light continually increasing in size with the velocity of light.    The first sentiment the reader will feel on this subject is doubtless  one of surprise that the distance of the star should be so great as  this explanation would imply. Six months after the explosion, the globe  of light, as actually photographed, was of a size which would have been  visible to the naked eye only as a very minute object in the sky. Is it  possible that this minute object could have been thousands of times the  dimensions of our solar system?    To see how the question stands from this point of view, we must have  some idea of the possible distance of the new star. To gain this idea,  we must find some way of estimating distances in the universe. For a  reason which will soon be apparent, we begin with the greatest  structure which nature offers to the view of man. We all know that the  Milky Way is formed of countless stars, too minute to be individually  visible to the naked eye. The more powerful the telescope through which  we sweep the heavens, the greater the number of the stars that can be  seen in it. With the powerful instruments which are now in use for  photographing the sky, the number of stars brought to light must rise  into the hundreds of millions, and the greater part of these belong to  the Milky Way. The smaller the stars we count, the greater their  comparative number in the region of the Milky Way. Of the stars visible  through the telescope, more than one-half are found in the Milky Way,  which may be regarded as a girdle spanning the entire visible universe.    Of the diameter of this girdle we can say, almost with certainty, that  it must be more than a thousand times as great as the distance of the  nearest fixed star from us, and is probably two or three times greater.  According to the best judgment we can form, our solar system is situate  near the central region of the girdle, so that the latter must be  distant from us by half its diameter. It follows that if we can imagine  a gigantic pair of compasses, of which the points extend from us to  Alpha Centauri, the nearest star, we should have to measure out at  least five hundred spaces with the compass, and perhaps even one  thousand or more, to reach the region of the Milky Way.    With this we have to connect another curious fact. Of eighteen new  stars which have been observed to blaze forth during the last four  hundred years, all are in the region of the Milky Way. This seems to  show that, as a rule, they belong to the Milky Way. Accepting this very  plausible conclusion, the new star in Perseus must have been more than  five hundred times as far as the nearest fixed star. We know that it  takes light four years to reach us from Alpha Centauri. It follows that  the new star was at a distance through which light would require more  than two thousand years to travel, and quite likely a time two or three  times this. It requires only the most elementary ideas of geometry to  see that if we suppose a ray of light to shoot from a star at such a  distance in a direction perpendicular to the line of sight from us to  the star, we can compute how fast the ray would seem to us to travel.  Granting the distance to be only two thousand light years, the apparent  size of the sphere around the star which the light would fill at the  end of one year after the explosion would be that of a coin seen at a  distance of two thousand times its radius, or one thousand times its  diameter--say, a five-cent piece at the distance of sixty feet. But, as  a matter of fact, the nebulous illumination expanded with a velocity  from ten to twenty times as great as this.    The idea that the nebulosity around the new star was formed by the  illumination caused by the light of the explosion spreading out on all  sides therefore fails to satisfy us, not because the expansion of the  nebula seemed to be so slow, but because it was many times as swift as  the speed of light. Another reason for believing that it was not a mere  wave of light is offered by the fact that it did not take place  regularly in every direction from the star, but seemed to shoot off at  various angles.    Up to the present time, the speed of light has been to science, as well  as to the intelligence of our race, almost a symbol of the greatest of  possible speeds. The more carefully we reflect on the case, the more  clearly we shall see the difficulty in supposing any agency to travel  at the rate of the seeming emanations from the new star in Perseus.    As the emanation is seen spreading day after day, the reader may  inquire whether this is not an appearance due to some other cause than  the mere motion of light. May not an explosion taking place in the  centre of a star produce an effect which shall travel yet faster than  light? We can only reply that no such agency is known to science.    But is there really anything intrinsically improbable in an agency  travelling with a speed many times that of light? In considering that  there is, we may fall into an error very much like that into which our  predecessors fell in thinking it entirely out of the range of  reasonable probability that the stars should be placed at such  distances as we now know them to be.    Accepting it as a fact that agencies do exist which travel from sun to  planet and from star to star with a speed which beggars all our  previous ideas, the first question that arises is that of their nature  and mode of action. This question is, up to the present time, one which  we do not see any way of completely answering. The first difficulty is  that we have no evidence of these agents except that afforded by their  action. We see that the sun goes through a regular course of  pulsations, each requiring eleven years for completion; and we see  that, simultaneously with these, the earth's magnetism goes through a  similar course of pulsations. The connection of the two, therefore,  seems absolutely proven. But when we ask by what agency it is possible  for the sun to affect the magnetism of the earth, and when we trace the  passage of some agent between the two bodies, we find nothing to  explain the action. To all appearance, the space between the earth and  the sun is a perfect void. That electricity cannot of itself pass  through a vacuum seems to be a well-established law of physics. It is  true that electromagnetic waves, which are supposed to be of the same  nature with those of light, and which are used in wireless telegraphy,  do pass through a vacuum and may pass from the sun to the earth. But  there is no way of explaining how such waves would either produce or  affect the magnetism of the earth.    The mysterious emanations from various substances, under certain  conditions, may have an intimate relation with yet another of the  mysteries of the universe. It is a fundamental law of the universe that  when a body emits light or heat, or anything capable of being  transformed into light or heat, it can do so only by the expenditure of  force, limited in supply. The sun and stars are continually sending out  a flood of heat. They are exhausting the internal supply of something  which must be limited in extent. Whence comes the supply? How is the  heat of the sun kept up? If it were a hot body cooling off, a very few  years would suffice for it to cool off so far that its surface would  become solid and very soon cold. In recent years, the theory  universally accepted has been that the supply of heat is kept up by the  continual contraction of the sun, by mutual gravitation of its parts as  it cools off. This theory has the advantage of enabling us to  calculate, with some approximation to exactness, at what rate the sun  must be contracting in order to keep up the supply of heat which it  radiates. On this theory, it must, ten millions of years ago, have had  twice its present diameter, while less than twenty millions of years  ago it could not have existed except as an immense nebula filling the  whole solar system. We must bear in mind that this theory is the only  one which accounts for the supply of heat, even through human history.  If it be true, then the sun, earth, and solar system must be less than  twenty million years old.    Here the geologists step in and tell us that this conclusion is wholly"]]]
