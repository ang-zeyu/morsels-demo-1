The big Weeoombeen looked round and  gave him a warning sign, but too late, Piggiebillah had heard the cry  and was hastening towards them. Quickly big Weeoombeen left the emu and  joined his little brother.    Piggiebillah, when he came up, said: \"What have you found?\"    \"Nothing,\" said the big Weeoombeen, \"nothing but some mistletoe  berries.\"    \"It must have been something more than that, or your little brother  would not have called out so loudly.\"    Little Weeoombeen was so afraid that Piggiebillah would find their emu  and take it, that he said: \"I hit a little bird with a stone, and I was  glad I could throw so straight.\"    \"It was no cry for the killing of a little bird or for the finding of  mistletoe berries that I heard. It was for something much more than  either, or you would not have called out so joyfully. If you do not  tell me at once I will kill you both.\"    The Weeoombeen brothers were frightened, for Piggiebillah was a great  fighter and very strong, so when they saw he was really angry, they  showed him the dead emu.    \"Just what I want for my supper,\" he said, and so saying, dragged it  away to his own camp. The Weeoombeens followed him and even helped him  to make a fire to cook the emu, hoping by so doing to get a share given  to them. But Piggiebillah would not give them any; he said he must have  it all for himself.    Angry and disappointed, the Weeoombeens marched straight off and told  some black fellows who lived near, that Piggiebillah had a fine fat emu  just cooked for supper.    Up jumped the black fellows, seized their spears, bade the Weeoombeens  quickly lead them to Piggiebillah's camp, promising them for so doing a  share of the emu.    When they were within range of spear shot, the black fellows formed a  circle, took aim, and threw their spears at Piggiebillah. As the spears  fell thick on him, sticking out all over him, Piggiebillah cried aloud:  \"Bingehlah, Bingeblah. You can have it, you can have it.\" But the black  fellows did not desist until Piggiebillah was too wounded even to cry  out; then they left him a mass of spears and turned to look for the  emu. But to their surprise they found it not. Then for the first time  they missed the Weeoombeens.    Looking round they saw their tracks going to where the emu had  evidently been; then they saw that they had dragged the emu to their  nyunnoo, which was a humpy made of grass.    When the Weeoombeens saw the black fellows coming, they caught hold of  the emu and dragged it to a big hole they knew of, with a big stone at  its entrance, which stone only they knew the secret of moving. They  moved the stone, got the emu and themselves into the hole, and the  stone in place again before the black fellows reached the place.    The black fellows tried to move the stone, but could not. Yet they knew  that the Weeoombeens must have done so, for they had tracked them right  up to it, and they could hear the sound of their voices on the other  side of it. They saw there was a crevice on either side of the stone,  between it and the ground. Through these crevices they, drove in their  spears, thinking they must surely kill the brothers. But the  Weeoombeens too had seen these crevices and had anticipated the spears,  so they had placed the dead emu before them to act as a shield. And  into its body were driven the spears of the black fellows extended for  the Weeoombeens.    Having driven the spears well in, the black fellows went off to get  help to move the stone, but when they had gone a little way they heard  the Weeoombeens laughing. Back they came and speared again, and again  started for help, only as they left to hear once more the laughter of  the brothers.    The Weeoombeens finding their laughter only brought back the black  fellows to a fresh attack, determined to keep quiet, which, after the  next spearing, they did.    Quite sure, when they heard their spear shots followed by neither  conversation nor laughter, that they had killed the Weeoombeens at  last, the black fellows hurried away to bring back the strength and  cunning of the camp, to remove the stone.    The Weeoombeens hurriedly discussed what plan they had better adopt to  elude the black fellows, for well they knew that should they ever meet  any of them again they would be killed without mercy. And as they  talked they satisfied their hunger by eating some of the emu flesh.    After a while the black fellows returned, and soon was the stone  removed from the entrance. Some of them crept into the hole, where, to  their surprise, they found only the remains of the emu and no trace of  the Weeoombeens. As those who had gone in first crept out and told of  the disappearance of the Weeoombeens, others, incredulous of such a  story, crept in to find it confirmed. They searched round for tracks;  seeing that their spears were all in the emu it seemed to them probable  the Weeoombeens had escaped alive, but if so, whither they had gone  their tracks would show. But search as they would no tracks could they  find. All they could see were two little birds which sat on a bush near  the hole, watching the black fellows all the time. The little birds  flew round the hole sometimes, but never away, always returning to  their bush and seeming to be discussing the whole affair; but what they  said the black fellows could not understand. But as time went on and no  sign was ever found of the Weeoombeens, the black fellows became sure  that the brothers had turned into the little white-throated birds which  had sat on the bush by the hole, so, they supposed, to escape their  vengeance. And ever afterwards the little white-throats were called  Weeoombeens. And the memory of Piggiebillah is perpetuated by a sort of  porcupine ant-eater, which bears his name, and whose skin is covered  closely with miniature spears sticking all over it.          7.  BOOTOOLGAH THE CRANE AND GOONUR THE KANGAROO RAT, THE FIRE MAKERS      In the days when Bootoolgah, the crane, married Goonur, the kangaroo  rat, there was no fire in their country. They had to eat their food raw  or just dry it in the sun. One day when Bootoolgah was rubbing two  pieces of wood together, he saw a faint spark sent forth and then a  slight smoke. \"Look,\" he said to Goonur, \"see what comes when I rub  these pieces of wood together--smoke! Would it not be good if we could  make fire for ourselves with which to cook our food, so as not to have  to wait for the sun to dry it?\"    Goonur looked, and, seeing the smoke, she said: \"Great indeed would be  the day when we could make fire. Split your stick, Bootoolgah, and  place in the opening bark and grass that even one spark may kindle a  light.\" And hearing wisdom in her words, even as she said Bootoolgah  did. And lo! after much rubbing, from the opening came a small flame.  For as Goonur had said it would, the spark lit the grass, the bark  smouldered and smoked, and so Bootoolgah the crane, and Goonur the  kangaroo rat, discovered the art of fire making.    \"This we will keep secret,\" they said, \"from all the tribes. When we  make a fire to cook our fish we will go into a Bingahwingul scrub.  There we will make a fire and cook our food in secret. We will hide our  firesticks in the openmouthed seeds of the Bingahwinguls; one firestick  we will carry always hidden in our comebee.\"    Bootoolgah and Goonur cooked the next fish they caught, and found it  very good. When they went back to the camp they took some of their  cooked fish with them. The blacks noticed it looked quite different  from the usual sun-dried fish, so they asked: \"What did you to that  fish?\"    \"Let it lie in the sun,\" said they.    \"Not so,\" said the others.    But that the fish was sun-dried Bootoolgah and Goonur persisted. Day by  day passed, and after catching their fish, these two always  disappeared, returning with their food looking quite different from  that of the others. At last, being unable to extract any information  from them, it was determined by the tribe to watch them. Boolooral, the  night owl, and Quarrian, the parrot, were appointed to follow the two  when they disappeared, to watch where they went, and find out what they  did. Accordingly, after the next fish were caught, when Bootoolgah and  Goonur gathered up their share and started for the bush, Boolooral and  Quarrian followed on their tracks. They saw them disappear into a  Bingahwingul scrub, where they lost sight of them. Seeing a high tree  on the edge of the scrub, they climbed up it, and from there they saw  all that was to be seen. They saw Bootoolgah and Goonur throw down  their load of fish, open their comebee and take from it a stick, which  stick, when they had blown upon it, they laid in the midst of a heap of  leaves and twigs, and at once from this heap they saw a flame leap,  which flame the fire makers fed with bigger sticks. Then, as the flame  died down, they saw the two place their fish in the ashes that remained  from the burnt sticks. Then back to the camp of their tribes went  Boolooral and Quarrian, back with the news of their discovery. Great  was the talk amongst the blacks, and many the queries as to how to get  possession of the comebee with the fire stick in it, when next  Bootoolgah and Goonur came into the camp. It was at length decided to  hold a corrobboree, and it was to be one on a scale not often seen,  probably never before by the young of the tribes. The grey beards  proposed to so astonish Bootoolgah and Goonur as to make them forget to  guard their precious comebee. As soon as they were intent on the  corrobboree and off guard, some one was to seize the comebee, steal the  firestick and start fires for the good of all. Most of them had tasted  the cooked fish brought into the camp by the fire makers and, having  found it good, hungered for it. Beeargah, the hawk, was told to feign  sickness, to tie up his head, and to lie down near wherever the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#5)"],[1,"and the western foothills of the central and northern  Rockies. By so doing that subspecies came into secondary contact with  its own parent stock with which it was still in reproductive  continuity in Utah. In some places in British Columbia differentiation  between the two kinds had proceeded to such an extent that some  reproductive isolation was effected, but in many other places the two  interbred. The Rocky Mountain form spread north and west and occupied  the Cascades and coastal lowlands in southwestern British Columbia and  in Washington. Here the differentiation between the Rocky Mountain  subspecies and the Great Basin subspecies was great enough to cause  complete reproductive isolation.       [Illustration: FIG. 9. Probable changes in the distribution of        _Sorex vagrans_ concurrent with and following the dissipation        of Wisconsinan ice. Dark arrows in Washington, Idaho, Oregon,        and California, shows_ S. v. vagrans_.]    Deglaciation of the Sierra Nevada opened it up for reoccupation from  the east by _Sorex vagrans_ of the Great Basin. In response to the  montane environment the subspecies _obscuroides_, resembling the  subspecies _obscurus_ of the Rockies, developed.    Desiccation of the intermontane parts of New Mexico, Arizona, and  Chihuahua, left \"marooned\" populations of _Sorex vagrans_ on suitable  mountain ranges. In this way _Sorex vagrans orizabae_ may have been  isolated in southern Mexico. The isolated populations of Arizona and  New Mexico differentiated _in situ_ into the subspecies _monticola_  and _neomexicanus_.    Western Canada and Alaska were populated by shrews which originated in  the habitable parts of the Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau during  Wisconsinan time (as opposed to shrews originating, as subspecies, in  the Great Basin or on the Pacific Coast). These shrews differentiated  into the currently recognized subspecies of the west coast and coastal  islands of British Columbia and Alaska in response to the different  environments in these places, many of which were isolated; the  subspecies _isolatus_, _mixtus_, _setosus_, _longicauda_, _elassodon_,  _prevostensis_, _malitiosus_, and _alaskensis_ are thought to have  originated in this fashion after the areas now occupied by them were  freed of Wisconsinan ice.    This group of shrews from the Rocky Mountains probably came into  contact with the Pacific coastal segment of the species somewhere in  northwestern Oregon. The clinal decrease in size from _S. v.  pacificus_ to _S. v. setosus_ seems steepest in this area. Upon the  establishment of this contact reproductive continuity was resumed,  probably because the temporal separation of the two stocks involved  was not so great as, say, that between _S. v. vagrans_ and _S. v.  pacificus_, and in addition the morphological differentiation was not  so great.    On the eastern side of the Rockies the montane stock moved  northeastward, occupying suitable territory opened up by the  dissolution of the Laurentide ice sheet. Still later changes in the  character of the northern plains owing to desiccation divided the  range of the species and isolated _S. v. soperi_ in Manitoba and  central Saskatchewan and a population of _S. v. obscurus_, in the  Cypress Hills. A number of semi-isolated stocks in central Montana  became differentiated as a recognizable subspecies there.    A number of other boreal mammals have geographic ranges which resemble  that of _Sorex vagrans_, except that the geographic ranges of  subspecies do not overlap. Because of the general similarities of  these geographic ranges, it is pertinent to examine the reasons  suggested by students to account for the present geographic  distributions of some of these other boreal species.    The red squirrel genus, _Tamiasciurus_, has a Rocky Mountain (and  northern coniferous forest) species, _T. hudsonicus_, that occurs all  along the Rocky Mountain chain and northward into Alaska. In the  Cascade Mountains of Washington and British Columbia this species  meets the range of a well marked western species, _T. douglasii_, with  no evidence of intergradation. Dalquest (1948:86) attributes the  divergence of the two species to separation in a glacial age but feels  that the degree of difference between the two is too great to have all  taken place during the Wisconsinan. Perhaps he has overemphasized the  importance of the differences between the two, but, be that as it may,  it seems that the two kinds differentiated during a glacial age when  they were isolated, perhaps by ice on the Cascades into a coastal  population and an inland population. One difference between the  distribution of the red squirrels and vagrant shrew is that the  squirrel of the Sierra Nevada is the species of the Pacific Coast,  whereas the vagrant shrew of the Sierra Nevada was derived from the  Great Basin population, which in turn was derived from the Rocky  Mountain kind. Red squirrels do not occur on any of the boreal montane  \"islands\" of Nevada. During the pluvial periods when hydrosere-loving  shrews populated the Great Basin, that region may have been a treeless  grassland. Vagrant shrews, then as now, probably depended on hydrosere  communities, while red squirrels required trees. Therefore the shrews  were able to traverse the Great Basin, while the Sierran red squirrels  were of necessity derived from the coastal population.    The ecological requirements of jumping mice, genus _Zapus_, and the  subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ that dwell in hydroseres are essentially  similar. The species _Zapus princeps_ lives in the Rocky Mountains,  the Great Basin, the Sierra Nevada, and north to Yukon (Krutzsch,  1954:395). Its geographic range is similar to that of the montane and  basin segments of _S. vagrans_. The species _Z. trinotatus_ occurs  along the Pacific coast and in the Cascades north to southwestern  British Columbia. Its distribution thus coincides in general with that  of the large red coastal subspecies of _S. vagrans_. Krutzsch  (1954:368-369) thought that these two kinds of jumping mice were first  separated by the formation of the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra  Nevada and finally by Pleistocene glaciation. The Sierran jumping  mouse (_Zapus princeps_), as is the Sierran vagrant shrew, is more  closely related to the jumping mouse of the Great Basin and of the  Rocky Mountains than it is to the jumping mouse (_Z. trinotatus_) of  the Pacific Coast, just as the Sierran vagrant shrew is related to the  shrew of the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. The jumping mouse also  is limited in its distribution by hydrosere communities, not by  forests.    In western North America there are two species of water or marsh  shrews: _Sorex palustris_ and _S. bendiri_. They have been placed in  separate subgenera, but, as pointed out beyond, are closely related  and here are placed in the same subgenus. The species _palustris_ is  found throughout the Rocky Mountains, north into Alaska, across the  Great Basin into the Sierra Nevada, and west to the Pacific coast in  Washington. The species _bendiri_ is found from northwestern  California north along the Pacific coast to southwestern British  Columbia and east to the Cascades. Where the ranges of the two species  overlap in western Washington they do not interbreed so far as is  known, and are somewhat different in their ecology, _bendiri_ being a  lowland, and _palustris_ being a montane, species. The two species  probably were separated in a glacial period as seems to have been the  case with the wandering shrews. Also, the water shrew of the Sierra  Nevada is derived from that of the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains.  _Sorex palustris_ is tied closely in its distribution to hydrosere  communities and is not dependent upon the presence of forests.    Red-backed mice, genus _Clethrionomys_, occur throughout the Rocky  Mountains and west to the Cascades in Washington as the species _C.  gapperi_. The species _C. californicus_ is found along the Pacific  Coast from California north to the Olympic Peninsula. Where the ranges  of the two species meet in Washington they seem not to intergrade. In  some glacial interval these two species may have evolved in the same  manner as has been described for the species of _Zapus_ and those of  _Tamiasciurus_. No _Clethrionomys_ are found in the Sierra Nevada, nor  are red-backed mice found in the boreal islands of the Great Basin. It  is not known why _Clethrionomys californicus_ does not occur in the  Sierra Nevada. Some boreal birds have distributional patterns similar  to those of the mammalian examples cited above. One kind of sapsucker,  _Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis_, occurs in the Rocky Mountains north  into British Columbia and west to the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. A  related kind, _S. varius ruber_, occurs along the Pacific Coast from  California north into British Columbia. Recently Howell (1952) has  shown that some intergradation takes place between _ruber_ and  _nuchalis_ in Washington and British Columbia, although they do not  intergrade freely. Previously the two kinds were thought not to  intergrade and were regarded as two species. The two kinds intergrade  also in northeastern California, although in that state _S. v.  daggeti_, rather than _S. v. ruber_, is involved in the  intergradation. Howell considered the two kinds to be conspecific with  one another as well as with the eastern _S. varius_. He attributed a  measure of the distinctness of _nuchalis_ and _ruber_ to their  separation during a glacial period, but felt that the separation was  much older than Wisconsinan. Whatever the time of separation, the  pattern seems clear: _nuchalis_ and _ruber_ (as well as _varius_) were  separated into montane, coastal, and eastern segments respectively,  probably by glaciation (it seems to me in the Pleistocene), and have  since re-established contact with one another.
