No one who heard it could  think an evil thought; no one could feel hopeless or despairing or  bitter or angry. When a man had once heard that music it entered into  his soul and heart and life and became a part of him for ever. Years  went by; the shepherd grew old and bent and feeble; but still he  roamed over land and sea, that his harp might carry the message of the  Christmas night and the angel song to all mankind. At last his strength  failed him and he fell by the wayside in the darkness; but his harp  played as his spirit passed; and it seemed to him that a Shining One  stood by him, with wonderful starry eyes, and said to him, 'Lo, the  music thy harp has played for so many years has been but the echo of the  love and sympathy and purity and beauty in thine own soul; and if at any  time in the wanderings thou hadst opened the door of that soul to evil  or envy or selfishness thy harp would have ceased to play. Now thy life  is ended; but what thou hast given to mankind has no end; and as long as  the world lasts, so long will the heavenly music of the Christmas harp  ring in the ears of men.' When the sun rose the old shepherd lay dead by  the roadside, with a smile on his face; and in his hands was a harp with  all its strings broken.\"    We left the fir woods as the tale was ended, and on the opposite hill  was home. A dim light in the kitchen window betokened that Aunt Janet  had no idea of going to bed until all her young fry were safely housed  for the night.    \"Ma's waiting up for us,\" said Dan. \"I'd laugh if she happened to go to  the door just as Felicity and Peter were strutting up. I guess she'll be  cross. It's nearly twelve.\"    \"Christmas will soon be over,\" said Cecily, with a sigh. \"Hasn't it  been a nice one? It's the first we've all spent together. Do you suppose  we'll ever spend another together?\"    \"Lots of 'em,\" said Dan cheerily. \"Why not?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" answered Cecily, her footsteps lagging somewhat.  \"Only things seem just a little too pleasant to last.\"    \"If Willy Fraser had had as much spunk as Peter, Miss Cecily King  mightn't be so low spirited,\" quoth Dan, significantly.    Cecily tossed her head and disdained reply. There are really some  remarks a self-respecting young lady must ignore.          CHAPTER IV. NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS      If we did not have a white Christmas we had a white New Year. Midway  between the two came a heavy snowfall. It was winter in our orchard of  old delights then,--so truly winter that it was hard to believe summer  had ever dwelt in it, or that spring would ever return to it. There were  no birds to sing the music of the moon; and the path where the apple  blossoms had fallen were heaped with less fragrant drifts. But it was a  place of wonder on a moonlight night, when the snowy arcades shone  like avenues of ivory and crystal, and the bare trees cast fairy-like  traceries upon them. Over Uncle Stephen's Walk, where the snow had  fallen smoothly, a spell of white magic had been woven. Taintless and  wonderful it seemed, like a street of pearl in the new Jerusalem.    On New Year's Eve we were all together in Uncle Alec's kitchen, which  was tacitly given over to our revels during the winter evenings. The  Story Girl and Peter were there, of course, and Sara Ray's mother had  allowed her to come up on condition that she should be home by eight  sharp. Cecily was glad to see her, but the boys never hailed her arrival  with over-much delight, because, since the dark began to come down  early, Aunt Janet always made one of us walk down home with her. We  hated this, because Sara Ray was always so maddeningly self-conscious  of having an escort. We knew perfectly well that next day in school she  would tell her chums as a \"dead\" secret that \"So-and-So King saw her  home\" from the hill farm the night before. Now, seeing a young lady home  from choice, and being sent home with her by your aunt or mother are two  entirely different things, and we thought Sara Ray ought to have sense  enough to know it.    Outside there was a vivid rose of sunset behind the cold hills of fir,  and the long reaches of snowy fields glowed fairily pink in the western  light. The drifts along the edges of the meadows and down the lane  looked as if a series of breaking waves had, by the lifting of a  magician's wand, been suddenly transformed into marble, even to their  toppling curls of foam.    Slowly the splendour died, giving place to the mystic beauty of a winter  twilight when the moon is rising. The hollow sky was a cup of blue. The  stars came out over the white glens and the earth was covered with a  kingly carpet for the feet of the young year to press.    \"I'm so glad the snow came,\" said the Story Girl. \"If it hadn't the New  Year would have seemed just as dingy and worn out as the old. There's  something very solemn about the idea of a New Year, isn't there? Just  think of three hundred and sixty-five whole days, with not a thing  happened in them yet.\"    \"I don't suppose anything very wonderful will happen in them,\" said  Felix pessimistically. To Felix, just then, life was flat, stale and  unprofitable because it was his turn to go home with Sara Ray.    \"It makes me a little frightened to think of all that may happen in  them,\" said Cecily. \"Miss Marwood says it is what we put into a year,  not what we get out of it, that counts at last.\"    \"I'm always glad to see a New Year,\" said the Story Girl. \"I wish we  could do as they do in Norway. The whole family sits up until midnight,  and then, just as the clock is striking twelve, the father opens the  door and welcomes the New Year in. Isn't it a pretty custom?\"    \"If ma would let us stay up till twelve we might do that too,\" said Dan,  \"but she never will. I call it mean.\"    \"If I ever have children I'll let them stay up to watch the New Year  in,\" said the Story Girl decidedly.    \"So will I,\" said Peter, \"but other nights they'll have to go to bed at  seven.\"    \"You ought to be ashamed, speaking of such things,\" said Felicity, with  a scandalized face.    Peter shrank into the background abashed, no doubt believing that he had  broken some Family Guide precept all to pieces.    \"I didn't know it wasn't proper to mention children,\" he muttered  apologetically.    \"We ought to make some New Year resolutions,\" suggested the Story Girl.  \"New Year's Eve is the time to make them.\"    \"I can't think of any resolutions I want to make,\" said Felicity, who  was perfectly satisfied with herself.    \"I could suggest a few to you,\" said Dan sarcastically.    \"There are so many I would like to make,\" said Cecily, \"that I'm afraid  it wouldn't be any use trying to keep them all.\"    \"Well, let's all make a few, just for the fun of it, and see if we can  keep them,\" I said. \"And let's get paper and ink and write them out.  That will make them seem more solemn and binding.\"    \"And then pin them up on our bedroom walls, where we'll see them every  day,\" suggested the Story Girl, \"and every time we break a resolution  we must put a cross opposite it. That will show us what progress we are  making, as well as make us ashamed if we have too many crosses.\"    \"And let's have a Roll of Honour in Our Magazine,\" suggested Felix, \"and  every month we'll publish the names of those who keep their resolutions  perfect.\"    \"I think it's all nonsense,\" said Felicity. But she joined our circle  around the table, though she sat for a long time with a blank sheet  before her.    \"Let's each make a resolution in turn,\" I said. \"I'll lead off.\"    And, recalling with shame certain unpleasant differences of opinion I  had lately had with Felicity, I wrote down in my best hand,    \"I shall try to keep my temper always.\"    \"You'd better,\" said Felicity tactfully.    It was Dan's turn next.    \"I can't think of anything to start with,\" he said, gnawing his  penholder fiercely.    \"You might make a resolution not to eat poison berries,\" suggested  Felicity.    \"You'd better make one not to nag people everlastingly,\" retorted Dan.    \"Oh, don't quarrel the last night of the old year,\" implored Cecily.    \"You might resolve not to quarrel any time,\" suggested Sara Ray.    \"No, sir,\" said Dan emphatically. \"There's no use making a resolution  you CAN'T keep. There are people in this family you've just GOT to  quarrel with if you want to live. But I've thought of one--I won't do  things to spite people.\"    Felicity--who really was in an unbearable mood that night--laughed  disagreeably; but Cecily gave her a fierce nudge, which probably  restrained her from speaking.    \"I will not eat any apples,\" wrote Felix.    \"What on earth do you want to give up eating apples for?\" asked Peter in  astonishment.    \"Never mind,\" returned Felix.    \"Apples make people fat, you know,\" said Felicity sweetly.    \"It seems a funny kind of resolution,\" I said doubtfully. \"I think our  resolutions ought to be giving up wrong things or doing right ones.\"    \"You make your resolutions to suit yourself and I'll make mine to suit  myself,\" said Felix defiantly.    \"I shall never get drunk,\" wrote Peter painstakingly.    \"But you never do,\" said the Story Girl in astonishment.    \"Well, it will be all the easier to keep the resolution,\" argued Peter.    \"That isn't fair,\" complained Dan. \"If we all resolved not to do the  things we never do we'd all be on the Roll of Honour.\"    \"You let Peter alone,\" said Felicity severely. \"It's a very good  resolution and one everybody ought to make.\"    \"I shall not be jealous,\" wrote the Story Girl.    \"But are you?\" I asked, surprised.    The Story Girl coloured and nodded. \"Of one thing,\" she confessed, \"but  I'm not going to tell what it is.\"    \"I'm jealous sometimes, too,\" confessed Sara Ray, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#5)"],[1,"to have to take the chance he'll  recognize you. Isn't that Carthon down there?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Carthon lay nestled under the outlying foothills of the Hellers, ancient  and sprawling and squatty, and burned brown with the dust of five  thousand years. Children ran out to stare at the 'copter as we landed  near the city; few planes ever flew low enough to be seen, this near the  Hellers.    Forth had sent his crew ahead and parked them in an abandoned huge place  at the edge of the city which might once have been a warehouse or a  ruined palace. Inside there were a couple of trucks, stripped down to  framework and flatbed like all machinery shipped through space from  Terra. There were pack animals, dark shapes in the gloom. Crates were  stacked up in an orderly untidiness, and at the far end a fire was  burning and five or six men in Darkovan clothing--loose sleeved shirts,  tight wrapped breeches, low boots--were squatting around it, talking.  They got up as Forth and Kendricks and I walked toward them, and Forth  greeted them clumsily, in bad accented Darkovan, then switched to Terran  Standard, letting one of the men translate for him.    Forth introduced me simply as \"Jason,\" after the Darkovan custom, and I  looked the men over, one by one. Back when I'd climbed for fun, I'd  liked to pick my own men; but whoever had picked this crew must have  known his business.    Three were mountain Darkovans, lean swart men enough alike to be  brothers; I learned after a while that they actually were brothers,  Hjalmar, Garin and Vardo. All three were well over six feet, and Hjalmar  stood head and shoulders over his brothers, whom I never learned to tell  apart. The fourth man, a redhead, was dressed rather better than the  others and introduced as Lerrys Ridenow--the double name indicating high  Darkovan aristocracy. He looked muscular and agile enough, but his hands  were suspiciously well-kept for a mountain man, and I wondered how much  experience he'd had.    The fifth man shook hands with me, speaking to Kendricks and Forth as if  they were old friends. \"Don't I know you from someplace, Jason?\"    He looked Darkovan, and wore Darkovan clothes, but Forth had forewarned  me, and attack seemed the best defense. \"Aren't you Terran?\"    \"My father was,\" he said, and I understood; a situation not exactly  uncommon, but ticklish on a planet like Darkover. I said carelessly, \"I  may have seen you around the HQ. I can't place you, though.\"    \"My name's Rafe Scott. I thought I knew most of the professional guides  on Darkover, but I admit I don't get into the Hellers much,\" he  confessed. \"Which route are we going to take?\"    I found myself drawn into the middle of the group of men, accepting one  of the small sweetish Darkovan cigarettes, looking over the plan  somebody had scribbled down on the top of a packing case. I borrowed a  pencil from Rafe and bent over the case, sketching out a rough map of  the terrain I remembered so well from boyhood. I might be bewildered  about blood fractions, but when it came to climbing I knew what I was  doing. Rafe and Lerrys and the Darkovan brothers crowded behind me to  look over the sketch, and Lerrys put a long fingernail on the route I'd  indicated.    \"Your elevation's pretty bad here,\" he said diffidently, \"and on the  'Narr campaign the trailmen attacked us here, and it was bad fighting  along those ledges.\"    I looked at him with new respect; dainty hands or not, he evidently knew  the country. Kendricks patted the blaster on his hip and said grimly,  \"But this isn't the 'Narr campaign. I'd like to see any trailmen attack  us while I have this.\"    \"But you're not going to have it,\" said a voice behind us, a crisp  authoritative voice. \"Take off that gun, man!\"    Kendricks and I whirled together, to see the speaker; a tall young  Darkovan, still standing in the shadows. The newcomer spoke to me  directly:    \"I'm told you are Terran, but that you understand the trailmen. Surely  you don't intend to carry fission or fusion weapons against them?\"    And I suddenly realized that we were in Darkovan territory now, and that  we must reckon with the Darkovan horror of guns or of any weapon which  reaches beyond the arm's-length of the man who wields it. A simple  heat-gun, to the Darkovan ethical code, is as reprehensible as a  super-cobalt planetbuster.    Kendricks protested, \"We can't travel unarmed through trailmen country!  We're apt to meet hostile bands of the creatures--and they're nasty with  those long knives they carry!\"    The stranger said calmly, \"I've no objection to you, or anyone else,  carrying a knife for self-defense.\"    \"A _knife_?\" Kendricks drew breath to roar. \"Listen, you bug-eyed  son-of-a--who do you think you are, anyway?\"    The Darkovans muttered. The man in the shadows said, \"Regis Hastur.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Kendricks stared pop-eyed. My own eyes could have popped, but I decided  it was time for me to take charge, if I were ever going to. I rapped,  \"All right, this is my show. Buck, give me the gun.\"    He looked wrathfully at me for a space of seconds, while I wondered what  I'd do if he didn't. Then, slowly, he unbuckled the straps and handed it  to me, butt first.    I'd never realized quite how undressed a Spaceforce man looked without  his blaster. I balanced it on my palm for a minute while Regis Hastur  came out of the shadows. He was tall, and had the reddish hair and fair  skin of Darkovan aristocracy, and on his face was some indefinable  stamp--arrogance, perhaps, or the consciousness that the Hasturs had  ruled this world for centuries long before the Terrans brought ships and  trade and the universe to their doors. He was looking at me as if he  approved of me, and that was one step worse than the former situation.    So, using the respectful Darkovan idiom of speaking to a superior (which  he was) but keeping my voice hard, I said, \"There's just one leader on  any trek, Lord Hastur. On this one, I'm it. If you want to discuss  whether or not we carry guns, I suggest you discuss it with me in  private--and let me give the orders.\"    One of the Darkovans gasped. I knew I could have been mobbed. But with a  mixed bag of men, I had to grab leadership quick or be relegated to  nowhere. I didn't give Regis Hastur a chance to answer that, either; I  said, \"Come back here. I want to talk to you anyway.\"    He came, and I remembered to breathe. I led the way to a fairly deserted  corner of the immense place, faced him and demanded, \"As for you--what  are you doing here? You're not intending to cross the mountains with  us?\"    He met my scowl levelly. \"I certainly am.\"    I groaned. \"Why? You're the Regent's grandson. Important people don't  take on this kind of dangerous work. If anything happens to you, it will  be my responsibility!\" I was going to have enough trouble, I was  thinking, without shepherding along one of the most revered Personages  on the whole damned planet! I didn't want anyone around who had to be  fawned on, or deferred to, or even listened to.           *       *       *       *       *    He frowned slightly, and I had the unpleasant impression that he knew  what I was thinking. \"In the first place--it will mean something to the  trailmen, won't it--to have a Hastur with you, suing for this favor?\"    It certainly would. The trailmen paid little enough heed to the ordinary  humans, except for considering them fair game for plundering when they  came uninvited into trailman country. But they, with all Darkover,  revered the Hasturs, and it was a fine point of diplomacy--if the  Darkovans sent their most important leader, they might listen to him.    \"In the second place,\" Regis Hastur continued, \"the Darkovans are my  people, and it's my business to negotiate for them. In the third place,  I know the trailmen's dialect--not well, but I can speak it a little.  And in the fourth, I've climbed mountains all my life. Purely as an  amateur, but I can assure you I won't be in the way.\"    There was little enough I could say to that. He seemed to have covered  every point--or every point but one, and he added, shrewdly, after a  minute, \"Don't worry; I'm perfectly willing to have you take charge. I  won't claim--privilege.\"    I had to be satisfied with that.           *       *       *       *       *    Darkover is a civilized planet with a fairly high standard of living,  but it is not a mechanized or a technological culture. The people don't  do much mining, or build factories, and the few which were founded by  Terran enterprise never were very successful; outside the Terran Trade  City, machinery or modern transportation is almost unknown.    While the other men checked and loaded supplies and Rafe Scott went out  to contact some friends of his and arrange for last-minute details, I  sat down with Forth to memorize the medical details I must put so  clearly to the trailmen.    \"If we could only have kept your medical knowledge!\"    \"Trouble is, being a doctor doesn't suit my personality,\" I said. I felt  absurdly light-hearted. Where I sat, I could raise my head and study the  panorama of blackish-green foothills which lay beyond Carthon, and  search out the stone roadways, like a tiny white ribbon, which we could  follow for the first stage of the trip. Forth evidently did not share my  enthusiasm.    \"You know, Jason, there is one real danger--\"    \"Do you think I care about danger? Or are you afraid I'll  turn--foolhardy?\"    \"Not exactly. It's not a physical danger, Jason. It's an emotional--or  rather an intellectual danger.\"    \"Hell, don't you know any language but that psycho double-talk?\"    \"Let me finish, Jason. Jay Allison may have been repressed,  overcontrolled, but you are seriously impulsive. You lack a  balance-wheel, if I could put it that way. And if you run too many  risks, your buried alter-ego may come to the surface and take"]]]
