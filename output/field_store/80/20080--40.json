ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES      #Lepisosteus osseus oxyurus# (Linnaeus): Stations A-1, W-2, W-3, G-2,  G-3, G-4, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-5, C-8.    Of 34 longnose gar taken, 27 were young-of-the-year. The latter were  from shallow isolated pools (bedrock bottom at C-1, C-3, C-4; gravel  bottom at C-6). At station W-1 in moderate flood conditions several  young-of-the-year were found in the most sheltered water next to the  banks.    The longnose gar was found only in the lower parts of the streams  surveyed (but were observed by me in smaller tributaries of these  streams in years when the streams had a greater volume of flow). A  preference for downstream habitat is suggested in several other surveys:  Cross (1950:134, 1954a:307) on the South Fork of the Cottonwood and on  Stillwater Creek; Cross and Moore (1952:401) on the Poteau and Fourche  Maline rivers; Moore and Buck (1953:21) on the Chikaskia River.      #Lepisosteus platostomus# Rafinesque: One shortnose gar (K. U. 3157) has  been taken from the Arkansas River in Cowley County. This gar was taken  by Mr. Richard Rinker on a bank line on April 10, 1955, at station A-3.      #Dorosoma cepedianum# (Le Sueur): Stations W-3, G-4, C-4, C-5, M-1, E-1,  E-4.

The two good women who managed Auchincloss's large  household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into  their kitchen with the ever-flowing stream of clear, cold mountain  water.    As it happened this day Dale encountered Al Auchincloss sitting in the  shade of a porch, talking to some of his sheep-herders and stockmen.  Auchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width  of shoulder. He had no gray hairs, and he did not look old, yet there  was in his face a certain weariness, something that resembled sloping  lines of distress, dim and pale, that told of age and the ebb-tide of  vitality. His features, cast in large mold, were clean-cut and comely,  and he had frank blue eyes, somewhat sad, yet still full of spirit.    Dale had no idea how his visit would be taken, and he certainly would  not have been surprised to be ordered off the place. He had not set foot  there for years. Therefore it was with surprise that he saw Auchincloss  wave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular  expression.    \"Howdy, Al! How are you?\" greeted Dale, easily, as he leaned his rifle  against the log wall.    Auchincloss did not rise, but he offered his hand.    \"Wal, Milt Dale, I reckon this is the first time I ever seen you that I  couldn't lay you flat on your back,\" replied the rancher. His tone was  both testy and full of pathos.    \"I take it you mean you ain't very well,\" replied Dale. \"I'm sorry, Al.\"    \"No, it ain't thet. Never was sick in my life. I'm just played out, like  a hoss thet had been strong an' willin', an' did too much.... Wal, you  don't look a day older, Milt. Livin' in the woods rolls over a man's  head.\"    \"Yes, I'm feelin' fine, an' time never bothers me.\"    \"Wal, mebbe you ain't such a fool, after all. I've wondered  lately--since I had time to think.... But, Milt, you don't git no  richer.\"    \"Al, I have all I want an' need.\"    \"Wal, then, you don't support anybody; you don't do any good in the  world.\"    \"We don't agree, Al,\" replied Dale, with his slow smile.    \"Reckon we never did.... An' you jest come over to pay your respects to  me, eh?\"    \"Not altogether,\" answered Dale, ponderingly. \"First off, I'd like to  say I'll pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed.\"    \"You will! An' how'd you go about that?\"    \"Wasn't very many sheep, was there?    \"A matter of fifty head.\"    \"So many! Al, do you still think old Tom killed them sheep?\"    \"Humph! Milt, I know damn well he did.\"    \"Al, now how could you know somethin' I don't? Be reasonable, now. Let's  don't fall out about this again. I'll pay back the sheep. Work it out--\"    \"Milt Dale, you'll come down here an' work out that fifty head of  sheep!\" ejaculated the old rancher, incredulously.    \"Sure.\"    \"Wal, I'll be damned!\" He sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at Dale.  \"What's got into you, Milt? Hev you heard about my niece thet's comin',  an' think you'll shine up to her?\"    \"Yes, Al, her comin' has a good deal to do with my deal,\" replied Dale,  soberly. \"But I never thought to shine up to her, as you hint.\"    \"Haw! Haw! You're just like all the other colts hereabouts. Reckon it's  a good sign, too. It'll take a woman to fetch you out of the woods. But,  boy, this niece of mine, Helen Rayner, will stand you on your head.  I never seen her. They say she's jest like her mother. An' Nell  Auchincloss--what a girl she was!\"    Dale felt his face grow red. Indeed, this was strange conversation for  him.    \"Honest, Al--\" he began.    \"Son, don't lie to an old man.\"    \"Lie! I wouldn't lie to any one. Al, it's only men who live in towns an'  are always makin' deals. I live in the forest, where there's nothin' to  make me lie.\"    \"Wal, no offense meant, I'm sure,\" responded Auchincloss. \"An' mebbe  there's somethin' in what you say... We was talkin' about them sheep  your big cat killed. Wal, Milt, I can't prove it, that's sure. An' mebbe  you'll think me doddery when I tell you my reason. It wasn't what them  greaser herders said about seein' a cougar in the herd.\"    \"What was it, then?\" queried Dale, much interested.    \"Wal, thet day a year ago I seen your pet. He was lyin' in front of the  store an' you was inside tradin', fer supplies, I reckon. It was like  meetin' an enemy face to face. Because, damn me if I didn't know that  cougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes! There!\"    The old rancher expected to be laughed at. But Dale was grave.    \"Al, I know how you felt,\" he replied, as if they were discussing an  action of a human being. \"Sure I'd hate to doubt old Tom. But he's a  cougar. An' the ways of animals are strange... Anyway, Al, I'll make  good the loss of your sheep.\"    \"No, you won't,\" rejoined Auchincloss, quickly. \"We'll call it off. I'm  takin' it square of you to make the offer. Thet's enough. So forget your  worry about work, if you had any.\"    \"There's somethin' else, Al, I wanted to say,\" began Dale, with  hesitation. \"An' it's about Beasley.\"    Auchincloss started violently, and a flame of red shot into his face.  Then he raised a big hand that shook. Dale saw in a flash how the old  man's nerves had gone.    \"Don't mention--thet--thet greaser--to me!\" burst out the rancher. \"It  makes me see--red.... Dale, I ain't overlookin' that you spoke up fer  me to-day--stood fer my side. Lem Harden told me. I was glad. An' thet's  why--to-day--I forgot our old quarrel.... But not a word about thet  sheep-thief--or I'll drive you off the place!\"    \"But, Al--be reasonable,\" remonstrated Dale. \"It's necessary thet I  speak of--of Beasley.\"    \"It ain't. Not to me. I won't listen.\"    \"Reckon you'll have to, Al,\" returned Dale. \"Beasley's after your  property. He's made a deal--\"    \"By Heaven! I know that!\" shouted Auchincloss, tottering up, with his  face now black-red. \"Do you think thet's new to me? Shut up, Dale! I  can't stand it.\"    \"But Al--there's worse,\" went on Dale, hurriedly. \"Worse! Your life's  threatened--an' your niece, Helen--she's to be--\"    \"Shut up--an' clear out!\" roared Auchincloss, waving his huge fists.    He seemed on the verge of a collapse as, shaking all over, he backed  into the door. A few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful  old man.    \"But, Al--I'm your friend--\" began Dale, appealingly.    \"Friend, hey?\" returned the rancher, with grim, bitter passion. \"Then  you're the only one.... Milt Dale, I'm rich an' I'm a dyin' man. I trust  nobody... But, you wild hunter--if you're my friend--prove it!... Go  kill thet greaser sheep-thief! DO somethin'--an' then come talk to me!\"    With that he lurched, half falling, into the house, and slammed the  door.    Dale stood there for a blank moment, and then, taking up his rifle, he  strode away.    Toward sunset Dale located the camp of his four Mormon friends, and  reached it in time for supper.    John, Roy, Joe, and Hal Beeman were sons of a pioneer Mormon who had  settled the little community of Snowdrop. They were young men in years,  but hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured.  Only a year's difference in age stood between John and Roy, and between  Roy and Joe, and likewise Joe and Hal. When it came to appearance they  were difficult to distinguish from one another. Horsemen, sheep-herders,  cattle-raisers, hunters--they all possessed long, wiry, powerful frames,  lean, bronzed, still faces, and the quiet, keen eyes of men used to the  open.    Their camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens,  some three miles from Pine; and, though working for Beasley, near  the village, they had ridden to and fro from camp, after the habit of  seclusion peculiar to their kind.    Dale and the brothers had much in common, and a warm regard had sprang  up. But their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things  pertaining to the forest. Dale ate supper with them, and talked as usual  when he met them, without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his  mind. After the meal he helped Joe round up the horses, hobble them for  the night, and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines. Later,  when the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind, and the  camp-fire glowed comfortably, Dale broached the subject that possessed  him.    \"An' so you're working for Beasley?\" he queried, by way of starting  conversation.    \"We was,\" drawled John. \"But to-day, bein' the end of our month, we got  our pay an' quit. Beasley sure was sore.\"    \"Why'd you knock off?\"    John essayed no reply, and his brothers all had that quiet, suppressed  look of knowledge under restraint.    \"Listen to what I come to tell you, then you'll talk,\" went on Dale. And  hurriedly he told of Beasley's plot to abduct Al Auchincloss's niece and  claim the dying man's property.    When Dale ended, rather breathlessly, the Mormon boys sat without any  show of surprise or feeling. John, the eldest, took up a stick and  slowly poked the red embers of the fire, making the white sparks fly.    \"Now, Milt, why'd you tell us thet?\" he asked, guardedly.    \"You're the only friends I've got,\" replied Dale. \"It didn't seem safe  for me to talk down in the village. I thought of you boys right off. I  ain't goin' to let Snake Anson get that girl. An' I need help, so I come  to you.\"    \"Beasley's strong around Pine, an' old Al's weakenin'. Beasley will git  the property, girl or no girl,\" said John.    \"Things don't always turn out as they look. But no matter about that.  The girl deal is what riled me.... She's to arrive at Magdalena on  the sixteenth, an' take stage for Snowdrop.... Now what to do? If she  travels on that stage I'll be on it, you bet. But she oughtn't to be in  it at all. ... Boys, somehow I'm goin' to save her. Will you help me? I  reckon I've been in some tight corners for you. Sure, this 's different.  But are you my friends? You know now what Beasley is. An' you're all  lost at the hands of Snake Anson's "]]]
