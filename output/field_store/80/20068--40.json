So the  following morning found us in the old field where he had first  placed the bait. Taking my bottle containing bait. I sprinkled some  on a bunch of bushes left there the day previous. This was all that  was required and the bees that had been having a feast at this  location the day before soon found it out and eagerly settled down  for another feast. It seemed that the whole apiary had swarmed out  and come to the bait--hundreds were soon flying towards this  apiary. Here my friend ventured to ask if I was not convinced that  they went to the apiary. I had been watching very close and knew  very well that the majority of the bees did go there, but I had  also seen a few bees fly a short distance on the course and bear  off to the left. I said nothing about this at the time, thinking it  best to be positive before giving a final opinion. There was a deep  hollow running up from the opposite side of the clearing and  getting in a more favorable position I could see many bees bear off  from the main course and go up to the hollow. Now I was ready to  tell him he had been outwitted by the bees.    Calling him to me, I showed him the bees flying up the hollow. We  then moved the bait about one hundred yards farther up and found  that they still went on up. We left the bait and proceeded to look  at the timber. Finally one hundred yards above this last place  there was a large white pine standing on the left side of the  hollow and not over ten feet from the ground they were pouring in,  in a steady stream, pure golden Italians. Was he convinced this was  the bee we had started with from the watering place? No, not at  all. It was too far from the course. I told him we would cut it and  take it home, and if bees still continued to water at the same  location I would give in. The bee was cut next day and taken home  and all watering ceased at that place. This was evidence enough for  him and proved to him, as it must to every one, that under certain  conditions bees will vary very much from a straight line of flight.        CHAPTER IX.    BAITS AND SCENTS.    In rambling through the woods and over the mountains I have seen  bee hunters using bait with the oil of anise in it, or perhaps a  bait containing several different scents. They did not seem to  know, nor care, that bait containing these oils was injurious to  bees; but the fact is well known that they are injurious--not to  our neighbor's bees alone, but to the ones we are trying to find.  Therefore, never combine baits with scents of any kind. The former  is intended to furnish feed for the bee, and when loaded will  always start for the home. The latter is used as a means of getting  them to come to bait.    There are many different scents used for enticing the bee to bait.  Some hunters prefer oil of anise, others use bergamont; then some  combine these or other scents. But bear in mind that what should be  used ought to conform as nearly as possible in scent to the main  source of nectar at any particular season of the year.    In preparing these scents, take an ounce of the oil you may prefer,  put it into a pint bottle and fill bottle one-fourth full of  alcohol; let it stand a few days and then fill up with water. This  would make sufficient scent to last any one for several years. A  small vial can be filled and taken along--even an ounce vial will  last several trips; or a few drops of the oil can be put into a  bottle and water added, but as water will not cut the oil, it  remains insoluble and when the bottle is turned in order that the  mixture will run out, it often happens that our scent (after using  a time or two) is no good, the oil having disappeared. But by  cutting the scent with alcohol, the last drop will be just as  strongly scented as the first.    I have used about all the different scents known to bee hunters and  oil of anise was my standby for many years. I found bergamont to be  good. Horse mint, goldenrod, and many other oils and scents were  used at some particular time of the year, but the most powerful and  lasting scent I ever used was oil of sweet clover. Having run out  of the oil and not knowing where to get it without sending to some  drug house, I bought a toilet preparation labled \"essence of sweet  clover,\" and found it filled the bill. A few drops were spilled on  my sleeve and in going on a course this was all that was needed. If  I stopped but a moment, my arm was covered with bees.    I don't advocate the use of the hunting-box for bee hunting. I  tried them long ago and found the method slow and uncertain. In  carrying my box from one location to another and releasing the  imprisoned bees I would always see them circle around and light on  a leaf and consume from five minutes to a half hour in cleaning  themselves up and when they did depart, there was no assurance that  they would come back. However, some hunters must meet with better  success than I have had in hunting by the box method, and to those  I would say, if bringing the bees to your box is what you want,  just rub a few drops of the oil of sweet clover on the side of your  box and that part of finding the bee is done.    It is hardly necessary to say more about baits. My views have been  given in the earlier chapters on bee hunting. A few drops of pure  honey is perhaps the best that can be used in starting the bees on  bait, but as soon as several have loaded with the honey, sprinkle  your bunch of bushes which you intend to carry on the course with a  bait made by filling a bottle one-fourth full of pure granulated  sugar, then a little honey and filling the bottle up with water.  This will make the bait sweet enough and it will not become so  sticky as if more sugar or honey were used.        CHAPTER X.    CUTTING THE TREE AND TRANSFERRING.    I hope those who read this book may find something in its pages  that will be beneficial. In your excursions through the forests you  are unconsciously getting the benefit of the greatest source in the  world of physical perfection--God's pure air--and, at the same time  there are no reasons why one with reasonable tact cannot be  benefited financially.    When should a bee tree be cut and transferred to the hive? There is  a difference of opinion in regard to the time of the year and also  to the manner in which it should be done. I respect the opinions of  those who have expressed themselves on the subject, but after  trying nearly all the methods described I found nothing in them  that came up to my ideal of a perfect plan of transferring the bee  from the tree to the hive.    My first plan was to cut the tree and, if not too large, saw it off  both above and below the bees, keep them in with smoke, and tack  screen over the place of entrance. Then hire someone to help carry  it home. It was set up on end and left to take care of itself and  if a swarm would issue from it and we were successful in hiving it  in the old box hive (the kind mostly in use in my boyhood days), we  thought the last chapter of bee-keeping had been learned. Then,  after the movable frame hive came into use the tree would be cut,  the bees drove into a box, the honey taken from the tree and with a  few pieces of brood all was taken home. The small bits of comb were  tied in the central frames for the bees to cluster on and the bees  shaken from the box in front of the hive. This plan was certainly  superior to the first mentioned but had one serious drawback--the  brood that was in the tree was left to perish.    After seeing the serious defects in the described methods, my next  move was to take a hive with me on going to cut the tree. All comb  containing brood was placed in the frames, the bees run into the  hive, which was left at the tree for a week or more in order that  the bees might have all the combs joined to the frames, and then  brought home. This was another advance in the method of  transferring, for the thousands of young bees about to emerge from  their cells were saved, and the colony having its brood and  strength undiminished should be able to fill at least one super of  honey besides all stores needed for themselves. Taking it for  granted that we cut the bee in the early part of the summer, one  super would be a low estimate, but even this would pay all expenses  connected with the cutting, buying a hive and fixtures, and as the  bee is now in an ideal hive we can hopefully look forward to the  next year when our profits are coming in.    There could be other plans given, some of them having virtue, but I  will now lay a plan before the reader which if followed will prove  more remunerative, and with less expense, than the former methods.  To carry a hive and tools necessary to cut a bee tree will require  the service of an assistant and when, after a week or so, we return  to bring the bee home, more help is needed. A man is worthy of his  hire and of course is paid. Carrying a hive over rough and uneven  ground is hard work. So by the time we have the bee home and sum  the matter up, the financial part of bee hunting don't impress us  very strongly.    I have been in the habit of hunting bees during the fall months,  but if I need a day's outing, no month from early spring, until  late fall fails to find me on my tramps through the forest in  search of a bee tree. No difference what time of the year I find my  bee nor how many may be found in any particular season, they are  always left stand over winter and cut the following spring, but not  before May, for I want the bee to be strong in bee with abundance  of brood. About this time of year I take a box eight inches square  at the end and two feet in length. Over the one end some wire  screen is nailed and a lid, the center being cut out and replaced  with wire screen, serves as a covering for the other end.    With bucket, ax, and this box we will go to the tree, cut it, being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34063"],[0,"Fifty Years a Hunter and Trapper (#5)"],[1,"and was high and broad enough for one end of the shanty  and there was a fine spring close by. Mr. Harris pointed to the rock  and said that there we had one end of our camp already as well as a  good start towards the fire place.    He told me to begin the cutting of logs for the other two sides and  the other end. We cut the logs a suitable size to handle well and  about twelve and fourteen feet long. Mr. Harris did the planning  while I did the heavy part of the work.    That night we slept under a hemlock tree and were up the next morning  and had breakfast before daylight and ready for the day's work. We  could see scuds of clouds away off in the southwest which Mr. Harris  said did not show well for us. He had brought a good crosscut saw and  it was not long until we had logs enough cut to put up the sides,  about four feet high and logs for one end. We hauled the logs all up  with the horse so they would be handy. Then we began the work of  notching and putting up the logs.    About noon a drizzling rain started and kept it up all the afternoon.  We covered our provisions and blankets the best we could to keep them  dry and continued to work on the camp. We got the body up, the  rafters and a part of the roof on. We put up a ridge roof as Mr.  Harris said it would not be necessary to have the sides quite so high  with a steep ridge roof. We got our supplies under shelter and had a  dry place to sleep that night. It was still raining in the morning  but we continued to work on the camp like beavers all day and we got  shakes split from a pine stub to finish the roof and chinking blocks  to chink between the logs.    The next morning Mr. Harris said that he would go and take the horse  out to a farm house that was about six miles out the turnpike, known  as the Widow Herod Place, or better known as Aunt Bettie. Mr. Harris  said he would go while there was food enough to last the old horse a  day or two until we were ready to use him. Then I knew that the old  horse was doomed to be used for bear bait.    When Mr. Harris started away with the horse he cautioned me not to go  off hunting, but to stick to work on the shanty which I did like a  \"nailer.\" When Mr. Harris returned I had the roof on, the chinking  all in and the gable end boarded up with shakes and all ready to  begin calking and mudding. It was some time in the afternoon when he  got back and after looking over the shack to see what I had done he  said that he thought I had done so well that I was entitled to a play  spell and suggested that we take our guns and go down along the side  of the hill and see if we could kill a deer, remarking that we could  use a little venison if we had it. He told me to go up onto the bench  near the top of the hill while he would take the lower bench and he  would hunt the side hill along down the stream until dark.    Mr. Harris had a single barrel gun with a barrel three or four feet  long which he called Sudden Death, and it weighed twelve or fourteen  pounds. As for me I had my new double barrel gun which I have  mentioned before. We had not gone far until I heard the report of a  gun below me and soon I heard Mr. Harris \"ho-ho-hoa,\" and I hurried  to where the howling came from and found him already taking the  entrails out of a small doe. I suggested to Mr. Harris that we take  the deer down to the creek before we dressed it and that by so doing  we probably could catch a mink or coon with the entrails. He  consented to do so and after we had taken out the entrails Mr. Harris  noticed a fine place to catch a fox or some other animal and pointed  to a large tree that had fallen across the stream.    The tree had broken in two at the bank, on the side of the stream  where we were. The water had swung the trunk of the tree down the  stream until there was a space of three or four feet between the end  of the tree and the bank. Mr. Harris took a part of the offal from  the deer and carried it across to the opposite bank and placed the  remainder on the side where we were. He then placed an old limb for a  drag to the trap at the place where he wanted to set the trap. As we  had no traps with us we went to camp and early the next morning we  took two traps and went to this place and set them.    We put in that day finishing the camp, putting in the door and fixing  the chimney to the fireplace and calking all the cracks between the  logs and mudded tight between the logs and all the joints. Now the  camp being completed we began setting the bear traps. The old horse  was taken onto a chestnut ridge and shot, cut up into small pieces  suitable for bear bait, and hung up in small saplings such as we  could bend down. After the bait was fastened to the tree we let it  spring up so as to keep it out of the reach of any animal until we  had a trap set.    The way Mr. Harris set a bear trap was to build a V shaped pen about  three feet long and about the same in height, place the bait in the  back end of the pen and set the trap in the entrance. We had eleven  bear traps and after they were all set on different ridges where  bears were most likely to travel, we began the work of setting the  small traps which was not a long job, as we had only about forty.    The next morning Mr. Harris said that I had better go down and see if  the traps we had set had been disturbed and he said that he would  rest while I was gone.    When I came in sight of the traps I could see a fox bounding around  in one of the traps. I could see on looking at the trap we had placed  across the creek that the drag had been moved closer to the log but I  could see nothing moving. I cut a stick and killed the fox when I  crossed over to see what was in the other trap and to my disgust  there was a skunk. I was not particularly in love with skunks in  those days, for while they scented just as loud at that time as now  they were vastly lacking in the money value. I took hold of the clog  and carefully dragged the skunk to the creek and sank him in the  water. I now went back to the other side of the creek and set the fox  trap and when I had the trap set the skunk was good and dead. I reset  the trap and took the fox and skunk to camp without skinning. When I  got to camp I found Mr. Harris busy making stretching boards of  different sizes for different animals from shakes that we had left  when covering the roof. Mr. Harris laughed and said that he knew that  we would need them when I got back. The fox and skunk were skinned,  stretched and hung up on the outside of the gable of the shack, and  that was the starting point of our catch of the season.    We set the most of our small traps along the streams for foxes and  mink, taking a few to the ridges to set in likely places to catch a  fox, and at thick laurel patches where we were likely to catch a wild  cat as there was a bounty of $2 on them.    After the small steel traps were set we began building a line of  deadfalls for marten and fisher. After the deadfalls were built we  divided our time between hunting deer and tending the traps.    We caught three bears, two fisher, which were very scarce, as I do  not think that fishers were ever very plentiful in this state, a good  bunch of marten, foxes, four or five wildcats and killed twenty-two  deer. The last days of December Mr. Harris said that we would prepare  to go home as the deer season closed the first of January. Although  the law gave until the fifteenth to get your deer we had dragged the  most of ours up to the Bailey Mill at various times. We got all those  around the mill and sent them to Jersey Shore by freight teams to the  railroad, then shipped them to New York. We got 15 cents for saddles  and 10 cents for the whole deer.    Mr. Harris had brought an auger with him so that he could make a  sleigh to go home with and from birch saplings we made one and on the  thirteenth of January I went and got the horse. He was as fat as a  pig and felt like a colt. We hitched him up to the sleigh and got our  stuff up to the Bailey Mill where we loaded the wagon onto the sleigh  and piled on the furs and the rest of our outfit and early on the  morning of the fourteenth we started for home. This ended my first  real experience as a hunter and trapper.    I received two or three letters from Mr. Harris, the last one in  which he stated that he was not feeling very well and I never heard  from him again.        CHAPTER IV.    Some Early Experiences.    In 1871 or 1872 I had several bear traps made by our local blacksmith  and I started in as a bear trapper and went it alone. After being out  with Mr. Harris I had taken some valuable lessons on trapping bear  and other animals. I built a good log camp on the West Branch of Pine  Creek and went to trapping and hunting without either partner or  companion, but after being in camp the first season I bought a  shepherd dog that was a year old and broke him for still hunting and  trapping. I found that a good intelligent dog was not only a  companion but also a valuable one. I have noticed that some trappers  do not want a dog on the trap line with them, claiming that the dog  is a nuisance. This is because the dog was not properly trained.    To get back to the bear trapping: In the locality where I was  trapping, bear were not very plentiful except in season, when there  was a crop of beechnuts, although there was but little other shack,  such as chestnuts and acorns. However, some seasons there would be an  abundance of black cherries which the bears are very fond of. I set  three traps at the head of a broad basin where there were three or  four springs and the next day I set the balance of my bear traps;  then I built a few deadfalls for coons and set a few steel traps for  fox.    As I had seen several fresh bear tracks crossing the stream, where I  had been setting the coon traps, on the morning of the third day  after I had set the first three bear traps, I thought that I would go"]]]
