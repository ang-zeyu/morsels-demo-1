When this last is the case they go down into  the haunts of evil, seek out the wretched, and spare neither themselves  nor their money in their Christ-like enthusiasm for humanity. But the  luxury of doing good is by no means confined to the celibate. On the  contrary, the man with a wife and children in whose goodness and  happiness he rejoices may be much better prepared to aid and sympathize  with the erring and the suffering. The flood-gates of his affections may  have been opened, and he may have become receptive to influences which  had upon him beforetime little or no effect.    Not a few good and great men have confessed that they were marriage-made  to a very considerable extent. The following testimony was given by De  Tocqueville in a letter to a friend: \"I cannot describe to you the  happiness yielded in the long run by the habitual society of a woman, in  whose soul all that is good in your own is reflected naturally, and even  improved. When I say or do a thing which seems to me to be perfectly  right, I read immediately in Marie's countenance an expression of proud  satisfaction which elevates me; and so when my conscience reproaches me  her face instantly clouds over. Although I have great power over her  mind, I see with pleasure that she awes me; and so long as I love her as  I do now I am sure that I shall never allow myself to be drawn into  anything that is wrong.\"    Many a man has been shown the pathway to heaven by his wife's practice  of piety. \"My mercy,\" says Bunyan, \"was to light upon a wife whose  father and mother were accounted godly. This woman and I, though we came  together as poor as poor might be (not having so much household stuff as  a dish or a spoon betwixt us both), yet she had for her part 'The Plain  Man's Pathway to Heaven' and 'The Practice of Piety,' which her father  had left her when he died.\" By reading these and other good books,  helped by the kindly influence of his wife, Bunyan was gradually  reclaimed from his evil ways, and led gently into the way of  righteousness.    Nor does this companionship of good wives, which enables men to gain \"in  sweetness and in moral height,\" cause them in the least degree to lose  \"the wrestling thews which throw the world.\" Quite the reverse. Weak men  have displayed real public virtue, and strong men have been made  stronger, because they had by their side a woman of noble character, who  exercised a fortifying influence on their conduct. Lady Rachel Russell  is one of the many celebrated women who have encouraged their husbands  to suffer and be strong. She sat beside her husband day after day during  his public trial, taking notes and doing everything to help him.    In the sixth year of his marriage Baxter was brought before the  magistrates for holding a conventicle, and was sentenced to be confined  in Clerkenwell Gaol. There he was joined by his wife, who  affectionately nursed him during his imprisonment. \"She was never so  cheerful a companion to me,\" he says, \"as in prison, and was very much  against me seeking to be released.\"    There is a sort of would-be wit which consists in jesting at the  supposed bondage of the married state. The best answer to this plentiful  lack of wit is the fact that some of the best of men have kissed the  shackles which a wife imposes, and have either thought or said, \"If this  be slavery, who'd be free?\" Luther, speaking of his wife, said, \"I would  not exchange my poverty with her for all the riches of Croesus without  her.\" In more recent times the French statesman, M. Guizot, says in his  \"Memoires\": \"What I know to-day, at the end of my race, I have felt when  it began, and during its continuance. Even in the midst of great  undertakings domestic affections form the basis of life, and the most  brilliant career has only superficial and incomplete enjoyments if a  stranger to the happy ties of family and friendship.\" Not long ago, when  speaking of his wife, Prince Bismarck said, \"She it is who has made me  what I am.\"    And there have been English statesmen who could say quite as much. Burke  was sustained amid the anxiety and agitation of public life by domestic  felicity. \"Every care vanishes,\" he said, \"the moment I enter under my  own roof!\" Of his wife he said that she was \"not made to be the  admiration of everybody, but the happiness of one.\" A writer in a recent  number of _Leisure Hour_ relates the following of Lord Beaconsfield:  \"The grateful affection which he entertained for his wife, whom he  always esteemed as the founder of his fortunes, is well known. She was  in the habit of travelling with him on almost all occasions. A friend  of the earl and of the narrator of the incident was dining with him,  when one of the party--a Member of the House for many years, of a noble  family, but rather remarkable for raising a laugh at his buffoonery than  any admiration for his wisdom--had no better taste or grace than to  expostulate with Disraeli for always taking the viscountess with him. 'I  cannot understand it,' said the graceless man, 'for, you know, you make  yourself a perfect laughing-stock wherever your wife goes with you.'  Disraeli fixed his eyes upon him very expressively and said, 'I don't  suppose you can understand it, B.--I don't suppose you can understand  it, for no one could ever in the last and wildest excursions of an  insane imagination suppose you to be guilty of gratitude!'\"    It is true that there have been memorable celibates, but in the main the  world's work has been done by the married. Fame and reward are powerful  incentives, but they bear no comparison to the influence exercised by  affection.    A man's wife and family often compel him to do his best; and, when on  the point of despairing, they force him to fight like a hero, not for  himself, but for them. Curran confessed that when he addressed a court  for the first time, if he had not felt his wife and children tugging at  his gown, he would have thrown up his brief and relinquished the  profession of a lawyer.    \"It is often the case when you see a great man, like a ship, sailing  proudly along the current of renown, that there is a little tug--his  wife--whom you cannot see, but who is directing his movements and  supplying the motive power.\" This truth is well illustrated by the  anecdote told of Lord Eldon, who, when he had received the Great Seal at  the hands of the king, being about to retire, was addressed by his  majesty with the words, \"Give my remembrance to Lady Eldon.\" The  Chancellor, in acknowledging the condescension, intimated his ignorance  of Lady Eldon's claim to such a notice. \"Yes, yes,\" the king answered;  \"I know how much I owe to Lady Eldon. I know that you would have made  yourself a country curate, and that she has made you my Lord  Chancellor.\" Sir Walter Scott and Daniel O'Connell, at a late period of  their lives, ascribed their success in the world principally to their  wives.    When Sir Joshua Reynolds--himself a bachelor--met the sculptor Flaxman  shortly after his marriage, he said to him, \"So, Flaxman, I am told you  are married; if so, sir, I tell you you are ruined for an artist.\"  Flaxman went home, sat down beside his wife, took her hand in his, and  said, \"Ann, I am ruined for an artist.\" \"How so, John? How has it  happened? and who has done it?\" \"It happened,\" he replied, \"in the  church, and Ann Denman has done it.\" He then told her of Sir Joshua's  remark--whose opinion was well known, and had often been expressed, that  if students would excel they must bring the whole powers of their mind  to bear upon their art, from the moment they rose until they went to  bed; and also, that no man could be a _great_ artist unless he studied  the grand works of Raphael, Michael Angelo, and others, at Rome and  Florence. \"And I,\" said Flaxman, drawing up his little figure to its  full height, \"_I_ would be a great artist.\" \"And a great artist you  shall be,\" said his wife, \"and visit Rome, too, if that be really  necessary to make you great.\" \"But how?\" asked Flaxman. \"_Work and  economize_,\" rejoined the brave wife; \"I will never have it said that  Ann Denman ruined John Flaxman for an artist.\" And so it was determined  by the pair that the journey to Rome was to be made when their means  would admit. \"I will go to Rome,\" said Flaxman, \"and show the President  that wedlock is for a man's good rather than his harm; and you, Ann,  shall accompany me.\"    After working for five years, aided by the untiring economy of his wife,  Flaxman actually did accomplish his journey. On returning from Rome,  where he spent seven years, conscious of his indebtedness to his wife,  he devised an original gift as a memorial of his domestic happiness. He  caused a little quarto book to be made, containing some score or so of  leaves, and with pen and pencil proceeded to fill and embellish it. On  the first page is drawn a dove with an olive branch in her mouth; an  angel is on the right and an angel on the left, and between is written,  \"To Ann Flaxman\"; below, two hands are clasped as at an altar, two  cherubs bear a garland, and there follows an inscription to his wife  introducing the subject. Instead of finding his genius maimed by his  alliance with Ann Denman, this eminent sculptor was ever ready to  acknowledge that his subsequent success was in a great part  marriage-made.    It was through the eyes of his wife that Huber, the great authority on  bees, who was blind from his seventeenth year, conducted his  observations and studies. He even went so far as to declare that he  should be miserable were he to regain his eyesight. \"I should not know,\"  he said, \"to what extent a person in my situation could be beloved;  besides, to me my wife is always young, fresh, and pretty, which is no  light matter.\"    Sir William Hamilton of Edinburgh found his wife scarcely less helpful,  especially after he had been stricken by paralysis through overwork."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35542"],[0,"House Rats and Mice (#5)"],[1,"ions. Directions for preparing and using the gas  may be found in a publication entitled Hydrocyanic-acid Gas against  Household Insects, by Dr. L. O. Howard and Charles H. Popenoe.[8]    Carbon monoxid is rather dangerous, as its presence in the hold of a  vessel or other compartment is not manifest to the senses, and fatal  accidents have occurred during its employment to fumigate vessels.    Chlorin gas has a strong bleaching action upon textile fabrics, and for  this reason can not be used in many situations.    Sulphur dioxid also has a bleaching effect upon textiles, but less  marked than that of chlorin, and ordinarily it is not noticeable with  the small percentage of the gas it is necessary to use. On the whole,  this gas has many advantages as a fumigator and disinfectant. It is used  also as a fire extinguisher on board vessels. Special furnaces for  generating the gas and forcing it into the compartments of ships and  buildings are on the market, and many steamships and docks are now  fitted with the necessary apparatus.      RAT VIRUSES.    Several microorganisms, or bacteria, found originally in diseased rats  or mice, have been exploited for destroying rats. A number of these  so-called rat viruses are on the American market. The Biological Survey,  the Bureau of Animal Industry, and the United States Public Health  Service have made careful investigations and practical tests of these  viruses, mostly with negative results. The cultures tested by the  Biological Survey have not proved satisfactory.    The chief defects to be overcome before the cultures can be recommended  for general use are:    1. The virulence is not great enough to kill a sufficiently high  percentage of rats that eat food containing the microorganisms.    2. The virulence decreases with the age of the cultures. They  deteriorate in warm weather and in bright sunlight.    3. The diseases resulting from the microorganisms are not contagious and  do not spread by contact of diseased with healthy animals.    4. The comparative cost of the cultures is too great for general use.  Since they have no advantages over the common poisons, except that they  are usually harmless to man and other animals, they should be equally  cheap; but their actual cost is much greater. Moreover, considering the  skill and care necessary in their preparation, it is doubtful if the  cost can be greatly reduced.    The Department of Agriculture, therefore, does not prepare, use, or  recommend the use of rat viruses.      NATURAL ENEMIES OF RATS AND MICE.    Among the natural enemies of rats and mice are the larger hawks and  owls, skunks, foxes, coyotes, weasels, minks, dogs, cats, and ferrets.    Probably the greatest factor in the increase of rats, mice, and other  destructive rodents in the United States has been the persistent killing  off of the birds and mammals that prey upon them. Animals that on the  whole are decidedly beneficial, since they subsist upon harmful insects  and rodents, are habitually destroyed by some farmers and sportsmen  because they occasionally kill a chicken or a game bird.    The value of carnivorous mammals and the larger birds of prey in  destroying rats and mice should be more fully recognized, especially by  the farmer and the game preserver. Rats actually destroy more poultry  and game, both eggs and young chicks, than all the birds and wild  mammals combined; yet some of their enemies among our most useful birds  of prey and carnivorous mammals are persecuted almost to the point of  extinction. An enlightened public sentiment should cause the repeal of  all bounties on these animals and afford protection to the majority of  them.          ORGANIZED EFFORTS TO DESTROY RATS.      The necessity of cooperation and organization in the work of rat  destruction is of the utmost importance. To destroy all the animals on  the premises of a single farmer in a community has little permanent  value, since they are soon replaced from near-by farms. If, however, the  farmers of an entire township or county unite in efforts to get rid of  rats, much more lasting results may be attained. If continued from year  to year, such organized efforts are very effective.      COMMUNITY EFFORTS.    Cooperative efforts to destroy rats have taken various forms in  different localities. In cities, municipal employees have occasionally  been set at work hunting rats from their retreats, with at least  temporary benefit to the community. Thus, in 1904, at Folkestone,  England, a town of about 25,000 inhabitants, the corporation employees,  helped by dogs, in three days killed 1,645 rats.    Side hunts in which rats are the only animals that count in the contest  have sometimes been organized and successfully carried out. At New  Burlington, Ohio, a rat hunt took place some years ago in which each of  the two sides killed over 8,000 rats, the beaten party serving a banquet  to the winners.    There is danger that organized rat hunts will be followed by long  intervals of indifference and inaction. This may be prevented by  offering prizes covering a definite period of effort. Such prizes  accomplish more than municipal bounties, because they secure a friendly  rivalry which stimulates the contestants to do their utmost to win.    In England and some of its colonies contests for prizes have been  organized to promote the destruction of the English, or house, sparrow,  but many of the so-called sparrow clubs are really sparrow and rat  clubs, for the destruction of both pests is the avowed object of the  organizations. A sparrow club in Kent, England, accomplished the  destruction of 28,000 sparrows and 16,000 rats in three seasons by the  annual expenditure of but L6 ($29.20) in prize money. Had ordinary  bounties been paid for this destruction, the tax on the community would  have been about L250 (over $1,200).    Many organizations already formed should be interested in destroying  rats. Boards of trade, civic societies, and citizens' associations in  towns and farmers' and women's clubs in rural communities will find the  subject of great importance. Women's municipal leagues in several large  cities already have taken up the matter. The league in Baltimore  recently secured appropriations of funds for expenditure in fighting  mosquitoes, flies, and rats. The league in Boston during the past year,  supported by voluntary contributions for the purpose, made a highly  creditable educational campaign against rats. Boys' corn clubs, the  troops of Boy Scouts, and similar organizations could do excellent work  in rat campaigns.      STATE AND NATIONAL AID.    To secure permanent results any general campaign for the elimination of  rats must aim at _building the animals out of shelter and food_.  Building reforms depend on municipal ordinances and legislative  enactments. The recent plague eradication work of the United States  Public Health Service in San Francisco, Seattle, New Orleans, and at  various places in Hawaii and Porto Rico required such ordinances and  laws as well as financial aid in prosecuting the work. The campaign of  Danish and Swedish organizations for the destruction of rats had the  help of governmental appropriations. The legislatures of California,  Texas, Indiana, and Hawaii have in recent years passed laws or made  appropriations to aid in rat riddance. It is probable that  well-organized efforts of communities would soon win legislative support  everywhere. Communities should not postpone efforts, however, while  waiting for legislative cooperation, but should at once organize and  begin repressive operations. Wherever health is threatened the Public  Health Service of the United States can cooperate, and where crops and  other products are endangered the Bureau of Biological Survey of the  Department of Agriculture is ready to assist by advice and in  demonstration of methods.          IMPORTANT REPRESSIVE MEASURES.      The measures needed for repressing and eliminating rats and mice include  the following:    1. The requirement that all new buildings erected shall be made  rat-proof under competent inspection.    2. That all existing rat-proof buildings shall be closed against rats  and mice by having all openings accessible to the animals, from  foundation to roof, closed or screened by door, window, grating, or  meshed wire netting.    3. That all buildings not of rat-proof construction shall be made so by  remodeling, by the use of materials that may not be pierced by rats, or  by elevation.    4. The protection of our native hawks, owls, and smaller predatory  mammals--the natural enemies of rats.    5. Greater cleanliness about markets, grocery stores, warehouses,  courts, alleys, stables, and vacant lots in cities and villages, and  like care on farms and suburban premises. This includes the storage of  waste and garbage in tightly covered vessels and the prompt disposal of  it each day.    6. Care in the construction of drains and sewers, so as not to provide  entrance and retreat for rats. Old brick sewers in cities should be  replaced by concrete or tile.    7. The early threshing and marketing of grains on farms, so that stacks  and mows shall not furnish harborage and food for rats.    8. Removal of outlying straw stacks and piles of trash or lumber that  harbor rats in fields and vacant lots.    9. The keeping of provisions, seed grain, and foodstuffs in rat-proof  containers.    10. Keeping effective rat dogs, especially on farms and in city  warehouses.    11. The systematic destruction of rats, whenever and wherever possible,  by (_a_) trapping, (_b_) poisoning, and (_c_) organized hunts.    12. The organization of clubs and other societies for systematic warfare  against rats.
