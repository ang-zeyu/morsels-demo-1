That's the  watchword. Quiet efficiency.\"    \"I hope you are going to let the hens hatch some of the eggs, dear,\"  said Mrs. Ukridge. \"I should love to have some little chickens.\"    \"Of course. By all means. My idea,\" said Ukridge, \"was this. These  people will send us fifty fowls of sorts. That means--call it  forty-five eggs a day. Let 'em ... Well, I'm hanged! There's that dog  again. Where's the jug?\"    But this time an unforeseen interruption prevented the manoeuvre being  the success it had been before. I had turned the handle and was about  to pull the door open, while Ukridge, looking like some modern and  dilapidated version of the _Discobolus_, stood beside me with his jug  poised, when a voice spoke from the window.    \"Stand still!\" said the voice, \"or I'll corpse you!\"    I dropped the handle. Ukridge dropped the jug. Mrs. Ukridge dropped her  tea-cup. At the window, with a double-barrelled gun in his hands, stood  a short, square, red-headed man. The muzzle of his gun, which rested on  the sill, was pointing in a straight line at the third button of my  waistcoat.    Ukridge emitted a roar like that of a hungry lion.    \"Beale! You scoundrelly, unprincipled, demon! What the devil are you  doing with that gun? Why were you out? What have you been doing? Why  did you shout like that? Look what you've made me do.\"    He pointed to the floor. The very old pair of tennis shoes which he  wore were by this time generously soaked with the spilled water.    \"Lor, Mr. Ukridge, sir, is that you?\" said the red-headed man calmly.  \"I thought you was burglars.\"    A short bark from the other side of the kitchen door, followed by a  renewal of the scratching, drew Mr. Beale's attention to his faithful  hound.    \"That's Bob,\" he said.    \"I don't know what you call the brute,\" said Ukridge. \"Come in and tie  him up. And mind what you're doing with that gun. After you've finished  with the dog, I should like a brief chat with you, laddie, if you can  spare the time and have no other engagements.\"    Mr. Beale, having carefully deposited the gun against the wall and  dropped a pair of very limp rabbits on the floor, proceeded to climb in  through the window. This operation concluded, he stood to one side  while the besieged garrison passed out by the same route.    \"You will find me in the garden,\" said Ukridge coldly. \"I've one or two  little things to say to you.\"    Mr. Beale grinned affably. He seemed to be a man of equable temperament.    The cool air of the garden was grateful after the warmth of the  kitchen. It was a pretty garden, or would have been if it had not been  so neglected. I seemed to see myself sitting in a deck-chair on the  lawn, smoking and looking through the trees at the harbour below. It  was a spot, I felt, in which it would be an easy and a pleasant task to  shape the plot of my novel. I was glad I had come. About now, outside  my lodgings in town, a particularly foul barrel-organ would be settling  down to work.    \"Oh, there you are, Beale,\" said Ukridge, as the servitor appeared.  \"Now then, what have you to say?\"    The hired man looked thoughtful for a moment, then said that it was a  fine evening.    \"Fine evening?\" shouted Ukridge. \"What on earth has that got to do with  it? I want to know why you and Mrs. Beale were out when we arrived.\"    \"The missus went to Axminster, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    \"She had no right to go to Axminster. It isn't part of her duties to go  gadding about to Axminster. I don't pay her enormous sums to go to  Axminster. You knew I was coming this evening.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"What!\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Beale,\" said Ukridge with studied calm, the strong man repressing  himself. \"One of us two is a fool.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Let us sift this matter to the bottom. You got my letter?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"My letter saying that I should arrive to-day. You didn't get it?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Now, look here, Beale, this is absurd. I am certain that that letter  was posted. I remember placing it in my pocket for that purpose. It is  not there now. See. These are all the contents of my--well, I'm hanged.\"    He stood looking at the envelope which he had produced from his  breast-pocket. A soft smile played over Mr. Beale's wooden face. He  coughed.    \"Beale,\" said Ukridge, \"you--er--there seems to have been a mistake.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You are not so much to blame as I thought.\"    \"No, sir.\"    There was a silence.    \"Anyhow,\" said Ukridge in inspired tones, \"I'll go and slay that  infernal dog. I'll teach him to tear my door to pieces. Where's your  gun, Beale?\"    But better counsels prevailed, and the proceedings closed with a cold  but pleasant little dinner, at which the spared mongrel came out  unexpectedly strong with ingenious and diverting tricks.        CHAPTER V    BUCKLING TO    Sunshine, streaming into my bedroom through the open window, woke me  next day as distant clocks were striking eight. It was a lovely  morning, cool and fresh. The grass of the lawn, wet with dew, sparkled  in the sun. A thrush, who knew all about early birds and their  perquisites, was filling in the time before the arrival of the worm  with a song or two, as he sat in the bushes. In the ivy a colony of  sparrows were opening the day with brisk scuffling. On the gravel in  front of the house lay the mongrel, Bob, blinking lazily.    The gleam of the sea through the trees turned my thoughts to bathing. I  dressed quickly and went out. Bob rose to meet me, waving an absurdly  long tail. The hatchet was definitely buried now. That little matter of  the jug of water was forgotten.    A walk of five minutes down the hill brought me, accompanied by Bob, to  the sleepy little town. I passed through the narrow street, and turned  on to the beach, walking in the direction of the combination of pier  and break-water which loomed up through the faint mist.    The tide was high, and, leaving my clothes to the care of Bob, who  treated them as a handy bed, I dived into twelve feet of clear, cold  water. As I swam, I compared it with the morning tub of London, and  felt that I had done well to come with Ukridge to this pleasant spot.  Not that I could rely on unbroken calm during the whole of my visit. I  knew nothing of chicken-farming, but I was certain that Ukridge knew  less. There would be some strenuous moments before that farm became a  profitable commercial speculation. At the thought of Ukridge toiling on  a hot afternoon to manage an undisciplined mob of fowls, I laughed, and  swallowed a generous mouthful of salt water; and, turning, swam back to  Bob and my clothes.    On my return, I found Ukridge, in his shirt sleeves and minus a collar,  assailing a large ham. Mrs. Ukridge, looking younger and more  child-like than ever in brown holland, smiled at me over the tea-pot.    \"Hullo, old horse,\" bellowed Ukridge, \"where have you been? Bathing?  Hope it's made you feel fit for work, because we've got to buckle to  this morning.\"    \"The fowls have arrived, Mr. Garnet,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, opening her  eyes till she looked like an astonished kitten. \"_Such_ a lot of them.  They're making such a noise.\"    To support her statement there floated in through the window a cackling  which for volume and variety beat anything I had ever heard. Judging  from the noise, it seemed as if England had been drained of fowls and  the entire tribe of them dumped into the yard of Ukridge's farm.    \"There seems to have been no stint,\" I said.    \"Quite a goodish few, aren't there?\" said Ukridge complacently. \"But  that's what we want. No good starting on a small scale. The more you  have, the bigger the profits.\"    \"What sorts have you got mostly?\" I asked, showing a professional  interest.    \"Oh, all sorts. My theory, laddie, is this. It doesn't matter a bit  what kind we get, because they'll all lay; and if we sell settings of  eggs, which we will, we'll merely say it's an unfortunate accident if  they turn out mixed when hatched. Bless you, people don't mind what  breed a fowl is, so long as it's got two legs and a beak. These dealer  chaps were so infernally particular. 'Any Dorkings?' they said. 'All  right,' I said, 'bring on your Dorkings.' 'Or perhaps you will require  a few Minorcas?' 'Very well,' I said, 'unleash the Minorcas.' They were  going on--they'd have gone on for hours--but I stopped 'em. 'Look here,  my dear old college chum,' I said kindly but firmly to the manager  johnny--decent old buck, with the manners of a marquess,--'look here,'  I said, 'life is short, and we're neither of us as young as we used to  be. Don't let us waste the golden hours playing guessing games. I want  fowls. You sell fowls. So give me some of all sorts. Mix 'em up,  laddie,' I said, 'mix 'em up.' And he has, by jove. You go into the  yard and look at 'em. Beale has turned them out of their crates. There  must be one of every breed ever invented.\"    \"Where are you going to put them?\"    \"That spot we chose by the paddock. That's the place. Plenty of mud for  them to scratch about in, and they can go into the field when they feel  like it, and pick up worms, or whatever they feed on. We must rig them  up some sort of shanty, I suppose, this morning. We'll go and tell 'em  to send up some wire-netting and stuff from the town.\"    \"Then we shall want hen-coops. We shall have to make those.\"    \"Of course. So we shall. Millie, didn't I tell you that old Garnet was  the man to think of things. I forgot the coops. We can't buy some, I  suppose? On tick, of course.\"    \"Cheaper to make them. Suppose we get a lot of boxes. Sugar boxes are  as good as any. It won't take long to knock up a few coops.\"    Ukridge thumped the table with enthusiasm, upsetting his cup.    \"Garny, old horse, you're a marvel. You think of everything. We'll  buckle to right away, and get the whole place fixed up the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38290"],[0,"Speciation and Evolution of the Pygmy Mice, Genus Baiomys (#5)"],[1,"   |                 |           |           |           |           |    Total length |   77.0    |   92.6    |    97.6   |   99.9    |  101.6                 |  (74-79)  |  (89-96)  |   (91-103)| (93-105)  | (98-107)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Length       |   27.3    |   39.3    |   40.4    |   39.8    |   40.9    of tail      |  (24-29)  |  (37-41)  |  (36-43)  |  (35-45)  |  (38-45)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Length       |   49.6    |   53.3    |   57.0    |   60.0    |   60.7    of body      |  (49-50)  |  (52-55)  |  (51-61)  |  (56-67)  |  (57-67)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Length of    |    11.0   |     13.6  |   14.3    |   14.5    |   14.2    hind foot    |    (11)   |  (13-14)  |(13.5-15.0)|  (14-15)  |  (13-15)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Occipitonasal|   14.2    |    16.3   |   17.1    |   17.7    |   17.8    length       |(13.6-15.2)|(15.8-16.9)|(16.7-17.6)|(17.2-18.3)|(17.6-18.1)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Zygomatic    |    8.1    |    8.7    |    8.9    |    9.3    |    9.4    breadth      | (7.8-8.6) | (8.6-8.8) | (8.6-9.3) | (9.0-9.6) | (9.1-9.6)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Interorbital |    3.4    |    3.4    |    3.4    |    3.6    |    3.5    breadth      | (3.3-3.5) | (3.3-3.6) | (3.3-3.6) | (3.4-3.8) | (3.3-3.6)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Incisive     |           |           |           |           |    foramina     |     2.9   |    3.5    |    3.7    |    3.9    |    3.9    (length)     | (2.8-2.9) | (3.4-3.6) | (3.6-3.9) | (3.6-4.1) | (3.5-4.0)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Depth        |    5.9    |    6.5    |    6.5    |    6.7    |    6.8    of cranium   | (5.6-6.2) | (6.3-6.8) | (6.2-6.8) | (6.4-7.0) | (6.5-7.1)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Alveolar     |           |           |           |           |    length,      |    2.7    |    2.9    |    2.9    |    3.0    |    3.0    upper molars | (2.5-2.8) | (2.9-3.0) | (2.8-3.1) | (2.9-3.2) | (3.0-3.1)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Postpalatal  |    4.8    |    5.9    |    6.2    |    6.5    |    6.5    length       | (4.5-5.3) | (5.8-6.0) | (5.8-6.6) | (6.2-7.2) | (6.3-6.7)                 |           |           |           |           |                 |           |           |           |           |    Breadth      |    8.1    |    8.5    |    8.4    |    8.6    |   8.6    of braincase | (7.8-8.7) |   (8.5)   | (8.0-8.7) | (8.3-8.9) |(8.4-8.8)    -------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------      SECONDARY SEXUAL VARIATION    The method employed by Dice and Leraas (1936:2) was used to measure the  secondary sexual differences, if there were any, in each of several age  classes. As pointed out by Hooper (1952b:11), individual variation in  small samples can obscure secondary sexual differences. The samples of  _B. taylori_ from the vicinity (see page 595) of Altamira, Tamaulipas,  and the samples of _B. musculus_ from El Salvador (table 2) were large  enough to prevent individual variation from obscuring sexual  differences. Nevertheless, no significant secondary sexual differences  were found in either _B. taylori_ or _B. musculus_ (see table 2).

Clark (1941:298), Hoffmeister  (1951:16), and Van Gelder (1959:239) point out that external  measurements generally are more variable than measurements of  the cranium, probably because different techniques of measuring  are employed by different collectors. As can be noted in table 3,  females varied more than males.    In the 3520 specimens examined, an extra tooth was observed in  only one (see Hooper, 1955:298). The left mandibular tooth-row  of an adult male (USNM 71539) from Omentepec, Guerrero, is  worn more than the right one. Irregularities in number of teeth  and abnormalities in individual teeth seem to be rare in pygmy  mice.
