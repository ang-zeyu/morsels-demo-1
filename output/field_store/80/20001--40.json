[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#5)"],[1,"was a strange, eventful night in the den. All the country  round was silent as the grave, and the air of the June night was  soft and sweet as the petals of wild roses. The Mistress of the  Kennels was persuaded into going early to bed, but the Master sat  behind his big table, writing beneath a carefully shaded lamp, and  rising quietly every now and again, to peer over the top of the  high table in the direction of the big bed in the shadow, where  Tara lay. Many things happened in the meantime, but it was just  after the clock in the tower of the village church had struck the  hour of one, that the Master was thrilled by a cry from his beloved  Tara; the fifth he had heard during the past three and a half  hours.    He leaned forward on his elbows, waiting and listening. Tara had  never heard of duty or self-control. She was a pure child of  Nature. But the moment of that cry of hers was the only moment she  allowed for self-consideration, or the play of her own  inclinations. In the next moment she was busying herself, with the  most exquisite delicacy and precision, over the care of her latest  offspring; the last late-comer in her new family of five. In that  next instant, too, a weak, bleating little cry, a voice that was  not at all like Tara's, smote pleasantly upon the ears of the  Master, where he waited, peering watchfully from beside the deeply  shaded lamp on his table.    It was then, just after the Master heard that little bleating cry  which told of new life in the world, that Tara, with infinite care  and precaution, lowered her great bulk upon the bed in a coil--she  had been standing--the centre of which was occupied by four glossy  Irish Wolfhound puppies, who had arrived respectively at ten,  eleven, twelve, and half-past twelve that night. The four, then  blindly grovelling over the carpeted bed, were now perfectly  sheltered in the still heaving hollow of their mother's flank.  These comparatively world-worn pups had not arranged themselves  conveniently in a cluster to receive their loving mother's caress.  On the contrary, they were all groping in different directions at  the moment in which Tara's pain-racked body was lowered to rest,  and to shelter them. But, while yet that great body hung over them  in the act of descending, it had twisted and curved into the  required lines, and a soft muzzle had thrust this puppy that way,  and the other another way; the mother's soft, filmy eyes missing  nothing before her or behind. One inch of miscalculation, and the  life had been crushed out of one of those tiny creatures. But pain  brought no miscalculation for Tara.    One quick movement of her head satisfied the mother that her four  firstborn were safe and well disposed. Immediately then, with never  a thought of rest, her nose thrust the new-comer into position  between her fore-paws, and she proceeded to administer the  life-giving and stimulating tongue-wash. Over and over the little  shapeless grey form was turned, cheeping and bleating, until every  crevice of its soft anatomy had come under the vivifying sweep of  six inches of scarlet tongue, warm and tenderly rough. Then the  mother's sensitive nose thrust and coaxed the little creature to  its nesting-place under her flank, where three sisters and a  brother already nosed complainingly among milk-swollen dugs, quite  indifferent to the coming of an addition to their number, and  desiring they knew not what--desiring it lustily.    Then, and not till then, did the beautiful mother of these new-born  descendants of an ancient race permit herself to draw a long breath  of relief, and lower her massive head upon her fore-paws. A moment  later, and a desire which overcame weariness impelled Tara to part  her hot jaws, and glance in the direction of the shaded lamp. No  least movement of hers escaped the Master, and in the moment of her  glance, he came forward with a dish of fresh cold water in his  hand. The mother lapped, slowly, weakly, gratefully, thanking  whatever gods she knew, and the friend whose hand and eye were so  ready, for the balm of water. The man moved very gently and deftly  before her, and no anxiety came into her brown eyes when he leaned  forward to examine the now resting litter at her flank. But it had  gone hardly one fancied with the stranger, or even with the casual  acquaintance, who should have approached too inquisitively the  little family.    \"There, there, pet; all right, my Tara girl,\" murmured the man, as  he stepped back softly to his table, to return a moment later with  a dish of warm milk and water, which the slightly rested mother  drank with forethoughtful eagerness, though the effort necessary  for lapping in that constrained position, and without disturbing  the little ones beside her, was far from pleasant, and far enough  from personal inclination.    Ten minutes later the dam very gently changed her position, all  idea of rest having left her now, and proceeded systematically to  lick, first her own swollen dugs, and then the little featureless  faces of her offspring, with many small encouraging muzzle-thrusts  and undulations of her sinuous frame; while the Master (ready to  give assistance if that were required, but too knowledgeable in  these matters to wish to hasten Nature, or botch the delicate  handiwork of the mother) stood in the shadow of his big table,  watching and waiting. Within another few minutes the five pups were  immersed in the most important affair of life (from their point of  view) and, with wriggling tails and tiny, heaving flanks, with  impatient, out-thrust, pink fore-feet, wet faces, and gaping little  jaws, were nursing in a row like clock-work.    The mother turned a proud, filmy eye in the direction of her  friend, the Master, and allowed her massive head to fall on its  side, her whole great form outstretched to reap the benefit of a  few more minutes of needed repose.    \"Good girl!\" whispered the Master; and stepping backward, he turned  yet lower than it was the wick of his shaded lamp. \"Good!  Excellent! Five's a very good number. I should have been sorry to  see a big litter, for dear old Tara. And, anyhow, that last one,  the grey, is about equal to any two I ever saw; an immense whelp;  dog for sure, and a giant at that.\"    The Master lay down to sleep presently, on the couch with the  'possum-skin rug; and before many hours of the June daylight had  passed, he had verified his impressions of that last-born son of  Tara's as a grey-brindle, and the biggest whelp of its age that he  had ever seen. For purposes of registration in the books of the  Kennel Club--The Debrett of the dog world--the late-comer was  forthwith christened by the Mistress of the Kennels, under the name  of Finn, in honour of the memory of the fourth-century warrior  Finn, son of Cumall, lord of three hundred Irish Wolfhounds, whose  prowess in battle and in the chase were sung by Oisin in two  thousand, two hundred and seventy-two separate verses. Finn was  chief of King Cormac's household and master of his hounds; for the  most honoured counsellor that the ancient Kings of Ireland had were  masters of the hounds always.    And this was the way of the Irish Wolfhound Finn's entry into the  world, at the end of the first hour of a June day, in the Master's  den beside the Sussex Downs. You may see the embalmed body of his  great mother's sire, Champion O'Leary, if you care to look for it,  in the Natural History Museum at Kensington; woefully shorn of his  imposing beard and shaggy eyebrows, it is true, but yet only less  magnificent in death than he was always in life. Her mother was the  dam of the hound who marches to-day at the head of His Majesty's  Irish Guards. Between them, the sire and dam of Finn would have  scaled three hundred pounds, while either could easily have  stretched to a height above the shoulders of a six-foot man. Finn  rested easily in the palm of the Master's right hand when  christened by the Mistress of the Kennels, for he was little bigger  than a week-old kitten. But he was none the less Finn, the lineal  descendant of King Cormac's battle-hounds of fifteen hundred years  ago; and it was said he had the makings of the biggest Wolfhound  ever bred.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER III    THE FOSTER-MOTHER      Finn's first adventure came to him when he was no more than about  thirty-seven hours old, and, of course, still blind as any bat.  That being so, it may be taken that the grey whelp was not  particularly interested. Still, the event was important, and  probably affected the whole of Finn's after life. This was the way  of it:--    Early on the second morning of his life in this beautiful world,  Finn was lying snugly asleep between his mother's hind-legs on the  great bed at the stove-end of the outside den. When a litter of  puppies are lying with their mother there is always one place which  is snugger, and in various ways rather better than any other place.  You would have said that the little more or less shapeless, blind  lump of gristle and skin that was Finn, at this stage, had no more  intelligence or reasoning power than a potato; but it is to be  noted that, from the very beginning, this best place had been  exclusively occupied by him; and if while he slept one of his  wakeful brothers or sisters crawled over him and momentarily  usurped his proud position, then, in the very moment of his  awakening, that other puppy would be rolled backward, full of  gurgling and futile protestation, and Finn would resume the picked  place. Whatever was best in the way of warmth, and food, and  comfort, that Finn obtained, even at this absurdly rudimentary  stage, by token of superior weight, energy, and vitality. Also,  though the last to be born, Finn was the first to approach the  achievement of standing, for an instant, upon his own little pink-padded  feet, and the first, by days, to dream of the impertinence  of blindly pawing his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#5)"],[1,"a literal repetition in F minor  of what has been previously announced in D minor.    [Footnote 18: Another well-known example is the first theme of the  first movement of the _Sonata in F minor_ (_Appassionata_) op. 57.  This the student can look up for himself.]    Pieces of music which embody the principle of _Restatement after  Contrast_ are so numerous that the question is merely one of selecting  the clearest examples. In the Folk-Songs of every nation, as soon as  they had passed beyond the stage of a monotonous reiteration of some  phrase which pleased the fancy, _e.g._    [Music: _ad infinitum!_]    we find hardly one in which there is not a similarity between the  closing measures and something which had gone before. (See Supplement,  Example No. 5.) For the most elementary artistic experience would  establish the fact that the only way to avoid a monotonous repetition  of the same theme is to change to a different one. And the next step  is equally axiomatic--that, presupposing the first theme gives  pleasure on its initial appearance, it will be heard with heightened  pleasure at its reappearance after intervening contrast. A  psychological principle is herein involved which cannot be proved but  which is self-justified by its own reasonableness and is further  exemplified by many experiences in daily life. Sweet things taste the  sweeter after a contrast with something acid; we like to revisit old  scenes and to return home after a vacation. No delight is keener than  the _renewal_ of some aesthetic experience after its temporary  effacement through a change of appeal.[19] This practice is associated  with the inherent demand, spoken of above, for Variety in Unity. No  theme is of sufficient import to bear constant repetition; in fact,  the more eloquent it is, the more sated should we become if it were  continued overlong. Monotony, furthermore, is less tolerable in music  than in the other arts because music cuts deeper, because the ear is  so sensitive an organ and because we have no way of shutting off  sound. If a particular sight or scene displeases, we can close our  eyelids; but the ear is entirely unprotected and the only way to  escape annoying sounds is to take to flight.[20] We inevitably crave  contrast, change of sensation; and nothing gives more organic unity  than a return to whatever impressed us at the outset. This cyclic form  of musical expression, early discovered through free experimentation,  has remained the leading principle in all modern works, and--because  derived directly from life and nature--must be permanent. We return  whence we came; everything goes in circles. We can now understand  still more the need of a strong and accurate memory; for if we do not  know whether or not we have ever heard a theme, obviously the keen  pleasure of welcoming it anew is lost to us. Furthermore, this  principle of Restatement has in modern music some very subtle uses,  and presupposes the acquisition of a real power of reminiscence. For  example, Wagner's tone-drama of _Tristan and Isolde_ begins with this  haunting motive    [Music]    which, with its dual melodic lines, typifies the passionate love of  the two chief characters in the story. After three hours or more of  tragic action and musical development this motive is again introduced  in the very closing measures of the drama, to show that even in the  presence of transfiguring death this love is still their guiding  power.    [Music]    [Footnote 19: For some additional comments on this broad principle see  the first Chapter (passim) of Parry's _Evolution of the Art of  Music_.]    [Footnote 20: Everyone has experienced the agony of hearing the  beginner practice, in an adjoining room, the same piece for hours at a  time!]    For those who can appreciate the significance of such treatment, this  reminiscence is one of the most sublime touches in all musical drama.  The fascinating orchestral Scherzo of Richard Strauss's _Till  Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks_ likewise begins with a characteristic  motto,    [Music]    which says, in the language of music--I now have a story to tell you  of a certain freakish character; and then we are regaled with the  musical portrayal of a series of Till's pranks. As an Epilogue,  Strauss improvises on this opening theme as much as to say--you have  listened to my musical story, now let us indulge in some reflections  as to the fate of poor Till, for after all he was a good fellow. (See  Supplement, Example No. 6.)    It is evident, therefore, from the foregoing examples that the basic  principles of musical structure are coherence, refreshing variety and  such unity of general impression as may be gained chiefly by a  restatement, after contrast, of themes previously heard. Our  subsequent study will simply illustrate these natural laws of music in  their wider application.          CHAPTER II    THE FOLK-SONG      In the preceding chapter we made some general inquiries into the  nature of music and of those methods by which emotion and thought are  expressed. We shall assume therefore that the following facts are  established: that in music, by reason of the intangibility and  elusiveness of the material, sound and rhythm, the principle of Unity  in Variety is of paramount importance; and that the hearer, if he  would grasp the message expressed by these sounds and rhythms, must  make a _conscious_ effort of cooperation and not be content with mere  dreamy apathy. Furthermore, that Unity and Coherence are gained in  music by applying the principle of systematic Repetition or Imitation.  (We shall see, as we continue, how Variety has been secured by  contrasting themes, by episodical passages and by various devices of  rhythmic and harmonic development.)    We may now investigate the growth of musical structure and expression,  as manifested in the fields of the Folk-Song and of Polyphonic music,  beginning with the Folk-Song--historically the older and more  elemental in its appeal. We cannot imagine the time when human beings  did not use their voices in some form of emotional outpouring; and, as  far back as there are any historical records, we find traces of such  activity. For many centuries these rude cries of savage races were far  removed from anything like artistic design, but the advance towards  coherence and symmetry was always the result of free experimentation--hence  vitally connected with the emotions and mental processes of all human  effort. One of the most significant of the many sayings attributed to  Daniel Webster is that \"Sovereignty rests with the people\"; and it is  an interesting inquiry to see what wider application may be made of  this statement in the field of art. For it is a fact that there has  seldom been an important school of music, so-called--in any given  place and period--which was not founded on the emotional traits, the  aspirations and the ideals of the people. Surely one of the distinct  by-products of the Great War is to be the emancipation of the art of  music, along with that of all the other arts. Such a realization of  its nature and powers will result that it shall no longer be a mere  exotic amusement of the leisure and wealthy classes, but shall be  brought into direct touch with the rank and file of the people; even,  if you will, with the so-called \"lower classes\"--that part of humanity  from which, indeed, it sprung and with which it really belongs--just  human beings, just people. So in music also we may assert that  \"Sovereignty rests with the people.\" Although all art reflects popular  sentiment to a certain extent, in no one of the arts--as painting,  sculpture and architecture--is there such a vital record of the  emotions and artistic instincts of humanity as we find in the realm of  folk-song.[21] During the early period of Church music, while  theorists and scholars were struggling with the intricate problems of  polyphonic style, the people in their daily secular life were finding  an outlet for their emotions, for their joys and sorrows, in song and  in dance. This instinct for musical expression is universal, and just  because the products of such activity were unfettered by rules, they  exercised in process of time much influence upon the development of  modern style. Folk-songs are characterized by a freshness and  simplicity, a directness of utterance, which are seldom attained by  the conscious efforts of genius. \"Listen carefully to all folk-songs,\"  says Schumann. \"They are a storehouse of beautiful melody, and unfold  to the mind the innate character of the different peoples.\" They are  like wild flowers blooming unheeded by the wayside, the product of the  race rather than the individual, and for centuries were only slightly  known to cultivated musicians. It should be understood that words and  music were inextricably bound together and that, with both, dancing  was naturally associated; the very essence of a people's life being  expressed by this tripartite activity. Tonal variety is a marked  feature in folk-songs, many of them being in the old Gregorian modes,  while others show a decided inclination to our modern major and minor  scales. Great is the historical importance of Folk-music, because in  it we see a dawning recognition of the principles of instrumental  form, _i.e._, the need of balanced phrases, caused in the songs by the  metrical structure of the words, and in the dances by the symmetrical  movements of the body; a recognition above all, of the application of  a definite system of tonal-centres, and of repetition after contrast.  In fact, as we look back it is evident that the outlines of our most  important design, that known as the Sonata Form are--in a rudimentary  state--found in folk-music. Folk-melodies and rhythms play a large  part in the music of Haydn, Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Brahms, Grieg,  Tchaikowsky and Dvo[vr]ak. It seems as if modern composers were doing  for music what Luther"]]]
