That's why we slowed down after we were half-way  through. We were moving against gravity.\"    \"And what's up there, or down there, or whatever you call it?\" asked  Tommy, pointing to what ought to have been the sky.    \"Nothing. It's the center of the tennis ball, though I imagine it's  pretty near a vacuum when you get up a mile or so, owing to the speed of  the earth's rotation, which forces the heat into the shell.\"    \"You mean to say you actually believe that stuff you've been handing  me?\" asked Tommy, after a pause. \"Then how did human beings get here,  and those damn beetles? And why's the grass red?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"The grass is red because there's no sunlight to produce chlorophyll.  The inhabitants of the deep sea are red or black, almost invariably. In  the case of the humans, they've become bleached. My belief is that that  man and woman we saw, and those\"--he pointed to the vague forms of human  beings, who moved across the grass, gathering something--\"are survivors  of the primitive race that still exists as the Australians. Undoubtedly  one of the branches of the human stock originated in antarctica at a  time when it enjoyed a tropical temperature, and was the land bridge  between Australia and South America.\"    \"And the--beetles?\" asked Tommy.    \"Ah, they go back to the days when nature was in a more grandiose  mood!\" replied the archaeologist enthusiastically. \"That's the most  wonderful discovery of the ages. The world will go crazy over them when  we bring back the first living specimens to the zoological parks of the  great cities.    \"But,\" Dodd went on, speaking with still more enthusiasm, \"of course,  this is only the beginning, Tommy. There are ten million species of  insects, according to Riley, and it is inevitable that there must be  hundreds of thousands of other survivals from the age of the great  saurians, perhaps even some of the saurians themselves. Who knows but  that we may discover the ancestor of the extinct monotremes, the  rhynchocephalia, the pterodactyls, hatch a brood of aepyornis eggs--\"    \"And,\" said Tommy tartly, \"how are we going to get them back, apart from  the little problem of getting out of here ourselves?\"    \"Don't let's worry about that now,\" answered Dodd. \"It will take ten  years of the hardest kind of labor even to begin a classification of the  inhabitants of this inner world. I could sit down for ever, and--\"    But Jimmy Dodd rose to his feet as a pair of antenna whipped round his  neck and jerked him bodily upward.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the monster beetles was standing upright behind them, and by its  gestures it evidently meant that Dodd and Tommy were to join the crowd  of humans in the offing. As Dodd turned upon it with an indignant show  of fists, one of the antennae whipped off his fur coat and stung him  painfully with the bristle-like attachment at the end.    It was a painful moment when Dodd and Tommy realized that they were  powerless against the monstrous beetles. Tommy tried the uppercut with  which he had knocked out the deceased monster, but the quick jerks of  the present beetle's head were infinitely faster than the movements of  his fists, while the antenna had a whiplike quality about them that  speedily convinced him that discretion was the card to play.    Under the threat of the curling antenna, Tommy and Dodd moved in the  direction of the slowly circulating humans. Numerous tiny rodents, which  evidently kept the red grass short, scampered away under their feet. The  beetles made no further effort to force them on, but now they could see  that a number of the monsters were stationed at intervals around a wide  circle, keeping the humans in a single body.    \"Good Lord!\" ejaculated Tommy, stopping. \"See what they're doing, Dodd?  They're herding us, like cowboys herd steers. Look at that!\"           *       *       *       *       *    One of the herd, a male with a long beard, suddenly broke from the herd,  bawling, and flung himself upon a beetle guard. The antenna shot forth,  coiled around his neck, and hurled him a dozen feet to the ground, where  he lay stunned for a moment before arising and rejoining his companions.    \"But what are they looking for?\" demanded Dodd.    Tommy had not heard him. He had stopped in front of one of the luminous  trees and was plucking a fruit from it.    \"Jimmy, ever see an apple before?\" he asked. \"If this isn't an apple,  I'll eat my head.\"    It certainly was an apple, and one of the largest and juiciest that  Tommy had ever tasted. It was the reddest apple he had ever seen, and  would have won the first prize at any agricultural fair.    \"And look at this!\" shouted Tommy, plucking an enormous luminous peach  from another tree.    They began munching slowly, then, seeing one of the beetle guards  approaching them, they moved into the midst of the crowd.    \"Did you notice anything strange about those fruit trees?\" inquired  Dodd, as he munched. \"I'll swear they were monocotyledonous, which,  after all, is what one would expect. Still, to think that the  monocotyledons evolved the familiar drupes, or stone fruits, on a  parallel line to the dicotyledons is--amazing!\"    A box on the ear like the kick of a mule's hoof jerked the last word  from his lips as he went sprawling. He got up, to see the girl standing  before him, intense disgust and anger on her face.    She snatched the fruits from the hands of the two Americans and hurled  them away. It was evident from her manner that she considered such diet  in the highest degree unclean and disgusting; also that she considered  herself charged with the duty of superintending Tommy's and Dodd's  education, but especially Dodd's.           *       *       *       *       *    Taking him by the arm, she propelled him into the midst of the groping  humans. She released him, stooped, and suddenly stood up, a shrimp about  eighteen inches long in her hand.    Towering over Dodd by six inches, she took his face in her hands and  began caressing him; then, seizing his jaws in her strong fingers, she  pried them apart, and popped the tail end of the shrimp into his mouth.    Dodd let out a yelp, and spat out the love-gift, to be rewarded with  another box on the ear by the young Amazon, while Tommy stood by,  convulsed with laughter, and yet in considerable trepidation, for fear  of being forced to share Dodd's fate.    For the girl was again holding out the tail end of the crustacean, and  Jim Dodd's jaws were slowly and reluctantly approaching it.    But suddenly there came an intervention as the strident rasping of  beetle legs was heard in the distance. Panic seized the human herd,  grovelling for shrimps in the sandy soil with its tufts of red grasses.  Milling in an uneasy mob, they cowered under the lashes of the antenna  of the beetle guards, which sacrificed their backs through their hair  garments whenever any of them tried to bolt.    Nearer and nearer came the beetles, louder and more penetrating the  shriek of their rasping legs. Now the swarm came into sight, rank after  rank of the shell-clad monsters, leaping fifteen feet at a bound with  perfect precision, until they had formed a solid phalanx all around the  humans.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy heard sighs of despair, he heard muttering, and then he realized,  with deep thankfulness, that these human beings, degraded though they  were, had a speech of their own.    In the middle of the front line appeared a beetle a foot taller than the  rest. That it was either a king or queen was evident from the respect  paid it by the rest of the swarm. At its every movement a bodyguard of  beetles moved in unison, forming themselves in a group before it and on  either side.    There would have been something ludicrous about these movements, but for  the impression of horror that the swarm made upon Tommy and Jim Dodd.  Hitherto both had supposed that the hideous insects acted by blind  instinct, but now there could no longer be any doubt that they were  possessed of an organized intelligence.           *       *       *       *       *    The strident sounds grew louder. Already Tommy was beginning to discover  certain variations in them. It was dawning upon him that they formed a  language--and a perfectly intelligible one. For, as the note changed  about a half-semitone, two of the monsters left the side of their ruler  and reached the two men with three successive leaps.    Their movements left no doubt in either Tommy's or Dodd's mind what was  required. The two strode hastily toward the assemblage, and stopped as  the antenna of their guards came down in menacing fashion.    It was light enough for Tommy to see the face of the ruler of the  hellish swarm. And it required all his powers of will to keep from  collapsing from sheer horror at what he saw.    For, despite the close-fitting shell, the face of the beetle king was  the face of a man--a white man!    Jim Dodd's shriek rang out above the shrilling of the beetle-legs,  \"Bram! It's you, it's you! My God, it's you, Bram!\"          CHAPTER IV    _Bram's Story_      A sneering chuckle broke from Bram's lips. \"Yes, it's me, James Dodd,\"  he answered. \"I'm a little surprised to see you here, Dodd, but I'm  mighty glad. Still insane upon the subject of fossil monotremes, I  suppose?\"    The words came haltingly from Bram's lips, as from those of a man who  had lost the habit of easy speech. And Tommy, looking on, and trying to  keep in possession of his faculties, had already come to the conclusion  that the sounds were inaudible to the beetles. Probably their hearing  apparatus was not attuned to such slow vibrations of the human voice.
