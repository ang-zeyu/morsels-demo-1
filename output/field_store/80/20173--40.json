[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#5)"],[1,"I met Colonel Howard-Bury at lunch  with a Fellow of our Society, Mr. C. P. McCarthy. He was not a  mountaineer in the Alpine Club sense of the word, but he had spent much  of his time shooting in the Alps and in the Himalaya, and becoming  deeply interested in the Mount Everest project, had a talk with  Mr. Freshfield about it and made a formal application to the Society for  their support in undertaking an expedition. Things now began to move,  and the Society applied to the India Office for permission to send an  expedition into Tibet for the purpose of exploring Mount Everest. The  Government of India in reply said that they were not prepared at the  moment to approach the Tibetan Government; but they did not return any  absolute refusal.    During my Presidency the Society, in conjunction with the Alpine Club,  still further pressed the matter. We asked the Secretary of State for  India to receive a deputation from the two bodies, and the request being  granted and the deputation being assured of his sympathy we invited  Colonel Howard-Bury to proceed to India in June 1920 to explain our  wishes personally to the Government of India, and ask them to obtain for  us from the Dalai Lama the necessary permission to enter Tibet for the  purpose of exploring and climbing Mount Everest. Lord Chelmsford, the  Viceroy, received Colonel Howard-Bury most sympathetically and after  some preliminary difficulties had been overcome, Mr. Bell, the Political  Agent in Sikkim, who happened to be in Lhasa, was instructed to ask the  Dalai Lama for permission, and Mr. Bell being on most friendly terms  with His Holiness, permission was at once granted.    The one great obstacle in the way of approaching Mount Everest had now  at last been removed. What so many keen mountaineers had for years  dreamed of was within sight. And as soon as the welcome news  arrived--early in January 1921--preparations were commenced to organise  an expedition. A joint Committee of three representatives each from the  Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club was formed under the  Chairmanship of the President of the former Society and was named the  Mount Everest Committee. The three members of the Society were Sir  Francis Younghusband, Mr. E. L. Somers-Cocks (Honorary Treasurer) and  Colonel Jack. The three members of the Alpine Club were Professor Norman  Collie, Captain J. P. Farrar and Mr. C. F. Meade. Mr. Eaton and  Mr. Hinks were Honorary Secretaries.    Our first business was to select a leader for the Expedition. General  Bruce, who had had the idea in his mind for so many years, who knew the  Himalaya as no one else did, and who had a special aptitude for handling  Himalayan people, was now in England, and it was to him our thoughts  first turned. But he had just taken up an appointment with the  Glamorganshire Territorial Association and was not then available. In  these circumstances we were fortunate in having ready to hand a man with  such high qualifications as Colonel Howard-Bury. He had much to do on  his property in Ireland, but he willingly accepted our invitation to  lead the Expedition, and we could then proceed to the choice of the  mountaineers.    From the very first we decided that the main object of the Expedition  was to be the ascent of the mountain and that all other activities were  to be made subordinate to the supreme object of reaching the summit. It  was to be no mere surveying or geologising or botanising expedition  which would as a secondary object try to climb the mountain if it saw a  chance. To climb the mountain was to be the first object and the mapping  and everything else was to come afterwards. The reason for this is  obvious. What men really want to know is whether man can ascend the  highest mountain.    Knowledge of the topography, fauna and flora of that particular area is  of very small consequence in comparison with the knowledge of human  capacity to surmount the highest point in men's physical surroundings on  this earth. By some perversity of human nature there are men who shy at  putting the ascent of Mount Everest in the forefront, because it is  adventurous and must therefore, they seem to think, cease to be a  scientific object. They profess to be unconcerned with the climbing of  the mountain so long as a map is made or plants collected. But the  plain man instinctively sees the value of the adventure and knows that  the successful ascent of Mount Everest will show what man is capable of  and put new hope and heart into the human race.    But while it was decided to make the ascent of Mount Everest the main  object of the Expedition, Professor Norman Collie and Mr. Douglas  Freshfield from the first insisted that a whole season must be devoted  to a thorough reconnaissance of the mountain with a view to finding not  only a feasible route to the summit but what was without any doubt the  most feasible route. We knew nothing of the immediate approaches to the  mountain. But we knew that the only chance of reaching the summit was by  finding some way up which would entail little rock-climbing or ice  step-cutting. The mountain had therefore to be prospected from every  side to find a comparatively easy route and to make sure that no other  easier route than the one selected existed. This was considered ample  work for the Expedition for one season, while the following season would  be devoted to an all-out effort to reach the summit along the route  selected in the first year.    On this basis the first year's Expedition had accordingly to be  organised. The mountain party was to consist of four members, two of  whom were to be men of considerable experience and two younger men who  it was hoped would form the nucleus of the climbing party the next year.  Mr. Harold Raeburn, a member of the Alpine Club who had had great  experience of snow and rock work in the Alps, and who had in 1920 been  climbing on the spurs of Kanchenjunga, was invited to lead the mountain  party. Dr. Kellas, who had made several climbing expeditions in the  Himalaya and had in 1920 ascended to a height of 23,400 feet on Mount  Kamet, was also invited to join the climbing party. He had been making  experiments in the use of oxygen at high altitudes and was still out in  India preparing to continue these experiments on Mount Kamet in 1921.  It was suggested to him that he should make the experiments on Mount  Everest instead, and the party would thereby have the benefit of his  wide Himalayan experience. This invitation he accepted.    The two younger members selected for the climbing party were Mr. George  Leigh Mallory and Captain George Finch, both with a very high reputation  for climbing in the Alps. Unfortunately Captain Finch was for the time  indisposed and his place at the last moment had to be taken by  Mr. Bullock of the Consular Service, who had been at Winchester with  Mr. Mallory and who happened to be at home on leave. Through the  courtesy of Lord Curzon he was able to get special leave of absence from  the Foreign Office.    While we were finding the men we had also to be finding the money. As a  quite rough guess we estimated the Expedition for the two years would  cost about L10,000, and at least a substantial portion of this had to be  raised by private subscription. Appeals were made by their Presidents to  the Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society and to members of the  Alpine Club, and Captain Farrar was especially energetic in urging the  claims of the enterprise. As a result the members of the Alpine Club  subscribed over L3,000 and the Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society  nearly that amount. Later on with the advice and help of Mr. John Buchan  arrangements were made with _The Times_ and the _Philadelphia Ledger_  for the purchase of the rights of publication of telegrams from the  Expedition, and with the _Graphic_ for the purchase of photographs. So  eventually the financial position of the Expedition was assured.    The equipment and provisioning of the Expedition was undertaken by the  Equipment Committee--Captain Farrar and Mr. Meade--and the greatest  trouble was taken to ensure that the most suitable and best tents,  sleeping bags, clothing, boots, ice-axes, ropes, cooking apparatus,  provisions, etc., were purchased and that they were properly packed and  listed.    In the same way the scientific equipment was undertaken by Colonel Jack  and Mr. Hinks.    Finally the services of Mr. Wollaston, well known for his journeys in  New Guinea and East Africa, were secured as Medical Officer and  Naturalist to the Expedition.    Throughout these preparations the advice and help of the best men in  every line were freely and willingly forthcoming. For such an enterprise  all were ready to give a helping hand. Whether they were scientific men,  or business men or journalists, they were ready to throw aside their own  work and devote hours to ensuring that the Expedition should be a  success along the lines on which they severally had most experience.    And most valuable was the encouragement given to the Expedition by the  interest which His Majesty showed in conversation with the President,  and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in receiving Colonel  Howard-Bury--an interest which was shown in practical form by generous  subscriptions to the funds of the Expedition.    The Expedition was able, therefore, to set out from England under the  most favourable auspices, and it was to be joined in India by two  officers of the Indian Survey Department, Major Morshead and Major  Wheeler, and by an officer of the Indian Geological Survey, Dr. Heron.  It was thus admirably equipped for the acquirement of knowledge. But  acquirement of knowledge was not the only object which the Expedition  had in view. It could not be doubted that the region would possess  beauty of exceptional grandeur. So it was hoped that the Expedition  would discover, describe and reveal to us, by camera"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#5)"],[1," who, by the friendship of some under-clerk, was  enabled to smuggle off a bottle under his blanket. But the cunning clerk  had generally managed to get his \"good friend\" into a state so cleverly  between drunk and sober, before he entrusted him with the precious  bottle, that he was sure to betray himself. Leaving the shop with a mien  even more erect than usual, with a gait affected in its majesty, and his  blanket tightened around him to conceal his secret treasure, the  chuckling chief would start to cross the grounds within the fort. If he  was a new customer, he was once or twice permitted to play his little  game with the obliging clerk whose particular friend he was, and to  escape detection.    But by-and-by, when the officers had seen the offence repeated more than  once from their purposely contrived posts of observation, one of them  would skillfully chance to intercept the guilty chief at whose comical  endeavors to appear sober he was inwardly laughing, and charge him with  being intoxicated. Wresting away the tightened blanket, the bottle  appeared as evidence that could not be controverted, of the duplicity of  the Indian and the unfaithfulness of the clerk, whose name was instantly  demanded, that he might be properly punished. When the chief again  visited the fort, his particular friend met him with a sorrowful  countenance, reproaching him for having been the cause of his disgrace  and loss. This reproach was the surest means of preventing another  demand for rum, the Indian being too magnanimous, probably, to wish to  get his friend into trouble; while the clerk affected to fear the  consequences too much to be induced to take the risk another time. Thus  by kind and careful means the traffic in liquors was at length broken  up, which otherwise would have ruined both Indian and trader.    To the company's servants liquor was sold or allowed at certain times:  to those on the sea-board, one half-pint two or three times a year, to  be used as medicine,--not that it was always needed or used for this  purpose, but too strict inquiry into its use was wisely avoided,--and  for this the company demanded pay. To their servants in the interior no  liquor was sold, but they were furnished as a gratuity with one pint on  leaving rendezvous, and another on arriving at winter quarters. By this  management, it became impossible for them to dispose of drink to the  Indians; their small allowance being always immediately consumed in a  meeting or parting carouse.    The arrival of men from the interior at Fort Vancouver usually took  place in the month of June, when the Columbia was high, and a stirring  scene it was. The chief traders generally contrived their march through  the upper country, their camps, and their rendezvous, so as to meet the  Express which annually came to Vancouver from Canada and the Red River  settlements. They then descended the Columbia together, and arrived in  force at the Fort. This annual fleet went by the name of Brigade--a name  which suggested a military spirit in the crews that their appearance  failed to vindicate. Yet, though there was nothing warlike in the scene,  there was much that was exciting, picturesque, and even brilliant; for  these _couriers de bois_, or wood-rangers, and the _voyageurs_, or  boatmen, were the most foppish of mortals when they came to rendezvous.  Then, too, there was an exaltation of spirits on their safe arrival at  head-quarters, after their year's toil and danger in wildernesses, among  Indians and wild beasts, exposed to famine and accident, that almost  deprived them of what is called \"common sense,\" and compelled them to  the most fantastic excesses.    Their well-understood peculiarities did not make them the less welcome  at Vancouver. When the cry was given--\"the Brigade! the Brigade!\"--there  was a general rush to the river's bank to witness the spectacle. In  advance came the chief-trader's barge, with the company's flag at the  bow, and the cross of St. George at the stern: the fleet as many abreast  as the turnings of the river allowed. With strong and skillful strokes  the boatmen governed their richly laden boats, keeping them in line, and  at the same time singing in chorus a loud and not unmusical hunting or  boating song. The gay ribbons and feathers with which the singers were  bedecked took nothing from the picturesqueness of their appearance. The  broad, full river, sparkling in the sunlight, gemmed with emerald  islands, and bordered with a rich growth of flowering shrubbery; the  smiling plain surrounding the Fort; the distant mountains, where  glittered the sentinel Mt. Hood, all came gracefully into the picture,  and seemed to furnish a fitting back-ground and middle distance for the  bright bit of coloring given by the moving life in the scene. As with a  skillful sweep the brigade touched the bank, and the traders and men  sprang on shore, the first cheer which had welcomed their appearance was  heartily repeated, while a gay clamor of questions and answers followed.    After the business immediately incident to their arrival had been  dispatched, then took place the regale of pork, flour, and spirits,  which was sure to end in a carouse, during which blackened eyes and  broken noses were not at all uncommon; but though blood was made to  flow, life was never put seriously in peril, and the belligerent parties  were the best of friends when the fracas was ended.    The business of exchange being completed in three or four weeks--the  rich stores of peltries consigned to their places in the warehouse, and  the boats reladen with goods for the next year's trade with the Indians  in the upper country, a parting carouse took place, and with another  parade of feathers, ribbons, and other finery, the brigade departed  with songs and cheers as it had come, but with probably heavier hearts.    It would be a stern morality indeed which could look upon the excesses  of this peculiar class as it would upon the same excesses committed by  men in the enjoyment of all the comforts and pleasures of civilized  life. For them, during most of the year, was only an out-door life of  toil, watchfulness, peril, and isolation. When they arrived at the  rendezvous, for the brief period of their stay they were allowed perfect  license because nothing else would content them. Although at  head-quarters they were still in the wilderness, thousands of miles from  civilization, with no chance of such recreations as men in the continual  enjoyment of life's sweetest pleasures would naturally seek. For them  there was only one method of seeking and finding temporary oblivion of  the accustomed hardship; and whatever may be the strict rendering of  man's duty as an immortal being, we cannot help being somewhat lenient  at times to his errors as a mortal.    After the departure of the boats, there was another arrival at the Fort,  of trappers from the Snake River country. Previous to 1832, such were  the dangers of the fur trade in this region, that only the most  experienced traders were suffered to conduct a party through it; and  even they were frequently attacked, and sometimes sustained serious  losses of men and animals. Subsequently, however, the Hudson's Bay  Company obtained such an influence over even these hostile tribes as to  make it safe for a party of no more than two of their men to travel  through this much dreaded region.    There was another important arrival at Fort Vancouver, usually in  midsummer. This was the Company's supply ship from London. In the  possible event of a vessel being lost, one cargo was always kept on  store at Vancouver; but for which wise regulation much trouble and  disaster might have resulted, especially in the early days of the  establishment. Occasionally a vessel foundered at sea or was lost on the  bar of the Columbia; but these losses did not interrupt the regular  transaction of business. The arrival of a ship from London was the  occasion of great bustle and excitement also. She brought not only goods  for the posts throughout the district of the Columbia, but letters,  papers, private parcels, and all that seemed of so much value to the  little isolated world at the Fort.    A company conducting its business with such method and regularity as has  been described, was certain of success. Yet some credit also must attach  to certain individuals in its service, whose faithfulness, zeal, and  ability in carrying out its designs, contributed largely to its welfare.  Such a man was at the head of the Hudson's Bay Company's affairs in the  large and important district west of the Rocky Mountains. The Company  never had in its service a more efficient man than Gov. John McLaughlin,  more commonly called Dr. McLaughlin.    To the discipline, at once severe and just, which Dr. McLaughlin  maintained in his district, was due the safety and prosperity of the  company he served, and the servants of that company generally; as well  as, at a later period, of the emigration which followed the hunter and  trapper into the wilds of Oregon. Careful as were all the officers of  the Hudson's Bay Company, they could not always avoid conflicts with the  Indians; nor was their kindness and justice always sufficiently  appreciated to prevent the outbreak of savage instincts. Fort Vancouver  had been threatened in an early day; a vessel or two had been lost in  which the Indians were suspected to have been implicated; at long  intervals a trader was murdered in the interior; or more frequently,  Indian insolence put to the test both the wisdom and courage of the  officers to prevent an outbreak.    When murders and robberies were committed, it was the custom at Fort  Vancouver to send a strong party to demand the offenders from their  tribe; Such was the well known power and influence of the Company, and  such the wholesome fear of the \"King George men,\" that this demand was  never resisted, and if the murderer"]]]
