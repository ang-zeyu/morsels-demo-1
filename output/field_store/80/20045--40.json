Clarendon gives the number as 5,000, two parts of whom  were Parliamentarian, and one part the King's, but the probability is  that it was nearer, a half of that number. Fiennes[PB] puts down the  losses acknowledged by the Royalists themselves as 2,000. Certainly the  records show that they were exceptionally heavy in officers, one writer  adducing as a reason that \"the rebel officers had fleeter horses, so not  so many of them were slain.\" During the cold frosty night after the battle  the wounded must of necessity have been left exposed, inasmuch as the  fight stretched over many miles of country, and was continued until night;  nor do the Royalists appear to have been debarred from searching for their  wounded, as we learn by the succour of old Sir Gervase Scroop by his son.  The King's troops says Clarenden \"had not the shelter of tree or hedge,  and after a very cold night spent on the field, without any refreshment of  victual or provision for the soldiers (for the country was so disaffected  that it not only sent no provisions, but many soldiers who straggled into  the villages for relief were knocked on the head by the common people),  the King found his troops very thin.\" The Parliamentarians, whose baggage  had been cut up by Rupert, could not have been in much better plight; some  of them, however, fired the Dassett Beacon, and the news of the conflict  was thus flashed across country to London. Though so much is recorded of  Mr. Wilmot's (afterwards Lord Rochester, of Adderbury,) position and work  during the day, nothing other than the mere statement is made of a far  greater leader, Spencer Compton, Earl of Northampton, than that he was at  Edge Hill, with some of the best disciplined men.[MW] It would seem that  the extended movement of the Royalist forces along the hill ridge in the  early part of the day was to give support to Compton Wynyate, or get aid  therefrom. It was but three miles distant. Whether any deflection of  Hampden's force moving from Stratford-on-Avon was made to mask or retard  Compton's men is mere surmise: the main part of Hampden's rear did not  reach the field until the Sunday midnight, when Essex got reinforced by a  regiment of horse and two of foot.    The story of successive campaigns, as in this the first fight, resolves  itself into the superiority of the heavy armament of the Parliamentarian  horse. The improved status of the men added greater force at a later date.  With all the dash, and all the value of the light horse of the King for  foray, when in the field the cavalier went down before the iron armed  horse of the Parliament's army.    On the following day, the two armies again drew up, the Parliamentarians  having in the early morning retired from the hill side towards  Kineton,[PB] but neither showed any disposition to renew the fight. Essex  was pressed to do so by some of his more impetuous officers, but wanted  the daring necessary for so bold a movement. Charles sent a messenger into  the rebel lines with a pardon for Earl Essex, which \"messenger returned  with so great a sense of danger as not to have observed the number and  disposition of the Parliamentary forces.\" Later on, Essex retired to  Warwick with his troops, and Prince Rupert is reported to have followed,  but failed to overtake them, though it is stated that he destroyed many  wagons and carriages with munitions, &c. The reconnaissance appears to  have been otherwise fruitless, for the King at once marched southward, and  received the surrender of Banbury Castle, and also subsequently of  Broughton Castle. Lord Saye, Sir Wm. Cobb, of Adderbury, and John Doyley,  Esq., were not only proclaimed traitors, but were specially exempted from  the King's pardon.[y430]    The position of the graves in which the slain were buried is about 200  yards south of Thistle Farm, the ground bearing still the name of the  Grave Field, and a wych elm marks the site of one of the graves.    The part that Oliver Cromwell played in the struggle has not unnaturally  been the cause of much comment. Carlyle[q101] characteristically cuts the  Gordian knot with the statement, \"Captain Cromwell _was_ present, and did  his duty, let angry Denzil say what he will.\"[6] Denzil Hollis's[o226]  charge that Cromwell purposely absented himself from the field may be  fairly set aside on the ground of malice, his enmity being openly shown,  and moreover it meets contradiction in Cromwell's own statement:[Q249] \"At  my first going out into this engagement, I saw our men were beaten at  every hand. I did indeed.\" Neither can Dugdale's[C] account of Cromwell's  hurried descent from a church steeple by means of the bell rope, when he  saw the Parliamentarian disaster, be received in the face of the letter  written by Captain Nathaniel Fiennes,[PB] which ends thus: \"These persons  underwritten were all of the Right wing and never stirred from their  Troops, but they and their Troops fought till the last minute. The Lord  Generall's Regiment--Sir Philip Stapleton, Captain Draper, Serjeant Major  Gunter, Lord Brookes, Captain Sheffield, Captain Temple, Captain Cromwell;  Sir William Belfore's Regiment--Sir William Belfore, Serjeant Major  Hurrey, Lord Grey, Captain Nathaniell Fiennes, Sir Arthur Hasilrigge,  Captain Longe.\" It is equally curious that Captain Oliver Cromwell, of  Troop Sixty-Seven,[q100] was at Edge Hill in the place he invariably  occupied during the civil war, viz., with the victorious wing, and that  the history of the fluctuations of the fight should be repeated in so many  of the great battles, Naseby and Marston Moor to wit.

Mr. _Nathaniel Fiennes_ his Letter to his Father.    MY LORD,    I have sent to your Lordship a Relation of the last Battell fought in  _Keynton_ Field, which I shewed to the Generall and Lievtenant Generall of  the Horse, and divers Colonels and Officers, and they conceive it to be  right and according to the truth: For the ill writing of it, I desire that  your Lordship would excuse me, for I had not time to write it over again;  yet I suppose it may be read, and your Lordship may cause it to be written  faire, if your Lordship thinke it worth so much. For that which your  Lordship writeth concerning my brother _John_, is a most false and  malicious slander which that fellow hath raised upon him, that he should  be the first man that fled on the left wing, when as none of your  Lordship's sonnes were in the left wing, and my brother _John_ was not at  all in the field while the fight was; for by occasion that I intreated him  on Saturday morning, when we marched towards _Keynton_ (little dreaming of  a Battell the next day) to go to _Evesham_ (which was but three miles from  the quarter where our Troops lay, before they marched with the Army to  _Keynton_) for to take some Arms that were come thither the night before,  for such of our men as wanted Arms, and so to come after to the Rendevous  at _Keynton_. He could not come thither on Saturday with those men of both  Troops which went backe with him to _Evesham_ for their Arms, but the next  day he came thither between three or foure of the clock; at which time our  left wing being defeated, many of the Runaways met with him as he was  coming to the Army; and happily among the rest, this fellow that raised  this report; for that _Vivers_ which your Lordship mentioneth, was not  Captain _Vivers_ (for he was in _Banbury_) but a brother of his that was  in one of Colonell _Goodwin's_ Troops, and as I heard my brother say, he  saw him there; and I heard my Lord Generall say, that _Vivers_ was one of  the first that ran away: Now it seemes that those men that ran away so  timely, seeing my brother before them, reported as if he had fled from the  Army, which is so contrary to the truth, that he tooke a great deale of  pains to make his own men and Captain Vivers' men which were with him to  stand, and to stop the Runaways that came from the Army, and this he did,  and made two or three stands, and at length gathered a pretty body upon a  hill together, and with them (there being Captain Keightlye's, and Captain  Cromwell's Troope, at length came to them also) he marched towards the  Town; and hearing the enemy was there (as indeed they were with the  greatest part of their horse they made a stand, and sending forth their  Scouts to give them intelligence where the enemy and where our Forces  were, at length they came to knowledge of Colonell _Hampden's_ Brigado  that was coming another way to the Town, and so joyning themselves unto  them, they came to the Army together. My Lord Generall is very sensible of  the wrong that this fellow hath done my brother, and will inquire after  him to have him punished, as he hath written to my Lord _Wharton_  concerning him, to let you know so much. Master _Bond_ whom he citeth for  one of his authors, denies that ere he spake to my brother at all, or that  he saw any such thing of flying, as that base fellow reporteth, and this  your Lordship"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296"],[0,"The Confessions of St. Augustine (#5)"],[1,",  and Thou lettest me alone, and I was tossed about, and wasted, and  dissipated, and I boiled over in my fornications, and Thou heldest Thy  peace, O Thou my tardy joy! Thou then heldest Thy peace, and I wandered  further and further from Thee, into more and more fruitless seed-plots  of sorrows, with a proud dejectedness, and a restless weariness.    Oh! that some one had then attempered my disorder, and turned to account  the fleeting beauties of these, the extreme points of Thy creation! had  put a bound to their pleasureableness, that so the tides of my youth  might have cast themselves upon the marriage shore, if they could not be  calmed, and kept within the object of a family, as Thy law prescribes,  O Lord: who this way formest the offspring of this our death, being  able with a gentle hand to blunt the thorns which were excluded from Thy  paradise? For Thy omnipotency is not far from us, even when we be far  from Thee. Else ought I more watchfully to have heeded the voice from  the clouds: Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh, but I  spare you. And it is good for a man not to touch a woman. And, he that  is unmarried thinketh of the things of the Lord, how he may please the  Lord; but he that is married careth for the things of this world, how he  may please his wife.    To these words I should have listened more attentively, and being  severed for the kingdom of heaven's sake, had more happily awaited Thy  embraces; but I, poor wretch, foamed like a troubled sea, following the  rushing of my own tide, forsaking Thee, and exceeded all Thy limits; yet  I escaped not Thy scourges. For what mortal can? For Thou wert ever with  me mercifully rigorous, and besprinkling with most bitter alloy all my  unlawful pleasures: that I might seek pleasures without alloy. But where  to find such, I could not discover, save in Thee, O Lord, who teachest  by sorrow, and woundest us, to heal; and killest us, lest we die from  Thee. Where was I, and how far was I exiled from the delights of Thy  house, in that sixteenth year of the age of my flesh, when the madness  of lust (to which human shamelessness giveth free licence, though  unlicensed by Thy laws) took the rule over me, and I resigned myself  wholly to it? My friends meanwhile took no care by marriage to save my  fall; their only care was that I should learn to speak excellently, and  be a persuasive orator.    For that year were my studies intermitted: whilst after my return from  Madaura (a neighbour city, whither I had journeyed to learn grammar and  rhetoric), the expenses for a further journey to Carthage were being  provided for me; and that rather by the resolution than the means of my  father, who was but a poor freeman of Thagaste. To whom tell I this? not  to Thee, my God; but before Thee to mine own kind, even to that small  portion of mankind as may light upon these writings of mine. And to what  purpose? that whosoever reads this, may think out of what depths we are  to cry unto Thee. For what is nearer to Thine ears than a confessing  heart, and a life of faith? Who did not extol my father, for that beyond  the ability of his means, he would furnish his son with all necessaries  for a far journey for his studies' sake? For many far abler citizens  did no such thing for their children. But yet this same father had no  concern how I grew towards Thee, or how chaste I were; so that I were  but copious in speech, however barren I were to Thy culture, O God, who  art the only true and good Lord of Thy field, my heart.    But while in that my sixteenth year I lived with my parents, leaving all  school for a while (a season of idleness being interposed through the  narrowness of my parents' fortunes), the briers of unclean desires grew  rank over my head, and there was no hand to root them out. When that my  father saw me at the baths, now growing towards manhood, and endued  with a restless youthfulness, he, as already hence anticipating his  descendants, gladly told it to my mother; rejoicing in that tumult of  the senses wherein the world forgetteth Thee its Creator, and becometh  enamoured of Thy creature, instead of Thyself, through the fumes of that  invisible wine of its self-will, turning aside and bowing down to the  very basest things. But in my mother's breast Thou hadst already begun  Thy temple, and the foundation of Thy holy habitation, whereas my  father was as yet but a Catechumen, and that but recently. She then was  startled with a holy fear and trembling; and though I was not as yet  baptised, feared for me those crooked ways in which they walk who turn  their back to Thee, and not their face.    Woe is me! and dare I say that Thou heldest Thy peace, O my God, while I  wandered further from Thee? Didst Thou then indeed hold Thy peace to me?  And whose but Thine were these words which by my mother, Thy faithful  one, Thou sangest in my ears? Nothing whereof sunk into my heart, so as  to do it. For she wished, and I remember in private with great anxiety  warned me, \"not to commit fornication; but especially never to defile  another man's wife.\" These seemed to me womanish advices, which I should  blush to obey. But they were Thine, and I knew it not: and I thought  Thou wert silent and that it was she who spake; by whom Thou wert not  silent unto me; and in her wast despised by me, her son, the son of Thy  handmaid, Thy servant. But I knew it not; and ran headlong with such  blindness, that amongst my equals I was ashamed of a less shamelessness,  when I heard them boast of their flagitiousness, yea, and the more  boasting, the more they were degraded: and I took pleasure, not only in  the pleasure of the deed, but in the praise. What is worthy of dispraise  but vice? But I made myself worse than I was, that I might not be  dispraised; and when in any thing I had not sinned as the abandoned  ones, I would say that I had done what I had not done, that I might not  seem contemptible in proportion as I was innocent; or of less account,  the more chaste.    Behold with what companions I walked the streets of Babylon, and  wallowed in the mire thereof, as if in a bed of spices and precious  ointments. And that I might cleave the faster to its very centre, the  invisible enemy trod me down, and seduced me, for that I was easy to be  seduced. Neither did the mother of my flesh (who had now fled out of  the centre of Babylon, yet went more slowly in the skirts thereof as  she advised me to chastity, so heed what she had heard of me from her  husband, as to restrain within the bounds of conjugal affection, if it  could not be pared away to the quick) what she felt to be pestilent  at present and for the future dangerous. She heeded not this, for she  feared lest a wife should prove a clog and hindrance to my hopes. Not  those hopes of the world to come, which my mother reposed in Thee; but  the hope of learning, which both my parents were too desirous I should  attain; my father, because he had next to no thought of Thee, and of  me but vain conceits; my mother, because she accounted that those  usual courses of learning would not only be no hindrance, but even some  furtherance towards attaining Thee. For thus I conjecture, recalling, as  well as I may, the disposition of my parents. The reins, meantime, were  slackened to me, beyond all temper of due severity, to spend my time in  sport, yea, even unto dissoluteness in whatsoever I affected. And in all  was a mist, intercepting from me, O my God, the brightness of Thy truth;  and mine iniquity burst out as from very fatness.    Theft is punished by Thy law, O Lord, and the law written in the hearts  of men, which iniquity itself effaces not. For what thief will abide a  thief? not even a rich thief, one stealing through want. Yet I lusted to  thieve, and did it, compelled by no hunger, nor poverty, but through a  cloyedness of well-doing, and a pamperedness of iniquity. For I stole  that, of which I had enough, and much better. Nor cared I to enjoy what  I stole, but joyed in the theft and sin itself. A pear tree there was  near our vineyard, laden with fruit, tempting neither for colour nor  taste. To shake and rob this, some lewd young fellows of us went, late  one night (having according to our pestilent custom prolonged our sports  in the streets till then), and took huge loads, not for our eating, but  to fling to the very hogs, having only tasted them. And this, but to  do what we liked only, because it was misliked. Behold my heart, O  God, behold my heart, which Thou hadst pity upon in the bottom of the  bottomless pit. Now, behold, let my heart tell Thee what it sought  there, that I should be gratuitously evil, having no temptation to ill,  but the ill itself. It was foul, and I loved it; I loved to perish,  I loved mine own fault, not that for which I was faulty, but my fault  itself. Foul soul, falling from Thy firmament to utter destruction; not  seeking aught through the shame, but the shame itself!    For there is an attractiveness in beautiful bodies, in gold and silver,  and all things; and in bodily touch, sympathy hath much influence, and  each other sense hath his proper object answerably tempered. Worldy  honour hath also its grace, and the power of overcoming, and of mastery;  whence springs also the thirst of revenge. But yet, to obtain all these,  we may not depart from Thee, O Lord, nor decline from Thy law. The life  also which here we live hath its own enchantment, through a certain  proportion of its own, and a correspondence with all things beautiful  here below. Human friendship also is endeared with a sweet tie, by  reason of the unity formed of many souls. Upon occasion of all these,  and the like, is sin committed, while through an immoderate inclination  towards these goods of the lowest order, the better and higher are  forsaken,--Thou, our Lord God, Thy truth, and Thy law. For these lower  things have their delights, but not like my God, who"]]]
