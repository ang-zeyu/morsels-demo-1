The language  runs thus--\"_There is one only living and true God, without body,  parts, or passions; consisting of three persons--the Father, Son, and  Holy Ghost_.\"    It is painful to the human mind to be compelled to admit, that such  wonderful inconsistencies of language or ideas, have ever found place  in any human creed. Yet, so it is.    It is but another way of saying, that there is a God who does not  exist, a God who is composed of nonentity, who is the negative of all  existence, who occupies no space, who exists in no time, who is  composed of no substance, known or unknown, and who has no powers or  properties in common with any thing or being known to exist, or which  can possibly be conceived of, as existing either in the heavens or on  the earth.    Such a God could never be seen, heard, or felt, by any being in the  universe.    There never has been a visible idol worshipped among men, which was so  powerless as this \"_God without body, parts, or passions_.\"    The god of Egypt, the crocodile, could destroy.    The images of different nations could be felt and seen.    The Peruvian god, the Sun, could diffuse its genial warmth, light, and  influence.    But not so with the God without \"_body, parts, or passions_.\"    That which has no parts, has no whole.    Beings which have no passions, have no soul.    Before we can introduce the keys and powers of practical Theology to  the understanding of men in this age, we must, of necessity, place  within their comprehension some correct ideas of the true God.    It is written that, \"_without faith it is impossible to please Him_.\"  Those who do not please Him, can never partake of the powers and gifts  of the science of Theology, because the keys and powers of this  science emanate from Him as a free gift, but they are never given to  those with whom He is not well pleased. The individual who would  partake of this power, must therefore have faith in Him. But how can  he believe in a being of whom he has no correct idea?    So vague, so foreign from the simple, plain truth, are the ideas of  the present age, so beclouded is the modern mind with mysticism,  spiritual nonentity, or immateriality in nearly all of its ideas of  the person or persons of the Deity, that we are constrained to use the  language of an ancient Apostle, as addressed to the learned of  Athens--\"_Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship. Him declare I unto  you_.\"    Although there are facts in our own existence, which are beyond our  present comprehension or capacity, which is true, in a higher sense,  in relation to the Godhead, still the limited knowledge we are able to  comprehend in relation to ourselves, may at least be rational, and be  as clearly conveyed and understood as any other subject. So with our  knowledge of Deity. Although there are facts beyond our reach in  relation to His existence, attributes, and power, yet that which we  may know and comprehend or express of Him, should be divested of all  mystery, and should be as clearly conceived, expressed, and conveyed  as any other item of truth or of science.    Jesus Christ, a little babe like all the rest of us have been, grew to  be a man, was filled with a divine substance or fluid, called the Holy  Spirit, by which he comprehended and spake the truth in power and  authority; and by which he controlled the elements, and imparted  health and life to those who were prepared to partake of the same.    This man died, being put to death by wicked men.    He arose from the dead the third day, and appeared to his disciples.  These disciples, on seeing him, supposed him to be a spirit only.    They may have possessed some of the vague ideas of men in more modern  times, in regard to an immaterial existence beyond the grave: an  existence unconnected with any real or tangible matter, or substance.    But their risen Lord adopted the most simple means of dispersing their  _mysticism_, their _spiritual vagaries_ or _immateriality_. He called  upon them to handle him and see, \"_For_\" said he, \"_a spirit hath not  flesh and bones, as ye see me have_.\"    They accordingly handled him, examined the prints of the nails in his  hands and feet, and the mark of the spear in his side. But, as if this  was not enough in order to familiarize them still more with the facts  of a material or tangible immortality, he ate and drank with  them--partaking of a broiled fish and an honey-comb.    In short, he was with them for forty days, in which he walked, talked,  ate, drank, taught, prophesied, commanded, commissioned, reasoned with  and blessed them, thus familiarizing to them that immortality and  eternal life which he wished them to teach in all the world.    He then ascended up in their presence, toward that planet where dwelt  his Father and their Father, his God and their God.    While he was yet in sight in the open firmament, and they stood gazing  upward, behold! two men stood by them in white raiment, and said--    \"_Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same  Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like  manner as ye have seen him go into heaven_.\"    Here, then, we have a sample of an immortal God--a God who is often  declared in the Scriptures to be like his father, \"_being the  brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person_,\" and  possessing the same attributes as his Father, in all their fulness; a  God not only possessing body and parts, but flesh and bones, and  sinews, and all the attributes, organs, senses, and affections of a  perfect man.    He differs in nothing from his Father, except in age and authority,  the Father having the seniority, and, consequently, the right,  according to the Patriarchal laws of eternal Priesthood, to preside  over him, and over all his dominions, for ever and ever.    While on the one hand, this God claims affinity and equality, as it  were, with his Father, he claims, on the other hand, affinity and  equality with his brethren, on the earth, with this difference,  however, that his person is a specimen of Divine, eternal Humanity,  immortalized, and with attributes perfected; while his brethren who  dwell in mortal flesh, although children of the same royal Parent in  the heavens, are not yet immortalized, as it regards their fleshly  tabernacles, and are not perfected in their attributes; and although  joint heirs, are younger, he being the first born among many brethren  in the spiritual world. They are therefore subject to him.    But every man who is eventually made perfect--raised from the dead,  and filled, or quickened, with a fulness of celestial glory, will  become like them in every respect, physically, and in intellect,  attributes or powers.    The very germs of these Godlike attributes, being engendered in man,  the offspring of Deity, only need cultivating, improving, developing,  and advancing by means of a series of progressive changes, in order to  arrive at the fountain \"_Head_,\" the standard, the climax of Divine  Humanity.    The difference between Jesus Christ and his Father is this--one is  subordinate to the other, does nothing of himself, independently of  the Father, but does all things in the name and by the authority of  the Father, being of the same mind in all things. The difference  between Jesus Christ and another immortal and celestial man is  this--the man is subordinate to Jesus Christ, does nothing in and of  himself, but does all things in the name of Christ, and by his  authority, being of the same mind, and ascribing all the glory to him  and his Father.    On account of the double relationship of Jesus Christ--with God the  Father on one hand, and with man on the other, many have adopted the  creed, that \"_Two whole and perfect natures_\" were blended in the  person of Jesus Christ; that he was every way a God, and every way a  man; as if God and man were two distinct species. This error came by  reason of not knowing ourselves. For just in proportion as we  comprehend ourselves in our true light, and our relationships and  affinities with the past, present and future, with time and eternity,  with Gods, angels, spirits and men, who have gone before us, and who  will come after us, so, in proportion, we may be able to benefit by  the keys of the mysteries of the Godhead, or, in other words, to know  and comprehend Jesus Christ and his Father.    Gods, angels and men, are all of one species, one race, one great  family widely diffused among the planetary systems, as colonies,  kingdoms, nations, &c.    The great distinguishing difference between one portion of this race  and another, consists in the varied grades of intelligence and purity,  and also in the variety of spheres occupied by each, in the series of  progressive being.    An immortal man, possessing a perfect organization of spirit, flesh,  and bones, and perfected in his attributes, in all the fulness of  celestial glory, is called _a God_.    An immortal man, in progress of perfection, or quickened with a lesser  degree of glory, is called _an angel_.    An immortal spirit of man, not united with a fleshly tabernacle, is  called a spirit.    An immortal man, clothed with a mortal tabernacle, is called a man.    It may then consistently enough be said, that there are, in a  subordinate sense, a plurality of Gods, or rather of the sons of God;  although there is one Supreme Head, who is over all, and through all,  and in all His sons, by the power of His Spirit.    Jesus Christ and his Father are two persons, in the same sense as John  and Peter are two persons. Each of them has an organized, individual  tabernacle, embodied in material form, and composed of material  substance, in the likeness of man, and possessing every organ, limb,  and physical part that man possesses.

Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay. (#5)"],[1,"animal. We have seen how the main cavity becomes divided by radiating  partitions into numerous chambers; but while these internal changes  are going on, corresponding external appendages are forming in the  shape of the tentacles, which add so much to the beauty of the animal,  and play so important a part in its history. The tentacles, at first  only few in number, are in fact so many extensions of the inner  chambers, gradually narrowing upward till they form these delicate  hollow feelers which make a soft downy fringe all around the mouth.  (Fig. 7.) They do not start abruptly from the summit, but the upper  margin of the body itself thins out to form more or less extensive  lobes, through which the partitions and chambers continue their  course, and along the edge of which the tentacles arise.        [Illustration: Fig. 7. View from above of an Actinia with all its      tentacles expanded; _o_ mouth, _b_ crescent-shaped folds at      extremity of mouth, _a a_ folds round mouth, _t t t_ tentacles.]        [Illustration: Figs. 8, 9. Young Actiniae in different stages of      growth.]    The eggs are not always laid in the condition of the simple planula  described above. They may, on the contrary, be dropped from the parent  in different stages of development, sometimes even after the tentacles  have begun to form, as in Figs. 8, 9. Neither is it by means of eggs  alone that these animals reproduce themselves; they may also multiply  by a process of self-division. The disk of an Actinia may contract  along its centre till the circular outline is changed to that of a  figure 8, this constriction deepening gradually till the two halves of  the 8 separate, and we have an Actinia with two mouths, each  surrounded by an independent set of tentacles. Presently this  separation descends vertically till the body is finally divided from  summit to base, and we have two Actiniae where there was originally but  one. Another and a far more common mode of reproduction among these  animals is that of budding like corals. A slight swelling arises on  the side of the body or at its base; it enlarges gradually, a  digestive cavity is formed within it, tentacles arise around its  summit, and it finally drops off from the parent and leads an  independent existence. As a number of these buds are frequently formed  at once, such an Actinia, surrounded by its little family, still  attached to the parent, may appear for a time like a compound stock,  though their normal mode of existence is individual and distinct.    The Actinia is exceedingly sensitive, contracting the body and drawing  in the tentacles almost instantaneously at the slightest touch. These  sudden movements are produced by two powerful sets of muscles, running  at right angles with each other through the thickness of the body  wall; the one straight and vertical, extending from the base of the  wall to its summit; the other circular and horizontal, stretching  concentrically around it. By the contraction of the former, the body  is of course shortened; by the contraction of the latter, the body is,  on the contrary, lengthened in proportion to the compression of its  circumference. Both sets can easily be traced by the vertical and  horizontal lines crossing each other on the external wall of the body,  as in Fig. 5. Each tentacle is in like manner furnished with a double  set of muscles, having an action similar to that described above. In  consequence of these violent muscular contractions, the water imbibed  by the animal, and by which all its parts are distended to the utmost,  is forced, not only out of the mouth, but also through small openings  in the body wall scarcely perceptible under ordinary circumstances,  but at such times emitting little fountains in every direction.    Notwithstanding its extraordinary sensitiveness, the organs of the  senses in the Actinia are very inferior, consisting only of a few  pigment cells accumulated at the base of the tentacles. The two sets  of muscles meet at the base of the body, forming a disk, or kind of  foot, by which the animal can fix itself so firmly to the ground, that  it is very difficult to remove it without injury. It is nevertheless  capable of a very limited degree of motion, by means of the expansion  and contraction of this foot-like disk.    The Actiniae are extremely voracious; they feed on mussels and cockles,  sucking the animals out of their shells. When in confinement they may  be fed on raw meat, and seem to relish it; but if compelled to do so,  they will live on more meagre fare, and will even thrive for a long  time on such food as they may pick up in the water where they are  kept.      _Rhodactinia_ (_Rhodactinia Davisii_ AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 10. Rhodactinia Davisii Ag.; natural size.]    Very different from this is the bright red Rhodactinia (Fig. 10),  quite common in the deeper waters of our bay, while farther north, in  Maine, it occurs at low-water mark. Occasionally it may be found  thrown up on our sandy beaches after a storm, and then, if it has not  been too long out of its native element, or too severely buffeted by  the waves, it will revive on being thrown into a bucket of fresh  sea-water, expand to its full size, and show all the beauty of its  natural coloring. It is crowned with a wreath of thick, short  tentacles (Fig. 10), and though so vivid and bright in color, it is  not so pretty as the more common Actinia marginata, with its soft  waving wreath of plume-like feelers, in comparison to which the  tentacles of the Rhodactinia are clumsy and slow in their movements.    All Actiniae are not attached to the soil like those described above,  nor do they all terminate in a muscular foot, some being pointed or  rounded at their extremity. Many are nomadic, wandering about at will  during their whole lifetime, others live buried in the sand or mud,  only extending their tentacles beyond the limits of the hole where  they make their home; while others again lead a parasitic life,  fastening themselves upon our larger jelly-fish, the Cyaneae, though  one is at a loss to imagine what sustenance they can derive from  animals having so little solidity, and consisting so largely of water.      _Arachnactis_. (_Arachnactis brachiolata_ A. AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 11. Arachnactis brachiolata A. Ag., greatly      magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 12. Young Arachnactis.]        [Illustration: Fig. 13. Young Arachnactis seen so as to show the      mouth.]    Among the nomadic Polyps is a small floating Actinia, called  Arachnactis, (Fig. 11,) from its resemblance to a spider. They are  found in great plenty floating about during the night, feeling their  way in every direction by means of their tentacles, which are large in  proportion to the size of the animal, few in number, and turned  downward when in their natural attitude. The partitions and the  digestive cavity enclosed between them are short, as will be seen in  Fig. 11, when compared to the general cavity of the body floating  balloon-like above them. Around the mouth is a second row of shorter  tentacles, better seen in a younger specimen (Fig. 12). This Actinia  differs from those described above, in having two of the sides  flattened, instead of being perfectly circular. Looked at from above  (as in Fig. 13) this difference in the diameters is very perceptible;  there is an evident tendency towards establishing a longitudinal axis.  In the sea-anemone, this disposition is only hinted at in the slightly  pointed folds or projections on opposite sides of the circle formed by  the mouth, which in the Arachnactis are so elongated as to produce a  somewhat narrow slit (see Fig. 13), instead of a circular opening. The  mouth is also a little out of centre, rather nearer one end of the  disk than the other. These facts are interesting, as showing that the  tendency towards establishing a balance of parts, as between an  anterior and posterior extremity, a right and left side, is not  forgotten in these lower animals, though their organization as a whole  is based upon an equality of parts, admitting neither of posterior and  anterior extremities, nor of right and left, nor of above and below,  in a structural sense. This animal also presents a seeming anomaly in  the mode of formation of the young tentacles, which always make their  appearance at the posterior extremity of the longitudinal axis, the  new ones being placed behind the older ones, instead of alternating  with them as in other Actiniae.      _Bicidium_. (_Bicidium parasiticum_ AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 14. Bicidium parasiticum; natural size.]    The Bicidium (Fig. 14), our parasitic Actinia, is to be sought for in  the mouth-folds of the Cyanea, our common large red Jelly-fish. In any  moderate-sized specimen of the latter from twelve to eighteen inches  in diameter, we shall be sure to find one or more of these parasites,  hidden away among the numerous folds of the mouth. The body is long  and tapering, having an aperture in the extremity, the whole animal  being like an elongated cone, strongly ribbed from apex to base. At  the base, viz. at the month end, are a few short, stout tentacles.  This Actinia is covered with innumerable little transverse wrinkles  (see Fig. 14), by means of which it fastens itself securely among the  fluted membranes around the mouth of the Jelly-fish. It will live a  considerable time in confinement, attaching itself, for its whole  length, to the vessel in which it is kept, and clinging quite firmly  if any attempt is made to remove it. The general color of the body is  violet or a brownish red, though the wrinkles give it a somewhat  mottled appearance. _Halcampa_. (_Halcampa albida_ AG.)    Strange to say, the Actiniae, which live in the mud, are among the most  beautifully colored of these animals. They frequently prepare their  home with some care, lining their hole by means of the same secretions"]]]
