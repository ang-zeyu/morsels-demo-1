Snout in lateral profile acutely rounded, protruding  beyond tip of lower jaw, in dorsal profile pointed; canthus angular;  loreal region flat; lips thick, barely flared. Snout long; nostrils  slightly protuberant, directed dorsolaterally, situated about two-thirds  distance from anterior corner of eye to tip of snout; internarial  distance 5.6 mm.; internarial area slightly depressed; top of head flat;  interorbital distance 6.0 mm., 30.0 per cent of width of head; width of  eyelid 4.7 mm., 23.5 per cent of width of head. Diameter of eye 6.2 mm.;  heavy dermal fold extending from posterior corner of eye, over upper  edge of tympanum to point above insertion of arm; tympanum distinct, its  diameter 3.4 mm., 54.8 per cent of that of the eye, separated from eye  by distance equal to diameter of tympanum.    Axillary membrane absent; arms moderately robust, lacking dermal fold on  lateral edge of forearm, having transverse fold on wrist; fingers  moderately short, broad; length of fingers from shortest to longest,  1-2-4-3; discs large, that on third finger one-fourth larger than  tympanum; subarticular tubercles large, round, none bifid; supernumerary  tubercles large, granule-like, present only on proximal segments;  prepollex enlarged, not bearing nuptial excrescence. Fingers about  one-half webbed; webbing connects first and second fingers at level of  distal end of antepenultimate phalanx, extending from middle of  penultimate phalanx of second finger to middle of antepenultimate  phalanx of third, and between bases of penultimate phalanges of third  and fourth fingers. Heels overlap by about one-half length of shank when  hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to point between  eye and nostril; thin transverse dermal fold on heel; tarsal fold  strong, extending full length of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle  small, flat, elongate, barely visible from above; outer metatarsal  tubercle small, conical; toes moderately long, stout; length of toes  from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4; discs slightly smaller than those  on fingers; subarticular tubercles large, round, subconical;  supernumerary tubercles large, conical, in single row on proximal  segment of each digit; toes about four-fifths webbed; webbing extending  from base of disc on first to base of disc on second to base of  penultimate phalanx of third toe, from base of disc on third to base of  penultimate phalanx of fourth to base of disc of fifth toe.    Anal opening directed posteroventrally at mid-level of thighs; anal  sheath long, tubular.  Skin smooth on dorsum and on ventral surfaces of  shanks, granular on throat, belly, and ventral surfaces of arms and  thighs. Tongue ovoid, widest posteriorly, neither notched nor free  behind. Prevomerine teeth 6-7, situated on robust transverse ridges  between small, ovoid choanae. Vocal slits absent. Testes large, ovoid,  granular; length of left testis 11.0 mm.    Color (in preservative): brown above with many darker brown spots and  narrow middorsal stripe on back; six or seven dark brown transverse bars  on each segment of hind limbs and four bars on each forearm; flanks  white with dark brown spots; anterior surfaces of thighs creamy white  with brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs dark brown with  creamy yellow flecks; stripe on snout, canthus, edge of upper eyelid,  and supratympanic fold tan; ventral surfaces of feet brown; rest of  venter creamy white; stripe above anus white.    Color (in life): green above with slightly darker green spots; dorsal  surfaces of upper arms and thighs tan with green transverse bars; upper  surfaces of forearms and shanks green with darker green transverse bars;  feet, fourth and fifth toes, and third and fourth fingers tan with brown  transverse bars; other fingers and toes tan with brown flecks. Ventral  surfaces creamy yellow, brightest on throat and chest; flanks and  anterior surfaces of thighs bright creamy yellow with dark brown  reticulations and spots; posterior surfaces of thighs and ventral  surfaces of feet dark brown with yellow flecks; ventral surfaces of  hands and webbing on hands and feet yellowish tan. Labial stripe tan;  stripes on outer edge of forearm, along outer edge of foot, and above  anus cream-color; stripe on canthus, edge of upper eyelid, and on  supratympanic fold bronze-color. Iris pale bronze with black  reticulations and faint median, horizontal copper-colored streak; pupil  horizontally elliptical with ventral notch; palpebral membrane clear  above, pale bluish green with brown reticulations below.    _Variation._--In life all individuals had creamy yellow venters and  yellow flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs with brown or black spots  and mottling. Most of the adults were colored like the holotype, but one  was a much darker olive-green, and one was uniform brown above with a  dark brown middorsal stripe. Most subadults (snout-vent lengths  31.6-50.1 mm.) were pale reddish tan above with darker reddish brown  bars on the limbs and blotches on the back. The side of the head was  dark brown and the stripe along the canthus, edge of upper eyelid, and  supratympanic fold was yellowish tan. Some individuals had a dark brown  middorsal stripe. The posterior surfaces of the thighs were dull  yellowish tan; yellow flecks were present in the larger individuals.    TABLE 2.--Variation in Measurements and Proportions in Hyla altipotens.

The white stripe above the anus and the stripe from the snout  along the side of the head are invariably present. In some of the  largest individuals the brown reticulations on the anterior surface of  the thigh extend onto the ventral surface; in these specimens brown  flecks are present on the ventral surfaces on the shanks.    The tympanum is proportionately larger in females than in males; the  variation in size and proportions is given in Table 2. The total number  of prevomerine teeth varies from 13 to 18 (mean, 15) in five adult males  and from 10 to 12 (mean 11) in two females.    The testes in all adult males are granular, ovoid in shape, and greatly  enlarged. The lengths of the left testis in each of the five males are  11.0 to 23.5 (mean 14.6) mm.    _Comparisons._--On the basis of external appearance and certain cranial  characters (large frontoparietal fontanelle, broad sphenethmoid, large  nasals broadly separated medially having thin lateral processes  articulating with the palatines, short squamosal not articulating with  the maxillary, and quadratojugal present and articulating with the  maxillary), _Hyla altipotens_ can be associated with the _Hyla  taeniopus_ group (Duellman, 1965, Lynch and Smith, 1966). _Hyla  altipotens_ can be distinguished from all of the other members of the  group by its narrow head, pointed snout in both sexes, and uniformly  yellow throat and belly.    Small brown individuals of _Hyla altipotens_ superficially resemble  adult _Hyla pinorum_. The latter species has a covered tympanum, less  webbing on the hands, and a short, blunt snout.    _Remarks._--This stream-breeding frog is like _Hyla taeniopus_ in having  greatly enlarged testes, which possibly through the production of vast  quantities of sperm are an adaptation for successful breeding in  torrential streams (Duellman, 1965:164).    All individuals were found in trees and bushes near streams in cloud  forest at night in February. The type locality is the same as that of  _Hyla pentheter_ and _Hyla thorectes_, discovered by Kraig Adler in  June, 1964. Our field work there in February, 1966, resulted in finding  _Hyla altipotens_, _H. pellita_, and _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_, but  no individuals of the species found by Adler. A visit to the same  locality in August, 1966, revealed no individuals of either _H.  altipotens_ or _pellita_; instead _pentheter_ and _thorectes_ were found  along the stream.    Duellman (1"]]]
