They looked so different when thousands came down  again, to field dressing-stations--the walking wounded and the stretcher  cases, the blind and the gassed--as we saw them on the mornings of  battle, month after month, year after year.    Our work as chroniclers of their acts was not altogether \"soft,\" though  we did not go \"over the top\" or live in the dirty ditches with them. We  had to travel prodigiously to cover the ground between one division and  another along a hundred miles of front, with long walks often at the  journey's end and a wet way back. Sometimes we were soaked to the skin  on the journey home. Often we were so cold and numbed in those long wild  drives up desolate roads that our limbs lost consciousness and the wind  cut into us like knives. We were working against time, always against  time, and another tire-burst would mean that no despatch could be  written of a great battle on the British front, or only a short record  written in the wildest haste when there was so much to tell, so much  to describe, such unforgetable pictures in one's brain of another day's  impressions in the fields and on the roads.    There were five English correspondents and, two years later, two  Americans. On mornings of big battle we divided up the line of front and  drew lots for the particular section which each man would cover. Then  before the dawn, or in the murk of winter mornings, or the first glimmer  of a summer day, our cars would pull out and we would go off separately  to the part of the line allotted to us by the number drawn, to see the  preliminary bombardment, to walk over newly captured ground, to get into  the backwash of prisoners and walking wounded, amid batteries firing  a new barrage, guns moving forward on days of good advance, artillery  transport bringing up new stores of ammunition, troops in support  marching to repel a counter-attack or follow through the new objectives,  ambulances threading their way back through the traffic, with loads  of prostrate men, mules, gunhorses, lorries churning up the mud in  Flanders.    So we gained a personal view of all this activity of strife, and from  many men in its whirlpool details of their own adventure and of  general progress or disaster on one sector of the battle-front. Then in  divisional headquarters we saw the reports of the battle as they came in  by telephone, or aircraft, or pigeon-post, from half-hour to half-hour,  or ten minutes by ten minutes. Three divisions widely separated provided  all the work one war correspondent could do on one day of action, and  later news on a broader scale, could be obtained from corps headquarters  farther back. Tired, hungry, nerve-racked, splashed to the eyes in mud,  or covered in a mask of dust, we started for the journey back to our own  quarters, which we shifted from time to time in order to get as near as  we could to the latest battle-front without getting beyond reach of the  telegraph instruments--by relays of despatch-riders--at \"Signals,\" G. H.  Q., which remained immovably fixed in the rear.    There was a rendezvous in one of our rooms, and each man outlined the  historical narrative of the day upon the front he had covered, reserving  for himself his own adventures, impressions, and emotions.    Time slipped away, and time was short, while the despatch-riders  waited for our unwritten despatches, and censors who had been our  fellow-travelers washed themselves cleaner and kept an eye on the clock.    Time was short while the world waited for our tales of tragedy or  victory... and tempers were frayed, and nerves on edge, among five  men who hated one another, sometimes, with a murderous hatred (though,  otherwise, good comrades) and desired one another's death by slow  torture or poison-gas when they fumbled over notes, written in a jolting  car, or on a battlefield walk, and went into past history in order  to explain present happenings, or became tangled in the numbers of  battalions and divisions.    Percival Phillips turned pink-and-white under the hideous strain of  nervous control, with an hour and a half for two columns in The Morning  Post. A little pulse throbbed in his forehead. His lips were tightly  pressed. His oaths and his anguish were in his soul, but unuttered.  Beach Thomas, the most amiable of men, the Peter Pan who went a  bird-nesting on battlefields, a lover of beauty and games and old poems  and Greek and Latin tags, and all joy in life--what had he to do with  war?--looked bored with an infinite boredom, irritable with a scornful  impatience of unnecessary detail, gazed through his gold-rimmed  spectacles with an air of extreme detachment (when Percy Robinson  rebuilt the map with dabs and dashes on a blank sheet of paper), and  said, \"I've got more than I can write, and The Daily Mail goes early to  press.\"    \"Thanks very much... It's very kind of you.\"    We gathered up our note-books and were punctiliously polite. (Afterward  we were the best of friends.) Thomas was first out of the room, with  short, quick little steps in spite of his long legs. His door banged.  Phillips was first at his typewriter, working it like a machine-gun, in  short, furious spasms of word-fire. I sat down to my typewriter--a  new instrument of torture to me--and coaxed its evil genius with  conciliatory prayers.    \"For dear God's sake,\" I said, \"don't go twisting that blasted ribbon of  yours to-day. I must write this despatch, and I've just an hour when I  want five.\"    Sometimes that Corona was a mechanism of singular sweetness, and I  blessed it with a benediction. But often there was a devil in it which  mocked at me. After the first sentence or two it twisted the ribbon; at  the end of twenty sentences the ribbon was like an angry snake, writhing  and coiling hideously.    I shouted for Mackenzie, the American, a master of these things.    He came in and saw my blanched face, my sweat of anguish, my crise de  nerfs. I could see by his eyes that he understood my stress and had pity  on me.    \"That's all right,\" he said. \"A little patience--\"    By a touch or two he exorcised the devil, laughed, and said: \"Go easy.  You've just about reached breaking--point.\"    I wrote, as we all wrote, fast and furiously, to get down something of  enormous history, word-pictures of things seen, heroic anecdotes, the  underlying meaning of this new slaughter. There was never time to think  out a sentence or a phrase, to touch up a clumsy paragraph, to go back  on a false start, to annihilate a vulgar adjective, to put a touch  of style into one's narrative. One wrote instinctively, blindly,  feverishly... And downstairs were the censors, sending up messages by  orderlies to say \"half-time,\" or \"ten minutes more,\" and cutting  out sometimes the things one wanted most to say, modifying a direct  statement of fact into a vague surmise, taking away the honor due to  the heroic men who had fought and died to-day... Who would be a war  correspondent, or a censor?    So it happened day by day, for five months at a stretch, when big  battles were in progress. It was not an easy life. There were times when  I was so physically and mentally exhausted that I could hardly rouse  myself to a new day's effort. There were times when I was faint and sick  and weak; and my colleagues were like me. But we struggled on to tell  the daily history of the war and the public cursed us because we did not  tell more, or sneered at us because they thought we were \"spoon-fed\" by  G. H. Q.--who never gave us any news and who were far from our way of  life, except when they thwarted us, by petty restrictions and foolish  rules.          VIII      The Commander-in-Chief--Sir John French--received us when we were first  attached to the British armies in the field--a lifetime ago, as it seems  to me now. It was a formal ceremony in the chateau near St.-Omer, which  he used as his own headquarters, with his A. D. C.'s in attendance,  though the main general headquarters were in the town. Our first colonel  gathered us like a shepherd with his flock, counting us twice over  before we passed in. A tall, dark young man, whom I knew afterward to be  Sir Philip Sassoon, received us and chatted pleasantly in a French  salon with folding-doors which shut off an inner room. There were a  few portraits of ladies and gentlemen of France in the days before the  Revolution, like those belonging to that old aristocracy which still  existed, in poverty and pride, in other chateaus in this French  Flanders. There was a bouquet of flowers on the table, giving a sweet  scent to the room, and sunlight streamed through the shutters... I  thought for a moment of the men living in ditches in the salient, under  harassing fire by day and night. Their actions and their encounters with  death were being arranged, without their knowledge, in this sunny little  chateau....    The folding-doors opened and Sir John French came in. He wore top-boots  and spurs, and after saying, \"Good day, gentlemen,\" stood with his legs  apart, a stocky, soldierly figure, with a square head and heavy jaw. I  wondered whether there were any light of genius in him--any inspiration,  any force which would break the awful strength of the enemy against us,  any cunning in modern warfare.    He coughed a little, and made us a speech. I forget his words, but  remember the gist of them. He was pleased to welcome us within his army,  and trusted to our honor and loyalty. He made an allusion to the power  of the press, and promised us facilities for seeing and writing,  within the bounds of censorship. I noticed that he pronounced St.-Omer,  St.-Omar, as though Omar Khayyam had been canonized. He said, \"Good day,  gentlemen,\" again, and coughed huskily again to clear his throat, and  then went back through the folding-doors.    I saw him later, during the battle of Loos, after its ghastly failure.  He was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#5)"],[1,"excepted,  which lay at the bottom, and that was HOPE.  So we see at this  day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us;  and while we have THAT, no amount of other ills can make us  completely wretched.    Another story is, that Pandora was sent in good faith, by  Jupiter, to bless man; that she was furnished with a box,  containing her marriage presents, into which every god had put  some blessing.  She opened the box incautiously, and the  blessings all escaped, HOPE only excepted.  This story seems more  consistent than the former; for how could HOPE, so precious a  jewel as it is, have been kept in a jar full of all manner of  evils?    The world being thus furnished with inhabitants, the first age  was an age of innocence and happiness, called the GOLDEN AGE.  Truth and right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor was  there any magistrate to threaten or punish.  The forest had not  yet been robbed of its trees to furnish timbers for vessels, nor  had men built fortifications round their towns.  There were no  such things as swords, spears, or helmets.  The earth brought  forth all things necessary for man, without his labor in  ploughing or sowing.  Perpetual spring reigned, flowers sprang up  without seed, the rivers flowed with milk and wine, and yellow  honey distilled from the oaks.      \"But when good Saturn, banished from above,    Was driven to hell, the world was under Jove.    Succeeding times a Silver Age behold,    Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold.    Then summer, autumn, winter did appear,    And spring was but a season of the year.    The sun his annual course obliquely made,    Good days contracted and enlarged the bad,    Then air, with sultry heats, began to glow;    The wings of winds were clogged with ice and sno    And shivering mortals into houses driven,    Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven.    Those houses then were caves, or homely sheds;    With twining osiers fenced; and moss their beds.    Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke,    And oxen labored first beneath the yoke.    To this came next in course the Brazen Age:    A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,    Not impious yet! . .    . . . Hard Steel succeeded then;    And stubborn as the metal were the men.\"    Ovid's Metam, Book I.  Dryden's Translation.    Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and honor fled.  In  their places came fraud and cunning, violence, and the wicked  love of gain.  Then seamen spread sails to the wind, and the  trees were torn from the mountains to serve for keels to ships,  and vex the face of ocean.  The earth, which till now had been  cultivated in common, began to be divided off into possessions.  Men were not satisfied with what the surface produced, but must  dig into its bowels, and draw forth from thence the ores of  metals.  Mischievous IRON, and more mischievous GOLD, were  produced.  War sprang up, using both as weapons; the guest was  not safe in his friend's house; and sons-in-law and fathers-in-  law, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, could not trust  one another.  Sons wished their fathers dead, that they might  come to the inheritance; family love lay prostrate.  The earth  was wet with slaughter, and the gods abandoned it, one by one,  till Astraea [the goddess of innocence and purity.  After leaving  earth, she was placed among the stars, where she became the  constellation Virgo  The Virgin.  Themis (Justice) was the mother  of Astraea.  She is represented as holding aloft a pair of  scales, in which she weighs the claims of opposing parties.  It  was a favorite idea of the old poets, that these goddesses would  one day return, and bring back the Golden Age.  Even in a  Christian Hymn, the Messiah of Pope, this idea occurs.      \"All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail,    Returning Justice lift aloft her scale,    Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,    And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend.\"  See, also,    Milton's Hymn on the nativity, stanzas xiv, and xv] alone was        left, and finally she also took her departure.    Jupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger.  He  summoned the gods to council.  They obeyed the call, and took  The road to the palace of heaven.  The road, which any one may  see in a clear night, stretches across the face of the sky, and  is called the Milky Way.  Along the road stand the palaces of the  illustrious gods; the common people of the skies live apart, on  either side.  Jupiter addressed the assembly.  He set forth the  frightful condition of things on the earth, and closed by  announcing his intention to destroy the whole of its inhabitants,  and provide a new race, unlike the first, who would be more  worthy of life, and much better worshippers of   the gods.  So  saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the  world, and destroy it by burning it; but recollecting the danger  that such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he  changed his plan, and resolved to drown the world.  Aquilo, the  north wind, which scatters the clouds, was chained up; Notus, the  south, was sent out, and soon covered all the face of heaven with  a cloak of pitchy darkness.  The clouds, driven together, resound  with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are laid low; the  year's labor of the husbandman perishes in an hour.  Jupiter, not  satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother Neptune to  aid him with his.  He lets loose the rivers, and pours them over  the land.  At the same time, he heaves the land with an  earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the  shores.  Flocks, herds, men, and houses are swept away, and  temples, with their sacred enclosures, profaned.  If any edifice  remained standing, it was overwhelmed, and its turrets lay hid  beneath the waves.  Now all was sea; sea without shore.  Here and  there some one remained on a projecting hill-top, and a few, in  boats, pulled the oar where they had lately driven the plough.  The fishes swim among the tree-tops; the anchor is let down into  a garden.  Where the graceful lambs played but now, unwieldy sea-  calves gambol.  The wolf swims among the sheep; the yellow lions  and tigers struggle in the water.  The strength of the wild boar  serves him not, nor his swiftness the stag.  The birds fall with  weary wing into the water, having found no land for a resting  place.  Those living beings whom the water spared fell a prey to  hunger.    Parnassus alone, of all the mountains, overtopped the waves; and  there Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, of the race of Prometheus,  found refuge   he a just man, and she a faithful worshipper of  the gods.  Jupiter, when he saw none left alive but this pair,  and remembered their harmless lives and pious demeanor, ordered  the north winds to drive away the clouds, and disclose the skies  to earth, and earth to the skies.  Neptune also directed Triton  to blow on his shell, and sound a retreat to the waters.  The  waters obeyed, and the sea returned to its shores, and the rivers  to their channels.  Then Deucalion thus addressed Pyrrha: \"O  wife, only surviving woman, joined to me first by the ties of  kindred and marriage, and now by a common danger, would that we  possessed the power of our ancestor Prometheus, and could renew  the race as he at first made it!  But as we cannot, let us seek  yonder temple, and inquire of the gods what remains for us to  do.\"  They entered the temple, deformed as it was with slime, and  approached the altar, where no fire burned.  There they fell  prostrate on the earth, and prayed the goddess to inform them how  they might retrieve their miserable affairs.  The oracle  answered, \"Depart from the temple with head veiled and garments  unbound, and cast behind you the bones of your mother.\"  They  heard the words with astonishment.  Pyrrha first broke silence:  \"We cannot obey; we dare not profane the remains of our parents.\"  They sought the thickest shades of the wood, and revolved the  oracle in their minds.  At length Deucalion spoke: \"Either my  sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we may obey without  impiety.  The earth is the great parent of all; the stones are  her bones; these we may cast behind us; and I think this is what  the oracle means.  At least, it will do no harm to try.\"  They  veiled their faces, unbound their garments, and picked up stones,  and cast them behind them.  The stones (wonderful to relate)  began to grow soft, and assume shape.  By degrees, they put on a  rude resemblance to the human form, like a block half finished in  the hands of the sculptor.  The moisture and slime that were  about them became flesh; the stony part became bones; the veins  remained veins, retaining their name, only changing their use.  Those thrown by the hand of the man became men, and those by the  woman became women.  It was a hard race, and well adapted to  labor, as we find ourselves to be at this day, giving plain  indications of our origin.    The comparison of Eve to Pandora is too obvious to have escaped  Milton, who introduces it in Book IV, of Paradise Lost:--      \"More lovely than Pandora, whom the gods    Endowed with all their gifts; and O, too like    In sad event, when to the unwiser son    Of Jupiter, brought by Hermes, she ensnared    Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged    On him who had stole Jove's authentic fire.\"    Prometheus and Epimetheus were sons of Iapetus, which Milton  changes to Japhet.    Prometheus, the Titan son of Iapetus and Themis, is a favorite  subject with the poets.  AEschylus wrote three tragedies on the  subjects of his confinement, his release, and his worship at  Athens.  Of these only the first is preserved, the Prometheus  Bound.  Prometheus was the only one in the council of the gods  who favored man.  He alone was kind to the human race, and taught  and protected them.      \"I formed his mind,    And "]]]
