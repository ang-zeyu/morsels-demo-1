[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/462"],[0,"The Errand Boy; Or, How Phil Brent Won Success (#5)"],[1,"confessed that Phil was considerably impressed by the  professional character of Signor Orlando. He had never met an actor,  or public performer of any description, and was disposed to have a high  respect for a man who filled such a conspicuous position. There was not,  to be sure, anything very impressive about Signor Orlando's appearance.  His face did not indicate talent, and his dress was shabby. But for all  that he was a man familiar with the public--a man of gifts.    \"I should like to see you on the stage,\" said Phil respectfully.    \"So you shall, my dear boy--so you shall. I'll get you a pass from Mr.  Bowerman. Which way are you going?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Phil, puzzled. \"I should like to find a cheap  boarding-house, but I don't know the city.\"    \"I do,\" answered Signor Orlando promptly. \"Why not come to my house?\"    \"Have you a house?\"    \"I mean my boarding-house. It's some distance away. Suppose we take a  horse-car?\"    \"All right!\" answered Phil, relieved to find a guide in the labyrinth of  the great city.    \"I live on Fifth Street, near the Bowery--a very convenient location,\"  said Orlando, if we may take the liberty to call him thus.    \"Fifth Avenue?\" asked Phil, who did not know the difference.    \"Oh, no; that's a peg above my style. I am not a Vanderbilt, nor yet an  Astor.\"    \"Is the price moderate?\" asked Phil anxiously. \"I must make my money  last as long as I can, for I don't know when I shall get a place.\"    \"To be sure. You might room with me, only I've got a hall bedroom.  Perhaps we might manage it, though.\"    \"I think I should prefer a room by myself,\" said Phil, who reflected  that Signor Orlando was a stranger as yet.    \"Oh, well, I'll speak to the old lady, and I guess she can accommodate  you with a hall bedroom like mine on the third floor.\"    \"What should I have to pay?\"    \"A dollar and a quarter a week, and you can get your meals where you  please.\"    \"I think that will suit me,\" said Phil thoughtfully.    After leaving the car, a minute's walk brought them to a shabby  three-story house of brick. There was a stable opposite, and a group of  dirty children were playing in front of it.    \"This is where I hang out,\" said Signor Orlando cheerfully. \"As the poet  says, there is no place like home.\"    If this had been true it was not much to be regretted, since the home in  question was far from attractive.    Signor Orlando rang the bell, and a stout woman of German aspect  answered the call.    \"So you haf come back, Herr Orlando,\" said this lady. \"I hope you haf  brought them two weeks' rent you owe me.\"    \"All in good time, Mrs. Schlessinger,\" said Orlando. \"But you see I have  brought some one with me.\"    \"Is he your bruder now?\" asked the lady.    \"No, he is not, unfortunately for me. His name is----\"    Orlando coughed.    \"Philip Brent,\" suggested our hero.    \"Just so--Philip Brent.\"    \"I am glad to see Mr. Prent,\" said the landlady.    \"And is he an actor like you, Signor Orlando?\"    \"Not yet. We don't know what may happen. But he comes on business, Mrs.  Schlessinger. He wants a room.\"    The landlady brightened up. She had two rooms vacant, and a new lodger  was a godsend.    \"I vill show Mr. Prent what rooms I haf,\" she said. \"Come up-stairs, Mr.  Prent.\"    The good woman toiled up the staircase panting, for she was asthmatic,  and Phil followed. The interior of the house was as dingy as the  exterior, and it was quite dark on the second landing.    She threw open the door of a back room, which, being lower than the  hall, was reached by a step.    \"There!\" said she, pointing to the faded carpet, rumpled bed, and cheap  pine bureau, with the little six-by-ten looking-glass surmounting it.  \"This is a peautiful room for a single gentleman, or even for a man and  his wife.\"    \"My friend, Mr. Brent, is not married,\" said Signor Orlando waggishly.    Phil laughed.    \"You will have your shoke, Signor Orlando,\" said Mrs. Schlessinger.    \"What is the price of this room?\" asked Phil.    \"Three dollars a week, Mr. Prent, I ought to have four, but since you  are a steady young gentleman----\"    \"How does she know that?\" Phil wondered.    \"Since you are a steady young gentleman, and a friend of Signor Orlando,  I will not ask you full price.\"    \"That is more than I can afford to pay,\" said Phil, shaking his head.    \"I think you had better show Mr. Brent the hall bedroom over mine,\"  suggested the signor.    Mrs. Schlessinger toiled up another staircase, the two new acquaintances  following her. She threw open the door of one of those depressing cells  known in New York as a hall bedroom. It was about five feet wide and  eight feet long, and was nearly filled up by a cheap bedstead, covered  by a bed about two inches thick, and surmounted at the head by a  consumptive-looking pillow. The paper was torn from the walls in places.  There was one rickety chair, and a wash-stand which bore marks of  extreme antiquity.    \"This is a very neat room for a single gentleman,\" remarked Mrs.  Schlessinger.    Phil's spirits fell as he surveyed what was to be his future home. It  was a sad contrast to his neat, comfortable room at home.    \"Is this room like yours, Signor Orlando?\" he asked faintly.    \"As like as two peas,\" answered Orlando.    \"Would you recommend me to take it?\"    \"You couldn't do better.\"    How could the signor answer otherwise in presence of a landlady to whom  he owed two weeks' rent?    \"Then,\" said Phil, with a secret shudder, \"I'll take it if the rent is  satisfactory.\"    \"A dollar and a quarter a week,\" said Mrs. Schlessinger promptly.    \"I'll take it for a week.\"    \"You won't mind paying in advance?\" suggested the landlady. \"I pay my  own rent in advance.\"    Phil's answer was to draw a dollar and a quarter from his purse and pass  it to his landlady.    \"I'll take possession now,\" said our hero. \"Can I have some water to  wash my face?\"    Mrs. Schlessinger was evidently surprised that any one should want to  wash in the middle of the day, but made no objections.    When Phil had washed his face and hands, he went out with Signor Orlando  to dine at a restaurant on the Bowery.        CHAPTER VII.    BOWERMAN'S VARIETIES.    The restaurant to which he was taken by Signor Orlando was thronged with  patrons, for it was one o'clock. On the whole, they did not appear  to belong to the highest social rank, though they were doubtless  respectable. The table-cloths were generally soiled, and the waiters had  a greasy look. Phil said nothing, but he did not feel quite so hungry as  before he entered.    The signor found two places at one of the tables, and they sat down.  Phil examined a greasy bill of fare and found that he could obtain a  plate of meat for ten cents. This included bread and butter, and a dish  of mashed potato. A cup of tea would be five cents additional.    \"I can afford fifteen cents for a meal,\" he thought, and called for a  plate of roast beef.    \"Corn beef and cabbage for me,\" said the signor.    \"It's very filling,\" he remarked aside to Phil.    \"They won't give you but a mouthful of beef.\"    So it proved, but the quality was such that Phil did not care for more.  He ordered a piece of apple pie afterward feeling still hungry.      \"I see you're bound to have a square meal,\" said the signor.    After Phil had had it, he was bound to confess that he did not feel  uncomfortably full. Yet he had spent twice as much as the signor, who  dispensed with the tea and pie as superfluous luxuries.    In the evening Signor Orlando bent his steps toward Bowerman's  Varieties.    \"I hope in a day or two to get a complimentary ticket for you, Mr.  Brent,\" he said.    \"How much is the ticket?\" asked Phil.    \"Fifteen cents. Best reserved seats twenty-five cents.'    \"I believe I will be extravagant for once,\" said Phil, \"and go at my own  expense.\"    \"Good!\" said the signor huskily. \"You'll feel repaid I'll be bound.  Bowerman always gives the public their money's worth. The performance  begins at eight o'clock and won't be out until half-past eleven.\"    \"Less than five cents an hour,\" commented Phil.    \"What a splendid head you've got!\" said Signor Orlando admiringly. \"I  couldn't have worked that up. Figures ain't my province.\"    It seemed to Phil rather a slender cause for compliment, but he said  nothing, since it seemed clear that the computation was beyond his  companion's ability.    As to the performance, it was not refined, nor was the talent employed  first-class. Still Phil enjoyed himself after a fashion. He had never  had it in his power to attend many amusements, and this was new to him.  He naturally looked with interest for the appearance of his new friend  and fellow-lodger.    Signor Orlando appeared, dressed in gorgeous array, sang a song which  did credit to the loudness of his voice rather than its quality, and  ended by a noisy clog-dance which elicited much applause from the boys  in the gallery, who shared the evening's entertainment for the moderate  sum of ten cents.    The signor was called back to the stage. He bowed his thanks and gave  another dance. Then he was permitted to retire. As this finished his  part of the entertainment he afterward came around in citizen's dress,  and took a seat in the auditorium beside Phil.    \"How did you like me, Mr. Brent?\" he asked complacently.    \"I thought you did well, Signor Orlando. You were much applauded.\"    \"Yes, the audience is very loyal,\" said the proud performer.    Two half-grown boys heard Phil pronounce the name of his companion, and  they gazed awe-stricken at the famous man.    \"That's Signor Orlando!\" whispered one of the others.    \"I know it,\" was the reply.    \"Such is fame,\" said the Signor, in a pleased tone to Phil. \"People  point me out on the streets.\"    \"Very gratifying, no doubt,\" said our hero, but it occurred to him that  he would not care to be pointed out as a performer at Bowerman's. Signor  Orlando, however, well-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#5)"],[1,"manner, he took the  position that the New Testament account of miracles was inspired, and  therefore beyond the reach of criticism.    So likewise I say, orthodox Christians were disposed to meet  the application of this principle of Historical Criticism under  consideration. They protested against the application of it to sacred  history. They insisted that the marvelous occurrences related in the  Bible, and which read so much like myth or legend, were recorded  by inspired writers, hence above criticism. The exception pleaded,  however, was not granted. There were bold spirits both within the  church as well as outside of it, who did not hesitate, at least so  far as the Old Testament was concerned, to apply the new methods of  criticism to sacred history.    The conclusions of those who started with the hypothesis that what we  call the miraculous is impossible, would not be difficult to forecast.  From the outset, with them, the Old Testament was doomed. In the  wonderful incidents related as the experience of the patriarchs, of  Moses, Aaron, Joshua and the kings and prophets of Israel, this school  of critics could discern a striking parallel to the legends of Rome, of  Greece and Egypt; and as readily rejected the one as the other. They  rejected also the cosmogony of Genesis, insisting that it was not the  history of the creation but poetry, and as such must be regarded, but  not as fact.    Suspicion once cast upon the historical value of sacred writings, the  critics grew bolder and declared that portions of the sacred narrative  presented the appearance of being simply myths; and from this by  degrees it soon became the fashion to attach a legendary character  to the whole of the Old Testament. It was decided by the same class  of critics that the whole narrative, in the main, rests upon oral  tradition and that that tradition was not written until long after  the supposed events occurred. Moreover, when the old traditions were  written, the work was done by poets bent rather on glorifying their  country than upon recording facts; and it is claimed that at times they  did not hesitate to allow imagination to amplify the oral traditions  or at need to invent new occurrences, to fill up blanks in their  annals. The authorship of the sacred books was held to be a matter of  great uncertainty, as well as the date at which they were written; but  certainly they were not written until long after the dates usually  assigned for their production. This style of criticism not only got rid  of the cosmogony of Genesis, but discredited as histories the whole  collection of books comprising the Old Testament. The Fall of man, that  fact which gives meaning to the atonement of Christ, and without which  the scheme of Christian salvation is but an idle fable--was regarded as  merely a myth. So, too, were the revelations of God to the patriarchs;  his communion with Enoch; his warning to Noah, together with the story  of the flood; the building of Babel's tower; the visions of Abraham;  the calling of Moses; the splendid display of God's power in the  deliverance of Israel from bondage; the law written upon the tables of  stone by the finger of God, the ark of the covenant and the visible  presence of God with Israel; the visitation of angels to the prophets;  their communion with God and the messages of reproof, of warning or  of comfort they brought to the people--all, all were myths, distorted  legends, uncertain traditions told by ecstatic poets, falsely esteemed  prophets! Such was the wreck which this new science of criticism made  of the Old Testament.    There was scarcely a halt between the wrecking of the Old Testament  by this new school of critics and their assault upon the New. Their  success gave them confidence, and they attacked the Christian documents  with more vigor than they had the Old Testament. By research which did  not need to be very extensive in order to conduct them to the facts,  they discovered that the age which witnessed the rise of the Christian  religion was one in which there existed a strong preconception in favor  of miracles; that is, the miraculous was universally believed, and it  was held by our new school of critics that this pre-conception in favor  of miracles influenced the writers of the New Testament to insert them  in their narratives.    Ever present in their New Testament criticism as in that of the  Old, was the cardinal principle that miracles never take place--the  miraculous is the impossible; [19] hence whenever our anti-miracle  critics found accounts of miracles interwoven in the biographies of  Jesus, or in the epistles of the apostles, they inexorably relegated  them to the sphere of myth or legend. [20]    Unhappily for orthodox believers who cling to the gospel narratives  as reliable statements of fact, they themselves found it necessary to  discard as apocryphal many of the books and writings which sprang into  existence in the early Christian centuries; books which pretended to  relate incidents in the life of Messiah, especially those which treated  of his childhood and youth. The marvelous account of his moulding  oxen, asses, birds and other figures out of clay, which at his command  would walk or fly away; his power to turn his playmates into kids; his  striking dead with a curse the boys who offended him; his stretching  a short board to its requisite length; his silencing those who try to  teach him [21]--all this, and much more, Christians had to discard as  pure fable. But they stopped short with the pruning process at the  books of the New Testament as we now have them.    Our new school of critics, however, infatuated with the chief principle  of their new science, went right on with the pruning, and made as sad  work of the New Testament as they had with the Old. They rejected the  miraculous in the New Testament writings as well as the account of  miracles which the Christians themselves rejected in the apocryphal  writings. By this step they got rid of the story of the miraculous  conception and birth of Christ; of the journey of the vision-led  magi; of the dream-led Joseph; of the testimony of the Holy Ghost,  and of the Father at Christ's baptism; of converting water into wine;  of Christ walking upon the water; of the miraculously fed multitude;  of the healing of the sick by a word or with a touch; casting out  devils; the raising of the dead; the earthquake; the rending of the  vail of the temple; and the miraculous three hours' darkness at the  crucifixion; Christ's resurrection from the dead; his appearance  after the resurrection; his final ascension into heaven; and the  declaration of the two angels that he would come again to the earth as  he had left it: in the clouds of heaven and in great glory. The new  criticism got rid of all this--all that makes Christ God, or one of  the persons of the Godhead, or that ascribes to him powers above those  that may be possessed by a man. Christ's divinity is destroyed by this  method of criticism, and one instinctively asks what there is left,  and is told--\"The manifestations of the God concealed in the depths  of the human conscience.\" [22] \"God-man, eternally incarnate, not an  individual but an idea!\" [23]    To this then it comes at last, a Christianity without a Christ--that  is, without a divine Christ; and a Christ not divine--not God manifest  in the flesh, is no Christ. We had trusted that Jesus of Nazareth  had been he who would have redeemed not only all Israel, but all the  nations of the earth. We and our fathers had believed that he had  brought life and immortality to light through the gospel; but alas! it  turns out according to our new school of critics, that his \"revelations  of blissful scenes of existence beyond death and the grave, are but  one of the many impostures which time after time have been palmed off  on credulous mankind!\" Christ but a man, \"the moralist and teacher of  Capernaum and Gennesaret\"--nothing more! On a level with Socrates,  or Hillel, or Philo! What a void this new school of criticism makes!  A Christianity without the assurance of the resurrection! without  the hope of the glorious return of the Messiah, to reward every man  according to his works!    The new school of critics does not question so severely as other  critics have done the authenticity of the Christian documents, or the  date of their origin. Indeed, one of their chief apostles concedes the  authenticity of the gospels and their antiquity. [24] But after having  admitted the authenticity and antiquity of the Christian documents,  they then proceed to mutilate the story they relate--the gospel they  teach--as to render it practically valueless to mankind. This is  accomplished by regarding the Christian documents as legends, [25]  from which if we would arrive at historical truth must be excluded  all that is miraculous, [26] and hence all that makes Christ God. And  while to the imagination of the idealist much that is of value and  that is beautiful may remain in the attenuated Christianity which  the new criticism would leave us, yet for the great body of humanity  such a Christianity would be worthless. For however beautiful the  moral precepts of the merely human Jesus may be, they will have no  perceptible influence on the lives of the multitude unless back of  them stands divine authority, accompanied by a conviction of the fact  of man's immortality and his accountability to God for his conduct.  Shorn of these parts, what remains may be beautiful; but it would  be as the beauty of a man from whom the spark of life had fled--the  beauty of the dead. Of course the orthodox Christian denies that this  style of attack on the Christian religion has had any success. To him  it is an \"attack\" which has \"failed.\" \"In spite of all the efforts of  an audacious criticism,\" says one, \"as ignorant as bold--the truth of  the sacred narrative stands firm, the stronger for the"]]]
