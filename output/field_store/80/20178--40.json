If men  felt, as Arrian tells us, that it was a calamity to die without  having seen the Zeus of Olympia; that was because they experienced  the impress there of that which the eye and the whole being of man  love to find above him; and the genius of Pheidias had availed to  shed, upon the gold and ivory of the physical form, the blandness,  the breadth, the smile of the open sky; the mild [31] heat of it  still coming and going, in the face of the father of all the children  of sunshine and shower; as if one of the great white clouds had  composed itself into it, and looked down upon them thus, out of the  midsummer noonday: so that those things might be felt as warm, and  fresh, and blue, by the young and the old, the weak and the strong,  who came to sun themselves in the god's presence, as procession and  hymn rolled on, in the fragrant and tranquil courts of the great  Olympian temple; while all the time those people consciously  apprehended in the carved image of Zeus none but the personal, and  really human, characteristics.    Or think, again, of the Zeus of Dodona.  The oracle of Dodona, with  its dim grove of oaks, and sounding instruments of brass to husband  the faintest whisper in the leaves, was but a great consecration of  that sense of a mysterious will, of which people still feel, or seem  to feel, the expression, in the motions of the wind, as it comes and  goes, and which makes it, indeed, seem almost more than a mere symbol  of the spirit within us.  For Zeus was, indeed, the god of the winds  also; Aeolus, their so-called god, being only his mortal minister, as  having come, by long study of them, through signs in the fire and the  like, to have a certain communicable skill regarding them, in  relation to practical uses.  Now, suppose a Greek sculptor to have  proposed to himself to present [32] to his worshippers the image of  this Zeus of Dodona, who is in the trees and on the currents of the  air.  Then, if he had been a really imaginative sculptor, working as  Pheidias worked, the very soul of those moving, sonorous creatures  would have passed through his hand, into the eyes and hair of the  image; as they can actually pass into the visible expression of those  who have drunk deeply of them; as we may notice, sometimes, in our  walks on mountain or shore.    Victory again--Niké--associated so often with Zeus--on the top of his  staff, on the foot of his throne, on the palm of his extended hand--  meant originally, mythologic science tells us, only the great victory  of the sky, the triumph of morning over darkness.  But that physical  morning of her origin has its ministry to the later aesthetic sense  also.  For if Niké, when she appears in company with the mortal, and  wholly fleshly hero, in whose chariot she stands to guide the horses,  or whom she crowns with her garland of parsley or bay, or whose names  she writes on a shield, is imaginatively conceived, it is because the  old skyey influences are still not quite suppressed in her clear-set  eyes, and the dew of the morning still clings to her wings and her  floating hair.    The office of the imagination, then, in Greek sculpture, in its  handling of divine persons, is thus to condense the impressions of  natural things into human form; to retain that early mystical sense  of water, or wind, or light, in the [33] moulding of eye and brow; to  arrest it, or rather, perhaps, to set it free, there, as human  expression.  The body of man, indeed, was for the Greeks, still the  genuine work of Prometheus; its connexion with earth and air asserted  in many a legend, not shaded down, as with us, through innumerable  stages of descent, but direct and immediate; in precise contrast to  our physical theory of our life, which never seems to fade, dream  over it as we will, out of the light of common day.  The oracles with  their messages to human intelligence from birds and springs of water,  or vapours of the earth, were a witness to that connexion.  Their  story went back, as they believed, with unbroken continuity, and in  the very places where their later life was lived, to a past,  stretching beyond, yet continuous with, actual memory, in which  heaven and earth mingled; to those who were sons and daughters of  stars, and streams, and dew; to an ancestry of grander men and women,  actually clothed in, or incorporate with, the qualities and  influences of those objects; and we can hardly over-estimate the  influence on the Greek imagination of this mythical connexion with  the natural world, at not so remote a date, and of the solemnising  power exercised thereby over their thoughts.  In this intensely  poetical situation, the historical Greeks, the Athenians of the age  of Pericles, found themselves; it was as if the actual roads on which  men daily walk, went up and on, into a visible wonderland.    [34] With such habitual impressions concerning the body, the physical  nature of man, the Greek sculptor, in his later day, still free in  imagination, through the lingering influence of those early dreams,  may have more easily infused into human form the sense of sun, or  lightning, or cloud, to which it was so closely akin, the spiritual  flesh allying itself happily to mystical meanings, and readily  expressing seemingly unspeakable qualities.  But the human form is a  limiting influence also; and in proportion as art impressed human  form, in sculpture or in the drama, on the vaguer conceptions of the  Greek mind, there was danger of an escape from them of the free  spirit of air, and light, and sky.  Hence, all through the history of  Greek art, there is a struggle, a Streben, as the Germans say,  between the palpable and limited human form, and the floating essence  it is to contain.  On the one hand, was the teeming, still fluid  world, of old beliefs, as we see it reflected in the somewhat  formless theogony of Hesiod; a world, the Titanic vastness of which  is congruous with a certain sublimity of speech, when he has to  speak, for instance, of motion or space; as the Greek language itself  has a primitive copiousness and energy of words, for wind, fire,  water, cold, sound--attesting a deep susceptibility to the  impressions of those things--yet with edges, most often, melting into  each other.  On the other hand, there was that limiting, controlling  tendency, [35] identified with the Dorian influence in the history of  the Greek mind, the spirit of a severe and wholly self-conscious  intelligence; bent on impressing everywhere, in the products of the  imagination, the definite, perfectly conceivable human form, as the  only worthy subject of art; less in sympathy with the mystical  genealogies of Hesiod, than with the heroes of Homer, ending in the  entirely humanised religion of Apollo, the clearly understood  humanity of the old Greek warriors in the marbles of Aegina.  The  representation of man, as he is or might be, became the aim of  sculpture, and the achievement of this the subject of its whole  history; one early carver had opened the eyes, another the lips, a  third had given motion to the feet; in various ways, in spite of the  retention of archaic idols, the genuine human expression had come,  with the truthfulness of life itself.    These two tendencies, then, met and struggled and were harmonised in  the supreme imagination, of Pheidias, in sculpture--of Aeschylus, in  the drama.  Hence, a series of wondrous personalities, of which the  Greek imagination became the dwelling-place; beautiful, perfectly  understood human outlines, embodying a strange, delightful, lingering  sense of clouds and water and sun.  Such a world, the world of really  imaginative Greek sculpture, we still see, reflected in many a humble  vase or battered coin, in Bacchante, and Centaur, and Amazon; [36]  evolved out of that \"vasty deep\"; with most command, in the  consummate fragments of the Parthenon; not, indeed, so that he who  runs may read, the gifts of Greek sculpture being always delicate,  and asking much of the receiver; but yet visible, and a pledge to us,  of creative power, as, to the worshipper, of the presence, which,  without that material pledge, had but vaguely haunted the fields and  groves.    This, then, was what the Greek imagination did for men's sense and  experience of natural forces, in Athene, in Zeus, in Poseidon; for  men's sense and experience of their own bodily qualities--swiftness,  energy, power of concentrating sight and hand and foot on a momentary  physical act--in the close hair, the chastened muscle, the perfectly  poised attention of the quoit-player; for men's sense, again, of  ethical qualities--restless idealism, inward vision, power of  presence through that vision in scenes behind the experience of  ordinary men--in the idealised Alexander.    To illustrate this function of the imagination, as especially  developed in Greek art, we may reflect on what happens with us in the  use of certain names, as expressing summarily, this name for you and  that for me--Helen, Gretchen, Mary--a hundred associations, trains of  sound, forms, impressions, remembered in all sorts of degrees, which,  through a very wide and full experience, they have the power of  bringing with [37] them; in which respect, such names are but  revealing instances of the whole significance, power, and use of  language in general.  Well,--the mythical conception, projected at  last, in drama or sculpture, is the name, the instrument of the  identification, of the given matter,--of its unity in variety, its  outline or definition in mystery; its spiritual form, to use again  the expression I have borrowed from William Blake--form, with hands,  and lips, and opened eyelids--spiritual, as conveying to us, in that,  the soul of rain, or of a Greek river, or of swiftness, or purity.

The time is short, it is  true, for it must be performed about the middle of September; but  the circumstances connected with the performances, and a number  of other purposes, are of such a character that they enliven my  spirits in such a degree that I hurry to my writing desk and  remain seated there with great joy.\"    (Vienna, August 1, 1781, to his father. The opera referred to is  \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.\" The \"circumstances\" were the  court festivals which were to celebrate the coming of the Russian  Grand Duke, from which Mozart, as was his wont, expected all  manner of future benefits.)    38. \"As regards the work of Stephanie you are right, of course,  but nevertheless the poetry is well fitted to the character of  the stupid, coarse and malicious Osmin. I know full well that the  style of the verse is none of the best, but it has so adjusted  itself to the musical thoughts (which were promenading in my  brain in advance) that the lines had to please me, and I will  wager there will be no disappointment at the performance. So far  as the songs are concerned they are not to be despised. Belmont's  aria 'O, wie angstlich' could scarcely have been written better  for music.\"    (Vienna, October 13, 1781, to his father. Stephanie was the  author of the libretto of \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.\")    39. \"An aria has been written for Osmin in the first act....You  have seen only the beginning and end of it, which must be  effective; the rage of Osmin is made ridiculous by the use of  Turkish music. In developing the aria I have given him (Fischer,  a bass) a chance to show his beautiful low tones. The 'By the  beard of the Prophet' remains in the same tempo but has quicker  notes, and as his anger grows continually, when one thinks that  the aria is come to an end, the Allegro assai must make the best  kind of an effect when it enters in a different measure and key.  Here is the reason: a man who is in such a violent rage oversteps  all order, all moderation; he forgets himself, and the music must  do the same.    \"Inasmuch as the passions, whether violent or not, must never be  carried in their expression to the verge of disgust, and music,  even in the most awful situations must not offend the ear but  always please, consequently always remain music, I have not  chosen a key foreign to F (i.e. the key of the aria), but a  related one,--not the nearest, D minor, but the more distant, A  minor. You know how I have given expression to Belmont's aria,  'O, wie angstlich, O wie feurig,'--there is a suggestion of the  beating heart,--the violins in octaves. This is the favorite aria  of all who have heard it,--of myself, as well,--and is written  right into the voice of Adamberger. One can see the reeling and  trembling, one can see the heaving breast which is illustrated by  a crescendo; one hears the lispings and sighs expressed by the  muted violins with flute in unison. The Janizary chorus is, as  such, all that could be asked, short and jolly, written to suit  the Viennese.\"    (Vienna, September 26, 1781, to his father. Concerning the  composition of \"Die Entfuhrung,\" Mozart delivered himself at  greater length and more explicitly than about any other opera.  From the above excerpt one can learn his notions touching musical  characterization and delineation. [\"Turkish\" music, or \"Janizary\"  music, is that in which the percussion effects of Oriental music  are imitated--music utilizing the large drum, cymbals, etc.  H.E.K.])    40. \"The close will make a deal of noise; and that is all that  is necessary for the end of an act;--the noisier the better, the  shorter the better, so that the people shall not get too cool to  applaud.\"    (Vienna, September 26, 1781, to his father. The Trio at the end  of the first act is the finale referred to.)    41. \"My opera is to be performed again next Friday, but I have  protested against it as I do not want it to be ridden to death at  once. The public, I may say, are daft about this opera. It does a  fellow good to receive such applause.\"    (Vienna, July 27, 1782, to his father.)    42. \"My opera was performed again yesterday, this time at the  request of Gluck. Gluck paid me many compliments on it. I am to  dine with him tomorrow.\"    (Vienna, August 7, 1782, to his father. [How Mozart and Gluck  differed in principle on the relation between text and music the  reader has already had an opportunity to learn. H.E.K.])    43. \"The most necessary thing is that the whole be really  comical; then, if possible, there should be two equally good  female parts, one seria, the other mezzo carattere; but one must  be as good as the other. The third woman may be all buffa, also  all the men if necessary.\"    (Vienna, May 7, 1783, to his father, in Salzburg, where the Abbe  Varesco was to write an opera libretto.)    44. \"It would be a pity if I should have composed this music for  nothing, that is to say if no regard is to be shown for things  that are absolutely essential. Neither you, nor Abbe Varesco, nor  I, reflected that it will be a bad thing, that the opera will be  a failure, in fact, if neither of the principal women appears on  the scene until the last minute, but both are kept promenading on  the bastion of the fortress. I credit the audience with patience  enough for one act, but it would never endure the second. It must  not be.\"    (Vienna, December 6, 1783, to his father. The opera in question,  entitled \"L'Oca del Cairo,\" was never finished.)    45. \"Abbe Varesco has written over the cavatina for Lavina:  a cui servira la musica della cavatina antecedente,--that is  the cavatina of Celidora. But that will never do. In Celidora's  cavatina the words are comfortless and hopeless, while in  Lavina's cavatina they are full of comfort and hope. Moreover it  is hackneyed and no longer customary habit to let one singer echo  the song of another. At best it might only be done by a soubrette  and her sweetheart at ultime parti.\"    (Vienna, December 24, 1783, to his father. The Italian phrase is  a direction that the music of a preceding cavatina might be used  for a second cavatina.)    46. \"It is much more natural, since they have all come to an  agreement in the quartetto to carry out their plan of attack that  the men leave the stage to gather their helpers together, and the  women quietly retire to their retreat. All that can be allowed  them is a few lines of recitative.\"    (Vienna, December 24, 1783, to his father. The situation referred  to was in Varesco's opera which never reached completion.)    47. \"At six o'clock I drove with Count Canal to the so-called  'Breitfeldischen Ball' where the pick of the beauties of Prague  are in the habit of congregating. That would have been something  for you, my friend! I fancy seeing you,--not walking, but  limping,--after all the pretty girls and women! I did not dance,  neither did I spoon;--the first because I was too tired, the  second because of my congenital bashfulness. But I saw with great  pleasure how all these people hopped about delightedly to the  music of my 'Figaro' turned into contradances and Allemands.  Here nothing is talked about except 'Figaro,' nothing played,  piped, sung or whistled except 'Figaro;' no opera is attended  except 'Figaro,' always 'Figaro.' Certainly a great honor for  me.\"    (Prague, January 15, 1787, to a friend, whose name is unknown.)    48. \"'Don Giovanni' was not written for the Viennese; rather for  the people of Prague, but most of all for me and my friends.\"    (Reported by Nissen, who also relates that Mozart often said  \"The Bohemians are the ones who understand me.\" When \"Le Nozze  di Figaro\" received an enthusiastic reception in Prague, Mozart  said: \"Because the Bohemians understand me so well I must write  an opera for them.\" The opera was \"Don Giovanni.\")    49. \"I am just home from the opera; it was as crowded as ever.  The duet, 'Mann und Weib,' and the bells in the first act, were  repeated as usual,--also the trio of the boys in the second act.  But what delights me most is the silent applause! It is easy to  see how this opera is ever rising.\"    (Vienna, October 7, 1791, to his wife. The opera was \"Die  Zauberflote.\")        MUSICAL PEDAGOGICS        50. \"Herr Stein is completely daft on the subject of his  daughter. She is eight years old and learns everything by heart.  Something may come of her for she has talent, but not if she goes  on as she is doing now; she will never acquire velocity because  she purposely makes her hand heavy. She will never learn the most  necessary, most difficult and principal thing in music, that is  time, because from childhood she has designedly cultivated the  habit of ignoring the beat.\"    (Augsburg, October 23, 1777, to his father. Nanette Stein  afterward married Andreas Streicher, who was Schiller's companion  in his flight to Franconia. As Frau Streicher she became  Beethoven's faithful friend and frequently took it upon herself  to straighten out his domestic affairs.)    51. \"If she does not get some thoughts and ideas (for now she has  absolutely none), it will all be in vain, for God knows, I can  not give her any. It is not her father's intention to make a  great composer out of her. 'She shall,' he says, 'not write any  operas, or arias, or symphonies, but only great sonatas for her  instrument and mine!' I gave her her fourth lesson today, and so  far as the rules of composition and her exercises are concerned I  am pretty well satisfied with her. She wrote a very good bass to  the first minuet which I set her, and has already begun to write  in three parts. It goes, but she gets bored too quickly. I can  not help her; progress is impossible, she is too young even if  she had talent. Unfortunately she has none; she must be taught  artificially; she has no ideas, there are no results, I have  tried in every sort of way. Among other things it occurred to me  to write"]]]
