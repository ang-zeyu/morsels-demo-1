A green gap of  canon, wild and yellow-walled, yawned before her, opening into the  mountain.    Kells halted on the grassy bank of a shallow brook. \"Get down. We'll  noon here and rest the horses,\" he said to Joan. \"I can't say that  you're anything but game. We've done perhaps twenty-five miles this  morning.\"    The mouth of this canon was a wild, green-flowered, beautiful place.  There were willows and alders and aspens along the brook. The green  bench was like a grassy meadow. Joan caught a glimpse of a brown object,  a deer or bear, stealing away through spruce-trees on the slope. She  dismounted, aware now that her legs ached and it was comfortable  to stretch them. Looking backward across the valley toward the last  foot-hill, she saw the other men, with horses and packs, coming. She had  a habit of close observation, and she thought that either the men with  the packs had now one more horse than she remembered, or else she had  not seen the extra one. Her attention shifted then. She watched Kells  unsaddle the horses. He was wiry, muscular, quick with his hands. The  big, blue-cylindered gun swung in front of him. That gun had a queer  kind of attraction for her. The curved black butt made her think of a  sharp grip of hand upon it. Kells did not hobble the horses. He slapped  his bay on the haunch and drove him down toward the brook. Joan's pony  followed. They drank, cracked the stones, climbed the other bank, and  began to roll in the grass. Then the other men with the packs trotted  up. Joan was glad. She had not thought of it before, but now she felt  she would rather not be alone with Kells. She remarked then that there  was no extra horse in the bunch. It seemed strange, her thinking that,  and she imagined she was not clear-headed.    \"Throw the packs, Bill,\" said Kells.    Another fire was kindled and preparations made toward a noonday meal.  Bill and Halloway appeared loquacious, and inclined to steal glances at  Joan when Kells could not notice. Halloway whistled a Dixie tune. Then  Bill took advantage of the absence of Kells, who went down to the brook,  and he began to leer at Joan and make bold eyes at her. Joan appeared  not to notice him, and thereafter averted; her gaze. The men chuckled.    \"She's the proud hussy! But she ain't foolin' me. I've knowed a heap of  wimmen.\" Whereupon Halloway guffawed, and between them, in lower tones,  they exchanged mysterious remarks. Kells returned with a bucket of  water.    \"What's got into you men?\" he queried.    Both of them looked around, blusteringily innocent.    \"Reckon it's the same that's ailin' you,\" replied Bill. He showed that  among wild, unhampered men how little could inflame and change.    \"Boss, it's the onaccustomed company,\" added Halloway, with a  conciliatory smile. \"Bill sort of warms up. He jest can't help it. An'  seein' what a thunderin' crab he always is, why I'm glad an' welcome.\"    Kells vouchsafed no reply to this and, turning away, continued his  tasks. Joan had a close look at his eyes and again she was startled.  They were not like eyes, but just gray spaces, opaque openings, with  nothing visible behind, yet with something terrible there.    The preparations for the meal went on, somewhat constrainedly on the  part of Bill and Halloway, and presently were ended. Then the men  attended to it with appetites born of the open and of action. Joan sat  apart from them on the bank of the brook, and after she had appeased  her own hunger she rested, leaning back in the shade of an alderbush.  A sailing shadow crossed near her, and, looking up, she saw an eagle  flying above the ramparts of the canon. Then she had a drowsy spell, but  she succumbed to it only to the extent of closing her eyes. Time dragged  on. She would rather have been in the saddle. These men were leisurely,  and Kells was provokingly slow. They had nothing to do with time but  waste it. She tried to combat the desire for hurry, for action; she  could not gain anything by worry. Nevertheless, resignation would  not come to her and her hope began to flag. Something portended  evil--something hung in the balance.    The snort and tramp of horses roused her, and upon sitting up she saw  the men about to pack and saddle again. Kells had spoken to her only  twice so far that day. She was grateful for his silence, but could not  understand it. He seemed to have a preoccupied air that somehow did not  fit the amiableness of his face. He looked gentle, good-natured; he  was soft-spoken; he gave an impression of kindness. But Joan began to  realize that he was not what he seemed. He had something on his mind. It  was not conscience, nor a burden: it might be a projection, a plan,  an absorbing scheme, a something that gained food with thought. Joan  wondered doubtfully if it were the ransom of gold he expected to get.    Presently, when all was about in readiness for a fresh start, she rose  to her feet. Kells's bay was not tractable at the moment. Bill held  out Joan's bridle to her and their hands touched. The contact was an  accident, but it resulted in Bill's grasping back at her hand. She  jerked it away, scarcely comprehending. Then all under the brown of his  face she saw creep a dark, ruddy tide. He reached for her then--put  his hand on her breast. It was an instinctive animal action. He meant  nothing. She divined that he could not help it. She had lived with rough  men long enough to know he had no motive--no thought at all. But at the  profanation of such a touch she shrank back, uttering a cry.    At her elbow she heard a quick step and a sharp-drawn breath or hiss.    \"AW, JACK!\" cried Bill.    Then Kells, in lithe and savage swiftness, came between them. He swung  his gun, hitting Bill full in the face. The man fell, limp and heavy,  and he lay there, with a bloody gash across his brow. Kells stood over  him a moment, slowly lowering the gun. Joan feared he meant to shoot.    \"Oh, don't--don't!\" she cried. \"He--he didn't hurt me.\"    Kells pushed her back. When he touched her she seemed to feel the shock  of an electric current. His face had not changed, but his eyes were  terrible. On the background of gray were strange, leaping red flecks.    \"Take your horse,\" he ordered. \"No. Walk across the brook. There's a  trail. Go up the canon. I'll come presently. Don't run and don't hide.  It'll be the worse for you if you do. Hurry!\"    Joan obeyed. She flashed past the open-jawed Halloway, and, running down  to the brook, stepped across from stone to stone. She found the trail  and hurriedly followed it. She did not look back. It never occurred  to her to hide, to try to get away. She only obeyed, conscious of some  force that dominated her. Once she heard loud voices, then the shrill  neigh of a horse. The trail swung under the left wall of the canon and  ran along the noisy brook. She thought she heard shots and was startled,  but she could not be sure. She stopped to listen. Only the babble of  swift water and the sough of wind in the spruces greeted her ears.  She went on, beginning to collect her thoughts, to conjecture on the  significance of Kells's behavior.    But had that been the spring of his motive? She doubted it--she doubted  all about him, save that subtle essence of violence, of ruthless force  and intensity, of terrible capacity, which hung round him.    A halloo caused her to stop and turn. Two pack-horses were jogging up  the trail. Kells was driving them and leading her pony. Nothing could be  seen of the other men. Kells rapidly overhauled her, and she had to get  out of the trail to let the pack-animals pass. He threw her bridle to  her.    \"Get up,\" he said.    She complied. And then she bravely faced him. \"Where are--the other  men?\"    \"We parted company,\" he replied, curtly.    \"Why?\" she persisted.    \"Well, if you're anxious to know, it was because you were winning  their--regard--too much to suit me.\"    \"Winning their regard!\" Joan exclaimed, blankly.    Here those gray, piercing eyes went through her, then swiftly shifted.  She was quick to divine from that the inference in his words--he  suspected her of flirting with those ruffians, perhaps to escape him  through them. That had only been his suspicion--groundless after his  swift glance at her. Perhaps unconsciousness of his meaning, a simulated  innocence, and ignorance might serve her with this strange man. She  resolved to try it, to use all her woman's intuition and wit and  cunning. Here was an educated man who was a criminal--an outcast. Deep  within him might be memories of a different life. They might be stirred.  Joan decided in that swift instant that, if she could understand him,  learn his real intentions toward her, she could cope with him.    \"Bill and his pard were thinking too much of--of the ransom I'm after,\"  went on Kells, with a short laugh. \"Come on now. Ride close to me.\"    Joan turned into the trail with his laugh ringing in her ears. Did she  only imagine a mockery in it? Was there any reason to believe a word  this man said? She appeared as helpless to see through him as she was in  her predicament.    They had entered a canon, such as was typical of that mountain range,  and the winding trail which ran beneath the yellow walls was one unused  to travel. Joan could not make out any old tracks, except those of deer  and cougar. The crashing of wild animals into the chaparral, and  the scarcely frightened flight of rabbits and grouse attested to the  wildness of the place. They passed an old tumbledown log cabin, once  used, no doubt, by prospectors and hunters. Here the trail ended. Yet  Kells kept on up the canon. And for all Joan could tell the walls grew  only the higher and the timber heavier and the space wilder.    At a turn, when the second pack-horse, that appeared unused to his task,  came fully into Joan's sight, she was struck with his resemblance to  some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#5)"],[1,"have led his army back into Italy,  claimed triumph, and obtained power, without having to seize upon it, as  Sylla, Marius, Cinna, and even Crassus and Pompey, had done.    If Caesar had accepted the government of Gaul with the sole aim of having  an army devoted to his designs, it must be admitted that so experienced  a general would have taken, to commence a civil war, the simplest of the  measures suggested by prudence: instead of separating himself from his  army, he would have kept it with him, or, at least, brought it near to  Italy, and distributed it in such a manner that he could re-assemble it  quickly; he would have preserved, from the immense booty taken in Gaul,  sums sufficient to supply the expenses of the war. Caesar, on the  contrary, as we shall see in the sequel, sends first to Pompey, without  hesitation, two legions which are required from him under the pretext of  the expedition against the Parthians. He undertakes to disband his  troops if Pompey will do the same, and he arrives at Ravenna at the head  of a single legion, leaving the others beyond the Alps, distributed from  the Sambre as far as the Saone.[34] He keeps within the limit of his  government without making any preparation which indicates hostile  intentions,[35] wishing, as Hirtius says, to settle the quarrel by  justice rather than by arms.[36] In fact, he has collected so little  money in the military chest, that his soldiers club together to procure  him the sums necessary for his enterprise, and that all voluntarily  renounce their pay.[37] Caesar offers Pompey an unconditional  reconciliation, and it is only when he sees his advances rejected, and  his adversaries meditating his ruin, that he boldly faces the forces of  the Senate, and passes the Rubicon. It was not, then, the supreme power  which Caesar went into Gaul to seek, but the pure and elevated glory  which arises from a national war, made in the traditional interest of  the country.      [Sidenote: Plan followed in the Relation of the War in Gaul.]    IV. In reproducing in the following chapters the relation of the war in  Gaul, we have borne in mind the words of Cicero. \"Caesar,\" he says, \"has  written memoirs worthy of great praise. Deprived of all oratorical art,  his style, like a handsome body stripped of clothing, presents itself  naked, upright, and graceful. In his desire to furnish materials to  future historians, he has, perhaps, done a thing agreeable to the little  minds who will be tempted to load these natural graces with frivolous  ornaments; but he has for ever deprived men of sense of the desire of  writing, for nothing is more agreeable in history than a correct and  luminous brevity.\"[38] Hirtius, on his part, expresses himself in the  following terms: \"These memoirs enjoy an approval so general, that Caesar  has much more taken from others than given to them the power of writing  the history of the events which they recount. We have still more reasons  than all others for admiring it, for others know only how correct and  accurate this book is; we know the facility and rapidity with which it  was composed.\"[39]    If we would act upon the advice of these writers, we must digress as  little as possible from the \"Commentaries,\" but without restricting  ourselves to a literal translation. We have, then, adopted the narrative  of Caesar, though sometimes changing the order of the matter: we have  abridged passages where there was a prodigality of details, and  developed those which required elucidation. In order to indicate in a  more precise manner the localities which witnessed so many battles, we  have employed the modern names, especially in cases where ancient  geography did not furnish corresponding names.    The investigation of the battle-fields and siege operations has led to  the discovery of visible and certain traces of the Roman entrenchments.  The reader, by comparing the plans of the excavations with the text,  will be convinced of the rigorous accuracy of Caesar in describing the  countries he passed over, and the works he caused to be executed.          CHAPTER II.    STATE OF GAUL IN THE TIME OF CAESAR.    (See Plate I.)      [Sidenote: Geographical Description.]    I. Transalpine Gaul had for its boundaries the ocean, the Pyrenees, the  Mediterranean, the Alps, and the Rhine. This portion of Europe, so well  marked out by nature, comprised what is now France, nearly the whole of  Switzerland, the Rhine Provinces, Belgium, and the south of Holland. It  had the form of an irregular pentagon, and the country of the Carnutes  (the _Orleanais_) was considered to be its centre.[40]    An uninterrupted chain of heights divided Gaul, as it divides modern  France, from north to south, into two parts. This line commences at the  Monts Corbieres, at the foot of the Eastern Pyrenees, is continued by  the Southern Cevennes and by the mountains of the Vivarais, Lyonnais,  and Beaujolais (called the Northern Cevennes), and declines continually  with the mountains of the Charolais and the Cote-d'Or, until it reaches  the plateau of Langres; after quitting this plateau, it leaves to the  east the Monts Faucilles, which unite it to the Vosges, and, inclining  towards the north-west, it follows, across the mountains of the Meuse,  the western crests of the Argonne and the Ardennes, and terminates, in  decreasing undulations, towards Cape Griz-Nez, in the Pas-de-Calais.    This long and tortuous ridge, more or less interrupted, which may be  called the backbone of the country, is the great line of the watershed.  It separates two slopes. On the eastern slope flow the Rhine and the  Rhone, in opposite directions, the first towards the Northern Sea, the  second towards the Mediterranean; on the western slope rise the Seine,  the Loire, and the Garonne, which go to throw themselves into the ocean.  These rivers flow at the bottom of vast basins, the bounds of which, as  is well known, are indicated by the lines of elevations connecting the  sources of all the tributaries of the principal stream.    The basin of the Rhine is separated from that of the Rhone by the Monts  Faucilles, the southern extremity of the Vosges, called _Le trouee de  Belfort_, the Jura, the Jorat (the heights which surround the Lake of  Geneva on the north), and the lofty chain of the Helvetic Alps. In its  upper part, it embraces nearly all Switzerland, of which the Rhine forms  the northern boundary, in its course, from east to west, from the Lake  of Constance to Bale. Near this town the river turns abruptly towards  the north. The basin widens, limited to the east by the mountains which  separate it from the Danube and the Weser; to the west, by the northern  part of the great line of watershed (the mountains of the Meuse, the  Argonne, and the western Ardennes). It is intersected, from Mayence to  Bonn, by chains nearly parallel to the course of the river, which  separate its tributaries. From Bonn to the point where the Rhine divides  into two arms, the basin opens still more; it is flat, and has no  longer a definite boundary. The southern arm bore already, in the time  of Caesar, the name of _Waal_ (Vahalis), and united with the Meuse[41]  below Nimeguen. To the west of the basin of the Rhine, the Scheldt forms  a secondary basin.    The basin of the Rhone, in which is comprised that of the Saone, is  sharply bounded on the north by the southern extremity of the Vosges and  the Monts Faucilles; on the west, by the plateau of Langres, the  Cote-d'Or, and the Cevennes; on the east, by the Jura, the Jorat, and  the Alps. The Rhone crosses the Valais and the Lake of Geneva, follows  an irregular course as far as Lyons, and runs thence from north to south  to the Mediterranean. Among the most important of its secondary basins,  we may reckon those of the Aude, the Herault, and the Var.    The three great basins of the western slope are comprised between the  line of watershed of Gaul and the ocean. They are separated from each  other by two chains branching from this line, and running from the  south-east to the north-west. The basin of the Seine, which includes  that of the Somme, is separated from the basin of the Loire by a line of  heights which branches from the Cote-d'Or under the name of the  mountains of the Morvan, and is continued by the very low hills of Le  Perche to the extremity of Normandy. A series of heights, extending from  north to south, from the hills of Le Perche to Nantes, enclose the basin  of the Loire to the west, and leave outside the secondary basins of  Brittany.    The basin of the Loire is separated from that of the Garonne by a long  chain starting from Mont Lozere, comprising the mountains of Auvergne,  those of the Limousin, the hills of Poitou, and the plateau of Gatine,  and ending in flat country towards the coasts of La Vendee.    The basin of the Garonne, situated to the south of that of the Loire,  extends to the Pyrenees. It comprises the secondary basins of the Adour  and the Charente.    The vast country we have thus described is protected on the north, west,  and south by two seas, and by the Pyrenees. On the east, where it is  exposed to invasions, Nature, not satisfied with the defences she had  given it in the Rhine and the Alps, has further retrenched it behind  three groups of interior mountains--first, the Vosges; second, the Jura;  third, the mountains of Forez, the mountains of Auvergne, and the  Cevennes.    The Vosges run parallel to the Rhine, and are like a rampart in the rear  of that river.    The Jura, separated from the Vosges by _the Gap (trouee) of Belfort_,  rises like a barrier in the interval left between the Rhine and the  Rhone, preventing, as far as Lyons, the waters of this latter river from  uniting with those of the Saone.    The Cevennes and the mountains of Auvergne and Forez form, in the  southern centre of Gaul, a sort of citadel, of which the Rhone might be  considered as the advanced"]]]
