Sherman — Complete (#5)"],[1," all his Indian finery,  which consisted of buckskin leggins, moccasins, and several shirts.  He then began to put on vests, one after another, and one of them  had the marks of a bullet, just above the pocket, with the stain of  blood.  In the pocket was a one-dollar Tallahassee Bank note, and  the rascal had the impudence to ask me to give him silver coin for  that dollar.  He had evidently killed the wearer, and was  disappointed because the pocket contained a paper dollar instead of  one in silver.  In due time he was dressed with turban and  ostrich-feathers, and mounted the horse reserved for him, and thus  we rode back together to Fort Pierce.  Major Childs and all the  officers received him on the porch, and there we had a regular  \"talk.\"  Coacoochee \"was tired of the war.\"  \"His people were  scattered and it would take a 'moon' to collect them for  emigration,\" and he \"wanted rations for that time,\" etc., etc.    All this was agreed to, and a month was allowed for him to get  ready with his whole band (numbering some one hundred and fifty or  one hundred and sixty) to migrate.  The \"talk\" then ceased, and  Coacoochee and his envoys proceeded to get regularly drunk, which  was easily done by the agency of commissary whiskey.  They staid at  Fort Pierce daring the night, and the next day departed.  Several  times during the month there came into the post two or more of  these same Indians, always to beg for something to eat or drink,  and after a full month Coacoochee and about twenty of his warriors  came in with several ponies, but with none of their women or  children.  Major Childs had not from the beginning the least faith  in his sincerity; had made up his mind to seize the whole party and  compel them to emigrate.  He arranged for the usual council, and  instructed Lieutenant Taylor to invite Coacoochee and his uncle  (who was held to be a principal chief) to his room to take some  good brandy, instead of the common commissary whiskey.  At a signal  agreed on I was to go to the quarters of Company A, to dispatch the  first-sergeant and another man to Lieutenant Taylor's room, there  to seize the two chiefs and secure them; and with the company I was  to enter Major Childs's room and secure the remainder of the party.  Meantime Lieutenant Van Vliet was ordered to go to the quarters of  his company, F, and at the same signal to march rapidly to the rear  of the officers' quarters, so as to catch any who might attempt to  escape by the open windows to the rear.    All resulted exactly as prearranged, and in a few minutes the whole  party was in irons.  At first they claimed that we had acted  treacherously, but very soon they admitted that for a month  Coacoochee had been quietly removing his women and children toward  Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades; and that this visit to our post  was to have been their last.  It so happened that almost at the  instant of our seizing these Indians a vessel arrived off the bar  with reenforcements from St. Augustine.  These were brought up to  Fort Pierce, and we marched that night and next day rapidly, some  fifty miles, to Lake Okeechobee, in hopes to capture the balance of  the tribe, especially the families, but they had taken the alarm  and escaped.  Coacoochee and his warriors were sent by Major Childs  in a schooner to New Orleans en route to their reservation, but  General Worth recalled them to Tampa Bay, and by sending out  Coacoochee himself the women and children came in voluntarily, and  then all were shipped to their destination.  This was a heavy loss  to the Seminoles, but there still remained in the Peninsula a few  hundred warriors with their families scattered into very small  parcels, who were concealed in the most inaccessible hammocks and  swamps.  These had no difficulty in finding plenty of food anywhere  and everywhere.  Deer and wild turkey were abundant, and as for  fish there was no end to them.  Indeed, Florida was the Indian's  paradise, was of little value to us, and it was a great pity to  remove the Seminoles at all, for we could have collected there all  the Choctaws, Creeks, Cherokees, and Chickasaws, in addition to the  Seminoles.  They would have thrived in the Peninsula, whereas they  now occupy lands that are very valuable, which are coveted by their  white neighbors on all sides, while the Peninsula, of Florida still  remains with a population less than should make a good State.    During that and preceding years General W. S. Harney had penetrated  and crossed through the Everglades, capturing and hanging Chekika  and his band, and had brought in many prisoners, who were also  shipped West.  We at Fort Pierce made several other excursions to  Jupiter, Lake Worth, Lauderdale, and into the Everglades, picking  up here and there a family, so that it was absurd any longer to  call it a \"war.\"  These excursions, however, possessed to us a  peculiar charm, for the fragrance of the air, the abundance of game  and fish, and just enough of adventure, gave to life a relish.  I  had just returned to Lauderdale from one of these scouts with  Lieutenants Rankin, Ord, George H. Thomas, Field, Van Vliet, and  others, when I received notice of my promotion to be first  lieutenant of Company G, which occurred November 30, 1841, and I  was ordered to return to Fort Pierce, turn over the public property  for which I was accountable to Lieutenant H. S. Burton, and then to  join my new company at St. Augustine.    I reached St. Augustine before Christmas, and was assigned to  command a detachment of twenty men stationed at Picolata, on the  St. John's River, eighteen miles distant.  At St. Augustine were  still the headquarters of the regiment, Colonel William Gates, with  Company E, Lieutenant Bragg, and Company G, Lieutenant H. B. Judd.  The only buildings at Picolata were the one occupied by my  detachment, which had been built for a hospital, and the dwelling  of a family named Williams, with whom I boarded.  On the other  hand, St. Augustine had many pleasant families, among whom was  prominent that of United States Judge Bronson.  I was half my time  in St. Augustine or on the road, and remember the old place with  pleasure.  In February we received orders transferring the whole  regiment to the Gulf posts, and our company, G, was ordered to  escort Colonel Gates and his family across to the Suwanee River, en  route for Pensacola.  The company, with the colonel and his family,  reached Picolata (where my detachment joined), and we embarked in a  steamboat for Pilatka.  Here Lieutenant Judd discovered that he had  forgotten something and had to return to St. Augustine, so  that I commanded the company on the march, having with me  Second-Lieutenant George B. Ayres.  Our first march was to Fort  Russell, then Micanopy, Wacahoota, and Wacasassee, all which posts  were garrisoned by the Second or Seventh Infantry.  At Wacasassee we  met General Worth and his staff, en route for Pilatka.  Lieutenant  Judd overtook us about the Suwanee, where we embarked on a small  boat for Cedar Keys, and there took a larger one for Pensacola,  where the colonel and his family landed, and our company proceeded  on in the same vessel to our post--Fort Morgan, Mobile Point.    This fort had not been occupied by troops for many years, was very  dirty, and we found little or no stores there.  Major Ogden, of the  engineers, occupied a house outside the fort.  I was quartermaster  and commissary, and, taking advantage of one of the engineer  schooners engaged in bringing materials for the fort, I went up to  Mobile city, and, through the agency of Messrs.  Deshon, Taylor,  and Myers, merchants, procured all essentials for the troops, and  returned to the post.  In the course of a week or ten days arrived  another company, H, commanded by Lieutenant James Ketchum, with  Lieutenants Rankin and Sewall L. Fish, and an assistant surgeon  (Wells.)  Ketchum became the commanding officer, and Lieutenant  Rankin quartermaster.  We proceeded to put the post in as good  order as possible; had regular guard-mounting and parades, but  little drill.  We found magnificent fishing with the seine on the  outer beach, and sometimes in a single haul we would take ten or  fifteen barrels of the best kind of fish, embracing pompinos,  red-fish, snappers, etc.    We remained there till June, when the regiment was ordered to  exchange from the Gulf posts to those on the Atlantic, extending  from Savannah to North Carolina.  The brig Wetumpka was chartered,  and our company (G) embarked and sailed to Pensacola, where we took  on board another company (D) (Burke's), commanded by Lieutenant H.  S. Burton, with Colonel Gates, the regimental headquarters, and  some families.  From Pensacola we sailed for Charleston, South  Carolina.  The weather was hot, the winds light, and we made a long  passage but at last reached Charleston Harbor, disembarked, and  took post in Fort Moultrie.    Soon after two other companies arrived, Bragg's (B) and Keyes's  (K).  The two former companies were already quartered inside of  Fort Moultrie, and these latter were placed in gun-sheds, outside,  which were altered into barracks.  We remained at Fort Moultrie  nearly five years, until the Mexican War scattered us forever.  Our  life there was of strict garrison duty, with plenty of leisure for  hunting and social entertainments.  We soon formed many and most  pleasant acquaintances in the city of Charleston; and it so  happened that many of the families resided at Sullivan's Island in  the summer season, where we could reciprocate the hospitalities  extended to us in the winter.    During the summer of 1843, having been continuously on duty for  three years, I applied for and received a leave of absence for  three months, which I spent mostly in Ohio.  In November I started  to return to my post at Charleston by way of New Orleans; took the  stage to Chillicothe, Ohio, November 16th, having Henry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#5)"],[1,"that would leave an aperture  sufficiently large to admit the class of birds desired.  Along this  trench seeds and other food were scattered, which the birds soon  discovered, and of course began to eat, unsuspectingly following the  tempting bait through the gallery till they emerged from its farther  end in the centre of the trap, where they contentedly fed till the  food was all gone.  Then the fact of imprisonment first presented  itself, and they vainly endeavored to escape through the interstices  of the cage, never once guided by their instinct to return to liberty  through the route by which they had entered.    Among the different kinds of birds captured in this way,  mocking-birds, blue-birds, robins, meadow larks, quail, and plover  were the most numerous.  They seemed to have more voracious appetites  than other varieties, or else they were more unwary, and consequently  more easily caught.  A change of station, however, put an end to my  ornithological plans, and activities of other kinds prevented me from  resuming them in after life.    There were quite a number of young officers at the post during the  winter, and as our relations with the Mexican commandant at Piedras  Negras were most amicable, we were often invited to dances at his  house.  He and his hospitable wife and daughter drummed up the female  portion of the elite of Piedras Negras and provided the house, which  was the official as well as the personal residence of the commandant,  while we--the young officers--furnished the music and such  sweetmeats, candies, &c., for the baille as the country would afford.    We generally danced in a long hall on a hard dirt floor.  The girls  sat on one side of the hall, chaperoned by their mothers or some old  duennas, and the men on the other.  When the music struck up each man  asked the lady whom his eyes had already selected to dance with him,  and it was not etiquette for her to refuse--no engagements being  allowed before the music began.  When the dance, which was generally  a long waltz, was over, he seated his partner, and then went to a  little counter at the end of the room and bought his dulcinea a plate  of the candies and sweetmeats provided.  Sometimes she accepted them,  but most generally pointed to her duenna or chaperon behind, who held  up her apron and caught the refreshments as they were slid into it  from the plate.  The greatest decorum was maintained at these dances,  primitively as they were conducted; and in a region so completely cut  off from the world, their influence was undoubtedly beneficial to a  considerable degree in softening the rough edges in a half-breed  population.    The inhabitants of this frontier of Mexico were strongly marked with  Indian characteristics, particularly with those of the Comanche type,  and as the wild Indian blood predominated, few of the physical traits  of the Spaniard remained among them, and outlawry was common.  The  Spanish conquerors had left on the northern border only their  graceful manners and their humility before the cross.  The sign of  Christianity was prominently placed at all important points on roads  or trails, and especially where any one had been killed; and as the  Comanche Indians, strong and warlike, had devastated northeastern  Mexico in past years, all along the border, on both sides of the Rio  Grande, the murderous effects of their raids were evidenced by  numberless crosses.  For more than a century forays had been made on  the settlements and towns by these bloodthirsty savages, and, the  Mexican Government being too weak to afford protection, property was  destroyed, the women and children carried off or ravished, and the  men compelled to look on in an agony of helplessness till relieved by  death.  During all this time, however, the forms and ceremonials of  religion, and the polite manners received from the Spaniards, were  retained, and reverence for the emblems of Christianity was always  uppermost in the mind of even the most ignorant.          CHAPTER III.    ORDERED TO FORT READING, CAL.--A DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING--A RESCUED  SOLDIER--DISCOVERING INDIANS--PRIMITIVE FISHING--A DESERTED  VILLAGE--CAMPING OPPOSITE FORT VANCOUVER.    In November, 1854, I received my promotion to a second lieutenancy in  the Fourth Infantry, which was stationed in California and Oregon. In  order to join my company at Fort Reading, California, I had to go to  New York as a starting point, and on arrival there, was placed on  duty, in May, 1855, in command of a detachment of recruits at  Bedloe's Island, intended for assignment to the regiments on the  Pacific coast.  I think there were on the island (now occupied by the  statue of Liberty Enlightening the World) about three hundred  recruits.  For a time I was the only officer with them, but shortly  before we started for California, Lieutenant Francis H. Bates, of the  Fourth Infantry, was placed in command. We embarked for the Pacific  coast in July, 1855, and made the journey without incident via the  Isthmus of Panama, in due time landing our men at Benecia Barracks,  above San Francisco.    From this point I proceeded to join my company at Fort Reading, and  on reaching that post, found orders directing me to relieve  Lieutenant John B. Hood--afterward well known as a distinguished  general in the Confederate service.  Lieutenant Hood was in command  of the personal mounted escort of Lieutenant R. S. Williamson, who  was charged with the duty of making such explorations and surveys as  would determine the practicability of connecting, by railroad, the  Sacramento Valley in California with the Columbia River in Oregon  Territory, either through the Willamette Valley, or (if this route  should prove to be impracticable) by the valley of the Des Chutes  River near the foot-slopes of the Cascade chain.  The survey was  being made in accordance with an act of Congress, which provided both  for ascertaining the must practicable and economical route for a  railroad between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean, and for  military and geographical surveys west of the Mississippi River.    Fort Reading was the starting-point for this exploring expedition,  and there I arrived some four or five days after the party under  Lieutenant Williamson had begun its march.  His personal escort  numbered about sixty mounted men, made up of detachments from  companies of the First Dragoons, under command of Lieutenant Hood,  together with about one hundred men belonging to the Fourth Infantry  and Third Artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Horatio Gates Gibson,  the present colonel of the Third United States Artillery.  Lieutenant  George Crook--now major-general--was the quartermaster and commissary  of subsistence of the expedition.    The commanding officer at Fort Reading seemed reluctant to let me go  on to relieve Lieutenant Hood, as the country to be passed over was  infested by the Pit River Indians, known to be hostile to white  people and especially to small parties.  I was very anxious to  proceed, however, and willing to take the chances; so, consent being  finally obtained, I started with a corporal and two mounted men,  through a wild and uninhabited region, to overtake if possible  Lieutenant Williamson.  Being on horseback, and unencumbered by  luggage of any kind except blankets and a little hard bread, coffee  and smoking-tobacco, which were all carried on our riding animals, we  were sanguine of succeeding, for we traversed in one day fully the  distance made in three by Lieutenant Williamson's party on foot.    The first day we reached the base of Lassan's Butte, where I  determined to spend the night near an isolated cabin, or dugout, that  had been recently constructed by a hardy pioneer.  The wind was  blowing a disagreeable gale, which had begun early in the day.  This  made it desirable to locate our camp under the best cover we could  find, and I spent some little time in looking about for a  satisfactory place, but nothing better offered than a large fallen  tree, which lay in such a direction that by encamping on its lee side  we would be protected from the fury of the storm.  This spot was  therefore fixed upon, and preparation made for spending the night as  comfortably as the circumstances would permit.    After we had unsaddled I visited the cabin to inquire in regard to  the country ahead, and there found at first only a soldier of  Williamson's party; later the proprietor of the ranch appeared.  The  soldier had been left behind by the surveying party on account of  illness, with instructions to make his way back to Fort Reading as  best he could when he recovered.  His condition having greatly  improved, however, since he had been left, he now begged me in  beseeching terms to take him along with my party, which I finally  consented to do, provided that if he became unable to keep up with  me, and I should be obliged to abandon him, the responsibility would  be his, not mine.  This increased my number to five, and was quite a  reinforcement should we run across any hostile Indians; but it was  also certain to prove an embarrassment should the man again fall ill.    During the night, notwithstanding the continuance of the storm, I had  a very sound and refreshing sleep behind the protecting log where we  made our camp, and at daylight next morning we resumed our journey,  fortified by a breakfast of coffee and hard bread.  I skirted around  the base of Lassan's Butte, thence down Hat Creek, all the time  following the trail made by Lieutenant Williamson's party.  About  noon the soldier I had picked up at my first camp gave out, and could  go no farther.  As stipulated when I consented to take him along, I  had the right to abandon him, but when it came to the test I could  not make up my mind to do it.  Finding a good place not far off the  trail, one of my men volunteered to remain with him until he died;  and we left them there, with a "]]]
