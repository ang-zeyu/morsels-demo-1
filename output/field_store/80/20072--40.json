Then the bait will lay on the foundation of trap within 5  or 6 inches of front of the trap. Don't put bait away back under  stone. You loose all the force when it falls.    In building foundations for traps the utmost caution should be  exercised in getting them good and solid. (See how well you can do it  instead of how quick.) Begin in the fall before the trapping season  is on, locate and build your trap, and be sure the top stone is  plenty heavy, raise it up and let it fall several times. If it comes  together with the bang of a wolf trap and will pinch a hair, so much  the better.    To illustrate: While squirrel shooting one morning in the fall of  1905, I was standing on a ledge where I used to trap for coons, and I  happened to remember of a trap underneath me. I just thought I would  see if it was there. I went down and kicked away the drifted leaves  and found it intact and ready for business. When I lifted it up the  foundation was as solid as the day I put it there, and that was in  the fall of 1890, and I want to say right here that it took all the  strength I had to set it.      [Illustration: KILLED WITHOUT SCENTING ]    Trappers, if you will try one or more of the above described  deadfalls for those skunk, I think you can tie their pelts about your  neck for protection cold mornings, and none will be the wiser as far  as smell goes, provided, however, you put some obstruction to the  right and left of the trap so it will compel his skunkship to enter  direct in front, and then carefully adjust the length of bait stick  so stone will crush him about the heart. I have taken quite a lot of  skunk and very few ever scented where the head and heart were under  stone, writes an Ohio trapper.    I always had a preference for above described traps for many reasons,  yet if you live where there is no stone, you are not in it.      * * *    Deadfalls come in handy sometimes and with no cost whatever--unless  the cost is building them. Will send two illustrations of the stone  deadfalls writes a successful deadfall trapper. Will say that there  is a right and a wrong way to set the deadfall. If you want to make  sure of your catch never set your deadfall flat with short triggers  shaped like figure 4, but make long triggers instead and have the  weight or choker sit almost upright and draw the top trigger close to  the one that it rests on at the bottom. In this way you have a trap  that will be very easy to touch off.      [Illustration: RIGHT AND WRONG WAY.]    The way that some set their deadfalls the animal can remove bait  without being caught, simply because they draw the bait out from  under the trap and stand far enough away to be out of danger of being  caught. I can take a two hundred pound weight and set a deadfall that  will catch a small field mouse but it would not do to have them knock  that easy for you will get game that is too small to handle.        CHAPTER VI.    THE BEAR PEN.    I will give a description of a bear pen, writes a Canadian trapper.  The bottom of the floor is made first of two logs about (1-1) nine  feet long and nine or ten inches thick. They are placed side by side  as shown in cut and two other logs (2-2) nine feet long and eighteen  inches in thickness are placed one on each side of the bottom logs.  Then cut two short logs about twelve or fourteen inches thick and  long enough to reach across the pen and extend about six inches over  each side. Notch these down, as shown in cut (3-3) so that the top of  the logs are about three or four inches higher than the sides.    Cut notches in the top of these logs so that when logs 4-4 will lay  solid on top of the other side logs. If they don't lie solid enough  bore holes in the ends of the short logs and drive wooden pins in the  holes. The top of the short logs and the inside of the long logs  should be flattened and a short block (5) fitted loosely in one end,  and the other end should be closed by a block driven down in notches  cut in the sides of 4-4, as shown in small cut. The top of the block  (6) should be about five inches lower than the top of the side logs.  Notches are next cut in the side logs, directly over this block, so  that when the roller (7) is in place, it will fit down snugly on this  block. The roller is about five inches thick and should turn easily  in the notches.      [Illustration: BEAR PEN TRAP.]    The next step is to make the lid. It should be made of two logs of  such a size that they will entirely close the top of the trap. They  are notches down and pinned onto the roller and block 5. These logs  should project over rear end of pen about four or five feet. Before  pinning these logs in places, a hole should be made for the bait  stick, half of it being cut in each log. Pins should be driven in the  side logs, over the roller, so that the bear cannot raise the lid.  Two crotches are then cut and set up at the sides of the trap and  spiked solid to the sides. A short pole is then placed in the  crotches and a long pole, running lengthwise of the trap, is fastened  to the lid at one end with wire and the other ends fits into a notch  in the bait stick when the trap is set. The bait stick has a spike  driven thru it on the inside of the trap to keep it from pulling  thru.    To set the trap, pile stones on the end of the lid until it will tip  easily, then put a pole thru under lid and go inside and fasten the  bait on the bait stick. Then pull the long pole down and hook it into  the notch in the bait stick. Remove the stones from lid and take the  pole from under it and the trap is set and ready for the first bear  that comes along. If the lid does not seem heavy enough, pile stone  on it. A trap of this kind may be made by two men in half a day and  will be good for a number of years.      * * *    The log trap is one of the very best methods of taking the bear, it  beats the deadfall all to nothing, says an old and experienced Ohio  bear trapper. It is a sure shot every time; I have never known it to  fail except where the pen had stood for a number of years and become  rotten. In a case of that kind the bear would have no difficulty in  gnawing his way out. This trap or pen, as I shall call it, has been  time tried and bear tested. My father used to make these traps and  many is the time when a boy I have ridden on horseback upon a narrow  path, cut for the purpose of letting a horse pass along and on  nearing the pen heard the growling and tearing around of the bear in  the pen and the hair on my head would almost crowd my hat off.    Go about building it this way: First select the spot where you have  reason to believe that bear inhabit; now having made your selection,  get a level place and on this spot lay a course of logs with the top  flattened off; this may be eight by three feet. This being done,  commence to lay up the house of logs six to eight inches in diameter.  Three sides of each log should be flattened; these will be the top,  bottom and the inside. It is necessary this be done, for they must  fit closely together in order that the bear cannot get a starting  place to gnaw. This is why I suggest that the inside of the log be  flattened. It is a well-known fact that you can put any gnawing  animal into a square box and he cannot gnaw out for he cannot get the  starting point.    Lay a short log first, then a long one, notching each corner as you  go so the logs will fit closely together. Now for the front corners;  drive a flattened stake into the ground, letting the flattened side  come against the logs. Now as you proceed to lay on a course of logs  pin thru the stake into each log. Now go on up until you get a height  of about four feet, then lay on, for the top, a course of short logs  commencing at the back end.    Between the second and third logs cut out a little notch and flatten  the under side of this log around the notch; this is to receive the  trigger, which is made of a small pole about three inches thick. Put  this into the hole and let it come down within ten inches of the  floor. Then cut a notch in the side facing the front of the pen and  so it will fit up against the under side of the leg with the notch  in; now you may make a notch in the trigger about six inches above  the top of the pen and on the same side of the trigger that the first  notch was made. Now the trigger is ready except adjusting the bait.      [Illustration: BEAR ENTERING PEN.]    Next lay a binder on top of the pen and upon either end of the short  course of logs; pin the binders at either end so the bear cannot  raise the top off the pen. You may also lay on three or four logs to  weight it down and make it doubly sure. You may pin the first short  top log in front to the side logs to keep the front of the pen from  spreading. Now we have the body of the pen complete.    The door is the next thing in order. The first or bottom log ought to  be twelve feet long, but it is not necessary for the balance of them  to be that length; flatten the top and bottom of each log so they  will lie tight together, also flatten off the inside of the door so  it will work smoothly against the end of the pen. Lay the logs of the  door onto the first or long log, putting a pin in each end of the  logs as you lay them on. Go on this way until you have enough to  reach the height of the pen and fully cover the opening.    Another way of fastening the door together is to get the logs all  ready, then lay them upon the ground and pin two pieces across the  door. Either way will do. Now the door being in readiness, put it in  its place and drive two stakes in the ground to keep the animal from  shoving the door away. If these do not appear to be solid enough to  support the door against an onslaught, you may cut a notch in the  outside of the stake near the top; get a pole eight feet in length,  sharpen "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#5)"],[1,"these organs. For this reason I  have inserted drawings of a fore and of a hind wing of a butterfly,  together with the names of the various parts of the wings, and also the  names of the principal rays or _nervures_. Yet I would not advise any  young entomologist to attempt to commit to memory all the names given.  Rather use the diagram for reference when occasion requires, more  particularly when you have an insect in your possession that you desire  to study. In ordinary descriptions of butterflies and moths the names of  the _nervures_ are not so generally used as those of the _parts_ of the  wing. Consequently it is exceedingly useful to know what is meant by the  terms _base_, _costal margin_, _apex_, _hind margin_, _anal angle_,  _inner margin_, _discoidal cell_ &c. as applied to the wing.    The two pairs of wings are attached to the second and third segments of  the thorax; but of the _three_ pairs of legs, which we have next to  consider, one pair arises from each of the three segments. The  arrangement of these limbs is well shown in the sketch on page 3, as are  also the names of the different parts of the limb, the latter being  given for reference by the reader when the need arises.    All insects, in their perfect state, we are told, have three pairs of  legs; but if you examine the under surface of certain butterflies, such  as the Marbled White, or any of the Vanessas, Browns, or Heaths, it is  quite likely that you will raise objection to such a statement; for in  these you may possibly see only four legs. But this is the result of a  too cursory observation. Look a little more closely at your specimen,  and you will see a pair of smaller legs folded up under the fore part of  the thorax. By means of a blunt needle you can straighten out these  limbs, and then the difference in length to be observed between them and  the other four is very striking indeed. They are also thinner than the  middle and hind legs; and, unlike these, are not provided with claws.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--DIAGRAM OF THE WINGS OF A BUTTERFLY.    I. _Fore wing._--1-5, subcostal nervules; 6, 7, discoidal nervules;  8-10, median nervules; 11, submedian nervure; 12, internal nervure;  13-15, disco-cellular nervules; 16, interno-median nervule; 17, median  nervure; 18, subcostal nervure; _a_, costal nervure; _b_, costa or  anterior margin; _c_, apex or anterior angle; _d_, posterior or hind  margin; _e_, posterior or anal angle; _f_, interior or inner margin;  _g_, base; _h_, discoidal cell.

On one occasion,  however, while watching a Peacock Butterfly apparently engaged in  cleaning its divided proboscis, I observed that this organ was  frequently passed under the thorax, and that the front pair of legs were  pressed against it on each side, while it was being drawn outward  between them. It is probable, therefore, that these limbs constitute a  pair of brushes by means of which the fine grooves of the divided trunk  are cleared of any solid or sticky matter that may lodge therein. It is  certain that moths, and those butterflies that possess six _equal_ legs,  use the front pair for this same purpose. The former, also, employ them  for brushing their antennae, which seem to be, by the way, particularly  sensitive to different kinds of irritation.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE UNDEVELOPED FORE LEG OF A BUTTERFLY.]    It is a well-known fact that tobacco smoke has a powerful influence on  certain small insects; and even though it can hardly be regarded as a  perfect all-round insecticide, it is certainly more or less  objectionable to the larger and hardier species. A short time since,  while watching a number of newly emerged moths of the _Sphinx_ group,  and at the same time enjoying the solace afforded by the luxurious weed,  a puff of the smoke was accidentally allowed to play into the box in  which my pets were for the time imprisoned. Immediately they rubbed  their front legs vigorously over the antennae, as if to remove the  obnoxious irritant that had thus intruded on their presence. Similar  observations have led many naturalists to suppose that the antennae are  the seat of various senses, such as those of touch, hearing, and smell.  Seeing that insects do not, as far as we know, possess special organs  for all the five senses which we enjoy (and it is interesting to note  here that some insects certainly experience other sensations which are  quite beyond our ken), we can quite understand the common tendency to  locate the seats of certain of the senses in such easily affected parts  as the antennae. But little, I believe, has been definitely proved save  that the antennae are sensitive to touch and to irritants generally.    While speaking of the senses of insects, I cannot refrain from  mentioning a most remarkable example of a peculiar sensitiveness that  has been observed in certain moths of the family _Bombyces_ (page  217)--notably the Oak Eggar, the Emperor, and the Kentish Glory. Take a  newly emerged female of either of these species, shut her up in a small  box, conceal the box in your pocket, and then walk about in some  country spot known to you as being one of the haunts of that species of  moth. Then, if any of the males of the same species happen to be in the  neighbourhood, they will settle or hover about close to the female  which, although still concealed and quite out of their reach, has  attracted them to the spot.    What a marvellously acute sense this must be, that thus enables the  insects to scent out, as it were, their mates at considerable distances,  even when doubly surrounded by a wooden box and the material of a coat  pocket! You would naturally expect that entomologists have turned this  wonderful power to account. Many a box has been filled with the  beautiful Kentish Glories of the male kind, who had been led into the  snare by the attractions of a virgin Glory that they were never to  behold. Many an Emperor has also been decoyed from his throne to the  place of his execution, beguiled by the imaginary charms of an Empress  on whom he was never to cast one passing glance. And these and other  similar captures have been made in places where, without the employment  of the innocent enchantress, perhaps not a single male could have been  found, even after the most diligent search.    Speaking of this surprising sense, I am again tempted to revert to the  antennae; for it is a remarkable fact that the males of those species of  moths which exhibit the power of thus searching out their mates, are  just those that are also remarkable for their very broad and deeply  pectinated antennae--a fact that has led to the supposition that the  power in question is located in the antennae, and is also proportional to  the amount of surface displayed by these organs.    Up to the present time we have been considering the butterfly and moth  in their perfect forms, but everybody knows that the former is not  _always_ a butterfly, nor is the latter always a moth; but that they  both pass through certain preparatory stages before they attain their  final winged state.    We shall now notice briefly what these earlier stages are, leaving the  detailed descriptions of each for the following chapters.    The life of the perfect butterfly or moth is of very short duration,  often only a few days, nearly the whole of its existence having been  spent in preparing itself for the brief term to be enjoyed                          ... in fields of light,    And where the flowers of Paradise unfold.    It may be interesting to consider of what use the metamorphoses of  insects are, and to what extent these metamorphoses render them fit for  the work they have to do.    It is certain that the chief work of insects, taken as a whole, is to  remove from the earth the excess of animal and vegetable matter. If they  are to do this work effectually, it is clear that they must be very  voracious feeders, and also be capable of multiplying their species  prodigiously. Now each of these powers requires the special development  of a certain set of organs, and an abnormal development of one set must  necessarily be produced at the expense of the other. Hence we find  insects existing in two distinct stages, with or without an intermediate  quiescent state, during the first of which the digestive apparatus is  enormously developed, while the reproductive organs occupy but very  little space; then, during the other stage, the digestive apparatus is  of the simplest possible description, and the organs of reproduction are  in a perfect state of development.    Allowing, then, that the chief work of the insect is the removal of  surplus organic matter, we can see that a large share of its life should  be spent in the larval or grub stage, and that the perfect state _need_  not occupy any more time than is necessary for the fertilisation of the  eggs that almost completely fill the body of the female at the time of  her emergence from the chrysalis shell.    Many insects undergo their metamorphoses by slow degrees, but the  _Lepidoptera_, after existing for some considerable period without any  important visible change in structure, pass by a rapid transition into  the next state. Thus, a caterpillar, that has not altered in general  form for several weeks, changes into a chrysalis within the course of a  few days; and again,"]]]
