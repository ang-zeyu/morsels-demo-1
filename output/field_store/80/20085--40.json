But in each of the other cities, now comprehended in the  state, there flourished painters during the same period, guided by  maxims differing both from those of Venice and of Murano. The School of  Bergamo had even then made distinguished progress under the direction of  the two Nova, who died at the commencement of the century; and mention  is made of a Commenduno, one of their pupils, besides some other  contemporaries, whose works, however, cannot, with any degree of  certainty, be pointed out. The same may be said of those in the adjacent  city of Brescia, which could then, also, boast of possessing some  excellent artists. Of these, there is nothing more than the name now  remaining, yet Brandolin Testorino and Ottaviano Brandino are names  placed in competition with that of Gentile di Fabriano, and, perhaps,  they are preferred to him. The former was supposed to have been engaged  along with Altichiero, in ornamenting the great hall in Padua, entitled  _Sala de' Giganti_.[19]    Subsequent to both of these appeared Vincenzio Foppa, of Brescia,  founder of an ancient school at Milan, of which I shall treat more at  length in the following book. Vasari makes mention of a Vincenzio da  Brescia, or Vincenzio Verchio, who is the same Vincenzo Civerchio di  Crema, commended by Ridolfo, and so much admired by the French in the  capture of Crema, that they fixed upon one of his pictures, then  ornamenting the public palace, to be presented to their king, and to  this artist we shall also again allude.    About the commencement of the fifteenth century there flourished, in  Verona, an artist of the name of Stefano,[20] declared, as it appears to  me, by Vasari, sometimes a native of Verona, sometimes of Zevio, a  territory adjacent to the former. The same author makes honourable  mention of him in several places, exalting him above the best disciples  of Angiolo Gaddi, to whose style, judging from what I have myself  observed at San Fermo and elsewhere, he added a certain dignity and  beauty of form, while such was his excellence in frescos, as to be  extolled by Donatello beyond any of the artists who were then known for  similar compositions in those parts.[21]    The Commendatore del Pozzo brings his labours down as far as the year  1463, an incredible assertion, as applied to a scholar of Gaddi. To this  period might better be referred Vincenzio di Stefano, apparently one of  his sons, of whom nothing survives but his name, and the tradition of  having conferred the first lessons of the art upon Liberale.    Highly distinguished, on the other hand, both by the consent of the  Veronese and of foreigners, is the name of Vittor Pisanello; although  there exists great confusion of dates in his history. Vasari makes him a  disciple of Castagno, who died about the year 1480; yet del Pozzo  informs us that he has in his house a holy figure, with the annexed  signature of Vittore, and dated 1406, most probably before the birth of  Castagno. Again we are told by Oretti that he was in possession of one  of his medals, representing the Sultan Mahomet, struck in the year 1481,  a supposition which, admitting the picture of Pozzo, we are unable to  reconcile to facts, so that the medal was, perhaps, taken from some  painting of Pisanello, coloured at a former time. To whatever master  Vittore may have been indebted, certain it is that several of his too  partial admirers have placed him above Masaccio, in regard to the  services rendered by him towards the progress of the art, though  impartial judges will not refuse to give him a station near him. The  whole of his labours, both in Venice and in Rome, have now perished. At  Verona, also, little remains; even that noble piece of San Eustachio, so  highly extolled by Vasari himself, having been destroyed; and his  _Nunziata_, at San Fermo, being greatly defaced by time, in which,  however, is still visible a country house, thrown into such admirable  perspective, as to delight the beholder. There remain several little  altarpieces, containing histories of San Bernardino, finished in the  style of the miniaturists, in the sacristy of San Francesco; but they  are crude in their colouring, and the figures more than usually long and  dry. The _Guide_ of the city announces them as the productions of  Pisanello; but there is no authority for this, and upon the strength of  a date of 1473, which is seen upon one of them, I do not scruple to  pronounce them by another hand. He is commended by Facio, (p. 47) for  his almost poetical style of expression; and there is a specimen of an  effort at caricature, with which Vittore embellished his historic  painting of Frederick Barbarossa, in the ducal palace at Venice. He is,  moreover, praised by the same author for his skill in drawing horses and  other animals, in which he surpassed every other artist. His name is not  unknown to the antiquaries; many medals struck by him, of different  princes, being found in museums, which acquired for him, in an equal  degree with his pictures, the esteem and applauses of Guarino, of  Vespasiano Strozza, of Biondo, and of several other distinguished  scholars.    In the adjacent city of Vicenza, resided a Jacopo Tintorello, strongly  resembling Vittore in his style of colouring, however inferior to him in  the perfection of his design, as far as we are enabled to judge from a  picture of the Saviour, with a crown of thorns, exhibited at Santa  Corona; a piece which reflects credit upon that school. It is yet more  highly honoured by an _Epiphany_, painted in San Bartolommeo, by  Marcello Figolino, an artist commemorated by Ridolfi, under the name of  Giovanni Batista, and who flourished, according to his account, at the  period of the two Montagna. He must, however, at that time, have been  far advanced in years, if it be true that the era of his birth preceded  that of Gian Bellini.[22] His manner is undoubtedly original; so much  so, that I find nothing resembling it, either in Venice or elsewhere; it  embraces great diversity of countenance, and of costume, skilful  gradation of light and shade, with landscape and perspective; and is  remarkable for ornament, and the finish and smoothness of every part. It  was fully entitled to render its author the father of a new epoch in the  history of art; if, indeed, we are to believe him, which does not  sufficiently appear, to be as ancient as has been affirmed.    Up to this period I have described the merits of the artists of the city  and of the state, who appeared in the early part of the century; but I  have not yet recorded its greatest master; I mean Squarcione, of Padua,  who from his ability in bringing up pupils, was pronounced by his  followers the first master of painters, and continued to educate them  until they amounted to 137. Ambitious of seeing more of the world, he  not only traversed the whole of Italy, but passing into Greece, he took  designs of the best specimens, both in painting and sculpture, of every  thing he met with, besides purchasing several. On returning to his  native place, he began to form a studio, which proved the richest of any  known at that period, not merely in designs, but in statues, torsos,  bassi relievi, and funereal urns. Thus devoting himself to the  instruction of students, with such copies, aided by his precepts, rather  than by his own example, he continued to live in comparative affluence,  and divided many of the commissions which he received among his  different pupils. In the church of the Misericordia is preserved a book  of anthems, illustrated with very beautiful miniatures, commonly  ascribed to Mantegna, the ornament of that school: but so great is the  variety of the different styles, that the most competent judges conclude  it to be one of the works committed to Squarcione, and by him  distributed among his disciples. Of these we are not yet prepared to  treat, the chief part of whom are known to have flourished subsequent to  the introduction of painting in oils, while little can be said of the  productions of Squarcione himself, though much in respect to his labours  as a master. And, indeed, he may be considered the stock, as it were,  whose branches we trace, through Mantegna, in the grand school of  Lombardy; through Marco Zoppo in the Bolognese; while it extended some  degree of influence over that of Venice itself. For Jacopo Bellini,  having come to exercise his talents in Padua, it would appear that he  took Squarcione for his model, as before stated.    There is nothing remaining from the hand of Squarcione, in Padua, that  can be relied upon with certainty, except an altarpiece, formerly to be  seen at the Carmelitani, but now in possession of the accomplished Conte  Cav. de' Lazara. It is drawn in different compartments; the chief place  is occupied by the figure of San Girolamo. Around him appear other  saints; but the work is in parts re-touched, though there is sufficient  of what is original to establish the character of the painter. Rich in  colouring, in expression, and above all in perspective, it may be  declared one of the best specimens of the art produced in those parts.  The painting of the altarpiece, here alluded to, was assigned him by the  noble family of the Lazara, of which the contract is still preserved by  them, dated 1449, the salary being paid in 1452, the period at which it  was completed. The artist subscribes himself _Francesco Squarcione_,  whence we are enabled to correct the mistake of Vasari, who, invariably  unfortunate in his nomenclature of the Venetians, announces his name as  Jacopo, an error repeated also in the dictionaries of artists. Besides  this specimen, there still exist, in a cloister of San Francesco Grande,  some histories of that saint in _terra verde_, which are to be referred  to the early part of his life, there being good authority for believing  them to be by the same hand, though with the assistance of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34672"],[0,"Fish Stories (#5)"],[1,"the fur on the bear's paw for a  particularly desirable variety of moss, and so were caught.    At this point in my investigations, I was reminded that a few years  ago there was conducted, in the columns of several fishing and  hunting magazines, a very serious discussion of the question, \"Can  fish be caught by tickling?\" Many contributors took part in this  discussion. There were advocates of both positive and negative side  of the question. My old friend Hubbard, an expert fisherman, of wide  experience, assured me that he, many years ago, had discarded the  landing net; that when he hooked a lake trout, a bass or a \"musky,\"  and had played his fish until it was so exhausted that it could be  reeled in and led up alongside the boat, it was his practice to  \"gently insert his hand in the water under the fish and tickle it on  the stomach, when the fish would settle down in his hand and go  to sleep, then he would lift it into the boat.\"      [Illustration: An Expert Trout Fisher]    This testimony took me back in memory to a time, many years ago, at a  little red school house on the hill, in a New England country school  district, where my young ideas took their first lessons in shooting.  \"Us fellers\" then looked upon boys of twelve and thirteen years as  the \"big boys\" of the school. We still believed in Santa Claus, and  we knew that a bird could not be caught without first \"putting salt  on its tail.\" A brook crossed the road at the foot of the hill and  ran down through farmer Barnum's pasture. In this brook, during the  noon recess and after school had closed for the day, with trousers  rolled up and with bare feet, we waded and fished. We caught them  with our hands, and we kept them alive. Each boy had his \"spring  hole,\" scooped out of the sand near the edge of the stream, in which  he kept the fish caught. Of course, whenever it rained, and the water  rose in the brook, these spring holes were washed away and the fish  escaped. But when the waters subsided, they had to be caught again.  Sometimes, we caught a chub as much as four inches long; and on rare  occasions, when a \"horned dace, a five incher\" was secured, the boy  who got him was a hero. It was the firm conviction of every boy in  our gang, that, no matter how securely a fish was cornered between  the two hands and behind and under a sod or stone, he could not  safely be lifted out of the water without first \"tickling him on the  belly.\"    Reverting to the suggestion made by Bige. There would be no doubt as  to the bear's ability to dig worms. She is an expert digger, carries  her garden tools with her. She has been known to dig a hole under a  stump or rock, six or eight feet deep, in which she sleeps all  winter. I have, myself, seen a bear dig wild turnips and have seen  rotten stumps and logs torn to bits by their claws; which was done in  a hunt for grubs. I therefore felt certain that if the bear dug any  worms she would not use them for fish bait, but would herself eat  them.    With a judicial attitude of mind, considering all the evidence  submitted, including my own early experience, I have arrived at the  conclusion that the trout was first attracted by the odor of the  bear's paw, then rubbed against the soft fur, when the bear wiggled  her toes and tickled the fish on his belly, whereupon the trout  settled down in the bear's paw, went to sleep and was tossed up on  the shore to the waiting cubs.
