Hunting them by day, moreover, in such a dense wilderness  as surrounded us, was an exceedingly tiring and really foolhardy  undertaking. In a thick jungle of the kind round Tsavo the hunted  animal has every chance against the hunter, as however careful the  latter may be, a dead twig or something of the sort is sure to crackle  just at the critical moment and so give the alarm. Still I never gave  up hope of some day finding their lair, and accordingly continued to  devote all my spare time to crawling about through the undergrowth.  Many a time when attempting to force my way through this bewildering  tangle I had to be released by my gun-bearer from the fast clutches of  the \"wait-a-bit\"; and often with immense pains I succeeded in tracing  the lions to the river after they had seized a victim, only to lose the  trail from there onwards, owing to the rocky nature of the ground which  they seemed to be careful to choose in retreating to their den.    At this early stage of the struggle, I am glad to say, the lions were  not always successful in their efforts to capture a human being for  their nightly meal, and one or two amusing incidents occurred to  relieve the tension from which our nerves were beginning to suffer. On  one occasion an enterprising bunniah (Indian trader) was riding along  on his donkey late one night, when suddenly a lion sprang out on him  knocking over both man and beast. The donkey was badly wounded, and the  lion was just about to seize the trader, when in some way or other his  claws became entangled in a rope by which two empty oil tins were  strung across the donkey's neck. The rattle and clatter made by these  as he dragged them after him gave him such a fright that he turned tail  and bolted off into the jungle, to the intense relief of the terrified  bunniah, who quickly made his way up the nearest tree and remained  there, shivering with fear, for the rest of the night.    Shortly after this episode, a Greek contractor named Themistocles  Pappadimitrini had an equally marvellous escape. He was sleeping  peacefully in his tent one night, when a lion broke in, and seized and  made off with the mattress on which he was lying. Though, rudely  awakened, the Greek was quite unhurt and suffered from nothing worse  than a bad fright. This same man, however, met with a melancholy fate  not long afterwards. He had been to the Kilima N'jaro district to buy  cattle, and on the return journey attempted to take a short cut across  country to the railway, but perished miserably of thirst on the way.    On another occasion fourteen coolies who slept together in a large tent  were one night awakened by a lion suddenly jumping on to the tent and  breaking through it. The brute landed with one claw on a coolie's  shoulder, which was badly torn; but instead of seizing the man himself,  in his hurry he grabbed a large bag of rice which happened to be lying  in the tent, and made off with it, dropping it in disgust some little  distance away when he realised his mistake.    These, however, were only the earlier efforts of the man-eaters. Later  on, as will be seen, nothing flurried or frightened them in the least,  and except as food they showed a complete contempt for human beings.  Having once marked down a victim, they would allow nothing to deter  them from securing him, whether he were protected by a thick fence, or  inside a closed tent, or sitting round a brightly burning fire. Shots,  shouting and firebrands they alike held in derision.          CHAPTER III    THE ATTACK ON THE GOODS-WAGON      All this time my own tent was pitched in an open clearing, unprotected  by a fence of any kind round it. One night when the medical officer;  Dr. Rose, was staying with me, we were awakened about midnight by  hearing something tumbling about among the tent ropes, but on going out  with a lantern we could discover nothing. Daylight, however, plainly  revealed the \"pug\" marks of a lion, so that on that occasion I fancy  one or other of us had a narrow escape. Warned by this experience, I at  once arranged to move my quarters, and went to join forces with Dr.  Brock, who had just arrived at Tsavo to take medical charge of the  district. We shared a hut of palm leaves and boughs, which we had  constructed on the eastern side of the river, close to the old caravan  route leading to Uganda; and we had it surrounded by a circular boma,  or thorn fence, about seventy yards in diameter, well made and thick  and high. Our personal servants also lived within the enclosure, and a  bright fire was always kept up throughout the night. For the sake of  coolness, Brock and I used to sit out under the verandah of this hut in  the evenings; but it was rather trying to our nerves to attempt to read  or write there, as we never knew when a lion might spring over the  boma, and be on us before we were aware. We therefore kept our rifles  within easy reach, and cast many an anxious glance out into the inky  darkness beyond the circle of the firelight. On one or two occasions,  we found in the morning that the lions had come quite close to the  fence; but fortunately they never succeeded in getting through.    By this time, too, the camps of the workmen had also been surrounded by  thorn fences; nevertheless the lions managed to jump over or to break  through some one or other of these, and regularly every few nights a  man was carried off, the reports of the disappearance of this or that  workman coming in to me with painful frequency. So long, however, as  Railhead Camp--with its two or three thousand men, scattered over a  wide area--remained at Tsavo, the coolies appeared not to take much  notice of the dreadful deaths of their comrades. Each man felt, I  suppose, that as the man-eaters had such a large number of victims to  choose from, the chances of their selecting him in particular were very  small. But when the large camp moved ahead with the railway, matters  altered considerably. I was then left with only some few hundred men to  complete the permanent works; and as all the remaining workmen were  naturally camped together, the attentions of the lions became more  apparent and made a deeper impression. A regular panic consequently  ensued, and it required all my powers of persuasion to induce the men  to stay on. In fact, I succeeded in doing so only by allowing them to  knock off all regular work until they had built exceptionally thick and  high bomas round each camp. Within these enclosures fires were kept  burning all night, and it was also the duty of the night-watchman to  keep clattering half a dozen empty oil tins suspended from a convenient  tree. These he manipulated by means of a long rope, while sitting in  safety within his tent; and the frightful noise thus produced was kept  up at frequent intervals during the night in the hopes of terrifying  away the man-eaters. In spite of all these precautions, however, the  lions would not be denied, and men continued to disappear.    When the railhead workmen moved on, their hospital camp was left  behind. It stood rather apart from the other camps, in a clearing about  three-quarters of a mile from my hut, but was protected by a good thick  fence and to all appearance was quite secure. It seemed, however, as if  barriers were of no avail against the \"demons\", for before very long  one of them found a weak spot in the boma and broke through. On this  occasion the Hospital Assistant had a marvellous escape. Hearing a  noise outside, he opened the door of his tent and was horrified to see  a great lion standing a few yards away looking at him. The beast made a  spring towards him, which gave the Assistant such a fright that he  jumped backwards, and in doing so luckily upset a box containing  medical stores. This crashed down with such a loud clatter of breaking  glass that the lion was startled for the moment and made off to another  part of the enclosure. Here, unfortunately, he was more successful, as  he jumped on to and broke through a tent in which eight patients were  lying. Two of them were badly wounded by his spring, while a third poor  wretch was seized and dragged off bodily through the thorn fence. The  two wounded coolies were left where they lay, a piece of torn tent  having fallen over them; and in this position the doctor and I found  them on our arrival soon after dawn next morning. We at once decided to  move the hospital closer to the main camp; a fresh site was prepared, a  stout hedge built round the enclosure, and all the patients were moved  in before nightfall.    As I had heard that lions generally visit recently deserted camps, I  decided to sit up all night in the vacated boma in the hope of getting  an opportunity of bagging one of them; but in the middle of my lonely  vigil I had the mortification of hearing shrieks and cries coming from  the direction of the new hospital, telling me only too plainly that our  dreaded foes had once more eluded me. Hurrying to the place at daylight  I found that one of the lions had jumped over the newly erected fence  and had carried off the hospital bhisti (water-carrier), and that  several other coolies had been unwilling witnesses of the terrible  scene which took place within the circle of light given by the big camp  fire. The bhisti, it appears, had been lying on the floor, with his  head towards the centre of the tent and his feet neatly touching the  side. The lion managed to get its head in below the canvas, seized him  by the foot and pulled him out. In desperation the unfortunate  water-carrier clutched hold of a heavy box in a vain attempt to prevent  himself being carried off, and dragged it with him until he was forced  to let go by its being stopped by the side of the tent.
