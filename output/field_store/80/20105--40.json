But there are passages in which  the order of events is deranged; in others facts are misrepresented  and erroneous assertions are made, I apprehend, not altogether  involuntarily.    I have paid particular attention to all that has been published by the  noble participators of the imperial captivity. Nothing, however, could  induce me to change a word in these Memoirs, because nothing could take  from me my conviction of the truth of what I personally heard and  saw. It will be found that Napoleon in his private conversations often  confirms what I state; but we sometimes differ, and the public must  judge between us. However, I must here make one observation.    When Napoleon dictated or related to his friends in St. Helena the facts  which they have reported he was out of the world,--he had played his  part. Fortune, which, according to his notions, had conferred on him all  his power and greatness, had recalled all her gifts before he sank into  the tomb. His ruling passion would induce him to think that it was due  to his glory to clear up certain facts which might prove an unfavourable  escort if they accompanied him to posterity. This was his fixed idea.  But is there not some ground for suspecting the fidelity of him who  writes or dictates his own history? Why might he not impose on a few  persons in St. Helena, when he was able to impose on France and Europe,  respecting many acts which emanated from him during the long duration of  his power? The life of Napoleon would be very unfaithfully written were  the author to adopt as true all his bulletins and proclamations, and all  the declarations he made at St. Helena. Such a history would frequently  be in contradiction to facts; and such only is that which might be  entitled, 'The History of Napoleon, written by Himself'.    I have said thus much because it is my wish that the principles which  have guided me in the composition of these Memoirs may be understood.  I am aware that they will not please every reader; that is a success  to which I cannot pretend. Some merit, however, may be allowed me on  account of the labour I have undergone. It has neither been of a slight  nor an agreeable kind. I made it a rule to read everything that has  been written respecting Napoleon, and I have had to decipher many of  his autograph documents, though no longer so familiar with his scrawl as  formerly. I say decipher, because a real cipher might often be much more  readily understood than the handwriting of Napoleon. My own notes, too,  which were often very hastily made, in the hand I wrote in my youth,  have sometimes also much embarrassed me.    My long and intimate connection with Bonaparte from boyhood, my close  relations with him when General, Consul, and Emperor, enabled me to see  and appreciate all that was projected and all that was done during  that considerable and momentous period of time. I not only had the  opportunity of being present at the conception and the execution of the  extraordinary deeds of one of the ablest men nature ever formed, but,  notwithstanding an almost unceasing application to business, I found  means to employ the few moments of leisure which Bonaparte left at my  disposal in making notes, collecting documents, and in recording for  history facts respecting which the truth could otherwise with difficulty  be ascertained; and more particularly in collecting those ideas, often  profound, brilliant, and striking, but always remarkable, to which  Bonaparte gave expression in the overflowing frankness of confidential  intimacy.    The knowledge that I possessed much important information has exposed me  to many inquiries, and wherever I have resided since my retirement from  public affairs much of my time has been spent in replying to questions.  The wish to be acquainted with the most minute details of the life of a  man formed on an unexampled model is very natural; and the observation  on my replies by those who heard them always was, \"You should publish  your Memoirs!\"    I had certainly always in view the publication of my Memoirs; but, at  the same time, I was firmly resolved not to publish them until a period  should arrive in which I might tell the truth, and the whole truth.  While Napoleon was in the possession of power I felt it right to resist  the urgent applications made to me on this subject by some persons  of the highest distinction. Truth would then have sometimes appeared  flattery, and sometimes, also, it might not have been without danger.  Afterwards, when the progress of events removed Bonaparte to a far  distant island in the midst of the ocean, silence was imposed on me by  other considerations,-by considerations of propriety and feeling.    After the death of Bonaparte, at St. Helena, reasons of a different  nature retarded the execution of my plan. The tranquillity of a secluded  retreat was indispensable for preparing and putting in order the  abundant materials in my possession. I found it also necessary to read a  great number of works, in order to rectify important errors to which the  want of authentic documents had induced the authors to give credit. This  much-desired retreat was found. I had the good fortune to be introduced,  through a friend, to the Duchesse de Brancas, and that lady invited me  to pass some time on one of her estates in Hainault. Received with the  most agreeable hospitality, I have there enjoyed that tranquillity which  could alone have rendered the publication of these volumes practicable.    FAUVELET DE BOURRIENNE        NOTE.    The Editor of the 1836 edition had added to the Memoirs several chapters  taken from or founded on other works of the time, so as to make a  more complete history of the period. These materials have been mostly  retained, but with the corrections which later publications have made  necessary. A chapter has now been added to give, a brief account of the  part played by the chief historical personages during the Cent Jours,  and another at the end to include the removal of the body of Napoleon  from St. Helena to France.    Two special improvements have, it is hoped, been made in this edition.  Great care has been taken to get names, dates, and figures rightly  given,--points much neglected in most translations, though in some few  cases, such as Davoust, the ordinary but not strictly correct spelling  has been followed to suit the general reader. The number of references  to other works which are given in the notes will, it is believed, be of  use to any one wishing to continue the study of the history of Napoleon,  and may preserve them from many of the errors too often committed. The  present Editor has had the great advantage of having his work shared  by Mr. Richard Bentley, who has brought his knowledge of the period  to bear, and who has found, as only a busy man could do, the time to  minutely enter into every fresh detail, with the ardour which soon  seizes any one who long follows that enticing pursuit, the special study  of an historical period.

Authentic date of Bonaparte's birth--His family ruined by the     Jesuits--His taste for military amusements--Sham siege at the     College of Brienne--The porter's wife and Napoleon--My intimacy with     Bonaparte at college--His love for the mathematics, and his dislike     of Latin--He defends Paoli and blames his father--He is ridiculed by     his comrades--Ignorance of the monks--Distribution of prizes at     Brienne--Madame de Montesson and the Duke of Orleans--Report of M.     Keralio on Bonaparte--He leaves Brienne.    NAPOLEON BONAPARTE was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, on the 15th of  August 1769; the original orthography of his name was Buonaparte, but he  suppressed the \"u\" during his first campaign in Italy. His motives  for so doing were merely to render the spelling conformable with the  pronunciation, and to abridge his signature. He signed Buonaparte even  after the famous 13th Vendemiaire.    It has been affirmed that he was born in 1768, and that he represented  himself to be a year younger than he really was. This is untrue. He  always told me the 9th of August was his birthday, and, as I was born  on the 9th of July 1769, our proximity of age served to strengthen  our union and friendship when we were both at the Military College of  Brienne.    The false and absurd charge of Bonaparte having misrepresented his  age, is decidedly refuted by a note in the register of M. Berton,  sub-principal of the College of Brienne, in which it is stated that M.  Napoleon de Buonaparte, ecuyer, born in the city of Ajaccio, in Corsica,  on the 15th of August 1769, left the Royal Military College of Brienne  on the 17th October 1784.    The stories about his low extraction are alike devoid of foundation. His  family was poor, and he was educated at the public expense, an advantage  of which many honourable families availed themselves. A memorial  addressed by his father, Charles Buonaparte, to the Minister of  War states that his fortune had been reduced by the failure of some  enterprise in which he had engaged, and by the injustice of the Jesuits,  by whom he had been deprived of an inheritance. The object of this  memorial was to solicit a sub-lieutenant's commission for Napoleon, who  was then fourteen years of age, and to get Lucien entered a pupil of the  Military College. The Minister wrote on the back of the memorial, \"Give  the usual answer, if there be a vacancy;\" and on the margin are  these words--\"This gentleman has been informed that his request is  inadmissible as long as his second son remains at the school of Brienne.  Two brothers cannot be placed at the same time in the military schools.\"  When Napoleon was fifteen he was sent to Paris until he should attain "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#5)"],[1,"rowe, however,  claims him as a \"Prussian\" both because of his long residence in the  Prussian-Polish bishopric of Ermeland, and because of Copernicus's own  reference to Prussia as \"unser lieber Vaterland.\" (Prowe: II, 197.)]    [Footnote 73: Prowe: I, 73-82.]    After the elementary training in the Thorn school,[74] the lad entered  the university at Cracow, his father's former home, where he studied  under the faculty of arts from 1491-1494.[75] Nowhere else north of  the Alps at this time were mathematics and astronomy in better  standing than at this university.[76] Sixteen teachers taught these  subjects there during the years of Copernicus's stay, but no record  exists of his work under any of them.[77] That he must have studied  these two sciences there, however, is proved by Rheticus's remark in  the _Narratio Prima_[78] that Copernicus, after leaving Cracow, went  to Bologna to work with Dominicus Maria di Novara \"non tarn discipulus  quam adjutor.\" He left Cracow without receiving a degree,[79] returned  to Thorn in 1494 when he and his family decided he should enter the  Church after first studying in Italy.[80] Consequently he crossed the  Alps in 1496 and was that winter matriculated at Bologna in the  \"German nation.\"[81] The following summer he received word of his  appointment to fill a vacancy among the canons of the cathedral  chapter at Ermeland where his uncle had been bishop since 1489.[82] He  remained in Italy, however, about ten years altogether, studying civil  law at Bologna, and canon law and medicine at Padua,[83] yet receiving  his degree as doctor of canon law from the university of Ferrara in  1503.[84] He was also in Rome for several months during the Jubilee  year, 1500.

This insured him an annual income which  amounted to a sum equalling about $2250 today. Later he received a  sinecure appointment besides at Breslau. (Holden in _Pop. Sci._,  111.)]    [Footnote 83: Prowe: I, 224.]    [Footnote 84: Ibid: I, 308.]    At this period the professor of astronomy at Bologna was the famous  teacher Dominicus Maria di Novara (1454-1504), a man \"ingenio et animo  liber\" who dared to attack the immutability of the Ptolemaic system,  since his own observations, especially of the Pole Star, differed by a  degree and more from the traditional ones.[85] He dared to criticise  the long accepted system and to emphasize the Pythagorean notion of  the underlying harmony and simplicity in nature[86]; and from him  Copernicus may have acquired these ideas, for whether they lived  together or not in Bologna, they were closely associated. It was here,  too, that Copernicus began his study of Greek which later was to be  the means[87] of encouraging him in his own theorizing by acquainting  him with the ancients who had thought along similar lines.    [Footnote 85: Ibid: I, 240 and note. Little is known about him today,  except that he was primarily an observer, and was highly esteemed by  his immediate successors; see Gilbert: _De Magnete_.]    [Footnote 86: Clerke in _Ency. Brit._, \"Novara.\"]    [Footnote 87: Prowe: I, 249.]    In the spring of the year (1501) following his visit to Rome,[88]  Copernicus returned to the Chapter at Frauenburg to get further leave  of absence to study medicine at the University of Padua.[89] Whether  he received a degree at Padua or not and how long he stayed there are  uncertain points.[90] He was back in Ermeland early in 1506.    [Footnote 88: Prowe: I, 279.]    [Footnote 89: Ibid, 294.]    [Footnote 90: Ibid: I, 319.]    His student days were ended. And now for many years he led a very  active life, first as companion and assistant to his uncle the Bishop,  with whom he stayed at Schloss Heilsberg till after the Bishop's death  in 1512; then as one of the leading canons of the chapter at  Frauenburg, where he lived most of the rest of his life.[91] As the  chapter representative for five years (at intervals) he had oversight  of the spiritual and temporal affairs of two large districts in the  care of the chapter.[92] He went on various diplomatic and other  missions to the King of Poland,[93] to Duke Albrecht of the Teutonic  Order,[94] and to the councils of the German states.[95] He wrote a  paper of considerable weight upon the much needed reform of the  Prussian currency.[96] His skill as a physician was in demand not only  in his immediate circle[97] but in adjoining countries, Duke Albrecht  once summoning him to Koenigsberg to attend one of his courtiers.[98]  He was a humanist as well as a Catholic Churchman, and though he did  not approve of the Protestant Revolt, he favored reform and  toleration.[99] Gassendi claims that he was also a painter, at least  in his student days, and that he painted portraits well received by  his contemporaries.[100] But his interest and skill in astronomy must  have been recognized early in his life for in 1514 the committee of  the Lateran Council in charge of the reform of the calendar summoned  him to their aid.[101]    [Footnote 91: Prowe: I, 335-380.]    [Footnote 92: Ibid: II, 75-110, 116, 124.]    [Footnote 93: Ibid: II, 204-8.]    [Footnote 94: Ibid: II, 110.]    [Footnote 95: Ibid: II, 144.]    [Footnote 96: Ibid: II, 146.]    [Footnote 97: Ibid: II, 293-319.]    [Footnote 98: Ibid: II, 464-472.]    [Footnote 99: Ibid: II, 170-187.]    [Footnote 100: Holden in _Pop. Sci._, 109.]    [Footnote 101: Prowe: II, 67-70.]    He was no cloistered monk devoting all his time to the study of the  heavens, but a cultivated man of affairs, of recognized ability in  business and statesmanship, and a leader among his fellow canons. His  mathematical and astronomical pursuits were the occupations of his  somewhat rare leisure moments, except perhaps during the six years  with his uncle in the comparative freedom of the bishop's castle, and  during the last ten or twelve years of his life, after his request for  a coadjutor had resulted in lightening his duties. In his masterwork  _De Revolutionibus_[102] there are recorded only 27 of his own  astronomical observations, and these extend over the years from 1497  to 1529. The first was made at Bologna, the second at Rome in 1500,  and seven of the others at Frauenburg, where the rest were also  probably made. It is believed the greater part of the _De  Revolutionibus_ was written at Heilsburg[103] where Copernicus was  free from his chapter duties, for as he himself says[104] in the  Dedication to the Pope (dated 1543) his work had been formulated not  merely nine years but for \"more than three nines of years.\" It had not  been neglected all this time, however, as the original MS. (now in the  Prague Library) with its innumerable changes and corrections shows how  continually he worked over it, altering and correcting the tables and  verifying his statements.[105]    [Footnote 102: Copernicus: _De Revolutionibus_, Thorn edit., 444. The  last two words of the full title: _De Revolutionibus Orbium  Coelestium_ are not on the original MS. and are believed to have  been added by Osiander. Prowe: II, 541, note.]    [Footnote 103: Ibid: II, 490-1.]    [Footnote 104: Copernicus: Dedication, 4. (Thorn edit.)]    [Footnote 105: Prowe: II, 503-508.]    Copernicus was a philosopher.[106] He thought out a new explanation of  the world machine with relatively little practical work of his  own,[107] though we know he controlled his results by the accumulated  observations of the ages.[108] His instruments were inadequate,  inaccurate and out of date even in his time, for much better ones were  then being made at Nuernberg[109]; and the cloudy climate of Ermeland  as well as his own active career prevented him from the  long-continued, painstaking observing, which men like Tycho Brahe were  to carry on later. Despite such handicaps, because of his  dissatisfaction with the complexities and intricacies of the Ptolemaic  system and because of his conviction that the laws of nature were  simple and harmonious, Copernicus searched the writings of the classic  philosophers, as he himself tells us,[110] to see what other  explanation of the universe had been suggested. \"And I found first in  Cicero that a certain Nicetas had thought the earth moved. Later in  Plutarch I found certain others had been of the same opinion.\" He  quoted the Greek referring to Philolaus the Pythagorean, Heraclides of  Pontus, and Ecphantes the Pythagorean.[111] As a result he began to  consider the mobility of the earth and found that such an explanation  seemingly solved many astronomical problems with a simplicity and a  harmony utterly lacking in the old traditional scheme. Unaided by a  telescope, he worked out in part the right theory of the universe and  for the first time in history placed all the then known planets in  their true positions with the sun at the center. He claimed that the  earth turns on its axis as it travels around the sun, and careens  slowly as it goes, thus by these three motions explaining many of the  apparent movements of the sun and the planets. He retained,[112]  however, the immobile heaven of the fixed stars (though vastly farther  off in order to account for the non-observance of any stellar  parallax[113]), the \"perfect\" and therefore circular orbits of the  planets, certain of the old eccentrics, and 34 new epicycles in place  of all the old ones which he had cast aside.[114] He accepted the  false notion of trepidation enunciated by the Arabs in the 9th century  and later overthrown by Tycho Brahe.[115] His calculations were  weak.[116] But his great book is a sane and modern work in an age of  astrology and superstition.[117] His theory is a triumph of reason "]]]
