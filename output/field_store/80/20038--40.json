So far as possible, families and  individuals were assigned to living quarters, not too far from the  plants or offices in which their work lay.    All able-bodied men and women alternated in two-week periods between  military and industrial service, except those who were needed for  household work. Since working conditions in the plants and offices were  ideal, and everybody thus had plenty of healthy outdoor activity in  addition, the population was sturdy and active. Laziness was regarded as  nearly the greatest of social offenses. Hard work and general merit were  variously rewarded with extra privileges, advancement to positions of  authority, and with various items of personal equipment for convenience  and luxury.    In leisure moments, I got great enjoyment from sitting outside the  dwelling in which I was quartered with Bill Hearn and ten other men,  watching the occasional passers-by, as with leisurely, but swift  movements, they swung up and down the forest trail, rising from the  ground in long almost-horizontal leaps, occasionally swinging from one  convenient branch overhead to another before \"sliding\" back to the  ground farther on. Normal traveling pace, where these trails were  straight enough, was about twenty miles an hour. Such things as  automobiles and railroad trains (the memory of them not more than a  month old in my mind) seemed inexpressibly silly and futile compared  with such convenience as these belts or jumpers offered.    Bill suggested that I wander around for several days, from plant to  plant, to observe and study what I could. The entire community had been  apprised of my coming, my rating as an \"exchange\" reaching every  building and post in the community, by means of ultronic broadcast.  Everywhere I was welcomed in an interested and helpful spirit.    I visited the plants where ultronic vibrations were isolated from the  ether and through slow processes built up into sub-electronic,  electronic and atomic forms into the two great synthetic elements,  ultron and inertron. I learned something, superficially at least, of the  processes of combined chemical and mechanical action through which were  produced the various forms of synthetic cloth. I watched the manufacture  of the machines which were used at locations of construction to produce  the various forms of building materials. But I was particularly  interested in the munitions plants and the rocket-ship shops.    Ultron is a solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity,  which has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those  pulsations known as light, electricity and heat. Since it is completely  permeable to light vibrations, it is therefore _absolutely invisible and  non-reflective_. Its magnetic response is almost, but not quite, 100  percent also. It is therefore very heavy under normal conditions but  extremely responsive to the _repellor_ or anti-gravity rays, such as the  Hans use as \"_legs_\" for their airships.    Inertron is the second great triumph of American research and  experimentation with ultronic forces. It was developed just a few years  before my awakening in the abandoned mine. It is a synthetic element,  built up, through a complicated heterodyning of ultronic pulsations,  from \"infra-balanced\" sub-ionic forms. It is completely inert to both  electric and magnetic forces in all the orders above the _ultronic_;  that is to say, the _sub-electronic_, the _electronic_, the _atomic_ and  the _molecular_. In consequence it has a number of amazing and  valuable properties. One of these is _the total lack of weight_. Another  is a total lack of heat. It has no molecular vibration whatever. It  reflects 100 percent of the heat and light impinging upon it. It does  not feel cold to the touch, of course, since it will not absorb the heat  of the hand. It is a solid, very dense in molecular structure despite  its lack of weight, of great strength and considerable elasticity. It is  a perfect shield against the disintegrator rays.    [Illustration: Setting his rocket gun for a long-distance shot.]    Rocket guns are very simple contrivances so far as the mechanism of  launching the bullet is concerned. They are simple light tubes, closed  at the rear end, with a trigger-actuated pin for piercing the thin skin  at the base of the cartridge. This piercing of the skin starts the  chemical and atomic reaction. The entire cartridge leaves the tube under  its own power, at a very easy initial velocity, just enough to insure  accuracy of aim; so the tube does not have to be of heavy construction.  The bullet increases in velocity as it goes. It may be solid or  explosive. It may explode on contact or on time, or a combination of  these two.    Bill and I talked mostly of weapons, military tactics and strategy.  Strangely enough he had no idea whatever of the possibilities of the  barrage, though the tremendous effect of a \"curtain of fire\" with such  high-explosive projectiles as these modern rocket guns used was obvious  to me. But the barrage idea, it seemed, has been lost track of  completely in the air wars that followed the First World War, and in the  peculiar guerilla tactics developed by Americans in the later period of  operations from the ground against Han airships, and in the gang wars  which, until a few generations ago I learned, had been almost  continuous.    \"I wonder,\" said Bill one day, \"if we couldn't work up some form of  barrage to spring on the Bad Bloods. The Big Boss told me today that  he's been in communication with the other gangs, and all are agreed that  the Bad Bloods might as well be wiped out for good. That attempt on  Wilma Deering's life and their evident desire to make trouble among the  gangs, has stirred up every community east of the Alleghenies. The Boss  says that none of the others will object if we go after them. So I  imagine that before long we will. Now show me again how you worked that  business in the Argonne forest. The conditions ought to be pretty much  the same.\"    I went over it with him in detail, and gradually we worked out a  modified plan that would be better adapted to our more powerful weapons,  and the use of jumpers.    \"It will be easy,\" Bill exulted. \"I'll slide down and talk it over with  the Boss tomorrow.\"    During the first two weeks of my stay with the Wyomings, Wilma Deering  and I saw a great deal of each other. I naturally felt a little closer  friendship for her, in view of the fact that she was the first human  being I saw after waking from my long sleep; her appreciation of my  saving her life, though I could not have done otherwise than I did in  that matter, and most of all my own appreciation of the fact that she  had not found it as difficult as the others to believe my story,  operated in the same direction. I could easily imagine my story must  have sounded incredible.    It was natural enough too, that she should feel an unusual interest in  me. In the first place, I was her personal discovery. In the second, she  was a girl of studious and reflective turn of mind. She never got tired  of my stories and descriptions of the 20th Century.    The others of the community, however, seemed to find our friendship a  bit amusing. It seemed that Wilma had a reputation for being cold toward  the opposite sex, and so others, not being able to appreciate some of  her fine qualities as I did, misinterpreted her attitude, much to their  own delight. Wilma and I, however, ignored this as much as we could.          CHAPTER IV    A Han Air Raid      There was a girl in Wilma's camp named Gerdi Mann, with whom Bill Hearn  was desperately in love, and the four of us used to go around a lot  together. Gerdi was a distinct type. Whereas Wilma had the usual dark  brown hair and hazel eyes that marked nearly every member of the  community, Gerdi had red hair, blue eyes and very fair skin. She has  been dead many years now, but I remember her vividly because she was a  throwback in physical appearance to a certain 20th Century type which I  have found very rare among modern Americans; also because the four of us  were engaged one day in a discussion of this very point, when I obtained  my first experience of a Han air raid.    We were sitting high on the side of a hill overlooking the valley that  teemed with human activity, invisible beneath its blanket of foliage.    The other three, who knew of the Irish but vaguely and indefinitely, as  a race on the other side of the globe, which, like ourselves, had  succeeded in maintaining a precarious and fugitive existence in  rebellion against the Mongolian domination of the earth, were listening  with interest to my theory that Gerdi's ancestors of several hundred  years ago must have been Irish. I explained that Gerdi was an Irish  type, evidently a throwback, and that her surname might well have been  McMann, or McMahan, and still more anciently \"mac Mathghamhain.\" They  were interested too in my surmise that \"Gerdi\" was the same name as that  which had been \"Gerty\" or \"Gertrude\" in the 20th Century.    In the middle of our discussion, we were startled by an alarm rocket  that burst high in the air, far to the north, spreading a pall of red  smoke that drifted like a cloud. It was followed by others at scattered  points in the northern sky.    \"A Han raid!\" Bill exclaimed in amazement. \"The first in seven years!\"    \"Maybe it's just one of their ships off its course,\" I ventured.    \"No,\" said Wilma in some agitation. \"That would be green rockets. Red  means only one thing, Tony. They're sweeping the countryside with their  dis beams. Can you see anything, Bill?\"    \"We had better get under cover,\" Gerdi said nervously. \"The four of us  are bunched here in the open. For all we know they may be twelve miles  up, out of sight, yet looking at us with a projecto'.\"    Bill had been sweeping the horizon hastily with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#5)"],[1,"able to answer _my_ questions after his own  have been answered.\"    And therewith he turned and swung himself out of the hall.    When he was well gone, I said: \"Is it wrong to ask what Mr. Boffin is?  whose name, by the way, reminds me of many pleasant hours passed in  reading Dickens.\"    Dick laughed.  \"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"as it does us.  I see you take the  allusion.  Of course his real name is not Boffin, but Henry Johnson; we  only call him Boffin as a joke, partly because he is a dustman, and  partly because he will dress so showily, and get as much gold on him as a  baron of the Middle Ages.  As why should he not if he likes? only we are  his special friends, you know, so of course we jest with him.\"    I held my tongue for some time after that; but Dick went on:    \"He is a capital fellow, and you can't help liking him; but he has a  weakness: he will spend his time in writing reactionary novels, and is  very proud of getting the local colour right, as he calls it; and as he  thinks you come from some forgotten corner of the earth, where people are  unhappy, and consequently interesting to a story-teller, he thinks he  might get some information out of you.  O, he will be quite  straightforward with you, for that matter.  Only for your own comfort  beware of him!\"    \"Well, Dick,\" said the weaver, doggedly, \"I think his novels are very  good.\"    \"Of course you do,\" said Dick; \"birds of a feather flock together;  mathematics and antiquarian novels stand on much the same footing.  But  here he comes again.\"    And in effect the Golden Dustman hailed us from the hall-door; so we all  got up and went into the porch, before which, with a strong grey horse in  the shafts, stood a carriage ready for us which I could not help  noticing.  It was light and handy, but had none of that sickening  vulgarity which I had known as inseparable from the carriages of our  time, especially the \"elegant\" ones, but was as graceful and pleasant in  line as a Wessex waggon.  We got in, Dick and I.  The girls, who had come  into the porch to see us off, waved their hands to us; the weaver nodded  kindly; the dustman bowed as gracefully as a troubadour; Dick shook the  reins, and we were off.          CHAPTER IV: A MARKET BY THE WAY      We turned away from the river at once, and were soon in the main road  that runs through Hammersmith.  But I should have had no guess as to  where I was, if I had not started from the waterside; for King Street was  gone, and the highway ran through wide sunny meadows and garden-like  tillage.  The Creek, which we crossed at once, had been rescued from its  culvert, and as we went over its pretty bridge we saw its waters, yet  swollen by the tide, covered with gay boats of different sizes.  There  were houses about, some on the road, some amongst the fields with  pleasant lanes leading down to them, and each surrounded by a teeming  garden.  They were all pretty in design, and as solid as might be, but  countryfied in appearance, like yeomen's dwellings; some of them of red  brick like those by the river, but more of timber and plaster, which were  by the necessity of their construction so like mediaeval houses of the  same materials that I fairly felt as if I were alive in the fourteenth  century; a sensation helped out by the costume of the people that we met  or passed, in whose dress there was nothing \"modern.\"  Almost everybody  was gaily dressed, but especially the women, who were so well-looking, or  even so handsome, that I could scarcely refrain my tongue from calling my  companion's attention to the fact.  Some faces I saw that were  thoughtful, and in these I noticed great nobility of expression, but none  that had a glimmer of unhappiness, and the greater part (we came upon a  good many people) were frankly and openly joyous.    I thought I knew the Broadway by the lie of the roads that still met  there.  On the north side of the road was a range of buildings and  courts, low, but very handsomely built and ornamented, and in that way  forming a great contrast to the unpretentiousness of the houses round  about; while above this lower building rose the steep lead-covered roof  and the buttresses and higher part of the wall of a great hall, of a  splendid and exuberant style of architecture, of which one can say little  more than that it seemed to me to embrace the best qualities of the  Gothic of northern Europe with those of the Saracenic and Byzantine,  though there was no copying of any one of these styles.  On the other,  the south side, of the road was an octagonal building with a high roof,  not unlike the Baptistry at Florence in outline, except that it was  surrounded by a lean-to that clearly made an arcade or cloisters to it:  it also was most delicately ornamented.    This whole mass of architecture which we had come upon so suddenly from  amidst the pleasant fields was not only exquisitely beautiful in itself,  but it bore upon it the expression of such generosity and abundance of  life that I was exhilarated to a pitch that I had never yet reached.  I  fairly chuckled for pleasure.  My friend seemed to understand it, and sat  looking on me with a pleased and affectionate interest.  We had pulled up  amongst a crowd of carts, wherein sat handsome healthy-looking people,  men, women, and children very gaily dressed, and which were clearly  market carts, as they were full of very tempting-looking country produce.    I said, \"I need not ask if this is a market, for I see clearly that it  is; but what market is it that it is so splendid?  And what is the  glorious hall there, and what is the building on the south side?\"    \"O,\" said he, \"it is just our Hammersmith market; and I am glad you like  it so much, for we are really proud of it.  Of course the hall inside is  our winter Mote-House; for in summer we mostly meet in the fields down by  the river opposite Barn Elms.  The building on our right hand is our  theatre: I hope you like it.\"    \"I should be a fool if I didn't,\" said I.    He blushed a little as he said: \"I am glad of that, too, because I had a  hand in it; I made the great doors, which are of damascened bronze.  We  will look at them later in the day, perhaps: but we ought to be getting  on now.  As to the market, this is not one of our busy days; so we shall  do better with it another time, because you will see more people.\"    I thanked him, and said: \"Are these the regular country people?  What  very pretty girls there are amongst them.\"    As I spoke, my eye caught the face of a beautiful woman, tall,  dark-haired, and white-skinned, dressed in a pretty light-green dress in  honour of the season and the hot day, who smiled kindly on me, and more  kindly still, I thought on Dick; so I stopped a minute, but presently  went on:    \"I ask because I do not see any of the country-looking people I should  have expected to see at a market--I mean selling things there.\"    \"I don't understand,\" said he, \"what kind of people you would expect to  see; nor quite what you mean by 'country' people.  These are the  neighbours, and that like they run in the Thames valley.  There are parts  of these islands which are rougher and rainier than we are here, and  there people are rougher in their dress; and they themselves are tougher  and more hard-bitten than we are to look at.  But some people like their  looks better than ours; they say they have more character in them--that's  the word.  Well, it's a matter of taste.--Anyhow, the cross between us  and them generally turns out well,\" added he, thoughtfully.    I heard him, though my eyes were turned away from him, for that pretty  girl was just disappearing through the gate with her big basket of early  peas, and I felt that disappointed kind of feeling which overtakes one  when one has seen an interesting or lovely face in the streets which one  is never likely to see again; and I was silent a little.  At last I said:  \"What I mean is, that I haven't seen any poor people about--not one.\"    He knit his brows, looked puzzled, and said: \"No, naturally; if anybody  is poorly, he is likely to be within doors, or at best crawling about the  garden: but I don't know of any one sick at present.  Why should you  expect to see poorly people on the road?\"    \"No, no,\" I said; \"I don't mean sick people.  I mean poor people, you  know; rough people.\"    \"No,\" said he, smiling merrily, \"I really do not know.  The fact is, you  must come along quick to my great-grandfather, who will understand you  better than I do.  Come on, Greylocks!\"  Therewith he shook the reins,  and we jogged along merrily eastward.          CHAPTER V: CHILDREN ON THE ROAD      Past the Broadway there were fewer houses on either side.  We presently  crossed a pretty little brook that ran across a piece of land dotted over  with trees, and awhile after came to another market and town-hall, as we  should call it.  Although there was nothing familiar to me in its  surroundings, I knew pretty well where we were, and was not surprised  when my guide said briefly, \"Kensington Market.\"    Just after this we came into a short street of houses: or rather, one  long house on either side of the way, built of timber and plaster, and  with a pretty arcade over the footway before it.    Quoth Dick: \"This is Kensington proper.  People are apt to gather here  rather thick, for they like the romance of the wood; and naturalists  haunt it, too; for it is a wild spot even here, what there is of it; for  it does not go far to the south: it goes from here northward and west  right over Paddington and a little way down Notting Hill: thence it runs  north-east to Primrose Hill, and so on; rather a narrow strip of it gets  through Kingsland to Stoke-Newington and Clapton, where it spreads out  along the heights above the Lea marshes; on the other side of which, as  you know, is Epping Forest holding out a hand to it.  This part we are  just coming to is called Kensington Gardens;"]]]
