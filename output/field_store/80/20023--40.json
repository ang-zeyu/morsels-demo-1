For, although no one actually mistreated the chu-wugg, the men avoided  him as much as possible. Often Iversen would come upon the little fellow  weeping from loneliness in a corner with no one to play with and, giving  in to his own human weakness, the captain would dry the creature's  tears and comfort him. In return, the chu-wugg would laugh at all his  jokes, for he seemed to have acquired an elementary knowledge of Terran.           *       *       *       *       *    \"By Vindemiatrix, Lieutenant,\" the captain roared as Harkaway, foiled in  his attempt to scurry off unobserved, stood quivering before him, \"why  have you been avoiding me like this?\"    \"I didn't think I was avoiding you any particular way, sir,\" Harkaway  said. \"I mean does it appear like that, sir? It's only that I've been  busy with my duties, sir.\"    \"I don't know what's the matter with you! I told you I handsomely  forgave you for your mistake.\"    \"But I can never forgive myself, sir--\"    \"Are you trying to go over my head?\" Iversen thundered.    \"No, sir. I--\"    \"If I am willing to forgive you, you will forgive yourself. That's an  order!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" the young man said feebly.    Harkaway had changed back to his uniform, Iversen noted, but he looked  unkempt, ill, harrowed. The boy had really been suffering for his  precipitance. Perhaps the captain himself had been a little hard on him.    Iversen modulated his tone to active friendliness. \"Thought you might  like to know the chu-wugg turned into a hoop-snake this morning!\"    But Harkaway did not seem cheered by this social note. \"So soon!\"    \"You knew there would be a fourth metamorphosis!\" Iversen was  disappointed. But he realized that Harkaway was bound to have acquired  such fundamental data, no matter how he interpreted them. It was  possible, Iversen thought, that the book could actually have some value,  if there were some way of weeding fact from fancy, and surely there must  be scholars trained in such an art, for Earth had many wholly indigenous  texts of like nature.    \"He's a thor'glitch now,\" Harkaway told him dully.    \"And what comes next?... No, don't tell me. It's more fun not knowing  beforehand. You know,\" Iversen went on, almost rubbing his hands  together, \"I think this species is going to excite more interest on  Earth than the Flimbotzik themselves. After all, people are people, even  if they're green, but an animal that changes shape so many times and so  radically is really going to set biologists by the ears. What did you  say the name of the species as a whole was?\"    \"I--I couldn't say, sir.\"    \"Ah,\" Iversen remarked waggishly, \"so there are one or two things you  don't know about Flimbot, eh?\"    Harkaway opened his mouth, but only a faint bleating sound came out.           *       *       *       *       *    As the days went on, Iversen found himself growing fonder and fonder of  the thor'glitch. Finally, in spite of the fact that it had now attained  the dimensions of a well-developed boa constrictor, he took it to live  in his quarters.    Many was the quiet evening they spent together, Iversen entering acid  comments upon the crew in the ship's log, while the thor'glitch looked  over viewtapes from the ship's library.    The captain was surprised to find how much he--well, enjoyed this  domestic tranquility. I must be growing old, he thought--old and mellow.  And he named the creature Bridey, after a twentieth-century figure who  had, he believed, been connected with another metempsychotic furor.    When the thor'glitch grew listless and began to swell in the middle,  Iversen got alarmed and sent for Dr. Smullyan.    \"Aha!\" the medical officer declaimed, with a casual glance at the  suffering snake. \"The day of reckoning is at hand! Reap the fruit of  your transgression, scurvy humans! Calamity approaches with jets  aflame!\"    Iversen clutched the doctor's sleeve. \"Is he--is he going to die?\"    \"Unhand me, presumptuous navigator!\" Dr. Smullyan shook the captain's  fingers off his arm. \"I didn't say he was going to die,\" he offered in  ordinary bedside tones. \"Not being a specialist in this particular  sector, I am not qualified to offer an opinion, but, strictly off the  record, I would hazard the guess that he's about to metamorphose again.\"    \"He never did it in public before,\" Iversen said worriedly.    \"The old order changeth,\" Smullyan told him. \"You'd better call  Harkaway.\"    \"What does _he_ know!\"    \"Too little and, at the same time, too much,\" the doctor declaimed,  dissociating himself professionally from the case. \"Too much and too  little. Eat, drink, be merry, iniquitous Earthmen, for you died  yesterday!\"    \"Oh, shut up,\" Iversen said automatically, and dispatched a message to  Harkaway with the information that the thor'glitch appeared to be  metamorphosing again and that his presence was requested in the  captain's cabin.    [Illustration]    The rest of the officers accompanied Harkaway, all of them with the air  of attending a funeral rather than a rebirth, Iversen noted nervously.  They weren't armed, though, so Bridey couldn't be turning into anything  dangerous.           *       *       *       *       *    Now it came to pass that the thor'glitch's mid-section, having swelled  to unbearable proportions, began to quiver. Suddenly, the skin split  lengthwise and dropped cleanly to either side, like a banana peel.    Iversen pressed forward to see what fresh life-form the bulging cavity  had held. The other officers all stood in a somber row without moving,  for all along, Iversen realized, they had known what to expect, what was  to come. And they had not told him. But then, he knew, it was his own  fault; he had refused to be told.    Now, looking down at the new life-form, he saw for himself what it was.  Lying languidly in the thor'glitch skin was a slender youth of a pallor  which seemed excessive even for a member of a green-skinned race. He had  large limpid eyes and a smile of ineffable sweetness.    \"By Nopus Secundus,\" Iversen groaned. \"I'm sunk.\"    \"Naturally the ultimate incarnation for a life-form would be humanoid,\"  Harkaway said with deep reproach. \"What else?\"    \"I'm surprised you didn't figure that out for yourself, sir,\" the first  officer added. \"Even if you did refuse to read Harkaway's book, it seems  obvious.\"    \"Does it?\" Smullyan challenged. \"Does it, indeed? Is Man the highest  form of life in an irrational cosmos? Then all causes are lost ones!...  So many worlds,\" he muttered in more subdued tones, \"so much to do, so  little done, such things to be!\"    \"The Flimbotzik were telling Harkaway about their _own_ life cycle,\"  Iversen whispered as revelation bathed him in its murky light. \"The  human embryo undergoes a series of changes _inside_ the womb. It's just  that the Flimbotzik fetus develops _outside_ the womb.\"    \"Handily bypassing the earliest and most unpleasant stages of humanity,\"  Smullyan sighed. \"Oh, idyllic planet, where one need never be a  child--where one need never see a child!\"    \"Then they were trying to explain their biology to you quite clearly and  coherently, you lunkhead,\" Iversen roared at Harkaway, \"and you took it  for a religious doctrine!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Harkaway said weakly. \"I--I kind of figured that out myself  in these last few weeks of intensive soul-searching. I--I'm sorry, sir.  All I can say is that it was an honest mistake.\"    \"Why, they weren't necessarily pet-lovers at all. Those animals they had  with them were.... By Nair al Zaurak!\" The captain's voice rose to a  shriek as the whole enormity of the situation finally dawned upon him.  \"You went and kidnaped one of the children!\"    \"That's a serious charge, kidnaping,\" the first officer said with  melancholy pleasure. \"And you, as head of this expedition, Captain, are  responsible. Ironic, isn't it?\"    \"Told you all this spelled doom and disaster,\" the doctor observed  cheerfully.    Just then, the young humanoid sat up--with considerable effort, Iversen  was disturbed to notice. But perhaps that was one of the consequences of  being born. A new-born infant was weak; why not a new-born adult, then?    \"Why doom?\" the humanoid asked in a high, clear voice. \"Why disaster?\"    \"You--you speak Terran?\" the captain stammered.    Bridey gave his sad, sweet smile. \"I was reared amongst you. You are my  people. Why should I not speak your tongue?\"    \"But we're not your people,\" Iversen blurted, thinking perhaps the youth  did not remember back to his greechi days. \"We're an entirely different  species--\"    \"Our souls vibrate in unison and that is the vital essence. But do not  be afraid, shipmates; the Flimbotzik do not regard the abduction of a  transitory corporeal shelter as a matter of any great moment. Moreover,  what took place could not rightly be termed abduction, for I came with  you of my own volition--and the Flimbotzik recognize individual  responsibility from the very first moment of the psyche's drawing breath  in any material casing.\"    Bridey talked so much like Harkaway's book that Iversen was almost  relieved when, a few hours later, the alien died. Of course the captain  was worried about possible repercussions from the governments of both  Terra and Flimbot, in spite of Bridey's assurances.    And he could not help but feel a pang when the young humanoid expired in  his arms, murmuring, \"Do not grieve for me, soul-mates. In the midst of  life, there is life....\"    \"Funny,\" Smullyan said, with one of his disconcerting returns to a  professional manner, \"all the other forms seemed perfectly healthy. Why  did this one go like that? Almost as if he _wanted_ to die.\"    \"He was too good for this ship, that's what,\" the radio operator said,  glaring at the captain. \"Too fine and brave and--and noble.\"    \"Yes,\" Harkaway agreed. \"What truly sensitive soul could exist in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#5)"],[1,"place in the general appearance and deportment of the  male: His frame becomes more angular and the masculine proportions more  pronounced; increased strength and greater powers of endurance are  manifested; the larynx enlarges and the voice becomes lower in pitch as  well as rougher and more powerful; new feelings and desires awaken in  the mind. His deportment becomes more commanding, his frivolity is less  and less apparent, and the boy is lost in the man. If he has been so  fortunate as to escape all the dangers and baneful influences of  childhood, he is manly indeed, and we behold him with an unburdened  conscience, bright intellect, frank address and good memory. His spirits  are buoyant and his complexion clear; every function of his body is well  performed, and no fatigue is felt after moderate exertion. He evinces  that elasticity of body, and that happy control of himself and his  feelings, which are indicative of the robust health and absence of care  which should accompany youth. His time is devoted to his studies, duties  and amusements; as he feels his stature increase, and his intellect  enlarge, he gladly prepares for his coming struggle with the world.    All boys may come to this condition with proper training through the  period of infancy and childhood; and after arriving at the adolescent  age of their existence as they have the power of mind to _choose_, so  also have they the power to _refuse_. The human race is created above  the animal so that we are something more than mere animals; we are human  beings with human propensities, human passions, human desires and human  tastes, which are subject to the human brain, to the human reason and to  the human will--all elevated and ennobled by the Divine Will. Man must  not let himself down to be governed by animal passions; the moment he  does that, his higher powers suffer and become weakened, and he becomes  more like an inferior animal; if he persists in this downward course,  his lower powers become strengthened until finally they transcend and  rule the higher. Then, to all intents and purposes, such a man's head is  downwards and the lower part of his body is upwards just where his head  ought to be.    Man is a human being, yet, like the whole animal kingdom, he has  appetites, desires and passions, as it is absolutely necessary that he  should have. He has organs corresponding to these appetites, desires and  passions, and it is necessary that he should have them. A proper  understanding in regard to this matter will convince anyone of the truth  of this assertion. Our Creator doeth all things wisely and well, in the  most perfect manner possible. Consequently, man with all his organs,  parts and passions is just what he should be when he blossoms into  youth, in the perfection of his adolescence as described above. In fact  there could be no other form of creating man, for the Lord always  creates in the most perfect way possible, according to one harmonious  law which He has ordained to govern the creation of all beings.    Such a man is fully prepared to struggle with himself and the world at  large. In his desires, appetites or passions of any kind, he, in his  humanity, protected by his rational faculties and enlightened by the  Divine Oracle of God, unquestionably has the power to choose between  propriety and impropriety, between the right and the wrong, between the  good and the bad. Take any evil into which a member of the human family  may fall--the love of ardent spirit for instance; he first thinks of it  and desires to partake of some. Finally he takes an opportunity to  gratify his desire, does satisfy it for the time and thinks it very  nice. The next craving is a little more intense, and he cannot overcome  the temptation quite so easily as he could have done before, and at last  he indulges again. So he goes on, step by step, until he may fall very  low. _The same thinking, feeling and desiring precedes the adoption of  every vicious habit that was ever formed._ Nor will anyone pretend to  say that a persistent effort of the will power, at the very outset, when  he first perceived the tendencies of his desires to do what he need not  do, would not have prevented the evil; no argumentation will prevail in  the face of stubborn facts, and the real facts are all on the side of  purity and order.    These very young men or youths, as they progress through adolescence,  may become tempted in a variety of ways, some to the use of ardent  spirits or tobacco, others to lie, to steal, to forge, &c.; but the  approach to all these evils is gradual and first comes through the mind.  They first think about the action, turn it over and over in their minds  until they come to greatly desire and then, later, to commit the evil  which would not have been ultimated if the mind had been persistently  set against it in the beginning. This is an indisputable fact.    In this manner many promising youths, just as they are blossoming into  the pride of early manhood, begin to indulge in sexual thoughts and to  allow these thoughts to influence their minds until they commit some of  the evils to which perverted and unchaste passions lead them. If this  evil be masturbation, then they are on the direct road to ruin, as will  be seen described further on. If it be the commission of sexual  intercourse with women, their ruin is still more certain, and in the  latter case they are exposed to one of the worst poisons that can  possibly infect the human race. I do not overdraw the picture when I  declare that _millions of human beings die annually from the effects of  poison contracted in this way_, in some form of suffering or another;  for, by insinuating its effects into and poisoning the whole man, it  complicates various disorders and renders them incurable. When  gonorrhoea is contracted, although frequently suppressed by local  treatment in the form of injections, it is never perfectly cured  thereby. No; the hidden poison runs on for a life time producing  strictures, dysuria, gleet and kindred diseases; finally, in old men, a  horrible prostatitis results from which the balance of one's life is  rendered miserable indeed. If inflammation of the lungs supervenes,  there is often a translation of the virus to these vital organs, causing  what is termed \"plastic pneumonia,\" where one lobule after another  becomes gradually sealed up, till nearly the whole of both lungs becomes  impervious to air, and death results from asphyxia.    This horrible infection sometimes becomes engrafted upon other acute  diseases when lingering disorders follow, causing years of misery, and  only terminating in death.    If real syphilis, in the form of chancre, should be contracted, and in  that form suppressed, we have buboes often of a malignant type,  ulceration of the penis and a loss of some portion of this member.  Sometimes the poison attacks the throat, causing most destructive  ulcerations therein; sometimes it seizes upon the nasal bones, resulting  in their entire destruction and an awful disfiguration of the face;  sometimes it ultimates itself in the ulceration and destruction of other  osseous tissues in different portions of the body. Living examples of  these facts are too frequently witnessed in the streets of any large  city. Young men marrying with the slightest taint of this poison in the  blood will surely transmit the disease to their children. Thousands of  abortions transpire every year from this cause alone, the poison being  so destructive as to kill the child _in utero_, before it is matured for  birth; and even if the child be born alive, it is liable to break down  with the most loathsome disorders of some kind and to die during  dentition; the few that survive this period are short lived and are  unhealthy so long as they do live. The very first unchaste connection of  a man with a woman may be attended with a contamination entailing upon  him a life of suffering and even death itself. There is no safety among  impure or loose women whether in private homes or in the very best  regulated houses of ill-fame; even in Paris, where, after women have  been carefully examined and pronounced free from any infecting  condition, the first man who visits one of them, often carries away a  deadly enemy in his blood, which had lurked in concealment beyond the  keen eye of the inspector. A young man, or a man at any age, is in far  greater danger amidst company of this stamp, than he would be with a  clear conscience and pure character in the midst of the wildest forest,  full of all manner of poisonous serpents and wild beasts of every  description. A knowledge of the above facts should be enough to chill  the first impulse and to make any man who respects his own well-being,  turn away and flee from the destruction that awaits him.    As if the above sufferings were not a sufficient penalty for the  transgression against the law--\"Be ye pure,\" we find yet another.  Coincident with the physical wreck, which syphilis makes of the man who  becomes thoroughly tainted with its poison, comes his moral wreck. He  loses all respect for the truth and all regard for his word; no  dependence of any kind can be placed upon him, and he will not pay his  debts or fulfil any moral obligation; all because he began by  prostituting his mind more and more until, with deadened conscience,  almost literally, his head is dependent and his feet uppermost, ruling  all the better part of his nature. And next come the mental  sufferings--and most agonizing they are. Unhappy to the last degree, he  no longer takes pleasure in life, but, wishing to die, finally commits  suicide. A search in any insane asylum will show that a very large  proportion of patients are made up from those who masturbate or have  syphilis. Stamp out these two evils, or rather _curses_ of the human  race, and the supply that feeds our insane asylums, aye and our  penitentiaries, too,"]]]
