Our alderman  fled from Cupid, clams, and his beloved Gotham, and sought health and  buffalo on the plains of Kansas. As he remarked to us pathetically: \"A  good liver makes a good husband. Indigestion frightens connubial bliss  out of the window. Pills, my boy, pills is the quietus of love. If you  wish Cupid to leave, give him a dose of 'em. The liver, instead of the  heart, is at the bottom of half the suicides.\"    Doctor Pythagoras in years was fifty, and in stature short. His  favorite theory was \"development,\" and this he carried to depths which  would have astonished Darwin himself. How humble he used to make us feel  by digging at the roots of the family tree until its uttermost fiber lay  between an oyster and a sponge! (Rumor charged him with waiting so long  for diseases to develop, that his patients developed into spirits.)  While he indorsed Darwin, however, he also admired Pythagoras. The  latter's doctrine of metempsychosis he Darwinized. In their  transmigration from one body to another, souls developed, taking a  higher order of being with each change, until finally fitted to enter  the land of spirits. The soul of a jack-of-all-trades was one which  developed slowly, and picked up a new craft with each new body. Like  Pythagoras, he remembered several previous bodies which his soul had  animated, among others that of the original Rarey, who existed in Egypt  some centuries before the modern usurper was born. If souls proved  entirely unworthy during the probationary or human period, they were  cast back into the brute creation to try it over again. To this class  belonged prize-fighters, Congressmen, and the like. With them the past  was a blank--an unsuccessful problem washed from the slate. The doctor  had a hobby that a vicious horse was only a vicious man entered into a  lower order of being. To demonstrate this he had traveled, and still  persisted in traveling, on eccentric horses, for the purpose of  reasoning with them. But his Egyptian lore had been lost in  transmission, and his falls, kicks, and bites became as many as the  moons which had passed over his head.    [Illustration: COLON AND SEMI-COLON.]    [Illustration: DAVID PYTHAGORAS, M. D.]    Genuine Muggs was an Englishman. The antipodes of Tammany Sachem, who  would not believe any thing, Muggs swallowed every thing. He had already  absorbed so much in this way that he knew all about the United States  before visiting it. Given half a chance, he would undoubtedly have told  the savage more about the latter's habits than the aborigine himself  knew. It was positively impossible for him to learn any thing. His round  British body was so full of indisputable facts that another one would  have burst it. In the Presidential alphabet, from Alpha Washington to  Omega Grant, he knew all of our rulers' tricks and trades, and  understood better the crooked ways of the White House than our own  talented Jenkins.    British phlegm incased his soul, and British leather his feet. From heel  to crown he was completely a Briton. His mutton-chop whiskers came just  so far, and the h's dropped in and out of his utterings in a perfectly  natural way. In the Briton's alphabet, Sachem used to remark, the _I_ is  so big that it is no wonder the _H_ is often crowded out.    Muggs was a fair representative of the average Englishman who has  traveled somewhat. The eye-teeth of these persons are generally cut with  a slash, and they are forever after sore-mouthed. For a maiden effort  they never suck knowledge gently in, but attempt a gulp which strangles.  The consequence of this hasty acquiring is a bloated condition. The  partly-traveled Briton seems, at first acquaintance, full and swollen  with knowledge; but should the student of learning apply the prick, the  result obtained will generally prove to be--gas.    Over our great country, some of the family of Muggs meet one at every  turn. Often they scurry along solitarily, but occasionally in groups. In  the former case they are unsocial to every body--in the latter to every  body except their own party. The bliss which comes from ignorance must  be of a thoroughly enjoyable nature, for the Muggses certainly do enjoy  themselves. They will pass through a country, remaining completely  uncommunicative and self-wrapped, and know less of it after six months'  traveling than an American in two. The professor says he has met them in  the lonely parks of the Rocky Mountains and in the fishing and hunting  solitudes of the Canadas. If they have been an unusually long time  without seeing a human being, they may possibly catch at an eye-glass  and fling themselves abruptly into a few remarks. But it is in a tone  which says, plainer than words, \"No use in your going any further, man;  I have absorbed all the beauties and knowledge of this locality.\"    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION BUFFALO_    ONE OF THE MUGGSES.]    It is a rare treat to see a coach delivered of Muggs at a country inn.  \"Hi, porter, look hout for my luggage, you know. Tell the publican some  chops, rare, and lively now, and a mug of hale, and, if I can 'ave it, a  room to myself.\" If the latter request is granted, and you are  inquisitive enough to take a peep, you may see Muggs sturdily surveying  himself in the glass, and giving certain satisfied pats to his cravat  and waistcoat, as if to satisfy them that they covered a Briton. Could  the mirror which reflects his face also reflect his thoughts, they  would read about as follows: \"Muggs, you are a Briton, and this hotel  must be made aware of the fact. Whatever you do, be guilty of no  un-English act while in this outlandish land. Your skin is now full of  knowledge, and let not other travelers, like so many mosquitoes, suck it  from you. Your forefathers blessed their eyes and dropped their h's, and  so must you.\" And perhaps by this time, if the chops have arrived, he  dines in seclusion and, by so doing, loses a fund of information which  his fellow-travelers have obtained by common exchange.    Again on the way, Muggs nestles in a corner of the coach and acts  strictly on the defensive, indignantly withdrawing his square-toed,  thick-soled English shoes, should neighboring feet attempt to hobnob  with them. On a trip through Buffalo Land, however, it is difficult for  one of her Britannic Majesty's subjects to maintain the national  dignity. But this fact Genuine Muggs--our Muggs--evidently did not know.  Had he known it, he would never have gone with us in the world.    Another of our party rejoiced in the appellation of \"Colon.\" He obtained  this title because his eccentric specialities of character several times  came very near putting if not a full stop, at least the next thing to  it, upon the particular page of history which our party was making.  Longitudinally, Mr. Colon was all of five feet eleven; in circumference,  perhaps a score or so of inches. He possessed a fair share of oddities,  and what is better an equally fair one of dollars. The hemispheres of  his philanthropic brain seemed equally pre-empted by philosophy and  bugs. Engaging in some immense work for the amelioration of mankind, he  would pursue it with ardor, dwell upon it with unction, and then  suddenly leave it, half finished, to capture a rare spider. Philosophy  and Entomology had constant combat for Colon, and victory tarried with  neither long enough for the seat of war to be cultivated and blossom  with any luxuriance. At the time he joined our party one of his grandest  charitable projects had lately died in a very early period of infancy,  entirely supplanted in his affections for the time being by the prospect  of a chase after Brazilian insects. During our journey it was no  uncommon thing for us to see his thin form all covered with bugs and  reptiles, which had crawled out of the collecting boxes carried in his  pockets. If this meets our friend's eye, let him bear no malice, but  reflect, in the language of his own invariable answer to our  remonstrances, \"It can't be helped.\" Should the public parade of his  faults be disagreeable, he can suffer no more from them now than we did  in the past, and may perhaps call them into closer quarters for the  future.    Mr. Colon's son, of two years less than a score, we dubbed Semi-colon,  as being a smaller edition, or to be exact, precisely one-half of what  the senior Colon was. So perfect was the concord of the two that the  junior had fallen into a chronic and to us amusing habit of answering  \"Ditto\" to the senior's expressions of opinion. Divide the father's  conversation by two, add an assent to every thing, and the result,  socially considered, would be the son. It may readily be seen,  therefore, why the professor for short should call him, as he nearly  always did, \"Semi.\"    Shamus Dobeen, our cook and body-servant, according to his own account,  was the child of an impoverished but noble Irish family. Indeed, we  doubt if any Irishman was ever promoted from shovel laborer to  body-servant without suddenly remembering that he was \"descinded\" from a  line of kings. At the time Shamus was added to the population of  Ireland, the patrimonial estate had dwindled down to a peat bog. As this  soon \"petered out,\" Shamus went from the exhausted moor into the cold  world. He had been by turns expelled patriot, dirt disturber on new  railroads, gunner on a Confederate cruiser, and high private in a Union  regiment. The position of gunner he lost by touching off a piece before  the muzzle had been run out, in consequence of which part of the  vessel's side went off suddenly with the gun. Captured, he readily  became a Union soldier, and could, without doubt, have transformed  himself into a Cheyenne, or a Patagonian, had occasion for either ever  required.    While in Topeka, our party made the acquaintance of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#5)"],[1,"sent him a bat instead of a woman.    A delightful walk by shady lanes and cornfields, and along the banks of  the river Lark, leads to another fine old house, Wamil Hall, a portion  only of the original structure; but it would be difficult to find a more  pleasing picture than is formed by the remaining wing. It is a typical  manor-house, with ball-surmounted gables, massive mullioned windows, and  a fine Elizabethan gateway in the lofty garden wall, partly ivy-grown,  and with the delicate greys and greens of lichens upon the old stone  masonry.    In a south-easterly direction from Mildenhall there is charming open  heathy country nearly all the way to West Stow Hall, some seven or eight  miles away. The remains of this curious old structure consist  principally of the gatehouse, octagonal red-brick towers surmounted by  ornamental cupolas with a pinnacled step-gable in the centre and the  arms of Mary of France beneath it, and ornamental Tudor brickwork above  the entrance. The passage leading from this entrance to the main  structure consists of an open arcade, and the upper portion and  adjoining wing are of half-timber construction. This until recently has  been cased over in plaster; but the towers having become unsafe, some  restorations have been absolutely necessary, the result of which is that  the plaster is being stripped off, revealing the worn red-brick and  carved oak beams beneath. Moreover, the moat, long since filled up, is  to be reinstated, and, thanks to the noble owner, Lord Cadogan, all its  original features will be most carefully brought to light. In a room  above are some black outline fresco paintings of figures in Elizabethan  costume, suggestive of four of the seven ages of man. Most conspicuous  is the lover paying very marked attentions to a damsel who may or may  not represent Henry VIII.'s sister at the time of her courtship by the  valiant Brandon, Duke of Suffolk; anyway the house was built by Sir John  Crofts, who belonged to the queen-dowager's household, and he may have  wished to immortalise that romantic attachment. A gentleman with a  parrot-like hawk upon his wrist says by an inscription, \"Thus do I all  the day\"; while the lover observes, \"Thus do I while I may.\" A third  person, presumably getting on in years, says with a sigh, \"Thus did I  while I might\"; and he of the \"slippered pantaloon\" age groans, \"Good  Lord, will this world last for ever!\" In a room adjoining, we were told,  Queen Elizabeth slept during one of her progresses through the country,  or maybe it was Mary Tudor who came to see Sir John; but the \"White  Lady\" who issues from one of the rooms in the main building at 12  o'clock p.m. so far has not been identified.    In his lordship's stables close by we had the privilege of seeing \"a  racer\" who had won sixteen or more \"seconds,\" as well as a budding Derby  winner of the future. Culford is a stately house in a very trim and  well-cared-for park. It looks quite modern, but the older mansion has  been incorporated with it. In Charles II.'s day his Majesty paid  occasional visits to Culford _en route_ from Euston Hall to Newmarket,  and Pepys records an incident there which was little to his host's  (Lord Cornwallis') credit. The rector's daughter, a pretty girl, was  introduced to the king, whose unwelcome attentions caused her to make a  precipitate escape, and, leaping from some height, she killed herself,  \"which, if true,\" says Pepys, \"is very sad.\" Certainly Charles does not  show to advantage in Suffolk. The Diarist himself saw him at Little  Saxham Hall[7] (to the south-west of Culford), the seat of Lord Crofts,  going to bed, after a heavy drinking bout with his boon companions  Sedley, Buckhurst, and Bab May.    The church is in the main modern, but there is a fine tomb of Lady  Bacon, who is represented life-size nursing her youngest child, while on  either side in formal array stand her other five children. Her husband  is reclining full length at her feet.    Hengrave Hall, one of the finest Tudor mansions in England, is close to  Culford. Shorn of its ancient furniture and pictures (for, alas! a few  years ago there was a great sale here), the house is still of  considerable interest; but the absence of colour--its staring whiteness  and bare appearance--on the whole is disappointing, and compared with  less architecturally fine houses, such as Kentwell or Rushbrooke, it is  inferior from a picturesque point of view. Still the outline of gables  and turreted chimneys is exceptionally fine and stately. It was built  between the years 1525 and 1538. The gatehouse has remarkable  mitre-headed turrets, and a triple bay-window bearing the royal arms of  France and England quarterly, supported by a lion and a dragon. The  entrance is flanked on either side by an ornamental pillar similar in  character to the turrets. The house was formerly moated and had a  drawbridge, as at Helmingham in this county. These were done away with  towards the end of the eighteenth century, when a great part of the  original building was demolished and the interior entirely  reconstructed. The rooms included the \"Queen's Chamber,\" where Elizabeth  slept when she was entertained here after the lavish style at Kenilworth  in 1578, by Sir Thomas Kytson. From the Kitsons, Hengrave came to the  Darcys and Gages.    In the vicinity of Bury there are many fine old houses, but for  historical interest none so interesting as Rushbrooke Hall, which stands  about the same distance from the town as Hengrave in the opposite  direction, namely, to the south-west. It is an Elizabethan house, with  corner octagonal turrets to which many alterations were made in the next  century: the windows, porch, etc., being of Jacobean architecture. It is  moated, with an array of old stone piers in front, upon which the  silvery green lichen stands out in harmonious contrast with the rich  purple red of the Tudor brickwork. The old mansion is full of Stuart  memories. Here lived the old cavalier Henry Jermyn, Earl of St. Albans,  who owed his advancement to Queen Henrietta Maria, to whom he acted as  secretary during the Civil War, and to whom he was privately married  when she became a widow and lived in Paris. He was a handsome man, as  may be judged from his full-length portrait here by Vandyck, though he  is said to have been somewhat ungainly. In the \"State drawing-room,\"  where the maiden queen held Court when she visited the earl's ancestor  Sir Robert Jermyn in 1578, may be seen two fine inlaid cabinets of wood  set with silver, bearing the monogram of Henrietta Maria. Jermyn  survived his royal wife the dowager-queen over fourteen years. Evelyn  saw him a few months before he died. \"Met My Lord St. Albans,\" he says,  \"now grown so blind that he could not see to take his meat. He has lived  a most easy life, in plenty even abroad, whilst His Majesty was a  sufferer; he has lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty  years old, he continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots  on the cards. He eat and drank with extraordinary appetite. He is a  prudent old courtier, and much enriched since His Majesty's return.\"[8]    Charles I.'s leather-covered travelling trunk is also preserved at  Rushbrooke as well as his night-cap and night-shirt, and the silk  brocade costume of his great-grandson, Prince Charles Edward. An emblem  of loyalty to the Stuarts also may be seen in the great hall, a  bas-relief in plaster representing Charles II. concealed in the Boscobel  oak. Many of the bedrooms remain such as they were two hundred years  ago, with their fine old tapestries, faded window curtains, and tall  canopied beds. One is known as \"Heaven\" and another as \"Hell,\" from the  rich paintings upon the walls and ceilings. The royal bedchamber,  Elizabeth's room, contains the old bed in which she slept, with its  velvet curtains and elaborately worked counter-pane. The house is rich  in portraits, and the walls of the staircase are lined from floor to  ceiling with well-known characters of the seventeenth century, from  James I. to Charles II.'s confidant, Edward Progers, who died in 1714,  at the age of ninety-six, of the anguish of cutting four new teeth.[9]  Here also is Agnes de Rushbrooke, who haunts the Hall. There is a grim  story told of her body being cast into the moat; moreover, there is a  certain bloodstain pointed out to verify the tale.    Then there is the old ballroom, and the Roman Catholic chapel, now a  billiard-room, and the library, rich in ancient manuscripts and  elaborate carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The old gardens also are quite  in character with the house, with its avenues of hornbeams known as  Lovers' Walk, and the site of the old labyrinth or maze.    Leaving Rushbrooke with its Stuart memories, our way lies to the  south-east; but to the south-west there are also many places of  interest, such as Hardwick, Hawstead, Plumpton, etc. At the last-named  place, in an old house with high Mansard roofs resembling a French  chateau, lived an eccentric character of whom many anecdotes are told,  old Alderman Harmer, one of which is that in damp weather he used to sit  in a kind of pulpit in one of the topmost rooms, with wooden boots on!    For the remains of Hawstead Place, once visited in State by Queen  Elizabeth, who dropped her fan in the moat to test the gallantry of her  host, we searched in vain. A very old woman in mob-cap in pointing out  the farm so named observed, \"T'were nowt of much account nowadays, tho'  wonderful things went on there years gone by.\" This was somewhat vague.  We went up to the house and asked if an old gateway of which we had  heard still existed. The servant girl looked aghast. Had we asked the  road to Birmingham she could scarcely have been more dumbfounded. \"No,  there was no old gateway there,\" she said. We asked another villager,  but he shook his head. \"There was a lady in the church who died from a  box "]]]
