I gave Mahomet some little advice upon this point, reminding him  that, although the clothes of the party were only worth a few  piastres, the spoons and forks were silver; therefore I should hold  him responsible for the honesty of his friend. This reflection upon the  family gave great offence, and he assured me that Achmet, our quondam  acquaintance, was so near a relative that he was--I assisted him in the  genealogical distinction: \"Mother's brother's cousin's sister's mother's  son? Eh, Mahomet?\"    \"Yes, sar, that's it!\" \"Very well, Mahomet; mind he doesn't steal the  spoons, and thrash him if he doesn't do his work!\" \"Yes, sar\", replied  Mahomet; \"he all same like one brother; he one good man; will do  his business quietly; if not, master lick him.\" The new relative not  understanding English, was perfectly satisfied with the success of his  introduction, and from that moment he became one of the party.    One more addition, and our arrangements were completed: the Governor of  Cassala was determined we should not start without a soldier guide to  represent the government. Accordingly he gave us a black corporal, so  renowned as a sportsman that he went by the name of \"El Baggar\" (the  cow), because of his having killed several of the oryx antelope, known  as \"El Baggar et Wabash\" (cow of the desert).    After sixteen hours' actual marching from Cassala we arrived at  the valley of the Atbara. There was an extraordinary change in the  appearance of the river between Gozerajup and this spot. There was no  longer the vast sandy desert with the river flowing through its sterile  course on a level with the surface of the country; but after traversing  an apparently perfect flat of forty-five miles of rich alluvial soil,  we had suddenly arrived upon the edge of a deep valley, between five and  six miles wide, at the bottom of which, about two hundred feet below the  general level of the country, flowed the river Atbara. On the opposite  side of the valley the same vast table-lands continued to the western  horizon.    We commenced the descent toward the river: the valley was a succession  of gullies and ravines, of landslips and watercourses. The entire  hollow, of miles in width, had evidently been the work of the river. How  many ages had the rains and the stream been at work to scoop out from  the flat tableland this deep and broad valley? Here was the giant  laborer that had shovelled the rich loam upon the delta of Lower Egypt!  Upon these vast flats of fertile soil there can be no drainage except  through soakage. The deep valley is therefore the receptacle not only  for the water that oozes from its sides, but subterranean channels,  bursting as land-springs from all parts of the walls of the valley, wash  down the more soluble portions of earth, and continually waste away the  soil. Landslips occur daily during the rainy season; streams of rich  mud pour down the valley's slopes, and as the river flows beneath in  a swollen torrent, the friable banks topple down into the stream and  dissolve. The Atbara becomes the thickness of peasoup, as its muddy  waters steadily perform the duty they have fulfilled from age to age.  Thus was the great river at work upon our arrival on its bank at the  bottom of the valley. The Arab name, \"Bahr el Aswat\" (black river) was  well bestowed; it was the black mother of Egypt, still carrying to her  offspring the nourishment that had first formed the Delta.    At this point of interest the journey had commenced; the deserts were  passed; all was fertility and life. Wherever the sources of the  Nile might be, the Atbara was the parent of Egypt! This was my first  impression, to be proved hereafter.    A violent thunderstorm, with a deluge of rain, broke upon our camp on  the banks of the Atbara, fortunately just after the tents were pitched.  We thus had an example of the extraordinary effects of the heavy rain in  tearing away the soil of the valley. Trifling watercourses were swollen  to torrents. Banks of earth became loosened and fell in, and the rush  of mud and water upon all sides swept forward into the river with a  rapidity which threatened the destruction of the country, could such a  tempest endure for a few days. In a couple of hours all was over.    In the evening we crossed with our baggage and people to the opposite  side of the ricer, and pitched our tents at the village of Goorashee.  In the morning the camels arrived, and once more we were ready to start.  Our factotum, El Baggar, had collected a number of baggage-camels  and riding dromedaries, or \"hygeens\". The latter he had brought for  approval, as we bad suffered much from the extreme roughness of our  late camels. There is the same difference between a good hygeen, or  dromedary, and a baggage-camel, as between the thoroughbred and the  cart-horse; and it appears absurd in the eyes of the Arabs that a man  of any position should ride a baggage-camel. Apart from all ideas of  etiquette, the motion of the latter animal is quite sufficient warning.  Of all species of fatigue, the back-breaking, monotonous swing of  a heavy camel is the worst; and should the rider lose patience and  administer a sharp cut with the coorbatch, that induces the creature  to break into a trot, the torture of the rack is a pleasant tickling  compared to the sensation of having your spine driven by a sledge-hammer  from below, half a foot deeper into the skull.    The human frame may be inured to almost anything; thus the Arabs, who  have always been accustomed to this kind of exercise, hardly feel the  motion, and the portion of the body most subject to pain in riding a  rough camel upon two bare pieces of wood for a saddle, becomes naturally  adapted for such rough service, as monkeys become hardened from  constantly sitting upon rough substances. The children commence almost  as soon as they are born, as they must accompany their mothers in their  annual migrations; and no sooner can the young Arab sit astride and hold  on than he is placed behind his father's saddle, to which he clings,  while he bumps upon the bare back of the jolting camel. Nature quickly  arranges a horny protection to the nerves, by the thickening of the  skin; thus, an Arab's opinion of the action of a riding hygeen should  never be accepted without a personal trial. What appears delightful to  him may be torture to you, as a strong breeze and a rough sea may be  charming to a sailor, but worse than death to a landsman.    I was determined not to accept the camels now offered as hygeens until I  had seen them tried. I accordingly ordered our black soldier, El Baggar,  to saddle the most easy-actioned animal for my wife; but I wished to see  him put it through a variety of paces before she should accept it. The  delighted EL Baggar, who from long practice was as hard as the heel of  a boot, disdained a saddle. The animal knelt, was mounted, and off he  started at full trot, performing a circle of about fifty yards' diameter  as though in a circus. I never saw such an exhibition! \"Warranted  quiet to ride, of easy action, and fit for a lady!\" This had been the  character received with the rampant brute, who now, with head and tail  erect, went tearing round the circle, screaming and roaring like a wild  beast, throwing his forelegs forward and stepping at least three feet  high in his trot.    Where was El Baggar? A disjointed looking black figure was sometimes  on the back of this easy going camel, sometimes a foot high in the air;  arms, head, legs, hands, appeared like a confused mass of dislocation;  the woolly hair of this unearthly individual, that had been carefully  trained in long stiff narrow curls, precisely similar to the tobacco  known as \"negro-head,\" alternately started upright en masse, as though  under the influence of electricity, and then fell as suddenly upon his  shoulders. Had the dark individual been a \"black dose\", he or it  could not have been more thoroughly shaken. This object, so thoroughly  disguised by rapidity of movement, was El Baggar happy, delighted El  Baggar! As he came rapidly round toward us flourishing his coorbatch, I  called to him, \"Is that a nice hygeen for the Sit (lady), EL Baggar?  Is it very easy?\" He was almost incapable of a reply. \"V-e-r-y  e-e-a-a-s-y,\" replied the trustworthy authority, \"j-j-j-just the  thin-n-n-g for the S-i-i-i-t-t-t.\" \"All right, that will do,\" I  answered, and the jockey pulled up his steed. \"Are the other camels  better or worse than that?\" I asked. \"Much worse,\" replied El Baggar;  \"the others are rather rough, but this is an easy goer, and will suit  the lady well.\"    It was impossible to hire a good hygeen; an Arab prizes his riding  animal too much, and invariably refuses to let it to a stranger, but  generally imposes upon him by substituting some lightly-built camel  that he thinks will pass muster. I accordingly chose for my wife a  steady-going animal from among the baggage-camels, trusting to be able  to obtain a hygeen from the great Sheik Abou Sinn, who was encamped upon  the road we were about to take along the valley of the Atbara. We left  Goorashee on the following day.        CHAPTER III.

Everybody appeared in good humor. The  distended udders of thousands of camels were an assurance of plenty. The  burning sun that for nine months had scorched the earth was veiled by  passing clouds. The cattle that had panted for water, and whose food  was withered straw, were filled with juicy fodder. The camels that had  subsisted upon the dried and leafless twigs and branches, now feasted  upon the succulent tops of the mimosas.

It is a most important item  of the crop, and in the rural economy of an Indian village almost as much  is thought of it as the grain itself. Wheat and barley straw makes what is  called \"white bhoosa,\" and gram and the various pulses \"missa bhoosa.\"  Both these can be used as horse food; in fact, on the Afghan frontier they  get nothing else, and many natives feed their animals entirely on it,  never giving them grass; but although they will eat it, and for a time  keep condition, it is not to be recommended. If it has to be used, and it  is possible to obtain any grass, they should be mixed together. A small  quantity of \"bhoosa\" mixed in the feed will make a greedy feeder masticate  it. \"White bhoosa\" looks like badly chopped straw-chaff. \"Missa bhoosa\" is  of a dark colour, the particles not being straight-like sticks, but bent  about, and frequently there are a quantity of the leaves of the plant  mixed with it. Care should be taken that both sorts are not mouldy, which  is very apt to be the case, as the native farmers store it in large  quantities during the winter, and when the new crop comes on, if there is  any of last year's left, it is what they try and sell. Being stacked in  the open, it is exceedingly likely to get damaged by the rain. \"Bhoosa\"  should have a clean, fresh smell like sweet straw, not be discoloured or  have any patches of mould about it, and be free from impurities such as  sticks, thorns, or pieces of mud or stones.      Bamboo Leaves (_bans_).    In Eastern Bengal, Assam, and parts of Burma, the green leaves and young  shoots of the bamboo are used for forage. During the Chin-Lushai  Expedition in 1889-90, the animals with the force got nothing else for  nearly eight months. I had three ponies of my own that were worked  moderately hard the whole time, and they remained in good condition. The  transport mules, which were worked very hard indeed in a very trying  climate, did not fall away nearly as much as I expected. The young shoots  and leaves are cut with a sort of a billhook, called a \"dah,\" and care  must be taken that only the young green leaves and soft tender shoots are  given, the old leaves and the edges of the dry stumps of the bamboo  cutting like a razor. I have seen some bad wounds on the lips, tongue, and  angles of the mouth from this cause. It is best to make the \"syces\" and  \"grass-cutters\" pluck the leaves off the branches altogether, and not  leave them about the stable, for fear of wounding the horses. This they  will readily do, as they use the _debris_ for fuel. I have seen some bad  cuts and injuries in both men and animals from the edges of the split  bamboo, which are very sharp--so much so that the savage tribes on the  eastern frontier use a properly split piece of bamboo for a knife in  skinning animals; and the sap of the green bamboo appears to have a  peculiarly irritating or poisonous action, a wound caused by it festering  and suppurating in both man and beast, whereas one inflicted with a dry  bamboo will heal up healthy. Horses require a larger amount of bamboo  leaves than grass. If an animal is getting 20 lbs. of green \"dhoob\" grass  daily, he will require 30 lbs. of bamboo leaves to keep him in condition.  Although at first horses may refuse them, they take to them kindly after a  little while.      Oat Hay Forage.    In the South African colonies grass hay is almost unknown. The oat is cut  when about half ripe, dried, and given in the straw, in which condition it  is known as forage, and is excellent feeding. It is usually sold in  bundles, wholesale at so much per hundred, and retail at hotels and  livery stables at so many bundles for a shilling. Some years ago, when I  was travelling in the Dutch part of South Africa, in the more  out-of-the-way parts of which there are no hotels, it was the custom to  ask the owner of the farmhouse where you arrived permission to  \"off-saddle\" if you were riding, or \"out-span\" if driving, for the night  or a couple of hours, as the case might be. This was a roundabout way of  asking if he could put you and your animals up for the night. When leaving  in the morning, it would have been a great breach of good manners to ask  for your bill, but you inquired what you were indebted to his head-boy for  the forage your horses had consumed--a polite way of asking for your  account; the number of bundles per shilling varying according to the time  you remained, and the accommodation you had received; but, notwithstanding  this fiction, I did not, as a rule, find the total any less than in a  regular hotel where you get your bill.      Hay.    Hay, as is known in Europe and Australia, is never seen in India. In some  parts, what is called hay can be obtained; but, compared to English meadow  hay, it is at the best but poor stuff. No doubt hay of a very tolerable  quality can be made in India; in fact, I have done so, but usually the  grass is cut after the plant has flowered, the seed ripened and shed, when  it is what is known as \"the sap being down,\" and then it is dry and with  little nourishment in it. It is generally also allowed to lie out too long  after it has been cut in a hot, powerful sun, which utterly bakes it up.  The grass should be cut when the seed is green and the sap well up in it,  and should not be allowed to remain too long drying. I have generally  found that from eight to ten hours of the Indian sun was enough, so that  grass cut in the morning should be stacked at night; it will then not be  utterly dried up, and in the stack will undergo the process of  fermentation that gives the characteristic smell to English hay. There is  a certain amount of difficulty in doing this. The grass flowers and seeds  at the end of the hot weather, about September, when the monsoon rains are  on, and these sometimes last for days together. It is, therefore,  sometimes difficult to get a fine day to cut and save the hay in before  the seed is shed; and before the dry weather again sets in the sap has  gone down, and there is but little nutriment left in the grass. It is not  a bad plan to sprinkle some salt over each layer of hay as the stack is  made up; horses eat this cured hay with great relish. In making up the  stack, a bundle or two of straw, put on end from the bottom upwards,  should be built into the centre of it as it is being raised up, to act as  a chimney or ventilator to carry off the heat while the stack is  fermenting. If this is not done, there is danger of its catching fire; and  even if it should not heat to such a degree, part is likely to get  discoloured--what is termed \"mow-burned.\" This chimney can be made with  bundles of sticks, boards, or even stones; but sick horses will often eat  the straw from the centre of a haystack when they won't look at anything  else, and it sometimes comes in useful, and in any event, is not wasted.  The stack should be built on a foundation of brambles, stones, or a mud  platform--the latter being the best--to raise it and protect it from  damage by the rains, which at times come in a regular flood, and also to  keep out rats, mice, and other vermin. When the stack gets down to the  bottom, care should be exercised in handling it, as it is a great refuge  for snakes, and I have seen one fatal accident from snake bite from this  cause. It, then, is a good plan to make the men remove the hay in small  quantities at a time with a hay-fork, which is easily made by fastening a  couple of short sticks converging from each other on to a long bamboo;  but natives are such fatalists that, no matter how much warned of the  danger they are incurring, they will not take the commonest precautions as  to their safety if it gives them a little extra trouble. A somewhat larger  quantity of dry grass is required than green \"dhoob\" by weight, the  proportion being about 15 to 20 lbs. respectively.      Green Food (_khawid_, or _khasil_).    In the spring of the year in India it is common to give horses green  wheat, oats, or barley. This is cut in the straw from the time it is about  a foot high until the grain begins to ripen, a period that lasts about a  month or six weeks in the Punjab--from the middle of February till the end  of March. This green food is called by the natives \"khawid,\" or \"khasil.\"  It has an excellent effect on the system, and is what is used by the  native dealers to get their horses into condition for sale. Too large a  quantity should not be given at first, as it is likely to cause  diarrhoea; about 4 lbs. daily being sufficient at first, but it may be  increased up to double this amount if it agrees with the animal. Care  should be taken that the green food is only given when young and the straw  tender, for when it gets ripe, and the straw woody and hard, it is very  indigestible, and a common cause of intestinal obstruction and colic. In  some parts green barley is given in the same manner, and when it is young  it is as good as wheat or oats; but when it begins to ripen it should be  stopped, as the awns or beards begin to get hard, and not only are they  likely to choke the horse, but to cause dangerous intestinal obstruction.  Oats can be given much longer than barley or wheat; in fact, as I have  said, ripe oats are cut in the straw, and used as hay in many parts of the  world. The green crop must be purchased standing from a cultivator, and  this is best arranged through your head \"syce.\" It is sold by measurement,  a patch in the field being marked out; or else the grass-cutters go and  cut as much as is required daily, the"]]]
