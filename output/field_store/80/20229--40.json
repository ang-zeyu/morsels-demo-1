The Kilo had swung back to an even keel again, but was still  bobbing about on the water.    \"Any hole there?\" cried Tom, as he swung the wheel over to point  his craft toward shore, in case she showed a tendency to sink.    \"I can't see any hole,\" answered Ned. \"But water is coming in  here.\"    \"Then there's a leak all right! Probably some of the seams are  opened, or it may be coming in around the shaft stuffing-box.  Here, Ned, take the wheel, and I'll start up the engine again,\"  for with the blow the motor had stopped.    \"What are you going to do?\" asked Ned, as he again made his way  forward.    \"Take her to shore, of course. It's deep out here and I don't want  her to go down at this point.\"    \"Say, what do you think of that fellow, anyhow, Tom?\"    \"I wouldn't like to tell you. Look, he's coming back.\"    This was so, for, as the boys watched, the big red motor boat had  swung about in a circle and was headed for them.    \"I'll tell him what I think of him, at any rate,\" murmured Tom, as  he bent over his motor. \"And, later on, I'll let the lawyers talk  to him.\"    \"You mean you'll sue him, Tom?\"    \"Well, I'm certainly not going to let him run into me and spring a  leak, for nothing. That won't go with me!\"    By this time Tom had the motor started, but he throttled it down  so that it just turned the propeller. With it running at full  speed there was considerable vibration, and this would further  open the leaking seams. So much water might thus be let in that  the craft could not be gotten ashore.    \"Head her over, Ned,\" cried Tom, when he found he had sufficient  headway. \"Steer for Ramsey's dock. There's a marine railway next  to him, and I can haul her out for repairs.\"    \"That's the talk, Tom!\" cried his chum.    By this time the big, red motor boat was close beside Tom's craft.    The man at the wheel, a stout-bodied and stout-faced man, with a  complexion nearly the color of his boat, glared at the two young  men.    \"What do you fellows mean?\" called out the man, in deep booming  tones--tones that he tried to make imposing, but which, to the  trained ears of Tom and Ned, sounded only like the enraged bellow  of some bully. \"What do you mean, I say? Getting on my course like  that!\"    Ned could see Tom biting his lips, and clenching his hands to keep  down his temper. But it was too much. To be run into, and then  insulted, was more than Tom could stand.    \"Look here!\" he cried, standing up and facing the red-faced man,  \"I don't know who you are, and I don't care. But I'll tell you one  thing--you'll pay for the damage you did to my boat!\"    \"I'll pay for it? Come, that's pretty good! Ha! Ha!\" laughed the  self-important man. \"Why, I was thinking of making a complaint  against you for crossing my course that way. If I find my boat is  damaged I shall certainly do so anyhow. Have we suffered any  damage, Snuffin?\" and he looked back at a grimy-faced mechinician  who was oiling the big, throbbing motor, which was now running  with the clutch out.    \"No, sir, I don't think we're damaged, sir,\" answered the man,  deferentially.    \"Well, it's a lucky thing for these land-lubbers that we aren't. I  should certainly sue them. The idea of crossing my course the way  they did. Weren't they in the wrong, Snuffin?\"    The man hesitated for a moment, and glanced at Tom and Ned, as  though asking their indulgence.    \"Well, I asked you a question, Snuffin!\" exclaimed the red-faced  man sharply.    \"Yes--yes, sir, they shouldn't have turned the way they did,\"  answered the man, in a low voice.    \"Well, of all the nerve!\" murmured Tom, and stopped his motor.  Then, stepping to the side of his disabled and leaking boat, he  exclaimed:    \"Look here! Either you folks don't know anything about navigation  rules, or you aren't heeding them. I had a perfect right to turn  and go ashore when I did, for I found my engine was out of order,  and I wanted to fix it. I blew the usual signal on the whistle,  showing my intention to turn off my course, and if you had been  listening you would have heard it.\"    \"If you had even been watching you would have seen me shift, and  then, coming on at the speed you did, it was your place to warn me  by a whistle, so that I could keep straight on until you had  passed me.\"    \"But you did not. You kept right on and ran into me, and the only  wonder is that you didn't sink me. Talk about me getting in your  way! Why, you deliberately ran me down after I had given the right  signal. I'll make a complaint against you, that's what I will.\"    If possible the red-faced man got even more rosy than usual. He  fairly puffed up, he was so angry.    \"Listen to that, will you, Snuffin!\" he cried. \"Listen to that! He  says he blew his whistle to tell us he was going to turn in.\"    \"That's what I did!\" said Tom, calmly.    \"Preposterous! Did you hear it, Snuffin?\" puffed the important  man.    \"Yes--yes, I think I did, sir,\" answered the machinist, in a  hesitating voice.    \"You did? What! You mean to tell me you heard their whistle?\"    \"Yes--yes, sir!\"    \"Why--why--er--I--\" the big man puffed and blew, but seemed to  find no words in which to express himself. \"Snuffin, I'll have a  talk with you when we get home,\" he finally said, most significantly.  \"The idea of saying you heard a whistle blown! There was nothing of  the kind! I shall make a complaint against these land-lubbers myself.  Do you know who they are, Snuffin?\"    \"Yes--yes, sir,\" was the answer, as the man glanced at Tom. \"At  least I know one of them, sir.\"    \"Very good. Give me his name. I'll attend to the rest.\"    Tom looked at the big man sharply. He had never seen him before,  as far as he could recall. As for the machinist, the young  inventor had a dim recollection that once the man might have  worked in his shop.    \"Go ahead, Snuffin!\" said the big man, mopping his face with a  large silk handkerchief, which, even at that distance, gave out a  powerful perfume. \"Go ahead, Snuffin, and we will settle this  matter later,\" and, adjusting a large rose in his buttonhole, the  self-important individual took his place on the cushioned seat at  the wheel, while the big red motor boat drew off down the river.    \"Well, of all the nerve!\" gasped Ned. \"Isn't he the limit?\"    \"Never mind,\" spoke Tom, with a little laugh. \"I'm sorry I lost my  temper, and even bothered to answer him. We'll let the lawyers do  the rest of the talking. Take the wheel, Ned.\"    \"But are you going to let him get away like this, Tom? Without  asking him to pay for the damage to your boat, when he was clearly  in the wrong?\"    \"Oh, I'll ask him to pay all right; but I'll do it the proper way.  Now come on. If we stay here chinning much longer the Kilo will go  down. I must find out who he is. I think I know Snuffin--he used  to work for me, I now recall.\"    \"Don't you know who that big man is?\" asked Ned, as he took the  wheel, while Tom again started the motor. The water was now almost  up to the lower rim of the fly wheel.    \"No; who is he?\" asked Tom.    \"Shallock Peters.\"    \"Well, I know as much as I did before,\" laughed Tom. \"That doesn't  tell me anything.\"    \"Why, I thought everybody in the town knew Shallock Peters,\" went  on Ned. \"He tried to do some business with our bank, but was  turned down. I hear he's gone to the other one, though. He's what  we call a get-rich-quick schemer, Tom--a promoter.\"    \"I thought he acted like that sort of a character.\"    \"Well, that's what he is. He's got half a dozen schemes under way,  and he hasn't been in town over a month. I wonder you haven't seen  or heard of him.\"    \"I've been too busy over my photo telephone.\"    \"I suppose so. Well, this fellow Peters struck Shopton about a  month ago. He bought the old Wardell homestead, and began to show  off at once. He's got two autos, and this big motor boat. He  always goes around with a silk hat and a flower in his buttonhole.  A big bluff--that's what he is.\"    \"He acted so to me,\" was Tom's comment. \"Well, he isn't going to  scare me. The idea! Why, he seemed to think we were in the wrong;  whereas he was, and his man knew it, too.\"    \"Yes, but the poor fellow was afraid to say so. I felt sorry for  him.\"    \"So did I,\" added Tom. \"Well, Kilo is out of commission for the  present. Guess we'll have to finish our outing by walking, Ned.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind. But it makes me mad to have a fellow act the  way he did.\"    \"Well, there's no good in getting mad,\" was Tom's smiling  rejoinder. \"We'll take it out of him legally. That's the best way  in the end. But I can't help saying I don't like Mr. Shallock  Peters.\"    \"And I don't either,\" added Ned.            CHAPTER VI    A WARNING      \"There, she's about right now, Ned. Hold her there!\"    \"Aye, aye, Captain Tom!\"    \"Jove, she's leaking like a sieve! We only got her here just in  time!\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Ned.    Tom and his chum had managed to get the Kilo to Ramsey's dock, and  over the ways of the inclined marine railway that led from the  shop on shore down into the river. Then, poling the craft along,  until she was in the \"cradle,\" Ned held her there while Tom went  on shore to wind up the windlass that pulled the car, containing  the boat, up the incline.    \"I'll give you a hand, as soon as I find she sets level,\" called  Ned, from his place in the boat.    \"All right--don't worry. There are good gears on this windlass,  and she works easy,\" replied Tom.    In a short time the boat was out of the water, but, as Tom grimly  remarked, \"the water was not out of her,\" for a stream poured from  the stuffing-box, through which the propeller shaft entered, and  water also ran out through the seams that had been opened by the  collision.    \"Quite a smash, Tom,\" observed the boat repairer, when he had come  out to look over the Kilo. \"How'd it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#5)"],[1,"may she bear, ought but that she learn to  live temperately in easy things, and patiently in uneasy things?  These are they, the children of Zilpah, Gad and Asher: Gad is  abstinence, and Asher is patience. Gad is the sooner born child, and  Asher the latter; for first it needeth that we be attempered in  ourself with discreet abstinence, and after that we bear outward  disease[64] in strength of patience. These are the children that  Zilpah brought forth in sorrow; for in abstinence and patience the  sensuality is punished in the flesh; but that that is sorrow to the  sensuality turneth to much comfort and bliss to the affection. And  therefore it is that, when Gad was born, Leah cried and said:  \"Happily\"[65]; and therefore Gad is cleped in the story \"Happiness,\"  or \"Seeliness.\"[66] And so it is well said that abstinence in the  sensuality is happiness[67] in the affection. For why, ever the less  that the sensuality is delighted in her lust, the more sweetness  feeleth the affection in her love. Also after when Asher was born,  Leah said: \"This shall be for my bliss\";[68] and therefore was Asher  called in the story \"Blessed.\"[69] And so it is well said that  patience in the sensuality is bliss in the affection. For why, ever  the more disease that the sensuality suffereth, the more blessed is  the soul in the affection. And thus by abstinence and patience we  shall not only understand a temperance in meat and drink, and  suffering of outward tribulation, but also [in] all manner of  fleshly, kindly,[70] and worldly delights, and all manner of  disease, bodily and ghostly, within or without, reasonable or  unreasonable, that by any of our five wits torment or delight the  sensuality. On this wise beareth the sensuality fruit in help of  affection, her lady. Much peace and rest is in that soul that  neither is drunken in the lust of the sensuality, nor grutcheth[71]  in the pain thereof. The first of these is gotten by Gad and the  latter by Asher. Here it is to wete that first was Rachel's maiden  put to the husband or the maiden of Leah; and this is the skill why.  For truly, but if the jangling of the imagination, that is to say,  the in-running of vain thoughts, be first refrained, without doubt  the lust of the sensuality may not be attempered. And therefore who  so will abstain him from fleshly and worldly lusts, him behoveth  first seldom or never think any vain thoughts.[72] And also never in  this life may a man perfectly despise the ease of the flesh, and not  dread the disease, but if he have before busily beholden the meeds  and the torments that are to come. But here it is to wete how that,  with these four sons of these two maidens, the city of our  conscience is kept wonderfully from all temptations. For all  temptation either it riseth within by thought, or else without by  some of our five wits. But within shall Dan deem and damn evil  thoughts by sight of pain; and without shall Gad put against[73]  false delights by use of abstinence. Dan waketh[74] within, and Gad  without; and also their other two brethren helpen them full much:  Naphtali maketh peace within with Dan, and Asher biddeth Gad have no  dread of his enemies. Dan feareth the heart with ugsomeness of hell,  and Naphtali cherisheth it with behighting[75] of heavenly bliss.  Also Asher helpeth his brother without, so that, through them both,  the wall of the city is not broken. Gad holdeth out ease, and Asher  pursueth disease. Asher soon deceiveth his enemy, when he bringeth  to mind the patience of his father[76] and the behighting of  Naphtali, and thus oft times ever the more enemies he hath, the more  matter he hath of overcoming. And therefore it is that, when he hath  overcome his enemies (that is to say, the adversities of this  world), soon he turneth him to his brother Gad to help to destroy  his enemies. And without fail, from that he be come, soon they turn  the back, and flee. The enemies of Gad are fleshly delights; but  truly, from the time that a man have patience in the pain of his  abstinence, false delights find no woning stead[77] in him.          CAPITULUM VII    HOW JOY OF INWARD SWEETNESS RISETH IN THE AFFECTION      THUS when the enemy fleeth and the city is peased,[78] then  beginneth a man to prove what the high peace of God is that passeth  man's wit. And therefore it is that Leah left bearing of children  unto this time that Gad and Asher were born of Zilpah, her maiden.  For truly, but if it be so that a man have refrained the lust and  the pain of his five wits in his sensuality by abstinence and  patience, he shall never feel inward sweetness and true joy in God  and ghostly things in the affection. This is that Issachar, the  fifth son of Leah, the which in the story is cleped \"Meed.\"[79] [And  well is this joy of inward sweetness cleped \"meed\"];[80] for this  joy is the taste of heavenly bliss, the which is the endless meed of  a devout soul, beginning here. Leah, in the birth of this child,  said: \"God hath given me meed, for that I have given my maiden to my  husband in bearing of children.\"[81] And so it is good that we make  our sensuality bear fruit in abstaining it from all manner of  fleshly, kindly, and worldly delight, and in fruitful suffering of  all fleshly and worldly disease; therefore our Lord of His great  mercy giveth us joy unspeakable and inward sweetness in our  affection, in earnest[82] of the sovereign joy and meed of the  kingdom of heaven. Jacob said of Issachar that he was \"a strong ass  dwelling between the terms.\"[83] And so it is that a man in this  state, and that feeleth the earnest of everlasting joy in his  affection, is as \"an ass, strong and dwelling between the terms\";  because that, be he never so filled in soul of ghostly gladness and  joy in God, yet, for corruption of the flesh in this deadly life,  him behoveth bear the charge of the deadly body, as hunger, thirst,  and cold, sleep, and many other diseases; for the which he is  likened to an ass as in body; but as in soul he is strong for to  destroy all the passions and the lusts of the flesh by patience and  abstinence in the sensuality, and by abundance of ghostly joy and  sweetness in the affection. And also a soul in this state is  dwelling between the terms of deadly life and undeadly life. He that  dwelleth between the terms hath nearhand forsaken deadliness, but  not fully, and hath nearhand gotten undeadliness, but not fully; for  whiles that him needeth the goods of this world, as meat and drink  and clothing, as it falleth to each man that liveth, yet his one  foot is in this deadly life; and for great abundance of ghostly joy  and sweetness that he feeleth in God, not seldom but oft, he hath  his other foot in the undeadly life. Thus I trow that saint Paul  felt, when he said this word of great desire: \"Who shall deliver me  from this deadly body?\"[84] And when he said thus: \"I covet to be  loosed and to be with Christ.\"[85] And thus doth the soul that  feeleth Issachar in his affection, that is to say, the joy of inward  sweetness, the which is understanden by Issachar. It enforceth it to  forsake this wretched life, but it may not; it coveteth to enter the  blessed life, but it may not; it doth that it may, and yet it  dwelleth between the terms.          CAPITULUM VIII    HOW PERFECT HATRED OF SIN RISETH IN THE AFFECTION      AND therefore it is that after Issachar Zebulun is born, that is to  say, hatred of sin. And here it is to wete why that hatred of sin is  never perfectly felt in a man's affection, ere the time that ghostly  joy of inward sweetness be felt in the affection, and this is the  skill: for ere this time was never the true cause of hatred felt in  the affection. For the feeling of ghostly joy teacheth a man what  sin harmeth the soul. And all after that the harm in the soul is  felt much or little, thereafter is the hatred measured, more or  less, unto the harming. But when a soul, by the grace of God and  long travail, is come to feeling of ghostly joy in God, then it  feeleth that sin hath been the cause of the delaying thereof. And  also when he feeleth that he may not alway last in the feeling of  that ghostly joy, for the corruption of the flesh, of the which  corruption sin is the cause; then he riseth with a strong feeling of  hatred against all sin and all kind of sin. This feeling taught  David us to have, where he saith in the psalm: \"Be ye wroth and will  ye not sin\";[86] that is thus to mean: Be ye wroth with the sin, but  not with the kind.[87] For kind stirreth to the deed, but not to  sin. And here it is to wete that this wrath and this hatred is not  contrary to charity, but charity teacheth how it shall be had both  in a man's self and in his even Christian;[88] for a man should  [not] hate sin [so that he destroy his kind, but so that he destroy  the sin and the appetite of sin] in his kind. And, as against our  even Christian, we ought to hate sin in him, and to love him; and of  this hatred speaketh David in the psalm, where he saith thus: \"With  perfect hatred I hated them.\"[89] And in another psalm he saith that  \"he had in hatred all wicked ways.\"[90] Thus it is well proved that,  ere Zebulun was born, Judah and Issachar were both born. For but if  a man have had charity and ghostly joy in his feeling first, he may  in no wise feel this perfect hatred of sin in his affection. For  Judah, that is to say, charity, teacheth us how we shall hate sin in  ourself and in our brethren; and Issachar, that is to say, ghostly  feeling of joy in God, teacheth us why we shall hate sin in ourself  and in our brethren. Judah biddeth us hate sin and love the kind;  and Issachar biddeth us destroy the sin and save the kind; and thus  it falleth for to be that the kind may be made strong in God and in  ghostly things by perfect hatred and destroying of sin. And  therefore is Zebulun cleped in the story \"a dwelling stead of  strength.\"[91] And Leah said in his birth: "]]]
