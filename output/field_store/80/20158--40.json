[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],[0,"Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Pet√©n, Guatemala (#5)"],[1," March 2, March 11, and June 27. At these times the toads were  congregated at temporary ponds in the forest or along small sluggish  streams. Throughout the duration of both visits to Chinaja individual  males called almost nightly at the permanent pond at the camp.    The variation in snout-vent length of 20 males selected at random is  56.7 to 72.5 mm. (average, 64.8 mm.). Two adult females have snout-vent  lengths of 80.4 and 87.6 mm. In all specimens the parotid glands are  somewhat elongated and not rounded as in _Bufo valliceps wilsoni_ (see  Baylor and Stuart, 1961:199). My observations on the condition of the  cranial crests of the toads in El Peten agree with the findings of  Baylor and Stuart (_op. cit._:198) in that hypertrophied crests are  usual in large females. In the shape of the parotids and nature of the  cranial crests the specimens from El Peten are like those from the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico. As I pointed out (1960:53), the  validity of the subspecies _Bufo valliceps macrocristatus_, described  from northern Chiapas by Firschein and Smith (1957:219) and supposedly  characterized by hypertrophied cranial crests, is highly doubtful.    In the toads from El Peten the greatest variation is in coloration. The  dorsal ground-color varies from orange and rusty tan to brown, yellowish  tan, and pale gray. In some individuals the flanks and dorsum are one  continuous color, whereas in others a distinct dorsolateral pale colored  band separates the dorsal color from dark brown flanks. In some  individuals the venter is uniform cream color, in others it bears a few  scattered black spots, and in still others there are many spots, some of  which are fused to form a black blotch on the chest. In breeding males  the vocal sac is orange tan. All specimens have a coppery red iris.    Aside from the breeding congregations, active toads were found on the  forest floor at night; a few were there by day. Some individuals were  beneath logs during the day.      =Eleutherodactylus rostralis= (Werner)          Chinaja, 10.    Because of the multiplicity of names and the variation in coloration,  the small terrestrial _Eleutherodactylus_ in southern Mexico and  northern Central America are in a state of taxonomic confusion. Stuart  (1934:7, 1935:37, and 1958:17) referred specimens from El Peten to  _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_ (Cope). Stuart (1941b:197) described  _Eleutherodactylus anzuetoi_ from Alta Verapaz and El Quiche, Guatemala,  suggested that the new species was an upland relative of  _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ (Werner), and used that name for the frogs  that he earlier had referred to _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_. Dunn and  Emlen (1932:24) placed _E. rostralis_ in the synonymy of _E. gollmeri_  (Peters). Examination of series of these frogs from southern Mexico,  Guatemala, and Costa Rica causes me to think that there are four  species; these can be distinguished as follows:          _E. rhodopis._--No web between toes; one tarsal tubercle;        tibiotarsal articulation reaches to nostril; iris bronze in        life.          _E. anzuetoi._--No web between toes; a row of tarsal        tubercles; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to tip of snout;        color of iris unknown.          _E. rostralis._--A vestige of web between toes; no tarsal        tubercles; tibiotarsal articulation reaches snout or slightly        beyond; iris coppery red in life.          _E. gollmeri._--A vestige of web between toes; no tarsal        tubercles; tibiotarsal articulation reaches well beyond snout;        iris coppery red in life.    The presence of webbing between the toes, the absence of tarsal  tubercles, and the coppery red iris distinguish _E. rostralis_ and _E.  gollmeri_ from the other species. Probably _E. rostralis_ and _E.  gollmeri_ are conspecific, but additional specimens are needed from  Nicaragua and Honduras to prove conspecificity. On the other hand, the  characters of the frogs from Chinaja clearly show that they are related  to _E. gollmeri_ to the south and not to _E. rhodopis_ to the north in  Mexico.    At Chinaja, _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ was more abundant than the  few specimens indicate, for upon being approached the frogs moved  quickly and erratically, soon disappearing in the leaf litter on the  forest floor. Most of the specimens were seen actively moving on the  forest floor in the daytime; one was found beneath a rock, and one was  on the forest floor at night.      =Eleutherodactylus rugulosus rugulosus= (Cope)          Chinaja, 2; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 4.    These frogs were found on the forest floor by day. With the exception of  one female having a snout-vent length of 69.5 mm., all are juveniles.  The apparent rarity of this species at Chinaja may be due to the absence  of rocky streams, a favorite habitat of this frog. The local name for  this frog is _sapito_, meaning little toad.      =Leptodactylus labialis= (Cope)          Toocog, 1.    One juvenile having a snout-vent length of 16.4 mm. was found at night  beside a pond in the forest. The scarcity of the species of  _Leptodactylus_ in the southern part of El Peten probably is due to the  lack of permanent marshy ponds.      =Leptodactylus melanonotus= (Hallowell)          Sayaxche, 1.    One individual was found beneath a rock beside a stream in the forest.  The local name is _ranita_, meaning little frog.      =Syrrhophus leprus= Cope          Chinaja, 2; 15 km NW of Chinaja, 1.    An adult female having a snout-vent length of 27.5 mm. was found on the  forest floor by day. Two juveniles having snout-vent lengths of 15.5 and  19.0 mm. were beneath rocks on the forest floor. The specimens are  typical of the species as defined by Duellman (1958:8).      =Hyla ebraccata= Cope          Toocog, 66.    This small tree frog congregated in large numbers at a forest pond at  Toocog. Between June 30 and July 2 we collected specimens and observed  the breeding habits of this and other species at the pond. Calling males  were distributed around the pond, where they called from low herbaceous  vegetation at the edge of the pond or from plants rising above the  water. Calling commenced at dusk and continued at least into the early  hours of the morning. On one occasion a female was observed at a  distance of about 50 centimeters away from a calling male sitting on a  blade of grass. The female climbed another blade of grass until she was  about eight centimeters away from the male, at which time he saw her,  stopped calling, jumped to the blade of grass on which she was sitting  and clasped her. Clasping pairs were observed on blades of grass and  leaves of plants above the water; most pairs were less than 50  centimeters above the surface of the pond.    The eggs are deposited on the dorsal surfaces of leaves above the water.  All eggs are in one plane (a single layer) on the leaf. External  membranes are barely visible, as the eggs consist of a single coherent  mass. Eggs in the yolk plug stage have diameters of 1.2 to 1.4 mm.  Seventeen eggs masses were found; these contained from 24 to 76 (average  44) eggs. The jelly is extremely viscous and tacky to the touch. At time  of hatching the jelly becomes less viscous; the tadpoles wriggle until  they reach the edge of the leaf and drop into the water.    Eleven tadpoles were preserved as they hatched; these have total lengths  of 4.5 to 5.0 (average 4.77) mm. Hatchling tadpoles are active swimmers  and have only a small amount of yolk. The largest tadpoles preserved  have total lengths of 13.0 and 13.5 mm. At this size distinctive  sword-tail and bright coloration have developed.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Tadpole of _Hyla ebraccata_ (KU 59986) from  Toocog, El Peten, Guatemala. x 6.]    Description of fully developed tadpole (KU 59986): Total length, 13.5  mm.; tail-length, 8.4 mm., 62 per cent of total length. Snout, in dorsal  view, bluntly rounded; in lateral view less bluntly rounded; body  depressed; head flattened; mouth terminal; eye large, its diameter 25  per cent of length of body; nostrils near tip of snout and directed  anteriorly; spiracle sinistral and situated postero-ventrad to eye;  cloaca median. Tail-fin thrice depth of tail-musculature, which extends  beyond posterior end of tail-fin giving sword-tail appearance (Fig. 2).  In life, black stripe on each side of body and on top of head; black  band on anterior part of tail and another on the posterior part; body  and anterior part of tail creamy yellow; dark red band between black  bands on tail. Mouth terminal, small, its width about one-fifth width of  body; fleshy ridge dorsally and ventrally; row of small papillae on  ventral lip; no lateral indentations of lips; upper beak massive,  convex, and finely serrate; lower beak small and mostly concealed behind  upper; no teeth (Fig. 3).    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Mouthparts of larval _Hyla ebraccata_ (KU 59986)  from Toocog, El Peten, Guatemala. x 100.]      =Hyla loquax= Gaige and Stuart          Toocog, 14.    These specimens were found at night when they were calling from low  vegetation in a forest pond. Most of the frogs were several meters away  from the edge of the pond. Although two clasping pairs were found, we  obtained no eggs or tadpoles referable to this species.      =Hyla microcephala martini= Smith          Chinaja, 1; Toocog, 21.    The specimen from Chinaja was calling from a small bush at the edge of a  temporary grassy pond in a clearing in the forest. At Toocog this  species was closely associated with _Hyla ebraccata_; males were calling  from herbaceous vegetation in and around the forest pond. These frogs  were not so abundant in the forest at Toocog as they were around ponds  on the savanna at La Libertad.      =Hyla picta= (Guenther)          Toocog, 8.    This small tree frog was calling from herbs in a pond in the forest on  June 30 and July 2. The voice is weak; probably greater numbers of males  were present than are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38404"],[0,"A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in (#5)"],[1," for the quiet and observant young man who was accompanying him.  Hearne's sketch of the life of Matonabbee is one of the most  appreciative and sympathetic accounts of a North American Indian that  has come to my notice.    Hearne was evidently gifted with a very retentive memory, and had the  artist's faculty of seeing the interesting features of his surroundings  in their true perspective. Though, like Robert Louis Stevenson and many  others, he had not been a brilliant student at school, he possessed the  literary ability to present what he saw or knew in an interesting and  attractive form. In the ordinary quietude of his tent or office, when  thinking of nothing but the subject which he was describing, he  undoubtedly recorded his observations with accuracy. But in the warmth  of dispute, when endeavouring to overcome the criticisms or objections  of others, he was liable to be carried beyond the points of strict  accuracy and, in order to strengthen his argument, to fill in blanks in  his record from his imagination. He says, for example, that the sun was  above the horizon at midnight at the mouth of the Coppermine River. But  it is certain either that, on the night which he spent there, the  weather was too cloudy to permit of seeing the sun, if it had been above  the horizon, or that, even if the weather was clear, the sun must  necessarily have been below the horizon at the time. His sketch of Moses  Norton also has the appearance of being highly coloured by his evident  personal dislike of the man. No one can justly accuse Hearne of lack of  personal courage, for the annoyances, hardships, and sufferings, which  he endured without complaining, put the thought of personal cowardice  entirely out of the question. He had acquired the stoicism of the Indian  and he suffered quietly, just as an Indian is prepared to suffer. During  the years which Hearne spent among the Indians, living on what they were  able to obtain from day to day, as well as in his general intercourse  with them as a trader bartering for the furs which they were able to  collect and bring to him, he had learned to endure privations, to  compromise rather than to fight, and to accomplish his purpose by  politic and peaceful, rather than by warlike, methods. Naturally of a  complaisant disposition, he had learned to give whatever was demanded of  him, no matter who made the demand. Nothing could be more typical of the  habits which he had thus acquired than the little experiences in  trading, recounted on page 285, where, after an Indian had received full  payment for the furs which he had brought in, he was given in addition  the long list of articles there enumerated. Apparently, the Indian was  not refused anything if he persisted in asking.    This habit of acceding to requests to avoid dispute and difficulty,  rather than any real fear of personal danger, accounts for Hearne's  surrender of Fort Prince of Wales to the French without a struggle. In  this case it is quite possible that, in spite of the great strength of  the fort which he occupied, he was really not able to make effective  resistance against his powerful and determined enemy, who outnumbered  him more than ten to one. Although the fort mounted forty heavy guns,  and was provided with plenty of ammunition and small arms, it had only  thirty-nine men within its walls at the time. But even if Hearne had had  a stronger garrison, it is doubtful whether he would have attempted  resistance, for his training in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company  had taught him to preserve the peace at any price, and it was impossible  for him to set aside at a moment's notice what had become second nature  to him.    We have seen that Hearne had not the forceful character possessed by  Alexander Mackenzie; yet, as a man must be judged by the results which  he achieves, it is perhaps all the more creditable to him to have done  what he did with his more complaisant and observant disposition. Though  he could not control the Indians with whom he travelled, he nevertheless  accomplished his purpose of making the journey, and has left a splendid  record of it to enrich posterity. He was hardly a great geographer,  though he added largely to the geographical knowledge of Northern Canada  west of Hudson Bay. It was he who finally set at rest the question of a  north-west passage by sea to China and the Orient, south of the mouth of  the Coppermine River. He knew nothing of mines or ores, and the  information he brought back about the \"mine\" of copper which he was  sent to explore was exceedingly meagre. He verified the report of the  existence of native copper on the surface in uncertain quantity.  Incidentally he showed that the place where it occurred was too remote  and difficult of access to permit of a copper mine being worked at a  profit, even if the copper should be found in great abundance. But that  was all. In fact, even to the present time, we have very little accurate  knowledge of the character and extent of this copper deposit near the  Coppermine River, as may be seen by referring to the notes on pages 194  _et seq._    On Hearne's first and second journeys he had quite adequate scientific  apparatus, and so could take astronomical observations to determine his  true position. So we find that he occasionally made use of his quadrant  and took such observations; consequently the positions given on the map  for the principal points in these two journeys are approximately  correct. But he started on his third journey with very faulty  instruments, and he would appear to have made very little use even of  them. The map of the course followed by him on this journey strongly  suggests a rough sketch made by his Indian guide, rather than a careful  plan worked out by himself, from day to day, or week to week. For  example, between Island and Kasba Lakes, near the beginning of his  journey, and shortly after he had diverged from his course of the  previous year, he began to go wrong. If he was using his compass at all,  it is possible that some source of local magnetic attraction was  influencing it, for the position of the last-named lake (on his map) is  some sixty or seventy miles too far north. It is inconceivable that he  could have made any serious effort to correct this faulty course by  astronomical observations with his quadrant. His book is chiefly  valuable therefore not so much because of its geographical information,  but because it is an accurate, sympathetic, and patently truthful record  of life among the Chipewyan Indians at that time. Their habits, customs,  and general mode of life, however disagreeable or repulsive, are  recorded in detail, and the book will consequently always remain a  classic in American ethnology.    The manuscript report on Hearne's exploration was submitted to the  directors of the Hudson's Bay Company immediately after his return, and  they highly commended him for the work he had done, and gave him a  handsome bonus.[10] The first account of his journey which seems to have  been published was given to the world in 1784 in the \"Introduction to  Cook's Third Voyage,\" pp. xlvi-l, written by Dr. John Douglas, Bishop of  Salisbury, who later also edited Hearne's own book. The route followed  by Hearne on his successful third journey is incorporated in the general  map of the world accompanying this book. A Mr. Roberts, who prepared  this map, makes the following note with regard to it:--        \"The whole of Hudson's Bay I took from a chart compiled by Mr.      Marley, from all the most authentic maps he could procure of      those parts, with which I was favoured by Samuel Wegg, Esq.,      F.R.S., and Governor of that Company, who also politely      furnished me with Mr. Hearne's Journals and the map of his route      to the Coppermine River, which is faithfully inserted in the      chart.        \"(Sgd.) HENRY ROBERTS.      \"SHOREHAM, SUSSEX, _May 18, 1784_.\"[11]    Another brief account of Hearne's trip is given in \"Pennant's Arctic  Zoology,\" also published in 1784, while his map is incorporated in one  of the maps published in \"Pennant's Supplement to Arctic Zoology,\" 1787.  Some of the names used on these two maps were continued on the map  accompanying Alexander Mackenzie's \"Voyages,\" and also on Arrowsmith's  maps up to comparatively recent dates.    [Illustration: MAP OF PART OF NORTH AMERICA  Being a portion of the Map of the World in \"Cook's Third Voyage,\"  published in 1784 Hearne's route was first published on this map]    [Illustration: MAP OF PART OF NORTH AMERICA  Showing General Course of Hearne's Third Journey _From the Second Map of  Mr. Pennant's \"Arctic Zoology,\" 1787_]    The book here republished appeared first in 1795, three years after  Hearne's death, as a large quarto volume of xliv + 458 pages, with five  maps, and four full-page illustrations. It was edited by the above-named  Dr. John Douglas, who is said to have drawn up the narrative, and to  have finished the Introduction, though just how much Hearne's diction  was altered by the editor is not known. It is probable, however, that  the MS. was published almost exactly as Hearne had written it. An octavo  edition, similar in letterpress to the original quarto one, but with  some slight omissions or differences in the text and in the general map,  was published in Dublin in 1796.    A French translation of the 1795 edition, by Lallemant, one of the  secretaries in the French Department of the Marine, was published at  Paris in 1799. Dr. Arthur G. Doughty, the Archivist of the Dominion of  Canada, has very kindly compared this edition with the English one of  1795, and makes the following remarks with regard to it:--        \"The dedication of the English version is omitted in the French.      In the Introduction, page 27, there is a note in the English      edition which is not translated. Pages 441 to 445 of the English      edition are omitted in the French."]]]
