Nature has her wiles, and persuades man, obstinately opposed though he  be to progress and change; Nature progresses continually and changes  unremittingly, but with so even and unnoticeable movement that men  perceive only quiescence. Only on looking backward from a distance do  they note with astonishment that they have been deceived.    The Reformer of any given period excites irritation for the reason that  his changes find men unprepared, and, above all, because these changes  are appreciable. The Reformer, in comparison with Nature, is  undiplomatic; and, as a wholly logical consequence, his changes do not  win general acceptance until Time, with subtle, imperceptible advance,  has bridged over the leap of the self-assured leader. Yet we find cases  in which the reformer marched abreast of the times, while the rest fell  behind. And then they have to be forced and lashed to take the leap  across the passage they have missed. I believe that the major-and-minor  key with its transpositional relations, our \"twelve-semitone system,\"  exhibits such a case of falling behind.                               *       *       *    That some few have already felt how the intervals of the Series of Seven  might be differently arranged (graduated) is manifested in isolated  passages by Liszt, and recently by Debussy and his following, and even  by Richard Strauss. Strong impulse, longing, gifted instinct, all speak  from these strains. Yet it does not appear to me that a conscious and  orderly conception of this intensified means of expression had been  formed by these composers.    I have made an attempt to exhaust the possibilities of the arrangement  of degrees within the seven-tone scale; and succeeded, by raising and  lowering the intervals, in establishing _one hundred and thirteen  different scales_. These 113 scales (within the octave _C-C_) comprise  the greater part of our familiar twenty-four keys, and, furthermore, a  series of new keys of peculiar character. But with these the mine is not  exhausted, for we are at liberty to _transpose_ each one of these 113,  besides the blending of two such keys in harmony and melody.    There is a significant difference between the sound of the scale  _c-db-eb-fb-gb-ab-bb-c_ when _c_ is taken as tonic, and the scale of  _db_ minor. By giving it the customary _C_-major triad as a fundamental  harmony, a novel harmonic sensation is obtained. But now listen to this  same scale supported alternately by the _A_-minor, _Eb_-major, and  _C_-major triads, and you cannot avoid a feeling of delightful surprise  at the strangely unfamiliar euphony.    But how would a lawgiver classify the tone-series  _c-db-eb-fb-g-a-b-c_, _c-db-eb-f-gb-a-b-c_, _c-d-eb-fb-gb-a-b-c_,  _c-db-e-f-gb-a-bb-c_?--or these, forsooth: _c-d-eb-fb-g-a#-b-c_,  _c-d-eb-fb-g#-a-b-c_, _c-db-eb-f#-g#-a-bb-c_?    One cannot estimate at a glance what wealth of melodic and harmonic  expression would thus be opened up to the hearing; but a great many  novel possibilities may be accepted as certain, and are perceptible at a  glance.                               *       *       *    With this presentation, the unity of all keys may be considered as  finally pronounced and justified. A kaleidoscopic blending and  interchanging of twelve semitones within the three-mirror tube of Taste,  Emotion, and Intention--the essential feature of the harmony of to-day.                               *       *       *    The harmony of _to-day_, and not for long; for all signs presage a  revolution, and a next step toward that \"eternal harmony.\" Let us once  again call to mind, that in this latter the gradation of the octave is  _infinite_, and let us strive to draw a little nearer to infinitude.  The tripartite tone (third of a tone) has for some time been demanding  admittance, and we have left the call unheeded. Whoever has  experimented, like myself (in a modest way), with this interval, and  introduced (either with voice or with violin) two equidistant  intermediate tones between the extremes of a whole tone, schooling his  ear and his precision of attack, will not have failed to discern that  tripartite tones are wholly independent intervals with a pronounced  character, and not to be confounded with ill-tuned semitones. They form  a refinement in chromatics based, as at present appears, on the  whole-tone scale. Were we to adopt them without further preparation, we  should have to give up the semitones and lose our \"minor third\" and  \"perfect fifth;\" and this loss would be felt more keenly than the  relative gain of a system of eighteen one-third tones.    But there is no apparent reason for giving up the semitones for the sake  of this new system. By retaining, for each whole tone, a semitone, we  obtain a second series of whole tones lying a semitone higher than the  original series. Then, by dividing this second series of whole tones  into third-tones, each third-tone in the lower series will be matched by  a semitone in the higher series.    Thus we have really arrived at a system of whole tones divided into  sixths of a tone; and we may be sure that even sixth-tones will  sometime be adopted into musical speech. But the tonal system above  sketched must first of all train the hearing to thirds of a tone,  without giving up the semitones.    To summarize: We may set up either two series of third-tones, with an  interval of a semitone between the series; or, the usual semitonic  series _thrice repeated_ at the interval of one-third of a tone.    Merely for the sake of distinction, let us call the first tone _C_, and  the next third-tones _C#_, and _Db_; the first semitone (small) _c_, and  its following thirds _c#_ and _db_; the result is fully explained by the  table below:    [Music]    A preliminary expedient for notation might be, to draw six lines for the  staff, using the lines for the whole tones and the spaces for the  semitones:    [Music]    then indicating the third-tones by sharps and flats:    [Music]    The question of notation seems to me subordinate. On the other hand, the  question is important and imperious, how and on what these tones are to  be produced. Fortunately, while busied with this essay, I received from  America direct and authentic intelligence which solves the problem in a  simple manner. I refer to an invention by Dr. Thaddeus Cahill.[Q] He has  constructed a comprehensive apparatus which makes it possible to  transform an electric current into a fixed and mathematically exact  number of vibrations. As pitch depends on the number of vibrations, and  the apparatus may be \"set\" on any number desired, the infinite gradation  of the octave may be accomplished by merely moving a lever corresponding  to the pointer of a quadrant.

Only a long and careful series of experiments, and a continued training  of the ear, can render this unfamiliar material approachable and plastic  for the coming generation, and for Art.                               *       *       *    And what a vista of fair hopes and dreamlike fancies is thus opened for  them both! Who has not dreamt that he could float on air? and firmly  believed his dream to be reality?--Let us take thought, how music may be  restored to its primitive, natural essence; let us free it from  architectonic, acoustic and esthetic dogmas; let it be pure invention  and sentiment, in harmonies, in forms, in tone-colors (for invention and  sentiment are not the prerogative of melody alone); let it follow the  line of the rainbow and vie with the clouds in breaking sunbeams; _let  Music be naught else than Nature mirrored by and reflected from the  human breast_; for it is sounding air and floats above and beyond the  air; within Man himself as universally and absolutely as in Creation  entire; for it can gather together and disperse without losing in  intensity.                               *       *       *    IN his book \"Beyond the Good and the Bad\" (_Jenseits von Gut und BÃ¶se_)  Nietzsche says: \"With regard to German music I consider precaution  necessary in various ways. Assuming that a person loves the South (as I  love it) as a great training-school for health of soul and sense in  their highest potency, as an uncontrollable flood and glamour of  sunshine spreading over a race of independent and self-reliant  beings;--well, such an one will learn to be more or less on his guard  against German music, because, while spoiling his taste anew, it  undermines his health.    \"Such a Southlander (not by descent, but by belief) must, should he  dream of the future of music, likewise dream of a redemption of music  from the North, while in his ears there rings the prelude to a deeper,  mightier, perchance a more evil and more mysterious music, a  super-German music, which does not fade, wither and die away in view of  the blue, sensuous sea and the splendor of Mediterranean skies, as all  German music does;--a super-European music, that asserts itself even  amid the tawny sunsets of the desert, whose soul is allied with the  palm-tree, and can consort and prowl with great, beautiful, lonely  beasts of prey.    \"I could imagine a music whose rarest charm should consist in its  complete divorce from the Good and the Bad;--only that its surface might  be ruffled, as it were, by a longing as of a sailor for home, by  variable golden shadows and tender frailties:--an Art which should see  fleeing toward it, from afar off, the hues of a perishing moral world  become wellnigh incomprehensible, and which should be hospitable and  profound enough to harbor such belated fugitives.\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31847"],[0,"Dog Stories from the \"Spectator\" (#5)"],[1,"Prin's death, for there is  every reason to fear that he fell a victim to copper-poisoning.    By a little training he was taught to place the coins, after he had got  the biscuits, upon the top of a small box fixed on the wall, and they  were dropped for him through a slot. He never objected to part with them  in this way, and having received the _quid pro quo_, he gave complete  evidence of his appreciation of the honourable understanding which is so  absolutely necessary for all commercial transactions.    An authenticated case like this is of extreme value, for just as the  elementary stages of any science or discovery are the most difficult and  the slowest in accomplishment, so are the primary stages of all mental  processes. To find the preliminary steps of the evolution of mathematics  and commerce in a dog is therefore a very important observation, and  everything bearing on these early phases of intellect should be  carefully recorded.              LAWSON TAIT.                [_Feb. 10, 1877._]    The _Spectator_ is always so kind to animals that I venture to send you  the following story of a dog's sagacity, which may be depended upon as  absolutely true:--    During the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow, a friend of  mine had occasion to go one day from that place to Greenock on business.  Hearing, on his arrival, that the person he wished to see was out, but  expected shortly to return home, he determined to take a stroll about  the town, to which he was a stranger. In the course of his walk he  turned into a baker's shop and bought a bun. As he stood at the door of  the shop eating his bun, a large dog came up to him and begged for a  share, which he got, and seemed to enjoy, coming back for piece after  piece. \"Does the dog belong to you?\" my friend asked of the shop-woman.  \"No,\" she answered, \"but he spends most of his time here, and begs  halfpennies from the people who pass.\" \"Halfpennies! What good can they  be to him?\" \"Oh, he knows very well what to do with them; he comes into  the shop and buys cakes.\"    This seemed rather a remarkable instance of cleverness even for the  cleverest of animals, so, by way of testing its reality, my friend went  out of the shop into the street, where he was immediately accosted by  the dog, who begged for _something_ with all the eloquence of which a  dog is capable. He offered him a halfpenny, and was rather surprised to  see him accept it readily, and walk, with the air of a regular customer,  into the shop, where he put his forepaws on the counter, and held out  the halfpenny towards the attendant. The young woman produced a bun, but  that did not suit the dog, and he held his money fast. \"Ah,\" she said,  \"I know what he wants,\" and took down from a shelf a plate of  shortbread. This was right; the dog paid his halfpenny, took his  shortbread, and ate it with decorous satisfaction. When he had quite  finished he left the shop, and my friend, much amused, followed him, and  when he again begged found another halfpenny for him, and saw the whole  process gone through a second time.    This dog clearly had learned by some means the use of money, and not  merely that it would buy something to eat, but that it would buy  several things, among which he could exercise a right of choice. What is  perhaps most remarkable is that his proceedings were entirely  independent, and for his own benefit, not that of any teacher or master.              A. L. W.                [_Feb. 17, 1877._]    When a student at Edinburgh, I enjoyed the friendship of a brown  retriever, who belonged to a fishmonger in Lothion Street, and who was  certainly the cleverest dog I have ever met with. He was a cleverer dog  than the one described by \"A. L. W.\" because he knew the relative value  of certain coins. In the morning he was generally to be seen seated on  the step of the fishmonger's shop-door, waiting for some of his many  friends to give him a copper. When he had got one, he trotted away to a  baker's shop a few doors off, and dropped the coin on the counter. If I  remember rightly (it is twelve or fifteen years ago), his weakness was  \"soda scones.\" If he dropped a halfpenny on the counter he was  contented with one scone, but if he had given a penny he expected two,  and would wait for the second, after he had eaten the first, until he  got it. That he knew exactly when he was entitled to one scone only, and  when he ought to get two, is certain, for I tried him often.              LAWSON TAIT.                [_Feb. 17, 1877._]    In the _Spectator_ of the 10th inst. a correspondent describes the  purchase of cakes by a clever dog at Greenock. I should like to be  allowed to help preserve the memory of a most worthy dog-friend of my  youth, well remembered by many now living who knew Greenwich Hospital  some thirty or five-and-thirty years ago.    At that time there lived there a dog-pensioner called Hardy, a large  brown Irish retriever. He was so named by Sir Thomas Hardy, when  Governor (Nelson's Hardy), who at the same time constituted him a  pensioner, at the rate of one penny per diem, for that he had one day  saved a life from drowning just opposite the hospital. Till that time  he was a poor stranger and vagrant dog--friendless. But thenceforward he  lived in the hospital, and _spent his pension himself_ at the butcher's  shop, as he did also many another coin given to him by numerous friends.  Many is the halfpenny which, as a child, I gave Hardy, that I might see  him buy his own meat--which he did with judgment, and a due regard to  value. When a _penny_ was given to him, he would, on arriving at the  shop, place it on the counter and rest his nose or paw upon it until he  received _two halfpennyworths_, nor would any persuasion induce him to  give up the coin for the usual smaller allowance. I was a young child at  the time, but I had a great veneration for Hardy, and remember him well,  but lest my juvenile memory might have been in fault, I have, before  writing this letter, compared my recollections with those of my elders,  who, as grown people, knew Hardy for many years, and confirm all the  above facts. There, indeed, was the right dog in the right place. Peace  to his shade!              J. D. C.                [_Feb. 7, 1885._]    Have you room for one more dog story, which resembles one lately  reported in a French journal? A few years since I was sitting inside the  door of a shop to escape from the rain while waiting for a trap to take  me to the railway station in the old Etruscan city of Ferentino.  Presently an ill-bred dog of the pointer kind came and sat down in front  of me, looking up in my face, and wagging his tail to attract my  attention. \"What does that dog want?\" I asked of a bystander. \"Signore,\"  he answered, \"he wants you to give him a soldo to go and buy you a cigar  with.\" I gave the dog the coin, and he presently returned, bringing a  cigar, which he held crossways in his mouth until I took it from him.  Sent again and again, he brought me three or four more cigars from the  tobacco-shop. At length the dog's demeanour changed, and he gave vent to  his impatience by two or three low whines. \"What does he want now?\" I  asked. \"He wants you to give him two soldi to go to the baker's and buy  bread for himself.\" I gave him a two-soldo piece, and in a few minutes  the dog returned with a small loaf of bread, which he laid at my feet,  at the same time gazing wistfully in my face. \"He won't take it until  you give him leave,\" said another bystander. I gave the requisite  permission, and the dear animal seized the loaf and disappeared with it  in his mouth, and did not again make his appearance before I left the  city. \"He always does like this,\" said the standers-by, \"whenever he  sees a stranger in Ferentino.\"              GREVILLE I. CHESTER.      CAUTIOUS DOGS.      INTELLIGENT SUSPICION IN A DOG.              [_July 7, 1888._]    The following instance of dog instinct (or reasoning?) will, I think,  interest some of your readers. About a fortnight ago, while crossing the  Albula Pass, our driver stopped for a few moments at the little  restaurant on the highest point of it. A rough kind of herdsman's dog,  of no particular breed, I suppose, came out and sat down by the carriage  and looked up at us. We happened to have a few Marie biscuits in the  carriage, so I threw half of one out to him. I suppose he had no  experience in Huntley and Palmer's make, for he looked at and smelled it  carefully, and then declined to eat it, but again looked up at me. I  then took the remaining half, bit off and ate a little bit of it, and  then threw over the rest to him. This time he ate it at once, then  turned and ate the first piece, which he had before refused, and at once  came and asked for more, which I had great pleasure in giving him. I  may add that I have several times tried a similar experiment with more  pampered dogs at home, but have never succeeded with it. Whether this  arises from the latter knowing, in most cases, from experience what they  like and what they do not like, or, as I am rather inclined to think,  from the superior intelligence of this Alpine dog, who really reasoned  that what I could eat he could, I leave your readers to decide for  themselves.              G. W. C.      AN ALPINE DOG.              [_July 21, 1888._]    I do not think that it was superior intelligence in the Alpine dog over  other intelligent dogs which induced him to wait to eat the biscuit till  he had seen the giver eat some of it. We have a very sagacious little  Highland terrier, and he in the same manner often refuses a new kind of  biscuit or cake until he has seen me bite off a small piece and eat it,  and then he will do the same. I have also found our boarhound  distrusting food occasionally, and declining to take it from his bowl  until I have given him some with my hand. Then he seems to feel that it  is all right, and"]]]
