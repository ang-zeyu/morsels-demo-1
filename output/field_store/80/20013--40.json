He held a confidential  correspondence with these great Dutch booksellers, who consulted him in  their distresses; and he seems rather to have relieved them than  himself. But if he got only a few florins at Rotterdam, the same  \"nouvelles litteraires\" sometimes secured him valuable friends at  London; for in those days, which perhaps are returning on us, an English  author would often appeal to a foreign journal for the commendation he  might fail in obtaining at home; and I have discovered, in more cases  than one, that, like other smuggled commodities, the foreign article was  often of home manufactory!    I give one of these curious bibliopolical distresses. Sauzet, a  bookseller at Rotterdam, who judged too critically for the repose of his  authors, seems to have been always fond of projecting a new \"Journal;\"  tormented by the ideal excellence which he had conceived of such a work,  it vexed him that he could never find the workmen! Once disappointed of  the assistance he expected from a writer of talents, he was fain to put  up with one he was ashamed of; but warily stipulated on very singular  terms. He confided this precious literary secret to Des Maizeaux. I  translate from his manuscript letter.    \"I send you, my dear Sir, four sheets of the continuation of my journal,  and I hope this second part will turn out better than the former. The  author thinks himself a very able person; but I must tell you frankly,  that he is a man without erudition, and without any critical  discrimination; he writes pretty well, and turns passably what he says;  but that is all! Monsieur Van Effen having failed in his promises to  realise my hopes on this occasion, necessity compelled me to have  recourse to him; but for _six months only_, and on condition that he  should not, on any account whatever, _allow any one to know that he is  the author of the journal_; for his _name_ alone would be sufficient to  make even a passable book discreditable. As you are among my friends, I  will confide to you in secrecy the name of this author; it is Mons. _De  Limiers_.[14] You see how much my interest is concerned that the author  should not be known!\" This anecdote is gratuitously presented to the  editors of certain reviews, as a serviceable hint to enter into the same  engagement with some of their own writers: for it is usually the _De  Limiers_ who expend their last puff in blowing their own name about the  town.    In England, Des Maizeaux, as a literary man, made himself very useful to  other men of letters, and particularly to persons of rank: and he found  patronage and a pension,--like his talents, very moderate! A friend to  literary men, he lived amongst them, from \"Orator\" Henley, up to  Addison, Lord Halifax, and Anthony Collins. I find a curious character  of our Des Maizeaux in the handwriting of Edward, Earl of Oxford, to  whose father (Pope's Earl of Oxford) and himself the nation owes the  Harleian treasures. His lordship is a critic with high Tory principles,  and high-church notions. \"This Des Maizeaux is a great man with those  who are pleased to be called _Freethinkers_, particularly with Mr.  Anthony Collins, collects passages out of books for their writings. His  Life of Chillingworth is wrote to please that set of men.\" The secret  history I am to unfold relates to Anthony Collins and Des Maizeaux. Some  curious book-lovers will be interested in the personal history of an  author they are well acquainted with, yet which has hitherto remained  unknown. He tells his own story in a sort of epistolary petition he  addressed to a noble friend, characteristic of an author, who cannot be  deemed unpatronised, yet whose name, after all his painful labours,  might be inserted in my \"Calamities of Authors.\"    In this letter he announces his intention of publishing a Dictionary  like Bayle; having written the life of Bayle, the next step was to  become himself a Bayle; so short is the passage of literary delusion! He  had published, as a specimen, the lives of Hales and Chillingworth. He  complains that his circumstances have not allowed him to forward that  work, nor digest the materials he had collected.       A work of that nature requires a steady application, free from the     cares and avocations incident to all persons obliged to seek for     their maintenance. I have had the misfortune to be in the case of     those persons, and am now reduced to a pension on the Irish     establishment, which, deducting the tax of four shillings in the     pound, and other charges, brings me in about 40_l._ a year of our     English money.[15] This pension was granted to me in 1710, and I owe     it chiefly to the friendship of Mr. Addison, who was then secretary     to the Earl of Wharton, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1711, 12, and     14, I was appointed one of the Commissioners of the Lottery by the     interest of Lord Halifax.       And this is all I ever received from the Government, though I had     some claim to the royal favour; for in 1710, when the enemies to our     constitution were contriving its ruin, I wrote a pamphlet entitled     \"Lethe,\" which was published in Holland, and afterwards translated     into English, and twice printed in London; and being reprinted in     Dublin, proved so offensive to the ministry in Ireland, that it was     burnt by the hands of the hangman. But so it is, that after having     showed on all occasions my zeal for the royal family, and endeavoured     to make myself serviceable to the public by several books published;     after forty years' stay in England, and in an advanced age, I find     myself and family destitute of a sufficient livelihood, and suffering     from complaints in the head and impaired sight by constant     application to my studies.       I am confident, my lord, he adds, that if the queen, to whom I was     made known on occasion of Thuanus's French translation, were     acquainted with my present distress, she would be pleased to afford     me some relief.[16]    Among the confidential literary friends of Des Maizeaux, he had the  honour of ranking Anthony Collins, a great lover of literature, and a  man of fine genius, and who, in a continued correspondence with our Des  Maizeaux, treated him as his friend, and employed him as his agent in  his literary concerns. These, in the formation of an extensive library,  were in a state of perpetual activity, and Collins was such a true lover  of his books, that he drew up the catalogue with his own pen.[17]  Anthony Collins wrote several well-known works without prefixing his  name; but having pushed too far his curious inquiries on some obscure  and polemical points, he incurred the odium of a _freethinker_,--a term  which then began to be in vogue, and which the French adopted by  translating it, in their way, _a strong thinker_, or _esprit fort_.  Whatever tendency to \"liberalise\" the mind from _dogmas_ and _creeds_  prevails in these works, the talents and learning of Collins were of the  first class. His morals were immaculate, and his personal character  independent; but the _odium theologicum_ of those days contrived every  means to stab in the dark, till the taste became hereditary with some. I  shall mention a fact of this cruel bigotry, which occurred within my own  observation, on one of the most polished men of the age. The late Mr.  Cumberland, in the romance entitled his \"Life,\" gave this extraordinary  fact, that Dr. Bentley, who so ably replied by his \"Remarks,\" under the  name of Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, to Collins's \"Discourse on  Free-thinking,\" when, many years after, he discovered him fallen into  great distress, conceiving that by having ruined Collins's character as  a writer for ever, he had been the occasion of his personal misery, he  liberally contributed to his maintenance. In vain I mentioned to that  elegant writer, who was not curious about facts, that this person could  never have been _Anthony_ Collins, who had always a plentiful fortune;  and when it was suggested to him that this \"A. Collins,\" as he printed  it, must have been _Arthur_ Collins, the historical compiler, who was  often in pecuniary difficulties, still he persisted in sending the lie  down to posterity, _totidem verbis_, without alteration in his second  edition, observing to a friend of mine, that \"the story, while it told  well, might serve as a striking instance of his great relative's  generosity; and that _it should stand_, because it could do no harm to  any but to _Anthony_ Collins, whom he considered as little short of an  atheist.\" So much for this pious fraud! but be it recollected that this  Anthony Collins was the confidential friend of Locke, of whom Locke  said, on his dying bed, that \"Collins was a man whom he valued in the  first rank of those that he left behind him.\" And the last words of  Collins on his own death-bed were, that \"he was persuaded he was going  to that place which God had designed for them that love him.\" The cause  of true religion will never be assisted by using such leaky vessels as  _Cumberland's_ wilful calumnies, which in the end must run out, and be  found, like the present, mere empty fictions!    An extraordinary circumstance occurred on the death of Anthony Collins.  He left behind him a considerable number of his own manuscripts, there  was one collection formed into eight octavo volumes; and that they might  be secured from the common fate of manuscripts, he bequeathed them all,  and confided them to the care of our Des Maizeaux. The choice of Collins  reflects honour on the character of Des Maizeaux, yet he proved unworthy  of it! He suffered himself to betray his trust, practised on by the  earnest desire of the widow, and perhaps by the arts of a Mr. Tomlinson,  who appears to have been introduced into the family by the  recommendation of Dean Sykes, whom at length he supplanted, and whom the  widow, to save her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#5)"],[1," gentleman, all of whose moveables were a  bootjack and a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the  world; and it is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a  story.    It was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened  that it came to be washed in company with a garter.    \"Nay!\" said the collar, \"I never did see anything so slender and so  fine, so soft and so neat. May I not ask your name?\"    \"That I shall not tell you!\" said the garter.    \"Where do you live?\" asked the collar.    But the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange  question to answer.    \"You are certainly a girdle,\" said the collar; \"that is to say an  inside girdle. I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my  dear young lady.\"    \"I will thank you not to speak to me,\" said the garter. \"I think I  have not given the least occasion for it.\"    \"Yes! when one is as handsome as you,\" said the collar, \"that is  occasion enough.\"    \"Don't come so near me, I beg of you!\" said the garter. \"You look so  much like those men-folks.\"    \"I am also a fine gentleman,\" said the collar. \"I have a boot-jack and  a hair-comb.\"    But that was not true, for it was his master who had them: but he  boasted.    \"Don't come so near me,\" said the garter: \"I am not accustomed to it.\"    \"Prude!\" exclaimed the collar; and then it was taken out of the  washing-tub. It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the  sunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm  box-iron. \"Dear lady!\" said the collar. \"Dear widow-lady! I feel quite  hot. I am quite changed. I begin to unfold myself. You will burn a  hole in me. Oh! I offer you my hand.\"    \"Rag!\" said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she  fancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw  the waggons. \"Rag!\" said the box-iron.    The collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long  scissors to cut off the jagged part.    \"Oh!\" said the collar, \"you are certainly the first opera dancer. How  well you can stretch your legs out! It is the most graceful  performance I have ever seen. No one can imitate you.\"    \"I know it,\" said the scissors.    \"You deserve to be a baroness,\" said the collar. \"All that I have is a  fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the  barony!\"    \"Do you seek my hand?\" said the scissors; for she was angry; and  without more ado, she _cut him_, and then he was condemned.    \"I shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. It is surprising how  well you preserve your teeth, Miss,\" said the collar. \"Have you never  thought of being betrothed?\"    \"Yes, of course! you may be sure of that,\" said the hair comb. \"I _am_  betrothed--to the boot-jack!\"    \"Betrothed!\" exclaimed the collar. Now there was no other to court,  and so he despised it.    A long time passed away, then the collar came into the rag chest at  the paper mill; there was a large company of rags, the fine by  themselves, and the coarse by themselves, just as it should be. They  all had much to say, but the collar the most; for he was a real  boaster.    \"I have had such an immense number of sweet-hearts!\" said the collar,  \"I could not be in peace! It is true, I was always a fine starched-up  gentleman! I had both a bootjack and a hair-comb, which I never used!  You should have seen me then, you should have seen me when I lay  down!--I shall never forget _my first love_--she was a girdle, so  fine, so soft, and so charming, she threw herself into a tub of water  for my sake! There was also a widow, who became glowing hot, but I  left her standing till she got black again; there was also the first  opera dancer, she gave me that cut which I now go with, she was so  ferocious! my own hair-comb was in love with me, she lost all her  teeth from the heart-ache; yes, I have lived to see much of that sort  of thing; but I am extremely sorry for the garter--I mean the  girdle--that went into the water-tub. I have much on my conscience, I  want to become white paper!\"    And it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the  collar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see, and  on which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so  terribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well  for us to beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can  never know if we may not, in the course of time, also come into the  rag chest, and be made into white paper, and then have our whole  life's history printed on it, even the most secret, and be obliged to  run about and tell it ourselves, just like this collar.      ------------        THE SHADOW.    It is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough!--there the  people become quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the _hottest_ lands  they are burnt to negroes. But now it was only to the _hot_ lands that  a learned man had come from the cold; there he thought that he could  run about just as when at home, but he soon found out his mistake.    He, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors,--the  window-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if  the whole house slept, or there was no one at home.    The narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine  must fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be  borne.    The learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man, and seemed to  be a clever man--sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he  became quite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also  an effect on it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down,  that they began to freshen up again.    In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out  on all the balconies in the street--for one must have air, even if one  be accustomed to be mahogany!* It was lively both up and down the  street. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the  street--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes,  above a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other  sung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along  with a dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys  were screaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and  detonating balls:--and there came corpse bearers and hood  wearers,--for there were funerals with psalm and hymn,--and then the  din of carriages driving and company arriving:--yes, it was, in truth,  lively enough down in the street. Only in that single house, which  stood opposite that in which the learned foreigner lived, it was quite  still; and yet some one lived there, for there stood flowers in the  balcony--they grew so well in the sun's heat--and that they could not  do unless they were watered--and some one must water them--there must  be somebody there. The door opposite was also opened late in the  evening, but it was dark within, at least in the front room; further  in there was heard the sound of music. The learned foreigner thought  it quite marvellous, but now--it might be that he only imagined  it--for he found everything marvellous out there, in the warm lands,  if there had only been no sun. The stranger's landlord said that he  didn't know who had taken the house opposite, one saw no person about,  and as to the music, it appeared to him to be extremely tiresome. \"It  is as if some one sat there, and practised a piece that he could not  master--always the same piece. 'I shall master it!' says he; but yet  he cannot master it, however long he plays.\"    ------    * The word _mahogany_ can be understood, in Danish, as having two  meanings. In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in  jest, it signifies \"excessively fine,\" which arose from an anecdote of  Nyboder, in Copenhagen, (the seamen's quarter.) A sailor's wife, who  was always proud and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and  complained that she had got a splinter in her finger. \"What of?\" asked  the neighbor's wife. \"It is a mahogany splinter;\" said the other.  \"Mahogany! it cannot be less with you!\" exclaimed the woman;--and  thence the proverb, \"It is so mahogany!\"--(that is, so excessively  fine)--is derived.    ------    One night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony  open--the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought  that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the  flowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the  midst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden,--it was as if  she also shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them  quite wide--yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the  floor; he crept gently behind the curtain but the maiden was gone; the  flowers shone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as  ever; the door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft  and delightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it.  Yet it was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was  the actual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops,  and there people could not always be running through.    One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in  the room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow  should fall on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat,  directly opposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the  stranger moved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.    \"I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,\" said  the learned man. \"See! how nicely it sits between the flowers. The  door stands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into  the room, look about, and then come and tell me what it had seen.  Come, now! be useful, and do me a service,\" said he, in jest. \"Have  the "]]]
