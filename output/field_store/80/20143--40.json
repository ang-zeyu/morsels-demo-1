Another of this sort is well exemplified in the character of an old  gentleman in Pennsylvania who loudly proclaims against trout fishing,  but who utterly ruins nearly eight miles of trout water, once the home  of thousands of lordly fish, by permitting his mill hands to run off  sawdust in the streams.    This poor, ignorant soul objects to you and me chivalrously taking  half a dozen specimens on the fly--catching the cunning trout with an  imitation of the living thing itself destroys by the thousands for  food and play--while he mercilessly slaughters the entire immediate  supply, and prevents further propagation of the whole species with the  refuse of his forest-devastating, money-making machine.    True, the Angler like all fishermen, and like the fishes themselves,  kills his specimens, but this killing is ordained by nature  herself--at least it has better grounds for excuse, if excuse it  needs, than that ten-fold more destructive killing _by_ the fishes  that not only slay for food, but actually mutilate millions upon  millions of their kind for the mere play afforded them in this  practice--and though the Angler may be in the wrong when he humanely  dispatches a few of the batch he breeds, he is not as hopeless as the  wanton fisher, or as brutal as the unenlightened \"reformers,\" the  so-called humane lady with the fashionable furs and feathers of  fast-disappearing species she never turns a hair to replenish or  protect, and the old gentleman hypocrite with his murderous sawmill.          CHAPTER IV    FLY-FISHING      \"Of all sports, commend me to angling; it is the wisest, virtuousest,  best.\"--THOMAS HOOD.    When I go fishing, it is for the purpose of catching fish; when I go  angling--fly-fishing--it is the soul I seek to replenish, not the  creel.    \"One of the charms of angling,\" says Pritt, \"is that it presents an  endless field for argument, speculation, and experiment.\"    True, but Anglers have no argument in the first feature of their  pastime--the object of it. Fishermen and men who do not go fishing or  angling argue that the object sought by the Angler is the fish, but  Anglers all agree that the game is but one of the trillion of pleasant  things that attract them to the pursuit of it.    They argue and speculate and experiment in the matter of rods and  tackle, and they argue as to the virtues of the various species, the  qualities of the waters, the conditions of the weather, but they have  ever been and ever will be calmly agreed as to the object of it  all--the love of studying rather than destroying the game, the love of  the pursuit itself.    They angle because of its healthfulness, and the consequent  exhilaration of mind and body that attends the gentle practice, not  merely for the fishes it may procure them, or for the sake of killing  something, as the unenlightened person charges, for the death of an  animal, to the Angler, is the saddest incident of his day.    All things animate, man included, were made to kill and to be killed.  The only crimes in killing are in killing our own kind, and in killing  any kind inhumanly.    And, of all creatures, the Angler is the least offender in these  crimes. The very game he seeks, though beautiful and gentle to the  eye, and, at times, noble in deed and purpose, is the most brutal  killer of all the races--the lovely trout in its attacks upon gaudy  flies, the valiant bass and pike in devouring their smaller brethren,  and the multitudinous sea-fishes, not alone in their feeding upon one  another, but in their wanton murder of the millions upon millions of  victims of their pure love of slaughter.    But, of fly-fishing for brook trout:    \"Fly-fishing,\" says Dr. Henshall, \"is the poetry of angling\"; and \"the  genuine Angler,\" says Frederick Pond, \"is invariably a poet.\"    Fly-fishing, the highest order of angling, is indulged in in several  forms--in fresh water for salmon, trout, black bass, grayling, perch,  pike-perch, pickerel (Long Island brook pickerel), sunfish, roach,  dace, shad, herring (branch), etc.; in brackish water for shad, trout,  white perch, etc.; and in salt water for bluefish (young), herring  (common), mackerel, and--doubt not, kind sir, for I am prepared to  prove it--squeteague (weakfish), plaice (fluke, summer flounder), and  other species of both bottom and surface habitats--another \"endless  field for argument, speculation, and experiment.\"    As there are many forms of fly-fishing, so are there many ways of  fly-fishing for trout, and many kinds of trout, the various forms of  brook trout, lake trout, and sea trout.    Volumes would be required to discourse intelligently upon all these  forms of trout and fly-fishing for them; so I purpose in this  particular instance to confine myself to one species and one form of  trout and one order of fly-fishing.    The trout referred to is the true brook trout, scientifically alluded  to as _Salvelinus fontinalis_ and commonly called, besides brook trout  (its most popular name), speckled trout, mountain trout, speckled  beauty, spotted trout, etc.    The fly-fishing treated of is that popular form that is most indulged  in by the Eastern trout fly-fisherman--small-stream fishing in the  mountains and wooded level lands that \"carries us,\" as Davy wrote as  far away as 1828, \"into the most wild and beautiful scenery of nature  to the clear and lovely streams that gush from the high ranges of  elevated hills.\"    Above all other styles of fly-fishing, it calls for the most delicate  tackle and the very daintiest hand.    \"How delightful,\" says the author of _Salmonia_, \"in the early spring,  after the dull and tedious time of winter, when the frosts disappear  and the sunshine warms the earth and waters, to wander forth by some  clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent  the odors of the bank perfumed by the violet, and enameled, as it  were, with the primrose and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf  below the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the  music of the bee; and on the surface of the waters to view the gaudy  flies sparkling like animated gems in the sunbeams, whilst the bright  and beautiful trout is watching them from below; to hear the  twittering of the water-birds, who, alarmed at your approach, rapidly  hide themselves beneath the flowers and leaves of the water-lily; and,  as the season advances, to find all these objects changed for others  of the same kind, but better and brighter, till the swallow and the  trout contend as it were for the May fly, and till in pursuing your  amusement in the calm and balmy evening you are serenaded by the songs  of the cheerful thrush, performing the offices of paternal love in  thickets ornamented with the rose and woodbine.\"    The other forms of fly-fishing for trout, the pursuit of larger  specimens of the same species in larger waters, the lakes and ponds  and rivers--all equally inviting by their gentle requirements and the  \"beautiful scenery of nature\"--deserve special treatment, because, as  in fly-fishing for salmon (_salmo salar_), the very top notch of all  forms of angling, the play, the player, the scenes, and the  accessories are sufficiently different to confound the reader I am  mainly endeavoring to amuse with these particular lines.    Small stream fly-fishing for brook trout belongs in a class just  between fly-fishing for the brook trout of broader waters, the lakes  and ponds, and fly-fishing for salmon in the lordly rivers of Maine  and Canada.    The brook trout is angled for in the spring and summer, principally  with the artificial fly, and by the chivalric Angler only with the  artificial fly, though many greedy fishermen of trifling experience  and wholly deprived of the true spirit of angling--in that they fish  for the fish alone and judge their day and play solely by the size of  their catch--contrive to convince us that the live lure is equally  honorable, notwithstanding that the cruel, clumsy, uncleanly, unfair,  wasteful practice of live-bait trout fishing is condemned by every  truly gentle disciple and practical authority.    Most advocates of live-bait trout fishing, who would have us believe  that their method is entitled to recognition in the same category with  fly-fishing, proudly proclaim that this should be because they \"can  catch more fish with the worm or minnow than the Angler can catch with  his fly.\"    If this reasoning is to settle the debate, if killing and quantity  compose the Angler's axiom, why not resort to still more productive  means--dynamite, or net the stream instead of gently fishing it?    No, the trout fly-fisherman abhors trout bait-fishing for the same  reason the wing shot prefers his appropriate arm to a cannon; the  yachtsman, his gentle craft to a man-o'-war; the horseman, his trained  mount to a locomotive; the archer, his arrow instead of a harpoon; and  so I might go on in similes that would burlesque every form of  recreative amusement in the world.    The brook trout breeds in the autumn, favors eddies, riffles, pools,  and deep spots under the banks of the stream, and near rocks and  fallen trees, and feeds on flies, small fish, worms, and other small  life forms.    Its shape, weight, size, and color are influenced by its food, its  age, its activity, its habitat, and its habits. Its color corresponds  to the color of the water bottom and will change as the water bottom  changes. If removed to a new water, where the bottom color is  different from the bottom color of its first abode--lighter or darker,  as the case may be,--it will gradually grow to a corresponding shade,  blending with its new habitat just as its colors suited the stones  and grasses and earthy materials of its native domain.    In weight, the brook trout ranges up to ten pounds in large waters.  There is a record of one weighing eleven pounds.

Unmoved by the calls of ambition, which might  have tempted him to some one great and engrossing effort, his aim has  been the general good of the people.    The following extract from the dedication, to his pupils, of his  _Addresses and Miscellaneous Writings_, evinces something of his  purpose:    \"It is now five-and-twenty years since I adopted the resolution never to  refuse to attempt anything consistent with my professional duties, in  the cause of learning, or religion, which I might be invited to do. This  resolution I have not at any time regretted, and perhaps I may say, I  have not essentially violated it. However this may be, I have never  suffered from want of something to do.\"    Professor Haddock's style is remarkable for purity and correctness. His  sentences are all finished sentences, never subject to an injurious  verbal criticism, without a mistake of any kind, or a grammatical error.    We have not written of Dr. Haddock as a politician; but he is a  thoroughly informed statesman, profoundly versed in public law, and  familiar with all the policy and aims of the American government. He is  of course a Whig. He has been educated, politically, in the school of  his illustrious uncle, and probably no man living is more thoroughly  acquainted with Mr. Webster's views, or more capable of their  application in affairs. It is therefore eminently suitable that he  should be on the list of our representatives abroad, while the foreign  department is under Mr. Webster's administration. The Whig party in New  Hampshire have not been insensible of Dr. Haddock's surpassing  abilities, of his sagacity, or his merits. Could they have done so, they  would have made him Governor, or a senator in Congress, on any of the  occasions in many years in which such officers have been chosen.  Considered without reference to party, we can think of no gentleman in  the country who would be likely to represent the United States more  worthily at foreign courts, or who by his capacities, suavity of manner,  or honorable nature, would make a more pleasing and desirable impression  upon the most highly cultivated society. Those who know him well will  assent to the justness of a classification which places him in the same  list of intellectual diplomats which embraces Bunsen, Guizot, and our  own Everett, Irving, Bancroft and Marsh.      [Illustration: No. I.--WINGED HUMAN-HEADED BULL.]    DR. LAYARD'S RECENT GIFTS FROM NIMROUD.    The researches of no antiquary or traveler in modern times have excited  so profound an interest as those of Austen Henry Layard, who has  summoned the kings and people of Nineveh through three thousand years to  give their testimony against the skeptics of our age in support of the  divine revelation. In a former number of _The International_ we  presented an original and very interesting letter from Dr. Layard  himself, upon the nature and bearing of his discoveries. Since then he  has sent to London, where they have arrived in safety, several of the  most important sculptures described in his work republished here last  year by Mr. Putnam. Among them are the massive and imposing statues of a  human-headed bull and a human-headed lion, of which we have engravings  in some of the London journals. The _Illustrated London News_ describes  these specimens of ancient art as follows:    \"No. I. is the Human-Headed and Eagle-Winged Bull. This animal would  seem to bear some analogy to the Egyptian sphynx, which represents the  head of the King upon the body of the lion, and is held by some to be  typical of the union of intellectual power with physical strength. The  sphynx of the Egyptians, however, is invariably sitting, whereas the  Nimroud figure is always represented standing. The apparent resemblance  being so great, it is at least worthy of consideration whether the head  on the winged animals of the Ninevites may not be that of the King, and  the intention identical with that of the sphynx; though we think it more  probable that there is no such connection, and that the intention of the  Ninevites was to typify their god under the common emblems of  intelligence, strength and swiftness, as signified by the additional  attributes of the bird. The specimen immediately before us is of gypsum,  and of colossal dimensions, the slab being ten feet square by two feet  in thickness. It was situated at the entrance of a chamber, being built  into the side of the door, so that one side and a front view only could  be seen by the spectator. Accordingly, the Ninevite sculptor, in order  to make both views perfect, has given the animal five legs. The four  seen in the side view show the animal in the act of walking; while, to  render the representation complete in the front view, he has repeated  the right fore leg again, but in the act of standing motionless. The  countenance is noble and benevolent in expression; the features are of  true Persian type; he wears an egg-shaped cap, with three horns and a  cord round the base of it. The hair at the back of the head has seven  ranges of curls; and the beard, as in the portraits of the King, is  divided into three ranges of curls, with intervals of wavy hair. In the  ears, which are those of a bull, are pendent ear-rings. The whole of the  dewlap is covered with tiers of curls, and four rows are continued  beneath the ribs along the whole flank; on the back are six rows of  curls, and upon the haunch a square bunch, ranged successively, and down  the back of the thigh four rows. The hair at the end of the tail is  curled like the beard, with intervals of wavy hair. The hair at the knee  joints is likewise curled, terminating in the profile views of the limbs  in a single curl of the kind (if we may use the term) called _croche  coeur_. The elaborately sculptured wings extend over the back of the  animal to the very verge of the slab. All the flat surface of the slab  is covered with cuneiform inscription; there being twenty-two lines  between the fore legs, twenty-one lines in the middle, nineteen lines  between the hind legs, and forty-seven lines between the tail and the  edge of the slab. The whole of this slab is unbroken, with the exception  of the fore-feet, which arrived in a former importation, but which are  now restored to their proper place.    [Illustration: No. II.--WINGED HUMAN-HEADED LION.]    \"No. II. represents the Human-Headed and Winged Lion--nine feet long,  and the same in height; and in purpose and position the same as the  preceding, which, however, it does not quite equal in execution. In this  relievo we have the same head, with the egg-shaped three-horned  head-dress, exactly like that of the bull; but the ear is human, and not  that of a lion. The beard and hair of the head are even yet more  elaborately curled than the last; but the hair on the legs and sides of  the animal represents that shaggy appendage of the animal. Round the  loins is a succession of numerous cords, which are drawn into four  separate knots; at the extremities are fringes, forming as many distinct  tassels. At the end of the tail, the claw--on which we commented in a  former article--is distinctly visible. The strength of both animals is  admirably and characteristically conveyed. Upon the flat surface of this  slab, as in the last, is a cuneiform inscription; twenty lines being  between the fore legs, twenty-six in the middle, eighteen between the  hind legs, and seventy-one at the back.\"    On the subject of Eastern languages, an understanding of which is  necessary to the just apprehension of these inscriptions, that most  acute antiquary, Major Rawlinson, remarks:    \"My own impression is that hundreds of the languages at one time current  through Asia are now utterly lost; and it is not, therefore, to be  expected that philologists or ethnologists will ever succeed in making  out a genealogical table of language, and in affiliating all the various  dialects. Coming to the Assyrian and Babylonian languages, we were first  made acquainted with them as translations of the Persian and Parthian  documents in the trilingual inscriptions of Persia; but lately we have  had an enormous amount of historical matter brought to light in tablets  of stone written in these languages alone. The languages in question I  certainly consider to be Semitic. I doubt whether we could trace at  present in any of the buildings or inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia  the original primitive civilization of man--that civilization which took  place in the very earliest ages. I am of opinion that civilization first  showed itself in Egypt after the immigration of the early tribes from  Asia. I think that the human intellect first germinated on the Nile, and  that then there was, in a later age, a reflux of civilization from the  Nile back to Asia. I am quite satisfied that the system of writing in  use on the Tigris and Euphrates was taken from the Nile; but I admit  that it was carried to a much higher state of perfection in Assyria than  it had ever reached in Egypt. The earliest Assyrian inscriptions were  those lately discovered by Mr. Layard in the north-west Palace at  Nimroud, being much earlier than anything found at Babylon. Now, the  great question is the date of these inscriptions. Mr. Layard himself,  when he published his book on Nineveh, believed them to be 2500 years  before the Christian era; but others, and Dr. Hincks among the number,  brought them down to"]]]
