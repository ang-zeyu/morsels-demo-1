Again; after he opens his eyes, and contemplates the world as it really  is, it would be impossible for him at first to assign the cause of any  one event, much less of the whole of things, or of the universe. He might  set his fancy a rambling; and she might bring him in an infinite variety  of reports and representations. These would all be possible; but being  all equally possible, he would never of himself give a satisfactory  account for his preferring one of them to the rest. Experience alone can  point out to him the true cause of any phenomenon.    Now, according to this method of reasoning, DEMEA, it follows, (and is,  indeed, tacitly allowed by CLEANTHES himself,) that order, arrangement,  or the adjustment of final causes, is not of itself any proof of design;  but only so far as it has been experienced to proceed from that  principle. For aught we can know a priori, matter may contain the source  or spring of order originally within itself, as well as mind does; and  there is no more difficulty in conceiving, that the several elements,  from an internal unknown cause, may fall into the most exquisite  arrangement, than to conceive that their ideas, in the great universal  mind, from a like internal unknown cause, fall into that arrangement. The  equal possibility of both these suppositions is allowed. But, by  experience, we find, (according to CLEANTHES), that there is a difference  between them. Throw several pieces of steel together, without shape or  form; they will never arrange themselves so as to compose a watch. Stone,  and mortar, and wood, without an architect, never erect a house. But the  ideas in a human mind, we see, by an unknown, inexplicable economy,  arrange themselves so as to form the plan of a watch or house.  Experience, therefore, proves, that there is an original principle of  order in mind, not in matter. From similar effects we infer similar  causes. The adjustment of means to ends is alike in the universe, as in a  machine of human contrivance. The causes, therefore, must be resembling.    I was from the beginning scandalised, I must own, with this resemblance,  which is asserted, between the Deity and human creatures; and must  conceive it to imply such a degradation of the Supreme Being as no sound  Theist could endure. With your assistance, therefore, DEMEA, I shall  endeavour to defend what you justly call the adorable mysteriousness of  the Divine Nature, and shall refute this reasoning of CLEANTHES, provided  he allows that I have made a fair representation of it.    When CLEANTHES had assented, PHILO, after a short pause, proceeded in the  following manner.    That all inferences, CLEANTHES, concerning fact, are founded on  experience; and that all experimental reasonings are founded on the  supposition that similar causes prove similar effects, and similar  effects similar causes; I shall not at present much dispute with you. But  observe, I entreat you, with what extreme caution all just reasoners  proceed in the transferring of experiments to similar cases. Unless the  cases be exactly similar, they repose no perfect confidence in applying  their past observation to any particular phenomenon. Every alteration of  circumstances occasions a doubt concerning the event; and it requires new  experiments to prove certainly, that the new circumstances are of no  moment or importance. A change in bulk, situation, arrangement, age,  disposition of the air, or surrounding bodies; any of these particulars  may be attended with the most unexpected consequences: And unless the  objects be quite familiar to us, it is the highest temerity to expect  with assurance, after any of these changes, an event similar to that  which before fell under our observation. The slow and deliberate steps of  philosophers here, if any where, are distinguished from the precipitate  march of the vulgar, who, hurried on by the smallest similitude, are  incapable of all discernment or consideration.    But can you think, CLEANTHES, that your usual phlegm and philosophy have  been preserved in so wide a step as you have taken, when you compared to  the universe houses, ships, furniture, machines, and, from their  similarity in some circumstances, inferred a similarity in their causes?  Thought, design, intelligence, such as we discover in men and other  animals, is no more than one of the springs and principles of the  universe, as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion, and a hundred  others, which fall under daily observation. It is an active cause, by  which some particular parts of nature, we find, produce alterations on  other parts. But can a conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred  from parts to the whole? Does not the great disproportion bar all  comparison and inference? From observing the growth of a hair, can we  learn any thing concerning the generation of a man? Would the manner of a  leaf's blowing, even though perfectly known, afford us any instruction  concerning the vegetation of a tree?    But, allowing that we were to take the operations of one part of nature  upon another, for the foundation of our judgement concerning the origin  of the whole, (which never can be admitted,) yet why select so minute, so  weak, so bounded a principle, as the reason and design of animals is  found to be upon this planet? What peculiar privilege has this little  agitation of the brain which we call thought, that we must thus make it  the model of the whole universe? Our partiality in our own favour does  indeed present it on all occasions; but sound philosophy ought carefully  to guard against so natural an illusion.    So far from admitting, continued PHILO, that the operations of a part can  afford us any just conclusion concerning the origin of the whole, I will  not allow any one part to form a rule for another part, if the latter be  very remote from the former. Is there any reasonable ground to conclude,  that the inhabitants of other planets possess thought, intelligence,  reason, or any thing similar to these faculties in men? When nature has  so extremely diversified her manner of operation in this small globe, can  we imagine that she incessantly copies herself throughout so immense a  universe? And if thought, as we may well suppose, be confined merely to  this narrow corner, and has even there so limited a sphere of action,  with what propriety can we assign it for the original cause of all  things? The narrow views of a peasant, who makes his domestic economy the  rule for the government of kingdoms, is in comparison a pardonable  sophism.    But were we ever so much assured, that a thought and reason, resembling  the human, were to be found throughout the whole universe, and were its  activity elsewhere vastly greater and more commanding than it appears in  this globe; yet I cannot see, why the operations of a world constituted,  arranged, adjusted, can with any propriety be extended to a world which  is in its embryo state, and is advancing towards that constitution and  arrangement. By observation, we know somewhat of the economy, action, and  nourishment of a finished animal; but we must transfer with great caution  that observation to the growth of a foetus in the womb, and still more to  the formation of an animalcule in the loins of its male parent. Nature,  we find, even from our limited experience, possesses an infinite number  of springs and principles, which incessantly discover themselves on every  change of her position and situation. And what new and unknown principles  would actuate her in so new and unknown a situation as that of the  formation of a universe, we cannot, without the utmost temerity, pretend  to determine.    A very small part of this great system, during a very short time, is very  imperfectly discovered to us; and do we thence pronounce decisively  concerning the origin of the whole?    Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick, iron, brass, have not, at this  time, in this minute globe of earth, an order or arrangement without  human art and contrivance; therefore the universe could not originally  attain its order and arrangement, without something similar to human art.  But is a part of nature a rule for another part very wide of the former?  Is it a rule for the whole? Is a very small part a rule for the universe?  Is nature in one situation, a certain rule for nature in another  situation vastly different from the former?    And can you blame me, CLEANTHES, if I here imitate the prudent reserve of  SIMONIDES, who, according to the noted story, being asked by HIERO,  What God was? desired a day to think of it, and then two days more; and  after that manner continually prolonged the term, without ever bringing  in his definition or description? Could you even blame me, if I had  answered at first, that I did not know, and was sensible that this  subject lay vastly beyond the reach of my faculties? You might cry out  sceptic and railler, as much as you pleased: but having found, in so many  other subjects much more familiar, the imperfections and even  contradictions of human reason, I never should expect any success from  its feeble conjectures, in a subject so sublime, and so remote from the  sphere of our observation. When two species of objects have always been  observed to be conjoined together, I can infer, by custom, the existence  of one wherever I see the existence of the other; and this I call an  argument from experience. But how this argument can have place, where the  objects, as in the present case, are single, individual, without  parallel, or specific resemblance, may be difficult to explain. And will  any man tell me with a serious countenance, that an orderly universe must  arise from some thought and art like the human, because we have  experience of it? To ascertain this reasoning, it were requisite that we  had experience of the origin of worlds; and it is not sufficient, surely,  that we have seen ships "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#5)"],[1,"part of people probably thought Stephen  deserved the punishment that terminated his life. The same might be  said of John the Baptist, who meddled with the matrimonial concerns  of those who did not acknowledge his ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The  prophet Elijah was designated to death because he troubled Israel.  Daniel refused lawful obedience to the established governor of the  realm. In short, persecutors in every age, have always had a plausible  pretext for their doings, in the popular estimation of their own day  and age.    You ask, \"By whom we are persecuted?\" In reply I could mention as  instigators of mobs, the names of a Baptist missionary, a Methodist  and Presbyterian minister. You may also be apprised that ex-Governor  Boggs, of Missouri, made affidavit that Joseph Smith was accessory to  an attempt to murder him; and that Governor Carlin, of Illinois, in  the face of superabundant testimony and law, gave a warrant to arrest  him (Joseph Smith) on that affidavit. A heavy reward has been offered  for his apprehension, and bold menaces are occasionally hung over our  heads, that we, as a people, shall be driven from the State. These  things have a tendency to check our prosperity. In one instance some  of our brethren were kidnapped by Missourians from this State, and put  to shame and scourging. The malignant and vexatious lawsuits to which  our people have been subject, are exceedingly numerous; and owing to  our impoverished condition, rendered sometimes distressing. But none  of these things move us, because we know that if they have hated the  master, they will also hate the disciples. Such as are born of the bond  woman, will persecute them that are born of the free woman. But it  seems like a discouraging effort, to attempt to convince our opposers  that we are persecuted, because editors and other philanthropic men are  reluctant to tell to the public our side of the matter. They themselves  would thereby become suspected of espousing our cause. Men are so  sensitive on the subject of our religion, that whoever speaks peaceably  of it, perils his influence and reputation; but hireling editors and  priests will speak and publish against us.    You ask me to give an account of the faith which I have embraced. I  believe that Jesus Christ is God, co-eternal with God the Father; and  that such as have the knowledge of the gospel and believe upon him,  will be saved; and such as believe not, will be damned. I believe the  Old and New Testaments to be the word of God. I believe that every  person should be born, not only of the spirit, but also of the water,  in order to enter into the kingdom of God. There are three that bear  witness on earth, as there are three that bear record in heaven--the  spirit, the water, and the blood, bear concurrent testimony to our  obedience on earth; for the want of any one, or all of these witnesses  on earth, in our favour, there will be no registry of our perfect  acceptance in heaven. Hence the baptism for the dead. The righteous  dead have a merciful provision made for them in the testimony of the  three witnesses on earth, which secures a record of their perfect  acceptance in heaven, without which they cannot attain to the highest  glory. I believe in the resurrection of the dead, the righteous to life  eternal, and the wicked to shame and everlasting contempt. I believe  that repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, are  among the elementary and cardinal truths of the gospel.    In some, and, indeed, many respects do we differ from sectarian  denominations. We believe that God is a being that has both body and  parts, and also passions; also in the existence of the gifts in the  true church spoken of in St. Paul's letter to the Corinthians.    I believe that every church, in gospel order, has a priesthood,  consisting of prophets, apostles, elders, &c., and that the knowledge  and power of a priesthood, ordained of God, as the ancient priesthood  was, is indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the church. I do  not believe that the canon of sacred scripture was closed with the  revelation of John, but believe that wherever God has a true church,  there he makes frequent revelations of his will: and as God takes  cognizance of all things, both temporal and spiritual, his revelations  will pertain to all things whereby his glory may be promoted, and  the temporal and spiritual well-being of his people advanced. Any  people that are destitute of the teachings of prophets and apostles,  which come by immediate revelation, will soon fall into divisions and  strifes, and depart from the truth as it is in Jesus.    You wish to know, \"What is the personal character and influence,  doctrines and claims of him who is called the leader, Joseph Smith?\"  Joseph Smith, when the great designs of heaven were first made known  to him, was not far from the age of seventeen; from that time to this  he has had much said about him, both of a favourable and unfavourable  nature. I shall only speak of his character as I believe it to be from  an intimate acquaintance of more than one year, and from an intimate  acquaintance with those who have been with him many years. No man is  more narrowly watched by friends and enemies than Mr. Joseph Smith;  consequently, if he were as good a man as any prophet that has preceded  him, he would have as violent enemies as others have had. But I hasten  to give my own opinion.    I firmly avow, in the presence of God, that I believe Mr. Joseph Smith  to be an upright man, that seeks the glory of God in such a manner  as is well pleasing to the Most High God. Naturally he is kind and  obliging; pitiful and courteous; as far from dissimulation as any man;  frank and loquacious to all men, friends or foes. He seems to employ  no studied effort to guard himself against misrepresentation, but  often leaves himself exposed to misconstructions by those who watch  for faults. He is remarkably cheerful for one who has seen well-tried  friends martyred around him, and felt the inflictions of calumny--the  vexation of lawsuits--the treachery of intimates--and multiplied  violent attempts upon his person and life, together with the cares  of much business. His influence, after which you inquire, is very  great. His friends are as ardently attached to him as his enemies are  violently opposed. Free toleration is given to all opposing religions,  but wherever he is accredited as a prophet of the living God, there  you will perceive his influence must be great. That lurking fear and  suspicion that he may become a dictator or despot, gradually gives  place to confidence and fondness, as believers become acquainted with  him.    In doctrine, Mr. Smith is eminently scriptural. I have never known him  to deny or depreciate a single truth of the Old and New Testaments,  but I have always known him to explain and defend them in a masterly  manner. Being anointed of God, for the purpose of teaching and  perfecting the church, it is needful that he should know how to set  in order the things that are wanting, and to bring forth things new  and old, as a scribe well instructed. This office and apostleship he  appears to magnify; at his touch the ancient prophets spring into life,  and the beauty and power of their revelations are made to commend  themselves with thrilling interest to all that hear.    You inquire, \"Does he claim to be inspired?\" Certainly he does claim to  be inspired. He often speaks in the name of the Lord, which would be  rank hypocrisy and mockery, if he were not inspired to do it. It seems  very difficult for those who stand at the distance of many generations  from the true prophets, to realize what prophets are, and what ought  to be expected from them. I do not chide them for their ignorance  and folly, however, because I have nothing to boast of, previous  to embracing the faith of the Latter-day Saints. I understand that  prophets may speak as they are moved by the Holy Ghost at one time,  while they may be very far from being moved by the Holy Ghost as they  speak at another. They may be endowed with power to perform miracles  and mighty deeds at one time, while they have no authority, and there  is no suitableness in doing the same at another time.    You ask, \"Is he a man of prayer, of a pure life, of peace? Does he  appear at the head of his troops as a military commander?\" These  questions I answer, according to the best knowledge I have, in the  affirmative. As a people, we perform military duty as the laws of the  State of Illinois enjoin and require. The legion answers the purpose  to keep the lawless and mobocratic at a respectful distance; and the  more \"earthquake and storm\" our enemies raise about the Nauvoo Legion,  and a military chieftain like the ancient Mahomet, the greater fear and  dread of us will be conveyed to the minds of the lawless, who watch for  prey, and spoil, and booty. I can assure you, that neither Mr. Smith,  nor any other intelligent Latter-day Saint, ever intends to make one  convert by the sword; neither are we such tee-total peacemakers, that  any savage banditti of lawless depredators could waste our property,  violate virtue, and shed innocent blood, without experiencing from us a  firm defence of law, of right, and innocence. We are to this day very  sensitive to a repetition of past wrongs that we still smart under. The  Lord our God, who was once called (by a man after his own heart) \"a  man of war,\" we trust will be our defence and strong tower in the day  of battle, if our country should ever call us to scenes of carnage and  blood.    You ask, \"What is the nature of the worship among you, and wherein  does it differ from that of religious people with whom you have been  acquainted elsewhere?\" On the sabbath some person usually preaches a  sermon after prayer and singing, and, perhaps, reading some scripture.  We have, also, frequent prayer meetings, in which "]]]
