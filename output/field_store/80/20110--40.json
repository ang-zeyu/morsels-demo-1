I walked over to where Uncle Nathan was standing and stopped in the  little furrows of brown earth. Already a thick coat of dust had formed  on my shoes.    \"Uncle Nathan,\" I said, \"I'd like to have a brief chat with you about  slavery days, if you can spare a few minutes from your garden here?\"    \"Yassuh, boss,\" he said, punctuating his reply with a spat of tobacco  that was soon nothing but a dark mark in the parched ground, \"glad to be  of any 'sistance.\"    We moved to the shade of a large oak where we sat down together on a  sturdy, home-made bench.    \"Well, white folks,\" he went on after taking a long turn at the dipper  hanging on the tree which shades a well. \"I'll tell you a story of my  mammy an' pappy. Nathan Beauchamp, my pappy, belonged to Massa Green  Beauchamp at White Oak Springs, near Eufaula.    Massa Green was a member of de legislature when de capital was at  Tuscaloosy. He had many a acre of land an' hund'eds of slaves. Pappy use  to dribe de wagon in to Eufaula to git supplies an' on de way he would  meet up wid an Injun gal a-carryin' big baskets dat she was a goin' to  sell dere. He would ask her iffen she wanted to ride, an' she always say  yes. So one day pappy came to de massa and tell him dat dere was an  Injun gal on de St. Francis Indian Village dat he wanted fo' a wife, an'  de boss say all right so pappy married de Indian gal. Her name was Mimi.  So I is half nigger an half Injun. My mammy died 'bout five year after  freedom, but I can remembers dat she had long black hair, and I  remembers de way de sun sparkle on her teeth when she smile. Atter she  married pappy, she still carried her pretty baskets to Eufaula to sell.  Sometime she walk all de way dere and back, twenty fo' miles. I been  libin' here in Eufaula fifty year or mo', white fo'ks, an' I owns my  little cabin an' de lan' around it. T'ain't much, but its enough to keep  me a-goin', dis wid de little sto' I owns.\"          Oliver Bell          *Interview with Oliver Bell*      --_Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston_    _DE BES' FRIEND A NIGGER EVER HAD_    Oliver Bell says the first thing he remembers was seeing his mother  whipped. He was born in slavery, but most of his knowledge of the evils,  as well as the joys of ante-bellum days, is by hearsay only.    \"I was borned on de De Graffenreid Place,\" he said, \"nine miles west of  Livingston-Boyd Road. My mother was Luella De Graffenreid an' my pappy  was Edmund De Graffenreid. Den dey changed my name to Bell. I had one  brother, Nat, an' two sisters, Jestina an' Clara. I has 'bout sixteen  chilluns, all born on de same place an' most of dem is livin' dere yit.  My chillun by my firs' wife are Ed, Jack, Holly, Buck, Clarence, Sally,  Liza, Mag an' Luella. Dey ma was Mandy Powell, frum York. Den my second  wife, Bettie Brown, gived me de res' of my chilluns. Le's see, dey is  Jimmy, J.W. Alfonso Wallace, Henry, Edna an' ----\" He hesitated,  explained, \"Dat's as many as I kin' 'member jest now.    [Illustration: _Oliver Bell, Livingston, Alabama_]    \"My gran'ma's name was Cely De Graffenreid an' my gran'pa's name was  Peter. He was a shoemaker fur de place an' made plows, too. He was a  worker an' he learnt me how to pull fodder an' chop corn an' cotton when  I was jest a little scamp jes' a little black nigger.    \"Us all b'longed to Mr. Tresvan De Graffenreid an' Mistus Rebecca; an'  dey was all good to us. Ol' Mistus read de Bible to us an' got us  baptized in de river at Horn's bridge, but dat was atter de surrender.  In slavery times dey didn't like for us to sing an play loud in de  quarters. Honey, I 'members when us had de big prayer meetin's. Dey  would shut de door so de voice won't git out, an' dey would turn de  washpot down de door. Dat was to keep de voice inside, dey tol' me.\"    Oliver mused a moment, recalling the old times.    \"Us chilluns useta have a good time singin' an' a-playin',\" he said. \"I  'members one of our little verses run somethin' lak dis:        Shoo, shoo, shoo gander      Th'ow yo' feathers 'way yander.    \"Us had ol' corn hollers, too, but I fergits um now. I does remember  though you could hear dem niggers holler a whole mile.    \"No'm, it warn't so bad wid us. De white folks was good to us niggers.  Us had 'nough to eat, lak greens, frum de big house. Us had our rations  weighted out; peck o' meal, three pounds of meat, half gallon of  'lasses, made at home in wodden mills; an' dat was for a week. An'  sometimes, on a Sunday us had a little sugar, coffee an' flour. No'm, us  didn't know what rice was.    \"What I seed of slavery was a bad idea, I reckon, but ev'ybody thought  dey marster was de bes' in de lan'. Us didn't know no better. A man was  growed plum' green 'fo he knew de whole worl' didn't belong to his ol'  marster.    \"Us didn't have no bought medicine in dem days; jes' whut us got outta  de woods lak slippery ellum fer fever an' poke salad root; dey he'p a  lot. An' May-apple root would he'p you same as castor oil.    \"Didn't nobody he'p us learn nothin' much, but mos' of my chilluns went  to Booker T's school. Dey say he's a mighty smart man, an' my chilluns  thinks so, too. It's all right; I wish I could read an' write; den I'd  tell you things you'd lak to know.\"    His face clouded for the briefest moment.    \"I tell you de fust thing I 'members, an' I don't know whut started it.  One day my mammy done sumpin' an' ol' marster made her pull her dress  down 'roun' her waist an' made her lay down 'crost de door. Den he taken  a leather strop an' whooped her. I 'members dat I started cryin' an'  Mistus Beckie said, 'Go git dat boy a biskit.'    \"I reckerlecks my mammy was a plow han' an' she'd go to work soon an'  put me under de shade of a big ol' post-oak tree. Dere I sat all day,  an' dat tree was my nurse. It still standin' dere yit, an' I won't let  nobody cut it down.    \"Mammy say I never did learn to walk; jes' one day she sot me down under  de oak, an' fust thing she knowed she look up an' dere I was walkin'  down de middle of a cotton row.    \"'Nother thing I 'members when I was a little boy; dat dey was 'vidin'  de corn atter de s'render. Dr. DeGraffenreid measured de corn out to all  of 'em whut was share han's. He'd take a bushel an' give 'em a bushel.  When he mos' through he'd throw a ear of corn to dis one, an' give  himse'f a ear; den he break a ear in two, an' he take part an' give dem  part. Dat was close measurin', I tell you.    \"Us lived in de third house frum de big house in de quarter, an' when I  was a boy it was my job to set out shade trees. An' one day de Ku Klux  come ridin' by an' dey leader was Mister Steve Renfroe. (Alabama bandit  of Reconstruction days). He wore long hair an' he call my pappy out an'  ax him a heap of questions. While he sittin' dere his horse pull up nigh  'bout all de trees I done sot out.    \"Atter talkin' to my pappy, he rode on 'cross Horn's bridge, 'bout two  miles souf of here, an' dere he met Ol' Man Enoch Sledge an' Frank  Sledge. Dey was darkies whut b'longed to Marsa Simmy Sledge's father,  Ol' Doctor Sledge. Slaves on dat plantation was 'lowed pretty good  privilege atter de s'rrender an' was workin' on halvens. Uncle Enoch an'  Frank was in town tradin' some, an' Mr. Renfroe didn't want 'em to have  anything. When dey lef' town, dey pass de Ku Kluxes raght on de slough  bridge. Mister Renfroe ax Enoch to give him a piece of string to fix his  saddle wid; den shot him. Frank run to de river, but de Ku Kluxes  cotched him an' shot him, too.    \"De niggers went down to de river dat night an' got de bodies an' buried  'em in de ol' Travis graveyard. My mammy an' daddy is buried dere, too.    \"Didn' nobody do nothin' 'bout Mister Renfroe 'till he went on an' got  to messin' wid Marsa Simmy Sledge's things; stole a pair of mules an' de  white folks rambled atter him 'till dey foun' him in Linden. Dey got so  hot atter him dat he went to his camp in de flat woods down on Bear  Creek. Dem was skeery times, 'case dat man never had no mercy for  nobody.    \"Dey's a cave down by de burial grounds whut de slaves dug when dey run  away, an' Mister Renfroe stayed dere. It's on de river bank an' its dug  up. You digs an' starts low an' pushes de dirt out an' digs up an' makes  a big room up so de water won't git you. I knows whar dey's two of de  caves on de place; my cow fell in one yestidy.    \"When Ol' Marster Amos Travis come out here from Californy, he taken a  lakin' to me an' wanted me to leave t'other side of de place an' move  down dis side of de big house to take keer of dis swamp an' look atter  de han's. But I wanted a big house wid four rooms an' two brick  chimneys, an' I had to talk five years to git it. I's got some  rosebushes now dat was at de big house raght atter de s'rrender, an'  dey's growin' in my yard now.    \"Speakin' 'bout graveyard, I was passin' dere one night, ridin' on 'bout  midnight, an' sumpin' come draggin' a chain by me lak a dog. I got down  off'n my horse, but couldn't see nothin' wid no chain, so I got back on  de horse an' dere raght in front of me was a Jack-Me-Lantern wid de  brightes' light you ever seed. It was tryin' to lead me off, an' ev'y  time I'd git back in de road it would lead me off ag'in. You sho' will  git los' if you follow a Jack-Me-Lantern.    \"One of dem led a man down to de creek by dem double bridges; said he  foun' he was travelin' in de wrong direction, gittin' frum home stidder  clo'ster, so he jes' sit down under a tree an' waited 'til daylight. I  ain't skeered of nothin' but dem Jack-Me-Lanterns, but dey stirs you up  in yo' min' till you can't tell whar you's at; an' dey's so bright dey  nigh 'bout puts yo' eyes out. Dey is plenty of 'em over by de graveyard  raght over yonder whar all my white folks is buried, an' mammy an'  pappy, too.

Us had to haul water on a sled, wid a mule, from de  Friday place; dat's de onliest trouble us had. Sometime us had to tie up  fodder and 'tend to de hay in de field on Sunday.    \"I married fust a girl name Sarah, in 1878. Got three chillun by her.  She died. Not good for a man to live alone, de Lord say. I picked out  another Sarah, but called her Sallie. Us has had nine chillun. Three of  dese [TR: are] Sailor, Tera, and Monroe. Monroe lives on my place and  farms 'long side of me. Sam is in Detroit, Michigan; Henry in Flurida  (Florida).    \"When de Yankees come, what they do? They did them things they ought not  to have done and they left undone de things they ought to have done.  Yes, dat just 'bout tells it. One thing you might like to hear. Mistress  got all de money, de silver, de gold and de jewels, and got de well  digger to hide them in de bottom of de well. Them Yankees smart. When  they got dere, they asked for de ve'y things at de bottom of de well.  Mistress wouldn't tell. They held a court of 'quiry in de yard; called  slaves up, one by one, good many. Must have been a Judas 'mongst us.  Soon a Yankee was let down in de well, and all dat money, silver, gold,  jewelry, watches, rings, brooches, knives and forks, butter-dishes,  waters, goblets, and cups was took and carried 'way by a army dat seemed  more concerned 'bout stealin', than they was 'bout de Holy War for de  liberation of de poor African slave people. They took off all de hosses,  sheeps, cows, chickens, and geese, took de seine and de fishes they  caught, corn in crib, meat in smoke house, and everything. Marse General  Sherman said war was hell. It sho' was. Mebbe it was hell for some of  them Yankees when they come to die and give account of de deeds they  done in Sumter and Richland Counties.\"          Maria Jenkins          *Interview with Maria Jenkins, about 90 years old*      *64 Montague Street, Charleston, S.C.*      --_Martha S. Pinckney, Charleston, S.C._    Maria Jenkins, who is about ninety, is very nearly blind, and only by  quiet persistence can she be made to hear; once started, her mind is  clear. She shows no bitterness. Occasionally there are flashes of humor.  Her body is brawny, sturdy and well carried, considering her age.    Maria Jenkins was a daughter of Aaron Grant; her mother's name is Ellen  Grant, all of whom were owned by Mr. Hugh Wilson of Wadmalaw Island.    \"I b'long Wadmalaw. When de Yankee come I ole 'nuf for mind chillun, and  take um to de field. I go up to Maussa' house ebery day for de milk for  we; and dey give we clabba (clabber) and cow peas and ting out de  garden. We git ebery evening a bushel ob corn grind and hand ober to de  nurse, and him sift out de flour. Yes Mam. He done grind in de hand mill  in de barn yard--de stone mill. Dat been uh big mill too. And dey gib we  uh big piece ob meat--so--(measuring with hands) and sometime chicken.  Rachel cook in de big pot for we chillun, and he dip um out. (She here  explained the big ladle or dipper.) You know dem big ladle. We put um in  we pan. Yes, Ma'am, he name Rachel, and he lick we. We haffa love um or  she lick we.\" Her huge mouth was illumined by a humorous smile.    \"He teach me to wash de baby clean and put on he dipa (diaper), and if I  ain't do um good he konk my head.

The question  was repeated.    \"Him ain't no man, him my grand daughter, Ellen Jenkins. I raise him  from baby yes, she name Ellen. Him good to me; him help me ebery  minute.\"    \"Are all your people dead?\"    \"De whole nation dead,\" reflectively, \"De whole nation dead--Peggy  dead--Toby dead--all leaning on de Lord.\"    \"When dem boat come up de ribber, and he shoot, and shoot, de big gun,  dat been de awful time.

When asked what they did after the war, Maria raised her  hands and said:    \"After de wah we all come home, tank de Lord! tank de Lord!\"    \"But your master didn't have any money to care for you.\"    \"Haffa scrabble for yo'self.\" Said she.          Paul Jenkins          *Interview with Paul Jenkins, 70 years old*      *18 Belser's Alley, Columbia, S.C.*      --_Stiles M. Scruggs, Columbia, S.C._    _SON OF A SLAVE TELLS OF HIS FATHER'S POLITICAL EXPERIENCES_    Paul Jenkins, age seventy, living at 18 Belser's Alley, Columbia, S.C.,  is a son of Paul Jenkins, a former slave, who decided to endure the  burdens he had in Colleton County, South Carolina, after he was set free  in 1865, rather than to fly to other places he knew nothing of. There he  won the respect of the white folks and Negroes alike, was repeatedly  elected to office, and lived there happily to the end of his life.    Here the present Paul Jenkins takes up the story, with:    \"I was born in Colleton County in 1867. My daddy was in office when I  begin to recall things, and he keep in office, by the will of the  people, until I was nearly grown. My mammy, too, was a slave, when she  and daddy marry. She die when I was 'bout twelve years old, and my only  brother, Edgar, was goin' on ten. My daddy never marry again.    \"One day some white men come to see daddy long after mammy was gone, and  they say to daddy: 'Paul, when you gwine to jump the broomstick again?'  My daddy was the only one who not laugh when they say that. He reply: 'I  has no women in view and no weddin' dream in the back of my head. I has  decided a wicked woman am a big bother and a good woman am a bore. To my  way of thinkin', that is the only difference between them.' The white  folks not smile, but say: 'You'll see! Just wait 'til the right girl  come along.'    \"Daddy just seem to make friends of all the people 'bout him, and our  house, close to Smoak, was a big meetin' place most of the time.  Sometimes the visitors are all white men. But at other days the niggers  come and talk, tell funny tales, and laugh. Most of the meetin's at the  house was late at night, 'cause my daddy always go to his office at  Walterboro, on week days. People comin' and goin' there, all the time.  Daddy was sho' popular with the people, generally speakin'.    \"The biggest crowd I ever seen up to that time, was when General M.C.  Butler come to Walterboro in 1882, to speak. He had been United States  Senator since 1876, and was a candidate for re-election. General Butler  much pleased, that day, when many white leaders and daddy call at his  hotel and tell him that daddy had been asked by his neighbors to  introduce him. He say: 'Well, from what I hears, Paul Jenkins can do  that job as well as anybody in the State.' Then he pat daddy on the  shoulder.    \"At the speakin', daddy gets up, and the big crowd claps its hands for  joy, and laughs, too. Daddy not laugh much, just smile. Then he throw  back his shoulders and say:        General Butler, lak Moses, led us forth at last,      The barren wilderness he pass'd      Did on the very border stand      Of the bless'd Promise Land,      And from the misty mountain tops of his exalted wit,      Saw it himself and showed us it!    \"'That's why we am sendin' him back----'. That was all I hear. Daddy not  allowed to finish. The people riot with pleasure, and General Butler say  the tribute am de finest he ever hear, and smile at daddy sittin' there  on the platform with the other big folks. At another time, daddy has a  nigger lawyer runnin' 'gainst him for County Commissioner. The lawyer's  name was Amphibious McIver. They begin the campaign at Cottageville.  McIver speak first. Daddy follow, and begin with:        A bullfrog tied by its tail to a stump,      It rear and it croak, but it couldn't make a jump!    \"The white folks and the niggers clap, stamp, throw hats, and laugh;  finally, marchin' up to the table to grab daddy and carry him up the  street on their shoulders. He keep sayin': 'Boys, why don't you let me  finish my speech?' They would laugh and say: 'Paul, you done made de  best speech in de world!' Daddy win at the 'lection, in a big way.    \"My daddy learn to read, write, and cipher while he was a slave. The  Jenkins family help him, he say, 'cause he always keep the peace, and  work as he was told to do. When he's set free, that white family help  him get settled and loaned him books. He go to Charleston 'bout 1868 and  buy an armful of books and studied at night or whenever he had the  chance. That is why he was able to make the political races which he  make and profit by. He send me and my brother, Edgar, to school, so that  we learn a good deal in books. Edgar, he fidgitty lak, and decide he go  to Pennsylvania and make a fortune!    \"Edgar got work in a steel mill at Johnstown, soon after he got there,  and had considerable money, when he was sent to the hospital with  pneumonia. He pull through that sickness and go back to his job, but the  big flood come (May 31, 1889) and the girl he was to marry was among the  2,000 unknown people who was drowned, and he never has married--peculiar  lak our daddy, don't you think? I just been married to one. She is 68  and I's 70 and I may say we's through,"]]]
