They may  do this in a reasonably short time with another older, well trained  dog to show them how to find the tree and keep them out there, but  then take him out by himself and when Mr. 'Coon goes in the creek or  around an old pond or bog your young dog lacks experience and a  year's work or more.    Then there is the rabbit which he must be broken not to run, and a  dog can always find their tracks before he can a 'coon. Now here is  where the right kind of judgment must be used, as all dogs cannot be  handled alike, and one may spoil a pup in trying to break him from  rabbits. So taking everything into consideration, it is worth far  more to train a dog for a first class 'coon dog than most people  consider,--what it requires to train a dog, and what he should be  worth when properly broken.    Of course, it is not so much work to train a dog to run fox, as there  is generally a lot of fox dogs one can turn in with, and that way get  a young dog started and he will take to running them naturally.\"    I think a good dog, either a fox hound, or one that has never run  foxes, makes the best dog, altho curs or 'coon dogs are not to be  kicked out, that is if they are good, true hunters. I wouldn't advise  trying to train a hound with a cur unless he is an old 'coon dog. Try  and get your dog on a 'coon right in the start, and do not let him  fight too much the first time, unless he is an extra fighter. Do not  let your dog stay out hunting when the other dogs have treed a 'coon;  make him come in and bark up the tree. Always climb the tree for your  dog and get what he has, no matter if it takes until daylight.    When I own young dogs, I always train them myself. I never permit a  stranger to handle them. It is all right for strangers to handle the  old dogs once they are trained but the hunter who wishes to have good  dogs should train them himself or have a man who thoroughly  understands the proper way to use young dogs. It is a very easy  matter to spoil a dog when you do not know exactly how to proceed.      [Illustration: Capable Cross-bred Cooners.]    On the question of the proper age at which to begin training a hound,  a successful Minnesota trainer takes issue with those who advise  taking the pup to field at eight or ten months of age. He writes in  part: \"I disagree with those who advise the early initiation of the  pup. Any kind of fairly well bred pup will run, not only at 10  months, but at 5, 6 or 7 months, but the point to consider is, will a  dog put at hard work at such age, become a hardy one? Will he develop  himself as well as if he had been given a chance to grow some bones?  I say no; put a colt at hard work at 2 or 3 years old, will he ever  be the horse which he would have been, if he had only been broken at  4 or 5 years old? Every horse breeder knows that if he wants a good  roadster, he must give him a chance to grow, then he will not be  afraid to cover 60 or more miles in a day with that horse; not only  this but he will get many times the price for that horse as for his  brother which was put to work two years earlier. I have bred horses  and know of what I speak.    There are many reasons why a sportsman should not start to train his  dog to hunt before he is full grown, that is at least not until he is  12 to 15 months old. Before that age, a pup may have the will but he  has not the strength to cover the ground of an old dog. A man who has  a valuable pup should wait until he is capable to stand hardships,  and until he has also a good knowledge box. In allowing a pup of 6,  7, 8 or 10 months to hunt, he will learn more bad tricks than good  ones, such as to remain in the bush longer than necessary, and soon  become a long record dog. The risk is great that he will get lost, or  if not, will return with swollen feet and legs if he ran at all, also  be chilled and be rewarded with a fine dose of distemper. This is  often the cause why so many young dogs die with distemper or of some  other lingering death, but if a man gives time to his dog to develop  and get strong, the chance is, should he ever get distemper, it would  be but a slight attack from which he will soon recover.\"    We take it, however, that our well informed friend does not mean to  imply that a pup should not be taken afield and given a kindergarten  course earlier than a year old. His contention is, no doubt, that the  pup should not be permitted to over exert himself or to be thrown too  much on his own resources.      [Illustration: Good Catch in Which the Shepherd Dog Figured  Prominently.]        CHAPTER V.    TRAINING FOR SKUNK, OPOSSUM AND MINK.    All the foregoing has more or less application to the present topic.  We are still dealing with the nocturnal wanderers. Occasionally any  of the above may be discovered abroad in the full glare of day. Some  hunters successfully locate them, by the aid of dogs, in their dens  or burrows and capture them in the day-time. This is a cut and dried  operation that requires none of the resourceful tactics of man and  dog in the chase, and is, therefore, dismissed from the discussion.  Now, what are the dog's duties? The matter of still hunters vs.  tonguers, being of such variance of opinion, it will be discussed in  a subsequent and separate chapter.    Having impressed your dog with the fact that you want him to look out  for skunk, possum and mink, as well as 'coon, the next point of  importance is to insist on the dog staying with the quarry and  barking until you arrive; also not to take hold until the word is  given as the hide is apt to be all chewed up and full of holes if the  dog is too long and too vigorous in the task. Many hunters pick up  many of the skunk on the field, without even being touched by the  dogs.    In this connection a contributor writes: \"We walk right up to the  skunks and pick them up by the tails; then hit them on the head with  a club and kill them or put them in the bag and take them home alive,  as the occasion may suit.\"    \"Now I won't tell that I can catch skunks without getting scented,  but will say this, we have caught hundreds by the tail, and after  lifting them clear off the ground, never have been scented by them.  As I said before, I go for the business end of it, and am not afraid  to get some scent on me as long as I don't get it in my eyes. If you  get it in your eyes, it feels about as if you had horse-radish or hot  water in them for the next ten minutes, which is not altogether  pleasant.\"    The skunk is a foolish, unresourceful animal and were it not for its  natural, unique means of defense, would be utterly at the mercy of  dogs and hunters. Many dogs object to the scent and will trail and  bring to bay a skunk only with reluctance. Only those who hunt for  profit, care to take the skunk, and he must needs learn the finer  points by experience.    The Scotch Terrier and Beagle should be mink dog. The steel trap is  more generally relied upon to bag the sly mink and his capture with  dog and gun is oft-times very unproductive.      [Illustration: Opossums Are Easily Caught Alive for Training  Purposes.]    A Pennsylvania hunter contributes the following to the general fund:  a good cross for mink as well as rabbit. This combination gives the  requisite agility needed in coping with mink. Some even advise a  strain of water Spaniel with the above breed for ideal.    \"Before taking him out you can teach the young dog when 8 or 10  months old, what to do by catching an animal that you wish to train  your dog on and leading it around. If it is a 'coon or opossum, then  put up a tree or on a fence. Loose your dog and let him trail until  he finds it. Teach the dog to bark by hissing him on and clapping,  whooping to him and such like.    If for skunk, kill one and drag it around, place it out of pup's  reach, and teach him to bark when he comes upon his game. You can  teach the habit of tongueing after night or silence on the trail as  you prefer. Let your young dog shake and chew at the game you are  training him to hunt for. After he has found it and he fails to bark  by hissing him, tie a rope three feet long to it and keep throwing it  toward him and pulling it quickly away to teach him to grab at it and  hold on, and also bark. A live skunk generally gives a young dog such  a lesson the first time that he is always afraid of one afterwards,  unless he is an Irish terrier or bull dog or beagle crossed. These  two breeds are good ones for any kind of night hunting.    Take a live animal, a 'coon or something, and lead it past your young  dog's box where he is tied and let him see it and take notice how he  will want it, but all you want is to teach him the scent and how to  tongue when he comes up on the game. I believe what I have told will  generally break any dog.    A good dog, well broken to hunt 'coon, skunk or opossum is worth  scores of traps. Don't be afraid to switch a young dog some, to make  him learn good from bad, like tonguing track and rabbit. Always pet  him and be friendly after chastising him, and a good scolding with a  couple of light smacks with open hand will take the place of a  whipping. Don't use a stick unless necessary. Use judgment, the same  as you would want some one to use you, and in a few nights' training  your dog will be catching game. It is easy sailing after a few are  caught, and your dog is your greatest friend you have. He will make  you from $5.00 to $15.00 a night, where if you were trapping for the  same game, you would be lucky if you got a dollar's worth of fur, and  besides what is finer sport than a day's gunning, to hear your old  dog up on yonder hill or in some woods talking to you to come his  way?\"      [Illustration: North Dakota Wolf Hounds.]        CHAPTER VI.    WOLF AND COYOTE HUNTING.    In training a dog to run wolves, it is unsafe to allow a young dog to  go alone, as some wolves prefer fighting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34294"],[0,"Birds Illustrated (#5)"],[1," that, but as I have never been to school, you know, I can't  very well count backward. I can move forward, however, when in the  water. I make good time there, too.    Well, to go back to the Dutch captain. Two of the Swans he took alive to  Dutchland and everybody was greatly surprised. They said \"Ach!\" and  \"Himmel,\" and many other things which I do not remember. Since that  time they say the Black Swans have greatly diminished in numbers in  Australia. You will find us all over the world now, because we are so  ornamental; people like to have a few of us in their ponds and lakes.    They say that river in Australia which the captain explored was named  Swan river, and Australia took one of us for its armorial symbol. Well,  a Black Swan may look well on a shield, but no matter how hard you may  pull his tail-feathers, he'll never scream like the American Eagle.          THE BLACK SWAN.      Australia is the home of the Black Swan, and it is invested by an even  greater interest than attaches to the South American bird, which is  white. For many centuries it was considered to be an impossibility, but  by a singular stroke of fortune, says a celebrated naturalist, we are  able to name the precise day on which this unexpected discovery was  made. The Dutch navigator William de Vlaming, visiting the west coast of  Southland, sent two of his boats on the 6th of January, 1697, to explore  an estuary he had found. There their crews saw at first two and then  more Black Swans, of which they caught four, taking two of them alive to  Batavia; and Valentyn, who several years later recounted this voyage,  gives in his work a plate representing the ship, boats, and birds, at  the mouth of what is now known from this circumstance as the Swan River,  the most important stream of the thriving colony of West Australia,  which has adopted this Swan as its armorial symbol. Subsequent voyagers,  Cook and others, found that the range of the species extended over the  greater part of Australia, in many districts of which it was abundant.  It has since rapidly decreased in number there, and will most likely  soon cease to exist as a wild bird, but its singular and ornamental  appearance will probably preserve it as a modified captive in most  civilized countries, and it is said, perhaps even now there are more  Black Swans in a reclaimed condition in other lands than are at large  in their mother country.    The erect and graceful carriage of the Swan always excites the  admiration of the beholder, but the gentle bird has other qualities not  commonly known, one of which is great power of wing. The _Zoologist_  gives a curious incident relating to this subject. An American physician  writing to that journal, says that the first case of fracture with which  he had to deal was one of the forearm caused by the blows of a Swan's  wing. It was during the winter of 1870, at the Lake of Swans, in  Mississippi, that the patient was hunting at night, in a small boat and  by the light of torches. In the course of their maneuvers a flock of  Swans was suddenly encountered which took to flight without regard  to anything that might be in the way. As the man raised his arm  instinctively to ward off the swiftly rising birds, he was struck on his  forearm by the wing of one of the Swans in the act of getting under  motion, and as the action and labor of lifting itself were very great,  the arm was badly broken, both bones being fractured.    When left to itself the nest of the Swan is a large mass of aquatic  plants, often piled to the height of a couple of feet and about six feet  in diameter. In the midst of this is a hollow which contains the eggs,  generally from five to ten in number. They sit upon the eggs between  five and six weeks.    It is a curious coincidence that this biographical sketch should have  been written and a faithful portrait for the first time shown on the two  hundredth anniversary of the discovery of the Black Swan.     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  BLACK SWAN.                  Copyright by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1898, Chicago.]          LIFE IN THE NEST.

THE SNOWY PLOVER.      About one hundred species are comprised in the Plover family, which are  distributed throughout the world. Only eight species are found in North  America. Their habits in a general way resemble those of the true  Snipes, but their much shorter, stouter bills are not fitted for  probing, and they obtain their food from the surface of the ground.  Probably for this reason several species are so frequently found on the  uplands instead of wading about in shallow ponds or the margins of  streams. They frequent meadows and sandy tracts, where they run swiftly  along the ground in a peculiarly graceful manner. The Plovers are small  or medium-sized shore-birds. The Snowy Plover is found chiefly west of  the Rocky Mountains, and is a constant resident along the California  coast. It nests along the sandy beaches of the ocean. Mr. N. S. Goss  found it nesting on the salt plains along the Cimarron River in the  Indian Territory, the northern limits of which extend into southwestern  Kansas. The birds are described as being very much lighter in color than  those of California. Four eggs are usually laid, in ground color, pale  buff or clay color, with blackish-brown markings. Mr. Cory says the nest  is a mere depression in the sand. He says also that the Snowy Plover is  found in winter in many of the Gulf States, and is not uncommon in  Northwestern Florida.    When the female Snowy Plover is disturbed on the nest she will run over  the sand with outstretched wings and distressing gait, and endeavor to  lead the trespasser away from it. It sometimes utters a peculiar cry,  but is usually silent. The food of these birds consists of various  minute forms of life. They are similar in actions to the Semi-palmated  (see July BIRDS), and fully as silent. Indeed they are rarely heard to  utter a note except as the young are approached--when they are very  demonstrative--or when suddenly flushed, which, in the nesting season,  is a very rare thing, as they prefer to escape by running, dodging, and  squatting the moment they think they are out of danger, in hopes you  will pass without seeing them as the sandy lands they inhabit closely  resemble their plumage in color, and says Mr. Goss, you will certainly  do so should you look away or fail to go directly to the spot.    The first discovery of these interesting birds east of Great Salt Lake  was in June, 1886. A nest was found which contained three eggs, a full  set. It was a mere depression worked out in the sand to fit the body. It  was without lining, and had nothing near to shelter or hide it from  view.     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  SNOWY PLOVER.                  Copyright by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1898, Chicago.]          ONLY A BIRD.          Only a bird! and a vagrant boy        Fits a pebble with boyish skill      Into the folds of a supple sling.        \"Watch me hit him. I can, an' I will.\"      Whirr! and a silence chill and sad        Falls like a pall on the vibrant air,      From a birchen tree, whence a shower of song        Has fallen in ripples everywhere.        Only a bird! and the tiny throat        With quaver and trill and whistle of flute      Bruised and bleeding and silent lies        There at his feet. Its chords are mute.      And the boy with a loud and boisterous laugh,        Proud of his prowess and brutal skill,      Throws it aside with a careless toss.        \"Only a bird! it was made to kill.\"        Only a bird! yet far away        Little ones clamor and cry for food--      Clamor and cry, and the chill of night        Settles over the orphan brood.

Extending over the Great Plains from western and probably southern  Texas northward through Indian Territory to Kansas is said to be the  habitation of the Lesser Prairie Hen, though it is not fully known. It  inhabits the fertile prairies, seldom frequenting the timbered lands,  except during sleety storms, or when the ground is covered with snow.  Its flesh is dark and it is not very highly esteemed as a table bird.    The habits of these birds are similar to those of the Prairie Hen.  During the early breeding season they feed upon grasshoppers, crickets,  and other forms of insect life, but afterwards upon cultivated grains,  gleaned from the stubble in autumn and the corn fields in winter. They  are also fond of tender buds, berries, and fruits. When flushed, these  birds rise from the ground with a less whirring sound than the Ruffed  Grouse or Bob White, and their flight is not as swift, but more  protracted, and with less apparent effort, flapping and sailing along,  often to the distance of a mile or more. In the fall the birds come  together, and remain in flocks until the warmth of spring awakes the  passions of love; then, in the language of Col. Goss, as with a view to  fairness and the survival of the fittest, they select a smooth, open"]]]
