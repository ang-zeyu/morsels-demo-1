[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#5)"],[1,"quieted down; and the incident seemed at an end.    Instead, it had just begun.    For, within an hour, the Mistress--who, for days had been half-sick  with a cold--was stricken with a chill, and by night she was in the  first stages of pneumonia.    Then over The Place descended Gloom. A gloom Lad could not understand  until he went upstairs at dinner-time to escort the Mistress, as  usual, to the dining-room. But to his light scratch at her door there  was no reply. He scratched again and presently Master came out of the  room and ordered him down-stairs again.    Then from the Master's voice and look, Lad understood that something  was terribly amiss. Also, as she did not appear at dinner and as he  was for the first time in his life forbidden to go into her room, he  knew the Mistress was the victim of whatever mishap had befallen.    A strange man, with a black bag, came to the house early in the  evening; and he and the Master were closeted for an interminable time  in the Mistress' room. Lad had crept dejectedly upstairs behind them;  and sought to crowd into the room at their heels. The Master ordered  him back and shut the door in his face.    Lad lay down on the threshold, his nose to the crack at the bottom of  the door, and waited. He heard the murmur of speech.    Once he caught the Mistress' voice--changed and muffled and with a  puzzling new note in it--but undeniably the Mistress'. And his tail  thumped hopefully on the hall floor. But no one came to let him  in. And, after the mandate to keep out, he dared not scratch for  admittance.    The doctor almost stumbled across the couchant body of the dog as he  left the room with the Master. Being a dog-owner himself, the doctor  understood and his narrow escape from a fall over the living obstacle  did not irritate him. But it reminded him of something.    \"Those other dogs of yours outside there,\" he said to the Master, as  they went down the stairs, \"raised a fearful racket when my car came  down the drive, just now. Better send them all away somewhere till she  is better. The house must be kept perfectly quiet.\"    The Master looked back, up the stairway; at its top, pressed close  against the Mistress' door, crouched Lad. Something in the dog's  heartbroken attitude touched him.    \"I'll send them over to the boarding-kennels in the morning,\" he  answered. \"All except Lad. He and I are going to see this through,  together. He'll be quiet, if I tell him to.\"    All through the endless night, while the October wind howled and  yelled around the house, Lad lay outside the sick-room door, his nose  between his absurdly small white paws, his sorrowful eyes wide open,  his ears alert for the faintest sound from the room beyond.    Sometimes, when the wind screamed its loudest, Lad would lift his  head--his ruff a-bristle, his teeth glinting from under his upcurled  lip. And he would growl a throaty menace. It was as though he heard,  in the tempest's racket, the strife of evil gale-spirits to burst in  through the rattling windows and attack the stricken Mistress.  Perhaps--well, perhaps there are things visible and audible to  dogs; to which humans were deaf and blind. Or perhaps they are not.    Lad was there when day broke and when the Master, heavy-eyed from  sleeplessness, came out. He was there when the other dogs were herded  into the car and carried away to the boarding-kennels.    Lad was there when the car came back from the station, bringing to The  Place an angular, wooden-faced woman with yellow hair and a yellower  suitcase--a horrible woman who vaguely smelt of disinfectants and of  rigid Efficiency, and who presently approached the sick-room, clad and  capped in stiff white. Lad hated her.    He was there when the doctor came for his morning visit to the  invalid. And again he tried to edge his own way into the room, only to  be rebuffed once more.    \"This is the third time I've nearly broken my neck over that miserable  dog,\" chidingly announced the nurse, later in the day, as she came out  of the room and chanced to meet the Master on the landing. \"Do please  drive him away. _I've_ tried to do it, but he only snarls at me. And  in a dangerous case like this----\"    \"Leave him alone,\" briefly ordered the Master.    But when the nurse, sniffing, passed on, he called Lad over to  him. Reluctantly, the dog quitted the door and obeyed the summons.    \"Quiet!\" ordered the Master, speaking very slowly and distinctly. \"You  must keep quiet. _Quiet!_ Understand?\"    Lad understood. Lad always understood. He must not bark. He must move  silently. He must make no unnecessary sound. But, at least, the Master  had not forbidden him to snarl softly and loathingly at that  detestable white-clad woman every time she stepped over him.    So there was one grain of comfort.    Gently, the Master called him downstairs and across the living-room,  and put him out of the house. For, after all, a shaggy eighty-pound  dog is an inconvenience stretched across a sick-room doorsill.    Three minutes later, Lad had made his way through an open window into  the cellar and thence upstairs; and was stretched out, head between  paws, at the threshold of the Mistress' room.    On his thrice-a-day visits, the doctor was forced to step over him,  and was man enough to forbear to curse. Twenty times a day, the nurse  stumbled over his massive, inert body, and fumed in impotent rage. The  Master, too, came back and forth from the sick-room, with now and then  a kindly word for the suffering collie, and again and again put him  out of the house.    But always Lad managed, by hook or crook, to be back on guard within a  minute or two. And never once did the door of the Mistress' room open  that he did not make a strenuous attempt to enter.    Servants, nurse, doctor, and Master repeatedly forgot he was there,  and stubbed their toes across his body. Sometimes their feet drove  agonizingly into his tender flesh. But never a whimper or growl did  the pain wring from him. \"_Quiet!_\" had been the command, and he was  obeying.    And so it went on, through the awful days and the infinitely worse  nights. Except when he was ordered away by the Master, Lad would not  stir from his place at the door. And not even the Master's authority  could keep him away from it for five minutes a day.    The dog ate nothing, drank practically nothing, took no exercise;  moved not one inch, of his own will, from the doorway. In vain did the  glories of Autumn woods call to him. The rabbits would be thick, out  yonder in the forest, just now. So would the squirrels--against which  Lad had long since sworn a blood-feud (and one of which it had ever  been his futile life ambition to catch).    For him, these things no longer existed. Nothing existed; except his  mortal hatred of the unseen Something in that forbidden room--the  Something that was seeking to take the Mistress away with It. He  yearned unspeakably to be in that room to guard her from her nameless  Peril. And they would not let him in--these humans.    Wherefore he lay there, crushing his body close against the door  and--waiting.    And, inside the room, Death and the Napoleonic man with the black bag  fought their \"no-quarter\" duel for the life of the still, little white  figure in the great white bed.    One night, the doctor did not go home at all. Toward dawn the Master  lurched out of the room and sat down for a moment on the stairs, his  face in his hands. Then and then only, during all that time of  watching, did Lad leave the doorsill of his own accord.    Shaky with famine and weariness, he got to his feet, moaning softly,  and crept over to the Master; he lay down beside him, his huge head  athwart the man's knees; his muzzle reaching timidly toward the  tight-clenched hands.    Presently the Master went back into the sickroom. And Lad was left  alone in the darkness--to wonder and to listen and to wait. With a  tired sigh he returned to the door and once more took up his heartsick  vigil.    Then--on a golden morning, days later, the doctor came and went with  the look of a Conqueror. Even the wooden-faced nurse forgot to grunt  in disgust when she stumbled across the dog's body. She almost  smiled. And presently the Master came out through the doorway. He  stopped at sight of Lad, and turned back into the room. Lad could  hear him speak. And he heard a dear, _dear_ voice make answer; very  weakly, but no longer in that muffled and foreign tone which had so  frightened him. Then came a sentence the dog could understand.    \"Come in, old friend,\" said the Master, opening the door and standing  aside for Lad to enter.    At a bound, the collie was in the room. There lay the Mistress. She  was very thin, very white, very feeble. But she was there. The dread  Something had lost the battle.    Lad wanted to break forth into a peal of ecstatic barking that would  have deafened every one in the room. The Master read the wish and  interposed,    \"_Quiet!_\"    Lad heard. He controlled the yearning. But it cost him a world of  will-power to do it. As sedately as he could force himself to move, he  crossed to the bed.    The Mistress was smiling at him. One hand was stretched weakly forth  to stroke him. And she was saying almost in a whisper, \"Lad! Laddie!\"    That was all. But her hand was petting him in the dear way he loved so  well. And the Master was telling her all over again how the dog had  watched outside her door. Lad listened--not to the man's praise, but  to the woman's caressing whisper--and he quivered from head to  tail. He fought furiously with himself once again, to choke back the  rapturous barking that clamored for utterance. He knew this was no  time for noise. Even without the word of warning, he would have known  it. For the Mistress was whispering. Even the Master was speaking  scarce louder.    But one thing Lad realized: the black danger was past. The Mistress  was alive! And the whole house was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38827"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 1 (of 2) (#5)"],[1,"made fast was shown to great advantage--Osmanlis, Greeks, Persians,  Sabeans, Jews of great height and superb _physique_, known by  much-tasselled turbans, and a predominating Arab element.    We walked down the long, broad, covered bazar, with a broken water  channel in the middle, where there were crowds, solely of men, meat,  game, bread, fruit, grain, lentils, horse-shoes, pack saddles,  Manchester cottons, money-changers, silversmiths, and scribes, and  heard the roar of business, and the thin shouts of boys unaccustomed  to the sight of European women. The crowds pressed and followed,  picking at my clothes, and singing snatches of songs which were not  complimentary. It had not occurred to me that I was violating rigid  custom in appearing in a hat and gauze veil rather than in a _chadar_  and face cloth, but the mistake was made unpleasantly apparent. In  Moslem towns women go about in companies and never walk with men.    We visited an enclosed square, where there are barracks for _zaptiehs_  (gendarmes), the Kadi's court, and the prison, which consists of an  open grating like that of a menagerie, a covered space behind, and  dark cells or dens opening upon it, all better than the hovels of the  peasantry. There were a number of prisoners well clothed, and  apparently well fed, to whom we were an obvious diversion, but the  guards gesticulated, shouted, and brandished their side-arms, making  us at last understand that our presence in front of the grating was  forbidden. After seeing a large barrack yard, and walking, still  pursued by a crowd, round the forlorn outskirts of Aimarah, which  include a Sabean village, we visited the gold and silversmiths' shops  where the Sabeans were working at their craft, of which in this region  they have nearly a monopoly, not only settling temporarily in the  towns, but visiting the Arab encampments on the plains, where they are  always welcome as the makers and repairers of the ornaments with which  the women are loaded. These craftsmen and others of the race whom I  have seen differ greatly from the Arabs in appearance, being white  rather than brown, very white, _i.e._ very pale, with jet-black hair;  large, gentle, intelligent eyes; small, straight noses, and small,  well-formed mouths. The handsome faces of these \"Christians of St.  John\" are very pleasing in their expression, and there was a dainty  cleanliness about their persons and white clothing significant of  those frequent ablutions of both which are so remarkable a part of  their religion. The children at Aimarah, and generally in the riparian  villages, wear very handsome chased, convex silver links, each as  large as the top of a breakfast cup, to fasten their girdles.    The reedy marshes, the haunts of pelicans and pigs, are left behind at  Aimarah, and tamarisk scrub and liquorice appear on the banks. At  Kut-al-Aimarah, a small military post and an Arab town of sun-dried  bricks on the verge of a high bank above the Tigris, we landed again,  and ragamuffin boys pressed very much upon us, and ragamuffin  _zaptiehs_,[5] grotesquely dressed in clothes of different European  nationalities, pelted them with stones. To take up stones and throw  them at unwelcome visitors is a frequent way of getting rid of them in  the less civilised parts of the East.    A _zaptieh_ station, barracks, with a large and badly-kept parade  ground, a covered bazar well supplied, houses with blank walls, large  _cafes_ with broad matted benches, asafoetida, crowds of men of  superb _physique_, picturesque Arabs on high-bred horses, and a total  invisibility of women, were the salient features of Kut-al-Aimarah.  Big-masted, high-stemmed boats, the broad, turbid Tigris with a great  expanse of yellowish sand on its farther shore, reeds \"shaken with the  wind,\" and a windy sky, heavily overcast, made up the view from the  bank. There were seen for the first time by the new-comers the most  venerable boats in the world, for they were old even when Herodotus  mentions them--_kufas_ or _gophers_, very deep round baskets covered  with bitumen, with incurved tops, and worked by one man with a paddle.  These remarkable tubs are used for the conveyance of passengers,  goods, and even animals.      [Illustration: A GOPHER.]    Before leaving we visited the Arab Khan or Sheikh in his house. He  received us in an upper room of difficult access, carpeted with very  handsome rugs, and with a divan similarly covered, but the walls of  brown mud were not even plastered. His manner was dignified and  courteous, and his expression remarkably shrewd. A number of men  sitting on the floor represented by their haughty aspect and  magnificent _physique_ the royalty of the Ishmaelite descent from  Abraham. This Khan said that his tribe could put 3000 fighting men  into the field, but it was obvious that its independence is broken,  and that these tribal warriors are reckoned as Osmanli irregulars or  Bashi Bazouks. The Khan remarked that \"the English do not make good  friends, for,\" he added, \"they back out when difficulties arise.\"    On board the steamer the condition of the Arabs is much discussed,  and the old residents describe it as steadily growing worse under the  oppression and corruption of the Osmanli officials, who appear to be  doing their best to efface these fine riparian tribes by merciless  exactions coming upon the top of taxation so heavy as to render  agriculture unprofitable, the impositions actually driving thousands  of them to seek a living in the cities and to the Persian shores of  the Gulf, where they exchange a life of hereditary freedom for a  precarious and often scanty subsistence among unpropitious  surroundings. Still, the Arab of the desert is not conquered by the  Turks.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] According to the returns for 1889, the British tonnage entering  the Bushire roadstead was 111,745 out of 118,570 tons, and the imports  from British territory amounted to a value of L744,018 out of  L790,832. The exports from Bushire in the same year amounted to  L535,076, that of opium being largely on the increase. Among other  things exported are pistachio nuts, gum, almonds, madder, wool, and  cotton. Regarding gum, the wars in the Soudan have affected the supply  of it, and Persia is reaping the benefit, large quantities now being  collected from certain shrubs, especially from the wild almond, which  abounds at high altitudes. The drawback is that firewood and charcoal  are becoming consequently dearer and scarcer. The gum exported in 1889  was 7472 cwts., as against 14,918 in 1888, but the value was more than  the same.    The imports into Bushire, as comparing 1889 with 1888, have increased  by L244,186, and the exports by L147,862. The value of the export of  opium, chiefly to China, was L231,521, as against L148,523 in 1888.    [3] \"The Karun River,\" Hon. G. Curzon, M.P., _Proceedings of R.G.S._,  September 1890.

Layard describes the interior of the domed building as  consisting of two chambers, the outer one empty, and the inner one  containing the Prophet's tomb, built of bricks covered with white  stucco, and enclosed in a wooden case or ark, over which is thrown a  large blue cloth, fringed with yellow tassels, the name of the donor  being inscribed in Hebrew characters upon it.--Layard's _Early  Adventures_, vol. i. p. 214.

LETTER I (_Continued_)           BAGHDAD, _Jan. 5_.    The last day on the Tigris passed as pleasantly as its predecessors.  There was rain in the early morning, then frost which froze the rain  on deck, and at 7 A.M. the mercury in my cabin stood at 28 deg.    In the afternoon the country became more populous, that is, there were  _kraals_ of mat huts at frequent intervals, and groups of tents to  which an external wall of mats gave a certain aspect of permanence.  Increased cultivation accompanied the increased population. In some  places the ground was being scratched with a primitive plough of  unshod wood, or a branch of a tree slightly trimmed, leaving a scar  about two inches deep. These scars, which pass for furrows, are about  ten inches apart, and camel thorn, tamarisk, and other shrubs inimical  to crops stand between them. The seed is now being sown. After it  comes up it grows apace, and in spite of shallow scratches, camel  thorn, and tamarisk the tilth is so luxuriant that the husbandmen  actually turn cattle and sheep into it for two or three weeks, and  then leave it to throw up the ear! They say that there are from  eighteen to thirty-five stalks from each seed in consequence of this  process! The harvest is reaped in April, after which water covers the  land.    Another style of cultivation is adopted for land, of which we saw a  good deal, very low lying, and annually overflowed, usually  surrounding a nucleus of permanent marsh. This land, after the water  dries up, is destitute of vegetation, and presents a smooth, moist  surface full of cracks, which scales off later. No scratching is  needed for this soil. The seed is sown broadcast over it, and such of  it as is not devoured by birds falls into the cracks, and produces an  abundant crop. All this rich alluvial soil is stoneless, but is strewn  from Seleucia to Babylon with fragments of glass, bricks, and pottery.  Artificial mounds also abound, and remains of canals, all denoting  that these fertile plains in ancient days supported a large stationary  population. Of all that once was, this swirling river alone remains,  singing in every eddy and ripple--         \"For men may come and men may go,             But I go on for ever.\"    As we were writing in the evening we were nearly thrown off our chairs  by running aground with a thump, which injured one paddle wheel and  obliged us to lie up part "]]]
