I say excess, for to-day,  instructed by long experience, I have quite recovered from my former  fears; and, when I see a Scolia resting on a thistle-head, I do not  scruple to take her in my fingers, without any precaution whatever,  however large she may be and however menacing her aspect. My courage is  not all that it seems to be; I am quite ready to tell the Wasp-hunting  novice this. The Scoliae are notably peaceable. Their sting is an  implement of labour far more than a weapon of war; they use it to  paralyse the prey destined for their offspring; and only in the last  extremity do they employ it in self-defence. Moreover, the lack of  agility in their movements nearly always enables us to avoid their  sting; and, even if we be stung, the pain is almost insignificant.  This absence of any acute smarting as a result of the poison is almost  constant in the Hunting Wasps, whose weapon is a surgical lancet and  devised for the most delicate physiological operations.    Among the other Scoliae of my district I will mention the Two-banded  Scolia (S. bifasciata, VAN DER LIND), whom I see every year, in  September, working at the heaps of leaf-mould which are placed for  her benefit in a corner of my paddock; and the Interrupted Scolia (S.  interrupta, LATR.), the inhabitant of the sandy soil at the foot of the  neighbouring hills. Much smaller than the two preceding insects, but  also much commoner, a necessary condition of continuous observation,  they will provide me with the principal data for this study of the  Scoliae.    I open my old note book; and I see myself once more, on the 6th of  August, 1857, in the Bois des Issards, that famous copse near Avignon  which I have celebrated in my essay on the Bembex-wasps. (Cf. \"The  Hunting Wasps\": chapter 14.--Translator's Note.) Once again, my head  crammed with entomological projects, I am at the beginning of my  holidays which, for two months, will allow me to indulge in the insect's  company.    A fig for Mariotte's flask and Toricelli's tube! (Edme Mariotte  (1620-1684), a French chemist who discovered, independently of Robert  Boyle the Irishman (1627-1691), the law generally known as Boyle's law,  which states that the product of the volume and the temperature of a gas  is constant at constant temperature. His flask is an apparatus contrived  to illustrate atmospheric pressure and ensure a constant flow of  liquid.--Translator's Note.) (Evangelista Toricelli (1608-1647), a  disciple of Galileo and professor of philosophy and mathematics at  Florence. His \"tube\" is our mercury barometer. He was the first to  obtain a vacuum by means of mercury; and he also improved the microscope  and the telescope.--Translator's Note.) This is the thrice-blest period  when I cease to be a schoolmaster and become a schoolboy, the schoolboy  in love with animals. Like a madder-cutter off for his day's work, I  set out carrying over my shoulder a solid digging-implement, the local  luchet, and on my back my game-bag with boxes, bottles, trowel, glass  tubes, tweezers, lenses and other impedimenta. A large umbrella saves me  from sunstroke. It is the most scorching hour of the hottest day in the  year. Exhausted by the heat, the Cicadae are silent. The bronze-eyed  Gad-flies seek a refuge from the pitiless sun under the roof of my  silken shelter; other large Flies, the sobre-hued Pangoniae, dash  themselves recklessly against my face.    The spot at which I have installed myself is a sandy clearing which I  had recognized the year before as a site beloved of the Scoliae. Here  and there are scattered thickets of holm-oak, whose dense undergrowth  shelters a bed of dead leaves and a thin layer of mould. My memory has  served me well. Here, sure enough, as the heat grows a little less,  appear, coming I know not from whence, some Two-banded Scoliae. The  number increases; and it is not long before I see very nearly a dozen of  them about me, close enough for observation. By their smaller size and  more buoyant flight, they are easily known for males. Almost grazing  the ground, they fly softly, going to and fro, passing and repassing in  every direction. From time to time one of them alights on the ground,  feels the sand with his antennae and seems to be enquiring into what  is happening in the depths of the soil; then he resumes his flight,  alternately coming and going.    What are they waiting for? What are they seeking in these evolutions  of theirs, which are repeated a hundred times over? Food? No, for close  beside them stand several eryngo-stems, whose sturdy clusters are the  Wasps' usual resource at this season of parched vegetation; and not one  of them settles upon the flowers, not one of them seems to care about  their sugary exudations. Their attention is engrossed elsewhere. It  is the ground, it is the stretch of sand which they are so assiduously  exploring; what they are waiting for is the arrival of some female, who  bursting the cocoon, may appear from one moment to the next, issuing all  dusty from the ground. She will not be given time to brush herself or to  wash her eyes: three or four more of them will be there at once, eager  to dispute her possession. I am too familiar with the amorous contests  of the Hymenopteron clan to allow myself to be mistaken. It is the rule  for the males, who are the earlier of the two, to keep a close guard  around the natal spot and watch for the emergence of the females, whom  they pester with their pursuit the moment they reach the light of day.  This is the motive of the interminable ballet of my Scoliae. Let us have  patience: perhaps we shall witness the nuptials.    The hours go by; the Pangoniae and the Gad-flies desert my umbrella; the  Scoliae grow weary and gradually disappear. It is finished. I shall see  nothing more to-day. I repeat my laborious expedition to the Bois des  Issards over and over again; and each time I see the males as assiduous  as ever in skimming over the ground. My perseverance deserved to  succeed. It did, though the success was very incomplete. Let me describe  it, such as it was; the future will fill up the gaps.    A female issues from the soil before my eyes. She flies away, followed  by several males. With the luchet I dig at the point of emergence; and,  as the excavation progresses, I sift between my fingers the rubbish of  sand mixed with mould. In the sweat of my brow, as I may justly say, I  must have removed nearly a cubic yard of material, when at last I make  a find. This is a recently ruptured cocoon, to the side of which adheres  an empty skin, the last remnant of the game on which the larva fed that  wrought the said cocoon. Considering the good condition of its silken  fabric, this cocoon may have belonged to the Scolia who has just quitted  her underground dwelling before my eyes. As for the skin accompanying  it, this has been so much spoilt by the moisture of the soil and by the  grassy roots that I cannot determine its origin exactly. The cranium,  however, which is better-preserved, the mandibles and certain details of  the general configuration lead me to suspect the larva of a Lamellicorn.    It is getting late. This is enough for to-day. I am worn out, but amply  repaid for my exertions by a broken cocoon and the puzzling skin of a  wretched grub. Young people who make a hobby of natural history, would  you like to discover whether the sacred fire flows in your veins?  Imagine yourselves returning from such an expedition. You are carrying  on your shoulder the peasant's heavy spade; your loins are stiff with  the laborious digging which you have just finished in a crouching  position; the heat of an August afternoon has set your brain simmering;  your eyelids are tired by the itch of an inflammation resulting from the  overpowering light in which you have been working; you have a devouring  thirst; and before you lies the dusty prospect of the miles that  divide you from your well-earned rest. Yet something stings within  you; forgetful of your present woes you are absolutely glad of your  excursion. Why? Because you have in your possession a shred of rotten  skin. If this is so, my young friends, you may go ahead, for you will  do something, though I warn you that this does not mean, by a long way,  that you will get on in the world.    I examined this shred of skin with all the care that it deserved. My  first suspicions were confirmed: a Lamellicorn, a Scarabaeid in the  larval state, is the first food of the Wasp whose cocoon I have just  unearthed. But which of the Scarabaeidae? And does this cocoon, my  precious booty, really belong to the Scoliae? The problem is beginning  to take shape. To attempt its solution we must go back to the Bois des  Issards.    I did go back and so often that my patience ended by being exhausted  before the problem of the Scoliae had received a satisfactory solution.  The difficulties are great indeed, under the conditions. Where am I  to dig in the indefinite stretch of sandy soil to light upon a spot  frequented by the Scoliae? The luchet is driven into the ground at  random; and almost invariably I find none of what I am seeking. To be  sure, the males, flying level with the ground, give me a hint, at the  outset, with their certainty of instinct, as to the spots where the  females ought to be; but their hints are very vague, because they go so  far in every direction. If I wished to examine the soil which a single  male explores in his flight, with its constantly changing course, I  should have to turn over, to the depth of perhaps a yard, at least four  poles of earth. This is too much for my strength and the time at my  disposal. Then, as the season advances, the males disappear, whereupon I  am suddenly deprived of their hints. To know more or less where I should  thrust my luchet, I have only one resource left, which is to watch for  the females emerging from the ground or else "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34634"],[0,"A Narrative of the Death of Captain James Cook (#5)"],[1," coal trade, to one Mr. John Walker, now living in South  Whitby. In his employ, he afterwards became mate of a ship; in which  station having continued some time, he had the offer of being master,  which he refused, as it seems he had at that time turned his thoughts  towards the navy. Accordingly, at the breaking out of the war in 1755,  he entered on board the \"Eagle,\" of fifty-four guns, and in a short time  after, Sir Hugh Palliser was appointed to the command of that ship, a  circumstance that must not be passed unnoticed, as it proved the  foundation of the future fame and fortune of Captain Cook. His uncommon  merit did not long escape the observation of that discerning officer,  who promoted him to the quarter-deck, and ever after patronized him with  such zeal and attention, as must reflect the highest honour upon his  character. To Sir Hugh Palliser is the world indebted, for having first  noticed in an obscure situation, and afterwards brought forward in life,  the greatest nautical genius that ever any age or country has produced.  In the year 1758, we find him master of the \"Northumberland,\" then in  America, under the command of Lord Colville. It was there, he has been  heard to say, that during a hard winter he first read Euclid, and  applied himself to the study of astronomy and the mathematics, in which  he made no inconsiderable progress, assisted only by his own ingenuity  and industry. At the time he thus found means to cultivate and improve  his mind, and to supply the deficiency of an early education, he was  constantly engaged in the most busy and active scenes of the war in  America. At the siege of Quebec, Sir Hugh Palliser made him known to Sir  Charles Saunders, who committed to his charge the conducting of the  boats to the attack of Mount Morenci, and the embarkation that scaled  the heights of Abraham. He was also employed to examine the passage of  the river St. Laurence, and to lay buoys for the direction of the men of  war. In short, in whatever related to the reduction of that place in the  naval department, he had a principal share, and conducted himself so  well throughout the whole, as to recommend himself to the commander in  chief. At the conclusion of the war, Sir Hugh Palliser having the  command on the Newfoundland station, he appointed him to survey that  Island and the coast of Labradore, and gave him the \"Grenville\" brig for  that purpose. How well he performed that service, the charts he has  published afford sufficient testimony. In that employment he continued  till the year 1767, when the well known voyage to the South Sea, for  observing the transit of Venus, and making discoveries in that vast  ocean was planned. Lord Hawke, who then presided at the Admiralty, was  strongly solicited to give the command of that expedition to Mr.  Alexander Dalrymple; but through the interest of his friend Sir Hugh  Palliser, Captain Cook obtained the appointment, together with the rank  of lieutenant. It was stipulated, that on his return, he should, if he  chose it, again hold the place of surveyor of Newfoundland, and that his  family should be provided for, in case of an accident to himself.    He sailed from England in the \"Endeavour,\" in the year 1768, accompanied  by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and returned in 1771; after having  circumnavigated the globe, made several important discoveries in the  South Sea, and explored the islands of New Zealand, and great part of  the coast of New Holland. The skill and ability with which he conducted  that expedition, ranked his name high as a navigator, and could not fail  of recommending him to that great patron of naval merit, the Earl of  Sandwich, who then presided at the board of Admiralty. He was promoted  to the rank of master and commander, and a short time afterwards,  appointed to conduct another expedition to the Pacific Ocean, in search  of the supposed Southern continent, and added many valuable discoveries  to those he had before made in the South Sea. His own account of it is  before the public, and he is no less admired for the accuracy and  extensive knowledge which he has displayed in that work, than for his  skill and intrepidity in conducting the expedition. On his return, he  was promoted to the rank of post-captain, and appointed one of the  captains of Greenwich hospital. In that Retirement he did not continue  long: for an active life best suiting his disposition, he offered his  services to conduct a third expedition to the South Sea, which was then  in agitation, in order to explore a northern passage from Europe to  Asia: in this he unfortunately lost his life, but not till he had fully  accomplished the object of the voyage.    The character of Captain Cook will be best exemplified by the services  he has performed, which are universally known, and have ranked his name  above that of any navigator of ancient or of modern times. Nature had  endowed him with a mind vigorous and comprehensive, which in his riper  years he had cultivated with care and industry. His general knowledge  was extensive and various: in that of his own profession he was  unequalled. With a clear judgment, strong masculine sense, and the most  determined resolution; with a genius particularly turned for enterprize,  he pursued his object with unshaken perseverence:--vigilent and active  in an eminent degree:--cool and intrepid among dangers; patient and firm  under difficulties and distress; fertile in expedients; great and  original in all his designs; active and resolved in carrying them into  execution. These qualities rendered him the animating spirit of the  expedition: in every situation, he stood unrivalled and alone; on him  all eyes were turned; he was our leading-star, which at its setting,  left us involved in darkness and despair.    His constitution was strong, his mode of living temperate: why Captain  King should not suppose temperance as great a virtue in him as in any  other man, I am unable to guess. He had no repugnance to good living; he  always kept a good table, though he could bear the reverse without  murmuring. He was a modest man, and rather bashful; of an agreeable  lively conversation, sensible and intelligent. In his temper he was  somewhat hasty, but of a disposition the most friendly, benevolent, and  humane. His person was above six feet high, and though a good-looking  man, he was plain both in address and appearance. His head was small,  his hair, which was a dark brown, he wore tied behind. His face was full  of expression, his nose exceedingly well-shaped, his eyes, which were  small and of a brown cast, were quick and piercing; his eyebrows  prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of austerity.    He was beloved by his people, who looked up to him as to a father, and  obeyed his commands with alacrity. The confidence we placed in him was  unremitting; our admiration of his great talents unbounded; our esteem  for his good qualities affectionate and sincere.    In exploring unknown countries, the dangers he had to encounter were  various and uncommon. On such occasions, he always displayed great  presence of mind, and a steady perseverance in pursuit of his object.  The acquisition he has made to our knowledge of the globe is immense,  besides improving the art of navigation, and enriching the science of  natural philosophy.    He was remarkably distinguished for the activity of his mind: it was  that which enabled him to pay an unwearied attention to every object of  the service. The strict economy he observed in the expenditure of the  ship's stores, and the unremitting care he employed for the preservation  of the health of his people, were the causes that enabled him to  prosecute discoveries in remote parts of the globe, for such a length of  time as had been deemed impracticable by former navigators. The method  he discovered for preserving the health of seamen in long voyages, will  transmit his name to posterity as the friend and benefactor of mankind:  the success which attended it, afforded this truly great man more  satisfaction, than the distinguished fame that attended his discoveries.    England has been unanimous in her tribute of applause to his virtues,  and all Europe has borne testimony to his merit. There is hardly a  corner of the earth, however remote and savage, that will not long  remember his benevolence and humanity. The grateful Indian, in time to  come, pointing to the herds grazing his fertile plains, will relate to  his children how the first stock of them was introduced into the  country; and the name of Cook will be remembered among those benign  spirits, whom they worship as the source of every good, and the fountain  of every blessing.    It may not be amiss to observe, that the plate engraved by Sherwin,  after a painting by Dance, is a most excellent likeness of Captain Cook;  and more to be valued, as it is the only one I have seen that bears any  resemblance to him.          Observations Respecting the Introduction of the Venereal Disease Into  the Sandwich Islands      This publication affording a convenient opportunity, I embrace it, to  offer a few remarks upon a subject in some degree affecting the  reputation of the late voyages to the South Sea Islands. If we for a  moment suppose, that they have been the means of disseminating the  venereal disease among the inhabitants, the evil is of such a magnitude,  that we are induced to wish they had never been undertaken. For who  would not sooner remain ignorant of the interesting discoveries which  have been made, than bear the reflection of their having been attended  with such an irreparable injury to a happy and uncontaminated race of  people!    It is a point of dispute between Captain Wallis and Mons. Bougainville,  which of their ships it was, that introduced the disease to Otaheite.  And we find, that Captain Cook was apprehensive of his people having  left it at the Friendly Islands. "]]]
