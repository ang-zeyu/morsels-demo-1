But the reader must not be led to suppose that I acted \"Carabin\" or  \"Sangrado\" without any knowledge of my trade. From youth I have always  been a dabbler in medical and mystical study. Moreover, the practice of  physic is comparatively easy amongst dwellers in warm latitudes,  uncivilised peoples, where there is not that complication of maladies  which troubles more polished nations. And further, what simplifies  extremely the treatment of the sick in these parts is the undoubted  periodicity of disease, reducing almost all to one type-ague.[FN#20]  Many of the complaints of tropical climates, as medical men well know,  display palpably intermittent symptoms little known to colder  countries; and speaking from individual experience, I may safely assert  that in all cases of suffering, from a wound to ophthalmia, this  phenomenon has forced itself upon my notice. So much by way of excuse.  I therefore considered myself as well qualified for the work as if I  had taken out a buono per l'estero diploma at Padua, and not more  likely to do active harm than most of the regularly graduated young  surgeons who start to \"finish\" themselves upon the frame of the British  soldier.    After a month's hard work at Alexandria, I prepared to assume the  character of a wandering Darwaysh; after    [p.14]reforming my title from \"Mirza\"[FN#21] to \"Shaykh\"  Abdullah.[FN#22] A reverend man, whose name I do not care to quote,  some time ago initiated me into his order, the Kadiriyah, under the  high-sounding name of Bismillah-Shah:[FN#23] and, after a due period of  probation, he graciously elevated me to the proud position of a  Murshid,[FN#24] or Master in the mystic craft. I was therefore  sufficiently well acquainted with the tenets and practices of these  Oriental Freemasons. No character in the Moslem world is so proper for  disguise as that of the Darwaysh. It is assumed by all ranks, ages, and  creeds; by the nobleman who has been disgraced at court, and by the  peasant who is too idle to till the ground; by Dives, who is weary of  life, and by Lazarus, who begs his bread from door to door. Further,  the Darwaysh is allowed to ignore ceremony and politeness, as one who  ceases to appear upon the stage of life; he may pray or not, marry or  remain single as he pleases, be respectable in cloth of frieze as in  cloth of gold, and no one asks him-the chartered vagabond-    [p.15]Why he comes here? or Wherefore he goes there? He may wend his  way on foot alone, or ride his Arab mare followed by a dozen servants;  he is equally feared without weapons, as swaggering through the streets  armed to the teeth. The more haughty and offensive he is to the people,  the more they respect him; a decided advantage to the traveller of  choleric temperament. In the hour of imminent danger, he has only to  become a maniac, and he is safe; a madman in the East, like a notably  eccentric character in the West, is allowed to say or do whatever the  spirit directs. Add to this character a little knowledge of medicine, a  \"moderate skill in magic, and a reputation for caring for nothing but  study and books,\" together with capital sufficient to save you from the  chance of starving, and you appear in the East to peculiar advantage.  The only danger of the \"Mystic Path\"[FN#25] is, that the Darwaysh's  ragged coat not unfrequently covers the cut-throat, and, if seized in  the society of such a \"brother,\" you may reluctantly become his  companion, under the stick or on the stake. For be it known, Darwayshes  are of two orders, the Sharai, or those who conform to religion, and  the Bi-Sharai, or Luti, whose practices are hinted at by their own  tradition that \"he we daurna name\" once joined them for a week, but at  the end of that time left them in dismay, and returned to whence he  came.    [FN#1] \"Remembering . . . . reason,\" afterwards altered by the author  to \"much disliking, if fact must be told, my impolitic habit of telling  political truths, (in 1851 I had submitted to the Court of Directors  certain remarks upon the subject of Anglo-Indian misrule: I need hardly  say that the publication was refused with many threats), and not  unwilling to mortify my supporter (his colleague, Colonel W. Sykes),  refused his sanction, alleging as a no-reason,\" et seq.  [FN#2] The vagrant, the merchant, and the philosopher, amongst  Orientals, are frequently united in the same person.  [FN#3] In a communication made to the Royal Geographical Society, and  published in the 24th vol. of the Journal, I have given my reasons for  naturalising this word. It will be used in the following pages to  express a \"hill water-course, which rolls a torrent after rain, and is  either partially or wholly dry during the droughts.\" It is, in fact,  the Indian \"Nullah, or Nala.\"  [FN#4] \"In provinciis Arabum, ait Ibn Haukal, nullus dignoscitur  fluvius, aut mare quod navigia ferat.\" This truth has been disputed,  but now it is generally acknowledged.  [FN#5] A French traveller, the Viscount Escayrac de Lanture, was living  at Cairo as a native of the East, and preparing for a pilgrimage when I  was similarly engaged. Unfortunately he went to Damascus, where some  disturbance compelled him to resume his nationality. The only European  I have met with who visited Meccah without apostatising, is M.  Bertolucci, Swedish Consul at Cairo. This gentleman persuaded the  Badawin camel men who were accompanying him to Taif to introduce him in  disguise: he naïvely owns that his terror of discovery prevented his  making any observations. Dr. George A. Wallin, of Finland, performed  the Hajj in 1845; but his \"somewhat perilous position, and the filthy  company of Persians,\" were effectual obstacles to his taking notes.  [FN#6] No one felt the want of this \"silent friend,\" more than myself;  for though Eastern Arabia would not have been strange to me, the  Western regions were a terra incognita. Through Dr. Norton Shaw,  Secretary to the Royal Geographical Society, I addressed a paper full  of questions to Dr. Wallin, professor of Arabic at the University of  Helsingfors. But that adventurous traveller and industrious Orienta1ist  was then, as we afterwards heard with sorrow, no more; so the queries  remained unanswered. In these pages I have been careful to solve all  the little financial and domestic difficulties, so perplexing to the  \"freshman,\" whom circumstances compel to conceal his freshness from the  prying eyes of friends.  [FN#7] \"Then came Trafalgar: would that Nelson had known the meaning of  that name! it would have fixed a smile upon his dying lips!\" so says  the Rider through the Nubian Desert, giving us in a foot note the  curious information that \"Trafalgar\" is an Arabic word, which means the  \"Cape of Laurels.\" Trafalgar is nothing but a corruption of Tarf  al-Gharb-the side or skirt of the West; it being the most occidental  point then reached by Arab conquest.  [FN#8] In Arabic \"Ras al-Tin,\" the promontory upon which immortal  Pharos once stood. It is so called from the argile there found and  which supported an old pottery.  [FN#9] \"Praise be to Allah, Lord of the (three) worlds!\" a pious  ejaculation, which leaves the lips of the True Believer on all  occasions of concluding actions.  [FN#10] \"Bakhshish,\" says a modern writer, \"is a fee or present which  the Arabs (he here means the Egyptians, who got the word from the  Persians through the Turks,) claim on all occasions for services you  render them, as well as for services they have rendered you. A doctor  visits a patient gratis-the patient or his servant will ask for a  bakhshish (largesse); you employ, pay, clothe, and feed a child-the  father will demand his bakhshish; you may save the life of an Arab, at  the risk of your own, and he will certainly claim a bakhshish. This  bakhshish, in fact, is a sort of alms or tribute, which the poor Arab  believes himself entitled to claim from every respectable-looking  person.\"  [FN#11] Mafish, \"there is none,\" equivalent to, \"I have left my purse  at home.\" Nothing takes the Oriental mind so much as a retort  alliterative or jingling. An officer in the Bombay army (Colonel  Hamerton) once saved himself from assault and battery by informing a  furious band of natives, that under British rule \"harakat na hui,  barakat hui,\" \"blessing hath there been to you; bane there hath been  none.\"  [FN#12] In a coarser sense \"kayf\" is app1ied to all manner of  intoxication. Sonnini is not wrong when he says, \"the Arabs give the  name of Kayf to the voluptuous relaxation, the delicious stupor,  produced by the smoking of hemp.\"  [FN#13] Cleopatra's Needle is called by the native Ciceroni \"Masallat  Firaun,\" Pharaoh's packing needle. What Solomon, and the Jinnis and  Sikandar zu'l karnain (Alexander of Macedon), are to other Moslem  lands, such is Pharaoh to Egypt, the \"Caesar aut Diabolus\" of the Nile.  The ichneumon becomes \"Pharaoh's cat,\"-even the French were bitten and  named it, le rat de Pharaon; the prickly pear, \"Pharaoh's fig;\" the  guinea-worm, \"Pharaoh's worm;\" certain unapproachable sulphur springs,  \"Pharaoh's bath;\" a mausoleum at Petra, \"Pharaoh's palace;\" the mongrel  race now inhabiting the valley of the Nile is contemptuously named by  Turks and Arabs \"Jins Firaun,\" or \"Pharaoh's Breed;\" and a foul kind of  vulture (vultur percnopterus, ak baba of the Turks, and ukab of Sind),  \"Pharaoh's hen.\" This abhorrence of Pharaoh is, however, confined to  the vulgar and the religious. The philosophers and mystics of Al-Islam,  in their admiration of his impious daring, make him equal, and even  superior, to Moses. Sahil, a celebrated Sufi, declares that the secret  of the soul (i.e., its emanation) was first revealed when Pharaoh  declared himself a god. And Al-Ghazali sees in such temerity nothing  but the most noble aspiration to the divine, innate in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"ndants. They differ, however, in doctrine from the  Persians, believing in a transmigration of the soul, which, gradually  purified, is at last orbed into a perfect star. They are scrupulous of  caste, and will not allow a Jew or a Frank to touch a piece of their  furniture: yet they erect guest-houses for Infidels. In this they  resemble the Shiahs, who are far more particular about ceremonial purity  than the Sunnis. They use ablutions before each meal, and herein remind  us of the Hindus.  [FN#3] The communist principles of Mazdak the Persian (sixth century)  have given his nation a permanent bad fame in this particular among the  Arabs.  [FN#4] In Arabia the Sharif is the descendant of Hasan through his two  sons, Zaid and Hasan al-Musanna: the Sayyid is the descendant of Hosayn  through Zayn al-Abidin, the sole of twelve children who survived the  fatal field of Kerbela. The former devotes himself to government and  war; the latter, to learning and religion. In Persia and India, the  Sharif is the son of a Sayyid woman and a common Moslem. The Sayyid  Nejib al-Taraf (noble on one side) is the son of a Sayyid father and a  common Moslemah. The Sayyid Nejib al-Tarafayn (noble on both sides) is  one whose parents are both Sayyids.  [FN#5] Burckhardt alludes to this settlement when he says, In the  Eastern Desert, at three or four days journey from Medinah, lives a  whole Bedouin tribe, called Beni Aly, who are all of this Persian creed.  I travelled to Suwayrkiyah, and found it inhabited by Benu Hosayn. The  Benu Ali are Badawin settled at the Awali, near the Kuba Mosque: they  were originally slaves of the great house of Auf, and are still  heretical in their opinions.  [FN#6] Refusing, rejecting. Hence the origin of Rafizi,a rejector, a  heretic. Inna rafaznahum,verily we have rejected them, (Abu Bakr, Omar, and  Osman,) exclaim the Persians, glorying in the opprobrious epithet.  [FN#7] Sayyids in Al-Hijaz, as a general rule, do not denote their  descent by the green turband. In fact, most of them wear a red Kashmir  shawl round the head, when able to afford the luxury. The green turband  is an innovation in Al-Islam. In some countries it is confined to the  Sayyids; in others it is worn as a mark of distinction by pilgrims.  Khudabakhsh, the Indian, at Cairo generally dressed in a tender green  suit like a Mantis.  [FN#8] Plural of Suftaha half-caste Turk.  [FN#9] Plural of Zaydi. These are well-known schismatics of the Shiah  persuasion, who abound in Southern Arabia.  [FN#10] The Bayazi sect flourishes near Maskat, whose Imam or Prince,  it is said, belongs to the heretical persuasion. It rejects Osman, and  advocates the superiority of Omar over the other two Caliphs.  [FN#11] Sadat is the plural of Sayyid. This word in the Northern Hijaz  is applied indifferently to the posterity of Hasan and Hosayn.  [FN#12] The plural of Ahl, an inhabitant (of a particular place). The  reader will excuse my troubling him with these terms. As they are  almost all local in their application, and therefore are not explained  in such restricted sense by lexicographers, the specification may not  be useless to the Oriental student.  [FN#13] The Turkish yataghan. It is a long dagger, intended for thrusting  rather than cutting, and has a curve, which, methinks, has been wisely  copied by the Duke of Orleans, in the bayonet of the Chasseurs de  Vincennes.  [FN#14] See chapter xvii.  [FN#15] Omar Effendis brothers, grandsons of the principal Mufti of  Al-Madinah, were both shopkeepers, and were always exhorting him to do  some useful work, rather than muddle his brains and waste his time on  books.  [FN#16] See chapter xiv.  [FN#17] To a townsman, even during the dead season, the pay of a  gardener would be 2 piastres, a carpenter 8 piastres per diem, and a  common servant (a Bawwab or porter, for instance), 25 piastres per  mensem, or £3 per annum, besides board and dress. Considering the value  of money in the country, these are very high rates.  [FN#18] Who alone sell milk, curds, or butter. The reason of their  monopoly has been given in Chapter xiii.  [FN#19] History informs us that the sanctity of their birth-place has  not always preserved the people of Al-Madinah. But the memory of their  misfortunes is soon washed away by the overwhelming pride of the race.  [FN#20] The market is under the charge of an Arab Muhtasib or  Bazar-master, who again is subject to the Muhafiz or Pasha governing  the place. The following was the current price of provisions at  Al-Madinah early in August, 1853: during the Visitation season  everything is doubled:  1 lb. mutton, 2 piastres, (beef is half-price, but seldom eaten; there  is no buffalo meat, and only Badawin will touch the camel).  A fowl, 5 piastres.  Eggs, in summer 8, in winter 4, for the piastre.  1 lb. clarified butter, 4 piastres, (when cheap it falls to 2 1/2  Butter is made at home by those who eat it, and sometimes by the  Egyptians for sale).  1 lb. milk, 1 piastre.  1 lb. cheese, 2 piastres, (when cheap it is 1, when dear 3 piastres per  lb.)  A Wheaten loaf weighing 12 dirhams, 10 parahs. (There are loaves of 24  dirhams, costing 1/2 piastre.)  1 lb. dry biscuits, (imported), 3 piastres.  1 lb. of vegetables, 1/2 piastre.  1 Mudd dates, varies according to quality from 4 piastres to 100.  1 lb. grapes, 1 1/2} piastre.  A lime, 1 parah.  A pomegranate, from 20 parahs to 1 piastre.  A water-melon, from 3 to 6 piastres each.  1 lb. peaches, 2 piastres.  1 lb. coffee, 4 piastres, (the Yamani is the only kind drunk here).  1 lb. tea, 15 piastres, (black tea, imported from India).  1 lb. European loaf-sugar, 6 piastres, (white Egyptian, 5 piastres  brown Egyptian, 3 piastres; brown Indian, for cooking and conserves, 3  piastres).  1 lb. spermaceti candles, 7 piastres, (called wax, and imported from  Egypt).  1 lb. tallow candles, 3 piastres.  1 Ardeb wheat, 295 piastres.  1 Ardeb onions, 33 piastres, (when cheap 20, when dear 40).  1 Ardeb barley, 120 piastres, (minimum 90, maximum 180).  1 Ardeb rice, Indian, 302 piastres, (it varies from 260 to 350  piastres, according to quality).  Durrah or maize is generally given to animals, and is very cheap.  Barsim (clover, a bundle of) 3 Wakkiyahs, (36 Dirhams), costs 1 parah.  Adas or Lentil is the same price as rice.  1 lb. Latakia tobacco, 16 piastres.  1 lb. Syrian tobacco, 8 piastres.  1 lb. Tumbak (Persian), 6 piastres.  1 lb. olive oil, 6 piastres, (when cheap it is 4).  A skin of water, 1/2 piastre.  Bag of charcoal, containing 100 Wukkah, 10 piastres. The best kind is  made from an Acacia called Samur.  The Parah (Turkish), Faddah (Egyptian), or Diwani (Hijazi word), is the  40th part of a piastre, or nearly the quarter of a farthing. The  piastre is about 2 and two-fifths pence. Throughout Al-Hijaz there is  no want of small change, as in Egypt, where the deficiency calls for  the attention of the Government.  [FN#21] Physiologists have remarked that fat and greasy food,  containing a quantity of carbon, is peculiar to cold countries; whereas  the inhabitants of the tropics delight in fruits, vegetables, and  articles of diet which do not increase caloric. This must be taken cum  grano. In Italy, Spain, and Greece, the general use of olive oil  begins. In Africa and Asiaespecially in the hottest partsthe people  habitually eat enough clarified butter to satisfy an Esquimaux.  [FN#22] In Persia, you jocosely say to a man, when he is threatened  with a sudden inroad of guests, Go and swamp the rice with Raughan  (clarified butter).  [FN#23] Among the Indians, ghi, placed in pots carefully stopped up and  kept for years till a hard black mass only remains, is considered a  panacea for diseases and wounds.  [FN#24] Some of these slaves come from Abyssinia: the greater part are  driven from the Galla country, and exported at the harbours of the  Somali coast, Berberah, Tajurrah, and Zayla. As many as 2000 slaves  from the former place, and 4000 from the latter, are annually shipped  off to Mocha, Jeddah, Suez, and Maskat. It is strange that the Imam of  the latter place should voluntarily have made a treaty with us for the  suppression of this vile trade, and yet should allow so extensive an  importation to his dominions.  [FN#25] More will be said concerning the origin of this strange custom,  when speaking of Meccah and the Meccans.  [FN#26] The word Tarbush is a corruption from the Persian  Sarpush,head-covering, head-dress. The Anglo-Saxon further debases it to  Tarbush. The other name for the Tarbush, Fez, denotes the place where the  best were made. Some Egyptians distinguish between the two, calling the  large high crimson cap Fez, the small one Tarbush.  [FN#27] In India, as in Sind, a lady of fashion will sometimes be  occupied a quarter of an hour in persuading her bloomers to pass over the  region of the ankle.  [FN#28] In the plural called Jadail. It is a most becoming head-dress  when the hair is thick, and whenwhich I regret to say is rare in  Arabiathe twists are undone for ablution once a day.  [FN#29] Plural of Hurrah, the free, the noble.  [FN#30] See vol. i., p. 436, ante.  [FN#31] This appears to be, and to have been, a favourite weapon with  the Arabs. At the battle of Ohod, we read that the combatants amused  themselves with throwing stones. On our road to Meccah, the Badawi  attacked a party of city Arabs, and the fight was determined with these  harmless weapons. At Meccah, the men, as well as the boys, use them  with as much skill as the Somalis at Aden. As regards these feuds  between different quarters of the Arab towns, the reader will bear in  mind that such things can co-exist with considerable amount of  civilization. In my time, the different villages in the Sorrentine  plain were always at war. The Irish still fight in bodies at  Birkenhead. And in the days of our fathers, the gamins of London amused  themselves every Sunday by pitched"]]]
