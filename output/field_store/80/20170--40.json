The cross with the Saxon, for reasons hereafter to  be given, has not generally been so successful. With the Leicester and  Downs, the improvement, so far as form size, and a propensity to take on  fat are concerned, is manifest.      THE SPANISH MERINO.    [Illustration: A MERINO RAM.]    The Spanish sheep, in different countries, has, either directly or  indirectly, effected a complete revolution in the character of the  fleece. The race is unquestionably one of the most ancient extant. The  early writers on agriculture and the veterinary art describe various  breeds of sheep as existing in Spain, of different colors--black, red,  and tawny. The black sheep yielded a fine fleece, the finest of that  color which was then known; but the red fleece of Baetica--a considerable  part of the Spanish coast on the Mediterranean, comprising the modern  Spanish provinces of Gaen, Cordova, Seville, Andalusia, and Granada,  which was early colonized by the enterprising Greeks--was, according to  Pliny, of still superior quality, and \"had no fellow.\"    These sheep were probably imported from Italy, and of the Tarentine  breed, which had gradually spread from the coast of Syria, and of the  Black Sea, and had then reached the western extremity of Europe. Many of  them mingled with and improved the native breeds of Spain, while others  continued to exist as a distinct race, and, meeting with a climate and  an herbage suited to them, retained their original character and value,  and were the progenitors of the Merinos of the present day. Columella, a  colonist from Italy, and uncle of the writer of an excellent work on  agriculture, introduced more of the Tarentine sheep into Baetica, where  he resided in the reign of the Emperor Claudius, in the year 41, and  otherwise improved on the native breed; for, struck with the beauty of  some African rams which had been brought to Rome to be exhibited at the  public games, he purchased them, and conveyed them to his farm in Spain,  whence, probably, originated the better varieties of the long-woolled  breeds of that country.    Before his time, however, Spain possessed a valuable breed; since  Strabo, who flourished under Tiberius, speaking of the beautiful woollen  cloths that were worn by the Romans, says that the wool was brought from  Truditania, in Spain.    The limited region of Italy--overrun, as it repeatedly was, by hordes of  barbarians during and after the times of the latest emperors--soon lost  her pampered flocks; while the extended regions of Spain--intersected in  every direction by almost impassable mountains--could maintain their  more hardy race, in defiance of revolution or change.    To what extent the improvements which have been noticed were carried is  unknown; but as Spain was at that time highly civilized, and as  agriculture was the favorite pursuit of the greater part of the  colonists that spread over the vast territory, which then acknowledged  the Roman power, it is highly probable that Columella's experiments laid  the foundation for a general improvement in the Spanish sheep--an  improvement, moreover, which was not lost, nor even materially impaired,  during the darker ages that succeeded.    The Merino race possess inbred qualities to an extent surpassed by no  others. They have been improved in the general weight and evenness of  their fleece, as in the celebrated flock of Rambouillet; in the  uniformity and excessive fineness of the fibre, as in the Saxons; and in  their form and feeding qualities, in various countries; but there has  never yet been deterioration, either in quantity or quality of fleece or  carcass, wherever they have been transported, if supplied with suitable  food and attention. Most sheep annually shed their wool if unclipped;  while the Merino retains its fleece, sometimes for five years, when  allowed to remain unshorn.    Conclusive evidence is thus afforded of continued breeding among  themselves, by which the very constitution of the wool-producing organs  beneath the skin have become permanently established; and this property  is transmitted to a great extent, even among the crosses, thus marking  the Merino as an ancient and peculiar race.    The remains of the ancient varieties of color, also, as noticed by  Pliny, Solinus, and Columella, may still be discovered in the modern  Merino. The plain and indeed the only reason that can be assigned for  the union of black and gray faces with white bodies, in the same breed,  is the frequent intermixture of black and white sheep, until the white  prevails in the fleece, and the black is confined to the face and legs.  It is still apt to break out occasionally in the individual, unless it  is fixed and concentrated in the face and legs, by repeated crosses and  a careful selection; and, on the contrary, in the Merino South-Down the  black may be reduced by a few crosses to small spots about the legs,  while the Merino hue overspreads the countenance. This hue--variously  described as a velvet, a buff, a fawn, or a satin-colored countenance,  but in which a red tinge not infrequently predominates, still indicates  the original colors of the indigenous breeds of Spain; and the black  wool, for which Spain was formerly so much distinguished, is still  inclined to break out occasionally in the legs and ears of the Merino.  In some flocks half the ear is invariably brown, and a coarse black hair  is often discernible in the finest pile.    [Illustration: A SPANISH SHEEP DOG.]    The conquest, in the eighth century, by the Moors of those fine  provinces in the south of Spain, so far from checking, served rather to  encourage the production of fine wool. The conquerors were not only  enterprising, but highly skilled in the useful arts, and carried on  extensive manufactories of fine woollen goods, which they exported to  different countries. The luxury of the Moorish sovereigns has been the  theme of many writers; and in the thirteenth century, when the woollen  manufacture flourished in but few places, there were found in Seville no  less than sixteen thousand looms. A century later, Barcelona, Perpignan,  and Tortosa were celebrated for the fineness of their cloths, which  became staple articles of trade throughout the greater part of Europe,  as well as on the coast of Africa.    After the expulsion of the Moors, in the fifteenth century, by  Ferdinand and Isabella, the woollen manufacture languished, and was, in  a great degree, lost to Spain, owing to the rigorous banishment of  nearly one million industrious Moors, most of whom were weavers. As a  consequence, the sixteen thousand looms of Seville dwindled down to  sixty. The Spanish government perceived its fatal mistake too late, and  subsequent efforts to gain its lost vantage-ground in respect to this  manufacture proved fruitless. During all that time, however, the Spanish  sheep appear to have withstood the baneful influence of almost total  neglect; and although the Merino flocks and Merino wool have improved  under the more careful management of other countries, the world is  originally indebted to Spain for the most valuable material in the  manufacture of cloth.    The perpetuation of the Merino sheep in all its purity, amid the  convulsions which changed the entire political framework of Spain and  destroyed every other national improvement, strikingly illustrates the  primary determining power of blood or breeding, as well as the agency of  soil and climate--possibly too much underrated in modern times.    These Spanish sheep are divided into two classes: the _stationary_, or  those that remain during the whole of the year on a certain farm, or in  a certain district, there being a sufficient provision for them in  winter and in summer; and the _migratory_, or those which wander some  hundreds of miles twice in the year, in quest of pasturage. The  principal breed of stationary sheep consists of true Merinos; but the  breeds most sought for, and with which so many countries have been  enriched, are the Merinos of the migratory description, which pass the  summer in the mountains of the north, and the winter on the plains  toward the south of Spain.    The first impression made by the Merino sheep on one unacquainted with  its value would be unfavorable. The wool lying closer and thicker over  the body than in most other breeds, and being abundant in yolk--or a  peculiar secretion from the glands of the skin, which nourishes the wool  and causes it to mat closely together--is covered with a dirty crust,  often full of cracks. The legs are long, yet small in the bone; the  breast and the back are narrow, and the sides somewhat flat; the  fore-shoulders and bosoms are heavy, and too much of their weight is  carried on the coarser parts. The horns of the male are comparatively  large, curved, and with more or less of a spiral form; the head is  large, but the forehead rather low. A few of the females are horned;  but, generally speaking, they are without horns. Both male and female  have a peculiar coarse and unsightly growth of hair on the forehead and  cheeks, which the careful shepherd cuts away before the shearing-time;  the other part of the face has a pleasing and characteristic velvet  appearance. Under the throat there is a singular looseness of skin,  which gives them a remarkable appearance of throatiness, or hollowness  in the neck. The pile or hair, when pressed upon, is hard and  unyielding, owing to the thickness into which it grows on the pelf, and  the abundance of the yolk, retaining all the dirt and gravel which falls  upon it; but, upon examination, the fibre exceeds, in fineness and in  the number of serrations and curves, that which any other sheep in the  world produces."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39235"],[0,"A Manual of Toy Dogs: How to breed, rear, and feed them (#5)"],[1,"ch, and a piece of stale  sponge cake in the evening, is being reasonably fed, and should have a  healthy appetite. It is a mistake to feed only once a day, as such  treatment is only suitable for dogs so far in a state of nature that  they can gorge themselves to their fullest and sleep for hours  afterwards; and then take hard exercise.    It is quite a modern theory that the sins formerly laid to the charge of  meat are all unproven, but it is a perfectly just one. Not only do skin  complaints arise from malnutrition, or from improper feeding, or a too  large amount of starchy food, but a cure for them is frequently found in  changing the diet to one of raw or underdone _meat only_. This is modern  veterinary practice, as set forth by the cleverest man of the day--Mr.  Sewell--and others whose ability is unquestioned; in the olden times the  vet's invariable dictum, whether he understood the case or not--and  generally he was in dense ignorance as to whether mange, eczema, or  erythema was the trouble--was \"No meat!\" This idea, like others  primarily due to ignorance, dies hard, and these are still to be found  people who, ignoring the way a dog's teeth are formed, pronounce his  proper diet to be farinaceous, notwithstanding the fact that he was  created among the carnivora. Of course, we cannot keep a house pet,  altered by centuries of evolution, just as Nature kept him, on raw  flesh--for one thing, because he is not living the same sort of life;  but the conditions are not so different as to have turned a flesh-eating  animal into a graminivorous one.    I write, as I feel, strongly on this subject; for many a time have I  been vexed to see how obstinacy in compelling a dog to live on utterly  unnatural food, has made a miserable creature of one that would have  been happy, properly fed; and the same applies to many a litter of  puppies.    It has long been a common habit to feed puppies on sloppy, farinaceous  food, even up to the time when they are well on in getting their  permanent teeth; if this is a mistake with larger dogs, it is a grievous  folly with toys. People feed their pups four or five times a day on  watery bread and milk, Indian corn meal and oatmeal, and powdered  biscuit, all slopped with milk; they may even leave it about all day.  Some of the puppies, the greedy ones to wit, nearly burst themselves,  whereupon Nature rebels and relieves the pressure by means of diarrhoea;  others, dainty feeders, are sickened after one or two doses, and can  hardly be got to feed at all. They loathe their food, and getting them  on is a constant worry; presently they begin to be often sick (this is  the stomach's protest against being constantly distended with liquid  food) and if they have, as most puppies have, the ova of worms inside  them, these are immensely encouraged to develop, and lose no time in  doing so. A nice preparation for the critical period of teething!    If those who find toy puppies difficult to rear thus, would forsake  slops and feed them rationally, they would, I think, share the success  of a number of breeders, whose toys are noted for their health and  beauty, and whose methods I rely upon to back up my contention. Up to  the time the puppy can use its first teeth, give it nothing but milk,  pure, sweet, fresh, and _warm_ mixed with plasmon or any other good  dried milk powder; cold milk will give the baby colic. Teach it to lap  from a saucer of warm milk; either good cow's milk, if you can rely on  getting it free from boracic acid; pure cream and hot water to the  thickness of milk; goat's milk, best of all; or, in the last resource,  condensed milk, thinned with hot water.    The latter must be the kind which is not over-sweetened, and _not_ the  kind which has had the cream separated. Up to six weeks I find my  puppies do best on milk only; when their little teeth are through, and  their mother forsakes them, get them on to solids. A puppy loves to gnaw  a lump of stalish sponge cake, or suck a rusk; it comforts him to use  his sharp little needlepoints--feeds and amuses him at once. Let him  then have milk for breakfast and tea; an Osborne biscuit broken up, a  rusk of the kind known as \"tops and bottoms,\" just softened with a  little drop of milk, not made into a slop, or a bit of sponge cake, for  his dinner and supper. At four weeks he may have a little minced chicken  or boiled fish for dinner, or shredded boiled mutton; at two months he  may be fed like his elders, but with no big lumps of meat. All meat  given to puppies should be cut up finely, until they are six months old.  As to bones, a big bone is good for a puppy to suck and gnaw; but he  must not have any kind of bone which he can swallow in whole or part.  For grown-up toys any bones, but those of chicken, game, and fish, are a  permissible treat, one at a time, and that time at least a week from the  next or the last.          CHAPTER VI    EXHIBITING AND PREPARING FOR EXHIBITION.      Although the profits to be obtained from exhibiting are of a secondary  nature, and relative simply to the influence exercised on sales and the  way in which showing them brings dogs into public notice, it is well  worth the while of the dog owner who has a really good little toy to  exhibit it sometimes for the fun of the thing. At a show one can learn  more about breeds and points, and all the little details which interest  doggy folk, than is possible otherwise; compare notes with other owners,  and obtain many useful hints. I am sorry to say that we can also see a  good deal going on which would be well suppressed, and get glimpses of  the less attractive side of human nature which keen competition and  rivalry are apt to call forth, and which the socialistic mixture of all  classes composing \"the dog fancy\" encourages. \"Faking \"--dyeing pale tan  bright, pulling out coat, or tweaking white hairs, dusting disguising  powder into the stained jackets of white dogs, training ears to fall or  stand erect (temporarily) in the desired way, with other little  improvements, such as clipping the hair from the edges of Poms' ears and  from their paws and legs, are all practices nobody would own to, but  which nevertheless exist; while even perfectly honest owners are able to  bring their dogs to the front by legitimate methods which are unknown  to the novice, and which she can learn from the initiated. As to the  \"cruelty\" of showing, which Ouida so strongly deprecates, a word may be  said. It is certainly not kind to send a little petted toy, accustomed  to regular ways and the constant society of its owners to a show \"on its  own,\" unattended, and with no care but such as the show officials may  feel disposed to bestow upon it--often of a perfunctory character. On  the other hand, if its owner takes it to the show, establishes it in its  pen, visits it from time to time, feeds it, and takes it out of the show  at evening time to spend the night with her, as can always be arranged,  I fail to see the slightest cruelty in the matter--in fact, many dogs  enjoy being exhibited, and it is quite the exception to see a melancholy  face in the rows of pens devoted to the well-cared-for toy section.    The first thing to be thought of where exhibiting is contemplated is  getting the dog, or dogs, up to their very best form. A toy which is  properly looked after at home ought to be always, more or less, in show  condition, that is, as far as Nature's arrangements for the shedding of  coat, etc., permit; but a little extra care for a few weeks before a  show is desirable. Short-coated dogs, which, _par parenthese_, should  never be washed at all if it can be helped, must certainly not be washed  for at least a fortnight beforehand, but the least possible trace of  vaseline or cocoa-nut oil may be applied to their jackets and polished  off with a clean handkerchief; while brushing and hand-rubbing the right  way of the hair get up a beautiful gloss and sheen upon their coat, and  a little milk to drink daily helps this effect. Eyes should be washed,  and if noses are, as some, unfortunately, are too prone to be, dry, a  little vaseline well rubbed in with the finger twice a day will remedy  the defect.    Long-coated dogs, of course, need much more attention. They must have  extra combing and brushing, and, if dirty or flat in coat, but not  otherwise, should receive a tub about forty-eight hours before  appearing in the ring. For this, use _soft_, warm water, with, in the  case of Poms, whose jackets ought to stand out well, a teaspoonful of  powdered borax and a quarter of an ounce of dissolved gelatine to each  two quarts of water. The soap used should be carefully chosen, and of  the best--Vinolia or E. Cook & Son's Toilet Soap for choice; common  soaps are most unsuitable. Many people also use and much like this  firm's Improved Dog Soap. These stiff, stand-out coats are encouraged by  habitually brushing the wrong way of the hair, and this is advisable,  too, for the manes of Schipperkes. Flat-coated dogs, like Yorkshires and  toy spaniels, often spend their lives, the former especially, in the  intervals of shows, like summer fire-irons, \"in grease\"--that is, their  coats saturated with oil. To such an extent as this, the preparation may  be left to the professional exhibitor (with whom, it is as well to  remark, few inexperienced amateurs have much chance, as far as the  Yorkshire terrier is concerned); but a little cocoa-nut oil, with the  merest trace of cantharides, well rubbed into the roots of the hair for  some weeks beforehand, encourages the coat to look its best. Great care  is needful in washing white dogs, and only the best of soap should be  used; also soft water, with a little borax in it, and a squeeze of a  blue-bag in the rinsing-water, to prevent the hair from showing a yellow  tinge. Yorkshire terriers must not be rubbed up and about anyhow in  their bath; neither must Maltese nor toy spaniels; the hair so "]]]
