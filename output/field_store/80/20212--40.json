At last the chief counselor ended the auction by crying out:    \"Sold to Mary Ann Brodjinsky de la Porkus for three million, nine  hundred thousand, six hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixteen  cents!\" And the sour-looking old woman paid the money in cash and on  the spot, which proves this is a fairy story.    The king was so disturbed at the thought that he must marry this  hideous creature that he began to wail and weep; whereupon the woman  boxed his ears soundly. But the counselor reproved her for punishing  her future husband in public, saying:    \"You are not married yet. Wait until to-morrow, after the wedding  takes place. Then you can abuse him as much as you wish. But at  present we prefer to have people think this is a love match.\"    The poor king slept but little that night, so filled was he with  terror of his future wife. Nor could he get the idea out of his head  that he preferred to marry the armorer's daughter, who was about his  own age. He tossed and tumbled around upon his hard bed until the  moonlight came in at the window and lay like a great white sheet  upon the bare floor. Finally, in turning over for the hundredth  time, his hand struck against a secret spring in the headboard of  the big mahogany bedstead, and at once, with a sharp click, a panel  flew open.    The noise caused the king to look up, and, seeing the open panel, he  stood upon tiptoe, and, reaching within, drew out a folded paper. It  had several leaves fastened together like a book, and upon the first  page was written:      \"When the king is in trouble    This leaf he must double    And set it on fire    To obtain his desire.\"    This was not very good poetry, but when the king had spelled it out  in the moonlight he was filled with joy.    \"There's no doubt about my being in trouble,\" he exclaimed; \"so I'll  burn it at once, and see what happens.\"    He tore off the leaf and put the rest of the book in its secret  hiding place. Then, folding the paper double, he placed it on the  top of his stool, lighted a match and set fire to it.    It made a horrid smudge for so small a paper, and the king sat on  the edge of the bed and watched it eagerly.    When the smoke cleared away he was surprised to see, sitting upon  the stool, a round little man, who, with folded arms and crossed  legs, sat calmly facing the king and smoking a black briarwood pipe.    \"Well, here I am,\" said he.    \"So I see,\" replied the little king. \"But how did you get here?\"    \"Didn't you burn the paper?\" demanded the round man, by way of  answer.    \"Yes, I did,\" acknowledged the king.    \"Then you are in trouble, and I've come to help you out of it. I'm  the Slave of the Royal Bedstead.\"    \"Oh!\" said the king. \"I didn't know there was one.\"    \"Neither did your father, or he would not have been so foolish as to  sell everything he had for money. By the way, it's lucky for you he  did not sell this bedstead. Now, then, what do you want?\"    \"I'm not sure what I want,\" replied the king; \"but I know what I  don't want, and that is the old woman who is going to marry me.\"    \"That's easy enough,\" said the Slave of the Royal Bedstead. \"All you  need do is to return her the money she paid the chief counselor and  declare the match off. Don't be afraid. You are the king, and your  word is law.\"    \"To be sure,\" said the majesty. \"But I am in great need of money.  How am I going to live if the chief counselor returns to Mary Ann  Brodjinski her millions?\"    \"Phoo! that's easy enough,\" again answered the man, and, putting his  hand in his pocket, he drew out and tossed to the king an  old-fashioned leather purse. \"Keep that with you,\" said he, \"and you  will always be rich, for you can take out of the purse as many  twenty-five-cent silver pieces as you wish, one at a time. No matter  how often you take one out, another will instantly appear in its  place within the purse.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the king, gratefully. \"You have rendered me a rare  favor; for now I shall have money for all my needs and will not be  obliged to marry anyone. Thank you a thousand times!\"    \"Don't mention it,\" answered the other, puffing his pipe slowly and  watching the smoke curl into the moonlight. \"Such things are easy to  me. Is that all you want?\"    \"All I can think of just now,\" returned the king.    \"Then, please close that secret panel in the bedstead,\" said the  man; \"the other leaves of the book may be of use to you some time.\"    The boy stood upon the bed as before and, reaching up, closed the  opening so that no one else could discover it. Then he turned to  face his visitor, but the Slave of the Royal Bedstead had  disappeared.    \"I expected that,\" said his majesty; \"yet I am sorry he did not wait  to say good-by.\"    With a lightened heart and a sense of great relief the boy king  placed the leathern purse underneath his pillow, and climbing into  bed again slept soundly until morning.    When the sun rose his majesty rose also, refreshed and comforted,  and the first thing he did was to send for the chief counselor.    That mighty personage arrived looking glum and unhappy, but the boy  was too full of his own good fortune to notice it. Said he:    \"I have decided not to marry anyone, for I have just come into a  fortune of my own. Therefore I command you return to that old woman  the money she has paid you for the right to wear the coronet of the  queen of Quok. And make public declaration that the wedding will not  take place.\"    Hearing this the counselor began to tremble, for he saw the young  king had decided to reign in earnest; and he looked so guilty that  his majesty inquired:    \"Well! what is the matter now?\"    \"Sire,\" replied the wretch, in a shaking voice, \"I cannot return the  woman her money, for I have lost it!\"    \"Lost it!\" cried the king, in mingled astonishment and anger.    \"Even so, your majesty. On my way home from the auction last night I  stopped at the drug store to get some potash lozenges for my throat,  which was dry and hoarse with so much loud talking; and your majesty  will admit it was through my efforts the woman was induced to pay so  great a price. Well, going into the drug store I carelessly left the  package of money lying on the seat of my carriage, and when I came  out again it was gone. Nor was the thief anywhere to be seen.\"    \"Did you call the police?\" asked the king.    \"Yes, I called; but they were all on the next block, and although  they have promised to search for the robber I have little hope they  will ever find him.\"    The king sighed.    \"What shall we do now?\" he asked.    \"I fear you must marry Mary Ann Brodjinski,\" answered the chief  counselor; \"unless, indeed, you order the executioner to cut her  head off.\"    \"That would be wrong,\" declared the king. \"The woman must not be  harmed. And it is just that we return her money, for I will not  marry her under any circumstances.\"    \"Is that private fortune you mentioned large enough to repay her?\"  asked the counselor.    \"Why, yes,\" said the king, thoughtfully, \"but it will take some time  to do it, and that shall be your task. Call the woman here.\"    The counselor went in search of Mary Ann, who, when she heard she  was not to become a queen, but would receive her money back, flew  into a violent passion and boxed the chief counselor's ears so  viciously that they stung for nearly an hour. But she followed him  into the king's audience chamber, where she demanded her money in a  loud voice, claiming as well the interest due upon it over night.    \"The counselor has lost your money,\" said the boy king, \"but he  shall pay you every penny out of my own private purse. I fear,  however, you will be obliged to take it in small change.\"    \"That will not matter,\" she said, scowling upon the counselor as if  she longed to reach his ears again; \"I don't care how small the  change is so long as I get every penny that belongs to me, and the  interest. Where is it?\"    \"Here,\" answered the king, handing the counselor the leathern purse.  \"It is all in silver quarters, and they must be taken from the purse  one at a time; but there will be plenty to pay your demands, and to  spare.\"    So, there being no chairs, the counselor sat down upon the floor in  one corner and began counting out silver twenty-five-cent pieces  from the purse, one by one. And the old woman sat upon the floor  opposite him and took each piece of money from his hand.    It was a large sum: three million, nine hundred thousand, six  hundred and twenty-four dollars and sixteen cents. And it takes four  times as many twenty-five-cent pieces as it would dollars to make up  the amount.    The king left them sitting there and went to school, and often  thereafter he came to the counselor and interrupted him long enough  to get from the purse what money he needed to reign in a proper and  dignified manner. This somewhat delayed the counting, but as it was  a long job, anyway, that did not matter much.    The king grew to manhood and married the pretty daughter of the  armorer, and they now have two lovely children of their own. Once in  awhile they go into the big audience chamber of the palace and let  the little ones watch the aged, hoary-headed counselor count out  silver twenty-five-cent pieces to a withered old woman, who watched  his every movement to see that he does not cheat her.    It is a big sum, three million, nine hundred thousand, six hundred  and twenty-four dollars and sixteen cents in twenty-five-cent  pieces.    But this is how the counselor was punished for being so careless  with the woman's money. And this is how Mary Ann Brodjinski de la  Porkus was also punished for wishing to marry a ten-year-old king in  order that she might wear the coronet of the queen of Quok.

She had asked Nora to look after  Jane Gladys, and Nora promised she would."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#5)"],[1,"with sea flowers of exquisite  colorings. Although Trot did not know it, these flowers resembled  the rare orchids of earth in their fanciful shapes and marvelous  hues. The child did not examine them very closely, for across the  carpet of flowers loomed the magnificent and extensive palaces of  the mermaids.    These palaces were built of coral; white, pink and yellow being  used, and the colors arranged in graceful designs. The front of the  main palace, which now faced them, had circular ends connecting the  straight wall, not unlike the architecture we are all familiar with;  yet there seemed to be no windows to the building, although a series  of archways served as doors.    Arriving at one of the central archways, the band of sea maidens  separated. Princess Clia and Merla leading Trot and Cap'n Bill into  the palace, while the other mermaids swam swiftly away to their own  quarters.    \"Welcome!\" said Clia in her sweet voice. \"Here you are surrounded  only by friends and are in perfect safety. Please accept our  hospitality as freely as you desire, for we consider you honored  guests. I hope you will like our home,\" she added a little shyly.    \"We are sure to, dear Princess,\" Trot hastened to say.    Then Clia escorted them through the archway and into a lofty hall.  It was not a mere grotto, but had smoothly built walls of pink coral  inlaid with white. Trot at first thought there was no roof, for  looking upward she could see the water all above them. But the  princess, reading her thought, said with a smile, \"Yes, there is a  roof, or we would be unable to keep all the sea people out of our  palace. But the roof is made of glass to admit the light.\"    \"Glass!\" cried the astonished child. \"Then it must be an awful big  pane of glass.\"    \"It is,\" agreed Clia. \"Our roofs are considered quite wonderful, and  we owe them to the fairy powers of our queen. Of course, you  understand there is no natural way to make glass under water.\"    \"No indeed,\" said Cap'n Bill. And then he asked, \"Does your queen  live here?\"    \"Yes. She is waiting now, in her throne room, to welcome you. Shall  we go in?\"    \"I'd just as soon,\" replied Trot rather timidly, but she boldly  followed the princess, who glided through another arch into another  small room where several mermaids were reclining upon couches of  coral. They were beautifully dressed and wore many sparkling jewels.    \"Her Majesty is awaiting the strangers, Princess Clia,\" announced  one of these. \"You are asked to enter at once.\"    \"Come, then,\" said Clia, and once more taking Trot's hand, she led  the girl through still another arch, while Merla followed just  behind them, escorting Cap'n Bill. They now entered an apartment so  gorgeous that the child fairly gasped with astonishment. The queen's  throne room was indeed the grandest and most beautiful chamber in  all the ocean palaces. Its coral walls were thickly inlaid with  mother-of-pearl, exquisitely shaded and made into borders and floral  decorations. In the corners were cabinets, upon the shelves of which  many curious shells were arranged, all beautifully polished. The  floor glittered with gems arranged in patterns of flowers, like a  brilliant carpet.    Near the center of the room was a raised platform of mother-of-pearl  upon which stood a couch thickly studded with diamonds, rubies,  emeralds and pearls. Here reclined Queen Aquareine, a being so  lovely that Trot gazed upon her spellbound and Cap'n Bill took off  his sailor cap and held it in his hands.    All about the room were grouped other mother-of-pearl couches, not  raised like that of the queen, and upon each of these reclined a  pretty mermaid. They could not sit down as we do, Trot readily  understood, because of their tails; but they rested very gracefully  upon the couches with their trailing gauzy robes arranged in fleecy  folds.    When Clia and Merla escorted the strangers down the length of the  great room toward the royal throne, they met with pleasant looks and  smiles on every side, for the sea maidens were too polite to indulge  in curious stares. They paused just before the throne, and the queen  raised her head upon one elbow to observe them. \"Welcome, Mayre,\"  she said, \"and welcome, Cap'n Bill. I trust you are pleased with  your glimpse of the life beneath the surface of our sea.\"    \"I am,\" answered Trot, looking admiringly at the beautiful face of  the queen.    \"It's all mighty cur'ous an' strange-like,\" said the sailor slowly.  \"I'd no idee you mermaids were like this, at all!\"    \"Allow me to explain that it was to correct your wrong ideas about  us that led me to invite you to visit us,\" replied the Queen. \"We  usually pay little heed to the earth people, for we are content in  our own dominions; but, of course, we know all that goes on upon  your earth. So when Princess Clia chanced to overhear your absurd  statements concerning us, we were greatly amused and decided to let  you see with your own eyes just what we are like.\"    \"I'm glad you did,\" answered Cap'n Bill, dropping his eyes in some  confusion as he remembered his former description of the mermaids.    \"Now that you are here,\" continued the Queen in a cordial, friendly  tone, \"you may as well remain with us a few days and see the  wonderful sights of our ocean.\"    \"I'm much obliged to you, ma'am,\" said Trot, \"and I'd like to stay  ever so much, but mother worries jus' dreadfully if we don't get  home in time.\"    \"I'll arrange all that,\" said Aquareine with a smile.    \"How?\" asked the girl.    \"I will make your mother forget the passage of time so she will not  realize how long you are away. Then she cannot worry.\"    \"Can you do that?\" inquired Trot.    \"Very easily. I will send your mother into a deep sleep that will  last until you are ready to return home. Just at present she is  seated in her chair by the front window, engaged in knitting.\" The  queen paused to raise an arm and wave it slowly to and fro. Then she  added, \"Now your good mother is asleep, little Mayre, and instead of  worries I promise her pleasant dreams.\"    \"Won't someone rob the house while she's asleep?\" asked the child  anxiously.    \"No, dear. My charm will protect the house from any intrusion.\"    \"That's fine!\" exclaimed Trot in delight.    \"It's jes' won-erful!\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I wish I knew it was so.  Trot's mother has a awful sharp tongue when she's worried.\"    \"You may see for yourselves,\" declared the Queen, and waved her hand  again. At once they saw before them the room in the cottage, with  Mayre's mother asleep by the window. Her knitting was in her lap,  and the cat lay curled up beside her chair. It was all so natural  that Trot thought she could hear the clock over the fireplace tick.  After a moment the scene faded away, when the queen asked with  another smile, \"Are you satisfied?\"    \"Oh yes!\" cried Trot. \"But how could you do it?\"    \"It is a form of mirage,\" was the reply. \"We are able to bring any  earth scene before us whenever we wish. Sometimes these scenes are  reflected above the water so that mortals also observe them.\"    \"I've seen 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding. \"I've seen mirages, but I  never knowed what caused 'em afore now.\"    \"Whenever you see anything you do not understand and wish to ask  questions, I will be very glad to answer them,\" said the Queen.    \"One thing that bothers me,\" said Trot, \"is why we don't get wet,  being in the ocean with water all around us.\"    \"That is because no water really touches you,\" explained the Queen.  \"Your bodies have been made just like those of the mermaids in order  that you may fully enjoy your visit to us. One of our peculiar  qualities is that water is never permitted to quite touch our  bodies, or our gowns. Always there remains a very small space,  hardly a hair's breadth, between us and the water, which is the  reason we are always warm and dry.\"    \"I see,\" said Trot. \"That's why you don't get soggy or withered.\"    \"Exactly,\" laughed the Queen, and the other mermaids joined in her  merriment.    \"I s'pose that's how we can breathe without gills,\" remarked Cap'n  Bill thoughtfully.    \"Yes. The air space is constantly replenished from the water, which  contains air, and this enables us to breathe as freely as you do  upon the earth.\"    \"But we have fins,\" said Trot, looking at the fin that stood upright  on Cap'n Bill's back.    \"Yes. They allow us to guide ourselves as we swim, and so are very  useful,\" replied the Queen.    \"They make us more finished,\" said Cap'n Bill with a chuckle. Then,  suddenly becoming grave, he added, \"How about my rheumatics, ma'am?  Ain't I likely to get stiffened up with all this dampness?\"    \"No indeed,\" Aquareine answered. \"There is no such thing as  rheumatism in all our dominions. I promise no evil result shall  follow this visit to us, so please be as happy and contented as  possible.\"          CHAPTER 5    THE SEA-SERPENT      Just then Trot happened to look up at the glass roof and saw a  startling sight. A big head with a face surrounded by stubby gray  whiskers was poised just over them, and the head was connected with  a long, curved body that looked much like a sewer pipe.    \"Oh, there is King Anko,\" said the Queen, following the child's  gaze. \"Open a door and let him in, Clia, for I suppose our old  friend is anxious to see the earth people.\"    \"Won't he hurt us?\" asked the little girl with a shiver of fear.    \"Who, Anko? Oh no, my dear! We are very fond of the sea serpent, who  is king of this ocean, although he does not rule the mermaids. Old  Anko is a very agreeable fellow, as you will soon discover.\"    \"Can he talk?\" asked Trot.    \"Yes indeed.\"    \"And can we understand what he says?\"    \"Perfectly,\" replied the Queen. \"I have given you power, while you  remain here, to understand the language of every inhabitant of the  sea.\"    \"That's nice,\" said Trot gratefully.    The Princess Clia swam slowly to one of the walls of "]]]
