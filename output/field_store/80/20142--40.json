As showing what a good pony can do in the hands of a man who knows how  to make the most of him, Colonel Dodge states that he once tried to buy  an animal which pleased his eye, offering forty dollars for it;  whereupon the owner replied that the price was six hundred dollars.  Repeating the incident to someone who knew the pony, he was informed  that the owner had not been actuated by any boastful spirit; that he had  good reason for attaching a very high value to it. The man, it appeared,  had been employed to carry the mail bags between Chehuahua and El Paso,  nearly 300 miles apart, during a period of six months, when the roads  were closed for ordinary travel by marauding bands of Apache Indians on  the watch for white men.    He had to make the perilous journey once a week, and he performed it on  the pony, riding all night for three successive nights, and hiding by  day. The Indians, it may be added, are deterred by superstition from  risking death by night; hence an additional good reason for the express  rider's choice of time to travel. For six months the pony carried him  between ninety and a hundred miles on three consecutive nights in each  week; he went one week and returned the next in the same way. And  Colonel Dodge adds that this tax upon his powers \"had not diminished the  fire and flesh of that pony.\"    Writing of the breed in another work, _The Hunting Grounds of the Great  West_, Colonel Dodge observes that civilisation spoils this pony;  accustomed on the ranche and prairie to pick up his own living when  turned out after a long day's work in summer, and used to  semi-starvation in winter, when stabled, shod, and fed on corn, his  character undergoes a change. He either becomes morose, ill-tempered,  hard to manage and dangerous, or he degenerates into a fat, lazy,  short-winded cob, \"only fit for a baby or an octogenarian.\" The latter  change is the more usual. We can well understand that such would be the  result.    Colonel Dodge has no doubt but that the Indian pony is identical with  the Texan mustang or wild horse, concerning whose qualities we may take  the evidence of a contributor to the _Field_. \"C. E. H.\" writes, in an  article on \"A Texas Fair,\" published in 1891:--         \"The native stock for endurance and soundness of constitution       cannot be surpassed. We have owned many of these animals of       from fourteen to fifteen hands, and never had an unsound one       yet. They will carry one 70 miles a day without tiring; and we       sold a horse aged 8 years ten years ago, which was lately       disposed of for only L3 less than the sum we then received for       him.\"    The horses raised on the plains of Uruguay, on the River Plate, have  much in common with the mustang, but retain to a greater degree the  characteristics of their remote Spanish ancestry in the small lean head  and well-turned limbs. They are somewhat higher than the mustang,  varying between 14 and 15 hands, seldom exceeding the latter height; but  the natives attach no importance to hands and inches, it being an  acknowledged fact that the smallest horses are in many instances the  best. Accustomed to run at large until between four and five years old,  these horses are sound and hardy, capable of carrying fourteen or  fifteen stone all day without tiring and able to perform hard and  continuous work on little food.          ARMY HORSES OF THE FUTURE.      Let it not be supposed for a moment that in urging the merits of small  horses the writer seeks to asperse the value of heavy cavalry. Weight in  men and size in horses are indispensable for such work as our heavy  cavalry are called upon to perform; even the civilian mind can  appreciate the mysteries of tactics so far as to recognise that a charge  of heavy cavalry can effect infinitely greater results upon an enemy  than men mounted on ponies of fourteen hands or fourteen hands two  inches.    Authorities on military affairs seem agreed that the great improvements  made in small arms of precision since the Crimean War have done much to  impair the former value of heavy cavalry for direct attack; it needs no  trained intelligence to recognise that cavalry advancing in close rank  might well be shot down to a man in attempting to charge a foe, not  necessarily under cover, over a thousand yards of fairly open ground on  which such a manoeuvre is possible to cavalry. For artillery and  transport, however, we shall always need powerful horses, and the  draught power required is only to be obtained with height.    When it was made evident that very much larger numbers of mounted  infantry were required for the South African campaign than had been  anticipated, the remount agents were instructed to purchase cobs, and to  obtain these in quantity it was necessary to go to foreign countries,  the United States, Argentina, and Hungary, where they could be procured.  Had the demand been made for ponies, a very large proportion of our  Army's need could have been bought cheaply and quickly in this country.  For in the ponies of Exmoor, Wales, the New Forest and other districts,  we possess large numbers of animals whose small size bears no relation  to their weight carrying power, and whose mode of life is the best  possible preparation for \"roughing it\" in South Africa. Very different  is the case with the animals shipped from England.    For generations, now, horses for the saddle and lighter draught work  have been very largely bred less as necessaries than luxuries; the  conditions of their lives are artificial in a high degree, and the  constitution which could formerly withstand exposure, hard and  continuous work and scanty feed, has been softened by pampering. To take  such horses out of their stables where the temperature is regulated,  where they are warmly clothed and regularly fed, and despatch them to  endure the hardships of campaigning in countries where hay and oats are  unknown or unprocurable, and the forage obtainable is unsuited to  English chargers--in short, to most severely tax their powers under a  set of conditions entirely opposed to those to which they are  accustomed--is to invite heavy mortality.    The sacrifice of useful qualities to the \"god of inches\" is deplored  only in so far as it applies to horses for mounted infantry and light  cavalry. The utility of large and powerful horses is not, and never has  been, questioned. In point of fact it is their value for the work in  which they are employed that has done something to blind us to the very  real value--for special tasks--of ponies: and if the foregoing pages do  anything to prove that there is in modern warfare a place of the highest  importance which can only be filled by the small horse of 14.2 or  thereabouts, their object has been fulfilled.          BREEDING SMALL HORSES.      Assuming that the peculiar suitability of horses between 14 hands and 14  hands 3 inches for mounted infantry and light cavalry purposes is  acknowledged by the authorities, and that these forces will in future  form a larger proportion of our standing army, it behoves us to turn our  attention to the task of breeding. The high prices obtainable for  first-class polo ponies have given a stimulus to pony-breeding, and it  may be said the foundations of the industry have been laid. What the  present remount market is to the breeder of hunters, so may the market  for mounted infantry cobs be to the breeder of polo ponies; but with  this difference, that the latter, being handicapped by the height limit  of 14 hands 2 inches, and the exceedingly high standard of merit[3]  required by polo players, will have a larger proportion of \"misfits.\" To  compensate for the paucity of valuable prizes he may hope to draw in the  lottery of breeding, both stock and maintenance will be cheaper, if the  business be conducted on the lines which seem best calculated to result  in production of the horse desired.    [3] See _Ponies Past and Present_, by Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart. Vinton &  Co., Ltd.    What is required is an animal between 14.0 and 14.3 hands; it must be  stout and able to carry weight, capable of covering long distances at  fair speed, able to subsist on coarse or poor food for weeks together  without losing condition, strong of constitution to withstand the  exposure inevitable on a campaign, and the more tractable the better. To  get small horses endowed with these qualifications we must look to the  breeds which possess them in marked degree, to the ponies of the Welsh  Hills, Exmoor, the New Forest, the Fell districts, and West of Ireland.  In these we have ponies ranging in height from 12.2 to 13.3 or 14 hands;  they are compact, sturdy, and untiring; they can carry weights which are  out of all ratio to their size; they live on grass, and the open-air  life they lead, year in year out, has made them completely independent  of the luxurious \"coddling\" bestowed upon other horses.    These ponies lack only the size required in our mounted infantry horse,  and these essentials we can obtain from the sire we shall select.  Keeping ever in mind that an animal of the polo-pony stamp--a hunter in  miniature--is required, what sire is more likely to get the desired pony  than the Arab? We might use a small Thoroughbred with excellent results,  but having regard to the rarity with which we find good bone and sound  constitution in the Thoroughbred, and also having regard to the inherent  soundness and stoutness of the Eastern horse, we shall probably obtain  more satisfactory young stock from Forest and Moorland dams if we use  the Arab sire. Blood, it is truly urged, gives the superior speed and  courage required in the polo-pony, but let us not forget that Arabs were  the sires from which all our modern race-horses are descended. The best  horses on the Turf to-day may be traced to one of the three famous "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#5)"],[1,"im, and  that you will have no reason ere long to complain of his gaucheries.\"    \"And you really think, M. du Tillet, that he will be a useful  companion for my boys?\"    \"If you will pardon me for saying so, madam, I think that he will--at  any rate I am sure he can be trusted to teach them no wrong.\"    \"You are all against me,\" the marquise laughed. \"And you, Marie?\"    \"I did not think of him one way or the other,\" the girl said coldly.  \"He is very awkward; but as he is not to be my companion that does  not concern me. It is like one of papa's dogs, one more or less  makes no difference in the house so long as they do not tread upon  one's skirt.\"    \"That is the true spirit of the French nobility, Marie,\" her father  said sarcastically. \"Outside our own circle the whole human race is  nothing to us; they are animals who supply our wants, voila tour.  I tell you, my dear, that the time is coming when this will not  suffice.  The nation is stirring; that France which we have so long  ignored is lifting its head and muttering; the news from Paris is  more and more grave. The Assembly has assumed the supreme authority,  and the king is a puppet in its power. The air is dark as with a  thunder-cloud, and there may be such a storm sweep over France as  there has not been since the days of the Jacquerie.\"    \"But the people should be contented,\" M. du Tillet said; \"they have  had all the privileges they ever possessed given back to them.\"    \"Yes,\" the marquis assented, \"and there lies the danger. It is one  thing or the other. If as soon as the temper of the third estate  had been seen the king's guards had entered and cleared the place  and closed the door, as Cromwell did  when the parliament was  troublesome to him in England, that would have been one way. Paris  would have been troublesome, we might have had again the days of  the Fronde, but in the end the king's party would have won.    \"However, that was not the way tried. They began by concessions,  they go on with concessions, and each concession is made the ground  for more. It is like sliding down a hill; when you have once begun  you cannot stop yourself, and you go on until there is a crash;  then it may be you pick yourself up sorely wounded and bruised,  and begin to reclimb the hill slowly and painfully; it may be that  you are dashed to pieces. I am not a politician. I do not care much  for the life of Paris, and am well content to live quietly here on  our estates; but even I can see that a storm is gathering; and as  for my brother Auguste, he goes about shaking his head and wringing  his hands, his anticipations are of the darkest. What can one  expect when fellows like Voltaire and Rousseau were permitted by  their poisonous preaching to corrupt and inflame the imagination  of the people? Both those men's heads should have been cut off the  instant they began to write.    \"The scribblers are at the root of all the trouble with their  pestilent doctrines; but it is too late now, the mischief is done.  If we had a king strong and determined all might yet be well; but  Louis is weak in decision, he listens one moment to Mirabeau and the  next to the queen, who is more firm and courageous. And so things  drift on from bad to worse, and the Assembly, backed by the turbulent  scum of Paris, are masters of the situation.\"    For some time Harry lived a quiet life at the chateau. He found  his position a very pleasant one. The orders of the marquis that  he should be treated as one of the family were obeyed, and there  was no distinction made between himself and Ernest. In the morning  the two boys and himself worked with the abbe, a quiet and gentle  old man; in the afternoon they rode and fenced, under the instructions  of M. du Tillet or one or other of the gentlemen of the marquis  establishment; and on holidays shot or fished as they chose on  the preserves or streams of the estate. For an hour each morning  the two younger girls shared in their studies, learning Latin and  history with their brothers. Harry got on very well with Ernest,  but there was no real cordiality between them. The  hauteur and  insolence with which the young count treated his inferiors were a  constant source of exasperation to Harry.    \"He thinks himself a little god,\" he would often mutter to himself.  \"I would give a good deal to have him for three months at Westminster.  Wouldn't he get his conceit and nonsense knocked out of him!\"    At the same time he was always scrupulously polite and courteous to  his English companion--much too polite, indeed, to please Harry.  He had good qualities too: he was generous with his money, and  if during their rides a woman came up with a tale of distress he  was always ready to assist her. He was clever, and Harry, to his  surprise, found that his knowledge of Latin was far beyond his own,  and that Ernest could construct passages with the greatest ease  which altogether puzzled him. He was a splendid rider, and could  keep his seat with ease and grace on the most fiery animals in his  father's stables.    When they went out with their guns Harry felt his inferiority  keenly.  Not only was Ernest an excellent shot, but at the end of  a long day's sport he would come in apparently fresh and untired,  while Harry, although bodily far the most powerful, would be  completely done up; and at gymnastic exercises he could do with  ease feats which Harry could at first not even attempt. In this  respect, however, the English lad in three months' time was able  to rival him. His disgust at finding himself so easily beaten by a  French boy nerved him to the greatest exertions, and his muscles,  practised in all sorts of games, soon adapted themselves to the  new exercises.    Harry picked up French very rapidly. The absolute necessity there was  to express himself in that language caused him to make a progress  which surprised himself, and at the end of three months he was able  to converse with little difficulty, and having learned it entirely  by ear he spoke with a fair accent and pronunciation. M. du Tillet,  who was the principal instructor of the boys in their outdoor  exercises, took much pains to assist him in his French, and helped  him on in every way in his power.    In the evening there were dancing lessons, and although very far  from exhibiting the stately grace with which Ernest could perform  the minuet or other courtly dances  then in fashion, Harry came  in time to perform his part fairly. Two hours were spent in the  evening in the salon. This part of the day Harry at first found the  most tedious; but as soon as he began to speak fluently the marquis  addressed most of his conversation to him, asking him questions  about the life of English boys at school and about English manners  and customs, and Harry soon found himself chatting at his ease.    \"The distinction of classes is clearly very much less with you in  England than it is here,\" the marquis said one day when Harry had  been describing a great fight which had taken place between a party  of Westminster boys and those of the neighbourhood. \"It seems  extraordinary to me that sons of gentlemen should engage in a  personal fight with boys of the lowest class. Such a thing could  not happen here. If you were insulted by such a boy, what would  you do, Ernest?\"    \"I should run him through the body,\" Ernest said quietly.    \"Just so,\" his father replied, \"and I don't say you would be wrong  according to our notions; but I do not say that the English plan is  not the best. The English gentleman--for  Monsieur Sandwith says  that even among grown-up people the same habits prevail--does not  disdain to show the canaille that even with their own rough weapons  he is their superior, and he thus holds their respect. It is a  coarse way and altogether at variance with our notions, but there  is much to be said for it.\"    \"But it altogether does away with the reverence that the lower  class should feel for the upper,\" Ernest objected.    \"That is true, Ernest. So long as that feeling generally exists, so  long as there is, as it were, a wide chasm between the two classes,  as there has always existed in France, it would be unwise perhaps  for one of the upper to admit that in any respect there could be  any equality between them; but this is not so in England, where a  certain equality has always been allowed to exist. The Englishman  of all ranks has a certain feeling of self-respect and independence,  and the result is shown in the history of the wars which have been  fought between the two nations.    \"France in early days always relied upon her chivalry. The horde of  footmen she placed in the field counted for little. England, upon  the other hand, relied principally upon her archers and her pikemen,  and it must be admitted that they beat us handsomely. Then again in  the wars in Flanders, under the English general Marlborough their  infantry always proved themselves  superior to ours. It is galling  to admit it, but there is no blinking the facts of history. It seems  to me that the feeling of independence and self-respect which this  English system gives rise to, even among the lowest class, must  render them man for man better soldiers than those drawn from a  peasantry whose very lives are at the mercy of their lords.\"    \"I think, du Tillet,\" the marquis said later on on the same evening,  when the young people had retired, \"I have done very well in taking  my brother Auguste's advice as to having an English companion  for Ernest. If things were as they were under the Grand Monarque,  I do not say that it would have been wise to allow a young French  nobleman to get these English ideas into his head, but it is  different now.    \"We are on the eve of great changes. What will come of it no one  can say; but there will certainly be changes, and it is a good thing  that my children should get broader ideas than those in which we  were brought up. This lad is"]]]
