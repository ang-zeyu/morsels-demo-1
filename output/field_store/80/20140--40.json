Duellman (1958, 1960) regarded _S. leprus_ as having a gray venter.  Neill (1965) characterized his new subspecies on the basis of white  venter and spots on the dorsum. Some specimens from throughout the range  have only small round spots, instead of vermiculations (Fig. 6). The  gray ventral coloration is largely restricted to the population in Los  Tuxtlas, Veracruz, but only about 80 per cent of the specimens from the  Los Tuxtlas have gray venters, whereas specimens from Guatemala, Oaxaca,  Tabasco, and central Veracruz, Mexico, have white venters (rarely gray).  Since the specimens from British Honduras are not distinct from  specimens throughout most of the range, there is no reason to recognize  them as a subspecies.    _Etymology._--Greek, _lepra_, leprosy, in reference to the mottled color  pattern.    _Distribution._--Discontinuous; central Veracruz to British Honduras to  low elevations in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental, Los  Tuxtlas, Sierra Madre de Chiapas (Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Fig. 7)).    _Specimens examined._--(84).

Duellman (1958) placed  _rubrimaculatus_ apart from the other western species, because of its  relatively unexpanded digital tips and coloration. The digital tips are  like those in _leprus_, which _rubrimaculatus_ resembles. Except for the  reduction of the outer palmar tubercle, _rubrimaculatus_ could be a  member of the _leprus_ group.    _Syrrhophus rubrimaculatus_ is probably best treated as a Pacific  derivative of the _leprus_ group, even though the palmar tubercles do  not agree. The removal of _rubrimaculatus_ from the western complex  results in a more homogeneous remainder and does not greatly increase  the heterogeneity of the eastern complex.    _Etymology._--Latin, meaning spotted with red; in reference to the  colors in life.    _Distribution._--Low to moderate elevations on the Pacific versant of  southeastern Chiapas, Mexico (Fig. 7); probably extending into  adjacent Guatemala.    _Specimens examined._--(48) MEXICO, _Chiapas_: Escuintla, UMMZ 88283; 6  km.

So he wandered the streets of Barcelona and heard the tales of the  events that occurred when the \"Viceroy of the Isles\" was received there  by Isabella.    What days those had been! The march of Columbus through Spain to meet  Isabella at Sante Fe, was such as had a demigod appeared on earth.  Spain was thrilled. The world knew no night. The trumpets of heralds  rent the air, and men's hearts swelled high at the tales of the golden  empires that Colon had added to Aragon and Castile. Alas! they did not  know that there are riches which do not enrich, and that it is only the  gold that does good that ennobles.    As Columbus approached with his glittering cavaliers songs rent the air,  whose words have been interpreted--          \"Thy name, O Fernando!          Through all earth shall be sounded,        Columbus has triumphed,          His foes are confounded!\"    or          \"Thy name, Isabella,          Through all earth shall be sounded,        Columbus has triumphed,          His foes are confounded!\"    To Aragon and Castile Columbus had \"given a new world.\" Peals of golden  horns shook the delighted cities, where balconies overflowed with  flowers.    [Illustration: Barcelona.]    His reception at Barcelona by the King and Queen had been made  inconceivably splendid:                              \"That was a glorious day        That dawned on Barcelona. Banners filled        The thronging towers, the old bells rung, and blasts        Of lordly trumpets seemed to reach the sky        Cerulean. All Spain had gathered there,        And waited there his coming; Castilian knights,        Gay cavaliers, hidalgos young, and e'en the old        Puissant grandees of far Aragon,        With glittering mail and waving plumes and all        The peasant multitude with bannerets        And charms and flowers.                            \"Beneath pavilions        Of brocades of gold, the Court had met.        The dual crowns of Leon old and proud Castile        There waited him, the peasant mariner.                            \"The heralds waited        Near the open gates; the minstrels young and fair        Upon the tapestries and arrased walls,        And everywhere from all the happy provinces        The wandering troubadours.                            \"Afar was heard        A cry, a long acclaim. Afar was seen        A proud and stately steed with nodding plumes,        Bridled with gold, whose rider stately rode,        And still afar a long and sinuous train        Of silvery cavaliers. A shout arose,        And all the city, all the vales and hills,        With acclamations rung.                            \"He came, the Genoese,        With reverent look and calm and lofty mien,        And saw the wondering eyes and heard the cries,        And trumpet peals, as one who followed still        Some Guide unseen.                            \"Before his steed        Crowned Indians marched with lowly faces,        And wondered at the new world that they saw;        Gay parrots screamed from their gold-circled arms,        And from their crests swept airy plumes. The sun        Shone full in splendor on the scene, and here        The old and new world met!\"    The young Italian Chevalier, Pigafetta, Knight of Rhodes, visited the  scenes that his own countryman had made immortal by his voyage.    He thought of the plumed Indians and of the birds of splendid plumage  that Columbus had brought back.    He heard much of Magellan, the \"new Columbus.\" Why might he not go out  upon unknown seas with him and discover new races, and bring back with  him tropic spices, birds, and flowers?    He journeyed to Seville and there met Magellan. He entered into the  dreams of the new navigator. He asked Magellan to let him sail with him.    \"Why do you wish to enter upon such a hazardous undertaking?\"    \"I am desirous of seeing the wonderful things of the ocean!\"    Magellan saw it was so. The Spaniards might distrust him, the Portuguese  be jealous of him, but here was a man who would have no race  prejudices--a man after his own heart, whom he could trust.    \"You wish to see the wonders of the ocean world?\" he asked.    \"Yes, and I can write, and whatever I may do, and wherever I may go, I  will always be true to you--the heart of Pigafetta will always be loyal  to the Admiral!\"    \"My Italian Chevalier, you may embark with me to see the wonders of the  ocean world. You shall follow my lantern.\"    From that hour the young Italian lived in anticipation. What new lands  would he see, what palm islands, what gigantic men and strange birds,  and inhabitants of the sea?    The young Knight of Rhodes had spoken truly, whatever light might fail,  his heart would ever be true to the Admiral.    So the Knight embarked with the rude crew to follow, in the silences of  uncharted seas, the lantern of Magellan.    He composed on the voyage a narrative for Villiers de l'Isle Adams,  Grand Master of Rhodes. By this narrative we are still able to follow in  fancy the lantern of Magellan through the straits that now bear the name  of Magellan, to the newly discovered Pacific, and around the world.    His character was as spirited as Magellan's was noble.    We will sail with him in our voyage around the world, for _he_ went all  the way and bore the news of Magellan's triumphs to Seville again.           *       *       *       *       *    Beautiful Seville! We must glance at the city here. She was the pride of  Spain in those times when Spain dazzled the world. The Hispal of the  Phoenicians, the Hispales of the Roman conquest, and the Seville of the  Moors! Her glory had arisen in the twilight of history, and had grown  with the advancement of the race.    She was indeed beautiful at the time when Magellan was preparing for the  sea. The Moorish period had passed leaving her rich in arts and  treasures, and splendid architecture.    Situated on the banks of the Guadalquivir, circular in shape and  surrounded with more than a hundred Moorish towers, and about ten miles  in circumference, she rivaled the cities of Europe and of the Orient.    The great cathedral was being completed at that time, a mountain of art,  arising from its plain of marble. It was four hundred and thirty-one  feet long, and three hundred and fifteen feet wide, with solemn and  grand arches lighted by the finest windows in Spain, perhaps the most  enchanting lights through which the sun ever shone. The altars were  enriched by the wealth of discovery.    [Illustration: The Giralda.]    Over this mountain of gold, marbles, and gems gleamed the Giralda, or  weather vane, in the form of a statue, three hundred and fifty feet  high.    Seville at this time was a city of churches. To these, sailors resorted  while waiting for an expedition to complete its preparations for the  sea, for most of them were good Catholics, and such as hoped for God's  favor in the enterprise upon which they were about to enter.    Here, too, was the old Moorish palace, the Alcazar, with its delicate  lacework like the walls of the Alhambra, but richer in color. In this  palace was the Hall of the Ambassadors, one of the most enchanting  apartments ever created by the genius of man.    In the latter dream of Moorish fancy have passed aching hearts, as well  as those filled with wonder and delight. Here Pedro the Cruel received  one of the kings of Granada, and murdered him with his own hand, to rob  him of the jewels that adorned his person.    The tales of Pedro the Cruel haunted the city at this time.    We are told that this monarch used to go about the city in disguise.    One night he went out thus to serenade a beautiful lady. As he  approached the balcony with his guitar where the lady lived, he saw  another man there, who had come for the same purpose. The rival musician  filled him with rage, and the King rushed upon him and struck him down  and killed him.    He fled away. He reasoned that as he was in disguise no one could know  him.    There was an old woman who kept a bakery across the way from the house  where the noble lady lived. She was looking out of her window at the  time of the murder. She saw the act, and got a view of the terrible face  of the royal musician as he was fleeing away.    \"That was the King himself,\" said the old bake woman. \"By my soul, that  was the King!\"    The next day the news of the murder filled the city. The murdered man  was a person of rank and importance. The people were alarmed and  indignant.    \"Who did the deed?\" was a question that arose to every lip.    The King, cruel as he was, did not wish to be suspected of being a  street assassin. So he issued a proclamation in this form:    \"Unless the alcalde (judge) of Seville shall discover the murderer of  the gallant musician within three days, the alcalde shall lose his  head.\"    The city judge began to make great exertions to discover the murderer.    The old bake woman came to him and said:    \"I know who did the deed. But silence, silence! I saw it with my own  eyes, but we must be still. It was the King himself!\"    The alcalde dared not accuse the King, and yet he must save his own  head. What was he to do?    He made an image of the King. He then went to the palace.    \"O King! I have found the murderer. I have brought him here to receive  sentence.\"    The King was glad that a suspected person had been found, so that the  public thought might be directed to the suspect.    \"What shall be done with him?\" asked the alcalde.    \"What! He who would slay a musician about to serenade a noble lady?\"    \"Yes, your Majesty.\"    \"What shall be done with him? I condemn him to death. Bring him before  me.\"    The alcalde brought in the image of the King, and uncovered it.    The King beheld himself.    \"I will save _your_ head,\" said the King, and the alcalde went  thoughtfully away.          CHAPTER VI.    ENEMIES.--ESTEBAN GORMEZ.      No man living could better"]]]
