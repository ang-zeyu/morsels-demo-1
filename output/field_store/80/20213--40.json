At the same time his ears were saluted with a wild chattering in an  unknown tongue, and he found himself surrounded by a group of natives  of hideous appearance.  They were nearly naked, and bore spears and  heavy clubs as their only weapons.  Their hair was long, curly, and  thick as bushes, and through their noses and ears were stuck the teeth  of sharks and curious metal ornaments.    These creatures had stolen upon Rob so quietly that he had not heard a  sound, but now they jabbered loudly, as if much excited.    Finally one fat and somewhat aged native, who seemed to be a chief,  came close to Rob and said, in broken English:    \"How get here?\"    \"I flew,\" said the boy, with a grin.    The chief shook his head, saying:    \"No boat come.  How white man come?\"    \"Through the air,\" replied Rob, who was rather flattered at being  called a \"man.\"    The chief looked into the air with a puzzled expression and shook his  head again.    \"White man lie,\" he said calmly.    Then he held further conversation with his fellows, after which he  turned to Rob and announced:    \"Me see white man many times.  Come in big boats.  White man all bad.  Make kill with bang-sticks.  We kill white man with club.  Then we eat  white man.  Dead white man good.  Live white man bad!\"    This did not please Rob at all.  The idea of being eaten by savages had  never occurred to him as a sequel to his adventures.  So he said rather  anxiously to the chief.    \"Look here, old fellow; do you want to die?\"    \"Me no die.  You die,\" was the reply.    \"You'll die, too, if you eat me,\" said Rob.  \"I'm full of poison.\"    \"Poison?  Don't know poison,\" returned the chief, much perplexed to  understand him.    \"Well, poison will make you sick--awful sick.  Then you'll die.  I'm  full of it; eat it every day for breakfast.  It don't hurt white men,  you see, but it kills black men quicker than the bang-stick.\"    The chief listened to this statement carefully, but only understood it  in part.  After a moment's reflection he declared:    \"White man lie.  Lie all time.  Me eat plenty white man.  Never get  sick; never die.\"  Then he added, with renewed cheerfulness: \"Me eat  you, too!\"    Before Rob could think of a further protest, his captors caught up the  end of the rope and led him away through the forest.  He was tightly  bound, and one strand of rope ran across the machine on his wrist and  pressed it into his flesh until the pain was severe.  But he resolved  to be brave, whatever happened, so he stumbled along after the savages  without a word.    After a brief journey they came to a village, where Rob was thrust into  a brushwood hut and thrown upon the ground, still tightly bound.    \"We light fire,\" said the chief.  \"Then kill little white man.  Then  eat him.\"    With this comforting promise he went away and left Rob alone to think  the matter over.    \"This is tough,\" reflected the boy, with a groan.  \"I never expected to  feed cannibals.  Wish I was at home with mother and dad and the girls.  Wish I'd never seen the Demon of Electricity and his wonderful  inventions.  I was happy enough before I struck that awful Master Key.  And now I'll be eaten--with salt and pepper, probably.  Wonder if  there'll be any gravy.  Perhaps they'll boil me, with biscuits, as  mother does chickens.  Oh-h-h-h-h!  It's just awful!\"    In the midst of these depressing thoughts he became aware that  something was hurting his back.  After rolling over he found that he  had been lying upon a sharp stone that stuck out of the earth.  This  gave him an idea.  He rolled upon the stone again and began rubbing the  rope that bound him against the sharp edge.    Outside he could hear the crackling of fagots and the roar of a  newly-kindled fire, so he knew he had no time to spare.  He wriggled  and pushed his body right and left, right and left, sawing away at the  rope, until the strain and exertion started the perspiration from every  pore.    At length the rope parted, and hastily uncoiling it from his body Rob  stood up and rubbed his benumbed muscles and tried to regain his lost  breath.  He had not freed himself a moment too soon, he found, for  hearing a grunt of surprise behind him he turned around and saw a  native standing in the door of the hut.    Rob laughed, for he was not a bit afraid of the blacks now.  As the  native made a rush toward him the boy drew the electric tube from his  pocket, pointed it at the foe, and pressed the button.  The fellow sank  to the earth without even a groan, and lay still.    Then another black entered, followed by the fat chief.  When they saw  Rob at liberty, and their comrade lying apparently dead, the chief  cried out in surprise, using some expressive words in his own language.    \"If it's just the same to you, old chap,\" said Rob, coolly, \"I won't be  eaten to-day.  You can make a pie of that fellow on the ground.\"    \"No!  We eat you,\" cried the chief, angrily.  \"You cut rope, but no get  away; no boat!\"    \"I don't need a boat, thank you,\" said the boy; and then, as the other  native sprang forward, he pointed the tube and laid him out beside his  first victim.    At this act the chief stood an instant in amazed uncertainty.  Then he  turned and rushed from the hut.    Laughing with amusement at the waddling, fat figure, Rob followed the  chief and found himself standing almost in the center of the native  village.  A big fire was blazing merrily and the blacks were busy  making preparations for a grand feast.    Rob was quickly surrounded by a crowd of the villagers, who chattered  fiercely and made threatening motions in his direction; but as the  chief cried out to them a warning in the native tongue they kept a  respectful distance and contented themselves with brandishing their  spears and clubs.    \"If any of your fellows come nearer,\" Rob said to the fat chief, \"I'll  knock 'em over.\"    \"What you make do?\" asked the chief, nervously.    \"Watch sharp, and you'll see,\" answered Rob.  Then he made a mocking  bow to the circle and continued: \"I'm pleased to have met you fellows,  and proud to think you like me well enough to want to eat me; but I'm  in a bit of a hurry to-day, so I can't stop to be digested.\"  After  which, as the crowd broke into a hum of surprise, he added: \"Good-day,  black folks!\" and quickly turned the indicator of his traveling machine  to the word \"up.\"    Slowly he rose into the air, until his heels were just above the gaping  blacks; but there he stopped short.  With a thrill of fear he glanced  at the indicator.  It was pointed properly, and he knew at once that  something was wrong with the delicate mechanism that controlled it.  Probably the pressure of the rope across its face, when he was bound,  had put it out of order.  There he was, seven feet in the air, but  without the power to rise an inch farther.    This short flight, however, had greatly astonished the blacks, who,  seeing his body suspended in mid-air, immediately hailed him as a god,  and prostrated themselves upon the ground before him.    The fat chief had seen something of white men in his youth, and had  learned to mistrust them.  So, while he remained as prostrate as the  rest, he peeped at Rob with one of his little black eyes and saw that  the boy was ill at ease, and seemed both annoyed and frightened.    So he muttered some orders to the man next him, who wriggled along the  ground until he had reached a position behind Rob, when he rose and  pricked the suspended \"god\" with the point of his spear.    \"Ouch!\" yelled the boy; \"stop that!\"    He twisted his head around, and seeing the black again make a movement  with the spear, Rob turned his electric tube upon him and keeled him  over like a ten-pin.    The natives, who had looked up at his cry of pain, again prostrated  themselves, kicking their toes against the ground in a terrified tattoo  at this new evidence of the god's powers.    The situation was growing somewhat strained by this time, and Rob did  not know what the savages would decide to do next; so he thought it  best to move away from them, since he was unable to rise to a greater  height.  He turned the indicator towards the south, where a level space  appeared between the trees; but instead of taking that direction he  moved towards the northeast, a proof that his machine had now become  absolutely unreliable.  Moreover, he was slowly approaching the fire,  which, although it had ceased blazing, was a mass of glowing red embers.    In his excitement he turned the indicator this way and that, trying to  change the direction of his flight, but the only result of his endeavor  was to carry him directly over the fire, where he came to a full stop.    \"Murder!  Help!  Fire and blazes!\" he cried, as he felt the glow of the  coals beneath him.  \"I'll be roasted, after all!  Here; help, Fatty,  help!\"    The fat chief sprang to his feet and came to the rescue.  He reached  up, caught Rob by the heels, and pulled him down to the ground, away  from the fire.  But the next moment, as he clung to the boy's feet,  they both soared into the air again, and, although now far enough from  the fire to escape its heat, the savage, finding himself lifted from  the earth, uttered a scream of horror and let go of Rob, to fall head  over heels upon the ground.    The other blacks had by this time regained their feet, and now they  crowded around their chief and set him upright again.    Rob continued to float in the air, just above their heads, and now  abandoned all thoughts of escaping by means of his wrecked traveling  machine.  But he resolved to regain a foothold upon the earth and take  his chances of escape by running rather than flying.  So he turned the  indicator to the word \"down,\" and very slowly it obeyed, allowing him,  to his great relief, to sink gently to the ground.          6.  The Buccaneers      Once more the blacks formed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#5)"],[1,"within a fortnight felt his old joy return. Immediately his  thoughts grew fertile, he began to write again as he had not done since  he had quitted her in Rome. There was no question but that her presence  acted as a continual inspiration to his genius.    To this period of new happiness belonged the dramas of \"Agide,\"  \"Sofonisba,\" and \"Mirra.\" The plot of the latter came to him as he was  reading the speech of Mirra to her nurse in the \"Metamorphoses\" of Ovid,  and was written in the first heat of his emotion at the woman's words.  He was somewhat in doubt as to the success of a play written on such  a subject, but it was hailed as a triumph at its first presentation  some years later, and made a remarkable impression on Byron and on  Madame de Stael, and was considered by most critics as Ristori's finest  impersonation.    After two months the Countess had to return to Italy, and Alfieri's  gloom at the separation was further increased by the news of the death  of his friend Gandellini. He went to Siena, but found that city lonely  without his friend, and passed the winter in Pisa. He did a great amount  of reading, repolished his later dramas, and prepared new volumes of  them for the press. When winter ended he spent another two months of  summer with the Countess at Colmar, and then again they separated. This  time he resolved to work unremittingly, and did so until his health  failed and he had to rest. At about the same time the Countess decided  to leave Italy permanently, and at length Alfieri, towards the close of  1786, joined her and went with her to Paris. He writes in his memoirs  of this journey into France, \"This country which had always proved  extremely disagreeable to me, as much on account of my own character,  as the manners of the people, now appeared a perfect elysium.\" There  are many glimpses to be had of this new life in the French capital.  Montanari recounts how the Marquis Pindemonte, himself a dramatist,  used each evening to take an omelette souffle in the Countess's room,  while Alfieri sat in the chimney corner sipping his chocolate. Under  such peaceful auspices the poet spent many months in a critical  preparation of all his works for new publication.    In February, 1788, word reached the Countess that her husband had died  in Rome, and it would appear that she was soon afterwards married to  Alfieri, although in the will of the latter she is referred to as the  Countess of Albany and not as his wife. His memoirs do not once speak  of her as his wife, but from the date of her husband's death their life  together was uninterrupted. It is now generally assumed that they were  privately married about this time.    For three years the two lived quietly in Paris, spending their summers  and autumns at a new home Alfieri had acquired in Alsace. During these  years he printed two editions of his works, supervised their sales, and  wrote his remarkably entertaining memoirs, which were finished up to  May, 1790. The end of the three years found Paris on the brink of the  great Revolution.    Alfieri saw the black clouds gathering on the French horizon, but  stayed on in the desire to complete the printing of his works. He was  in turn amazed, alarmed, and disgusted at the succeeding events in  the establishment of a republic. The principles proclaimed by these  so-called destroyers of tyrants were not the principles of his own  freedom-loving heart, nor those of any of his heroic characters. He  writes, \"My heart was torn asunder on beholding the holy and sublime  cause of liberty betrayed by self-called philosophers,--so much did I  revolt at witnessing their ignorance, their folly, and their crimes;  at beholding the military power, and the insolence and licentiousness  of the civilians stupidly made the basis of what they termed political  liberty, that I henceforth desired nothing more ardently than to leave  a country which, like a lunatic hospital, contained only fools or  incurables.\"    Circumstances, however, conspired to keep them in Paris, the Countess  was dependent upon France for two-thirds of her income, Alfieri was  finishing the printing of his dramas. The hour came when Alfieri  determined that further delay would be more than foolhardy, and so, on  August 18, 1792, having obtained passports with great difficulty, he  drove with the Countess to the city barrier. A dramatic scene followed.  The National Guards found the passports correct, and would have let the  travelers pass, but at the same moment a crowd of drunken revelers broke  from a neighboring cabaret, and attracted by the well-laden carriage,  proceeded to stop its passage, while they debated whether they should  stone it or set it on fire. The Guards remonstrated, but the revelers  complained bitterly that people of wealth should leave the city. Alfieri  lost all prudence, and jumping from his carriage, seized the passports  from the man who held them and, as he himself tells the incident, \"Full  of disgust and rage, and not knowing at the moment, or in my passion  despising the immense peril that attended us, I thrice shook my passport  in my hand and shouted at the top of my voice, 'Look! Listen! Alfieri  is my name; Italian and not French; tall, lean, pale, red hair; I am  he; look at me; I have my passport, and I have had it legitimately from  those who could give it; we wish to pass, and by Heaven, we _will_  pass!'\"    The crowd was surprised, and before they had recovered Alfieri and the  Countess had driven past the barriers and were safely on their way. They  had left Paris none too soon. Two days later the same authorities that  had granted the passports confiscated the horses, furniture, and books  that Alfieri had left behind in Paris and declared both the Countess and  Alfieri refugee aristocrats. The fact that they were both foreigners  appeared to be of no importance. It was well that they had gone. The  Countess was too illustrious a personage to have escaped for long the  fury of the fast-gathering mob, and had she been lost Alfieri would  have shared her fate.    Florence thenceforth became the home of the Countess and of Alfieri.  He wrote desultorily, commenting upon what he had seen in France,  but for the most part devoted himself to a study of the classics. In  1795, when he was forty-six years of age, he started to learn Greek,  and was so fired with the desire that in a short time he had added an  intimate knowledge of Homer, AEschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides to that  he already had of the Latin authors. He was so much interested in the  \"Alcestis\" of Euripides that he wrote an original drama based on the  same theme. He was described at this time as of a tall and commanding  figure, with a face of intelligence, and the look of one born to  command, rather than obey. His forehead was broad and lofty; his red  hair fell in thick masses around it.    The restless youth had changed to a methodical, studious man, he  arranged his day by rule, and followed that rule exactly. Only one  event disturbed him, and that was the occupation of Florence by French  troops. He had distrusted the French while he lived among them, now when  they came to hold Florence in subjection his hatred of tyranny bade him  despise them. He refused to receive the call of the French general who,  having read his works, was anxious to meet him. On the correspondence  which passed between them in reference to this matter Alfieri wrote,  \"Dialogue between a lion in a cage, and his crocodile guardian.\"    When he had fled from France he had been compelled to leave some  of his printed works behind him, and he was now in fear lest their  appearance and eager appeal for liberty should seem to ally him with  the Revolutionary cause. Above all things he condemned the French  Revolution. To avoid this possibility he now advertised in the Italian  papers a disclaimer, warning the public against any edition of his  writings except such as he himself issued. With this formal announcement  he had to be content.    Alfieri had determined to write no more tragedies, and turned to  composition of comedies, of which he had six nearly completed when his  health failed. He rested for a time and then resumed his methodical life  of study and work. He was advised to give himself more recreation, but  was too obstinate to adopt any plan but his own. His health gave way  again, and neglecting the physician's advice, he tried to minister to  his own illness. Gradually he grew weaker, and on October 3, 1803, he  died. He was buried in the Florentine church of Santa Croce, and his  monument, carved by Canova, rises between the tombs of Michael Angelo  and Machiavelli. An inscription states by whom the memorial was erected.  \"Louisa, Princess of Stolbergh, Countess of Albany, to Vittorio Alfieri  of Asti, 1810.\" In 1824 she was buried in Santa Croce.    In his will Alfieri left everything to the Countess. Their love had  grown deeper with time. She wrote to a friend, \"You know, by experience,  what it is to lose a person with whom we have lived for twenty-six  years, who has never given us a moment of displeasure, whom we have  always adored, respected, and venerated.\" Each, tormented alone, had  found happiness finally in their united life.    What was Alfieri's part in the growth of that spirit which was preparing  to set Italy free? Why did Mazzini later point him out as one of the  great sources of inspiration for his \"Young Italy\"? We must remember  that literature and the drama are more closely related to Italian public  opinion than they are with us, that the appearance of a new book or play  is often a vital subject to a ministry. What the people read they felt,  and it was Alfieri who first showed them the immorality of national  servitude. One of his best critics has said that when Alfieri first  turned his glance toward the Italian stage, it presented anything but a  hopeful aspect. \"The degradation of a people"]]]
