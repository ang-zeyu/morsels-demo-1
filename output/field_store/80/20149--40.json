Perhaps we may better appreciate the meaning of these words by recalling  that, since the dawn of vertebrate life, sufficient of the earth's  surface has been worn away and washed into the sea to form, were the  strata piled directly one upon the other, fifteen or twenty miles of  rock. This, of course, is the sum total of sedimentary rocks, for such a  thickness as this is not to be found at any one locality; because,  during the various ups and downs that this world of ours has met with,  those portions that chanced to be out of water would receive no deposit  of mud or sand, and hence bear no corresponding stratum of rock. The  reader may think that there is a great deal of difference between  fifteen and twenty miles, but this liberal margin is due to the  difficulty of measuring the thickness of the rocks, and in Europe the  sum of the measurable strata is much greater than in North America.    The earliest traces of animal life are found deeper still, beneath  something like eighteen to twenty-five miles of rock, while below this  level are the strata in which dwelt the earliest living things,  organisms so small and simple that no trace of their existence has been  left, and we infer that they were there because any given group starts  in a modest way with small and simple individuals.    At the bottom, then, of twenty miles of rocks the seeker for the  progenitor of the great family of backboned animals finds the scant  remains of fish-like animals that the cautious naturalist, who is much  given to \"hedging,\" terms, not vertebrates, but prevertebrates or the  forerunners of backboned animals. The earliest of these consist of small  bony plates, and traces of a cartilaginous backbone from the Lower  Silurian of Colorado, believed to represent relatives of Chimaera and  species related to those better-known forms Holoptychius and Osteolepis,  which occur in higher strata. There are certainly indications of  vertebrate life, but the remains are so imperfect that little more can  be said regarding them, and this is also true of the small conical teeth  which occur in the Lower Silurian of St. Petersburg, and are thought to  be the teeth of some animal like the lamprey.    A little higher up in the rocks, though not in the scale of life, in the  Lower Old Red Sandstone of England, are found more numerous and better  preserved specimens of another little fish-like creature, rarely if ever  exceeding two inches in length, and also related (probably) to the  hag-fishes and lampreys that live to-day.    These early vertebrates are not only small, but they were cartilaginous,  so that it was essential for their preservation that they should be  buried in soft mud as soon as possible after death. Even if this took  place they were later on submitted to the pressure of some miles of  overlying rock until, in some cases, their remains have been pressed out  thinner than a sheet of paper, and so thoroughly incorporated into the  surrounding stone that it is no easy matter to trace their shadowy  outlines. With such drawbacks as these to contend with, it can scarcely  be wondered at that, while some naturalists believe these little  creatures to be related to the lamprey, others consider that they belong  to a perfectly distinct group of animals, and others still think it  possible that they may be the larval or early stages of larger and  better-developed forms.    Still higher up we come upon the abundant remains of numerous small  fish-like animals, more or less completely clad in bony armor,  indicating that they lived in troublous times when there was literally a  fight for existence and only such as were well armed or well protected  could hope to survive. A parallel case exists to-day in some of the  rivers of South America, where the little cat-fishes would possibly be  eaten out of existence but for the fact that they are covered--some of  them very completely--with plate-armor that enables them to defy their  enemies, or renders them such poor eating as not to be worth the taking.  The arrangement of the plates or scales in the living Loricaria is very  suggestive of the series of bony rings covering the body of the ancient  Cephalaspis, only the latter, so far as we know, had no side-fins; but  the creatures are in no wise related, and the similarity is in  appearance only.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Cephalaspis and Loricaria, an Ancient and a  Modern Armored Fish.]    Pterichthys, the wing fish, was another small, quaint, armor-clad  creature, whose fossilized remains were taken for those of a crab, and  once described as belonging to a beetle. Certainly the buckler of this  fish, which is the part most often preserved, with its jointed, bony  arms, looks to the untrained eye far more like some strange crustacean  than a fish, and even naturalists have pictured the animal as crawling  over the bare sands by means of those same arms. These fishes and their  allies were once the dominant type of life, and must have abounded in  favored localities, for in places are great deposits of their protective  shields jumbled together in a confused mass, and, save that they have  hardened into stone, lying just as they were washed up on the ancient  beach ages ago. How abundant they were may be gathered from the fact  that it is believed their bodies helped consolidate portions of the  strata of the English Old Red Sandstone. Says Mr. Hutchinson, speaking  of the Caithness Flagstones, \"They owe their peculiar tenacity and  durability to the dead fishes that rotted in their midst while yet they  were only soft mud. For just as a plaster cast boiled in oil becomes  thereby denser and more durable, so the oily and other matter coming  from decomposing fish operated on the surrounding sand or mud so as to  make it more compact.\"    It may not be easy to explain how it came to pass that fishes dwelling  in salt water, as these undoubtedly did, were thus deposited in great  numbers, but we may now and then see how deposits of fresh-water fishes  may have been formed. When rivers flowing through a stretch of level  country are swollen during the spring floods, they overflow their banks,  often carrying along large numbers of fishes. As the water subsides  these may be caught in shallow pools that soon dry up, leaving the  fishes to perish, and every year the Illinois game association rescues  from the \"back waters\" quantities of bass that would otherwise be lost.  Mr. F. S. Webster has recorded an instance that came under his  observation in Texas, where thousands of gar pikes, trapped in a lake  formed by an overflow of the Rio Grande, had been, by the drying up of  this lake, penned into a pool about seventy-five feet long by  twenty-five feet wide. The fish were literally packed together like  sardines, layer upon layer, and a shot fired into the pool would set the  entire mass in motion, the larger gars as they dashed about casting the  smaller fry into the air, a score at a time. Mr. Webster estimates that  there must have been not less than 700 or 800 fish in the pool, from a  foot and a half up to seven feet in length, every one of which perished  a little later. In addition to the fish in the pond, hundreds of those  that had died previously lay about in every direction, and one can  readily imagine what a fish-bed this would have made had the occurrence  taken place in the past.    From the better-preserved specimens that do now and then turn up, we are  able to obtain a very exact idea of the construction of the bony cuirass  by which Pterichthys and its American cousin were protected, and to make  a pretty accurate reconstruction of the entire animal. These primitive  fishes had mouths, for eating is a necessity; but these mouths were not  associated with true jaws, for the two do not, as might be supposed,  necessarily go together. Neither did these animals possess hard  backbones, and, while Pterichthys and its relatives had arms or fins,  the hard parts of these were not on the inside but on the outside, so  that the limb was more like the leg of a crab than the fin of a fish;  and this is among the reasons why some naturalists have been led to  conclude that vertebrates may have developed from crustaceans.  Pteraspis, another of these little armored prevertebrates, had a less  complicated covering, and looked very much like a small fish with its  fore parts caught in an elongate clam-shell.    The fishes that we have so far been considering--orphans of the past  they might be termed, as they have no living relatives--were little  fellows; but their immediate successors, preserved in the Devonian  strata, particularly of North America, were the giants of those days,  termed, from their size and presumably fierce appearance, Titantichthys  and Dinichthys, and are related to a fish, _Ceratodus_, still living in  Australia.    We know practically nothing of the external appearance of these fishes,  great and fierce though they may have been, with powerful jaws and  armored heads, for they had no bony skeleton--as if they devoted their  energies to preying upon their neighbors rather than to internal  improvements. They attained a length of ten to eighteen feet, with a  gape, in the large species called Titanichthys, of four feet, and such a  fish might well be capable of devouring anything known to have lived at  that early date.    Succeeding these, in Carboniferous times, came a host of shark-like  creatures known mainly from their teeth and spines, for their skeletons  were of cartilage, and belonging to types that have mostly perished,  giving place to others better adapted to the changed conditions"]]]
