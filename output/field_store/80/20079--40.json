It remains, in the last place, that I should give some account of  myself; of the criticisms that I, who am not an artist, have ventured to  pass upon each painter: and, indeed, if the professors of the art had as  much leisure and experience in writing as they have ability, every  author might resign to them the field. The propriety of technical terms,  the abilities of artists, and the selection of specimens of art, are  usually better understood, even by an indifferent artist, than by the  learned connoisseur: but since those occupied in painting have not  sufficient leisure to write, others, assisted by them, may be permitted  to undertake the office.[18]    By the mutual assistance which the painter has afforded to the man of  letters, and the man of letters to the artist, the history of painting  has been greatly advanced. The merits of the best painters are already  so ably discussed that a modern historian can treat the subject  advantageously. The criticisms I most regard are those that come  directly from professors of the art. We meet with few from the pen of  Raphael, of Titian, of Poussin, and of other great masters; such as  exist, however, I regard as most precious, and deserving the most  careful preservation; for, in general, those who can best perform can  likewise judge the best. Vasari, Lomazzo, Passeri, Ridolfi, Boschini,  Zanotti, and Crespi, require, perhaps, to be narrowly watched in some  passages where they allowed themselves to be surprised by a spirit of  party: but, on the whole, they have an undoubted right to dictate to us,  because they were themselves painters. Bellori, Baldinucci, Count  Malvasia, Count Tassi, and similar writers, hold an inferior rank; but  are not wholly destitute of authority: for though mere _dilettanti_,  they have collected both the opinions of professors and of the public.  This will at present suffice, with regard to the historians of the art:  we shall notice each of them particularly under the school which he has  described.    In pronouncing a criticism upon each artist I have adopted the plan of  Baillet, the author of a voluminous history of works on taste, where he  does not so frequently give his own opinion as that of others.  Accordingly, I have collected the various remarks of connoisseurs, which  were scattered through the pages of history; but I have not always cited  my authorities, lest I should add too much to the dimensions of my  book;[19] nor have I regarded their opinion when they seemed to me to  have been influenced by prejudice. I have availed myself of the  observations of some approved critics, like Borghini, Fresnoy,  Richardson, Bottari, Algarotti, Lazzarini, and Mengs; with others who  have rather criticised our painters than written their lives. I have  also respected the opinions of living critics, by consulting different  professors in Italy: to them I have submitted my manuscript; I have  followed their advice, especially when it related to design, or any  other department of painting, in which artists are almost the only  adequate judges. I have conversed with many connoisseurs, who, in some  points, are not less skilful than the professors of the art, and are  even consulted by artists with advantage; as, for instance, on the  suitableness of the subject, on the propriety of the invention and the  expression, on the imitation of the antique, on the truth of the  colouring. Nor have I failed to study the greatest part of the best  productions of the schools of Italy; and to inform myself in the  different cities what rank their least known painters hold among their  connoisseurs; persuaded, as I am, that the most accurate opinion of any  artist is formed where the greatest number of his works are to be seen,  and where he is most frequently spoken of by his fellow citizens and by  strangers. In this way, also, I have been enabled to do justice to the  merits of several artists who had been passed over, either because the  historian of their school had never beheld their productions, or had  merely met with some early and trivial specimens in one city, being  unacquainted with the more perfect and mature specimens they had  produced elsewhere.    Notwithstanding my diligence I do not presume to offer this as a work to  which much might not be added. It has never happened that a history,  embracing so many objects, is at once produced perfect; though it may  gradually be rendered so. The history earliest in point of time,  becomes, in the end, the least in authority; and its greatest merit is  in having paved the way to more finished performances. Perfection is  still less to be expected in a compendium. The reader is here presented  with the names of many artists and authors; but many others might have  been admitted, whom want of leisure or opportunity, but not of respect,  has obliged us to omit. Here he will find a variety of opinions; but to  these many others might have been added. There is no man, of whom all  think alike. Baillet, just before mentioned, is a proof of this, with  regard to writers on literary subjects; and he who thinks the task  worthy of his pains might demonstrate it much more fully with respect to  different painters. Each judges by principles peculiar to himself:  Bonarruoti stigmatized as drivelling, Pietro Perugino and Francia, both  luminaries of the art; Guido, if we may credit history, was disapproved  of by Cortona; Caravaggio by Zucchero; Guercino by Guido; and, what  seems more extraordinary, Domenichino by most of the artists who  flourished at Rome, when he painted his finest pictures.[20] Had these  artists written of their rivals they either would have condemned them,  or spoken less favourably of them than unprejudiced individuals. Hence  it is that connoisseurs will frequently be found to approach nearer the  truth, in forming their estimate, than artists; the former adopt the  impartial feelings of the public, while the latter allow themselves to  be influenced by motives of envy or of prejudice. Innumerable similar  disputes are still maintained concerning several artists, who, like  different kinds of aliment, are found to be disagreeable or grateful to  different palates. To hold the happy mean, exempted from all party  spirit, is as impossible as to reconcile the opinions of mankind, which  are as multifarious as are the individuals of the species.    Amid such discrepancy of opinion I have judged it expedient to avoid the  most controverted points; in others, to subscribe to the decision of the  majority; to allow to each his particular opinion;[21] but not, if  possible, to disappoint the reader, desirous of learning what is most  authentic and generally received. Ancient writers appear to have pursued  this plan when treating of the professors of any art, in which they  themselves were mere amateurs; nor could it arise from any other  circumstance that Cicero, Pliny, and Quintilian, express themselves upon  the Greek artists in the same manner. Their opinions coincide, because  that of the public was unanimous. I am aware that it is difficult to  obtain the opinion of the public concerning the more modern artists, but  it is not difficult with regard to those on whom much has been already  written. I am also aware that public opinion accords not at all times  with truth, because \"it often happens to incline to the wrong side of  the question.\" This, however, is a rare occurrence in the fine arts,[22]  nor does it militate against an historian who aims more at fidelity of  narrative, and impartiality of public opinion, than the discussion of  the relative merit or correctness of tastes.    My work is divided into six volumes; and I commence by treating in the  two first volumes of that part of Italy, which, through the genius of Da  Vinci, Michelangiolo, and Raffaello, became first conspicuous, and first  exhibited a decided character in painting. Those artists were the  ornaments of the Florentine and Roman schools, from which I proceed to  two others, the Sienese and Neapolitan. About the same time Giorgione,  Tiziano, and Coreggio, began to flourish in Italy; three artists, who as  much advanced the art of colouring, as the former improved design; and  of these luminaries of Upper Italy I treat in the third and fourth  volumes; since the number of the names of artists, and the many  additions to this new impression, have induced me to devote two volumes  to their merits. Then follows the school of Bologna, in which the  attempt was made to unite the excellences of all the other schools: this  commences the fifth volume; and on account of proximity it is succeeded  by that of Ferrara, and Upper and Lower Romagna. The school of Genoa,  which was late in acquiring celebrity, succeeds, and we conclude with  that of Piedmont, which, though it cannot boast so long a succession of  artists as those of the other states, has merits sufficient to entitle  it to a place in a history of painting. Thus the five most celebrated  schools will be treated of in the order in which they arose; in like  manner as the ancient writers on painting began with the Asiatic school,  which was followed by the Grecian, and this last was subdivided into the  Attic and Sicyonian; to which in process of time succeeded the Roman  school.[23] The sixth and last volume contains an ample index to the  whole, quite indispensable to render the work more extensively useful,  and to give it its full advantage. In assigning artists to any school I  have paid more regard to other circumstances than the place of their  nativity; to their education, their style, their place of residence in  particular, and the instruction of their pupils: circumstances, indeed,  which are sometimes found so blended and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#5)"],[1,"wolves are left undisturbed to breed in  neighboring sections, and the depleted country is soon restocked.\"    \"A floating class of hunters and trappers receive most of the bounty  money and drift to the sections where the bounty is highest. If  extermination is left to these men, it will be a long process. Even  some of the small ranch owners support themselves in part from the  wolf harvest, and it is not uncommon to hear men boast that they know  the location of dens, but are leaving the young to grow up for higher  bounty. The frauds, which have frequently wasted the funds  appropriated for the destruction of noxious animals almost vitiate  the wolf records of some of the States: If bounties resulted in the  extermination of the wolves or in an important reduction in their  number, the bounty system should be encouraged, but if it merely  begets fraud and yields a perpetual harvest for the support of a  floating class of citizens, other means should be adopted.\"      [Illustration: Grey Wolf, the Kind on Which Bounty is Paid.]    The failure of bounties to accomplish their proposed object was  clearly shown by Dr. T. S. Palmer in 1896. Under the heading, \"What  have bounties accomplished,\" he says:    \"Advocates of the bounty system seem to think that almost any species  can be exterminated in a short time if the premiums are only high  enough. Extermination, however, is not a question of months, but of  years, and it is a mistake to suppose that it can be accomplished  rapidly except under extraordinary circumstances, as in the case of  the buffalo and the fur seal. Theoretically, a bounty should be high  enough to insure the destruction of at least a majority of the  individuals during the first season, but it has already been shown  that scarcely a single State has been able to maintain a high rate  for more than a few months, and it is evident that the higher the  rate, the greater the danger of fraud. Although Virginia has  encouraged the killing of wolves almost from the first settlement of  the colony, and has sometimes paid as high as $25 apiece for their  scalps, wolves were not exterminated until about the middle of this  (the past) century, or until the rewards had been in force for more  than two hundred years. Nor did they become extinct in England until  the beginning of the sixteenth century, although efforts toward their  extermination had been begun in the reign of King Edgar (959-975).  France, which has maintained bounties on these animals for more than  a century, found it necessary to increase the rewards to $30 and $40  in 1882, and in twelve years expended no less than $115,000 for  nearly 8,000 wolves.\"    \"The larger animals are gradually becoming rare, particularly in the  East, but it can not be said that bounties have brought about the  extermination of a single species in any State.\"    \"New Hampshire has been paying for bears about as long as Maine, but  in 1894 the State treasurer called attention to the large number  reported by four or five of the towns, and added that should the  other 231 towns 'be equally successful in breeding wild animals for  the State market, in proportion to their tax levy, it would require a  State tax levy of nearly $2,000,000 to pay the bounty claims' Even  New York withdrew the rewards on bears in 1895, not because they had  become unnecessary, but because the number of animals killed  increased steadily each year.\"    \"Wolf skins are often ruined by the requirements of bounty laws,  especially when the head, feet, or ears are cut off. The importance  of preserving the skins in condition to bring the highest market  price is as great as that of making it impossible to collect bounties  twice. A slit in the skin can be sewed up so that it will never show  on the fur side, but can not be concealed on the inside. A single  longitudinal or vertical slit, or double or cross slits 4 inches  long, in the center where the fur is longest, would serve every  purpose of the law without seriously impairing the market value of  the skin.\"    One thing that is detrimental to the success of the bounty system, is  the invariable \"red tape\" connected with such laws. In some states  the bounty regulations are so complicated and so exacting, that  trappers do not care to follow \"wolfing\" because of the trouble in  securing the bounty money.    It would be impossible, in a work of this kind, to give the bounty  laws of the different states, also as they are repealed so  frequently, detailed information on that subject would be of little  value to the prospective hunter or trapper. We give, however, an  outline of the regulations in some of the principal wolf states.    The State of Wyoming pays a bounty of five dollars each on timber  wolves and mountain lions, and one dollar and twenty-five cents for  each coyote. In addition to this, there are both county and  stockmen's bounties in certain parts of the state. Some ranchmen  offer as much as forty-five dollars each, for grey wolves caught on  their ranches.    In order to secure the state bounty, one must present the entire skin  to the County Clerk, or Notary Public, of the county in which the  animal was killed, and accompanied by affidavit to the effect that  the animal was killed in that county, by the person presenting the  skin, on or after March 1st, 1909. The skin must have the feet and  upper jaw or head, with both upper and lower lips attached. The head  will then be cut off and destroyed by the county official. Applicants  for bounty must be identified.    With regard to private bounties, one should consult the county  officials, but these, and in that case, the state bounty also, are as  a rule, paid by the treasurer of the association offering the bounty.    Wisconsin pays twenty dollars on old wolves and eight dollars each on  pups. Half of this bounty money is paid by the state and the other  half by the county. In order to secure it, the trapper must take the  carcass of the animal to the Town Chairman and remove the scalp in  his presence. He gives a certificate to that effect and the bounty  claimant presents the scalp and certificate to the County Clerk, who  destroys the scalp and gives an order to the County Treasurer for  one-half of the bounty. The County Clerk also sends an affidavit to  the State Treasurer, stating that you have presented the scalp and it  has been destroyed and the claimant then receives the balance of the  bounty money from the state.    In the State of Washington the bounty is fifteen dollars on timber  wolves and one dollar on coyotes. The method of procuring the bounty  as given here is copied direct from the game law pamphlet:    \"Upon the production to the county auditor of any county of the  entire hide or pelt and right fore leg to the knee joint intact of  any cougar, lynx, wild cat, coyote or timber wolf, killed in such  county, each of which hides or pelts shall show two ears, eye holes,  skin to tip of nose, and right fore leg to the knee join intact, the  county auditor shall require satisfactory proof that such animal was  killed in such county. When the county auditor is satisfied that such  animal was killed in his county, he shall cut from such hide or pelt  the bone of the right fore leg to the knee as aforesaid which shall  be burned in the presence of such auditor and one other county  official, who shall certify to the date and place of such burning.\"    Utah pays a bounty of ten dollars on grey wolves and two dollars and  fifty cents on coyotes. The entire skin, with tail, feet and the  bones of the leg, to the knee, must be presented to the County Clerk  within sixty days of the date on which said animal was killed. The  County Clerk must then remove and destroy the bones of the legs and  the applicant will sign an affidavit stating that the animal was  killed by himself, in that county and within sixty days prior to that  date.    The county official will then send a certified statement to the State  Auditor, along with the other papers, who, after same have been  examined, will transmit the bounty money to the claimant.    No bounty will be paid on the skin of a grey wolf until it has been  seen and passed upon by the board of county commissioners at their  first regular meeting. Bounty claimants must be identified by a  reputable citizen and tax payer of the county.    In Minnesota the bounty on grown wolves is seven dollars and fifty  cents and one dollar for wolf pups. The bounty regulations are  practically the same as in the other states; the entire skin with  head and ears intact must be presented to the Town Clerk within  thirty days and the applicant must take affidavit as to the date and  place of the killing.    In other states, if our information is correct, the bounties at  present (1909) are as follows:                ADULT WOLVES. YOUNG WOLVES. COYOTES.      Arizona         $10 00                  $2 00    Arkansas          5 00    Colorado          5 00                   1 00    Idaho            10 00?                  1 00?    Kansas            5 00                   1 00    Michigan         25 00        $10 00    Montana          10 00                   3 00    Nebraska          4 00                   1 25    New Mexico       20 00                   2 00    North Dakota      4 50                   2 50    Oregon           10 00                   7 00    South Dakota      5 00                   1 50    THE CANADIAN PROVINCES.
