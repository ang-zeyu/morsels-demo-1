The commissary, who had seemed so calm when he first came, now looked  grave and perplexed. The moment for taking a decisive part had come, yet  it was evident that he hesitated.    \"You see, gentlemen,\" he began, \"our search has only confirmed our first  suspicion.\"    M. Fauvel and Prosper bowed assentingly.    \"And what do you think, M. Fanferlot?\" continued the commissary.    Fanferlot did not answer.    Occupied in studying the safe-lock, he manifested signs of a lively  surprise. Evidently he had just made an important discovery.    M. Fauvel, Prosper, and the commissary rose, and surrounded him.    \"Have you discovered any trace?\" said the banker, eagerly.    Fanferlot turned around with a vexed air. He reproached himself for not  having concealed his impressions.    \"Oh!\" said he, carelessly, \"I have discovered nothing of importance.\"    \"But we should like to know,\" said Prosper.    \"I have merely convinced myself that this safe has been recently opened  or shut, I know not which, with great violence and haste.\"    \"Why so?\" asked the commissary, becoming attentive.    \"Look, monsieur, at this scratch near the lock.\"    The commissary stooped down, and carefully examined the safe; he saw  a light scratch several inches long that had removed the outer coat of  varnish.    \"I see the scratch,\" said he, \"but what does that prove?\"    \"Oh, nothing at all!\" said Fanferlot. \"I just now told you it was of no  importance.\"    Fanferlot said this, but it was not his real opinion.    This scratch, undeniably fresh, had for him a signification that escaped  the others. He said to himself, \"This confirms my suspicions. If the  cashier had stolen millions, there was no occasion for his being in  a hurry; whereas the banker, creeping down in the dead of night with  cat-like footsteps, for fear of awakening the boy in the ante-room,  in order to rifle his own money-safe, had every reason to tremble, to  hurry, to hastily withdraw the key, which, slipping along the lock,  scratched off the varnish.\"    Resolved to unravel by himself the tangled thread of this mystery, the  detective determined to keep his conjectures to himself; for the same  reason he was silent as to the interview which he had overheard between  Madeleine and Prosper.    He hastened to withdraw attention from the scratch upon the lock.    \"To conclude,\" he said, addressing the commissary, \"I am convinced that  no one outside of the bank could have obtained access to this room. The  safe, moreover, is intact. No suspicious pressure has been used on the  movable buttons. I can assert that the lock has not been tampered with  by burglar's tools or false keys. Those who opened the safe knew the  word, and possessed the key.\"    This formal affirmation of a man whom he knew to be skilful ended the  hesitation of the commissary.    \"That being the case,\" he replied, \"I must request a few moments'  conversation with M. Fauvel.\"    \"I am at your service,\" said the banker.    Prosper foresaw the result of this conversation. He quietly placed his  hat on the table, to show that he had no intention of attempting to  escape, and passed into the adjoining room.    Fanferlot also went out, but not before the commissary had made him a  sign, and received one in return.    This sign signified, \"You are responsible for this man.\"    The detective needed no admonition to make him keep a strict watch. His  suspicions were too vague, his desire for success was too ardent, for  him to lose sight of Prosper an instant.    Closely following the cashier, he seated himself in a dark corner of the  room, and, pretending to be sleepy, he fixed himself in a comfortable  position for taking a nap, gaped until his jaw-bone seemed about to be  dislocated, then closed his eyes, and kept perfectly quiet.    Prosper took a seat at the desk of an absent clerk. The others were  burning to know the result of the investigation; their eyes shone with  curiosity, but they dared not ask a question.    Unable to refrain himself any longer, little Cavaillon, Prosper's  defender, ventured to say:    \"Well, who stole the money?\"    Prosper shrugged his shoulders.    \"Nobody knows,\" he replied.    Was this conscious innocence or hardened recklessness? The clerks  observed with bewildered surprise that Prosper had resumed his usual  manner, that sort of icy haughtiness that kept people at a distance, and  made him so unpopular in the bank.    Save the death-like pallor of his face, and the dark circles around  his swollen eyes, he bore no traces of the pitiable agitation he had  exhibited a short time before.    Never would a stranger entering the room have supposed that this young  man idly lounging in a chair, and toying with a pencil, was resting  under an accusation of robbery, and was about to be arrested.    He soon stopped playing with the pencil, and drew toward him a sheet of  paper upon which he hastily wrote a few lines.    \"Ah, ha!\" thought Fanferlot the Squirrel, whose hearing and sight were  wonderfully good in spite of his profound sleep, \"eh! eh! he makes his  little confidential communication on paper, I see; now we will discover  something positive.\"    His note written, Prosper folded it carefully into the smallest possible  size, and after furtively glancing toward the detective, who remained  motionless in his corner, threw it across the desk to little Cavaillon  with this one word:    \"Gypsy!\"    All this was so quickly and skilfully done that Fanferlot was  confounded, and began to feel a little uneasy.    \"The devil take him!\" said he to himself; \"for a suffering innocent this  young dandy has more pluck and nerve than many of my oldest customers.  This, however, shows the result of education!\"    Yes: innocent or guilty, Prosper must have been endowed with great  self-control and power of dissimulation to affect this presence of mind  at a time when his honor, his future happiness, all that he held dear in  life, were at stake. And he was only thirty years old.    Either from natural deference, or from the hope of gaining some ray of  light by a private conversation, the commissary determined to speak to  the banker before acting decisively.    \"There is not a shadow of doubt, monsieur,\" he said, as soon as they  were alone, \"this young man has robbed you. It would be a gross neglect  of duty if I did not secure his person. The law will decide whether he  shall be released, or sent to prison.\"    The declaration seemed to distress the banker.    He sank into a chair, and murmured:    \"Poor Prosper!\"    Seeing the astonished look of his listener, he added:    \"Until to-day, monsieur, I have always had the most implicit faith in  his honesty, and would have unhesitatingly confided my fortune to his  keeping. Almost on my knees have I besought and implored him to confess  that in a moment of desperation he had taken the money, promising him  pardon and forgetfulness; but I could not move him. I have loved  him; and even now, in spite of the trouble and humiliation that he is  bringing upon me, I cannot bring myself to feel harshly toward him.\"    The commissary looked as if he did not understand.    \"What do you mean by humiliation, monsieur?\"    \"What!\" said M. Fauvel, excitedly; \"is not justice the same for all?  Because I am the head of a bank, and he only a clerk, does it follow  that my word is more to be relied upon than his? Why could I not have  robbed myself? Such things have been done. They will ask me for facts;  and I shall be compelled to expose the exact situation of my house,  explain my affairs, disclose the secret and method of my operations.\"    \"It is true, monsieur, that you will be called upon for some  explanation; but your well-known integrity--\"    \"Alas! He was honest, too. His integrity has never been doubted.  Who would have been suspected this morning if I had not been able to  instantly produce a hundred thousand crowns? Who would be suspected if I  could not prove that my assets exceed my liabilities by more than three  millions?\"    To a strictly honorable man, the thought, the possibility of suspicion  tarnishing his fair name, is cruel suffering. The banker suffered, and  the commissary of police saw it, and felt for him.    \"Be calm, monsieur,\" said he; \"before the end of a week justice  will have collected sufficient proof to establish the guilt of this  unfortunate man, whom we may now recall.\"    Prosper entered with Fanferlot, whom they had much trouble to awaken,  and with the most stolid indifference listened to the announcement of  his arrest.    In response, he calmly said:    \"I swear that I am innocent.\"    M. Fauvel, much more disturbed and excited than his cashier, made a last  attempt.    \"It is not too late yet, poor boy,\" he said: \"for Heaven's sake  reflect----\"    Prosper did not appear to hear him. He drew from his pocket a small key,  which he laid on the table, and said:    \"Here is the key of your safe, monsieur. I hope for my sake that you  will some day be convinced of my innocence; and I hope for your sake  that the conviction will not come too late.\"    Then, as everyone was silent, he resumed:    \"Before leaving I hand over to you the books, papers, and accounts  necessary for my successor. I must at the same time inform you that,  without speaking of the stolen three hundred and fifty thousand francs,  I leave a deficit in cash.\"    \"A deficit!\" This ominous word from the lips of a cashier fell like a  bombshell upon the ears of Prosper's hearers.    His declaration was interpreted in divers ways.    \"A deficit!\" thought the commissary: \"how, after this, can his guilt be  doubted? Before stealing this whole contents of the safe, he has kept  his hand in by occasional small thefts.\"    \"A deficit!\" said the detective to himself, \"now, no doubt, the very  innocence of this poor devil gives his conduct an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#5)"],[1,"                       {Messena quail    {Mexico.                 {ridgewayi          Masked Bobwhite  {Northwestern Sonora,               {                                    {Mexico.               {    Colinus    {                                    {Introduced and               {                                    {acclimated in               {virginianus        Bobwhite         {Washington and Oregon                                                    {and the islands                                                    {of Puget Sound.          THE WILD TURKEY      If there is any member of the feathered tribe entitled  to the designation of royal game bird, it is the wild turkey. This  magnificent bird, whose size and cunning challenges at once the  admiration and the skill of the sportsman, is a native of North and  Central America, and found in its wild state in no other part of the  globe. The ocellated turkey, the Central American species, is even  more gaudy in plumage than the peacock, but as it is not found within  the territorial scope of these articles, I shall leave its resplendent  colors to scintillate in its own tropic sun, undescribed.    Of the North American turkeys the scientist recognizes four varieties.  The =Meleagris sylvestris= of the eastern states, except Florida, the  =Meleagris sylvestris osceola= of Florida, the =Meleagris sylvestris  elliotti= of the Rio Grande district of southern Texas and  northeastern Mexico, and the =Meleagris gallopavo= of Arizona, New  Mexico, part of Colorado, and west and south through the larger  portion of old Mexico. It is of this last species that I shall write.        [Illustration: WILD TURKEY (Meleagris gallopavo)]      THE MEXICAN WILD TURKEY    (Meleagris gallopavo)    Outside of the progenitors of our common barnyard fowl, there is no  wild bird that mankind has domesticated whose distribution in its  domestic state has become so wide as that of the wild turkey, and none  have been so highly prized as an article of food. It is from the  Mexican wild turkey, =Meleagris gallopavo=, that all of our domestic  turkeys have descended. First captured in Mexico by the early settlers  of that country, they were taken to the West Indies and there  domesticated as early as 1527, for Oviedo, in his \"Natural History of  the Indias,\" speaks of the wild turkey having been taken from Mexico  to the islands and there being bred in a domestic state. From the West  Indies they were taken to Spain, France and England, and again brought  back to America as domestic fowls. In 1541 they must have been scarce  yet in England, for in an edict promulgated by Cranmer in that year,  the \"turkey cocke\" was named as one of \"the greater fowles,\" and which  \"an ecclesiastic was to have but one in a dishe.\" By 1573, however,  they must have become quite plentiful, for in that year Tusser  mentions them as the most approved \"Christmas husbandlie fare.\"    Inasmuch as there were no settlements of either English, French or  Spanish in America north of Mexico until 1584, or in that section of  the country inhabited by the eastern species of wild turkey until  sixty years after the turkey is known to have been introduced into  England, the common belief that the eastern species (=Meleagris  sylvestris=) was the foundation of the domestic turkey is clearly an  error; but the ornithologist does not find it necessary to consult  history to determine the origin of the domestic turkey. That  distinguishing feature of the Mexican wild turkey (=Meleagris  gallopavo=), the broad, light sub-terminal of the rump feathers, is so  strong that even after three and a half centuries of domestication,  changes in color through selection in breeding, and possibly crossing  to some extent with the eastern and Florida species, those markings,  peculiar to it alone, are unmistakably present even in the  lightest-colored varieties.    As a game bird the turkey has but few equals. Like most of game birds  they are comparatively tame and unsuspicious until after they have  been hunted, and learned that of all animals man is their greatest foe  and most to be dreaded, for whenever he is within sight he is within  the range of his instruments of destruction. I have seen the Mexican  wild turkey constantly running or flushing in front of us from morning  till night as we traveled through their country for days. They showed  but little fear, for while we killed all we could eat, we were  constantly traveling, so that those that had been introduced to the  white man's methods of destroying were left behind us, and those in  front of us had yet the lesson to learn; but when the wild turkey has  been hunted a little it becomes about as wary, cunning and resourceful  as any bird that flies.    The Mexican wild turkey is the largest of the race, and has been, and is  yet, the most plentiful. They are strictly mountain dwellers, not often  found in altitudes of less than twenty-five hundred to three thousand  feet, and more frequently from four to six thousand, and even up to  eight thousand feet or more. They are strictly timber dwellers, usually,  if not always, living in the pine forests, for I can not call to mind a  single instance where I have found them except where pines of some  variety were the principal trees. In size, individuals vary a good deal.  So, also, will the general average be found to vary as much as ten  pounds in different localities. Generally the higher their habitat the  larger the birds, some of the old gobblers reaching forty pounds if not  more. I remember killing one in the Sierra Madres of northern Mexico  that I carried about three miles into camp over a very rough country. By  the time I got him there I was willing to bet my last \"silver 'dobe\"  that he weighed a ton. I have also killed some very large ones in the  San Francisco mountains of Arizona.    The wild turkey, like the mountain quail, has an up and down mountain  migration. In the early spring the hens begin to work up the mountains  and seek the densest jungles, and of course the gobblers follow them.  The gobblers are polygamous, and have but little respect for their  families. They will not only destroy the nests, but even the young  birds. For this reason the hens are very secretive in nesting, taking  as much care in hiding them away from the gobblers as from their other  enemies. As soon as the hens begin setting the gobblers gather in  flocks and remain by themselves until joined in the early fall by the  hens and their half-grown broods. After this the flocks soon begin  their migration to the lower hills and mountain openings, and  congregate into immense roosts. Places were once to be seen where they  had filled the trees for acres in such numbers as to break the limbs  in many instances. In those times and localities they were too tame  and too plentiful to afford much amusement to the man who hunted them  for sport, but with the exception of some places in Mexico that day  has passed, and the sportsman who hunts these grand game birds now  will find a quarry worthy of his skill and affording him sufficient  exertion to whet his appetite for the delicious feast they furnish  him.    Both the habits and the habitat of the wild turkey make the sport of  hunting them especially enjoyable. As soon as the gobblers are  deserted by the hens they become more wary, and the crack of a twig or  the sight of a man, be he ever so far away, and they at once seek  cover. Then the keen eye and the noiseless tread of the still hunter  is called upon for his best and most careful efforts, for the eyes of  these gobblers are quick to catch the slightest move and their ears  acute to the faintest sound. The curiosity of a deer often makes him  hesitate long enough for the opportunity of a shot, but the gobbler,  after the hens have left him, is no longer lured by curiosity. His  business is to keep out of sight, and he can do it, after he has once  learned the destructiveness of man, just a little more successfully  than any other bird or animal that I have ever hunted.    There are no wild turkeys west of the Colorado river, nor on the  peninsula of Lower California; but there can be no reason to doubt  that, had the mountains of Arizona connected with the pines of the  Coast range in San Bernardino county or with the Sierras of Inyo or  Kern, the mountains of California would have been as well supplied  with turkey as are its valleys with quail.    =Color=--The color of the wild turkey varies very much except in those  that are found in the higher mountains and far away from civilization.  Domestication of over three hundred and fifty years has not yet robbed  the turkey of its love for the wild and they are often seen long  distances away from the farms feeding contentedly. In countries where  the wild turkey still existed these tame varieties of various colors  have mixed with them, often to such an extent as to change the color  very materially. I have seen flocks in Mexico ranging close to ranch  houses with turkeys among them so light-colored that they were no  doubt tame birds that had wandered away with their wild progenitors.    The wild turkey of Mexico, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado is a dark  bronze bird with a light-colored rump, caused by the upper tail  coverts being tipped with a broad subterminal band of white, narrowly  tipped with black. The tail feathers are dark brown, spotted with  black and tipped with white.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest of the wild turkey is generally in a  depression in the ground, high up on the mountains, and carefully  hidden away in some dense thicket. I cannot call to mind ever seeing  but two nests. One of these had but seven eggs while the other had  seventeen. The markings are the same as those of the tame turkey.    =Measurements=--The total length varies from three to four and a half  feet; wing 18 to 24 inches.
