[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#5)"],[1," flowers on her mother's dinner-table will after marriage cheerfully do  quite distasteful housework in the place she calls her own.    This passionate love of home is one of the most marked feminine  characteristics; I don't mean love of being _at_ home, as modern women's  tastes frequently lie elsewhere, but love of the place itself and the  desire to possess it. A great number of women marry solely to obtain  this coveted possession. As for those who don't, the advertisement  columns of the _Church Times_, the _Christian World_, and other papers  tell a pitiful story of their need. Ladies 'by birth' (pathetic and  foolish little phrase!) are willing to do almost anything in return for  just a modest corner, a very subordinate place even in someone else's  home. They will be housekeepers, servants, companions, secretaries,  helps for 'a small salary and a home,' and sometimes for no salary at  all. They will pack, sew, mend, teach, supervise; they offer their  knowledge of every kind, such as it is, their music, their languages,  their health and strength, their subservience and all their virtues,  real or acquired--all in return for a little food and fire, and the  sheltering of four walls, which constitute their extreme need, their  utmost desire--a home! Beautiful women, gifted and good women, sell  themselves daily just to gain a home. Even Hedda Gabler, most degenerate  of modern heroines, who shot herself rather than be a mother, sold  herself in a loveless marriage only for a home. And yet constantly we  read a list of trivial and fantastic reasons why women don't marry!    A girl-bachelor who was compelled to spend most of her time in that  uncomfortable place technically known as 'one's boxes,' once told me  that her greatest desire was a spot just big enough for a wardrobe in  which to keep her spare clothes and little possessions. She did without  a home, but she longed intensely for that wardrobe. 'I shall have to  marry Tony soon,' she said, 'just for the convenience of having room for  my clothes. I don't like him, and I want to wait till someone I do like  comes, but if ever I take him, it will be for wardrobe room, you just  see.' I must add that 'someone' _did_ come, and she now possesses  several wardrobes and three bouncing babies, and Tony cuts her when he  meets her in the Park!    This home passion is even more noticeable in that class of society  usually referred to as the lower. I have occasionally employed a poor  woman who has been in service as cook since her husband died nineteen  years ago. All that time, she has 'kept on the home,' _i.e._ a single  room which contains her furniture. She has scarcely ever had to use the  room, except for an odd day or two, and has had to spend much of her  scanty leisure in cleaning it. For nineteen years she has paid  three-and-six a week for the room sooner than sell her furniture. The  L172 thus expended would have paid for the furniture over and over  again. The woman quite realises the absurdity of it, but 'I simply  couldn't part with the 'ome,' is her explanation.    Yet another instance. Once when staying in seaside lodgings, I had the  misfortune to break a homely vessel of thick blue glass which had  evidently begun life as a fancy jam jar, but had been relegated, for  some reason obscure to me, to the proud position of mantel 'ornament,'  if that be the term. To my surprise the worthy landlady wept bitterly  over the pieces, and when I spoke of gorgeous objects wherewith to  replace her treasure, explained snappishly: 'Nothing won't make it good  to me! Why, that there blue vorse was the beginning of the 'ome!'    I must ask pardon for this digression and return to the subject in hand.  The most depressing aspect of the question is that even if every man  over twenty-five were married there would be still an enormous number of  women left husbandless. This is really very serious, and is a condition  that gives rise to many evils. To make up for it as far as possible,  every man of sound health and in receipt of sufficient income ought to  marry. If it is merely 'not good' for man to be alone, then it is very  bad indeed for women! Every woman should have a man companion, a man to  live with--if only to take the tickets, carry the bags and get up in the  night to see what that noise is. Since society as at present constituted  does not countenance men and women living together for companionship,  then clearly every woman ought to have a husband!    Mr Bernard Shaw has written: 'Give women the vote and in five years  there will be a crushing tax on bachelors.' So there should be, subject  to certain qualifications of age and income; this is one of the many  matters in which we should take a lesson from the Japanese where all  bachelors over a certain age are taxed; in France too, a bill, to this  effect, is being discussed. At the time of writing, women are full of  anticipation of being speedily enfranchised, and there is a good deal of  talk about what use they will make of the vote. I regret to say that  although there have been some utterly idiotic threats to abolish that  boon to wives--the man's club--yet so far, with one exception, nothing  has appeared in print as to the advisability of taxing bachelors. The  exception is a very interesting anonymous novel called _Star of the  Morning_, which strongly advocates such a tax, among several other  thoughtful suggestions for political reform.    It is obviously only just that the man who is doing nothing for the  State in the way of rearing a family should be taxed to relieve the man  who is. We hear so much about the falling birth-rate, and the duty of  every married couple to have a family, yet everything is done to  discourage those who do. The professional man slaving to earn, say,  L1000 a year, and bring up three or four children for the State, is  taxed exactly as much as the bachelor in receipt of the same income who  does nothing at all for the State, and can even avoid the other taxes by  being a lodger, if he choose.    But even if we eventually get reasonable legislation, which would offer  rewards instead of additional burdens to those who do their share in  keeping up the birth-rate; even if a bachelor over twenty-five became as  rare an object in these islands as an old maid in a Mohammedan country,  still there would be this enormous superfluity of spinsters. Why is it?  Why should Great Britain be regarded as a paradise of old maids? Why  should we have more spinsters than other countries? Is it because our  colonies swallow up so many men? Then why can't they swallow up an equal  number of women? I should like this most important matter to be taken up  by the State and an Institution for Encouraging Marriage started under  State auspices. One of the duties of this institution would be to induce  numbers of suitable women to emigrate, so as to preserve the proper  balance of the sexes in the home country, and that every colonist might  have a chance to get a wife. I heard the other day of a very ordinary  colonial girl who had eleven men all wanting to marry her at once.  Eleven men! And yet there are scores of charming English girls who grow  old and soured without having had a single offer of marriage.    Another duty of the Institution for Encouraging Marriage would be to try  and reach and bring together the thousands of lonely middle-class men  and women in large towns, who are engaged at work all day and have no  means of meeting members of the opposite sex. I have just been reading  Francis Gribble's very interesting novel, _The Pillar of Cloud_, in  which he describes the existence of half a dozen girls in 'Stonor House'  one of those dreary barracks for homeless females engaged during the  day. The frantic desire of these girls to meet men of their own class is  painfully true, and this desire is not so much the outcome of young  women's natural tendency to cultivate young men, but because all such  men to them are possible husbands, and marriage is the only way out from  Stonor House and the joyless existence there.    In _The Pathway of the Pioneer_ published a few years ago, Dolf Wyllarde  breaks similar ground, but her young women are more morbid and less  frankly anxious to meet men with a view to matrimony. Both books,  however, give one a good idea of the cheerless, unnatural lives led by  young middle-class women, whose relatives, if any, are far away, and who  work for their living in large towns--condemned almost inevitably to  celibacy by these unfavourable social conditions.    That large numbers of daintily-bred women should be condemned to such an  existence is the strongest possible argument in favour of the  establishment of two French institutions, viz., strictly limited  families and the system of _dots_. Of late years, the former has been  largely adopted in England, and until the latter custom also becomes the  rule, the Institution for Encouraging Matrimony could take the matter in  hand. Two or three unusually sensible philanthropists have already given  their attention to this important subject, but any movement of this  nature at once assumes too much the aspect of a matrimonial agency to be  approved by the class for whose welfare it is destined. However, the  I.F.E.M. would have to deal with this obstacle and conceal its real  intentions under another name. I am sure if its object were sufficiently  wrapped-up that refined men and women could take advantage of it without  loss of self-respect--the response to such an institution by both sexes  would be enormous. A club, ostensibly for promoting social intercourse,  might be the solution, and subscription dances, concerts, organised  excursions would not be difficult to arrange, and would make a source of  brightness and interest in many drab lives. Country branches could be  started if the thing proved a success.
