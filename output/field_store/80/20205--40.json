One day I sighted a band of  antelope--these most beautiful and graceful animals. I tried to head  them off, in order to get within rifle-shot distance, and drifted  farther and farther away from camp until I must have strayed at least  five miles. Like a rebounding rubber ball, their four feet striking the  ground simultaneously, they fled until at last they faded from sight on  the horizon, engulfed in a shimmering wave of heat, the reflection from  a sun-scorched ground. Reluctantly I gave up the chase, as I could by  no means approach the game, although they could not have winded me.    In order to determine the direction of our camp, I ascended a little  hill, when I suddenly espied an Indian. He was in a sitting posture,  less than a quarter of a mile away. Apparently he was stark naked and  his face was turned away from me, for I saw his broad back where not  covered by his long hair glisten in the hot rays of the sun. His gun  was lying within reach of his right hand, but I could not see what he  was doing. On the impulse of the moment I dropped behind a flowering  cactus for concealment. Then I took counsel with myself and decided  that it would be too risky to return to camp as I had intended to do.  In that direction for a long distance the ground was gently rising and  most likely the Indian would have seen me. I thought it probable that  he had staked his horse out in some nearby gulch, and if seen I would  have been at his mercy, as perhaps he was also in touch with other  Indians of his tribe. I reasoned that I could not afford to make the  mistake of incurring the risk to stake my life on the chance of  escaping his observation. I had started out to hunt antelopes, but now  I coolly prepared myself to stalk an Indian warrior instead. I went  about it as if I were hunting a coyote. First of all, I ascertained the  direction of the wind, which was very light. It blew from the quarter  the Indian was in toward me. Next, lying on my stomach, I dug the large  flowering plant up, and holding it by its roots in front of myself, I  crawled toward my quarry, as a snake in the grass. Cautiously,  stealthily, avoiding the slightest noise, and always on the lookout for  snakes and thorns, I crept slowly on, making frequent halts to rest  myself. Twice the Indian turned his head and looked in my direction,  but apparently he did not perceive me. In this manner I came within  easy gunshot distance. Now I took my last rest, and with my knife dug a  hole in the ground and replanted my cactus shield firmly. Then I placed  my rifle in position to fire and drew a fine bead on the nape of his  neck.    \"Adios, Indian brave, prepare thy soul to meet the great Spirit in the  ever grassy meadows of the happy hunting grounds of eternity, for the  spider of thy fate is weaving the last thread in the web of thy doom!\"  My finger was coaxing the trigger, when a feeling of intense shame rose  fiercely in my breast. Was I, then, like unto this Indian, to take an  enemy's life from ambush? Up I jumped with a challenging shout, my gun  leveled, ready for the fight. \"Por Dios, amigo, amigo!\" cried the  frightened Indian, holding up his hands. \"No tengo dinero!\" (I have no  money. Don't shoot!) he begged, speaking to me in Spanish. Then I went  to him and learned that he belonged to a wagon train, traveling just  ahead of us. He was a full-blood Navajo, who had been made captive in a  Mexican raid into the Navajo country. The Mexicans used to capture many  Navajo pappooses and bring them up as bond servants or peons. This  Indian told me that he had been following the same band of antelopes as  myself, and on passing a beautiful hill of red ants, he yielded to  temptation and thought he would have his clothes examined and laundered  by the ants. These little insects are really very accommodating and  work without remuneration. At the same time he likewise took a sun bath  on the same liberal terms. This episode made me famous with every  Spanish freighter over the Santa Fe trail, from Kansas into New Mexico.    Just before we reached the Cimarron country, which is very hilly and is  drained by the Red River, and where we were out of all danger from  Indians, I had a narrow escape from death. I was in the lead of our  train and had crossed a muddy place in the road. I drove on without  noticing that I was leaving the other teams far behind. A wagon stuck  fast in the mire, which caused my companions a great deal of labor and  much delay. At last I halted to await the coming of the other teams.  Suddenly there fell a shot from the dense growth of a wild sunflower  copse. It missed my head by a very close margin and just grazed the ear  of one of the mules. I believe that if I had attempted to rejoin the  train then I would have been killed from ambush. Instead, I quickly  secured the brake of my wagon, then I unhooked the trace chains of the  mules and quieted them and lay down under the wagon, ready to defend  myself. I was, however, not further molested and my companions came  along after a while. They had heard the shot and thought it was I who  had fired it.          CHAPTER IV.    A STRANGE LAND AND STRANGER PEOPLE      We were now within the boundaries of the Territory of Colorado and  approaching the northern line of New Mexico. When we passed through  Trinidad, which was then a small adobe town, we met Don Emilio Cortez  again. He was at home in this vicinity and came for the express purpose  of persuading me to come with him. \"My good wife charged me to bring  her that little gringo,\" he said; \"she longs for an American son.\" \"Our  daughter, Mariquita, is now ten years of age, and has been asked in  marriage by Don Robusto Pesado, a very rich man. But the child is  afraid of him, as he is a mountain of flesh, weighing close on twelve  arrobas. Now we thought that two years hence thou wilt be seventeen  years old and a man very sufficient for our little Mariquita, who will  then, with God's favor, be a woman of twelve years. She will have a  large dowry of cattle and sheep, and as the saints have blessed us with  an abundance of land and chattels, thou art not required to provide.\"    I thanked Don Emilio very kindly, but was, of course, too young then to  entertain any thought of marrying. I was really sorry to disappoint  him, as he seemed to have formed a genuine attachment for me and was  seriously grieved by my refusal.    Rumor spreads its vagaries faster among illiterate people than among  the enlightened and educated. Therefore, it was said in New Mexico long  before our arrival there that Don Jose Lopez's outfit brought a young  American, the like of whom had never been known before. He was not  ignorant, as other Americans, for he not only spoke the Spanish, but he  could also read and write the Castillan language. It was well known  that most Americans were so stupid that they could not talk as well as  a Mexican baby of two years, and that often after years of residence  among Spanish people they were still ignorant of the language. And  would you believe it, but it was the sacred truth, this little  American, albeit a mere boy, had the strength of a man. He made that  big heathen Navajo brute Pancho, the mayordomo of Don Preciliano  Chavez, of Las Vegas, stand stark before him in his nakedness, with his  hands raised to Heaven and compelled him, under pain of instant death,  to say his Pater Noster and three Ave Marias. Others said that Don Jose  Lopez was a man of foresight and discretion and saw that the Indians  were on the warpath and very dangerous. Therefore, he prayed to his  patron saint for spiritual guidance and succor. San Miguel, in his  wisdom, sent this young American heretic, as undoubtedly it was best to  fight evil with evil. And when the devil, in the guise of a coyote, led  the Indians to the attack, then he was sorely wounded by the unerring  aim of the gringito's rifle.    Others said that Don Jose Lopez had set up a shrine for the image of  his renowned patron saint, San Miguel, in his provision wagon, which  was being driven by the American boy, and the boy took the bullet which  wounded the coyote so sorely out of the saint's mouth, who had bitten  the sign of the cross thereon. And the evil one, in the likeness of the  coyote, rolled in his agony on the grass when he was hit by the  cross-marked bullet. Of course, the grass took fire and very nearly  burned up the whole caravan.    Other people said they were not surprised to hear of miracles emanating  from the shrine of the patron saint of Don Jose. His grandfather had  whittled this famous image out of a cottonwood tree, whereon a saintly  Penitente had been crucified after the custom of the order of  Flagellants. This Penitente resembled the penitent thief who died on  the cross and entered Paradise with the Saviour in this, that he was  known to be a good horse thief, and as he had died on the cross on a  night of Good Friday, he surely went to Glory Everlasting. Don Jose's  grandfather made a pilgrimage with this image he had made to the City  of Mexico, to have the Archbishop bless it in the cathedral before  Santa Guadalupe. During the ceremony, it was said, there grew a fine  head of flaxen hair on the image and it received beautiful blue eyes.  And it had the miraculous propensity to ever after wink its eye in the  presence of a priest and at the approach of a Christ-hating Jew, it  would spit. This virtue saved much wealth for the family of Don Jose,  as they were ever put on their guard against Jewish peddlers.    The rumor that Don Jose Lopez had carried the household saint with him  in his wagon was at once contradicted and disproved by his wife, Dona  Mercedes. The lady declared that San Miguel had never left his shrine  in the patio of their residence except for the avowed purpose of making  rain. In seasons of protracted drouth, when crops and live stock suffer  for want of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#5)"],[1,"-dust, gleaming upon the golden spires of churches, seeking out  every dark and unwholesome corner with its noiseless step, and  dispensing with open hand its bounty of purity and warmth. Yet the  shadow was there, even on that fairest of Christmas Days,--and Mr.  Broadstreet knew it.    Throughout the day he was thoughtful and abstracted, and during the  following weeks he was observed to act in the most unaccountable  manner. On snowy evenings he would dodge out of the house without the  slightest warning, and return shortly after with damp boots and a  defeated air.    Upon the street-cars Mr. Broadstreet became famous that winter for his  obliging manner and pleasant ways with the employees. Indeed, he more  than once persisted in remaining on the platform with the conductor at  the imminent risk of freezing his ears and nose, until he was fairly  driven within doors.    Down town he behaved still more queerly, leaving the office long  before dark, and being discovered in the oddest places imaginable; now  diving into narrow courts, and up steep staircases, now plunging into  alleyways and no thoroughfares; and returning home late to dinner,  greatly exhausted, with little or no money in his pockets. In these  days, too, he began to talk about the sufferings of the poor, the  abuses of the liquor law, the need of strong, pure women to go among  the outcasts of our great, troubled city and perform Christlike deeds.    One bitter cold night he was much later than usual. It had been  snowing heavily, and his wife had begun to worry a little over the  absence of her husband, when she heard the click of his key in the  front door. When Mr. Broadstreet entered, sprinkled with snow from  head to foot, what was her amazement to see him standing there with  fur cap and gloves, and a glowing face, but no ulster!    \"Alonzo, Alonzo,\" she cried, from the head of the stairs, \"what will  you forget next? Where have you left it?\"    \"Why,\" said he simply, \"I've found the Discouraged Man. And the doctor  at the hospital says she'll get well, after all.\"          III    'LIJAH      Twilight, December twilight in a great city, cold gray and dismal. Up  town the dust collected in little ridges at the street corners, and  whirled alike into the faces of rich and poor, on their way home from  work. Down town the clerks in the big stores had gone out to their  suppers, leaving the boys to light up and rearrange the disheveled  counters for the final rush of evening customers. Around the markets  and in the toy-shops, however, there was little rest. Crowds of tired,  good-natured people staggered against each other and entangled  themselves in all sorts of projecting bundles which they carried under  their arms. Now and then a messenger or expressman would call out,  \"Clear the way there!\" in rich, jovial tones, while he bore his armful  of glistening, scarlet-dotted holly through the thickest of the crowd.  Even the night wind, which came scurrying down from the northwest  evidently bent on mischief, stopped a moment to rest among the boughs  of the mimic evergreen forest of fir and spruce along the sidewalks,  refreshed itself with their spicy fragrance, and stole away again,  gentler than before. And when, of all the year, should eyes be  brighter, hopes higher, voices merrier, even wind and winter air more  mild than on this blessed night?--for it was Christmas Eve.    \"B-r-r-r-r,\" shivered 'Lijah, trying to pull down the ragged ends of  his sleeves over his black wrist; \"dis yere's what I call right cold.  Gwine to snow 'fore mo'nin', for sho.'\"    Plunging a small shovel into the tin pail he was carrying, the old man  proceeded to scatter its contents, a sort of earthy gravel, along the  slippery rails of the horse-car track.    \"Hullo, 'Lijah!\" called a passing driver, with one hand on his brake  and the other holding a tight rein, \"where you goin' to-morrow?\"    \"Dunno; Merry Chris'mus!\" returned the other, straightening his old  back and waving a salute with his shovel.    One after another greeted him in much the same way, receiving the  invariable \"Merry Chris'mus,\" given with a broad smile and a momentary  gleam of white from eyes and teeth.    The pail was empty, and 'Lijah was about to leave the scene of his  day's work, when a strong, young voice called to him.    \"Evening, 'Lijah. Wish you a Merry Christmas!\"    \"Thank ye, thank ye, mars' George,\" cried the negro, answering  involuntarily in the old plantation dialect, and turning delightedly  to the newcomer. \"Wh-whar you been, Mars,' an' how's Miss Rosy?\"    \"She's well, 'Lijah,\" said the young man, with a sparkle in his eye.  \"I've been away from the city for a month. To-night I was going up  there, but\"--    \"But what, but what, Mars' George?\" queried the old man eagerly. \"Ef a  po' ole nig kin do anything fer ye, he'll do it sho'. _Anything_,  Mars'!\"    George Farley looked at him kindly. \"I know you would, 'Lijah. And  yet, I hardly know--if I hadn't been away so long\"--    He was a generous young fellow, and he wanted to do right both by his  employers and his humble companion. The fact was, he had been charged  to remain in the store that night, the regular watchman being at home  sick. He had been looking forward during his long absence on the road  to that very Christmas Eve, which he was to spend with the owner of a  certain pair of merry brown eyes, at the other end of the city. The  temptation was too great. \"It won't come again for a year,\" he argued  to himself; \"it won't ever be just the same as to-night. One hour or  two would do no harm, and 'Lijah is as faithful as a watch-dog--better  than I would be, if anything.\"    The result was, as may easily be imagined, that 'Lijah agreed to take  up his post at the store at just half-past seven, and remain until  Farley came, which would be before ten.    The old man made his way home through the darkening streets with many  a delighted chuckle at his good luck. A chance to serve Mars' George  didn't come every day. \"He's a-gwine ter trus' me!\" he said to himself  over and over again.    The strong attachment between these two men, so far removed from each  other in social position, but closely knit together by that  brotherliness of humanity which reaches to a depth--or height--where  there is neither rich nor poor, bond nor free,--this powerful  attachment had begun at a summer hotel a year before. Farley had been  walking idly about the reading-rooms and office, when he heard a  cracked voice crooning softly to itself. Something in the tones  attracted him, and he was interested enough to listen for the words of  the song, for the tune told him nothing.        \"Wash me an' I shall be        Whiter dan snow.\"    Stepping into the next room he found the singer to be an old negro,  employed about the place to black boots, scrub floors, and perform  whatever menial duties were considered below the dignity of his  fellow-servants. His hair was powdered with white, and his face  wrinkled like a prune, but there was a light in his eye which told  that he was mindful of the words he sang. Farley was touched by their  association with both his race and the tasks to which he was put, and  entered into conversation with him. He found that 'Lijah, for so he  was called, was receiving a mere pittance from the hotel, and even  that would cease in a few weeks. Interesting himself thoroughly in the  old man, he obtained for him a comfortable boarding-place in the city  and a situation which befitted his years and sluggish movements, and,  while affording but small pay, gave steady work from one year's end to  another.    So 'Lijah plodded humbly up and down the tracks, scattering his  shovelfuls of sand, dodging passing vehicles as he best might, and  living at peace with all men. Oftentimes Mars' George, to whom, as his  only tie in the world, he was as devoted as a Newfoundland dog, would  spend the long winter evenings with him in his little room; or would  even take him to a fairy play, whose fascinations affected him so  powerfully that for days afterward he would occasionally be seen to  stop at his work, gazing steadfastly at the pavements, from which,  perhaps, he momentarily expected to see emerge a gnome or gauze-winged  naiad.    Meanwhile he was full of interest in all that most nearly concerned  the happiness of his friend and patron. Accordingly it was not long  after Miss Rosy Burnham appeared on the scene, that old 'Lijah took  occasion to slyly allude to the personal charms of the young lady, and  to offer his services as a message-bearer, whenever occasion might  arise.    Once 'Lijah had the supreme delight of nursing Farley through a short  but severe illness. Then it was that his musical accomplishments,  which had at first attracted his benefactor, again came into play. His  repertoire, it is true, was scant, including only \"Whiter than Snow,\"  which he had heard at one of Mr. Moody's revival meetings, and \"Swing  Low, Sweet Chariot,\" doubtless a relic of the old days when the slaves  sang at their work in the cotton fields, or among the huts at night.  Of tune he knew absolutely nothing, and the different airs which he  improvised for the words, according to the mood he was in, gave the  effect of a much greater variety than the two hymns would otherwise  have afforded.    To-night he was as happy as a child, and went to and fro about the  house humming, to a tune which seemed a combination of \"Dixie\" and  \"Coronation\"        \"Swing low,--swing low--      Comin' fer ter carry me ho-o-ome.\"    All the way down to the store after supper he murmured by turns \"Sweet  Chariot,\" and \"Mars' George done trus' me sho'ly!\" People noticed his  lightsome looks, and some one must have given him a sprig of holly,  which he wore proudly, after all the berries had dropped off, in his  buttonhole.    Arriving at the store he found Farley waiting impatiently for him, and  was at once instructed in the"]]]
