He was killed by idiotic fanciers of jugged  hare. His murderers, however, perished before the end of the year in the  most painful manner; for the death of a black cat, an eminently  cabalistic animal, never goes unavenged.    Gavroche, seized with a frantic love of freedom, or rather with a  sudden attack of vertigo, sprang out of the window one day, crossed the  street, climbed the fence of the Parc Saint-James, which faces our  house, and vanished. In spite of our utmost endeavours, we never managed  to hear of him again, and a shadow of mystery hangs over his fate; so  that the only survivor of the Black Dynasty is Eponine, who is still  faithful to her master and has become a thorough cat of letters.    Her companion now is a magnificent angora cat, whose gray and silver fur  recalls Chinese spotted porcelain. He is called Zizi, alias \"Too  Handsome to Work.\" The handsome fellow lives in a sort of contemplative  _kief_, like a theriaki under the influence of the drug, and makes one  think of \"The Ecstasies of Mr. Hochenez.\" Zizi is passionately fond of  music, and, not satisfied with listening to it, he indulges in it  himself. Sometimes, in the dead of night, when everybody is asleep, a  strange, fantastic melody, which the Kreislers and the musicians of the  future might well envy, breaks in upon the silence. It is Zizi walking  upon the key-board of the piano which has been left open, and who is at  once astonished and delighted at hearing the keys sing under his tread.    It would be unjust not to link with this branch Cleopatra, Eponine's  daughter, whose shy disposition keeps her from mingling in society. She  is of a tawny black, like Mummia, Atta-Croll's hairy companion, and her  two green eyes look like huge aqua-marines. She generally stands on  three legs, her fourth lifted up like a classical lion that has lost its  marble ball.    These be the chronicles of the Black Dynasty. Enjolras, Gavroche, and  Eponine recall to me the creations of a beloved master; only, when I  re-read \"Les Miserables,\" the chief characters in the novel seem to me  to be taken by black cats, a fact that in no wise diminishes the  interest I take in it.          IV    THIS SIDE FOR DOGS      I have often been charged with not being fond of dogs; a charge which  does not at first sight appear to be very serious, but which I  nevertheless desire to clear myself of, for it implies a certain amount  of dislike. People who prefer cats are thought by many to be cruel,  sensuous, and treacherous, while dog-lovers are credited with being  frank, loyal, and open-hearted,--in a word, possessed of all the  qualities attributed to the canine race. I in no wise deny the merits of  Medor, Turk, Miraut, and other engaging animals, and I am prepared to  acknowledge the truth of the axiom formulated by Charlet,--\"The best  thing about man is his dog.\" I have been the owner of several, and I  still own some. Should any of those who seek to discredit me come to my  house, they would be met by a Havana lap-dog barking shrilly and  furiously at them, and by a greyhound that very likely would bite their  legs for them. But my affection for dogs has an understratum of fear.  These excellent creatures, so good, so faithful, so devoted, so loving,  may go mad at any moment, and then they become more dangerous than a  lance-head snake, an asp, a rattlesnake or a cobra capella. This reacts  on my love for dogs. Then dogs strike me as a bit uncanny; they have  such a searching, intense glance; they sit down in front of you with so  questioning a look that it is fairly embarrassing. Goethe disliked that  glance of theirs that seems to attempt to incorporate man's soul within  itself, and he drove away dogs, saying, \"You shall not swallow my monad,  much as you may try.\"    The Pharamond of my canine dynasty was called Luther. He was a big white  spaniel, with liver spots, and handsome brown ears. He was a setter, had  lost his owner, and after looking for him a long time in vain, had taken  to living in my father's house at Passy. Not having partridges to go  after, he had taken to rat-hunting, and was as clever at it as a Scotch  terrier. At that time I was living in that blind alley of the Doyenne,  now destroyed, where Gerard de Nerval, Arsene Houssaye and Camille  Rogier were the heads of a little picturesque and artistic Bohemia, the  eccentric mode of life in which has been so well told by others that it  is unnecessary to relate it over again. There we were, right in the  centre of the Carrousel, as independent and solitary as on a desert  island in Oceanica, under the shadow of the Louvre, among the blocks of  stone and the nettles, close to an old ruinous church, with fallen-in  roof which looked most romantic in the moonlight. Luther, with whom I  was on a most friendly footing, seeing that I had finally abandoned the  paternal nest, made a point of coming to see me every morning. He  started from Passy, no matter what the weather was, came down the Quai  de Billy, the Cours-la-Reine, and reached my place at about eight  o'clock, just as I was waking. He used to scratch at the door, which was  opened for him, and he dashed joyously at me with yelps of joy, put his  paws on my knees, received with a modest and unassuming air the caresses  his noble conduct merited, took a look round the room, and started back  to Passy. On arriving there, he went to my mother, wagged his tail,  barked a little, and said as plainly as if he had spoken: \"I have seen  young master; don't worry; he is all right.\" Having thus reported to the  proper person the result of his self-imposed mission, he would drink up  half a bowlful of water, eat his food, lie down on the carpet by my  mother's chair,--for he entertained peculiar affection for her,--and  sleep for an hour or two after his long run. Now, how do people who  maintain that animals do not think and are incapable of putting two and  two together explain this morning visit, which kept up family relations  and brought to the home-nest news of the fledgeling that had so recently  left it?    Poor Luther's end was very sad. He became taciturn, morose, and one fine  morning bolted from the house, feeling the rabies on him and resolved  not to bite his masters; so he fled, and we have every reason to believe  that he was killed as a mad dog, for we never saw him again.    After a pretty long interregnum a new dog was brought into the house. It  was called Zamore, and was a sort of spaniel, of very mixed breed, small  in size, with a black coat, save the tan spots over his eyes and the tan  hair on his stomach. On the whole he was insignificant physically, and  ugly rather than handsome; but morally, he was a remarkable dog. He  absolutely despised women, would not obey them, never would follow them,  and never once did my mother or my sisters manage to win from him the  least sign of friendship or deference. He would accept their attentions  and the tit-bits they gave him with a superior air, but never did he  express any gratitude for them. Never would he yelp, never would he rap  the floor with his tail, never bestow on them a single one of those  caresses dogs are so fond of lavishing. He remained impassible in a  sphinx-like pose, like a serious man who will not take part in the  conversation of frivolous persons. The master he had elected was my  father, in whom he acknowledged the authority of the head of the house,  and whom he considered a mature and serious man. But his affection for  him was austere and stoical, and was not shown by gambadoes, larks, and  lickings. Only, he always kept his eyes upon him, followed his every  motion and kept close to heel, never allowing himself the smallest  escapade or the least nod to any passing comrades. My dear and lamented  father was a great fisherman before the Lord, and he caught more barbels  than Nimrod ever slew antelopes. It certainly could not be said of his  fishing-rod that it was a pole and string with a worm at one end and a  fool at the other, for he was a very clever man, and none the less he  daily filled his basket with fish. Zamore used to accompany him on his  trips, and during the long night-watches entailed by ground-line  fishing for the big fellows, he would stand on the very edge of the  water, apparently trying to fathom its dark depths and to follow the  movements of the prey. Although he often pricked up his ears at the  faint and distant sounds that, at night, are heard in the deepest  silence, he never barked, having understood that to be mute is a quality  indispensable in a fisherman's dog. In vain did Phoebe's alabaster brow  show above the horizon reflected in the sombre mirror of the river;  Zamore would not bay at the moon, although such prolonged ululation  gives infinite delight to creatures of his species. Only when the bell  on the set-line tinkled did he look at his master and allow himself one  short bark, knowing that the prey was caught; and he appeared to take  the greatest interest in the manoeuvres involved in the landing of a  three or four pound barbel.    No one would have suspected that under his calm, abstracted,  philosophical look, this dog, so serious that he was almost melancholy,  and despised all frivolity, nursed an overmastering, strange, never to  be suspected passion, absolutely contrary to his apparent moral and  physical character.    \"You do not mean,\" I hear my reader exclaim, \"that the good Zamore had  hidden vices?--that he was a thief?\" No. \"A libertine?\" No. \"That he  loved brandied cherries?\" No. \"That he bit people?\" Never. Zamore was  crazy about dancing. He was an artist devoted to the choregraphic art.    He became conscious of his vocation in the following manner. One day  there appeared on the square at Passy a gray moke,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#5)"],[1,"                          101    SECT.
