Dixon and Bum were evidently old friends; they reclined  with their heads together, occasionally laughing and whispering--a piece  of bad manners silently but strongly resented by the rest of the company.    \"I'll jist go an' have a squint at the carrion,\" remarked Mosey, at length,  with the inevitable adjective; and, passing through the broken fence,  he disappeared in the timber and old-man salt-bush.    \"Wants some o' the flashness took outen him,\" remarked Price,  in arrogant assertion of parental authority, yet glancing apprehensively  after Mosey as he spoke.    \"Should 'a' thought about that before,\" observed Cooper gravely.  \"Too late now.  You ain't good enough.\"    A few minutes silence ensued, while each member of the company  thought the matter over in his own way.  Then Mosey returned.    \"Grass up over yer boots, an' the carrion goin' into it lemons,\" he remarked.  \"I do like to give this Runnymede the benefit o' the act.  'On't ole Martin be ropeable when he sees that fence!  Magomery's as hard  as nails, his own self; but he ain't the class o' feller that watches  from behine a tree--keeps curs like Martin to do his dirty work.  But he'd like to nip every divil of us if he got half a slant.  I notice,  the more swellisher a man is, the more miserabler he is about a bite o' grass  for a team, or a feed for a traveller.  Magomery's got an edge on you,  Thompson--you an' Cunningham--for workin' on Nosey Alf's horse-paddick,  an' for leavin' some gates open.  Moriarty, the storekeeper,  he told me about it.\"    \"Well, we did n't work on Alf's horse-paddock, and we did n't leave  any gates open,\" replied Thompson.  \"We lost the steers from the ram-paddock,  here, and we found them away in the Sedan paddock.  Certainly, we camped them  all night in the Connelly paddock, but we never touched Alf's grass,  and we left no gates open.\"    \"Chorus, boys!\"  said Mosey flippantly.    \"O, what a (adj.) lie!\" echoed Dixon, Bum, and the precentor himself.  Thompson sighed; Cooper growled; and Willoughby coughed deprecatingly.    \"I don't blame ole Martin to have a bit of a nose on me,\" continued Mosey  laughingly.  \"Lord! didn't I git the loan of him cheap las' summer!  Me an' the ole man was comin' down from Karowra with the last o' the clip;  an' these paddicks was as bare as the palm o' your hand; so we goes on  past here, an' camps half-ways between the fur corner o' the ram-paddick  an' the station gate; an' looses out about an hour after sundown.  It was sort o' cloudy moonlight that night; an' I takes the carrion  straight on, an' shoves 'em in the horse-paddick, an' shuts the gate.  Then I fetches 'em into a sort of a holler, where the best grass was,  an' I takes the saddle an' bridle off o' the horse, an' lays down,  an' watches the carrion wirin' in.  Well, you know, ole Martin,  the head boundary man, he's about as nice a varmin as Warrigal Alf;  an' the young fellers at the barracks they 'on't corroborate with him,  no road; an' he thinks his self a cut above the hut, so he lives  with Daddy Montague, in Latham's ole place, down at the fur corner  o' the horse-paddick.  Well, this ole beggar he's buckin' up to Miss King,  the governess, an' Moriarty, the storekeeper, he's buckin' up to her too\"----    \"Clever feller, that Moriarty,\" interposed Price, in pathetic sycophancy.  \"Rummest young (fellow) goin', when he likes to come out.  Ain't he,  Mosey?\"  He paused and laughed heartily.  \"Las' time I unloaded  at Runnymede--an' it was on'y one ton lebm; for we was goin' out emp'y  for wool, on account o' them two Vic. chaps snappin' our loads.  I disremember if I tole you the yarn when I pulled you at the Willandra.  Anyhow it was raining like (incongruous comparison) when I drawed up  at the store; an' Moriarty he fetches me inter the office, an' gives me  a stiffener o' brandy.  Or whisky?  Now, (hair-raising imprecation)  if I don't disremember which.  But I think it was brandy.  Yes, it was brandy.\"    \"Well?\" interrogated Mosey, after a pause.    \"On'y jist showin' how one idear sort o' fetches up another,\"  replied the old man, with simulated ease of manner.    \"Well, you are a (adj.) fool.  But as I was telling you chaps:  About eleven o'clock, who should come dodgin' down the paddick but ole Martin.  Bin pokin' roun' after Miss King, I s'pose.  He walks right bang  through the carrion, thinkin' they was the station bullicks; an' me  layin' there, laughin' in to myself.  By-'n'-by he stops an' consithers,  an' then he goes roun' examinin' them, an' smellin' about, an' then  he has a long squint at Valiparaiser; an' in the heel o' the hunt he rounds up  the lot, an' sails off to the yard with 'em; an' me follerin'  ready to collar 'em when the coast was clear.  By-'n'-by I sees him leavin'  the yard, an' I goes to it, an' lo an' behold you! there was a padlock  on the gate as big as a sardine-box.\"    \" Well, we had a bunch o' keys at the camp.  I had snavelled 'em  at the railway station, las' time we was at Deniliquin, thinkin' they might  come in useful.  So I heads for the camp at the rate o' knots.  Collars the keys, an' gits a drink o' tea, an' takes a bit o' brownie  in my fist, an' back I goes, doin' the trip in about an hour.  Providential,  one o' the keys fits the lock, so I whips out the carrion, an' shoves 'em  down to where the ole sinner took 'em from.  Well, there was two station teams  in the paddick--I s'pose they wanted 'em very early for somethin'--  so I saddles Valiparaiser an' scoots across to where I seen these bullicks  when I was goin' for the keys; an' I shoves 'em into the yard;  an' I rakes up a ole grey horse, lame o' four legs, an' shoves him in along  o' the carrion, an' locks the gate, an' goes back to our lot,  an' keeps an eye on 'em till they laid down, fit to bust.  Lord! how I laughed  that night! I seen Martin watchin us nex' mornin', after we started.  He's got a set on me for that, among other things.\"    \"Hasn't Warrigal Alf got a set on you too?\" asked Thompson coldly.  \"Strikes me, you're not the safest man in the world to travel with.\"    \"Yes, Alf gives me the prayers o' the Church now an' agen,\" replied Mosey  complacently.  \"It was this way:  The winter afore last, we got a leader  in a swap at Deniliquin.  Same time I made the keys.  Yaller,  hoop-horned bullick--I dunno if you seen him with us?  Well, this Pilot,  you could n't pack him\"--Here Cooper slowly rose, and walked across  to his wagon--\"Lazy mountain o' mullick, that.\"    \"Burden to his own self,\" assented Price obsequiously.    \"Thick-headed galoot, appearingly,\" suggested Bum.    \"Ought to be hunted back to the Sydney side,\" contributed Dixon.    ----\"You could n't pack him for a near side leader,\" resumed Mosey;  \"but there was nothin' for it but shepherd all night.  You might bet yer soul  agen five bob, Pilot was off.  Whenever he seen a fence, he'd go through it,  an' whenever he seen a river, he'd swim it; an' the whole fraternity  stringin' after, thinkin' he was on for somethin' worth while.  Grand leader,  but a beggar to clear.  Well, las' year, when we went up emp'y to Bargoona--  same trip the ole man got that wonderful drink off Moriarty--who should we fine  there but this Alf, waitin' for wool, an' due for the fust load.  No fear o' him goin' up emp'y nyther.  He'd manage to collar six ton\"----    \"Don't mention that name if you can help it, Mosey,\" interrupted Cooper,  as he returned to the group, carrying a blanket and the little bag  of dead grass which he used as a pillow.  \"I'm a good-tempered man,\"  he continued, in sullen apology; \"but it gives me the wilds  and the melancholies, does that name.\"    \"Which?--Bargoona?\"    \"No; the other name.  You've got Nosey Alf, an' Warrigal Alf, an' (sheol) knows  how many other Alfs.  I got reason to hate that name.\"    \"Well,\" resumed Mosey, after a pause, \"as I was tellin' you, this cove  he was there; an' it so happened his near side leader had got bit with a snake,  an' died; an' as luck would have it, he'd sold the pick of his bullicks  to a tank-sinker, an' bought steers in theyre place; an' he had n't  another bullick fit to shove in the near side lead to tackle sich a road  as he'd got in front of him.  Well, this cove he makes fistfuls o' money,  but he's always dog-poor, so he\"----    \"Which cove makes fistfuls o' money?\" demanded Price, roused from a reverie  by the magic dissyllable.    \"Fine out, you (adj.) ole fool.  So he was flyblowed as usual  in regard o' cash; an' he was badly in want of a near side leader;  an' I kep' showin' off this Pilot, shifting wagons from the door o' the shed,  an' tinkerin' about; an' he offered us two good bullicks for the counterfit;  an' me an' the ole man we hum'd and ha'd, an' let on we did n't want  to part with him; an' me as thin as a whippin'-post with watchin'  the yaller-hided dodger every night, to keep him from goin' overland  to the bounds o' creation.  Well, at long an' at last we swapped level  for Valiparaiser.  I seen the workin' o' Providence in it from fust to last.  The horse he's worth twenty notes, all out; an' Pilot he was dear at a gift.  I say, Tom; that's a grand horse you got off o' the Far-downer.  Goes like a greyhound.  Gosh, you had that bloke to rights.  He's whippin' the cat now like fury.  I was chiackin' him about the deal,  when he told me you swapped level; an' he wanted to change the subject.  'I'm frightened you'll be short o' grass to-night,' says he.  'Where you goin' to camp?' says he.  The (adj.) fool!\"    \"What did you tell him?\" asked Thompson.    \"Ram-paddick, of course.  You don't ketch me tellin' the truth  about where I'm goin' to camp.  But you got a rakin' horse, Tom;  an' I give you credit for gittin' at the blind side o' the turf-cutter.\"    \"He'll do me well enough for poking about,\" I replied modestly.  \"But how did the other fellow get on with Pilot?\"    \"It was the fun o' the world,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#5)"],[1,"deeply  interested in the welfare of the Lutheran Church, judiciously and  vigorously sustained his new court-preacher in all his labors. The latter,  in addition to his ordinary pastoral duties, visited the congregations of  the whole territory, introduced various ecclesiastical reforms, and  continued till his death, which occurred May 11, 1621, to enjoy the divine  blessing himself, and to be a blessing to all whom his influence reached.  If he was born during a stormy period, and lived in an age of  controversies which wounded his soul, he was, nevertheless, like Luther,  very happy in being permitted to terminate his labors precisely at the  time when he was called away. For, as Luther closed his eyes in peace  during the year which preceded the disastrous battle of Muehlberg (April  24, 1547), so Arndt fell asleep soon after the Thirty Years' War began,  before the world saw those horrors which language fails to describe in  their awful extent. He had contracted a disease of the throat, which was  subsequently aggravated by a violent fever; and his exhausted frame at  length yielded to the assault of disease. He sent for his friend and  brother, the Rev. William Storch, early in the morning of May 9. After  being placed on a chair, he humbly made a general confession of his sins,  declared once more that he adhered as heretofore to the pure doctrine of  God's word and rejected every error, and then, with all the cheerfulness  of Christian faith, received the Lord's Supper. Dr. Morris, in the work  referred to, in a note above, quotes from his authorities the following:  \"Mr. Storch then addressed him (in language similar to that which Dr.  Jonas used in speaking to the dying Luther) as follows: 'I do not doubt,  that as you have never entertained any doctrine contrary to God's word,  but have always continued firm and steadfast in the pure, unadulterated  word, the Scriptures of the prophets and apostles, the Augsburg  Confession, and other Symbolical Books of the Lutheran Church, and most  heartily and sincerely despised and rejected all contrary doctrines, so  you will also by God's grace maintain to the end the same doctrines and  faith which you have publicly preached and professed.' Arndt replied  several times, in a weak but intelligible voice, most decisively, 'Yes,  yes, that I will, even to the end.' \" On the 11th of May he began to sink  rapidly, but was still able to repeat many of his favorite texts, such as  Ps. 143:2, and John 5:24. After having slept a short time, he awoke,  looked upward, and exclaimed with a comparatively loud voice: \"We beheld  his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace  and truth.\" John 1:14. His wife asked him when he had seen that \"glory.\"  He replied: \"I saw it just now. O what a glory it is! It is the glory  which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the  heart of man to conceive of. This is the glory which I saw.\"--When he heard  the clock striking at eight in the evening, he asked what the hour was.  When it struck again, he repeated the question. On being told that it was  striking nine, he said: \"Now I have overcome all.\" These were the last  words of this \"good soldier of Jesus Christ.\" 2 Tim. 2:3. He lay perfectly  still until after midnight, when he breathed his last. God had given him a  peaceful death. The serenity of his soul in his last hours seemed to  linger on his features, even after the spirit had departed.    § 23. Two dukes of Brunswick-Lueneburg followed him to the grave (May  15th), as a testimony of their sense of the great worth of their revered  spiritual guide. The text of the funeral sermon, delivered by Rev. Mr.  Storch, consisted of the words, \"I have fought a good fight,\" etc. 2 Tim.  4:7, 8. His remains were deposited in the church at Celle. The tomb  exhibits the following inscription:          Qui Jesum vidit, qui mundum et daemona vicit,          Arndius in scriptis vivit ovatque suis.      (That is: _Arndt, who saw Jesus, and conquered the world and the devil,  lives and triumphs in his writings_.)    § 24. Nothing could be more unjust than any charge affecting the purity of  the faith of Arndt as a Lutheran Christian. His general orthodoxy was  always readily admitted; a few unreasonable and prejudiced men, however,  who suspected that mysticism and other errors were concealed in the \"True  Christianity,\" although the existence of such matter could not be  established, nevertheless alleged, with a certain morbid feeling, that  Arndt did not adopt the entire creed of the Lutheran Church, as set forth  in \"all her symbolical books.\" This circumstance accounts for the  frequency and earnestness with which he declares his _unconditional_  acceptance of, and hearty belief in, _all_ the details of the Lutheran  faith. Thus the reader will find, at the close of the Preface to Book I.,  an emphatic declaration of his recognition of the doctrines of _all the  Symbolical Books_, the names of which he enumerates in full. See, also,  the conclusion of Book II., and the conclusion of the Preface to Book IV.,  where similar declarations occur. He repeats them in his Preface to Book  VI., where he employs the following language: \"My dear reader, inasmuch as  our holy Christian faith, the pure evangelical doctrine, has, for about  one hundred years, been elucidated, purified, and sufficiently explained,  in accordance with the rule of the holy Word of God, and also been  cleansed from many errors through the means of two glorious and  praiseworthy confessions of faith, namely, the Augsburg Confession, and  the Formula of Concord, which have hitherto been, and still continue to  be, my own confession of faith; and, inasmuch as some have, at the same  time, uttered complaints respecting the ungodly manner of life of the  present world, with which the Christian faith cannot coexist; therefore, I  wrote, some years ago, Four Books on TRUE CHRISTIANITY, in which I have  depicted the internal, and, also, the external Christian life. For  although the pure _doctrine is the foremost point of true Christianity_, I  have, nevertheless, not wished to treat of it in a special manner, as this  has been copiously and superabundantly done by others, and is still daily  done; and I have taken only the Christian _life_ as my subject.\" This Book  VI. appeared somewhat less than a year before his death, and gives special  prominence to the last of the Lutheran confessions of faith--the FORMULA OF  CONCORD--in which the doctrines concerning the Person of Christ, the Lord's  Supper, etc., are set forth in all their details; he thus repeats anew his  cordial acceptance of the doctrines contained therein. In a letter of  thanks addressed to Dr. Mentzer, of Giessen (Book VI., Part II., Letter  7), he expressly rejects the serious doctrinal errors of Schwenkfeldt  respecting the Scriptures, the Person of Christ, the two Sacraments, etc.,  and adds: \"These errors have been publicly condemned and rejected, partly  in the Augsburg Confession, and partly in the Formula of Concord, after  the pure doctrine was firmly established.\" He concurs, of course, in the  condemnation of such errors.--In Letter 8, of the same Book, addressed to  Dr. Piscator, of Jena, he says: \"I call on the great God, the Searcher of  hearts, as my witness, that it was not in my mind, in anything which I  have written, to depart from the true religion of the Augsburg Confession  and the Formula of Concord, and that I had no intention to disseminate  erroneous opinions, much less to defend any which conflicted with the  Symbolical Books of our Church.\"    § 25. On his death-bed he repeated anew, as we have seen, that he  continued, as heretofore, to adhere faithfully to the pure evangelical  doctrine. In the two copies of his last will and testament, of the years  1610 and 1616, he solemnly declares that he had always held with full  consciousness and understanding the doctrines of the Augsburg Confession  and the Formula of Concord, and never departed from their contents either  in his public teaching or his private views, that he never would adopt any  other faith, and that he prayed that the grace of God might sustain him in  this frame of mind until his last hour should come. The singularly  emphatic manner in which, on every appropriate occasion--and many of such  occurred--he declared his sincere belief in the peculiar and distinctive  doctrines of the Lutheran Church, in all their details, as set forth in  her SYMBOLICAL BOOKS, by no means proceeded from a narrow-minded sectarian  feeling. \"Christ is all, and in all\" (Col. 3:11)--these apostolic words  indicate the spirit of Arndt's religion. He could not sympathize with the  Papist, who robs Christ of the glory which belongs exclusively to his  atoning work--not with the Unitarian, who attempts to dethrone Him--not with  the fanatic, who, even when honest, is misguided by passion and spiritual  pride--not with the unbeliever, who flees from the shame of the cross--not  even with his Reformed fellow-Christians, whose merits he readily  acknowledged, but whose rejection of the Lutheran doctrine respecting the  Person of Christ and the Lord's Supper, as set forth especially in the  Formula of Concord, grieved his soul. He had found the precious Gospel  truth, which constituted his life, to be identical with the creed of his  Church, and with _that_ creed alone, in all its glorious fulness. He could  not consent to sacrifice one jot or one tittle of the Augsburg Confession,  nor could he assign to it an isolated position, even though Zwingli and  his associates readily adopted it, with the single exception of Article X.  Nor did his heart or his conscience allow him to ignore the other Lutheran  Symbols. The _Augsburg Confession_ undoubtedly contained the pure truth of  the Gospel, without any admixture of errors; but, owing to the  circumstances and the times in which it originated, when it"]]]
