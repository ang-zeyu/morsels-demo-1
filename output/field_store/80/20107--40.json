The more nearly equal a country's income  distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and  the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index  of 25. The more unequal a country's income distribution, the farther  its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini  index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of 50. If income  were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would  coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if  income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve  would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis  and the index would be 100.    E      Economy    This category includes the entries dealing with the size,  development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,  labor, and capital.    Economy - overview    This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the  degree of market orientation, the level of economic development, the  most important natural resources, and the unique areas of  specialization.

The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout  the entry:  Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater  fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions  (see acid rain).  Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially  deadly to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using  the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are  considered alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid  precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been  measured in rainfall in New England.  Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,  smoke, or fog.  Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas  that have been cut or destroyed by fire.  Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used  in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic  in particulate form.  Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced  disruption.  Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,  abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.  Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given  area or volume.  Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.  Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with  limited freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.  DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT  was banned in the US in 1972.  Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.  Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land  clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as  fuel) without planting new growth.  Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or  semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally  productive soils, or climate change.  Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms  (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant  destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.  Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is  generally anchored to a boat and left to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35830"],[0,"The 2010 CIA World Factbook (#5)"],[1,"runways      This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways  (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces) by length. For airports with  more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according  to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m (over 10,000 ft),  (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m (8,000 to 10,000 ft), (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m  (5,000 to 8,000 ft), (4) 914 to 1,523 m (3,000 to 5,000 ft), and (5)  under 914 m (under 3,000 ft). Only airports with usable runways are  included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for  refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control. The type aircraft  capable of operating from a runway of a given length is dependent  upon a number of factors including elevation of the runway, runway  gradient, average maximum daily temperature at the airport, engine  types, flap settings, and take-off weight of the aircraft.    Appendixes      This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.        Area      This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all  land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the  surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or  rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.        Area - comparative      This entry provides an area comparison based on total area  equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of  the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by  the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are compared with  Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC  (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).        B          Background      This entry usually highlights major historic events and current  issues and may include a statement about one or two key future  trends.        Birth rate      This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year  per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude  birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in  determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the  level of fertility and the age structure of the population.        Broadcast media      This entry provides information on the approximate number of public  and private TV and radio stations in a country, as well as basic  information on the availability of satellite and cable TV services.        Budget      This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital  expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate  basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.        C          Capital      This entry gives the name of the seat of government, its geographic  coordinates, the time difference relative to Coordinated Universal  Time (UTC) and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if  applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where  appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those  countries that have multiple time zones.        Central bank discount rate      This entry provides the annualized interest rate a country's central  bank charges commercial, depository banks for loans to meet  temporary shortages of funds.        Climate      This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes  throughout the year.        Coastline      This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land  area (including islands) and the sea.        Commercial bank prime lending rate      This entry provides a simple average of annualized interest rates  commercial banks charge on new loans, denominated in the national  currency, to their most credit-worthy customers.    Communications      This category deals with the means of exchanging information and  includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet host entries.        Communications - note      This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of  significance not included elsewhere.        Constitution      This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major  amendments.    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)      UTC is the international atomic time scale that serves as the basis  of timekeeping for most of the world. The hours, minutes, and  seconds expressed by UTC represent the time of day at the Prime  Meridian (0 deg. longitude) located near Greenwich, England as reckoned  from midnight. UTC is calculated by the Bureau International des  Poids et Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. The BIPM averages data  collected from more than 200 atomic time and frequency standards  located at about 50 laboratories worldwide. UTC is the basis for all  civil time with the Earth divided into time zones expressed as  positive or negative differences from UTC. UTC is also referred to  as \"Zulu time.\" See the Standard Time Zones of the World map  included with the Reference Maps.    Country data codes      See Data codes.    Country map      Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The  maps were produced from the best information available at the time  of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed  subsequently.        Country name      This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the  US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example):  conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form  (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form  (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation.  Also see the Terminology note.    Crude oil      See entry for oil.        Current account balance      This entry records a country's net trade in goods and services, plus  net earnings from rents, interest, profits, and dividends, and net  transfer payments (such as pension funds and worker remittances) to  and from the rest of the world during the period specified. These  figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in  purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.        D      Data codes      This information is presented in This information is presented in <a  href = \"../appendix/appendix-d.html\"Appendix D: Cross-Reference List  of Country Data Codes and and <a href =  \"../appendix/appendix-e.html\" Appendix E: Cross-Reference List of  Hydrographic Data Codes.    Date of information      In general, information available as of January in a given year is  used in the preparation of the printed edition.    Daylight Saving Time (DST)      This entry is included for those entities that have adopted a policy  of adjusting the official local time forward, usually one hour, from  Standard Time during summer months. Such policies are most common in  mid-latitude regions.        Death rate      This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year  per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The  death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation  in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age  distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the  overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at  all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.        Debt - external      This entry gives the total public and private debt owed to  nonresidents repayable in internationally accepted currencies,  goods, or services. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate  basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.        Dependency status      This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular  nonindependent entity and an independent state.        Dependent areas      This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent  entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation      The US Government has diplomatic relations with 189 independent  states, including 187 of the 192 UN members (excluded UN members are  Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition,  the US has diplomatic relations with 2 independent states that are  not in the UN, the Holy See and Kosovo, as well as with the EU.        Diplomatic representation from the US      This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.        Diplomatic representation in the US      This entry includes the chief of mission, chancery, telephone, FAX,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.        Disputes - international      This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US  Department of State. References to other situations involving  borders or frontiers may also be included, such as resource  disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however,  inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or  recognition by the US Government.        Distribution of family income - Gini index      This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of  family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz  curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the  number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The  index is the ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve  and the 45 degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area  under the 45 degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income  distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to the 45"]]]
