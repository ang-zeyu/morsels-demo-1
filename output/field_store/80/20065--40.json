Usually, however, the difficulty may be overcome without  special apparatus. It is, in fact, only necessary to carry out the  instructions given below to obtain a considerable brush flame rich in  air, in which the lead glass can be worked, not only without  discoloration, but with the greatest facility.    [4] See _Principles of Glass-making_, p. 31.    _To Produce an Oxidising Brush Flame._--The blower used must be  powerful, the air-tube of the blow-pipe must be about half as great in  diameter as the outer tube which supplies the gas. The operator must  work his bellows so as to supply a strong and _steady_ blast of air, and  the supply of gas must be regulated so that the brush flame produced is  free from every sign of incomplete combustion,[5] which may be known by  its outer zone being only faintly visible in daylight, and quite free  from luminous streaks (see Fig. 4, p. 9). When a suitable flame has been  produced, try it by rotating a piece of lead glass at or near the end of  the inner blue part of the flame (_A_ Fig. 4); the appearance of the  glass will quickly indicate reduction. When this occurs move the glass  forward to the end of the outer zone _B_, but keep it sufficiently  within the flame to maintain it at a high temperature. If all is right  the metallic reduction will quickly disappear, the glass will become  perfectly transparent once more, and will present the appearance  previously observed in the experiments with the pointed flame, or, if  very hot, assume a brownish-red appearance. If this does not occur, the  supply of air must be increased or the supply of gas diminished until  the proper effects are secured.    [5] Nevertheless the supply of air must not be so excessive as to reduce  the temperature of the flame sufficiently to prevent the thorough  softening of the glass, which will occur if the bellows is worked with  too much zeal.    In working upon lead glass with the highly oxidising brush flame, it is  a good plan to heat it in the reducing part of the flame _A_ for  thoroughly softening the glass, and to remove it to the oxidising flame  _B_ to burn away the reduced metal. In prolonged operations, in order  that reduction may never go too far, hold the glass alternately in the  hot reducing flame and in the oxidising flame. The inferiority of the  outer oxidising flame to those portions nearer the inner blue zone for  softening the glass, may perhaps be accounted for by the presence of a  larger proportion of unconsumed air in the former, which being heated at  the expense of the hot gases produced by combustion, thereby lowers the  temperature of the flame. At or near _A_ (Fig. 4) where the combustion  is nearly complete, but no excess of air exists, the temperature will  naturally be highest.    If a very large tube be rotated in the oxidising flame at _B_ (Fig. 4)  it may happen that the flame is not large enough to surround the tube,  and that as it is rotated those parts of it which are most remote from  the flame will cool down too considerably to allow all parts of the tube  to be simultaneously brought into the desired condition. This difficulty  may be overcome by placing two blow-pipes exactly opposite to each  other, at such a distance that there is an interval of about an inch  between the extremities of their flames, and rotating the tube between  the two flames. It may be necessary to provide two blowers for the  blow-pipes if they are large.    Again, if a very narrow zone of a tube of moderate size is to be heated,  two pointed flames may be similarly arranged with advantage.  Occasionally more than two flames are made to converge upon one tube in  this manner.    Another method of preventing one side of a tube from cooling down whilst  the other is presented to the flame, is to place a brick at a short  distance from the extremity of the flame. The brick checks the loss of  heat considerably. A block of beech wood may be used for the same  purpose, the wood ignites and thereby itself becomes a source of heat,  and is even more effective than a brick.    Fuller details of the management of lead glass under various  circumstances will be found in the subsequent descriptions of operations  before the blow-pipe.    Before proceeding to work with soda glass, the student should not only  verify by experiments what has been already said, but he should  familiarise himself with the action of the blow-pipe flame on lead glass  by trying the glass in every part of the flame, varying the proportions  of gas and air in every way, repeating, and repeating, his experiments  until he can obtain any desired effect with certainty and promptitude.  He should practice some of the simpler operations given in Chapter III.  in order to impress what he has learned well on his mind.      =Management of Soda Glass.=--In working with soda glass the following  points must be constantly kept in mind. That as it is much more apt than  lead glass to crack when suddenly heated, great caution must be  exercised in bringing it into the flame; and that in making large joints  or in making two joints near each other, all parts of the tube adjacent  to that which, for the moment, is being heated, must be kept hot, as it  is very apt to crack when adjacent parts are unequally heated. This may  be effected by stopping work at short intervals and warming the cooler  parts of the tube, or by the use of the brick or block of wood to check  radiation, or even by placing a supplementary blow-pipe or Bunsen burner  in such a position that its flame plays upon the more distant parts of  the work, not coming sufficiently into contact to soften the glass,  however, but near enough to keep it well heated. Lastly, to prevent the  finished work from falling to pieces after or during cooling, the  directions given under the head of annealing must be carefully carried  out.    In very much of his work the glass-blower is guided more by the _feel_  of the glass than by what he sees. The power of feeling glass can only  be acquired by practice, and after a certain amount of preliminary  failure. As a rule I have observed that beginners are apt to raise their  glass to a higher temperature than is necessary, and that they employ  larger flames than are wanted. If glass be made too soft it may fall so  completely out of shape as to become unworkable except in very skilful  hands. The following rules, therefore, should be strictly adhered to.  Always employ in the first instance the smallest flame that is likely to  do the work required. In operations involving _blowing out_ viscous  glass, attempt to blow the glass at low temperatures before higher ones  are tried. After a little experience the adoption of the right-sized  flame for a given purpose, and the perception of the best condition of  glass for blowing it, become almost automatic.    I may add that glass which is to be bent needs to be much less heated  than glass which is to be blown.      =Annealing.=--If apparatus, the glass of which is very thin and of  uniform substance, be heated, on removal from the source of heat it will  cool equally throughout, and therefore may often be heated and cooled  without any special precautions. If the glass be thick, and especially  if it be of unequal thickness in various parts, the thinner portions  will cool more quickly than those which are more massive; this will  result in the production of tension between the thicker and thinner  parts in consequence of inequality in the rates of contraction, and  fractures will occur either spontaneously or upon any sudden shock.  Thus, if a hot tube be touched with cold or wet iron, or slightly  scratched with a cold file, the inequality of the rate of cooling is  great, and it breaks at once. It is therefore necessary to secure that  hot glass shall cool as regularly as possible. And this is particularly  important in the case of articles made of soda glass. Some glass-blowers  content themselves with permitting the glass to cool gradually in a  smoky flame till it is covered with carbon, and then leave it to cool  upon the table. But under this treatment many joints made of soda glass  which are not quite uniform in substance, but otherwise serviceable,  will break down. In glass-works the annealing is done in ovens so  arranged that the glass enters at the hottest end of the oven where it  is uniformly heated to a temperature not much below that at which it  becomes viscous, and slowly passed through the cooler parts of the  chamber so that it emerges cold at the other end. This method of  annealing is not practicable in a small laboratory. But fortunately very  good results can be obtained by the following simple device, viz.:--    By wrapping the hot apparatus that is to be annealed closely in cotton  wool, and leaving it there till quite cold. The glass should be wrapped  up immediately after it is blown into its final shape, as soon as it is  no longer soft enough to give way under slight pressure. And it should  be heated as uniformly as possible, not only at the joint, but also  about the parts adjacent to the joint, at the moment of surrounding it  with the cotton. Lead glass appears to cool more regularly than soda  glass, and these precautions may be more safely neglected with apparatus  made of lead glass; but not always. At the date of writing I have had  several well-blown joints of thick-walled capillary tube to No. 16 (see  diagram, p. 82), break during cooling, in consequence of circumstances  making it dangerous to heat the neighbourhood of the joint so much as  was necessary.    The black carbonaceous coat formed on hot glass when it is placed in  cotton wool may be removed by wiping with methylated spirit, or, if it  be very closely adherent, by gently rubbing with fine emery, moistened  with the spirit.    Cotton wool is rather dangerously inflammable; it should therefore be  kept out of reach of the blow-pipe flame, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#5)"],[1," happy man. Seven successive  generations of reputable ancestry connect him with the Rev. John Mayo, a  divine of distinguished piety and learning who in the year 1630 came to  this country, and after settling in the town of Barnstable, transferred  his residence to Boston, and became the first pastor of the South  Church. The English pedigree of this John Mayo is one of the oldest  among the gentry of Great Britain. On his mother's side Dr. Mayo also  traces his descent for several ages through the Starbucks, one of the  primitive families of that most primitive of all places, the island of  Nantucket.    The parents of Dr. Mayo removed to the village of Ogdensburg on the St.  Lawrence under the circumstances very similar to those described in  Kaloolah, and he was there born in the year 1812. His early intellectual  training was under the pedagogueism of the Rev. Josiah Perry, one of the  few men formed by nature for school-masters, who has left as marked a  memory in a smaller sphere as did ever Parr or Burke in theirs. Never  was instruction better given in all the elements of a thorough English  education than for many years in his well-known school, which has  produced several of the most distinguished men of the present time. From  this the subject of our memoir was transferred, at the age of eleven or  twelve, for the purpose of pursuing classical studies, to the academy at  Potsdam, which enjoyed for a number of years the superintendence in the  office of its principals of a succession of very eminent men, among them  the present Rt. Rev. Bishop of North Carolina. His successor, under whom  Dr. Mayo's pupilage occurred, was the Rev. Mr. Banks, a Presbyterian  divine from New England, of learning, taste, and refinement, such as  were rarely met with even in that day among men of his class.    The description of the early life of Jonathan Romer is in the main the  history of the author himself. At the age of seventeen he commenced the  study of medicine, which he pursued with ardor and success. In 1832,  having attended for three years the lectures of the College of  Physicians and Surgeons in this city, he underwent his examination for a  degree, but did not receive a diploma till the ensuing term, not having  attained the legal age of twenty-one. After spending several years in  the city hospitals and in private practice, he abandoned brilliant  professional prospects to go abroad, partly for the benefit of his  health and partly urged by the spirit of adventure, which had long led  him to form plans for the exploration of Central Africa. Perhaps it is  to be regretted that he was prevented by the infirmity of  short-sightedness from emulating the achievements of Park, Clapperton  and Ledyard, for which his moral and physical constitution eminently  fitted him. He travelled extensively in Spain and Barbary however, and  we have the results in Kaloolah and in The Berber.    Anonymously, in various magazines, Dr. Mayo had written much and well,  but he was scarcely known as an author until the appearance of the work  upon which his fame still chiefly rests, _Kaloolah, or Journeyings to  the Djebel Kumri_, in the spring of 1849. It has frequently been said  that Kaloolah was suggested by the popular works of Herman Melville, but  it was written and nearly printed before the appearance of Typee, the  first of Mr. Melville's productions; and we see no reason for another  opinion, that it was an offspring of the author's love for Defoe; if it  was not an altogether spontaneous and independent work, its parentage  was probably less famous; we know of no composition so nearly resembling  Kaloolah as the pretended _Narrative of Robert Adams, an American sailor  who was wrecked on the Western Coast of Africa, in the year 1810,  detained three years in slavery by the Arabs, and afterward several  months a resident in the city of Timbuctoo_. This was a piece of pure  fiction, though brought out in London in a splendid quarto under the  endorsement of the Lord Chancellor, the President of the Royal Society,  and many other eminent persons in literature, science, and affairs, and  elaborately and credulously reviewed in the Edinburgh, the Quarterly,  and other Reviews. The hero of this performance, after various  adventures, was married to a dusky princess in the _terra incognita_,  and made almost as many marvellous discoveries as are recorded by  Jonathan Romer. Another and a very different writer, who selected  central Africa to be the field of somewhat similar inventions, was the  learned and ingenious Richard Adams Locke, whose astonishing history of  revelations in the moon was not more creditable to his abilities than  his singularly recovered MSS. of a lost traveller by the borders of the  Niger and in middle Africa, published in the _New Era_ journal in this  city about the year 1838. But we do not suppose Dr. Mayo was indebted to  either of these works for the idea of his story. And just as erroneous  as the charge of plagiarism, and much more absurd, is the notion that he  designed Kaloolah as a \"satirical criticism on life and manners in  New-York.\" A writer in the _North British Review_ declares that he  \"could not help laughing aloud,\" though seated quietly by himself, at  the \"description of a musical entertainment of the court of the hero's  royal father-in-law, heaven knows where in Africa, and intended as a  burlesque on the sheer noise which is the predominant element\" in all  our orchestras. We assure the shrewd critic most positively that the  author never dreamed of such a thing. Kaloolah is too well known to need  much description; its success was certain and immediate, and not many  original works have ever been published in this country which have had a  larger circulation. It evinces remarkable fertility of invention, is  exceedingly interesting, and abounds in clearly defined, spirited, and  occasionally well finished portraitures. Kaloolah, the heroine, is a  fresh and beautiful creation, worthy of any of the masters of fiction.  The hero, Romer, is designed merely as a type of the determined Yankee  adventurer, drawn with only the exaggeration demanded in works of art;  and half the seeming of extravagance in the narrative and the sketches  of nature would have disappeared if the author had not, to reduce his  volume to the size deemed by his publisher most promising of profit,  omitted all his numerous and curious notes.    Kaloolah was followed in 1850 by _The Berber, or the Mountaineer of the  Atlas_, a story of Spain and Morocco, about the close of the seventeenth  century. As a novel it is decidedly better than Kaloolah; it displays  greater skill in narration, and is written in the same pure, distinct  and nervous English. Dr. Mayo thoroughly understood from observation as  well as study all the accessories of his subject, and we are mistaken if  any recent book on northern Africa gives a more clear, spirited or just  impression of its scenery or of the character and manners of its people.  The hero is of the highest style of the half-barbarian chiefs of the  country and time; born a Christian, educated a Mohamedan, and ambitious  to free his tribe from the domination of the Moors, and to found a new  empire, with a higher civilization than was ever known to the race he  leads; and other characters have enough adventures, dimly sketched, to  fill the circles of a dozen tragedies if brought more near the eye. The  faults of the book are, an excess of incident, discursiveness preventing  proper unity and proportion, and a confessed failure of the story to  evolve all the intended moralities, which the author therefore in some  cases brings forward in his own person.    The last volume we have had from the hand of Dr. Mayo is, _Romance Dust  from the Historic Placer_, a collection of shorter stories chiefly  founded on historical incidents. In these he exhibits the fresh feeling,  occasionally the humor, and always the bold drawing and effective  coloring which distinguish his more ambitious performances. The volume  contains also a poem, but not one of such striking qualities as to  induce regret that the author has commonly chosen to write in prose. The  style of his novels, especially in the narrative parts, is uncommonly  good, but with its many excellencies it does not seem to us that it  possesses a poetical element.    Dr. Mayo has commenced a brilliant course, in which we trust we shall  have occasions to record still greater triumphs than those by which he  has won a place in the first rank of the young writers of English.    The portrait at the beginning of this article is very truthful; it is  from a recent daguerreotype by Brady.
