In any case--it's over.\"    They entered the house and the Industrialist greeted his wife calmly.  \"Lunch about ready, dear.\"    \"I'm afraid not. You see--\" She looked hesitantly at the Astronomer.    \"Is anything wrong?\" asked the Industrialist. \"Why not tell me? I'm sure  our guest won't mind a little family discussion.\"    \"Pray don't pay any attention whatever to me,\" muttered the Astronomer.  He moved miserably to the other end of the living room.    The woman said, in low, hurried tones, \"Really, dear, cook's that upset.  I've been soothing her for hours and honestly, I don't know why Red  should have done it.\"    \"Done what?\" The Industrialist was more amused than otherwise. It had  taken the united efforts of himself and his son months to argue his wife  into using the name \"Red\" rather than the perfectly ridiculous (viewed  youngster fashion) name which was his real one.    She said, \"He's taken most of the chopped meat.\"    \"He's eaten it?\"    \"Well, I hope not. It was raw.\"    \"Then what would he want it for?\"    \"I haven't the slightest idea. I haven't seen him since breakfast.  Meanwhile cook's just furious. She caught him vanishing out the kitchen  door and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she was  going to use it for lunch. Well, you know cook. She had to change the  lunch menu and that means she won't be worth living with for a week.  You'll just have to speak to Red, dear, and make him promise not to do  things in the kitchen any more. And it wouldn't hurt to have him  apologize to cook.\"    \"Oh, come. She works for us. If we don't complain about a change in  lunch menu, why should she?\"    \"Because she's the one who has double-work made for her, and she's  talking about quitting. Good cooks aren't easy to get. Do you remember  the one before her?\"    It was a strong argument.    The Industrialist looked about vaguely. He said, \"I suppose you're  right. He isn't here, I suppose. When he comes in, I'll talk to him.\"    \"You'd better start. Here he comes.\"    Red walked into the house and said cheerfully, \"Time for lunch, I  guess.\" He looked from one parent to the other in quick speculation at  their fixed stares and said, \"Got to clean up first, though,\" and made  for the other door.    The Industrialist said, \"One moment, son.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Where's your little friend?\"    Red said, carelessly, \"He's around somewhere. We were just sort of  walking and I looked around and he wasn't there.\" This was perfectly  true, and Red felt on safe ground. \"I told him it was lunch time. I  said, 'I suppose it's about lunch time.' I said, 'We got to be getting  back to the house.' And he said, 'Yes.' And I just went on and then when  I was about at the creek I looked around and--\"    The Astronomer interrupted the voluble story, looking up from a  magazine he had been sightlessly rummaging through. \"I wouldn't worry  about my youngster. He is quite self-reliant. Don't wait lunch for him.\"    \"Lunch isn't ready in any case, Doctor.\" The Industrialist turned once  more to his son. \"And talking about that, son, the reason for it is that  something happened to the ingredients. Do you have anything to say?\"    \"Sir?\"    \"I hate to feel that I have to explain myself more fully. Why did you  take the chopped meat?\"    \"The chopped meat?\"    \"The chopped meat.\" He waited patiently.    Red said, \"Well, I was sort of--\"    \"Hungry?\" prompted his father. \"For raw meat?\"    \"No, sir. I just sort of needed it.\"    \"For what exactly?\"    Red looked miserable and remained silent.    The Astronomer broke in again. \"If you don't mind my putting in a few  words--You'll remember that just after breakfast my son came in to ask  what animals ate.\"    \"Oh, you're right. How stupid of me to forget. Look here, Red, did you  take it for an animal pet you've got?\"    Red recovered indignant breath. He said, \"You mean Slim came in here and  said I had an animal? He came in here and said that? He said I had an  animal?\"    \"No, he didn't. He simply asked what animals ate. That's all. Now if he  promised he wouldn't tell on you, he didn't. It's your own foolishness  in trying to take something without permission that gave you away. That  happened to be stealing. Now have you an animal? I ask you a direct  question.\"    \"Yes, sir.\" It was a whisper so low as hardly to be heard.    \"All right, you'll have to get rid of it. Do you understand?\"    Red's mother intervened. \"Do you mean to say you're keeping a  meat-eating animal, Red? It might bite you and give you blood-poison.\"    \"They're only small ones,\" quavered Red. \"They hardly budge if you touch  them.\"    \"They? How many do you have?\"    \"Two.\"    \"Where are they?\"    The Industrialist touched her arm. \"Don't chivvy the child any further,\"  he said, in a low voice. \"If he says he'll get rid of them, he will,  and that's punishment enough.\"    He dismissed the matter from his mind.      VIII    Lunch was half over when Slim dashed into the dining room. For a moment,  he stood abashed, and then he said in what was almost hysteria, \"I've  got to speak to Red. I've got to say something.\"    Red looked up in fright, but the Astronomer said, \"I don't think, son,  you're being very polite. You've kept lunch waiting.\"    \"I'm sorry, Father.\"    \"Oh, don't rate the lad,\" said the Industrialist's wife. \"He can speak  to Red if he wants to, and there was no damage done to the lunch.\"    \"I've got to speak to Red alone,\" Slim insisted.    \"Now that's enough,\" said the Astronomer with a kind of gentleness that  was obviously manufactured for the benefit of strangers and which had  beneath it an easily-recognized edge. \"Take your seat.\"    Slim did so, but he ate only when someone looked directly upon him. Even  then he was not very successful.    Red caught his eyes. He made soundless words, \"Did the animals get  loose?\"    Slim shook his head slightly. He whispered, \"No, it's--\"    The Astronomer looked at him hard and Slim faltered to a stop.    With lunch over, Red slipped out of the room, with a microscopic motion  at Slim to follow.    They walked in silence to the creek.    Then Red turned fiercely upon his companion. \"Look here, what's the idea  of telling my Dad we were feeding animals?\"    Slim said, \"I didn't. I asked what you feed animals. That's not the same  as saying we were doing it. Besides, it's something else, Red.\"    But Red had not used up his grievances. \"And where did you go anyway? I  thought you were coming to the house. They acted like it was my fault  you weren't there.\"    \"But I'm trying to tell you about that, if you'd only shut _up_ a second  and let me talk. You don't give a fellow a chance.\"    \"Well, go on and tell me if you've got so much to say.\"    \"I'm _trying_ to. I went back to the space-ship. The folks weren't there  anymore and I wanted to see what it was like.\"    \"It isn't a space-ship,\" said Red, sullenly. He had nothing to lose.    \"It is, too. I looked inside. You could look through the ports and I  looked inside and they were _dead_.\" He looked sick. \"They were dead.\"    \"_Who_ were dead.\"    Slim screeched, \"Animals! like _our_ animals! Only they _aren't_  animals. They're people-things from other planets.\"    For a moment Red might have been turned to stone. It didn't occur to him  to disbelieve Slim at this point. Slim looked too genuinely the bearer  of just such tidings. He said, finally, \"Oh, my.\"    \"Well, what are we going to do? Golly, will we get a whopping if they  find out?\" He was shivering.    \"We better turn them loose,\" said Red.    \"They'll tell on us.\"    \"They can't talk our language. Not if they're from another planet.\"    \"Yes, they can. Because I remember my father talking about some stuff  like that to my mother when he didn't know I was in the room. He was  talking about visitors who could talk with the mind. Telepathery or  something. I thought he was making it up.\"    \"Well, Holy Smokes. I mean--Holy Smokes.\" Red looked up. \"I tell you. My  Dad said to get rid of them. Let's sort of bury them somewhere or throw  them in the creek.\"    \"He _told_ you to do that.\"    \"He made me say I had animals and then he said, 'Get rid of them.' I got  to do what he says. Holy Smokes, he's my Dad.\"    Some of the panic left Slim's heart. It was a thoroughly legalistic way  out. \"Well, let's do it right now, then, before they find out. Oh,  golly, if they find out, will we be in trouble!\"    They broke into a run toward the barn, unspeakable visions in their  minds.      IX    It was different, looking at them as though they were \"people.\" As  animals, they had been interesting; as \"people,\" horrible. Their eyes,  which were neutral little objects before, now seemed to watch them with  active malevolence.    \"They're making noises,\" said Slim, in a whisper which was barely  audible.    \"I guess they're talking or something,\" said Red. Funny that those  noises which they had heard before had not had significance earlier. He  was making no move toward them. Neither was Slim.    The canvas was off but they were just watching. The ground meat, Slim  noticed, hadn't been touched.    Slim said, \"Aren't you going to do something?\"    \"Aren't you?\"    \"You found them.\"    \"It's your turn, now.\"    \"No, it isn't. You found them. It's your fault, the whole thing. I was  watching.\"    \"You joined in, Slim. You know you did.\"    \"I don't care. You found them and that's what I'll say when they come  here looking for us.\"    Red said, \"All right for you.\" But the thought of the consequences  inspired him anyway, and he reached for the cage door.    Slim said, \"Wait!\"    Red was glad to. He said, \"Now what's biting you?\"    \"One of them's got something on him that looks like it might be iron or  something.\"    \"Where?\"    \"Right there. I saw it before but I thought it was just part of him. But  if he's 'people,' maybe"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31583"],[0,"The Venus Trap (#5)"],[1,"  probably be here; I know you'll be glad to see Dr. Lakin again, and  you've been anxious to meet Dr. Cutler. They've been asking after you,  too. I think Dr. Lakin is planning to write a monograph on you for the  _Journal of the American Association of Professors of English  Literature_--with your permission, of course.\"    \"Christening--that's one of your native festivals, isn't it? It should  be most interesting.\"    \"That's right,\" Phyllis murmured. \"It will be Christmas soon. I'd almost  forgotten. It'll be the first Christmas I've ever spent away from home.  And there won't be any snow or--or anything.\" She started to guttate--to  cry again.    \"Cheer up, honey,\" Jim said. \"It won't be as bad as you think, because I  didn't forget Christmas was coming. There's something specially nice for  you on its way from Earth; I only hope it gets here on time.\" Phyllis  sniffled. \"Maybe we'll have a Christmas party, too. Would you like  that?\" But she remained unresponsive.    He turned to the tree. \"Christening's entirely different, though,\" he  explained. \"It's--I guess naming the fruit would be the best way to  describe it.\"    \"Is that so?\" Magnolia said. \"What kind of fruit do you expect to have,  Mrs. Haut? Oranges? Bananas? As your good St. Luke says, the tree is  known by its fruit. You look as if yours might be a watermelon.\"    \"Why, the--idea!\" Phyllis choked. \"Are you going to stand there, James,  and let that _vegetable_ insult me?\"    \"I'm sure she didn't mean to,\" he protested. \"She got confused by--that  zoology book I read her.\"    The door slammed behind his weeping wife.    \"I don't think you quite understand, Maggie,\" he said. \"In fact,  sometimes I almost think you, too, don't want to understand.\"    \"I know what kind of fruit it's going to be,\" the tree concluded  triumphantly. \"Sour apples.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Ouch,\" exclaimed Magnolia, \"that tickles! There's more to acting as a  Christmas tree than I had anticipated from your glowing descriptions,  Jim.\"    \"Here, dear,\" Phyllis said, \"maybe you'd better let me put the  decorations on her.\"    \"You can't get on the ladder in your condition,\" he said, apprehensive  not only for her welfare but for the tree's. Phyllis had not taken  kindly to the idea of having Magnolia as official Christmas tree,  suggesting that, if she must participate in the ceremonies, it might be  better in the capacity of Yule log. However, Jim knew Magnolia would be  offended if any other tree were chosen to be decorated.    \"I'll manage all right,\" he assured his wife. \"If you want to be useful,  you might put on some coffee and make sandwiches or something. The  bachelors are coming over from Base with that equipment that arrived  yesterday, and they'll probably be glad of a snack before turning in.\"    \"The coffee's already on and the canapes made,\" Phyllis smiled. \"And  I've baked cookies, too, and whipped up a batch of penuche. What kind of  a Christmas party do you think it would be without refreshments?\"    \"Very efficient, isn't she?\" Magnolia remarked, as the battery-powered  lights that James had affixed to her began to wink on, for the deep  red-violet dusk had already fallen and the first moon was rising. \"Have  you thought, Mrs. Haut, that if you fruit today, it will save the  expense of another festival?\"    \"I don't expect to fruit for another two months,\" Phyllis said coldly,  \"and why shouldn't we have another festival? We can afford it and I like  parties. I haven't been to one since the day I landed.\"    [Illustration]    \"Is the life out here getting a little quiet for you, petiole?\" the tree  asked solicitously. \"It must be hard when one has no intellectual  resources upon which to draw.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Phyllis held her peace for ten seconds; then, \"I wonder where those boys  can be,\" she said. \"I hope they bring some pickles along. I asked to  have some sent, but I'm accustomed to having no attention paid to what I  want.\"    \"There's a surprise coming for you, Phyllis,\" James could not help  telling her again, hoping to arouse some semblance of interest.  \"Something I know you'll love.... And for you, too,\" he said courteously  to Magnolia.    \"You mean the same surprise for both, or a surprise apiece?\" the tree  asked.    \"Oh, one for each, of course.\"    \"I see the lights of the 'copter now!\" Phyllis cried and, running out  into the middle of the lawn, began waving her handkerchief. He hadn't  seen her so pleasantly excited for a long time.    \"I don't suppose I'll need to turn on the landing lights,\" he said to  Magnolia. \"You should do the trick.\"    \"Am I all finished?\" she rustled anxiously. \"I do wish I could see  myself. How do I look?\"    [Illustration]    \"Splendid. I've never had as beautiful a Christmas tree as you, Maggie,\"  he told her with complete honesty. \"Not even on Earth.\"    \"I'm glad, Jim, but I still wish I could be more to you than just a  Christmas tree.\"    \"Shh. The others might hear.\"    For the helicopter had landed and the visitors were pouring out, with  shouts of admiration. Not only the bachelors had come--and in full  force--but some of the older men from Base, who apparently felt they  could manage to do without their wives for twelve hours, even if those  hours included Christmas Eve. He wondered where he and Phyllis could put  them all, but some could sleep outside, if need be, for it was never  cold on Elysium. The winds were gentle and the rains light and fragrant.           *       *       *       *       *    While the visitors were crowding around Phyllis and the tree, James  rooted eagerly through the packages they had brought, until he found  what he wanted. Then he rushed over to the group. \"I know I should wait  until tomorrow, but I want to give the girls their presents now.\" The  other men smiled sympathetically, almost as joyful as he. \"Merry  Christmas, Magnolia!\" He hoped Phyllis would understand that it was  etiquette which dictated that the alien life-form should get her gift  first.    \"Thank you,\" the tree said. \"I am deeply touched. I don't believe anyone  ever gave me a present before. What is it?\"    \"Liquid plant food--vitamins and minerals, you know. For you to drink.\"    \"What fun!\" she exclaimed in pretty excitement. \"Pour some over me right  now!\"    \"Not so fast, Jim, boy!\" Dr. Cutler, the biologist, snatched the jug  from James' hand. \"First you-all better let me take a sample of this  here stuff back to Base to test on a lower life-form, so's I can make  sure it won't do anything bad to Miss Magnolia. Might have iron in it  and I have a theory that iron may not be beneficial for the local  vegetation.\"    \"Oh, thank you!\" the tree rustled. \"It's so very thoughtful of you,  Doctor, but I'm sure Jim would never give me anything that would injure  me.\"    \"I'm sure he isn't fixing to do a thing like that, ma'am, but he's no  botanist.\"    \"And for you, Phyllis....\" James handed his wife the awkward bundle to  unwrap for herself.    She tore the papers off slowly. \"Oh, Jim, darling, it's--it's--\"    \"You wanted a bit of green, so I ordered a plant from Earth. You like  it? I hope you do.\"    \"Oh, _Jim_!\" She embraced him and the pot simultaneously. \"More than  _anything_!\"    \"It won't stay green,\" Magnolia observed. \"Either it'll turn blue or  it'll die. Puny-looking specimen, isn't it?\"    \"Well,\" said James, \"it's only a youngster. I guess this Christmas is  too early, but next Christmas there ought to be berries. It's a holly  plant, Phyl.\"    \"Holly,\" she repeated, her voice shaking a little. \"_Holly._\" She and  Dr. Cutler exchanged glances.    \"I told you, Miz Phyllis, ma'am--he may know the first thing about  botany, but he doesn't know anything after that.\"    \"Jim,\" Phyllis said, linking her free arm through his, \"I misjudged you.  Dr. Cutler is right. You don't know so very much about botany, after  all.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He looked at her blankly. Her voice was trembling, and not with tears  this time. \"I love this little plant; it's just what I wanted ... but  there aren't ever going to be any berries, because, to have berries, you  have to have two plants. And the right two. Holly's di--dio--it's just  like us.\"    \"Oh,\" James said, feeling thoroughly inadequate. \"I'm sorry.\"    \"But you mustn't be sorry. I'm going to plant it here on Elysium, and I  hope it will stay green in spite of what she says, and it'll have  blossoms anyway ... and it was very, very sweet of you, dear.\"    She kissed his cheek.    \"Is this one a boy or a girl?\" Magnolia asked.    \"You-all can't tell till it blooms, Miss Magnolia, ma'am,\" Dr. Cutler  informed her.    \"Maybe I can. Hand it up here, please.\"    Phyllis paused for an irresolute moment, then, smiling nervously at her  guests, obliged.    \"It's a boy,\" Magnolia announced, after a minute. \"A boy.\" She gave back  the pot reluctantly. \"Phyllis,\" she said, \"you and I have never been  friends and I admit that it's been my fault just as much as yours.\"    \"As much as mine?\" Phyllis echoed. \"I like that--\" and was going to go  on when she obviously recollected that they had company, and stopped.    \"So I know it's presumptuous of me to ask you a favor.\"    \"Yes, Magnolia?\" Phyllis said, her fine cornsilk eyebrows arched a  trifle. \"What is this favor?\"    \"When you plant the little fellow--you said you were going to,  anyhow--would you plant him near me?\"    Phyllis looked down at the plant she held cradled in her arms and then  up at the tree. \"Of course, Magnolia,\" she said, frowning slightly. \"I  didn't realize....\" Her voice began to tremble. \"I _have_ been pretty  rotten, haven't I?\" She looked toward James, but he turned his glance  away.    \"Just because you were a plant,\" Phyllis continued, \"didn't mean I had  to be a b-b-beast. It must have been awful for you, seeing me like this,  practically crowing over you, and knowing that you yourself"]]]
