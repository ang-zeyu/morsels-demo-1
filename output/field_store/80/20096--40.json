Mr. Gingham instinctively assumed the professional  air of hopeless melancholy.    As it was afterwards recorded, Mr. Smith stood and \"studied\" with the  tray in his hand for at least four minutes. Then he spoke.    \"Boys,\" he said, \"I'll be darned if I close down till I'm ready to close  down. I've got an idee. You wait and I'll show you.\"    And beyond that, not another word did Mr. Smith say on the subject.    But within forty-eight hours the whole town knew that something was  doing. The hotel swarmed with carpenters, bricklayers and painters.  There was an architect up from the city with a bundle of blue prints  in his hand. There was an engineer taking the street level with a  theodolite, and a gang of navvies with shovels digging like fury as if  to dig out the back foundations of the hotel.    \"That'll fool 'em,\" said Mr. Smith.    Half the town was gathered round the hotel crazy with excitement. But  not a word would the proprietor say. Great dray loads of square timber,  and two-by-eight pine joists kept arriving from the planing mill. There  was a pile of matched spruce sixteen feet high lying by the sidewalk.    Then the excavation deepened and the dirt flew, and the beams went up  and the joists across, and all the day from dawn till dusk the hammers  of the carpenters clattered away, working overtime at time and a half.    \"It don't matter what it costs,\" said Mr. Smith; \"get it done.\"    Rapidly the structure took form. It extended down the side street,  joining the hotel at a right angle. Spacious and graceful it looked as  it reared its uprights into the air.    Already you could see the place where the row of windows was to come, a  veritable palace of glass, it must be, so wide and commodious were they.  Below it, you could see the basement shaping itself, with a low ceiling  like a vault and big beams running across, dressed, smoothed, and ready  for staining. Already in the street there were seven crates of red and  white awning.    And even then nobody knew what it was, and it was not till the  seventeenth day that Mr. Smith, in the privacy of the back bar, broke  the silence and explained.    \"I tell you, boys,\" he says, \"it's a caff--like what they have in the  city--a ladies' and gent's caff, and that underneath (what's yours, Mr.  Mullins?) is a Rats' Cooler. And when I get her started, I'll hire a  French Chief to do the cooking, and for the winter I will put in a 'girl  room,' like what they have in the city hotels. And I'd like to see who's  going to close her up then.\"    Within two more weeks the plan was in operation. Not only was the caff  built but the very hotel was transformed. Awnings had broken out in a  red and white cloud upon its face, its every window carried a box of  hanging plants, and above in glory floated the Union Jack. The very  stationery was changed. The place was now Smith's Summer Pavilion. It  was advertised in the city as Smith's Tourists' Emporium, and Smith's  Northern Health Resort. Mr. Smith got the editor of the Times-Herald to  write up a circular all about ozone and the Mariposa pine woods, with  illustrations of the maskinonge (piscis mariposis) of Lake Wissanotti.    The Saturday after that circular hit the city in July, there were men  with fishing rods and landing nets pouring in on every train, almost  too fast to register. And if, in the face of that, a few little drops of  whiskey were sold over the bar, who thought of it?    But the caff! that, of course, was the crowning glory of the thing, that  and the Rats' Cooler below.    Light and cool, with swinging windows open to the air, tables with  marble tops, palms, waiters in white coats--it was the standing marvel  of Mariposa. Not a soul in the town except Mr. Smith, who knew it by  instinct, ever guessed that waiters and palms and marble tables can be  rented over the long distance telephone.    Mr. Smith was as good as his word. He got a French Chief with an  aristocratic saturnine countenance, and a moustache and imperial that  recalled the late Napoleon III. No one knew where Mr. Smith got him.  Some people in the town said he was a French marquis. Others said he was  a count and explained the difference.    No one in Mariposa had ever seen anything like the caff. All down the  side of it were the grill fires, with great pewter dish covers that went  up and down on a chain, and you could walk along the row and actually  pick out your own cutlet and then see the French marquis throw it on  to the broiling iron; you could watch a buckwheat pancake whirled  into existence under your eyes and see fowls' legs devilled, peppered,  grilled, and tormented till they lost all semblance of the original  Mariposa chicken.    Mr. Smith, of course, was in his glory.    \"What have you got to-day, Alf?\" he would say, as he strolled over to  the marquis. The name of the Chief was, I believe Alphonse, but \"Alf\"  was near enough for Mr. Smith.    The marquis would extend to the proprietor the menu, \"Voila, m'sieu, la  carte du jour.\"    Mr. Smith, by the way, encouraged the use of the French language in  the caff. He viewed it, of course, solely in its relation to the hotel  business, and, I think, regarded it as a recent invention.    \"It's comin' in all the time in the city,\" he said, \"and y'aint expected  to understand it.\"    Mr. Smith would take the carte between his finger and thumb and stare  at it. It was all covered with such devices as Potage la Mariposa--Filet  Mignon a la proprietaire--Cotellete a la Smith, and so on.    But the greatest thing about the caff were the prices. Therein lay, as  everybody saw at once, the hopeless simplicity of Mr. Smith.    The prices stood fast at 25 cents a meal. You could come in and eat all  they had in the caff for a quarter.    \"No, sir,\" Mr. Smith said stoutly, \"I ain't going to try to raise no  prices on the public. The hotel's always been a quarter and the caff's a  quarter.\"    Full? Full of people?    Well, I should think so! From the time the caff opened at 11 till it  closed at 8.30, you could hardly find a table. Tourists, visitors,  travellers, and half the people of Mariposa crowded at the little  tables; crockery rattling, glasses tinkling on trays, corks popping, the  waiters in their white coats flying to and fro, Alphonse whirling the  cutlets and pancakes into the air, and in and through it all, Mr.  Smith, in a white flannel suit and a broad crimson sash about his waist.  Crowded and gay from morning to night, and even noisy in its hilarity.    Noisy, yes; but if you wanted deep quiet and cool, if you wanted to step  from the glare of a Canadian August to the deep shadow of an enchanted  glade,--walk down below into the Rats' Cooler. There you had it; dark  old beams (who could believe they were put there a month ago?), great  casks set on end with legends such as Amontillado Fino done in gilt on  a black ground, tall steins filled with German beer soft as moss, and a  German waiter noiseless as moving foam. He who entered the Rats'  Cooler at three of a summer afternoon was buried there for the day. Mr.  Golgotha Gingham spent anything from four to seven hours there of every  day. In his mind the place had all the quiet charm of an interment, with  none of its sorrows.    But at night, when Mr. Smith and Billy, the desk clerk, opened up the  cash register and figured out the combined losses of the caff and the  Rats' Cooler, Mr. Smith would say:    \"Billy, just wait till I get the license renood, and I'll close up this  damn caff so tight they'll never know what hit her. What did that lamb  cost? Fifty cents a pound, was it? I figure it, Billy, that every one of  them hogs eats about a dollar's worth a grub for every twenty-five cents  they pay on it. As for Alf--by gosh, I'm through with him.\"    But that, of course, was only a confidential matter as between Mr. Smith  and Billy.    I don't know at what precise period it was that the idea of a petition  to the License Commissioners first got about the town. No one seemed to  know just who suggested it. But certain it was that public opinion  began to swing strongly towards the support of Mr. Smith. I think it was  perhaps on the day after the big fish dinner that Alphonse cooked for  the Mariposa Canoe Club (at twenty cents a head) that the feeling began  to find open expression. People said it was a shame that a man like Josh  Smith should be run out of Mariposa by three license commissioners. Who  were the license commissioners, anyway? Why, look at the license system  they had in Sweden; yes, and in Finland and in South America. Or, for  the matter of that, look at the French and Italians, who drink all day  and all night. Aren't they all right? Aren't they a musical people? Take  Napoleon, and Victor Hugo; drunk half the time, and yet look what they  did.    I quote these arguments not for their own sake, but merely to indicate  the changing temper of public opinion in Mariposa. Men would sit in the  caff at lunch perhaps for an hour and a half and talk about the license  question in general, and then go down into the Rats' Cooler and talk  about it for two hours more.    It was amazing the way the light broke in in the case of particular  individuals, often the most unlikely, and quelled their opposition.    Take, for example, the editor of the Newspacket. I suppose there wasn't  a greater temperance advocate in town. Yet Alphonse queered him with an  Omelette a la License in one meal.    Or take Pepperleigh himself, the judge of the Mariposa court. He was  put to the bad with a game pie,--pate normand aux fines herbes--the  real thing, as good as a trip to Paris in itself. After eating it,  Pepperleigh had the common sense to realize that it was sheer madness to  destroy a hotel that could cook a thing like that.    In the same way, the secretary of the School Board was silenced with a  stuffed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#5)"],[1,"pride, that he was never  brought before a court martial or found delinquent in his duty.    Heber was also a Free Mason. In 1823 he received the first three  degrees of masonry in the lodge at Victor. The year following, himself  and five others petitioned the chapter at Canandaigua, the county seat  of Ontario County, for the degrees up to the Royal Arch. The petition  was favorably considered, but before it could be acted upon the Morgan  anti-mason riot broke out, and the Masonic Hall, where the chapter  met, was burned by the mob and all the records consumed.    Says Heber, \"There are thousands of Masons who lived in those days,  who are well aware of the persecution and unjust proceedings which  were heaped upon them by the anti-Masons; not as many as three of us  could meet together, unless in secret, without being mobbed.    \"I have been as true as an angel from the heavens to the covenants I  made in the lodge at Victor.    \"No man was admitted into a lodge in those days except he bore a good  moral character, and was a man of steady habits; and a man would be  suspected for getting drunk, or any other immoral conduct. I wish that  all men were masons and would live up to their profession; then the  world would be in a much better state than it is now.\"    Commenting on the degeneracy of the Ancient Order--the old, old story  of the persecuted becoming persecutors--he continues:    \"I have been driven from my houses and possessions, with many of my  brethren belonging to that fraternity, five times, by mobs led by some  of their leading men. Hyrum Smith received the first three degrees of  masonry in Ontario County, New York. Joseph and Hyrum Smith were  Master Masons, yet they were massacred through the instrumentality of  some of the leading men of that fraternity, and not one soul of them  has ever stepped forth to administer help to me or my brethren  belonging to the Masonic Institution, or to render us assistance,  although bound under the strongest obligations to be true and faithful  to each other in every case and under every circumstance, the  commission of crime excepted.\"    Yes, Masons, it is said, were even among the mob that murdered Joseph  and Hyrum in Carthage Jail. Joseph, leaping the fatal window, gave the  masonic signal of distress. The answer was the roar of his murderers'  muskets and the deadly balls that pierced his heart.    Heber continued to prosper in business, working in his pottery in  summer, and at his forge in winter. He purchased land, built houses,  planted orchards, and otherwise \"situated himself to live comfortably.\"    In the spring of 1825, he gave his father a home with him in Mendon.  The old gentleman was now a widower, his wife, Heber's mother, having  died in February, 1824, at West Bloomfield, of consumption. Her  husband survived her a little over a twelve-month, when he, too, fell  a victim to the same malady.    It is a coincidence worthy of note that the deaths of Heber and Vilate  were also about one year apart, she passing away first, and he, like  his father, following soon the footsteps of his beloved partner to the  spirit land.    We have traced his life's record through its initial stages. He was  now fairly on the threshold of his remarkable career.          CHAPTER III.    HEBER'S POETIC NATURE--A ROUGH DIAMOND--EARLY RELIGIOUS  EXPERIENCE--JOINS THE BAPTIST CHURCH--\"SIGNS IN THE HEAVENS  ABOVE\"--HEBER C. KIMBALL AND BRIGHAM YOUNG--THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL.      Heber's temperament was religious and poetical. Sociable as he was,  and even bubbling over with mirth, at times, his soul was essentially  of a solemn cast. He loved solitude, not with the selfish spirit of  the misanthrope, but for the opportunities it gave of communing with  his own thoughts--a pleasure that only poet minds truly feel--and of  listening to the voice of God and nature, expressed in all the  countless and varied forms of life.    He was capable of sensing fully--though probably he had never seen or  heard--those sublime words of the poet:        \"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods;        There is a rapture on the lonely shore;      There is society, where none intrudes,        By the deep sea, and music in its roar.        I love not man the less, but nature more,      From these our interviews; in which I steal        From all I may be, or have been before,      To mingle with the universe and feel      What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.\"    True, he was a diamond in the rough, but a diamond, nevertheless, for  all of its incrustations. Unlettered and untaught, save in nature's  school, the university of experience, where he was an apt and profound  scholar, he was possessed of marvelous intuition, a genius God-given,  which needed no kindling at a college shrine to prepare it for the  work which providence had designed.    Not but that education would have polished the gem, causing it to  shine with what the natural eye would deem a brighter lustre; but the  fact remains that Heber C. Kimball, as he was, not as he might have  been, was best adapted for the divine purpose, the career marked out  for him by the finger of Deity.    It is not strange that a nature of this kind, solemn, thoughtful and  inspirational, should have been led early to seek \"an anchor for the  soul,\" a knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. But his  search for many years was in vain; he found not among the sects of  Christendom the precious pearl which an honest soul will sell all that  it hath to obtain.    \"From the time I was twelve years old,\" says he, \"I had many serious  thoughts and strong desires to obtain a knowledge of salvation, but  not finding anyone who could teach me the things of God, I did not  embrace any principles of doctrine, but endeavored to live a moral  life. The priests would tell me to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,  but never would tell me what to do to be saved, and thus left me  almost in despair.    \"During the time I lived in Mendon, I mostly attended the meetings of  the Baptist church, and was often invited to unite myself with them. I  received many pressing invitations to unite with different sects, but  did not see fit to comply with their desires, until a revival took  place in our neighborhood. I had passed through several of their  protracted meetings and had been many times upon the anxious bench to  seek relief from the 'bands of sin and death.' But no relief could I  find until the meetings were passed by.    \"At this time I concluded to put myself under the watch-care of the  Baptist church and unite myself to them; as soon as I had concluded to  do this, the Lord administered peace to my mind, and accordingly, the  next day I went, in company with my wife, and we were baptized by  Elder Elijah Weaver; and we partook of the sacrament on that day for  the first and also the last time with them.\"    Such was his initiation into religion, as pertaining to a Christian  sectarian church. Though not in accord with the Baptist faith in all  its teachings, it seemed to him to be nearest right according to the  Bible; probably from the stress laid upon baptism by immersion,  manifestly the Bible mode, and the only true way of being \"born of the  water.\" Besides, he deemed it wise to put a \"guard\" upon himself, to  \"keep him from running into evils.\"    The peace of mind that he experienced, as the sanction of the Holy One  upon a prudent and conscientious act, was but the prelude and prophecy  of far greater things to follow. The heavens were bestirring  themselves. The invisible world was up in arms. Truth and Error were  taking the field. The latter-day conflict had begun. The signs of the  coming of the Son of Man were showing themselves in the heavens.    It was the eventful night of September 22nd, 1827. Says Heber C.  Kimball:    \"I had retired to bed, when John P. Greene, who was living within a  hundred steps of my house, came and waked me up, calling upon me to  come out and behold the scenery in the heavens. I woke up and called  my wife and Sister Fanny Young (sister to Brigham Young), who was  living with us, and we went out-of-doors.    \"It was one of the most beautiful starlight nights, so clear that we  could see to pick up a pin. We looked to the eastern horizon, and  beheld a white smoke arise toward the heavens; as it ascended it  formed itself into a belt, and made a noise like the sound of a mighty  wind, and continued southwest, forming a regular bow dipping in the  western horizon. After the bow had formed, it began to widen out and  grow clear and transparent, of a bluish cast; it grew wide enough to  contain twelve men abreast.    \"In this bow an army moved, commencing from the east and marching to  the west; they continued marching until they reached the western  horizon. They moved in platoons, and walked so close that the rear  ranks trod in the steps of their file leaders, until the whole bow was  literally crowded with soldiers. We could distinctly see the muskets,  bayonets and knapsacks of the men, who wore caps and feathers like  those used by the American soldiers in the last war with Britain; and  also saw their officers with their swords and equipage, and the  clashing and jingling of their implements of war, and could discover  the forms and features of the men. The most profound order existed  throughout the entire army; when the foremost man stepped, every man  stepped at the same time; I could hear the steps. When the front rank  reached the western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly  hear the report of arms and the rush.    \"No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as  plainly as ever I saw armies of men in the flesh; it seemed as though  every hair of my head was alive. This scenery we gazed upon for hours,  until it began to disappear.    \"After I became acquainted with Mormonism, I learned that this took  place the same evening that Joseph "]]]
