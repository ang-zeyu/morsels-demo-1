Considering the degree of development of the young  at birth, the gestation periods are about what a person would expect: 26  to 30 days in _Sylvilagus_ and 36 to 47 days in _Lepus_ (see Severaid,  1950:356-357). Vernacular names are misleading because the names jack  rabbit and snowshoe rabbit are applied to hares; also, Belgian hare is a  name applied to a rabbit (genus _Oryctolagus_) that is commonly bred in  captivity. There are many domestic strains and varieties of  _Oryctolagus_ and the animals are second only to poultry in some areas  as a protein food for man. Also, the pelts are sold as a source of felt  and many of the skins are dyed and processed for making fur coats and  other fur-pieces that appear on the market under names not readily  associated with rabbit.    Rabbits and hares are crepuscular and possibly more nocturnal than  diurnal. So far as I know they do not store food as do their diurnal  relatives, the pikas. Some leporids, however, have an unusual, and  possibly unique, method of processing food: Two types of vegetable  pellets are expelled from the anal opening of the digestive tract; the  dark brownish pellets, from which the nutriments have been extracted,  are feces, but the greenish pellets seem to be only slightly predigested  foods which are re-eaten. Southern (1942:553), among others, has written  about this. This system functionally resembles that in the ruminants  where a cud of vegetation is returned to the mouth, from one part of the  stomach, to be re-chewed and finally swallowed.    Because the causative organism of a disease that decimates dense  populations of small mammals, and some other kinds of vertebrates, was  isolated first in leporids, this disease, tularemia, is more associated  in the popular mind with rabbits than with other kinds of mammals.  Actually, many kinds of mammals are quite as likely to have tularemia as  are rabbits. Now that streptomycin is available, cases of tularemia in  persons are easily cured.

All the more certain was Laura that  she could tramp over the whole island with Tom Cutts, or she could sit  and knit or sew, and Tom could read to her, and these days were the  happiest days of her married life, and brought back the old sunny days  of the times before Fort Sumter again. Ah me! if such days of summer and  such days of autumn would last forever!    But they will not last forever. November came, and the little colony  went into winter quarters. December came. And we were all double-banked  with sea-weed. The stoves were set up in-doors. The double doors were  put on outside, and we were all ready for the \"Osprey.\" The \"Osprey\" was  the Government steamer which was to bring us our supplies for the  winter, chiefly of colza oil,--and perhaps some coal. But the \"Osprey\"  does not appear. December is half gone, and no \"Osprey.\" We can put the  stoves on short allowance, but not our two lanterns. They will only run  to the 31st of January, the nights are so long, if the \"Osprey\" does not  come before then.    That is our condition, when old Mipples, bringing back the mail, brings  a letter from Boston to say that the \"Osprey\" has broken her  main-shaft, and may not be repaired before the 15th of January,--that  Mr. Cutts, will therefore, if he needs oil, take an early opportunity to  supply himself from the light at Squire's,--and that an order on the  keeper at Squire's is enclosed.    To bring a cask of oil from Squire's is no difficult task to a Tripp's  Cove man. It would be no easy one, dear reader, to you and me. Squire's  is on the mainland,--our nearest neighbor at the Bell and Hammer,--it  revolves once a minute, and we watch it every night in the horizon. Tom  waited day by day for a fine day,--would not have gone for his oil  indeed till the New Year came in, but that Jotham Fields, the other  assistant, came down with a fever turn wholly beyond Laura's management,  and she begged Tom to take the first fine day to carry him to a doctor.  To bring a doctor to him was out of the question.    \"And what will you do?\" said Tom.    \"Do? I will wait till you come home. Start any fine day after you have  wound up the lights on the last beat,--take poor Jotham to his mother's  house,--and if you want you may bring back your oil. I shall get along  with the children very well,--and I will have your dinner hot when you  come home.\"    Tom doubted. But the next day Jotham was worse. Mipples voted for  carrying him ashore, and Laura had her way. The easier did she have it,  because the south wind blew softly, and it was clear to all men that the  run could be made to Squire's in a short two hours. Tom finally agreed  to start early the next morning. He would not leave his sick man at his  mother's, but at Squire's, and the people there could put him home. The  weather was perfect, and an hour before daylight they were gone. They  were all gone,--all three had to go. Mipples could not handle the boat  alone, nor could Tom; far less could one of them manage the boat, take  the oil, and see to poor Jotham also. Wise or not, this was the plan.    An hour before daylight they were gone. Half an hour after sunrise they  were at Squire's. But the sun had risen red, and had plumped into a  cloud. Before Jotham was carried up the cliff the wind was northwest,  and the air was white with snow. You could not see the house from the  boat, nor the boat from the house. You could not see the foremast of  the boat from your seat in the stern-sheets, the air was so white with  snow. They carried Jotham up. But they told John Wilkes, the keeper at  Squire's, that they would come for the oil another day. They hurried  down the path to the boat again, pushed her off, and headed her to the  northeast determined not to lose a moment in beating back to the Bell  and Hammer. Who would have thought the wind would haul back so without a  sign of warning?    \"Will it hold up, Simon?\" said Tom to Mipples, wishing he might say  something encouraging.    And all Simon Mipples would say was,--    \"God grant it may!\"           *       *       *       *       *    And Laura saw the sun rise red and burning. And Laura went up into the  tower next the house, and put out the light there. Then she left the  children in their cribs, and charged the little boy not to leave till  she came back, and ran down to the door to go and put out the other  light,--and as she opened it the blinding snow dashed in her face. She  had not dreamed of snow before. But her water-proof was on, she pulled  on her boots, ran quickly along the path to the other light, two  hundred yards perhaps, climbed the stairway and extinguished that, and  was at home again before the babies missed her.    For an hour or two Laura occupied herself with her household cares, and  pretended to herself that she thought this was only a snow flurry that  would soon clear away. But by the time it was ten o'clock she knew it  was a stiff north-wester, and that her husband and Mipples were caught  on shore. Yes, and she was caught with her babies alone on the island.  Wind almost dead ahead to a boat from Squire's too, if that made any  difference. That crossed Laura's mind. Still she would not brood. Nay,  she did not brood, which was much better than saying she would not  brood. It crossed her mind that it was the day before Christmas, and  that the girls at Tripp's were dressing the meeting-house for dear old  Parson Spaulding. And then there crossed her mind the dear old man's  speech at all weddings, \"As you climb the hill of life together, my dear  young friends,\" and poor Laura, as she kissed the baby once again, had  courage to repeat it all aloud to her and her brother, to the infinite  amazement of them both. They opened their great eyes to the widest as  Laura did so. Nay, Laura had the heart to take a hatchet, and work out  to leeward of the house, into a little hollow behind the hill, and cut  up a savin bush from the thicket, and bring that in, and work for an  hour over the leaves so as to make an evergreen frame to hang about  General Cutts's picture. She did this that Tom might see she was not  frightened when he got home.    _When_ he got home! Poor girl! at the very bottom of her heart was the  other and real anxiety,--_if_ he got home. Laura knew Tom, of course,  better than he knew himself, and she knew old Mipples too. So she knew,  as well as she knew that she was rubbing black lead on the stove, while  she thought these things over,--she knew that they would not stay at  Squire's two minutes after they had landed Jotham Fields. She knew they  would do just what they did,--put to sea, though it blew guns, though  now the surf was running its worst on the Seal's Back. She knew, too,  that if they had not missed the island, they would have been here, at  the latest, before eleven o'clock. And by the time it was one she could  no longer doubt that they had lost the island, and were tacking about  looking for it in the bay, if, indeed, in that gale they dared to tack  at all. No! Laura knew only too well, that where they were was beyond  her guessing; that the good God and they two only knew.    \"Come here, Tom, and let me tell you a story! Once there was a little  boy, and he had two kittens. And he named one kitten Muff, and he named  one kitten Buff!\"--    Whang!    What was that?    \"Tom, darling, take care of baby; do not let her get out of the cradle,  while mamma goes to the door.\" Downstairs to the door. The gale has  doubled its rage. How ever did it get in behind the storm-door outside?  That \"_whang_\" was the blow with which the door, wrenched off its  hinges, was flung against the side of the wood-house. Nothing can be  done but to bolt the storm-door to the other passage, and bolt the outer  window shutters, and then go back to the children.    \"Once there was a little boy, and he had two kittens, and he named one  Minna, and one Brenda\"--    \"No, mamma, no! one Muff, and one\"--    \"Oh, yes! my darling! once there was a little boy, and he had two  kittens, and he named one Buff, and one Muff. And one day he went to  walk\"--    Heavens! the lanterns! Who was to trim the lamps? Strange to say,  because this was wholly out of her daily routine, the men always caring  for it of course, Laura had not once thought of it till now. And now it  was after one o'clock. But now she did think of it with a will. \"Come,  Tommy, come and help mamma.\" And she bundled him up in his thickest  storm rig. \"Come up into the lantern.\" Here the boy had never come  before. He was never frightened when he was with her. Else he might well  have been frightened. And he was amazed there in the whiteness; drifts  of white snow on the lee-side and the weather-side; clouds of white snow  on the south-west sides and north-east sides; snow; snow everywhere;  nothing but whiteness wherever he looked round.    Laura made short shift of those wicks which had burned all through the  night before. But she had them ready. She wound up the carcels for their  night's work. Again and again she drew her oil and filled up her  reservoirs. And as she did so, an old text came on her, and she wondered  whether Father Spaulding knew how good a text it would be for  Christmas. And the fancy touched her, poor child, and as she led little  Tom down into the nursery again, she could not help opening into the  Bible Parson Spaulding gave her and reading:--    \"'But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the  bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.' Dear Tommy, dear  Tommy, my own child, we will not sleep, will we? 'While the bridegroom  tarried,' O my dear Father in Heaven, let him come. 'And at midnight  there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet  him;'\" and she devoured little Tommy with kisses, and cried, \"We will  go, my darling, we will go, if he comes at the first hour,--or the  second,--or the third! But now Tommy"]]]
