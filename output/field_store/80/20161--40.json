[New Series.], December 14, 1878 (#5)"],[1,"the people had already been sufficiently  educated up to an appreciation of their sanitary value not to permit  it. Dr. Seguin eloquently advocated the improvement of the parks,  to make them not only pleasure grounds, but places of aesthetical and  practical out-door education of the public school children.    IV. _Ventilation_.--It would be a great step in the interests of  sanitary science if builders, vestrymen, and school or hospital  trustees could be persuaded that their offices did not make them  temporary authorities on ventilation, and that they had best intrust  this matter to specialists who have fought their way into successful  practice.    It appears that both the system of ventilation by aspiration and  that by propulsion have had great successes and great failures. Many  authorities have declared in favor of mechanical ventilation, yet in  most institutions where fans had been introduced they are now standing  still. In Roosevelt Hospital, New York, they ran their fan backwards  for months and then stopped it.    V. _Physical Education_.--Instruction in hygiene and physical  exercise as a part of the college curriculum was first successfully  accomplished at Amherst College, and has now had a trial of nearly  twenty years. The importance attached to it is shown by the fact that  only distinguished members of the medical profession are appointed  as professors, and that they have the same rank as the rest of the  faculty. Their first duty is to know the physical condition of every  student and to see that the laws of health are not violated. In case  of sickness, the students are given certificates to excuse them from  attendance and are put in the way of obtaining suitable treatment. The  records kept are of great interest. All the classes are required to  attend the gymnastic exercises four times a week. For a full account  see Professor Hitchcock's report on Hygiene at Amherst College to  the American Public Health Association. The excellent results of this  feature--it can no longer be regarded as an experiment--recommend its  introduction in all our colleges and public schools.    VI. _Health Resorts_.--The number of people who leave the cities in  the summer to visit the seashore, the mountains, and the country is  annually increasing. A healthful village is often changed to a center  of pestilence merely by such an influx of strangers, the ordinary  means of removing offal, etc., being no longer adequate. The town of  Bethlehem, N. H., became so popular by reason of its pure air that  several thousand hay fever patients sought relief there in 1877.  The consequence was insufficient drainage; but as the inhabitants  understood their interests, this defect was at once remedied.    The sea shore of New Jersey from Sandy Hook to Cape May is becoming  an almost continuous city, and harbors a multitude of visitors every  summer. Those whose interest it is to retain this patronage  cannot have it too strongly impressed upon them to preserve their  healthfulness by introducing cemented cisterns, by causing garbage to  be removed daily, and by encouraging local boards of health.    VII. _Illuminating Gas_ not only withdraws from the air of our rooms a  considerable amount of oxygen, but fills them with noxious products of  combustion. All this may be avoided in the future by the introduction  of the electric light.    VIII. _Sanitary Surveys_.--Dr. Bowditch has shown that a thousand  deaths from consumption in Massachusetts are due to a wet and  retentive soil, and this fact alone will show the importance of  sanitary surveys of the country, such as that made of Staten Island  by Professors Newberry and Trowbridge, who determined the influence  of the surface soil, of the underlying rock, its porosity, its bedding  and its joints, upon the drainage and upon the local climate and  health. A similar survey of Hudson county, New Jersey, has been  recently made by L. B. Heard, C.E.    IX. _Composition of the Atmosphere_.--The English government has  been obliged to appoint the celebrated Dr. Angus Smith to examine  the effects of atmospheric contamination. In Philadelphia there is  scarcely a house front that is not disfigured by the stain of magnesia  and lime salts, caused by acid vapors in the atmosphere.    A discussion followed, which was introduced by Mr. Collingwood, who  remarked that the problem of the sewage of cities was still far from  being solved. Though the recent experiments in England on utilizing  sewage for agricultural purposes by filtration and otherwise were  reported to be successful, we had only dodged the question in this  country. Our sewage is still emptied into rivers to poison the water  of cities further down their course. When the country becomes more  thickly settled, this will answer no longer.    It was also stated that while gas in large chandeliers could be made  an effective means of ventilation, there was another objection to its  use in the fact that the soil of the city was everywhere impregnated  with it from leaky mains, thus causing poisonous exhalations and an  insufferable odor whenever the ground was opened. Attention was also  called to the evil effects of the system of tenement houses, which led  to an unfavorable comparison of the health and morality of New York  with those of cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland, that abound in  small homes.    Dr. Minor attributed disease to what Richardson calls  \"ultra-microscopic molecular aggregates,\" which always exist in  the air, but take hold of us only when our vitality is reduced to a  certain point. It has been shown that decay is absolutely impossible  in vessels from which they are excluded. But for them the earth would  now be heaped with the undecomposed remains of animals and vegetables.  According to this view, the future efforts of sanitary science must be  simply in the direction of learning how to protect ourselves against  the \"ultra-microscopic molecular aggregates.\"    C. F. K.           *       *       *       *       *          FELLING TREES BY ELECTRICITY.      Some years ago a Doctor Robinson of this city obtained a patent  through the agency of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN for Felling Trees by  Electricity. Subsequently a description of the invention was published  in this paper, soon after which the newspapers in this country  and Europe teemed with the account of a gentleman in India having  contrived an apparatus for felling trees in the same manner. Since  these several years have elapsed we have heard nothing of the  gentleman from India till a few days ago our papers have taken up the  subject anew, and annexed is the account they give of the inventor's  progress in developing his discovery.    The electric fluid in the form of lightning oftentimes proves itself  a very efficient wood cutter, and it has occurred to some ingenious  gentleman in India that artificial electricity may be so applied and  controlled as to cut down trees a good deal faster than the clumsy  ax or that American notion the chain saw. The two ends of the copper  wires of a galvanic battery are connected with platinum wire, which of  course instantly becomes red hot, and while in that state it is gently  seesawed across the trunk of the trees to be felled. When arrangements  were made for the experiment, it turned out that the thickness of  the thickest platinum wire that could be got was only that of crochet  cotton. It was at once seen that such a wire would be consumed before  the tree was half severed from its trunk. However, the attempt was  made. The burning wire performed its task very well as long as it  lasted, but, as anticipated, the wire continually broke, and at  length there was no wire left. There can be little doubt that, with  a stronger battery and a thicker wire, the experiment would have been  entirely successful. As it was, the tree was sawn one fifth through.           *       *       *       *       *          AN IMPROVED VISE.      The novel vise shown in the engraving was recently patented by Mr.  William Starkey, of Pittsburg, Pa.    [Illustration: STARKEY'S VISE.]    The fixed jaw is supported by two standards from the base piece, and  has a square boxing or tube for receiving the slide of the movable  jaw. This slide is hollow, and contains a rack which is engaged by a  pinion on the short vertical shaft, which is supported by the fixed  jaw. At the lower end of the vertical shaft there is a worm wheel,  that is engaged by a worm on the horizontal shaft on which is placed  the hand wheel. By turning the hand wheel the vertical shaft is  rotated and the movable jaw is drawn against the object to be clamped  by the vise.           *       *       *       *       *          CULINARY USES FOR LEAVES.      A writer in the London _Iron Trade Exchange_, calling attention to a  neglected source of culinary flavors, says:    \"With the exception of sweet and bitter herbs, grown chiefly for the  purpose, and parsley, which is neither bitter nor sweet, but the most  popular of all flavoring plants, comparatively few other leaves are  used. Perhaps I ought also to except the sweet bay, which is popular  in rice and other puddings, and certainly imparts one of the most  pleasant and exquisite flavors; but, on the other hand, what a waste  there is of the flavoring properties of peach, almond, and laurel  leaves, so richly charged with the essence of bitter almonds, so  much used in most kitchens! Of course such leaves must be used with  caution, but so must the spirit as well. An infusion of these could  readily be made, either green or dry, and a tea or table spoonful of  the flavoring liquid used. One of the most useful and harmless of all  leaves for flavoring is that of the common syringa. When cucumbers are  scarce, these are a perfect substitute in salads or anything in which  that flavor is desired. The taste is not only like that of cucumbers,  but identical--a curious instance of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38482"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XLIII.—No. 1. [New Series.], July 3, 1880 (#5)"],[1,"varying intensity  of the sound transmitted by the resonators, turns until their  openings touch the same sound waves simultaneously, which position  he recognizes either by the great augmentation of the sound (when the  tube lengths are equal), or by the cessation of the sound, when the  tubes vary so that the interference of the sound waves is perfect. In  either case the determination of the direction of the source of the  sound is almost instantaneous, and the two methods may be successively  employed as checks upon each other's report.    It is obvious that with such a help the pilot in a fog need never be  long in doubt as to the direction of a warning signal; and if need  be he can without much delay, by successive observations and a little  calculation, determine, approximately at least, the distance of the  sounding body.           *       *       *       *       *          EFFECT OF AGE ON THE QUALITY OF IRON.    Professor Bauschinger, in 1878, tested iron taken from a chain bridge  built in 1829, and found that fifty years of use had not perceptibly  altered its quality--either its strength or its elasticity--as  reported at the time of its erection. He also examined metal from  another bridge built in 1852, and found that the average quality  remained as given by Von Pauli at the time of its erection.    Professor Thurston, testing pieces of the wire cable of the Fairmount  Suspension Bridge, recently taken down at Philadelphia, after about  forty years' use, found the iron to have a tenacity and elasticity  and a ductility fully equal to the best wire of same size found in the  market to-day.    He therefore concludes that iron subjected to strains such as are met  with in properly designed bridges does not deteriorate with age.           *       *       *       *       *          A COLLISION BETWEEN LARGE PASSENGER STEAMERS.    During a fog near midnight, June 11, two of the large passenger  steamers plying on Long Island Sound, Stonington line, between New  York and Boston, came in collision, while running at considerable  speed. One of the boats, the Narragansett, was struck near the middle,  her side cut open, and a smoke-pipe knocked over, which made a down  draught through the furnace, driving out a great sheet of burning  gas into the cabins and between decks, by which the vessel was set on  fire, at the same time the opening in her side caused her to begin  to sink. Some three hundred passengers were on board, and a frightful  scene of confusion followed. Happily there was a plentiful supply  of life-preservers, some life-rafts, and a few life-boats. There was  delay in lowering the boats, but the rafts, life-preservers, chairs,  and other floatables served to support most of the unfortunate people,  who, to escape the flames, were obliged to leap quickly into the  water. About fifty lives were lost; the remainder were rescued by  boats from another steamer, the New York, also by help sent from the  other damaged vessel, the Stonington.    It seems remarkable that so many were saved. This calamity illustrates  the necessity for further effort on the part of inventors to discover  new and improved means for fog signaling, saving life, preventing the  spread of fires, and keeping vessels afloat. Most of the large local  steamers that communicate with New York are veritable palaces,  built regardless of expense, and supplied with every known reliable  appliance for safety; but the occurrence of accidents like this and  their disastrous results show that much remains to be done before  navigation, even upon smooth waters, can be considered secure.    The life-rafts of the Narragansett seem to have proved more useful  than the life-boats in rescuing the drowning people, the rafts being  more quickly and easily launched, requiring less skill, etc.    The upperworks of our river and Sound passenger steamers consist at  present of a mass of light, dry woodwork, forming cabins that are very  comfortable and commodious for travelers, but highly dangerous in case  of fire.    The collision of river steamers above described was followed a few  hours later by a collision between two great ocean steamers, accounts  of which we give in another column.           *       *       *       *       *          HONORS TO AN AGED CHEMIST.    The chemists of Germany are collecting money for the purpose of  presenting a gold medal to Prof. Woehler on his eightieth birthday,  which will be July 31, 1880. Prof. Woehler is one of the most  distinguished as well as the oldest of living chemists. Himself  a pupil of old Berzelius, a contemporary of Liebig, and the loved  instructor of many of our best chemists, his name is equally respected  on both sides of the Atlantic. Profs. Jay and Chandler, of Columbia  College, New York city, two of his former pupils, are receiving  contributions from those who wish to join in this well deserved  memorial.           *       *       *       *       *          PERSEVERANCE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.    A good lesson to young people inclined to exaggerate the hinderances  to their success in life, and to think that their chances are too poor  to justify honest exertion, is furnished by a young colored man of  Columbus, Ohio, F. P. Williams by name, now serving in that city as  census enumerator. Several years ago he was run over by a train of  cars, his arms being so mutilated that both had to be taken off near  the shoulder. Lacking hands he learned to write legibly by holding his  pencil between his teeth. He writes quite rapidly, and in his work as  enumerator takes an average of 200 names a day.           *       *       *       *       *          MAXIM'S NEW GAS MACHINE    [_Continued from first page._]      escape through the jet, L. This produces a partial vacuum at L, and  draws air in at C. The air and steam pass with great rapidity through  the tube, G. The action of the air and steam produces another  partial vacuum at N, which draws gasoline in through the pipe, B. The  adjustment of the opening is such that one pound of steam draws in air  sufficient for two pounds of gasoline. The heat of the steam is taken  up by the refrigeration caused by the evaporation of the gasoline, so  that at E the compound is carbureted air and cold water. The tube, F,  presents the curious phenomenon of being hot at _a_ and cold at _b_.  In one short piece of tube we have a hot retort and a cold condenser.  The supply of gasoline is regulated by the valve, D. The dash pot,  H, prevents a too rapid action of the valve, I. Gas of any desired  density may be made, and when once adjusted the gas does not vary. The  burner used with this machine is made to produce the very best results  attainable, and then the gas is regulated to a density and pressure  to suit the burner. The nuisance of an adjustable burner is thus  obviated.    The holder closes off the supply when full, and lets on a supply when  nearly empty. Gasoline has been much improved within a few years. It  is now so very cheap that the equivalent of one thousand feet of coal  gas of standard quality may be equaled for sixty cents. Where no steam  is at hand these machines are run with a small oil burner. They are  being made by the Pennsylvania Globe Gas Light Co., 131 Arch St.,  Philadelphia, Pa., of from 100 to 10,000 burner power.    This machine was patented June 8, 1880.    [Illustration: Fig 2.    MAXIM'S GAS MACHINE--SECTION OF INJECTOR]             *       *       *       *       *          PREVENTION OF BOILER EXPLOSIONS.    This vexed problem has occupied the minds of engineers and inventors  since the introduction of steam as a motive power, and there are  several theories of boiler explosions, each having its adherents. Of  course there are conditions under which a boiler explosion is involved  in no mystery; as, for example, when the water is dangerously low,  when the safety valve is of insufficient capacity, or when it is  unduly loaded; but there are other cases where an explosion cannot be  rationally explained in the light of the well known theories.    Mr. Daniel T. Lawson, of Wellsville, Ohio, has recently patented,  in this and several other countries, a device for preventing boiler  explosions, which appears practical, and according to the testimony of  scientific men the claims of the inventor are well founded.    The inventor, in explaining his invention, says that when water  is superheated it becomes as explosive as gunpowder, exploding by  bursting into steam from a reduction of pressure. When the engineer  opens the throttle valve the cylinder is instantly filled with steam,  creating a vacuum to that extent in the boiler. The superheated water  then immediately rises to fill the vacuum, and is met by the valve,  instantly cutting off the escape into the cylinder; this causes a  concussion on every square inch in the boiler much greater than the  regular pressure of the steam. There is abundant reason to believe  that it is this concussive action which causes the numerous and  mysterious boiler explosions, and which cause is wholly independent of  the amount of water in the boiler; in fact, the greater the amount of  water in the boiler the more terrific the explosion.    This invention, which is based upon this theory, consists in reducing  the concussive strain produced by the impulsive and intermittent  escape of steam to the cylinders to an approximately uniform pressure,  by rendering the evolution or passage of steam from the water to the  steam space approximately constant and independent of the intermittent  discharges from the steam space to the cylinder. The means for  accomplishing this consist in a boiler constructed with a partition,  A, intervening between the water space and the space from which the  steam is taken to supply the cylinder, and feeding the steam as it  is generated through valves or orifices, B, in the partition, of a  smaller size than the port or opening through which the"]]]
