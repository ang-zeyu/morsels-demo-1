Michigan, 563:7-8,      March 29, 1955.    _Diagnosis._--Maximum snout-vent length in males 40 mm.; snout in  dorsal profile round; tarsal fold strong; inner metatarsal tubercle  round and moderate in size; outer metatarsal tubercle small and  indistinct; webbing on foot extending to middle of penultimate phalanx  of fourth toe; nuptial spines on thumb large; thoracic fold present;  anal opening at level of middle of thighs; dorsum dull grayish brown  with scattered indistinct dark flecks; venter cream-color mottled with  brown on throat and chest; flanks grayish brown with cream-colored  reticulations; anal stripe distinct, creamy white, sometimes extending  outward on thighs; white spots or line below anus; vocal slits absent.    _Description._--The following description is based on USNM 115028 from  Pan de Olla, Veracruz. Adult male having a snout-vent length of 39.9  mm.; tibia length, 21.0 mm., 52.6 per cent of snout-vent length; foot  length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to  tip of longest toe), 20.5 mm.; greatest width of head, 12.8 mm., 32.1  per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 12.3 mm., 30.8 per cent of  snout-vent length. Snout short, in lateral profile bluntly rounded, in  dorsal profile rounded; canthus rounded; loreal region slightly  concave; lips thick, round, and not flaring; nostrils slightly  protuberant; internarial distance, 2.7 mm.; interorbital distance, 3.7  mm., somewhat broader than eyelid, 2.9 mm. A heavy dermal fold from  posterior corner of eye above tympanic region and then to insertion of  forearm; tympanum completely concealed. Forearm moderately robust;  distinct fold on wrist; prepollex enlarged bearing cluster of  moderate-sized, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row  of spines present on second finger; subarticular tubercles round,  small proximally and slightly larger distally; supernumerary tubercles  small and indistinct; three palmar tubercles, median and outer partly  fused; fingers long, moderately slender; discs moderately large;  length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; second and fourth  fingers subequal in length; webbing between fingers rudimentary. Heels  overlap by about one-fourth length of shank when hind limbs adpressed;  tibiotarsal articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold  thick, low, extending nearly to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle  moderately large and round; outer metatarsal tubercle small and  indistinct; subarticular tubercles small and round; supernumerary  tubercles small, present on proximal segments of digits; toes  moderately long and slender; length of toes from shortest to longest,  1-2-3-5-4; third and fifth toes subequal in length; toes about  three-fourths webbed; web extending to middle of penultimate phalanx  of fourth toe; discs rather small, about two-thirds size of those on  fingers. Anal opening directed posteroventrally at level of middle of  thighs; anal flap slightly elongate; thick, transverse dermal fold  above anus. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of limbs, except  thighs, smooth; skin of chin, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs  granular; thoracic fold present. Tongue nearly round, slightly notched  behind, and barely free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 3-3, situated on  posteroventral edges of small, transverse vomerine ridges between  rather large triangular inner nares; no vocal slits.    Color (in alcohol) of dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs dull  grayish brown with indistinct scattered darker flecks; flanks grayish  brown with cream-colored reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs  tan; chin cream-color, mottled with brown; belly creamy yellow; anal  stripe cream-color.    _Variation._--In addition to the specimen described above three others  are known. One is a juvenile having a snout-vent length of 29.5 mm.,  and two are females having snout-vent lengths of 46.9 and 41.6 mm.  Variation in structure and coloration between the four specimens is  slight. In the females the tympani are partly visible and are about  one-third the diameter of the eye; the chest is mottled with brown;  the anal stripe extends laterally in the form of a row of  cream-colored dashes and spots onto the posterodorsal surfaces of the  thighs.    _Remarks._--On the basis of the four specimens available for study,  _Hyla pachyderma_ seems to be closely related to _Hyla crassa_ and  _Hyla robertsorum_. In the _Hyla bistincta_ group, _Hyla pachyderma_  is unique in having enlarged nuptial spines.    Taylor and Smith (1945:588) stated that the frogs were found on  bushes and weeds beside a small, bounding stream near Pan de Olla.  I have searched unsuccessfully for this species in the area around  Pan de Olla and Tezuitlan.    _Distribution._--This species is known only from a stream at an  elevation of about 1600 meters on the Atlantic slopes of the Sierra  Madre Oriental in central Veracruz (Fig. 4).

The crowd was still churning around him, growing larger, and now he  heard the tramp of military feet. A small detachment of men in light  armor pushed their way through.    A very young officer whose breastplate hurt the eye with brightness  demanded to be told at once who Stark was and why he had come there.    \"No one crosses the moors in winter,\" he said, as though that in itself  were a sign of evil intent.    \"The clans of Mekh are crossing them,\" Stark answered. \"An army, to take  Kushat--one, two days behind me.\"    The crowd picked that up. Excited voices tossed it back and forth, and  clamored for more news. Stark spoke to the officer.    \"I will see your captain, and at once.\"    \"You'll see the inside of a prison, more likely!\" snapped the young man.  \"What's this nonsense about the clans of Mekh?\"    Stark regarded him. He looked so long and so curiously that the crowd  began to snicker and the officer's beardless face flushed pink to the  ears.    \"I have fought in many wars,\" said Stark gently. \"And long ago I learned  to listen, when someone came to warn me of attack.\"    \"Better take him to the captain, Lugh,\" cried Thanis. \"It's our skins  too, you know, if there is war.\"    The crowd began to shout. They were all poor folk, wrapped in threadbare  cloaks or tattered leather. They had no love for the guards. And whether  there was war or not, their winter had been long and dull, and they were  going to make the most of this excitement.    \"Take him, Lugh! Let him warn the nobles. Let them think how they'll  defend Kushat and the Gates of Death, now that the talisman is gone!\"    \"That is a lie!\" Lugh shouted. \"And you know the penalty for telling it.  Hold your tongues, or I'll have you all whipped.\" He gestured angrily at  Stark. \"See if he is armed.\"    One of the soldiers stepped forward, but Stark was quicker. He slipped  the thong and let the cloak fall, baring his upper body.    \"The clansmen have already taken everything I owned,\" he said. \"But they  gave me something, in return.\"    The crowd stared at the half healed stripes that scarred him, and there  was a drawing in of breath.    The soldier picked up the cloak and laid it over the Earthman's  shoulders. And Lugh said sullenly, \"Come, then.\"    Stark's fingers tightened on Thanis' shoulder. \"Come with me, little  one,\" he whispered. \"Otherwise, I must crawl.\"    She smiled at him and came. The crowd followed.    The captain of the guards was a fleshy man with a smell of wine about  him and a face already crumbling apart though his hair was not yet grey.  He sat in a squat tower above the square, and he observed Stark with no  particular interest.    \"You had something to tell,\" said Lugh. \"Tell it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Stark told them, leaving out all mention of Camar and the talisman. This  was neither the time nor the man to hear that story. The captain  listened to all he had to say about the gathering of the clans of Mekh,  and then sat studying him with a bleary shrewdness.    \"You have proof of all this?\"    \"These stripes. Their leader Ciaran ordered them laid on himself.\"    The captain sighed, and leaned back.    \"Any wandering band of hunters could have scourged you,\" he said. \"A  nameless vagabond from the gods know where, and a lawless one at that,  if I'm any judge of men--you probably deserved it.\"    He reached for wine, and smiled. \"Look you, stranger. In the Norlands,  no one makes war in the winter. And no one ever heard of Ciaran. If you  hoped for a reward from the city, you overshot badly.\"    \"The Lord Ciaran,\" said Stark, grimly controlling his anger, \"will be  battering at your gates within two days. And you will hear of him then.\"    \"Perhaps. You can wait for him--in a cell. And you can leave Kushat with  the first caravan after the thaw. We have enough rabble here without  taking in more.\"    Thanis caught Stark by the cloak and held him back.    \"_Sir_,\" she said, as though it were an unclean word. \"I will vouch for  the stranger.\"    The captain glanced at her. \"You?\"    \"Sir, I am a free citizen of Kushat. According to law, I may vouch for  him.\"    \"If you scum of the Thieves' Quarter would practice the law as well as  you prate it, we would have less trouble,\" growled the captain. \"Very  well, take the creature, if you want him. I don't suppose you've  anything to lose.\"    Lugh laughed.    \"Name and dwelling place,\" said the captain, and wrote them down.  \"Remember, he is not to leave the Quarter.\"    Thanis nodded. \"Come,\" she said to Stark. He did not move, and she  looked up at him. He was staring at the captain. His beard had grown in  these last days, and his face was still scarred by Thord's blows and  made wolfish with pain and fever. And now, out of this evil mask, his  eyes were peering with a chill and terrible intensity at the  soft-bellied man who sat and mocked him.    Thanis laid her hand on his rough cheek. \"Come,\" she said. \"Come and  rest.\"    Gently she turned his head. He blinked and swayed, and she took him  around the waist and led him unprotesting to the door.    There she paused, looking back.    \"Sir,\" she said, very meekly, \"news of this attack is being shouted  through the Quarter now. If it _should_ come, and it were known that you  had the warning and did not pass it on....\" She made an expressive  gesture, and went out.    Lugh glanced uneasily at the captain. \"She's right, sir. If by chance  the man did tell the truth....\"    The captain swore. \"Rot. A rogue's tale. And yet....\" He scowled  indecisively, and then reached for parchment. \"After all, it's a simple  thing. Write it up, pass it on, and let the nobles do the worrying.\"    His pen began to scratch.    Thanis took Stark by steep and narrow ways, darkling now in the  afterglow, where the city climbed and fell again over the uneven rock.  Stark was aware of the heavy smells of spices and unfamiliar foods, and  the musky undertones of a million generations swarmed together to spawn  and die in these crowded catacombs of slate and stone.    There was a house, blending into other houses, close under the loom of  the great Wall. There was a flight of steps, hollowed deep with use,  twisting crazily around outer corners.    There was a low room, and a slender man named Balin, vaguely glimpsed,  who said he was Thanis' brother. There was a bed of skins and woven  cloths.    Stark slept.           *       *       *       *       *    Hands and voices called him back. Strong hands shaking him, urgent  voices. He started up growling, like an animal suddenly awaked, still  lost in the dark mists of exhaustion. Balin swore, and caught his  fingers away.    \"What is this you have brought home, Thanis? By the gods, it snapped at  me!\"    Thanis ignored him. \"Stark,\" she said. \"Stark! Listen. Men are coming.  Soldiers. They will question you. Do you hear me?\"    Stark said heavily, \"I hear.\"    \"_Do not speak of Camar!_\"    Stark got to his feet, and Balin said hastily, \"Peace! The thing is  safe. I would not steal a death warrant!\"    His voice had a ring of truth. Stark sat down again. It was an effort to  keep awake. There was clamor in the street below. It was still night.    Balin said carefully, \"Tell them what you told the captain, nothing  more. They will kill you if they know.\"    A rough hand thundered at the door, and a voice cried, \"Open up!\"    Balin sauntered over to lift the bar. Thanis sat beside Stark, her hand  touching his. Stark rubbed his face. He had been shaved and washed, his  wounds rubbed with salve. The belt was gone, and his blood-stained  clothing. He realized only then that he was naked, and drew a cloth  around him. Thanis whispered, \"The belt is there on that peg, under your  cloak.\"    Balin opened the door, and the room was full of men.    Stark recognized the captain. There were others, four of them, young,  old, intermediate, annoyed at being hauled away from their beds and  their gaming tables at this hour. The sixth man wore the jewelled  cuirass of a noble. He had a nice, a kind face. Grey hair, mild eyes,  soft cheeks. A fine man, but ludicrous in the trappings of a soldier.    \"Is this the man?\" he asked, and the captain nodded.    \"Yes.\" It was his turn to say Sir.    Balin brought a chair. He had a fine flourish about him. He wore a  crimson jewel in his left ear, and every line of him was quick and  sensitive, instinct with mockery. His eyes were brightly cynical, in a  face worn lean with years of merry sinning. Stark liked him.    He was a civilized man. They all were--the noble, the captain, the lot  of them. So civilized that the origins of their culture were forgotten  half an age before the first clay brick was laid in Babylon.    Too civilized, Stark thought. Peace had drawn their fangs and cut their  claws. He thought of the wild clansmen coming fast across the snow, and  felt a certain pity for the men of Kushat.    The noble sat down.    \"This is a strange tale you bring, wanderer. I would hear it from your  own lips.\"    Stark told it. He spoke slowly, watching every word, cursing the  weariness that fogged his brain.    The noble, who was called Rogain, asked him questions. Where was the  camp? How many men? What were the exact words of the Lord Ciaran, and  who was he?    Stark answered, with meticulous care.    Rogain sat for some time lost in thought. He seemed worried and upset,  one hand playing aimlessly with the hilt of his sword. A scholar's hand,  without a callous on it.    \"There is one thing more,\" said Rogain. \"What business had you on the  moors in winter?\"    Stark smiled. \"I am a wanderer by profession.\"    \"Outlaw?\" asked the captain, and Stark shrugged.    \"Mercenary is a kinder word.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Rogain studied the pattern of stripes on the Earthman's dark skin. \"Why  did the Lord Ciaran, so-called, order you scourged?\"    \"I had thrashed one of his "]]]
