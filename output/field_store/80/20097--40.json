The day of famine was at least  procrastinated by the supply of flour and salt provisions she brought us.    The 'Sirius' had made her passage to the Cape of Good Hope, by the route of  Cape Horn, in exactly thirteen weeks. Her highest latitude was 57 degrees  10 minutes south, where the weather proved intolerably cold. Ice, in great  quantity, was seen for many days; and in the middle of December (which is  correspondent to the middle of June, in our hemisphere), water froze in  open casks upon deck, in the moderate latitude of 44 degrees.    They were very kindly treated by the Dutch governor, and amply supplied by  the merchants at the Cape, where they remained seven weeks. Their passage  back was effected by Van Diemen's Land, near which, and close under  Tasman's Head, they were in the utmost peril of being wrecked.    In this long run, which had extended round the circle, they had always  determined their longitude, to the greatest nicety, by distances taken  between the sun and moon, or between the moon and a star. But it falls  to the lot of very few ships to possess such indefatigable and accurate  observers as Captain Hunter, and Mr. (now Captain) Bradley, the first  lieutenant of the 'Sirius'.    I feel assured, that I have no reader who will not join in regretting the  premature loss of Arabanoo, who died of the smallpox on the 18th instant,  after languishing in it six days. From some imperfect marks and indents  on his face, we were inclined to believe that he had passed this dreaded  disorder. Even when the first symptoms of sickness seized him, we continued  willing to hope that they proceeded from a different cause. But at length  the disease burst forth with irresistible fury. It were superfluous to say,  that nothing which medical skill and unremitting attention could perform,  were left unexerted to mitigate his sufferings, and prolong a life,  which humanity and affectionate concern towards his sick compatriots,  unfortunately shortened.    During his sickness he reposed entire confidence in us. Although a stranger  to medicine, and nauseating the taste of it, he swallowed with patient  submission innumerable drugs,* which the hope of relief induced us to  administer to him. The governor, who particularly regarded him, caused him  to be buried in his own garden, and attended the funeral in person.    [*Very different had been his conduct on a former occasion of a similar  kind. Soon after he was brought among us he was seized with a diarrhoea,  for which he could by no persuasion be induced to swallow any of our  prescriptions. After many ineffectual trials to deceive, or overcome him,  it was at length determined to let him pursue his own course, and to watch  if he should apply for relief to any of the productions of the country. He  was in consequence observed to dig fern-root, and to chew it. Whether the  disorder had passed its crisis, or whether the fern-root effected a cure, I  know not; but it is certain that he became speedily well.    **The regard was reciprocal. His excellency had been ill but a short time  before, when Arabanoo had testified the utmost solicitude for his case and  recovery. It is probable that he acquired, on this occasion, just notions  of the benefit to be derived from medical assistance. A doctor is, among  them, a person of consequence. It is certain that he latterly estimated our  professional gentlemen very highly.]    The character of Arabanoo, as far as we had developed it, was distinguished  by a portion of gravity and steadiness, which our subsequent acquaintance  with his countrymen by no means led us to conclude a national  characteristic. In that daring, enterprising frame of mind, which, when  combined with genius, constitutes the leader of a horde of savages, or the  ruler of a people, boasting the power of discrimination and the resistance  of ambition, he was certainly surpassed by some of his successors,  who afterwards lived among us. His countenance was thoughtful, but not  animated: his fidelity and gratitude, particularly to his friend the  governor, were constant and undeviating, and deserve to be recorded.  Although of a gentle and placable temper, we early discovered that he was  impatient of indignity, and allowed of no superiority on our part. He knew  that he was in our power; but the independence of his mind never forsook  him. If the slightest insult were offered to him, he would return it with  interest. At retaliation of merriment he was often happy; and frequently  turned the laugh against his antagonist. He did not want docility;  but either from the difficulty of acquiring our language, from the  unskillfulness of his teachers, or from some natural defect, his progress  in learning it was not equal to what we had expected. For the last three  or four weeks of his life, hardly any restraint was laid upon his  inclinations: so that had he meditated escape, he might easily have  effected it. He was, perhaps, the only native who was ever attached to us  from choice; and who did not prefer a precarious subsistence among wilds  and precipices, to the comforts of a civilized system.    By his death, the scheme which had invited his capture was utterly  defeated. Of five natives who had been brought among us, three had perished  from a cause which, though unavoidable, it was impossible to explain to a  people, who would condescend to enter into no intercourse with us. The same  suspicious dread of our approach, and the same scenes of vengeance acted on  unfortunate stragglers, continued to prevail.          CHAPTER V.        Transactions of the Colony until the Close of the Year 1789.      The anniversary of his majesty's birth-day was celebrated, as heretofore,  at the government-house, with loyal festivity. In the evening, the play of  'The Recruiting Officer' was performed by a party of convicts, and honoured  by the presence of his excellency, and the officers of the garrison.  That every opportunity of escape from the dreariness and dejection of  our situation should be eagerly embraced, will not be wondered at. The  exhilarating effect of a splendid theatre is well known: and I am not  ashamed to confess, that the proper distribution of three or four yards of  stained paper, and a dozen farthing candles stuck around the mud walls of a  convict-hut, failed not to diffuse general complacency on the countenances  of sixty persons, of various descriptions, who were assembled to applaud  the representation. Some of the actors acquitted themselves with great  spirit, and received the praises of the audience: a prologue and an  epilogue, written by one of the performers, were also spoken on the  occasion; which, although not worth inserting here, contained some  tolerable allusions to the situation of the parties, and the novelty of a  stage-representation in New South Wales.    Broken Bay, which was supposed to be completely explored, became again an  object of research. On the sixth instant, the governor, accompanied by a  large party in two boats, proceeded thither. Here they again wandered over  piles of mis-shapen desolation, contemplating scenes of wild solitude,  whose unvarying appearance renders them incapable of affording either  novelty or gratification. But when they had given over the hope of  farther discovery, by pursuing the windings of an inlet, which, from  its appearance, was supposed to be a short creek, they suddenly found  themselves at the entrance of a fresh water river, up which they proceeded  twenty miles, in a westerly direction; and would have farther prosecuted  their research, had not a failure of provisions obliged them to return.  This river they described to be of considerable breadth, and of great  depth; but its banks had hitherto presented nothing better than a  counterpart of the rocks and precipices which surround Broken Bay.    June, 1789. A second expedition, to ascertain its course, was undertaken  by his excellency, who now penetrated (measuring by the bed of the river)  between 60 and 70 miles, when the farther progress of the boats was stopped  by a fall. The water in every part was found to be fresh and good. Of the  adjoining country, the opinions of those who had inspected it (of which  number I was not) were so various, that I shall decline to record them.  Some saw a rich and beautiful country; and others were so unfortunate as to  discover little else than large tracts of low land, covered with reeds, and  rank with the inundations of the stream, by which they had been recently  covered. All parties, however, agreed, that the rocky, impenetrable  country, seen on the first excursion, had ended nearly about the place  whence the boats had then turned back. Close to the fall stands a very  beautiful hill, which our adventurers mounted, and enjoyed from it an  extensive prospect. Potatoes, maize, and garden seeds of various kinds  were put into the earth, by the governor's order, on different parts  of Richmond-hill, which was announced to be its name. The latitude of  Richmond-hill, as observed by captain Hunter, was settled at 33 degrees 36  minutes south.    Here also the river received the name of Hawkesbury, in honour of the noble  lord who bears that title.    Natives were found on the banks in several parts, many of whom were  labouring under the smallpox. They did not attempt to commit hostilities  against the boats; but on the contrary shewed every sign of welcome and  friendship to the strangers.    At this period, I was unluckily invested with the command of the outpost at  Rose Hill, which prevented me from being in the list of discoverers of  the Hawkesbury.

It seems to result immediately from his character, and to be an  inseparable part of it. It is free from all the commonplaces of fine  writing; has nothing of the formal contrivance of the rhetorician, the  balanced period, the pointed turn, the recurring cadence. Yet the charms  of a genuine simplicity, of a directness almost quaint, of primitive  gravity, and calm, native good sense, renders it singularly agreeable to  a cultivated taste. Undoubtedly there is in spiritual sensibility  something akin to genius, and like it tending to utterance in language  significant and beautiful. We meet at times in Dr. Hooker's writings  with phrases of the rarest felicity and of great delicacy and  expressiveness; in which we know not whether most to admire the vigor  which has conceived so striking a thought, or the refinement of art  which has fixed it in words so beautifully exact.          SUNSET.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.    BY R. S. CHILTON          See with what pomp the golden sun goes down      Behind yon purple mountain!--far and wide      His mellow radiance streams; the steep hill-side      Is clothed with splendor, and the distant town      Wears his last glory like a blazing crown.      We cannot see him now, and yet his fire      Still lingers on the city's tallest spire,--      Chased slowly upward by the gathering frown      Of the approaching darkness. God of light!      Thou leavest us in gloom,--but other eyes      Watch thy faint coming now in distant skies:--      There drooping flowers spring up, and streams grow bright,      And singing birds plume their moist wings for flight,      And stars grow pale and vanish from the sight!          NEW-YORK SOCIETY, BY THE LAST ENGLISH TRAVELLER.      The Hon. HENRY COPE has lately published in London a _Ride across the  Rocky Mountains, to California_--a book abounding in striking adventure  and description, and illustrating in its general tone the spirit of an  English gentleman. Its temper and good sense may be inferred from the  following specimen, on the never-failing subject of Society in New-York:         \"Any observations I might be tempted to make on New-York, or       even, I am inclined to think, on any of the civilized parts       of the states, would probably be neither novel nor       interesting. I am not ambitious of circulating more       'American notes,' nor do I care to follow in the footsteps       of Mrs. Trollope. Enough has been written to illustrate the       singularities of second-rate American society. Good society       is the same all over the world. General remarks I hold to be       fair play. But to indulge in personalities is a poor return       for hospitality; and those Americans who are most willing to       be civil to foreigners, receive little enough encouragement       to extend that civility, when, as is too often the case,       those very foreigners afterwards attempt to amuse their       friends on one side of the Atlantic, at the expense of a       breach of good faith to their friends on the other. Every       one has his prejudices: I freely confess I have mine. I like       London better than New-York, but it does not, therefore,       follow that I dislike New-York, or Americans either. I have       a great respect for almost every thing American--I do not       mean to say that I have any affection for a thorough bred       Yankee, in our acceptation of the term; far from it, I think       him the most offensive of all bipeds in the known world.       Yankee snobs too I hate--such as infest Broadway, for       instance, genuine specimens of the genus, according to the       highest authorities. The worst of New-York is its       superabundance of snobbism. The snob here is a snob \"_sui       generis_\" quite beyond the capacities of the old world.       There is no mistaking him. He is cut out after the most       approved pattern. If he differs from the original, or       whatever that might have been, it must be in a surpassing       excellence of snobbism which does credit to the progressive       order of things. Tuft-hunting is a sport he pursues with       delight to himself, but without remorse or pity for his       victim. It is necessary for the object of his persecutions       to be constantly on the alert. He is frequently seen       prowling about in white kid gloves, patent leather boots,       and Parisian hat. Whenever this is the case, he must be       considered dangerous and bloody-minded, for in all       probability he is meditating a call. Often he has been known       to run his prey to ground in the Opera or other public       places, and there to worry them within less than an inch of       their good temper. Offensive as he is, generally speaking,       he sometimes acts on the defensive; for, not very well       convinced of his own infallibility, he is particularly       susceptible of affronts, to which his assumed consequence       not unfrequently makes him liable. Baits are often proffered       by these swell-catchers to lure the unwary. Such as an       introduction to the nymphs of the _corps de ballet_; the       _entre_ to all the theatres, private gambling-houses, &c.,       &c. But beware of such seductions.\"          EMILIE DE COIGNY.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.    BY RICHARD B. KIMBALL.    [Illustration: EMILIE DE COIGNY AND THE STUDENTS.]      A morning at _La Morgue_ is hardly as agreeable as a day at the Louvre,  yet it is not without a certain fascination. Let but the influence once  fasten on you, and it will be very hard to shake it off. At one period I  confess it was to me almost irresistible, and I shudder sometimes when I  recollect how punctually every morning at the same hour I took my place  on one side of that fearful room--not for the purpose of inspecting the  bodies of the suicides (I rarely turned to look at them), but to regard  the countenances of the anxious ones who came to realize the worst, or  to take hope till the morrow. Literally there are no spectators in that  dismal solitude--if we except an occasional visit from the foreign  sight-hunter, who comes in charge of a valet, and passes in and out and  away to the \"next place.\" In London or in New-York, an establishment so  public would be thronged with persons eager to gratify a prurient  curiosity. Not so in Paris. The French possess a sensibility so  refined--it may be called a species of delicacy--that they cannot enjoy  such a spectacle, can scarcely endure it: and if the tourist will bring  the subject to mind, he will recollect that while his guide pointed out  the entrance, he himself declined going into the apartment.    I know not how it happened, but, as I have remarked, the habit of  visiting this spot every morning, was fastened on me. Never shall I  forget some of the faces I encountered there. One image is impressed on  me indelibly; it is that of a woman of middle age, with a very pale  face, and having the appearance of one struggling with some wearing  sorrow, who for two weeks in succession came in daily, and walking  painfully up to the partition, looked intently through the lattice work,  and turned and went away. I never before felt so strong an impulse to  accost a person, without yielding to it. Indeed I had resolved to speak  to her on the morning of the fifteenth day, but she did not come and I  never saw her again. Who was she? did her fears prove groundless? what  became of her? An old man I remember to have seen--a very old man,  feeble and decrepit, who came once only, looked at the dead, shook his  head despairingly, and tottered away: I know not if he discovered the  object of his search. Young girls who had quarrelled with their lovers,  and lovers who in moments of jealousy had been cruel to their  sweethearts, would look anxiously in, and generally with relieved  spirits pass out, almost smilingly, resolving no doubt to make all up  before night should again tempt to suicide. Another incident I cannot  omit, although it is impossible to recall it without a dreadful pang.  One morning a pretty fair-haired child, not more than four years old,  came running in, and clasping the wooden bar with one hand, pointed with  her little finger through the opening, and with a tone of innocent  curiosity said, \"There's mamma!\" The same moment two or three rushed in,  and seizing the unconscious orphan, carried her hastily away. She had  wandered after some of the family, and heard enough as they came from  the fatal place to lead her to suppose her lost mamma was there, and so  she ran to see. What could be the circumstances so untoward, that even  the child could not bind the mother to life?    A long chapter might be written of the occurrences at my singular  rendezvous, but I had no design, when I began, of alluding to them, and  I will only remark here that, leaving Paris some time after for the  south of Europe, I got rid of this nightmare impulse, and although I  returned the following season I never again entered _La Morgue_....    It was in the spring when I came back. The foliage was deep and green,  and in the _Jardin des Plants_, which was near my quarters, the various  flowers and shrubs and trees filled the atmosphere with fragrance, and  tempted us to frequent strolls along its avenues.    \"Come with me at six o'clock,\" said my friend Partridge, \"and you shall  see an apparition.\"    \"Where?\"    \"I will not tell you, till we are on the Spot.\"    \"I will go, but hope the rendezvous will be an agreeable one.\" Just  then, I know not why, I thought of _La Morgue_, and shuddered.    \"The most agreeable in all Paris.\"    This conversation took place in the Hospital _de Notre Dame de Pitie_,  just as we were finishing our morning occupation of following the  celebrated LOUIS through the fever wards. Partridge was my room-mate,  and generally a fellow traveller, but I had left him behind in"]]]
