This assumes a level road. If, however, there are hills to climb and  the body weight and the pack are lifted 1000 feet during the hike, this  is done at the additional expense of approximately 0.96 calory of energy  per pound of weight lifted. If the man weighed 156 pounds and the pack  44 pounds, the additional fuel requirement would be 192 calories (200 x  0.96). The total energy requirement for this kind of a hike would have  been 4200 calories. Walking down hill is accomplished at an expenditure  of slightly less energy than walking on the level, but this factor need  not concern one.    Supposing, however, this individual were running, lightly clad, on a  level road in a race for a distance of 40 miles at the rate of 5.3 miles  per hour, he would complete the distance in seven hours and thirty-three  minutes, which is a reasonable record. His metabolism might thus be  calculated:                                                               Calories      Sleeping 10 hours at 70 calories per hour                   700    Resting 6 hours, 23 minutes, at 77 calories per hour        497    Running 7 hours, 33 minutes, at 561 calories per hour      4236                                                               ----                                                               5433    It is a matter of record that a man has run between Milwaukee and  Chicago, a distance of 80 miles, in about fifteen hours. Such an amount  of work would have required over 9000 calories for the day.    These calculations are all based upon experimental results obtained in  various laboratories in different parts of the world and can be accepted  as being free from any gross error.    It is evident that the energy requirement is proportional to the amount  of mechanical energy expended.    One may turn now to the fuel needs in terms of calories in certain  industrial pursuits. According to Becker and Hamalainen, the quantity of  extra metabolism per hour required in various pursuits is as follows:                                         Extra calories of                                        metabolism per                                         hour due to                                         occupation      Occupations of women:      Seamstress                              6      Typist[5]                              24      Seamstress using sewing machine      24-57      Bookbinder                           38-63      Housemaid                            81-157      Washerwoman                         124-214      Occupations of men:      Tailor                                 44      Bookbinder                             81      Shoemaker                              90      Carpenter                           116-164      Metal worker                          141      Painter (of furniture)                145      Stonemason                            300      Man sawing wood                       378    [5] Observation of Carpenter.    To use this table one may seek the basal metabolism of the individual,  add 10 per cent. for sixteen hours of wakefulness when the person is  sitting or standing, and then multiply the factors in the last table by  the numbers of hours of work. For example, if one takes the individual  weighing 156 pounds, one obtains the following requirements of energy if  his business were that of a tailor and he worked eight hours a day:                                                       Calories      Sleeping 8 hours at 70 calories per hour           560    Awake 16 hours at 77 calories per hour            1232    Add for work as tailor 8 hours at 44 calories      352                                                      ----                                                      2144    After this fashion one might calculate his food requirements had he  followed occupations other than that of tailor:                        Calories of                      metabolism    Occupation          per day      Bookbinder           2440    Shoemaker            2510    Carpenter            3100    Metal worker         2900    Painter              2950    Stonemason           4200    Man sawing wood      4800    These figures make no allowance for walking to or from the place of  employment.    The data here given are inadequate to cover the industrial situation,  but they show clearly that heavy work cannot be accomplished without a  sufficient amount of food-fuel.    The food-fuel with which to accomplish work is necessary not only for  the soldier, but for the workman behind the line, and it should be  adequate in quantity, satisfactory in quality, and not exorbitant in  cost.    In virtue of the world-wide scarcity of food, the work of the individual  should be worthy of the food which he eats.    Tables showing the cost of various wholesome food-stuffs about July 1,  1917, are here reproduced for the benefit of the reader. The tables were  prepared by Dr. F. C. Gephart and issued by the Department of Health of  the City of New York in a leaflet edited by Doctors Holt, La Fetra,  Pisek, and Lusk on the subject of food for children. If the world is  seeking after energy in the form of food-fuel, the world is rightly  entitled to understand the value of its purchases. It must be clearly  understood that people are always destined to look with hopeful  anticipation toward the enjoyment of a meal. They will instinctively  \"eat calories\" just as they instinctively \"eat pounds.\" They _buy  pounds_ of food, and they could buy more intelligently if they knew the  energy value of what they buy.

Males have been observed  calling from grasses, bushes, and emergent vegetation near temporary  ponds and ditches along roads. William E. Duellman informed me that he  found a breeding congregation of this species in June near Chepo,  Panama, where males were calling from spiny palms at the edge of a  woodland pond. Fouquette (1958) found calling males in May, August,  and September near Miraflores Locks, Canal Zone. Calling stations vary  from one to two meters above ground. No clasping pairs have been  found; only one female is known (KU 101589, from 8 km NE Tocumen,  Panama); this gravid individual was collected in early June.    The mating call of _Hyla foliamorta_ consists of one pulsed,  low-pitched, moderate trill of about O.5 second duration. Each note is  repeated at intervals of 5 seconds to a few minutes. The notes have  about 50 pulses per second, a fundamental frequency of 56 cycles per  second and a dominant frequency of about 3000 cycles per second (Table  2, Pl. 3B).    Egg deposition sites are unknown. No information is available  concerning early development, and little is known about the breeding  season of _Hyla foliamorta_. Probably its breeding activities are  restricted to the rainy months.    _Tadpoles._--Eight tadpoles were collected from a weedy temporary pond  near Chepo, Panama, in early June.    A typical tadpole in stage 35 of development (KU 104244) has a body  length of 9.5 mm., tail length of 25.0 mm., and a total length of 34.5  mm. Other characters are as follows: depth of tail equal to length of  body; body deeper than wide; distance between eye and nostril equal to  distance between eye and spiracle; mouth anteroventral; median part of  upper lip bare; rest of lip having one row of papillae; a few other  rows of small papillae at corners of mouth; tooth rows 2/3; first  upper row entire, second upper row interrupted medially, shorter than  first; lower rows shorter than upper rows, third shortest; beak  moderately robust; spiracle nearer eye than anus; anal tube short,  aperture not extending to border of ventral fin; caudal musculature  slender, extending to tip of pointed tail; dorsal fin extending onto  body (Table 4).

In  preservative body creamy white, transparent below with dark pigment  above in some specimens.    _Remarks._--_Hyla foliamorta_ can be confused only with _Hyla  boulengeri_. The differences between adults of these species were  discussed in _Remarks_ on _H. boulengeri_. The tadpoles of  _foliamorta_ have labial papillae on the lower lip and a stripe  between the eye and the tip of the snout. By comparison the tadpoles  of _boulengeri_ have a bare lower lip and no stripe between the eye  and the tip of the snout.    _Distribution._--_Hyla foliamorta_ inhabits the subhumid Pacific  lowlands (elevations of less than 100 meters) of Central Panama and  Caribbean lowlands of northern Colombia (Fig. 4).    _Specimens Examined._--Panama: _Panama_: 3 km WSW Chepo, KU 77164-9,  101573-5, 104243-4 (tadpoles); 6 km WSW Chepo, KU 77170, 101576-8; 1.5  km SW Naranjal, KU 77171, 77687 (skeleton); 2 km N Tocumen, KU  101579-83, 104349 (skeleton); 8 km NE Tocumen, KU 101584-92.

In preservative, dorsum pale brown with darker dorsolateral stripes;  narrow dark brown line from nostril to eye; groin, anterior surface of  thighs, and posteroventral surfaces of shanks creamy tan with dark  brown vermiculations; white spots present on thighs in some specimens;  throat flecked with brown; belly creamy white or gray.    _Remarks._--The taxonomic history of _Hyla rubra_ Laurenti is  confused. Seba (1734:70) illustrated and diagnosed a frog for which  he used the name _Ranula, Americana, Rubra_. Linnaeus (1758:213)  considered Seba's frog to be a variety of _Hyla arborea_. Laurenti  (1768:35) apparently examined the same individual that Seba called  _Ranula, Americana, Rubra_. For this specimen, Laurenti used the  binominal _Hyla rubra_ and provided a brief diagnosis. The type  locality was given as America.    Daudin (1802:26) redescribed the same specimen(s?) treated by Seba and  Laurenti and provided a fairly good description and figures. Daudin  restricted the type locality to Surinam and indicated that Marin de  Baize was the probable collector. Daudin (1802:26 and 1803:53)  neglected to consider Laurenti's work, but he applied the same name  used by Laurenti. Most authors have credited _Hyla rubra_ to Daudin,  but Rivero (1961:120) noted that _Hyla rubra_ Laurenti, 1768, has  priority over _Hyla rubra_ Daudin, 1802. Since both Laurenti and  Daudin worked on Seba's material, it is reasonable to assume that  Daudin redescribed the same frog that was named by Laurenti; this was  not an uncommon practice in the early nineteenth century. Thus I  conclude that _Hyla rubra_ Daudin, 1802, is a junior synonym of _Hyla  rubra_ Laurenti, 1768.    Dunn (1931a:413) first reported _Hyla rubra_ from Central America; he  recorded the species from the Canal Zone and San Pablo, Panama. I have  examined the material of _Hyla rubra_ from Panama deposited in various  museums. Most of the specimens are faded, discolored, and do not have  distinct brown vermiculations on the thighs. The specimens seem to be  more like _Hyla rubra_ than any of the other species in the _rubra_  group. The presence of oval choanae and a tympanum larger than the  largest finger disc separate these specimens from _Hyla elaeochroa_, a  species with which _rubra_ has been confused. _Hyla elaeochroa_ does  not occur in the Canal Zone or eastern Panama. All museum specimens  from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and western Panama that have been called  _Hyla rubra_, plus those mentioned by Dunn and Emlen (1932:25) and  Dunn (1933:61) are _Hyla elaeochroa_.    The taxonomic status of the many South American populations referred  to _Hyla rubra_ and of other populations now recognized as different  species is not clear at the present time. Considerable variation in  external characters and in cranial features has been observed in South  American _rubra_. A review of the taxonomy of these populations is  beyond the scope of this paper. Possibly the Central American  specimens herein referred to _rubra_ will ultimately be found to be  specifically distinct from those in Surinam. Since I have no  osteological material from Central America, I have been unable to  describe the cranium in this account. Furthermore, I have no data on  the ecology and life history of _rubra_ in Central America.    _Distribution._--_Hyla rubra_ inhabits lowland tropical forests from  central-eastern Panama to northern South America and thence through  lowlands east of the Andes to northern Argentina (Fig. 6).    _Specimens Examined._--Panama: _Canal Zone_: Gatun, UMMZ 52720 (2);  Madden Dam, FMNH 67820; no specific locality, UMMZ 56517 (3), USNM  37863. _Colon_: Cerro Bruja, MCZ 13248. _Darien_: El Real, USNM  140569-70, 140573. _Panama_: Juan Diaz, MCZ 17973; Las Sabanas, MCZ  17581; Rio"]]]
