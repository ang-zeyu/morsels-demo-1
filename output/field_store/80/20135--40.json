She was known to have  visited the remains of at least four deer and three moose, and she  stayed near one moose carcass from February 8 to 20, at least during  the day. Between her date of capture, December 10, and February 28,  1053 traveled about in an area of 31 square miles in the Arrow  Lake-Maniwaki Lake region (fig. 21).    [Illustration: _Figure 21.--Locations and range of wolf 1053. Only  selected lakes are shown._]    Between February 28 and March 6 she suddenly moved 13 miles to the  east-southeast near the Sawbill Trail, and during the next week she  traveled a straight line distance of 24 miles southwest to a point  southeast of the town of Isabella. Her subsequent travels eventually  took her over a much larger area. Before February 28, 1053's average  weekly straight line distance was 2 miles, but after that date it  increased to 11 miles.    _Wolf 1055._--The range of this animal from January 5, when she was  captured, to February 23 covered about 40 square miles near Stony Lake,  Slate Lake, and the Jack Pine Lookout Tower (fig. 22), and her mean  weekly distance was 4 miles. Between February 23 and 24, however, she  traveled 13 miles northeastward, the beginning of a series of long  moves. By March 5, 1055 had reached Crescent Lake, a point 39 miles  east-northeast of her previous area of intensive use. She then  gradually headed back toward the west and south during the next 10 days  and within the next month repeated this pattern. When her signal was  heard last on May 30, 1055 was near Martin Landing in the center of her  range. Her mean net weekly distance after February 23 had increased to  22 miles.    [Illustration: _Figure 22.--Locations and range of wolf 1055. Only  selected lakes are shown._]    _Wolf 1057._--The movements of 1057 cannot be considered normal  because freezing of a front foot prevented her accompanying the pack of  which she was a member. Nevertheless, even data from an abnormal animal  can provide some information. On January 13, 5 days after capture and  release on Red Rock Lake, 1057 was located 4 miles from the capture  point with a pack of 10 other wolves. She was limping and fell behind  when they moved. Five days later she was again seen with the pack 12  miles away between Knife Lake and Kekekabic Lake. She then remained in  about 14 square miles of that general area through April 17 (fig. 23).    [Illustration: _Figure 23.--Locations and range of wolf 1057. Only  selected lakes are shown._]    Suddenly on April 24, 1057 was found in Ontario some 31 miles northeast  of her location of the previous week. That was the last time we heard  her signal even though on May 2 we scanned an area with a radius of 35  miles from her last known location and listened for her signal during  every subsequent flight.    _Wolf 1059._--This animal was a member of a pack of three to five  wolves (see next section). The movements of the group varied little and  were concentrated in the August Lake, Omaday Lake, and Keeley Creek  area in about 43 square miles (fig. 24). Contrary to animals 1051,  1053, and 1055, this pack did not suddenly begin a series of longer  weekly movements in late February. Both before and after February 28,  the average weekly straight line movement of the pack was just less  than 3 miles.    [Illustration: _Figure 24.--Location and range of wolf 1059 and pack.  Only selected lakes are shown._]    Probably these animals did begin traveling more in late February, for  their net daily distances did increase at that time along with those of  the other wolves (table 4). However, the increased travel took place  within the restricted area of the pack's usual range rather than in new  areas as occurred with the other wolves.    Because 1059 was later found to have bred and carried five fetuses, her  movements during whelping season (late April and early May) are of  interest. Her locations on both April 24 and May 2 were within 250  yards of each other, which might indicate that she was denning. On May  9, however, she was 2.5 miles east of these locations, on the 17th and  21st was 2 miles west of them, and on the 30th was 3 miles north of  them.    In early January 1970, Wolf 1059 was killed by a trapper in the  southeast corner of her pack's 1969 range.    _Summer locations._--Signals from only 1053 and 1059 were heard during  summer, and then tracking attempts were made only on June 28, July 29,  and August 29. Locations for 1053 on those occasions were near Kelly  Landing and Isabella Lake, within her previous range. Wolf 1059 was  found each time within 2 miles outside of the southwest corner of the  pack's winter and spring range.      Wolf Associations, Social Behavior, and Reproduction    In our study area, population units of wolves exist as both single  animals (lone wolves) and packs. In a total of 77 observations, lone  wolves constituted 32 percent of the sightings (fig. 25), with packs of  from 2 to 13 members making up the remainder (Table 1). On the basis of  the number of wolves seen, rather than the number of observations,  lone wolves accounted for only 25 (8 percent) out of 323.    [Illustration: _Figure 25.--Only 8 percent of the wolves observed were  lone wolves. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Frenzel.)_]    These figures compare favorably with reports in the literature as  summarized by Mech (1970). In five areas studied, lone wolves made up  from 24 to 60 percent of the observations of population units, and from  8 to 28 percent of the wolves seen. In our study area during 1948 to  1953, lone wolves constituted 43 percent of the observations and 15  percent of the wolves (Stenlund 1955).    The average size of the population units observed during our study  (total number of wolves seen divided by the number of observations) was  4.2, which is significantly larger (95 percent level) than the average  seen in this area (2.8) from 1948 to 1953. This is also larger than  that reported from any other area of comparable size (table 6).      _Table 6.--Mean sizes of wolf population units reported from various  areas_    ---------+------------+--------+------------+---------+---------------           |            |        |Mean size of| Largest |   Authority    Area   |Observations| Wolves | population |pack size|calculated from           |            |        |    unit    |         |  ---------+------------+--------+------------+---------+---------------              _Number_   _Number_    Alaska         310      1,041        3.4         12    Kelly 1954  Alaska       1,268      4,823        3.8         21    R.

A. Rausch. Personal correspondence to L. D. Mech, 1967.      The largest pack seen in our study area included 13 members, and there  apparently were at least two such packs. Although larger packs than  this have been reported, any group containing more than 8 to 10 members  is unusually large (Mech 1970).    Wolf sociology is a complex subject and is still not well understood,  so the following detailed observations of the associations between our  radiotagged wolves and others are given. Associations are defined as  relationships in which two or more wolves relate in a close, positive  manner.    As mentioned earlier, 1051 may or may not have been associated with  other wolves when he was captured. However, although this animal was  observed 55 times throughout winter and spring, only twice was he seen  associating with another wolf. Probably the same individual was  involved each time, because the location was about the same (the  vicinity of the juncture of Aitkin, Carlton, and St. Louis Counties).    The first occasion was on April 3. Wolf 1051 in the previous week had  moved 46 miles straight line distance from the northeast. He was then  observed lying peacefully within 15 feet of another wolf near a freshly  killed deer. The very proximity of the two animals implied a positive  relationship. On April 7, 10 and 14, 1051 was seen 1 mile, 10 miles,  and 8 miles from the kill and was alone each time.    However, on April 17, 1051 was back in the general vicinity of the  kill, and he and another wolf were resting on an open hillside about  100 feet from each other. As we descended for a closer look, the  smaller animal arose and headed to the larger, presumably 1051 because  he had not been disturbed by the aircraft. The larger wolf did not  arise for several seconds, but eventually followed the other into the  woods. No tail raising or other expressive posturing was seen in either  wolf. One week later 1051 was 26 miles northwest of the kill traveling  alone.    Wolf 1053 was never seen less than 80 yards from another wolf, and  there was no evidence that she ever associated with a conspecific. Even  when she was seen 80 yards from the other wolf, both were resting, and  when the strange wolf left, 1053 made no attempt to accompany or follow  it.    No. 1055 apparently had been traveling with another wolf when caught on  January 5, and tracks showed that the individual had remained near her  until we arrived to handle her. Tracks found on January 7 and 10  suggested that 1055 was with another animal, but that animal was not  seen during any of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37599"],[0,"The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the land of Flanders (#5)"],[1," sitting there  whole hours together, with his legs stretched out in front of him,  hoping that some valet or other might trip over them by mistake; then  he would have the fellow flogged; for he took pleasure in listening  to his cries under the lash. But he never laughed.    Another day he would select some other corridor in which to lay a  similar trap, and once again he would sit himself down with his legs  stretched out in front of him. Then one of the Ladies of the Court,  mayhap, or one of the Lords or pages, would stumble across him;  and if they fell down and hurt themselves, he took delight in their  discomfiture. But he never laughed. And if by chance any one knocked  against him but did not fall down, he would cry out as if he had been  struck. He liked to see the other's fright. But he never laughed.    His Sacred Majesty was informed of these goings-on, and he commanded  that no notice should be taken of the child, saying that if his son  did not want people to walk over his legs he should not place his  legs in a position where they were liable to be walked over. Philip  was angry at this, but he said nothing and was no more seen, till  one fine summer day when he went out into the courtyard to warm his  shivering body in the sun.    Charles, riding back from the war, saw his son thus brewing his  melancholy.    \"How now?\" cried the Emperor. \"What a difference there is between us  two, my son! At your age I loved nothing better than to go climbing  trees after squirrels. Or, with the aid of a rope, to clamber down some  steep cliff to take young eagles out of their nests. I might easily  have broken my bones at the game; but they only grew the harder. And  when I went out hunting, the deer fled into the thickets at sight of  me, armed with my trusty arquebus.\"    \"Ah, my Lord Father,\" sighed the child, \"but you see, I have the  stomach-ache.\"    \"For that,\" said Charles, \"good wine from Paxarete is a most certain  remedy.\"    \"I don't like wine. I have a headache, my Lord Father.\"    \"Then you should run and jump and play about like other children of  your age.\"    \"I have stiff legs, my Lord Father.\"    \"And how should it be otherwise,\" said Charles, \"seeing that you  make no more use of them than if they were of wood? But you shall  go riding on a high-mettled horse.\"    The child began to cry.    \"Oh no, for mercy's sake! I have a pain in my back!\"    \"Come, come,\" said Charles, \"are you ill everywhere then?\"    \"I should not be ill at all,\" answered the child, \"if only they would  let me alone.\"    \"Do you think to pass your royal life away in dreams like a  scholar?\" the Emperor asked impatiently. \"Such people as that, if  indeed it be necessary for the inking of their parchments, may rightly  seek out silence, solitude, retirement from the world. But for thee,  son of the sword, I would desire warm blood, a lynx's eye, a fox's  craft, and the strength of Hercules. Why do you cross yourself? Blood  of God! What should a lion's cub be doing with this mimicry of women  at their prayers!\"    \"Hark! It is the Angelus, my Lord Father,\" answered the child.              XII      May and June that year were in very truth the months of flowers. Never  had Flanders known the hawthorn so fragrant, never the gardens so gay  with roses, jasmine, and honeysuckle. And when the wind blew eastwards  from England it carried with it the breath of all this flowery land,  and the people, at Antwerp and elsewhere, sniffed the air joyfully  and cried aloud:    \"How good the scent of the wind that blows from Flanders!\"    Then it was that the bees were busy sucking honey from the flowers,  making wax, and laying their eggs within the hives that were all too  small to house the swarms. What workman's music they made, under that  canopy of azure sky that was spread so dazzlingly over the rich earth!    The hives were made of rushes, straw, osiers or of wattled hay. And  there the bees, like clever basket-makers, lined and tunnelled  the hives with their beautifully fitting tools. And as for the  bread-makers, this long time past their numbers were scarce sufficient  for the work they had to do. In a single swarm there would be as many  as three thousand bees and two thousand seven hundred drones! The  quality of the comb was so exquisite that the Dean of Damme dispatched  eleven combs to the Emperor Charles out of gratitude for the new  edicts that had revived in Flanders the earlier vigour of the Holy  Inquisition. It was Philip, forsooth, that ate them all; but little  good did they do him!    But in Flanders, the rascals of the roads, the beggars and vagabonds  and all that lazy good-for-nothing crowd who would risk hanging rather  than do a day's work, were soon enticed by the taste of the honey to  come along and steal their share. And by night they prowled around  the hives in gangs. Now Claes had made some hives for the purpose  of attracting the wandering swarms of bees, and some of these hives  were full already, but there were others that stood empty waiting for  the bees. Claes kept watch all night to guard this sugary wealth of  his; and when he was tired he asked Ulenspiegel to take his place,  the which Ulenspiegel did right willingly.    It was a cold night, and Ulenspiegel to avoid the chill took refuge  in one of the hives, curling himself up inside, and looking out from  two openings that had been made in the roof of the hive.    Just as he was going off to sleep, he heard a rustle in the bushy  hedge near by, and then the voices of two men. They were thieves,  no doubt, and peering forth from the openings aforesaid, Ulenspiegel  saw that they both had long hair and long beards, which was strange,  for a long beard is usually the sign of a nobleman. However, the two  men went peering from hive to hive, and coming at last to the one in  which Ulenspiegel was hiding, they tried its weight, and then----    \"Let us take this one,\" they said. \"It is the heaviest.\"    Whereupon they slung it up between them, on a couple of poles, and  carried it off. Ulenspiegel did not at all fancy being thus carted  away in a hive. But the night was clear, and the two thieves marched  along with never a word. When they had gone about fifty paces they  would stop to take breath, and then set off again. The man in front  grumbled angrily all the time at the weight of his burden. And the  man behind whined in a querulous fashion. Even so are there always  to be found two sorts of idle fellows in this world, those who are  angry at having to work, and those who merely whine at having to.    Ulenspiegel, since there seemed nothing else to do, took hold of the  hair of the man in front and gave it a pull. And he did the same to the  beard of the man at the rear; and to such purpose that the two men soon  grew annoyed at what was happening, and Mr. Angry said to Mr. Whining:    \"Hi there, stop pulling my hair, you, or else I'll give you such a  whack on the head that it'll squash down into your chest, and then  you'll be looking out of your two sides like a thief through the  prison grille!\"    \"I should never think of doing such a thing as to pull your hair,\"  said the whiner. \"But what are you doing there, pulling at my beard?\"    To which Mr. Angry made answer:    \"It isn't I that would go hunting for fleas in the wool of a leper!\"    \"O sir,\" said the whiner, \"for goodness' sake don't go shaking the  hive about like this. My poor arms cannot support it any longer.\"    \"I shall shake it out of your arms altogether,\" said the other. Then  unloading himself, he placed the hive upon the ground and fell upon  his companion. And so they fought together, the one cursing, and the  other crying out for mercy.    Ulenspiegel, hearing the sound of blows, came out from the hive,  dragged it behind him into the wood close by, and having placed it  where he could find it again, returned to Claes.    And thus you may see what sort of a profit it is that thieves derive  from their quarrels.              XIII      As he grew up, Ulenspiegel acquired the habit of wandering about among  the fairs and markets of the country-side, and whenever he hit upon a  man who played the oboe, the rebec, or the bagpipes, he would offer him  a patard for a lesson in the art of making those instruments to sing.    He became especially accomplished in the art of playing the rommelpot,  an instrument which is constructed out of a round pot, a bladder, and  a straight piece of straw. And this is the way he played it. First of  all he moistened the bladder and held it over the pot. Then he drew  the centre of the bladder round the joint of a straw which itself was  attached to the bottom of the pot. Finally he stretched the bladder  as tightly as he dared over the sides of the pot. In the morning,  when the bladder was dry, it sounded like a tambourine when struck,  and if one rubbed the straw it gave forth a humming sound as fine  in tone as that of any violin. And Ulenspiegel, with his musical  pot that played music like the baying of a mastiff, went out with  the other children on the day of Epiphany carrying a star made of  luminous paper, and singing carols.    Sometimes an artist would come to Damme to paint the members of one  of the Guilds, upon their knees. Ulenspiegel was always anxious  to see how the artist worked, and he would beg to be allowed to  grind the colours in return for nothing but a slice of bread, three  liards, and a pint of ale. But while he worked away at the grinding  he would carefully study the method of his master. When the artist  went away Ulenspiegel would endeavour to paint pictures like him;  and his favourite colour was scarlet. In this way he tried to paint  the portraits of Claes, of Soetkin, and of Katheline and Nele, as  well as those of the pots and pans in the kitchen. When Claes beheld  these works of art he predicted that if only he worked hard enough  Ulenspiegel would one day be able to earn florins by the"]]]
