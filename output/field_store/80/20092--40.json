British, Roman,  Norman to 13th century.]    No doubt the sandal of various forms was much used for footwear through  this period, also a simple low shoe which was held on by the  leg-strappings, as, about the 8th century, shoes are seen with loops at  the upper edge, these being attachments for the binding, and this was  no doubt a method from the prehistoric times.    There was also a soft boot reaching to the calf, laced up the front;  and, after the 8th century, a rather pointed shoe, open down the instep,  laced, tied, or gathered into a buckle about the ankle.          CHAPTER III      TENTH TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY. FEMALE.    The head-dress of women now began to show a preference to confine the  hair with nets and to close in the face, which continued till the 15th  century. The circlet and long plait or plaits and the flowing hair  remained till the 14th century. In the 12th century we discover the hair  gathered in nets at either side of the head, covering the ears. A  low-crowned hat was bound over with a band of lawn or fine material  passing underneath the chin, otherwise the plaits were looped up under a  circlet which was also worn with the flowing hair.    A square effect was aimed at in the 13th century with tight side-plaits  bound into a shape or netted hair was strapped to the head as in Fig. 11  (see p. 65). A fall of fine material softened the hard effect, and many  ladies of quality bound the face, neck, and head in the wimple of fine  linen, sometimes gathering this to the same quaint shape of the netted  hair. I give a variety of these settings on page 65. A kerchief of linen  coming round the neck was brought up tightly round the face and  festooned on the top of the head, while another piece was pinned close  to the brows and fell loosely to the shoulders, being often held on by a  circlet as well.    This character was maintained till the early 14th century, when a style  of high peaked hats came into evidence, one shape of which became the  most imposing feature of historic costume in the 15th century. It was  still but a simple form in the middle of the 14th century, for another  shape first gained predominance. Early in this century also may be noted  a curious shape like the cap of liberty, usually with a long tail at the  back as drawn on page 59. This carried design to the eccentric forms of  the pig-tailed hood, and then the rival of the high peaked hat took its  place towards the end of the 14th century--a cushioned head-dress, which  rose and divided in a hornlike structure. It started as in Fig.  25, and I have illustrated its progress; the veil draping was a great  feature, giving plenty of scope for individual fancy. It was, as a rule,  richly decorated with gold and jewels, and the hair was completely  enclosed in a gold net and a tight-fitting cap to hold this erection.  Large drop ear-rings were much worn, and a fine chain of gems encircled  the neck or fell to the breast.    [Illustration: Plate IV.--        (_c_) Youth's Jacket of Linen Embroidered in Worsted. 1635-65.            _Pattern, see p. 299._      (_d_) Linen Male Jacket Embroidered with Gold and Silk. 1600-40.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Tenth to thirteenth century.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.        _Henry II._      _John_      _Henry I._      _Richard I._]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Twelfth to fourteenth century.]    In the 10th century a long close-fitting robe was in fashion, sometimes  with a deep =V=-shaped neck opening, though usually the neck was cut to a  round form. Some sleeves were tighter with a small cuff, but usually the  outer garment had a falling sleeve with a square or round end showing  the tight undersleeve. The outer sleeve varied much in length, from the  elbow or hand dropping even to the ground; it was narrow and widened  through the 14th century, when its edge was cut into various patterns as  in Fig. 18 (see p. 79). In the 13th century we notice a long sleeve  opened at the elbow for the under sleeve to come through, which  beautiful style continued to the middle of the 17th century.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.        _Norman, 12th century_      _Saxon, 12th century_]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Fourteenth century, 1st half.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Fourteenth century, 2nd half.]    With the 10th century came the first corselet from the waist to the hip,  clasping a loose tunic with an under-dress taking a long pointed  train. The manner of tucking the tunic under the corselet when it was  worn over it, and so creating festoons, is worthy of notice as  interesting in arrangement and design.    The 13th century parti-coloured and striped dresses foreshadowed the  heraldic fashion, which must be studied for its proportion and treatment  of decorative colour-values in counterchange to get the true value of  its noble effects.    A great feature now appears in the chasuble-shaped front or setting to a  closely cut jacket. This ultimately becomes the decorative stomacher  through the later periods, and it is very interesting to note its  development.    In the 13th century this jacket was a fur construction of a long simple  form opened at the sides to the hips for the sleeves to come through; it  had a straight hem or was rounded at the front points, and a chasuble  form of it was treated as in Fig. 13 or in conjunction with a short  cape; it was chiefly a decoration of ermine. It grew into a complete  jacket, and in the 14th century it was heavily ornamented with gems; and  the simple front, from being a feature outside the jacket, was later  often enclosed at the sides. The jacket itself is beautiful in form and  proportion, and the curved band of design over the hips makes a nice  foil to the curved front. This pattern is plainly derived from the  effect of the rich girdle that was at first seen through the side  openings and few jackets are without it, the usual shaping of the neck  with most of these was square.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Nos. 1 to 7, 14th century. Nos. 8 and 9, 15th  century.]    In the first quarter of the 14th century the setting of the neck was of  a round shape, and after 1350 a raised or curved form is favoured. Later  still, and with the hornlike head-dress, a very deep =V= shape, open  almost to the belt was the mode, often being filled in with velvet. At  the same time some began to take up the fashions of a very high collar  and a round-shaped body and sleeves, as in Fig. 24 (see p. 89), with  which a wide pointed belt is seen. Some robes were opened in front up to  the height of the girdle, though many dresses were worn without girdles  after the 12th century. Decorated pockets are sometimes seen in the  later period, and an interesting hand-covering or falling cuff came with  them.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Nos. 1 to 3, 14th century. Nos. 4 to 9, 15th  century.]    The cloak as described in the 10th century still continued till the  12th, as well as the light wrap which may almost be placed with any  period, though mostly a feature of the more classic styles.    Skirts and underskirts were worn with trains. They were mostly banded  with wide borders of ornament up to the 13th century, the fullness being  often gathered to the back and front.    The chasuble-shaped overdress was worn to the middle of the 14th  century, sleeveless, and, laced or sewn tight to the figure from the arm  to the hip, or completely down the sides, generally reached just below  the knee.    The shoes were of much the same character as those of the male examples  illustrated, though they hardly reached the same extravagance in length,  owing, no doubt, to the feet of woman being hampered by her skirt; but I  suspect they even braved high wooden clogs, as we know they did the tall  chopins of the 16th century, to heighten their stature.

From the 10th to the 15th century, we find costume developing rapidly  into elaborate and interesting designs. Close relations with the  Continent brought new ideas, and rich velvets and brocades interwoven  with gold enhanced the gorgeousness of attire, while the introduction of  heraldic design brought in a very picturesque element. Hats and  head-dresses began to become important features, enlarging to eccentric  shapes and proportions, only equalled in the extravagant part of the  18th century.    It may be noted that feminine fashion, as it assumes new characters and  proportions, affects the style of the male clothes in the same way, as,  when a high or pointed head-dress comes in, the male hat also increases  its size; the same with curved or angular designs, full or tight  sleeves.    The hair was worn long and rather squared in shape at the back till the  end of the 15th century. A tendency to shut in the face by close hoods  tied under the chin is remarked, and this forms a strong feature of the  13th and 14th centuries. Ear-rings were seldom worn after the 10th  century; but the neck was generally adorned with heavy chain  decorations.    Beards assumed a pointed shape in accordance with this development of  fashion, and double-pointed beards were revived between 1380 and 1386.  Hats of straw with mushroom brims and round tops came into vogue in the  11th century, covered with coloured materials and finished with a spike  or button at the top, and the crowns"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34949"],[0,"Some Reptiles and Amphibians from Korea (#5)"],[1,", and probably  represent young of the year. The snake found in hibernation on April 5  measured 275 in length of body. The ventrals of 11 males averaged 161.3  (158-171) and those of 14 females, 165.1 (160-170); subcaudals of eight  males averaged 69.6 (66-74) and those of 14 females, 61.5 (52-73).    Males seem to have small scales in the anal region that are more  strongly keeled than scales elsewhere on the body (the scales catch on  finger tips when rubbed in a posteroanterior direction), but males lack  small tubercles on the upper and lateral parts of the head as mentioned  by Maslin (1950:433). The comments of the same author (_op. cit._:434)  concerning integumental poison glands in the nuchal region of this  species are of interest in view of several reports that we received of  swollen extremities resulting from handling snakes of this species.    In using the generic names _Rhabdophis_ and _Amphiesma_ for species  formerly placed in the genus _Natrix_, we follow Malnate (1960), who  divided _Natrix (auct.)_ into five distinct genera.      =Amphiesma vibakari ruthveni= (Van Denburgh)        _Natrix vibakari ruthveni_ Van Denburgh, Proc. California Acad.        Sci., ser. 4, 13(2):3, July 26, 1923 (type locality, Pusan,        Korea).        _Specimens examined_ (5).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 1 (KU); 4 mi. SW Ch'ongyang-ni, 1 (KU); 10 mi. NE      Mosulp'o, Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ); 6-7 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1      (KU), 1 (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--The specimen from the Central National Forest was captured  on August 18 near a stream on a damp ground-cover of leaves. The  specimens from Cheju Do were taken in early September, one in a grassy  area, and the other two on earthen banks of road-cuts on the slopes of  Halla San. The stomach of one individual from Cheju Do contained an  earthworm. Our largest specimen, a male having 154 ventrals and 68  subcaudals, measured 508 (380 + 128).    The subcaudal counts of 68 (KU 38861) and 69 (UMMZ 113461) on two males  from Cheju Do are higher than the maximal count known for the subspecies  _ruthveni_ in Korea, and resemble those of _Amphiesma vibakari vibakari_  of the Japanese islands. The subcaudals average 61 (55-65) in _ruthveni_  and 71 (63-83) in _vibakari_ according to Van Denburgh (1923:3-4). A  juvenile from the Central National Forest (KU 38862), lacking the tip of  the tail, has 64 subcaudals.      =Dinodon rufozonatum= (Cantor)        _Lycodon rufo-zonatus_ Cantor, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 1, 9:483,        August, 1842 (type locality, island of Chusan, China).        _Dinodon rufozonatus_, Peters, Sitzungsber. Gesell. naturf. Freunde        Berlin, p. 89, 1881.        _Specimens examined_ (4).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 3 (KU); Yongsan (Seoul), 1 (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--The three specimens from the Central National Forest were  taken in the period August 12-26. Two were caught in live-traps set for  small mammals in deep forest among granite outcrops. The specimen from  Yongsan was obtained on October 27 in a partly wooded area. Ventrals and  subcaudals of our four specimens (all males) numbered, respectively,  198, 200, 198, 205, and 74, 75, 75, __. Total length of the largest  specimen was 960 (790 + 170).    We follow Chang (1932:54) and most subsequent authors in regarding _D.  rufozonatum_ as a monotypic species.      =Zamenis spinalis= (Peters)        _Masticophis spinalis_ Peters, Monatsber. preuss. Akad. Wiss.,        Berlin, p. 91 (for 1866), 1867 (type locality, unknown--\"Mexico\"        erroneously listed).        _Zamenis spinalis_, G[:u]nther, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 4, 9:22,        January, 1872.        _Specimens examined_ (2).--5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. NNE      Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (KU).    _Remarks._--The specimen from Cheju Do was captured on September 9 in  tall grass near a small stream and was eating a small _Rhabdophis  tigrina_. The female from near Seoul was obtained from a Korean on June  10, and was gravid (six eggs, each approximately 35 mm. in length). The  length of body measured approximately 550 and the length of incomplete  tail 168 in one specimen (KU 38777, female from 5 mi. ESE Seoul), 540  and 183 in the other (KU 38778, female from Cheju Do). Respective  ventral and subcaudal counts of the two females are 204, 194, and 74+,  86.    There is some disagreement in the literature as to the proper generic  name of this snake. Differences in dentition between Old World species  (referable to _Zamenis_) and the American species (referable to  _Coluber_) are discussed by Bogert and Oliver (1945:365). The species  _spinalis_ has been referred to _Coluber_ by several authors (see Pope,  1935:226).      =Elaphe dione= (Pallas)        _Coluber dione_ Pallas, Reise durch verschiedene Provinzen des        Russischen Reichs, 2:717, 1773 (type locality, \"Salt steppes        toward the Caspian Sea\" according to Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat.        Mus., 58:315, July 22, 1907).        _Elaphis dione_, Dum['e]ril and Bibron, Erp['e]tologie        g['e]n['e]rale ..., 7:248, 1854.        _Specimens examined_ (10).--Choksong, 1 (KU); 4 mi. N Ch'onan, 1      (KU); Seoul, 1 (KU); 5 mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU), 2 (UMMZ); 5 mi. ESE      Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 1 (UMMZ); Taegwang-ni, 1 (KU); 2 mi.      WSW Tongjonggok, 1 (KU).    _Remarks._--This species seemingly occurs in upland habitats. Specimens  were taken on rocky hillsides, on sparsely wooded hillsides, and in  cultivated fields. November 21 was the latest date of capture of an  active individual (UMMZ 113451), the head of which was seen many times  prior to capture protruding from a hole beneath the concrete floor of a  building. A female (KU 38855), measuring 915 (775 + 140) in total  length, and obtained on June 13, contained nine eggs (32 mm. long). One  juvenile had eaten a half-grown house mouse, _Mus musculus_; the stomach  of a male contained three mice, one a striped field mouse, _Apodemus  agrarius_, the other two probably also of that species but too far  digested for certain identification. Eggs probably hatch in late summer.  A young of the year (length of body, 340) was captured on September 30;  another juvenile (length of body, 285) was obtained in May.    Our largest male (KU 40123) measured 904 (719 + 185) in total length.  Ventrals and subcaudals of six females averaged 205.8 (198-211) and 62.2  (55-69), respectively, whereas corresponding counts of four males  averaged 196.8 (190-214), and 71.0 (69-74). Each of nine specimens had  dorsal scales in 23-25-19 rows except one (UMMZ 113451), which had  23-25-23 rows.      =Elaphe rufodorsata= (Cantor)        _Tropidonotus rufodorsatus_ Cantor, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 1,        9:483, August, 1842 (type locality, island of Chusan, China).        _Elaphe rufodorsata_, Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:310,        figs. 269-271, July 22, 1907.        _Specimens examined_ (27).--7 mi. NW Changhowan-ni, 1 (KU); 3 mi. NW      Chip'o-ri, 3 (KU); 7 mi. W Ch'ungju, 2 (KU), 1 (UMMZ); 3 mi. S      Kumhwa, 2 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 4 mi. E Seoul, 1 (KU); 5      mi. E Seoul, 2 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 2 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (KU),      2 (UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE Seoul, 5 (KU); 4 mi. N Uijongbu, 1 (KU); 5 mi.      NE Uijongbu, 1 (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--_E. rufodorsata_ was commonly observed and collected on  barren hillsides, on country roads, in rice fields, and along drainage  ditches and small streams. One was found sunning outstretched on a road.  Two individuals were trapped in cement-walled pits at the Seoul City  Water Works. On April 5, five snakes of this species with one  _Rhabdophis tigrina_ and one _Agkistrodon halys_, all partly caked with  earth, were found sunning in a shallow depression on the side of a  Korean burial mound, which was presumably a hibernaculum. Aside from one  juvenile, four of the _E. rufodorsata_ were of approximately the same  size, having bodies ranging in length from 385 to 455.    Copulation was observed on April 25 (male, KU 38811, length of body,  400, and female, KU 38812, length of body, 565), and on May 4 (female,  KU 38816, length of body, 620). Eggs doubtless hatch at various times in  summer. One of five snakes obtained on April 5 (see above) measured 310  (250 + 60) in total length. Another juvenile (KU 38828), obtained on  October 18, was 478 (385 + 93) long, and our smallest specimen of this  species (KU 38821), captured on June 26, measured 275 (230 + 45).    The stomachs of two snakes each contained a _Rana nigromaculata_;  another individual had eaten a _Hyla arborea_, and a fourth specimen had  eaten a small fish. One specimen was parasitized by a cestode.    The largest female from our series (KU 38816) measured 740 (620 + 120),  and the largest male (KU 38813), 595 (475 + 120). Respective ventral and  subcaudal counts of 13 males averaged 170.5 (167-174) and 60.0 (56-63),  ventrals of 12 females averaged 178.3 (169-182), and subcaudals of 11  averaged 51.0 (46-56).      =Elaphe schrencki anomala= (Boulenger)        _Coluber anomalus_ Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 17:243,        March, 1916 (type locality, Chihfeng, China).        _Elaphe schrencki anomala_, Pope, The reptiles of China, p. 266,        fig. 57, May 11, 1935.        _Specimens examined_ (7).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 2 (KU), 1 (UMMZ); 4-1/2 mi.

ESE Seoul, 1      (KU).    _Remarks._--Individuals were observed or taken on dry, scrubby hillsides  and in grassy upland areas. One of the three snakes from the Central  National Forest was captured on a steep, forested hillside among granite  outcroppings; another was obtained there along a stream bank and had  eaten three bats, _Murina aurata_ (see Jones, 1960:265), and one mouse,  _Apodemus_ sp. (tail only found). P. M. Youngman reported (personal  communication) finding a rat (_Rattus_ sp.) in"]]]
