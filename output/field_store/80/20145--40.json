Our limits will not permit us to quote any of the remaining poems of this  volume in full, and we conclude our extracts with a few passages penciled  while in a hasty reading. In the piece entitled The Kings of Sorrow, the  poet sings:        Was HE not sad amid the grief and strife, the Lord of light and life,      Whose torture made humanity divine, upon that woful hill of Palestine?      Then is it not far better thus to be, thoughtful, and brave, and melancholy,      Than given up to idle revelry, amid the unreligious brood of folly?      For our sorrow is a worship, worship true, and pure, and calm,      Sounding from the choir of duty like a high, heroic psalm,      In its very darkness bearing to the bleeding heart a balm.      Brothers, we must have no wailing: do we agonize alone?      Look at all the pallid millions; hear a universal moan,      From the mumbling, low-browed Bushman to a Lytton on his throne.      Nor shall we have coward faltering: Brothers! we must be sublime      By due labor at the forges blazing in the cave of Time;      Knowing life was made for duty, and that only cowards prate      Of a search for Happy Valley and the hard decrees of fate:      Seeing through this night of mourning all the future as a star,      And a joy at last appearing on the centuries afar,      When the meaning of the sorrow, when the mystery shall be plain,      When the Earth shall see her rivers roll through Paradise again.      O! the vision gives to sorrow something white and purple-plumed:      Even the hurricane of Evil comes a hurricane perfumed.    In the same:        ... The Storm is silent while we speak;      The awe-struck Cloud hath paused above the peak;      The far Volcano statlier waves on high      His smoking censer to the solemn sky;      And see, the troubled Ocean folds his hands      With a great patience on the yellow sands.    In Rest:        So rest! and Rest shall slay your many woes;      Motion is god-like--god-like is repose,      A mountain-stillness, of majestic might,      Whose peaks are glorious with the quiet light      Of suns when Day is at his solemn close.      Nor deem that slumber must ignoble be.      Jove labored lustily once in airy fields;      And over the cloudy lea      He planted many a budding shoot      Whose liberal nature daily, nightly yields      A store of starry fruit.      His labor done, the weary god went back      Up the long mountain track      To his great house; there he did wile away      With lightest thought a well-won holiday;      For all the Powers crooned softly an old tune      Wishing their Sire might sleep      Through all the sultry noon      And cold blue night;      And very soon      They heard the awful Thunderer breathing low and deep.      And in the hush that dropped adown the spheres,      And in the quiet of the awe-struck space,      The worlds learned worship at the birth of years:      They looked upon their Lord's calm, kingly face.      And bade Religion come and kiss each starry place.    In the same:        See what a languid glory binds      The long dim chambers of the darkling West,      While far below yon azure river winds      Like a blue vein on sleeping Beauty's breast.    In The Gods of Old:        Not realmless sit the ancient gods        Upon their mountain-thrones      In that old glorious Grecian Heaven        Of regal zones.      A languor o'er their stately forms        May lie,      And a sorrow on their wide white brows,        King-dwellers of the sky!      But theirs is still that large imperial throng        Of starry thoughts and firm but quiet wills,      That murmured past the blind old King of Song,        When staring round him on the Thunderer's hills.    In the same:          ... Still Love, sublime, shall wrap      His awful eyebrows in Olympian shrouds.        Or take along the Heaven's dark wilderness      His thunder-chase behind the hunted clouds.      And mortal eyes upturned shall behold      Apollo's robe of gold      Sweep through the long blue corridor of the sky      That, kindling, speaks its Deity:      And He, the Ruler of the Sunless Land        Of restless ghosts, shall fitfully illume      With smouldering fires, that stir in caverned eyes,        Hell's mournful House of Gloom.    In the Hymn to a Wind, Going Seaward:                            Move on! Move on,      Wind of the wide wild West! Tell thou to all      The Isles, tell thou to all the Continents      The grandeur of my land! Speak of its vales      Where Independence wears a pastoral wreath      Amid the holy quiet of his flock;      And of its mountains with their cloudy beards      Tossed by the breath of centuries; and speak      Of its tall cataracts that roll their bass        Amid the choral of the midnight storms;      And of its rivers lingering through the plains      So long, that they seem made to measure time;      And of its lakes that mock the haughty sea;      And of its caves where banished gods might find      Night large enough to hide their crownless heads;      And of its sunsets broad and glorious there      O'er Prairies spread like endless oceans on--      And on--and on--over the far dim leagues      Till vision shudders o'er immensity.    In the same:              ----Troubled France      Shall listen to thy calm deep voice, and learn      That Freedom must be calm if she would fix      Her mountain moveless in a heaving world.    In a Chant to the East:        Still! Oh still!        Despite of passion, sin, and ill,      Despite of all this weary world hath brought,        An angel band from Zion's holy hill      Walks gently through the open gate of Thought.      Oh, still! Oh, still!      Despite of passion, sin, and ill,      ONE in red vesture comes in sorrow's time--      ONE crowned with thorns from that far Orient clime,      Who pitying looks on me      And gently asks, \"Poor man, what aileth thee?\"    In the same:        The nations must forever turn to thee,        Feeling thy lustrous presence from afar;      And feed upon thy splendor as a sea        Feeds on the shining shadow of a star.    In Wordsworth:        And many a brook shall murmur in my verse;      And many an ocean join his cloudy bass;      And many a mountain tower aloft, whereon      The black storm crouches, with his deep-red eyes      Glaring upon the valleys stretch'd below;      And many a green wood rock the small, bright birds      To musical sleep beneath the large, full moon;      And many a star shall lift on high her cup      Of luminous cold chrysolite, set in gold      Chased subtilely over by angelic art;      To catch the odorous dews which poets drink      In their wide wanderings; and many a sun      Shall press the pale lips of the timorous morn      Couch'd in the bridal east: and over all      Will brood the visible presence of the ONE      To whom my life has been a solemn chant.    In the Last Words of Washington:        There is an awful stillness in the sky,      When after wondrous deeds and light supreme,      A star goes out in golden prophecy.      There is an awful stillness in the world,      When after wondrous deeds and light supreme,      Sceptres refused and forehead crowned with truth,      A Hero dies, with all the future clear      Before him, and his voice made jubilant      By coming glories, and his nation hushed,      As though they heard the farewell of a god.      A great man is to earth as God to Heaven.    In Greenwood Cemetery:        O, ye whose mouldering frames were brought and placed      By pious hands within these flowery slopes      And gentle hills, where are ye dwelling now?      For man is more than element! The soul      Lives in the body as the sunbeam lives      In trees or flowers that were but clay without.      Then where are ye, lost sunbeams of the mind?      Are ye where great Orion towers and holds      Eternity on his stupendous front?      Or where pale Neptune in the distant space      Shows us how far, in his creative mood,      With pomp of silence and concentred brows,      The Almighty walked? Or haply ye have gone      Where other matter roundeth into shapes      Of bright beatitude: Or do ye know      Aught of dull space or time, and its dark load      Of aching weariness?    Mr. Wallace is somewhat too much of a rhetorician, and he has a few defects  of manner which, from this frequent repetition, he seems to regard as  beauties. Peculiar phrases, of doubtful propriety, but which have a musical  roll, occur in many of his poems, so that they become very prominent; this  fault, however, belongs chiefly to his earlier pieces; the extracts we have  given, we think will amply vindicate to the most critical judgments, the  praise here awarded to him as a poet of singular and unusual powers,  original, earnest, and in a remarkable degree _national_. It can scarcely  be said of any of our bards that they have caught their inspiration more  directly from observation and experience, or that their effusions, whatever  the distinction they have in art, are more genuine in feeling.          AMERICA AS ABUSED BY A GERMAN.      Having made it a point to faithfully report all that is said of our country  by foreign travellers or journalists, we deem it a duty to lay before our  readers not only the more agreeable accounts given by those who have  impartially examined our institutions and manners, but also the more  prejudiced relations of those who, urged by interest or ill-nature, have  sketched simply the darker and more irregular outlines. And we are the more  induced to follow this course since we are fully convinced that it is  productive of equal good with the former. We have--particularly to English  eyes--appeared as a people who eagerly devour all that is said to our  discredit, and at the same time fiercely repudiate the slightest  insinuation that we in any thing fall short of perfection.

'It is for a very important personage,  then?' said the seller disdainfully, looking at the concierge's  threadbare clothes. 'Yes,' said he, 'it is for some one who was once  very important; she is so no longer; it is for the Queen.' 'The  Queen,' exclaimed the tradeswoman, turning over all her melons, 'the  Queen! Oh, poor woman! Here, make her eat that, and I won't have you  pay for it....'    \"One of the gendarmes on duty having smoked during the night, learnt  the following day that the Queen, whom he noticed was very pale, had  suffered from the smell of the tobacco; he smashed his pipe, swearing  not to smoke any more. It was he also who said to those who came in  contact with Marie Antoinette: 'Whatever you do, don't say anything to  her about her children'.\"    For her trial the Queen was taken to the Tribunal sitting in what is  now the First Circle Chamber of the Palais de Justice, and led back in  the evening to her cell. She was condemned to death on the fifteenth,  and that night wrote a letter to her sister-in-law Elizabeth which we  shall see in the Archives Nationales: it is firmly written.      [Illustration: GIOVANNA TORNABUONI AND THE CARDINAL VIRTUES      BOTTICELLI. FRESCO FROM THE VILLA LEMMI      (_Louvre_)]    The Conciergerie had many other prisoners, but none so illustrious.  Robespierre occupied for twenty-four hours the little cell adjoining  that of the Queen, now the vestry of the chapel. Madame Du Barry and  Madame Recamier had cells adjacent to that of Madame Roland. Later  Marechal Ney was imprisoned here. The oldest part of all--the kitchens  of Saint Louis--are not shown.    The Pont au Change, the bridge which connects the Place du Chatelet  with the Boulevard du Palais, the main street of the Ile de la Cite,  was once (as the Ponte Vecchio at Florence still is) the headquarters  of goldsmiths and small bankers. Not the least of the losses that  civilisation and rebuilders have brought upon us is the disappearance  of the shops and houses from the bridges. Old London Bridge--how one  regrets that!    At the corner of the Conciergerie is the Horloge that gives the Quai  its name--a floridly decorated clock which by no means conveys the  impression that it has kept time for over five hundred years and is  the oldest exposed time-piece in France. Paris, by the way, is very  poor in public clocks, and those that she has are not too trustworthy.  The one over the Gare St. Lazare has perhaps the best reputation; but  time in Paris is not of any great importance. For most Parisians there  is an inner clock which strikes with perfect regularity at about  twelve and seven, and no other hours really matter. And yet a certain  show of marking time is made in the hotels, where every room has an  elaborate ormolu clock, usually under a glass case and rarely going.  And in one hotel I remember a large clock on every landing, of which I  passed three on my way upstairs; and their testimony was so various  that it was two hours later by each, so that by the time I had reached  my room it was nearly time to get up. On asking the waiter the reason  he said it was because they were synchronised by electricity.    There has been a Tour de l'Horloge at this corner of the Conciergerie  ever since it was ordained by Philippe le Bel in 1299; the present  clock, or at least its scheme of decoration, dates, however, from  Henri III.'s reign, about 1585. The last elaborate restoration was in  1852. In the tower above was a bell that was rung only on rare  occasions. The usual accounts of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew say  that the signal for that outrage was sounded by the bell of St.  Germain l'Auxerrois; but others give it to the bell of the Tour de  l'Horloge. As they are some distance from each other, perhaps both  were concerned; but since St. Germain l'Auxerrois is close to the  Louvre, where the King was waiting for the carnage to begin, it is  probable that it rang the first notes.    One of Meryon's most impressive and powerful etchings represents the  Tour de l'Horloge and the facade of the Conciergerie. It is a typical  example of his strange and gloomy genius, for while it is nothing else  in the world but what it purports to be, it is also quite unlike the  Tour de l'Horloge and the facade of the Conciergerie as any ordinary  eyes have seen them. They are made terrible and sinister: they have  been passed through the dark crucible of Meryon's mind. To see Paris  as Meryon saw it needs a great effort of imagination, so swiftly and  instinctively do these people remove the traces of unhappiness or  disaster. It is the nature of Paris to smile and to forget; from any  lapse into woe she recovers with extraordinary rapidity.    Meryon's Paris glowers and shudders; there is blood on her hands and  guilt in her heart. I will not say that his concept is untrue, because  I believe that the concept formed by a man of genius is always true,  although it may not contain all the truth, and indeed one has to  recall very little history to fall easily into Meryon's mood; but for  the visitor who has chosen Paris for his holiday--the typical reader,  for example, of this book--Mr. Dexter's concept of Paris is a more  natural one. (I wish, by the way, before it is too late, that Mr.  Muirhead Bone would devote some time to the older parts of the  city--particularly to the Marais. How it lies to his hand!)    Since we are at the gates of the Palais de Justice let us spend a  little time among the advocates and their clients in the great  hall--the Salle des Pas Perdus. (In an interesting work, by the way,  on this building, with a preface by the younger Dumas, the amendment,  \"La Salle du temps perdu\" is recommended.) The French law courts, as a  whole, are little different from our own: they have the same  stuffiness, they give the same impression of being divided between the  initiated and the uninitiated, the little secret society of the Bar  and the great innocent world. But the Salle des Pas Perdus is another  thing altogether. There is nothing like that in the Strand. Our Strand  counsel are a dignified, clean-shaven, be-wigged race, striving to  appear old and inscrutable and important. They are careful of  appearances; they receive instructions only through solicitors; they  affect to weigh their words; sagacious reserve is their fetish. Hence  our law courts, although there are many consultations and incessant  passings to and fro, are yet subdued in tone and overawing to the  talkative.    But the Palais de Justice!--Babel was inaudible beside it. In the  Palais de Justice everyone talks at once; no one cares a sou for  appearances or reticence; there are no wigs, no shorn lips, no  affectation of a superhuman knowledge of the world. The French  advocate comes into direct communication with his client--for the most  part here. The movement as well as the vociferation is incessant, for  out of this great hall open as many doors as there are in a French  farce, and every door is continually swinging. Indeed that is the  chief effect conveyed: that one is watching a farce, since there has  never been a farce yet without a legal gentleman in his robes and  black velvet cap. The chief difference is that here there are hundreds  of them. As a final touch of humour, or lack of gravity, I may add  that notices forbidding smoking are numerous, and every advocate and  every client is puffing hard at his cigarette.    Victor Hugo's _Notre Dame_ begins, it will be remembered, in the great  Hall of the Palais de Justice, where Gringoire's neglected mystery  play was performed and Quasimodo won the prize for ugliness. The Hall,  as Hugo says, was burned in 1618: by a fire which, he tells us, was  made necessary by the presence in the archives of the Palais of the  documents in the case of the assassination of Henri IV. by Ravaillac.  Certain of Ravaillac's accomplices and instigators wishing these  papers to disappear, the fire followed as a matter of course, as  naturally as in China a house had to be burned down before there could  be roast pig.    Sainte Chapelle, which, with the kitchens of Saint Louis under the  Conciergerie, is all that remains of the royal period of the Palais de  Justice, is, except on Mondays, always open during the reasonable  daylight hours and is wholly free from vexatious restrictions.  Sanctity having passed from it, the French sightseers do not even  remove their hats, although I have noticed that the English and  Americans still find the habit too strong. The Chapelle may easily  disappoint, for such is the dimness of its religious light that little  is visible save the dark coloured windows. One is, however, conscious  of perfect proportions and such ecclesiastical elegance as paint and  gold can convey. It is in fact exquisite, yet not with an  exquisiteness of simplicity but of design and elaboration. It is like  a jewel--almost a trinket--which Notre Dame might have once worn on  her breast and tired of. Its fleche is really beautiful; it darts into  the sky with only less assurance and joy than that of Notre Dame, and  I always look up with pleasure to the angel on the eastern point of  the roof.      [Illustration: LA VIERGE AUX ROCHERS      LEONARDO DA VINCI      (_Louvre_)]    What one has the greatest difficulty in believing is that Sainte  Chapelle is six hundred and fifty years old. It was built for the  relics brought from the Crusades by Saint Louis, which are now in the  Treasury of Notre Dame. The Chapel has, of course, known the  restorer's hand, but it is virtually the original structure, and some  of the original glass is still here preserved amid reconstructions. To  me Sainte Chapelle's glass makes little appeal; but many of my friends  talk of nothing else. Let us thank God for differences of taste.  During the Commune (as recently as 1871) an attempt was made to burn  Sainte"]]]
