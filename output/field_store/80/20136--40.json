The  commercial treaties of '87 were struck in the same mint, and are notable  as the first effort made by the English government to emancipate the  country from the restrictive policy which had been introduced by the  \"glorious revolution;\" memorable epoch, that presented England at the  same time with a corn law and a public debt. But on no subject was the  magnetic influence of the descendant of Sir William Petty more decided,  than in the resolution of his pupil to curb the power of the patrician  party by an infusion from the middle classes into the government of  the country. Hence the origin of Mr Pitt's famous and long-misconceived  plans of parliamentary reform. Was he sincere, is often asked by those  who neither seek to discover the causes nor are capable of calculating  the effects of public transactions. Sincere! Why, he was struggling  for his existence! And when baffled, first by the Venetian party, and  afterwards by the panic of Jacobinism, he was forced to forego his  direct purpose, he still endeavoured partially to effect it by a  circuitous process. He created a plebeian aristocracy and blended it  with the patrician oligarchy. He made peers of second-rate squires  and fat graziers. He caught them in the alleys of Lombard Street, and  clutched them from the counting-houses of Cornhill. When Mr Pitt in an  age of bank restriction declared that every man with an estate of ten  thousand a-year had a right to be a peer, he sounded the knell of  \"the cause for which Hampden had died on the field, and Sydney on the  scaffold.\"    In ordinary times the pupil of Shelburne would have raised this country  to a state of great material prosperity, and removed or avoided many  of those anomalies which now perplex us; but he was not destined for  ordinary times; and though his capacity was vast and his spirit lofty,  he had not that passionate and creative genius required by an age of  revolution. The French outbreak was his evil daemon: he had not the  means of calculating its effects upon Europe. He had but a meagre  knowledge himself of continental politics: he was assisted by a very  inefficient diplomacy. His mind was lost in a convulsion of which he  neither could comprehend the causes nor calculate the consequences; and  forced to act, he acted not only violently, but in exact opposition to  the very system he was called into political existence to combat; he  appealed to the fears, the prejudices, and the passions of a privileged  class, revived the old policy of the oligarchy he had extinguished, and  plunged into all the ruinous excesses of French war and Dutch finance.    If it be a salutary principle in the investigation of historical  transactions to be careful in discriminating the cause from the  pretext, there is scarcely any instance in which the application of this  principle is more fertile in results, than in that of the Dutch invasion  of 1688. The real cause of this invasion was financial. The Prince of  Orange had found that the resources of Holland, however considerable,  were inadequate to sustain him in his internecine rivalry with the great  sovereign of France. In an authentic conversation which has descended to  us, held by William at the Hague with one of the prime abettors of the  invasion, the prince did not disguise his motives; he said, \"nothing but  such a constitution as you have in England can have the credit that is  necessary to raise such sums as a great war requires.\" The prince came,  and used our constitution for his purpose: he introduced into England  the system of Dutch finance. The principle of that system was to  mortgage industry in order to protect property: abstractedly, nothing  can be conceived more unjust; its practice in England has been equally  injurious. In Holland, with a small population engaged in the same  pursuits, in fact a nation of bankers, the system was adapted to the  circumstances which had created it. All shared in the present spoil, and  therefore could endure the future burthen. And so to this day Holland  is sustained, almost solely sustained, by the vast capital thus created  which still lingers amongst its dykes. But applied to a country in  which the circumstances were entirely different; to a considerable and  rapidly-increasing population; where there was a numerous peasantry,  a trading middle class struggling into existence; the system of Dutch  finance, pursued more or less for nearly a century and a half, has ended  in the degradation of a fettered and burthened multitude. Nor have the  demoralizing consequences of the funding system on the more favoured  classes been less decided. It has made debt a national habit; it has  made credit the ruling power, not the exceptional auxiliary, of all  transactions; it has introduced a loose, inexact, haphazard, and  dishonest spirit in the conduct of both public and private life; a  spirit dazzling and yet dastardly: reckless of consequences and yet  shrinking from responsibility. And in the end, it has so overstimulated  the energies of the population to maintain the material engagements  of the state, and of society at large, that the moral condition of the  people has been entirely lost sight of.    A mortgaged aristocracy, a gambling foreign commerce, a home trade  founded on a morbid competition, and a degraded people; these are great  evils, but ought perhaps cheerfully to be encountered for the greater  blessings of civil and religious liberty. Yet the first would seem in  some degree to depend upon our Saxon mode of trial by our peers, upon  the stipulations of the great Norman charters, upon the practice and  the statute of Habeas Corpus,--a principle native to our common law,  but established by the Stuarts; nor in a careful perusal of the Bill  of Rights, or in an impartial scrutiny of the subsequent legislation of  those times, though some diminution of our political franchises must be  confessed, is it easy to discover any increase of our civil privileges.  To those indeed who believe that the English nation,--at all times  a religious and Catholic people, but who even in the days of the  Plantagenets were anti-papal,--were in any danger of again falling under  the yoke of the Pope of Rome in the reign of James the Second, religious  liberty was perhaps acceptable, though it took the shape of a discipline  which at once anathematized a great portion of the nation, and virtually  establishing Puritanism in Ireland, laid the foundation of those  mischiefs which are now endangering the empire.    That the last of the Stuarts had any other object in his impolitic  manoeuvres, than an impracticable scheme to blend the two churches,  there is now authority to disbelieve. He certainly was guilty of  the offence of sending an envoy openly to Rome, who, by the bye, was  received by the Pope with great discourtesy; and her Majesty Queen  Victoria, whose Protestantism cannot be doubted, for it is one of her  chief titles to our homage, has at this time a secret envoy at the same  court: and that is the difference between them: both ministers doubtless  working however fruitlessly for the same object: the termination of  those terrible misconceptions, political and religious, that have  occasioned so many martyrdoms, and so many crimes alike to sovereigns  and to subjects.    If James the Second had really attempted to re-establish Popery in this  country, the English people, who had no hand in his overthrow, would  doubtless soon have stirred and secured their \"Catholic and Apostolic  church,\" independent of any foreign dictation; the church to which they  still regularly profess their adherence; and being a practical people,  it is possible that they might have achieved their object and yet  retained their native princes; under which circumstances we might  have been saved from the triple blessings of Venetian politics, Dutch  finance, and French wars: against which, in their happiest days, and  with their happiest powers, struggled the three greatest of English  statesmen,--Bolingbroke, Shelburne, and lastly the son of Chatham.    We have endeavoured in another work, not we hope without something of  the impartiality of the future, to sketch the character and career of  his successors. From his death to 1825, the political history of England  is a history of great events and little men. The rise of Mr Canning,  long kept down by the plebeian aristocracy of Mr Pitt as an adventurer,  had shaken parties to their centre. His rapid disappearance from the  scene left both whigs and tories in a state of disorganization. The  distinctive principles of these connexions were now difficult to trace.  That period of public languor which intervenes between the breaking up  of parties and the formation of factions now transpired in England. An  exhausted sensualist on the throne, who only demanded from his ministers  repose, a voluptuous aristocracy, and a listless people, were content,  in the absence of all public conviction and national passion, to consign  the government of the country to a great man, whose decision relieved  the sovereign, whose prejudices pleased the nobles, and whose  achievements dazzled the multitude.    The DUKE OF WELLINGTON brought to the post of first minister immortal  fame; a quality of success which would almost seem to include all  others. His public knowledge was such as might be expected from one  whose conduct already formed an important portion of the history of his  country. He had a personal and intimate acquaintance with the sovereigns  and chief statesmen of Europe, a kind of information in which English  ministers have generally been deficient, but without which the  management of our external affairs must at the best be haphazard. He  possessed administrative talents of the highest order.    The tone of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],[0,"This Country of Ours (#5)"],[1," night Columbus stood alone upon the poop of the Santa  Maria.  Full of anxious thoughts he gazed out into the darkness.  Then suddenly it seemed to him that far in the distance he saw a  glimmering light appear and disappear once and again.  It was as if  some one walking carried a light.  But so fearful was Columbus lest  his fervent hopes had caused him to imagine this light that he would  not trust his own eyes alone.  So he called to one of his officers  and asked him if he saw any light.    \"Yes,\" replied the officer, \"I see a light.\"    Then Columbus called a second man.  He could not at first see the  light, and in any case neither of them thought much of it.  Columbus,  however, made sure that land was close, and calling the men about  him he bade them keep a sharp look-out, promising a silken doublet  to the man who should first see land.    So till two o'clock in the morning the ships held on their way.  Then  from the Pinta there came again a joyful shout of \"Land!  Land!\"    This time it proved no vision, it was land indeed; and at last the  long-looked-for goal was reached.  The land proved to be an island  covered with beautiful trees, and as they neared the shore the men  saw naked savages crowding to the beach.    In awed wonder these savages watched the huge white birds, as the  ships with their great sails seemed to them.  Nearer and nearer  they came, and when they reached the shore and folded their wings  the natives fled in terror to the shelter of the forest.  But  seeing that they were not pursued, their curiosity got the better  of their fear, and returning again they stood in silent astonishment  to watch the Spaniards land.    First of all came Columbus; over his glittering steel armour he  wore a rich cloak of scarlet, and in his hand he bore the Royal  Standard of Spain.  Then, each at the head of his own ship's crew,  came the captains of the Pinta and the Nina, each carrying in his  hand a white banner with a green cross and the crowned initials  of the King and Queen, which was the special banner devised for  the great adventure.  Every man was dressed in his best, and the  gay-coloured clothes, the shining armour, and fluttering banners  made a gorgeous pageant.  Upon it the sun shone in splendour and the  blue sky was reflected in a bluer sea: while scarlet flamingoes,  startled at the approach of the white men, rose in brilliant flight.    As Columbus landed he fell upon his knees and kissed the ground,  and with tears of joy running down his cheeks he gave thanks to  God, the whole company following his example.  Then rising again to  his feet, Columbus drew his sword, and solemnly took possession of  the island in the name of Ferdinand and Isabella.    When the ceremony was over the crew burst forth into shouts of  triumph and joy.  They crowded round Columbus, kneeling before him  to kiss his hands and feet praying forgiveness for their insolence  and mutiny, and promising in the future to obey him without question.  For Columbus it was a moment of pure joy and triumph.  All his long  years of struggle and waiting had come to a glorious end.    Yet he knew already that his search was not finished, his triumph  not yet complete.  He had not reached the eastern shores of India,  the land of spice and pearls.  He had not even reached Cipango, the  rich and golden isle.  But he had at least, he thought, found some  outlying island off the coast of India, and that India itself could  not be far away.  He never discovered his mistake, so the group of  islands nowhere near India, but lying between the two great Continents  of America, are known as the West Indies.    Columbus called the island upon which he first landed San Salvador,  and for a long time it was thought to be the island which is still  called San Salvador or Cat Island.  But lately people have come to  believe that Columbus first landed upon an island a little further  south, now called, Watling Island.    From San Salvador Columbus sailed about and landed upon several  other islands, naming them and taking possession of them for Spain.  He saw many strange and beautiful fruits: \"trees of a thousand  sorts, straight and tall enough to make masts for the largest ships  of Spain.\" He saw flocks of gaily coloured parrots and many other  birds that sang most sweetly.  He saw fair harbours so safe and  spacious that he thought they might hold all the ships of the world.    But of such things Columbus was not in search.  He was seeking for  gold and jewels, and at every place he touched he hoped to find  some great eastern potentate, robed in splendour and seated upon  a golden throne; instead everywhere he found only naked savages.  They were friendly and gentle, and what gold they had - but it was  little indeed - they willingly bartered for a few glass beads, or  little tinkling bells.    By signs, however, some of these savages made Columbus understand  that further south there was a great king who was so wealthy that  he ate off dishes of wrought gold.  Others told him of a land where  the people gathered gold on the beach at night time by the light of  torches; others again told him of a land where gold was so common  that the people wore it on their arms and legs, and in their ears  and noses as ornaments.  Others still told of islands where there  was more gold than earth.  But Columbus sought these lands in vain.    In his cruisings Columbus found Cuba, and thought at first it must  be the island of Cipango, but finding himself mistaken he decided  at length that he had landed upon the most easterly point of India.  He could not be far, he thought, from the palace of the Grand Khan,  and choosing out two of his company he sent them as ambassadors  to him.  But after six days the ambassadors returned, having found  no gold; and instead of the Grand Khan having seen only a savage  chieftain.    These ambassadors found no gold, but, had they only known it, they  found something quite as valuable.  For they told how they had met  men and women with firebrands in their hands made of herbs, the end  of which they put in their mouths and sucked, blowing forth smoke.  And these fire-brands they called tabacos.    The Spaniards also discovered that the natives of these islands used  for food a root which they dug out of the earth.  But they thought  nothing of these things.  For what were roots and dried herbs to  those who came in search of gold, and gems, and precious spices?  So they brought home neither potatoes nor tobacco.    So far the three little vessels had kept together, but now the  captain of the Pinta parted company with the others, not because  of bad weather, says Columbus in his diary, but because he chose,  and out of greed, for he thought \"that the Indians would show him  where there was much gold.\" This desertion grieved Columbus greatly,  for he feared that Pinzon might find gold, and sailing home before  him cheat him of all the honour and glory of the quest.  But still  the Admiral did not give up, but steered his course \"in the name  of God and in search of gold and spices, and to discover land.\"    So from island to island he went seeking gold, and finding everywhere  gentle, kindly savages, fair birds and flowers, and stately trees.    __________            Chapter 4 - How Columbus Returned Home in Triumph          Christmas Eve came, and the Admiral, being very weary, went below  to sleep, leaving a sailor to steer the ship.  But this sailor thought  he too would like to sleep, so he gave the tiller in charge of a  boy.    Now throughout the whole voyage the Admiral had forbidden this.  Whether it was stormy or calm he had commanded that the helm was  never to be entrusted to a boy.  This boy knew very little of how  to steer a ship, and being caught in a current it was cast upon a  sand-bank and wrecked.  By good luck every one was saved and landed  upon the island of Haiti.  But Columbus had now only one little  vessel, and it was not large enough to carry all the company.  Many  of them, however, were so delighted with the islands that they  wanted to stay there, and they had often asked the Admiral's leave  to do so.    Columbus therefore now determined to allow some of his men to  remain to found a little colony, and trade with the Indians, \"and  he trusted in God that when he came back from Spain - as he intended  to do - he would find a ton of gold collected by them, and that  they would have found a gold mine, and such quantities of spices  that the Sovereigns would in the space of three years be able to  undertake a Crusade and conquer the Holy Sepulchre.\"    So out of the wreck of the Santa Maria Columbus built a fort, and  from the many who begged to be left behind he chose forty-four,  appointing one of them, Diego de Arana, as Governor.  He called the  fort La Navida or The Nativity in memory of the day upon which it  was founded.  The island itself he called Española or Little Spain.    Then on Friday the 4th of January, 1493, the Nina spread her sails  and slowly glided away, leaving in that far island amid the unknown  seas the first colony of white men ever settled in the west.    Two days after Columbus set forth upon his homeward voyage, he  fell in again with the Pinta.  The master had found no gold, so he  determined to join Columbus once more.  He now came on board and  tried to make his peace with Columbus, but the Admiral received him  coldly, for he had little faith in his excuses.  And now once more  together, the two little vessels sailed homeward.  But soon storms  arose, the ships were battered by wind, tossed about hither and  thither by waves, and at length separated again.  More than once  Columbus feared that his tiny vessel would be engulfed in the stormy  seas, and the results of his great enterprise never be known.  But  at length the shores of Portugal were sighted, and on Friday, the  15th of March, 1493, he landed Again at Palos, in Spain, from whence"]]]
