SENTA.          Let go, I say, let go!      ERIK.      Fliehst Du zurück vor dieser Wunde,    Die Du mir schlugst, den Liebeswahn?    O höre mich zu dieser Stunde,    Hör' meine letzte Frage an!    Wenn dieses Herz in Jammer bricht,    Wird's Senta sein, die für mich spricht?          ERIK.          Do not evade me now,        For great it is my grief,        But one word more, then go!        Let me ask, and answer give:--        When this heart strong comfort needs,        Will it Senta be who for me pleads?      SENTA.      Wie? zweifelst Du an meinem Herzen?    Du zweifelst, ob ich gut Dir bin? --    Doch sag', was weckt Dir solche Schmerzen?    Was trübt mit Argwohn Deinen Sinn?          SENTA.          Why doubt my heart, why doubt my love,        Why doubt my devotion's faith and strength?        Why now these thoughts that give but pang,        Why this suspicion all at once?      ERIK.      Dein Vater -- ach! nach Schätzen geizt er nur. . .    Und Senta, Du! Wie dürft' auf Dich ich zählen?    Erfülltest Du nur eine meiner Bitten?    Kränkst Du mein Herz nicht jeden Tag?          ERIK.          Thou knowest well that gold is all thy father careth for,        And he that can offer riches will wed his daughter sure.        These the thoughts that fill my heart with grief,        And then, Senta, thou, too, addest to my anguish.      SENTA.      Dein Herz?          SENTA.          I? And how?      ERIK.      Was soll ich denken. Jenes Bild. . .          ERIK.          Thy worship for that picture--      SENTA.      Das Bild?          SENTA.          This picture?      ERIK.      Lässt Du von Deiner Schwärmerei wohl ab?          ERIK.          'Tis a strange infatuation which--      SENTA.      Kann meinem Blick Theilnahme ich verwehren?          SENTA.          Why should I not feel sympathy?      ERIK.      Und die Ballade, heut noch sangst Du sie!          ERIK.          And the song you love to sing.      SENTA.      Ich bin ein Kind und weiss nicht was ich singe. . . !    Erik, sag'! fürchtest Du ein Lied, ein Bild?          SENTA.          Child am I, and know not what I sing.        Say, Erik, dost a song thou fear, a picture?      ERIK.      Du bist so bleich. . . sag', sollt ich es nicht fürchten?          ERIK.          Thou art so pale, and hence my fear.      SENTA.      Soll mich des Aermsten Schreckensloos nicht rühren?          SENTA.          Why should I not sympathize with the poor man's fate?      ERIK.      Mein Leiden, Senta, rührt es Dich nicht mehr?          ERIK.          Why not rather feel sympathy with _my_ deep grief?      SENTA.      O! schweige doch. Was kann Dein Leiden sein?    Kennst jenes Unglücksel'gen Schicksal Du?    Fühlst Du den Schmerz, den tiefsten Gram,    Mit dem herab auf mich er sieht?    Ach, was die Ruh' ihm ewig nahm,    Wie schneidend Weh durch's Herz mir zieht!          SENTA.          Enough of this! Thou hast no grief;        But dost thou know the pale man's horrid fate,        And dost thou feel how anguish wrung        The look he casts at me in wild despair?        His fate, relentless, bitter fate,        'Tis a pang that wrings my heart.      ERIK.      Weh' mir! Es mahnt mich ein unsel'ger Traum!    Gott schütze Dich! Satan hat Dich umgarnt.          ERIK.          Alas! alas my dream will then come true!        May God protect thee! Thou art in Satan's power.      SENTA.      Was schreckt Dich so?          SENTA.          What is it that so frightens thee?      ERIK.      Senta, lass Dir vertrau'n: --    Ein Traum ist's, -- höre ihn zur Warnung an:    Auf hohem Felsen lag ich träumend,    Sah unter mir des Meeres Fluth;    Die Brandung hört' ich, wie sich schäumend    Am Ufer brach der Wogen Wuth: --    Ein fremdes Schiff am nahen Strande    Erblickt ich, seltsam, wunderbar: --    Zwei Männer nahten sich dem Lande,    Der Ein', ich sah's, Dein Vater war. . .          ERIK.          Listen, Senta, listen well!        A dream it was--let warning voice it be!        The rock that overhangs the sea        Was my bed, and dreaming, I fancied        I saw the waves roll in and out,        And heard the billows' ceaseless roar.        Near the shore a ship I saw,        And strange to tell, for strange the sight:--        Near and nearer two seamen approached,        And one, well I knew his face, thy father was--      SENTA.      Der Andre?          SENTA.          And who was the other, pray?      ERIK.      Wohl erkannt' ich ihn:    Mit schwarzem Wams und bleicher Mien'.          ERIK.          Ah, too well only did I know him,        Dressed in black in contrast strong to his pale face--      SENTA.      Und düst'rem Aug'. . .          SENTA.          And dark and sad his eye--      ERIK.      Der Seemann, er.          ERIK.          Yes, black as jet his eye.      SENTA.      Und ich?          SENTA.          And I? Where was I?      ERIK.      Du kamst vom Hause her,    Du flogst den Vater zu begrüssen;    Doch kaum noch sah ich an Dich langen,    Du stürztest zu des Fremden Füssen --    Ich sah Dich seine Knie umfangen. . .          ERIK.          Fleet as a fawn, startled in fear,        I saw thee rush toward the beach        To bid thy father welcome home,        But scarce arrived, I saw thee kneel        At the feet of the pale man accursed.      SENTA.      Er hob mich auf. . .          SENTA.          And he gently drew me to his breast.      ERIK.      An seine Brust; --    Voll Inbrunst hingst Du Dich an ihn,    Du küsstest ihn mit heisser Lust --          ERIK.          He folded thee to his treacherous heart,        And thou with fervor wild, unbridled,        Returnest kiss for kiss impassionate.      SENTA.      Und dann. . . ?          SENTA.          And then? What then?      ERIK.      Sah ich auf's Meer Euch fliehn.          ERIK.          He took thee on board his shadowy ship.      SENTA.      Er sucht mich auf! Ich muss ihn sehn!    Mit ihm muss ich zu Grunde gehn!          SENTA.          He longs for me! I'll follow him,        And if in the attempt perish I should.      ERIK.      Entsetzlich! Ha, mir wird es klar;    Sie ist dahin! Mein Traum sprach wahr!          ERIK.          Horrid 'tis! I see it clear,        My dream, my fearful dream spoke true.      SENTA.      Ach, wo weilt sie etc. etc.          SENTA.          Where, oh where is the woman so rare,        His love to win, his treasures to share?        DRITTE SCENE.          SCENE III.      DALAND.      Mein Kind, Du siehst mich auf der Schwelle. . .    Wie? kein Umarmen? keinen Kuss?    Du bleibst gebannt an Deiner Stelle. . .    Verdien' ich, Senta, solchen Gruss?          DALAND.          Home again, my child, my darling!        But how is this? No kiss for me?        Why! 'tis a cool reception, sure.      SENTA.      Gott Dir zum Gruss! -- Mein Vater sprich!    Wer ist der Fremde?          SENTA.          Welcome home, my father! But say, speak quick,        Who is this stranger that comes with thee?      DALAND.      Drängst Du mich?      Mögst Du, mein Kind, den fremden Mann willkommen heissen!    Seemann ist er, gleich mir, das Gastrecht spricht er an;    Lang' ohne Heimath, stets auf fernen, weiten Reisen.    In fremden Landen er der Schätze viel gewann.    Aus seinem Vaterland verwiesen,    Für einen Herd er reichlich lohnt;    Sprich, Senta, würd' es Dich verdriessen,    Wenn dieser Fremde bei uns wohnt?          DALAND.          Welcome bid him with all thy heart!          Many a year he sails the sea,        No home is his, no kin his part,          Though rich he is as rich can be.        To him his native land is lost,          And home he seeks, a new home dear;        Come, Senta, come, be thou the host,          And welcome bid the stranger here!      Sagt, hab' ich sie zu viel gepriesen?    Ihr seht sie selbst, -- ist sie Euch recht? --    Soll noch vom Lob ich überfliessen?    Gesteht, sie zieret ihr Geschlecht!    Mögst Du, mein Kind, dem Manne freundlich Dich erweisen!    Von Deinem Herzen auch spricht holde Gab' er an.    Reich' ihm die Hand, denn Bräutigam sollst Du ihn heissen;    Stimmst Du dem Vater bei, ist morgen er Dein Mann.          And you, my new-found friend, say true,          Does she suit to be your wife?        Why should I praise what's only true          And will be blessing all your life?        And thou, my child, be good and true          Give him thy hand and hold him dear,        And, Senta, thou wilt never rue          That I have brought thy husband here.      Sieh' dieses Band, sieh' diese Spangen!    Was er besitzt, macht dies gering.    Muss, theures Kind, Dich's nicht verlangen?    Dein ist es, wechselst Du den Ring?    Doch -- Keines spricht. -- Sollt' ich hier lästig sein?    So ist's! Am besten lass ich sie allein.    Mögst Du den edlen Mann gewinnen!    Glaub' mir, solch Glück wird nimmer neu.    Bleibt hier allein; ich geh' von hinnen.    Glaubt mir, wie schön, so ist sie treu!          See the golden things I've brought--          Quite worthless trifles when compar'd        With the riches in his vessel's hold.          And all his treasures will be shar'd,        All his diamonds and all his gold,          With thee, my child, if thou wilt say        That thou wilt bless him with thy love,          And be his wife without delay;        Wed him, Senta, give him thy love!          I leave thee now alone, my child,        To speak to him as bids thy heart;          I trust in thee, my darling child--        Think how happy will be our part.      HOLLAENDER.      Wie aus der Ferne längst vergang'ner Zeiten    Spricht dieses Mädchens Bild zu mir;    Wie ich geträumt seit langen Ewigkeiten,    Vor meinen Augen seh' ich's hier.    Wohl hob auch ich voll Sehnsucht meine Blicke    Aus tiefer Nacht empor zu einem Weib:    Ein schlagend Herz liess, ach! mir Satans Tücke.    Dass eingedenk ich meiner Qualen bleib'!    Die düst're Gluth, die hier ich fühle brennen,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#5)"],[1," from appealing  to any one of the emotions which we are accustomed to associate with  ourselves, unless our ground for doing so is more than ordinarily  secure. I shall try to show that, in the case of many species, the male  inherits a disposition to secure a territory; or, inasmuch as the word  \"secure\" carries with it too much prospective meaning, a disposition to  remain in a particular place when the appropriate time arrives.    If the part which the breeding territory plays in the sexual life of  birds is the important one I believe it to be, it follows that the  necessary physiological condition must arise at an early stage in the  cycle of events which follow one another in ordered sequence and make  towards the goal of reproduction, and that the behaviour to which it  leads must be one of the earliest visible manifestations of the seasonal  development of the sexual instinct. When does this seasonal development  occur? For how long does the instinct lie dormant? In some species there  is evidence of this first step in the process of reproduction early in  February; there is reason to believe that in others the latter part of  January is the period of revival; and the possibility must not be  overlooked of still earlier awakenings, marked with little definiteness,  though nevertheless of sufficient strength to call into functional  activity the primary impulse in the sexual cycle. Here, then, we meet  with a difficulty so far as direct observation is concerned, for the  duration of the period of dormancy and the precise date of revival vary  in different species; and, if accurate information is to be obtained,  the study of the series of events which culminate in the attainment of  reproduction ought certainly to begin the moment behaviour is  influenced by the internal changes, whatever they may be, which are  responsible for the awakening of the sexual instinct.    In considering how this difficulty might be met, the importance of  migratory species as a channel of information was gradually borne in  upon me; for it seemed that the definiteness with which the initial  stage in the sexual process was marked off, as a result of the incidence  of migration, would go far towards removing much of the obscurity which  appeared to surround the earlier stages of the breeding problem in the  case of resident species. Recent observation has shown that I  exaggerated this difficulty, and that it is generally possible to  determine with reasonable accuracy the approximate date at which the  internal changes begin to exert an influence on the behaviour of  resident species also. Nevertheless, the specialised behaviour of the  migrants furnished a clue, and pointed out the direction which further  inquiry ought to take.    Those who are accustomed to notice the arrival of the migrants are aware  that the woods, thickets, and marshes do not suddenly become occupied by  large numbers of individuals, but that the process of \"filling up\" is a  gradual one. An individual appears here, another there; then after a  pause there is a further addition, and so on with increasing volume  until the tide reaches its maximum, then activity wanes, and the slowly  decreasing number of fresh arrivals passes unnoticed in the wealth of  new life that everywhere forces itself upon our attention. If now,  instead of surveying the migrants as a whole, our attention be directed  to one species only, this gradual arrival of single individuals in their  accustomed haunts will become even more apparent; and if the  investigation be pursued still further and these single individuals  observed more closely, it will be found that in nearly every case they  belong to the male sex. Males therefore arrive before females. This does  not mean, however, that the respective times of arrival of the males and  females belonging to any one species are definitely divided, for males  continue to arrive even after some of the females have reached their  destination; and thus a certain amount of overlapping occurs. A truer  definition of the order of migration would be as follows:--Some males  arrive before others, and some females arrive before others, but on the  average males arrive before females. This fact has long been known.  Gaetke refers to it in his _Birds of Heligoland_. \"Here in Heligoland,\"  he says, \"the forerunners of the spring migration are invariably old  males; a week or two later, solitary old females make their appearance;  and after several weeks, both sexes occur mixed, _i.e._, females and  younger males; while finally only young birds of the previous year are  met with.\" Newton alludes to it as follows:--\"It has been ascertained by  repeated observation that in the spring movement of most species of the  northern hemisphere, the cock birds are always in the van of the  advancing army, and that they appear some days, or perhaps weeks, before  the hens\"; and Dr Eagle Clarke, in his _Studies in Bird Migration_,  makes the following statement:--\"Another characteristic of the spring  is that the males, the more ardent suitors, of most species, travel in  advance of the females, and arrive at their meeting quarters some days,  it is said in some cases even weeks, before their consorts.\" Some  interesting details were given in _British Birds_[1] in regard to the  sex of the migrants that were killed by striking the lantern at the  Tuskar Rock, Co. Wexford, on the 30th April 1914. In all, there were  twenty-four Whitethroats, nine Willow-Warblers, eight Sedge-Warblers,  and six Wheatears; and on dissection it was found that twenty  Whitethroats, seven Willow-Warblers, eight Sedge-Warblers, and one  Wheatear were males.    What a curious departure this seems from the usual custom in the animal  world! Here we have the spectacle afforded us of the males, in whom  presumably the sexual instinct has awakened, deserting the females just  at the moment when we might reasonably expect their impulse to accompany  them would be strongest; and this because of their inherited disposition  to reach the breeding grounds. If, in order to attain to reproduction,  the male depended primarily upon securing a female--whether by winning  or fighting matters not at the moment--if her possession constituted the  sole difference in his external environment between success and failure,  then surely one would suppose that an advantage must rest with those  individuals which, instead of rushing forward and inflicting upon  themselves a life of temporary isolation, remained with the females and  increased their opportunities for developing that mutual appreciation  which, by some, is held to be a necessary prelude to the completion of  the sexual act, and to which close companionship would tend to impart a  stimulus.    In thus speaking, however, we assume that the revival of the sexual  instinct in the migratory male is coincident in time with its return to  the breeding quarters; and we do so because the act of migrating is  believed to be the first step in the breeding process. But it is well to  bear in mind just how much of this assumption is based upon fact, and  how much is due to questionable inference. All that can be definitely  asserted is this, that appropriate dissection reveals in most of the  migrants, upon arrival at their destination, unquestionable evidence of  seasonal increase in the size of the sexual organs. Beyond this there is  nothing to go upon. Yet if the term \"sexual instinct\" is held to  comprise the whole series of complex relationships which are manifest to  us in numerous and specialised modes of behaviour, which ultimately lead  to reproduction, and which have gradually become interwoven in the  tissue of the race, there can be little doubt that the assumption is a  reasonable one. To some, the term may recall the fierce conflicts which  are characteristic of the season; to others, emotional response; to not  a few, perhaps, the actual discharge of the sexual function--all of  these, it is true, are different aspects of the one instinct; but at the  same time each one marks a stage in the process, and the different  stages follow one another in ordered sequence. However, we are not  concerned at the moment with the term in its wider application; we wish  to know the precise stage at which the disposition to mate influences  the behaviour of the male. Is the female to him, from the moment the  seasonal change in his sexual organs takes place, a goal that at all  costs must be attained? Or is it only when the cycle of events which  leads up to reproduction is nearing completion that she looms upon his  horizon? One would like to be in a position to answer these questions,  but there is nothing in the way of experimental evidence to go upon; and  if I say that there is reason to believe that, in the earlier stages,  the female is but a shadow in the external environment of the male, it  must be taken merely as an expression of opinion, though based in some  measure upon a general observation of the behaviour of various species.    Before attempting to explain the difference in the times of arrival of  the male and female migrant, let us examine the behaviour of some  resident species at a corresponding period. My investigations have been  made principally amongst the smaller species--the Finches and the  Buntings--which often pass the winter in or near the localities wherein  they brought up offspring or were reared. It is true that they wander  from one field to another according to the abundance or scarcity of  food; it is also true that, if the weather is of a type which precludes  the possibility of finding the necessary food, these wanderings may  become extensive or even develop into partial migrations. But under the  normal climatic conditions which prevail in many parts of Britain, these  smaller resident species seem to find all that they require without  travelling any great distance from their breeding haunts.
