[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#5)"],[1," poison produced quickly a high degree of paresis of  the nerve and a corresponding engorgement of the veins of the abdomen,  whilst after lethal doses, the paresis culminated in a few minutes in  complete paralysis, followed by rapid collapse, excessive weakness of  the bloodless heart, and death from paralysis of the latter and anaemia  of the nerve-centres. One experiment deserves special record, as it also  shows the untenability of the blood-poison theory.    The whole vascular system of an animal poisoned by intravenous injection  was thoroughly washed out with the warm defibrinised blood of four  animals of the same species, the blood being infused into an external  jugular vein and allowed to flow out of a crural artery. Although blood  exceeding its normal quantity was left in the animal, when the vessels  named were closed, the nerve affection remained unchanged. The blood  pressure raised during the infusion sank at once again to zero, when it  ceased, and the paralysed veins of the abdomen became engorged once  more with the whole, or nearly the whole, of the blood-mass, leaving the  rest of the body anaemic as before. This interesting experiment also  shows how strong a hold the snake-poison has on the nerve-cells when  they are thoroughly under its influence, and how independent this  paralysing action is of the blood, persisting, as it was in this case,  after all the poison had been washed out of the animal.    The heart in vaso-motor paresis and paralysis is weakened in the first  instance by the direct action of the poison on the medulla oblongata and  the intracardiac ganglia. Its pulsations, at first retarded in  frequency, become accelerated soon after the introduction of the poison,  the pulse rate increasing rapidly and the waves becoming smaller and  more easily compressible in proportion to the frequency of the pulse,  which generally counts from 100 to 120 and more per minute at a  comparatively early stage of the poisoning process. But an equally  potent cause of heart failure is its depletion by the simultaneous  stagnation of the blood mass in the veins of the abdomen. Finally, to  complete the mischief, we have not only anaemia of the semi-paralytic  oblongata, but the scanty blood supply this important centre receives  becomes also surcharged with carbonic acid. Oxyhaemaglobin disappears  almost entirely from the blood under the circumstances detailed, as both  pulmonary and internal respiration are greatly interfered with, the  blood tending more and more towards that thin dark condition which it  presents after death, and which has been taken as _prima facie_ evidence  of the direct blood-poisoning action of snake virus by one and all of  previous investigators.    That under the powerful combination of causes, each of which is in  itself sufficient to endanger life, and greatly intensified as paresis  gradually deepens into paralysis, the heart, even of large animals,  succumbs in a comparatively short time, may be readily understood.    The _blood-pressure_, under the circumstances just detailed, must  necessarily be _nil_. Observations by means of the sphygmograph at the  bedside of a person suffering from snake-poison are scarcely feasible,  except, perhaps, in a hospital, and thus far are not on record. We must,  therefore, once more fall back on Feoktistow's experiments, which show  that even the smallest doses (0.02 to 0.04 mllgr.) of the dried poison  _per kilo_ injected into the vein of a cat caused a fall in the  blood-pressure almost immediately, without influencing either pulse or  respiration, but that two to four mgr. were sufficient to reduce the  blood-pressure to zero and bring on collapse, infusions of blood only  raising it temporarily. Of drugs raising the blood-pressure he found  ammonia the most effective, but only after slight doses of the poison;  after lethal ones it had no effect whatever on the blood pressure but  greatly increased the haemorrhagic process in all internal organs. This  important observation should be kept in mind by those who inject  ammonia in serious snakebite cases, and it probably applies likewise to  _the excessive use of alcohol_.    This leads the writer on to the discussion of this singular haemorrhagic  process principally characteristic of viperine poisoning, and only very  exceptionally produced by the poison of colubrines. It is among the  symptoms of snakebite poisoning one of the most interesting ones, but  also one most difficult of explanation. There can be no doubt that it is  produced by vaso-motor paresis and paralysis. We further know that it is  preceded by dilatation of the capillaries and small veins, and that it  is effected principally through the process known as diapedesis, or the  passage of both red and white corpuscles with plasma through the  unruptured capillary membrane, and even the thin one of small veins,  which is nearly of the same structure, being composed of endothelial  cells united by cement. This membrane possesses a certain degree of  porosity, which is probably increased by dilatation. In the absence of  plain muscular fibres contraction and dilatation of the capillaries can  only be effected by a corresponding contraction and expansion of the  nuclei of the endothelial cells. As fibrils derived from non-medullated  nerves terminate in small end-butts in connection with the capillary  membrane, we may assume that the nuclei of the endothelial cells are  under the sway of vaso-motor nerve currents, that weak ones will expand,  strong ones contract them. We may further assume that the red and white  corpuscles force their way out of the vessels through pores in the  cement substance, since a passage of cell through cell is not thinkable.  Thus far we see our way fairly clear. But the question now arises: what  causes the solid constituents of the blood to force their way through  the capillary membranes all over the mucous surfaces, even the  conjunctiva, and not these alone, but also through serous membranes such  as the pericardium, and strangest of all, through old scars in the skin?  If the most modern ideas as to the cause of diapedesis being blood  pressure are correct, it is quite incomprehensible how it can take place  in the absence of blood pressure, and take place so extensively. The  theory of blood pressure may apply to diapedesis accompanying the  inflammatory process. In snakebite poisoning it is more likely to be due  to passive engorgement of the capillary system and probably also to  blockage of corpuscles in the finest capillary tubes. In vaso-motor  paresis, and still more paralysis, the arterioles supplying the  capillaries are widely dilated, and at the lowest blood pressure  probably send more blood into the latter than in the normal state. This  circumstance in itself is apt to cause capillary engorgement. In the  finest capillaries permitting only a string of corpuscles, one behind  the other but none abreast, to pass through in the normal state,  dilatation may cause blockage by two or three becoming wedged in abreast  and closing the lumen of the vessel by a sort of embolism. On the  arterial side of this obstruction the crowded corpuscles force their way  through the porous cement substance by what little \"vis a tergo\" there  may be left yet, whilst in the venous side, in the small veins  corresponding with the closed capillaries, engorgement must necessarily  take place through this \"vis a tergo\" being entirely absent, and  diapedesis, which here also has been observed, follow in due course. The  writer has always been inclined to take this view, the correctness of  which appears to be borne out by an experiment recorded by Feoktistow.  He found on sprinkling a two per cent. solution of snake-poison over the  mesentery of an healthy animal, that wherever a drop of the solution  fell, almost immediately the capillaries and small veins became dilated  and small point-like effusions of blood appeared, gradually enlarging  and ultimately becoming confluent with adjoining ones. Large haemorrhagic  surfaces were thus formed in a comparatively short time. Here paralysis  of the nerve-cells interspersed in the vaso-motor nerve-ends was  evidently the first effect, followed by dilatation of the capillaries  and immediately afterwards by effusion. Without some obstruction within  the capillaries, like that above described, effusion in this purely  local poisoning process appears unexplainable.    The special preference which the viper-poison has for the vaso-motor  sphere will hereafter be referred to. Haemorrhages from Australian  snake-poison are comparatively rare. Even at the bitten place there is  as a rule very little swelling and effusion and frequently none at all.  When it occurs it quickly disappears after strychnine injections. Only  a few cases have been reported as yet of blood-vomiting. In one of these  the haemorrhage took place soon after the bite and was so considerable  that it must have arisen from actual rupture of vessels consequent on  abdominal engorgement and not from mere diapedesis. It is very doubtful  whether the latter ever takes place here as it does after viper-bite in  India and elsewhere. Even the death-adder, although half a viper, and  producing more swelling and effusion locally than any other one of our  snakes, is not known to have ever produced the extensive effusions from  mucous surfaces in pericardium, lungs, &c., described above. More  research however is necessary, especially more carefully conducted  autopsies. Since Australia has taken the lead in this hitherto so  obscure department, every practitioner should make it his object and  special ambition to contribute his quota towards the elucidation of the  subject, not only by reporting successful cases, but also the  post-mortem appearances in unsuccessful ones, wherever it is  practicable.

And patches are not  too difficult a maneuver.    [Sidenote: Moleskin and Khaki]    The almost universal wear in the West is the copper-riveted blue canvas  overall. They are very good in that they wear well. Otherwise they are  stiff and noisy in the brush. Kersey is excellent where much wading is  to be done or much rainy weather encountered--in fact it is the favorite  \"driving\" trousers with rivermen--but like all woven woolen materials  it \"picks out\" in bad brush. Corduroy I would not have as a gift. It is  very noisy, and each raindrop that hits it spreads at once to the size  of a silver dollar. I verily believe an able pair of corduroys can, when  feeling good, soak up ten pounds of water. Good moleskin dries well, and  until it begins to give out is soft and tough. But it is like the  one-hoss shay: when it starts to go, it does the job up completely in a  few days. The difficulty is to guess when that moment is due to arrive.  Anything but the best quality is worthless. Khaki has lately come into  popularity. It wears remarkably well, dries quickly, and is excellent in  all but one particular: it shows every spot of dirt. A pair of khakis  three days along on the trail look as though they had been out a year.  The new green khaki is a little better. Buckskin is all right until you  get it wet, then you have--temporarily--enough material to make three  pairs and one for the boy.    The best trousers I know of is a combination of the latter two  materials. I bought a pair of the ordinary khaki army riding breeches,  and had a tailor cover them completely--fore, aft, and sideways--with  some good smoke-tanned buckskin I happened to have. It took a skin and a  half. These I have worn now for three seasons, in all kinds of country,  in all kinds of weather, and they are to-day as good as when I  constructed them. In still hunting they are noiseless; horseback they do  not chafe; in cold weather they are warm, and the hot sun they turn. The  khaki holds the stretch of buckskin when wet--as they have been for a  week at a time. Up to date the smoke tan has dried them soft. Altogether  they are the most satisfactory garment of this kind I have experimented  with.    There remains the equally important subject of footwear.    [Sidenote: Socks]    Get heavy woolen lumberman's socks, and wear them in and out of season.  They are not one whit hotter on the feet than the thinnest you can buy,  for the impervious leather of the shoe is really what keeps in the  animal heat--the sock has little to do with it. You will find the soft  thick wool an excellent cushion for a long tramp; and with proper care  to avoid wrinkles, you will never become tender-footed nor chafed. At  first it seems ridiculous to draw on such thick and apparently hot socks  when the sun peeping over the rim of the desert promises you a scorching  day. Nothing but actual experience will convince you; but I am sure that  if you will give the matter a fair test, you will come inevitably to my  conclusion.    [Sidenote: The Ideal Footwear]    If a man were limited to a choice between moccasins and shoes, it would  be very difficult to decide wisely which he should take. Each has its  manifest advantages over the other, and neither can entirely take the  place of the other.    The ideal footwear should give security, be easy on the feet, wear well,  and give absolute protection. These qualities I have named approximately  in the order of their importance.    [Sidenote: Security of footing]    Security of footing depends on the nature of the ground over which you  are traveling. Hobnails only will hold you on a slope covered with pine  needles, for instance; both leather and buckskin there become as  slippery as glass. In case of smooth rocks, however, your hobnails are  positively dangerous, as they slide from under you with all the vicious  force and suddenness of unaccustomed skates. Clean leather is much  better, and buckskin is the best of all. Often in hunting deer along the  ledges of the deep box canyons I, with my moccasins, have walked  confidently up slants of smooth rock on which my hobnailed companion was  actually forced to his hands and knees. Undoubtedly also a man carrying  a pack through mixed forest is surer of his footing and less liable to  turned ankles in moccasins than in boots. My experience has been that  with the single exception mentioned, I have felt securer in the  buckskin.    [Illustration:              \"Mountain on mountain towering high,             And a valley in between\"]    [Sidenote: Ease]    As for ease to the feet, that is of course a matter of opinion.  Undoubtedly at first the moccasin novice is literally a tenderfoot. But  after astonishingly few days of practice a man no longer notices the  lack of a sole. I have always worn moccasins more or less in the woods,  and now can walk over pebbles or knife-edge stones without the slightest  discomfort. In fact the absence of rolling and slipping in that sort of  shifting footing turns the scale quite the other way.    [Sidenote: Wear]    The matter of wear is not so important. It would seem at first glance  that the one thin layer of buckskin would wear out before the several  thick layers of a shoe's sole. Such is not always the case. A good deal  depends on the sort of ground you cover. If you wet moccasins, and then  walk down hill with them over granite shale, you can get holes to order.  Boots wear rapidly in the same circumstances. On the other hand I have  on at this moment a pair of mooseskin moccasins purchased three years  ago at a Hudson's Bay Company's post, which have seen two summers' off  and on service in the Sierras. Barring extraordinary conditions, I  should say that each in its proper use, a pair of boots and a pair of  moccasins would last about the same length of time. The moccasin,  however, has this advantage: it can be readily patched, and even a half  dozen extra pairs take up little room in the pack.    [Sidenote: Waterproofing]    Absolute protection must remain a tentative term. No footwear I have  succeeded in discovering gives absolute protection. Where there is much  work to be done in the water, I think boots are the warmest and most  comfortable, though no leather is perfectly waterproof. Moccasins then  become slimpsy, stretched, and loathsome. So likewise moccasins are not  much good in damp snow, though in dry snow they are unexcelled.    In my own practice I wear boots on a horseback trip, and carry moccasins  in my pack for general walking. In the woods I pack four pair of  moccasins. In a canoe, moccasins of course.    [Sidenote: About Boots]    Do not make the common mistake of getting tremendously heavy boots.  They are clumsy to place, burdensome to carry, and stiff and unpliable  to the chafing point. The average amateur woodsman seems to think a pair  of elephantine brogans is the proper thing--a sort of badge of  identification in the craft. If he adds big hobnails to make tracks  with, he is sure of himself. A medium weight boot, of medium height,  with medium heavy soles armed only with the small Hungarian hobnail is  about the proper thing. Get them eight inches high; supplied with very  large eyelets part way, then the heaviest hooks, finishing with two more  eyelets at the top. The latter will prevent the belt-lacing you will use  as shoestrings from coming unhooked.    You will see many advertisements of waterproof leather boots. No such  thing is made. Some with good care will exclude water for a while, if  you stay in it but a few minutes at a time, but sooner or later as the  fibers become loosened the water will penetrate. In the case of the show  window exhibit of the shoe standing in a pan of water, pressure of the  foot and ground against the leather is lacking, which of course makes  all the difference. This porosity is really desirable. A shoe wholly  waterproof would retain and condense the perspiration to such an extent  that the feet would be as wet at the end of the day. Such is the case  with rubber boots. All you want is a leather that will permit you to  splash through a marsh, a pool, or a little stream, and will not seek to  emulate blotting paper in its haste to become saturated.    [Sidenote: The Most Durable Boots]    Of the boots I have tried, and that means a good many, I think the  Putman boot and the river driver's boot, made by A. A. Cutter of Eau  Claire, Wis., are made of the most durable material. The Putman boot is  the more expensive; and in the case of the three pairs I know of  personally, the sewing has been defective. The material, however, wears  remarkably well, and remains waterproof somewhat longer than any of the  others. On the other hand the Cutter shoe is built primarily for  rivermen and timber cruisers of the northern forests, and is at once  cheap and durable. It has a brace of sole leather about the heel which  keeps the latter upright and prevents it running over. It is an easier  shoe on the foot than any of the others, but does not remain waterproof  quite so long as the Putman. Although, undoubtedly, many other makes are  as good, you will not go astray in purchasing one of these two.    [Sidenote: Rubber]    No shoe is waterproof for even a short time in wet snow. Rubber is then  the only solution, usually in the shape of a shoe rubber with canvas  tops. Truth to tell, melting snow is generally so very cold that you  will be little troubled with interior condensation. Likewise many years'  experience in grouse hunting through the thickets and swamps of Michigan  drove me finally to light hip rubber boots. The time was always the  autumn; the place was always more or less muddy and wet--in spots of  course--and there was always the greater or lesser possibility of snow.  My native town was a great grouse shooting center, and all hunters, old  and young, came to the same conclusion.    But wet snow, such hunting, and of course the duck marsh, seem"]]]
