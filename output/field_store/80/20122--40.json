You guess by this time that she gave me  tidings of you, that she is a delightful and enchanting person,  that she makes admirable portraits, and that mine, amongst  others, has been a wonderful success. Etc., etc., and always  etc...    And yet I do wish to talk to you about this good Mademoiselle  Merienne, for she said a heap of charming things to me for your  sake, which will certainly not astonish you. But how to set about  it after all this preamble of parentheses? Ah, I have it!--In  three or four weeks I shall come and knock at your door.--And  then? Well, then we will chatter away at our ease. So much the  worse for you if you are not satisfied with my cunning stratagem.  Now let us talk business; yes, seriously, let us talk business!    Has your brother returned from his journey? And is he well? And  has no accident happened to him on the way? You are surprised,  perhaps, at my anxiety; but by-and-bye you will understand it  without difficulty, when I have explained to you how terribly  interested I am in the fact of his journey being safely  accomplished.    Just imagine that at this moment I have only 200 fr. in my purse  (a ridiculously small sum for a traveler), and that it is M. Pavy  who is to be my financial Providence, considering that it is to  him that my mother has confided my little quarterly income of a  thousand francs. Now at this point I must entrust you with a  little secret, which at present is only known to two individuals,  Messrs. Paccard and Roger (charming names for confidants, are not  they?), and which I beg you to make known as quickly as possible  to your brother. It concerns a little scrap of paper (which these  rogues of bankers call a draft, I believe), for a thousand  francs, by which Messrs. Paccard and Roger are authorized by my  signature, which is at the bottom, to demand the above sum of a  thousand francs (which my mother entrusted to M. Pavy in Paris)  from M. Pavy, junior, living at La Glaciere at Lyons, after the  22nd of August, 1836.    A thousand pardons for troubling you with these details, but I  should never have had the courage to write direct to your  brother, on account of my profound ignorance in money matters.    You tell me that you passed part of the fine season in the  country--why did not you arrange so as to tour for a little among  the mountains of Switzerland? I should have had such pleasure in  doing the honors, and Mademoiselle Merienne also...but don't let  us speak any more of Mademoiselle Merienne (who, be it observed  in parenthesis, must have already appeared a dozen times in this  letter), for fear of again falling into inextricable parentheses.    Au revoir then; in five weeks at latest I shall come and warm  myself at your \"glacier.\"    F. Liszt        11. To Abbe de Lamennais    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.]    My friend Louis de Ronchaud writes me word that he has had the  honor of seeing you, dear Father, and that you were kind enough  to give him a message of affectionate remembrance for me. I am  very happy to know that you continue to keep this precious and  friendly feeling for me, of which you have already given me so  many proofs, and which I shall endeavour always to deserve as far  as is in my power.    I am still not very far advanced in my Italian journey. The  beauty of these parts, the necessity of writing with some little  continuance, and also, if all be said, some altogether unexpected  successes, have kept me in Milan and the neighborhood (Como and  the delicious shores of the lake) much longer than I had  foreseen. As regards musical matters, the presence of Rossini,  whom I frequently see, gives a certain impetus to this country. I  have been singularly well received here, so I shall probably pass  the greater part of the winter here, and shall not start for  Venice till towards the beginning of March. Thence I shall go to  Florence and Rome, where I expect I shall stay a good long time.    D. has no doubt talked to you of our stay at Nohant last summer.  I think that he got rid there of a good many old prejudices about  me. It was a sweet satisfaction to me to learn through him how  good and indulgent you have been towards me on several occasions,  even so far as to contradict and defend me warmly against him and  against others who knew me still less. I had charged our secret  friend to defend me in his turn from a slight wrong which I had,  only apparently, committed, but even \"apparently\" is too much,  and I think I have entirely justified myself with regard to it. I  don't know whether in his noble carelessness he will have thought  of it. However that may be, I shall always count on your paternal  affection more than all the rest.    What can I say to you of Italy that you do not know, and that you  have not said in such manner as to cause despair for ever to the  makers of observations!--It is always the same status quo, the  excellent and perfectly happy government that you know.--I am  hoping and longing ardently for your next book [probably \"Le  Livre du Peuple\": Paris, 1837], which I shall read with my whole  heart and soul, as I have read all that you have written for four  years. I shall owe you just so many more good and noble emotions.  Will they remain for ever sterile? Will my life be for ever  tainted with this idle uselessness which weighs upon me? Will the  hour of devotion and of manly action never come? Am I condemned  without respite to this trade of a Merry Andrew and to amuse in  drawing-rooms?    Whatever may be my poor and humble destiny, do not ever doubt my  heart. Do not ever doubt the deep respect and unalterable  devotion with which you have inspired me.    Yours for ever,    F. Liszt    Como, December 18th, 1837        12. To Breitkopf and Hartel in Leipzig    [Autograph in the possession of Herr Hermann Scholtz,  Kammervirtuoso in Dresden.]    I thank you much, gentlemen, for the obliging letter that you  have written me. Up to the present time I have had none but the  most pleasant business relations with Mr. Hofmeister, who has the  kindness to publish the greater part of my works in Germany. As I  do not know very much of the laws which regulate literary and  musical proprietorship in Saxony, I had spoken to him about the  Beethoven Symphonies, of which I have undertaken the arrangement,  or, more correctly speaking, the pianoforte score. To tell the  truth, this work has, nevertheless, cost me some trouble; whether  I am right or wrong, I think it sufficiently different from, not  to say superior to, those of the same kind which have hitherto  appeared. The recent publication of the same Symphonies, arranged  by Mr. Kalkbrenner, makes me anxious that mine should not remain  any longer in a portfolio. I intend also to finger them  carefully, which, in addition to the indication of the different  instruments (which is important in this kind of work), will most  certainly make this edition much more complete. If, then, as I  imagine, it is impossible for Mr. Hofmeister to publish them, I  shall be very grateful if you will undertake it. The reputation  of your house is European, and I perfectly remember having had  the pleasure of seeing Mr. Raymond Hartel in Paris. It will be a  pleasure to me to conclude this little business with you, at the  rate of eight francs a page. Up to the present time I have only  finished three Symphonies (that in A major), but I could promise  to let you have the others successively, according as you might  wish, or I could limit my work to the four most important  Symphonies (if I may express my opinion), namely, the Pastoral, C  minor, A major, and the Eroica. I think those are the ones which  are most effective on the piano.    I start tomorrow for Vienna, where I expect to remain till the  end of April. Please address to me to the care of Mr. Tobias  Haslinger till the 25th of April, and after that to Mr. Ricordi,  Milan, who has undertaken to forward me all my letters while I am  in Italy. My compliments and affectionate thanks.    F. Liszt        13. To Robert Schumann    [Addressed to the celebrated German Tone-poet (1810-1856). Liszt  had spoken of Schumann's Op. 5, 11, and 14 in the Gazette  Musicale, 1837, with equal enthusiasm and understanding, which  soon brought the two together.]    [Without a date; received by R. S. May 5th, 1838.]    My dear Monsieur Schumann,    I shall not attempt to tell you how grateful and touched I am by  your friendly letter. Mademoiselle Wieck, whom I have been so  happy as to meet here, will express to you, better than I can,  all the sympathy, all the admiring affection I have for you. I  have been such a nomad latterly that the pieces you were kind  enough to address to me at Milan only reached me on the eve of my  departure from Venice about a fortnight ago; and since then we  have been talking so much of you, day and night, that it hardly  occurred to me to write to you. Today, however, to my great  astonishment, I get a fresh token of your friendly remembrance,  and I certainly will not delay thanking you many times for it, so  I have just left a charming party of very pretty women in order  to write these few lines to you. But the truth is you need hardly  thank me for this little sacrifice, for it is a great pleasure to  me to be able to have a little chat with you.    The \"Carneval\" and the \"Fantasiestucke\" have interested me  excessively. I play them really with delight, and God knows that  I can't say as much of many things. To speak frankly and freely,  it is absolutely only Chopin's compositions and yours that have a  powerful interest for me.    The rest do not deserve the honor of being mentioned...at least,  with a few exceptions,--to be conciliatory, like Eusebius.    In "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],[0,"Marvels of Pond-life (#5)"],[1," can any mouth be discerned, and their antics,  although energetic and comical, afford no certain indications of either  purpose or will. What are they? animals or vegetables? or something  betwixt and between?    The first impression of any casual observer would be to declare in  favour of their animality; but before this can be settled, comes the  question, what is an animal, and how does it differ from a vegetable?  and upon this the learned do by no means agree. One writer considers the  presence of _starch_ in any object a proof that it belongs to the  dominions of Flora, while another would decide the issue by ascertaining  whether it evolves oxygen and absorbs carbon, as most plants do, or  whether it evolves carbon and absorbs oxygen, as _decided_ animals do.  Dr. Carpenter asserts that the distinction between _Protophyta_ and  _Protozoa_ (first or simplest plants and animals), \"lies in the nature  of their food, and the method of its introduction, for whilst the  _Protophyte_ obtains the materials of its nutrition from the air and  moisture that surround it, and possesses the power of detaching oxygen,  hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen from their previous binary combinations,  and of uniting them into ternary and quaternary organic compounds  (chlorophyll, starch, albumen, &c.), the simplest _Protozoa_, in common  with the highest members of the animal kingdom, seems utterly destitute  of any such power, makes, so to speak, a stomach for itself in the  substance of its body, into which it injects the solid particles that  constitute its food, and within which it subjects them to a regular  process of digestion.\"    Unfortunately it is very difficult to apply this simple theory to the  dubious objects which lie on the border-land of the animal world, and no  other theory that has been propounded appears to meet all cases. Some  naturalists do not expect to find a broad line of demarkation between  the two great divisions of living things, but others characterise such  an idea as \"unphilosophical,\" in spite of which, however, we incline  towards it.    Mr. Gosse, whose opinion is entitled to great respect, calls the  _Euglenae_ \"animals\" in his 'Evenings with the Microscope;' but from the  aggregate of recorded observations it seems that they evolve oxygen, are  coloured with the colouring matter of plants, reproduce their species in  a manner analogous to plants, and have in some cases been clearly traced  to the vegetable world. It is, however, possible that some _Euglenae_  forms may be animal and others vegetable, and while their place at  nature's table is being decided, they must be content to be called  _Phytozoa_, which, as we have before explained, is merely _Zoophyte_  turned upside down.    Some authorities have thought their animality proved by the high degree  of contractility which their tissues evince. This, however, cannot go  for much, as all physiologists admit contractility to belong to the  vegetable tissues of the sensitive plant, \"Venus' Fly-trap,\" &c., and a  little more or less cannot mark the boundary between two orders of  being.    We shall have occasion again to notice the _Protophytes_, and now pass  to the _Protozoa_, of which we have a good illustration in the  _Vorticella_ already spoken of. In the group before us a number of  elegant bells or vases stand at the end of long stalks, as shown at the  top of the frontispiece, while round the tops of the bells, the  vibrations of a wreath or cilia produce little vortices or whirlpools,  and hence comes the family name. This current brings particles of all  sorts to the mouth near the rim of the bells, and the creature seems not  entirely destitute of power to choose or reject the morsels according to  its taste. Every now and then the stalk of some specimen is suddenly  twisted into a spiral, and contracted, so as to bring the bell almost to  the ground. Then the stem gracefully elongates again, and the cilia  repeat their lively game.    The general effect can be seen very well by a power of about sixty  linear, but one of them from one to two hundred is necessary to bring  out the details, and a practised observer will use still more  magnification with good effect. They should be examined by a moderately  oblique light, or most of the cilia are apt to be rendered invisible,  and also by _dark ground_ illumination. This may be accomplished in a  well-made microscope by turning the mirror quite out of the plane of the  axis of the instrument, that is to say, on one side of the space the  body would occupy if it were prolonged. By this means, and by placing  the lamp at an angle with the mirror, that must be learnt by experiment,  all the light that reaches the eye has first passed through the object,  and is refracted by it out of the line it was taking, which would have  carried it entirely away. Or the object may be illuminated by an  apparatus called a _spotted lens_, which is a small bull's-eye placed  under the stage, and having all the centre of its face covered with a  plaster of black silk. In this method the central or direct rays from  the mirror are obstructed, but those which strike the edge of the  bull's-eye are bent towards the object, which they penetrate and  illuminate if it is sufficiently transparent and refractive. Another  mode of dark ground illumination is by employing an elegant instrument  called a _parabolic illuminator_, which need not be described.    [Illustration: Vorticella, with posterior circlet of cilia in process of  separation, 300 linear.--_Stein._]    [Illustration: Vorticella in process of self-division. A new frontal  wreath in formation in each of the semi-lunar spaces.]    Different specimens and species of _Vorticellae_ vary in the length of  their bells from one three or four thousandth to one hundred and  twentieth of an inch, and when they are tolerably large, the dark ground  illumination produces a beautiful effect. The bells shine with a pearly  iridescent lustre, and their cilia flash with brilliant prismatic  colours.    [Illustration: Vorticella microstoma, showing alimentary tube, ciliated  mouth, and formation of a gemma at the base, 300 linear.--_Stein._]    [Illustration: Vorticella microstoma, the encysted animal protruding  through a supposed rupture of the tunic.]    The _Vorticellina_ belong to the upper division of the _Protozoa_--the  _ciliata_, or ciliated animalcules, and they have a mouth, an  oesophagus, and an orifice for the exit of their food.    Many observers used to ascribe to those creatures a complete intestinal  canal, but such an apparatus is now believed not to exist in any of the  Infusoria. Food particles, after leaving the oesophagus, are thrust  forward into the sarcode, or soft flesh, and any cavity thus formed acts  as a stomach.    The bells or cups are not, as might be fancied from a casual inspection,  open like wineglasses at the top, but furnished with a retractile disk  or cover, on which the cilia are arranged. Their stalks are not simple  stems, but are hollow tubes, which in the genus Vorticella are furnished  with a muscular band, by whose agency the movements are principally  made.    Some of the Vorticellids will be observed to leave their stalks, having  developed cilia round their base, and may be seen to swim about in the  enjoyment of individual life. They are also capable of becoming  _encysted_, that is, of secreting a gelatinous cover.    [Illustration: Encysted Vorticella, showing the obliteration of special  organs by the advancement of the process.--_Pritchard._]    These changes are exhibited in the annexed cuts, which are copied from  known authorities. By careful observation of the bodies of Vorticellids,  a contractile vesicle may be observed, which appears to cause a movement  of fluids, that is probably connected either with respiration or  secretion.    Another piece of apparatus in this family, but not confined to it, is  the so-called _nucleus_, which in this case is of a horseshoe shape and  granular texture, and greater solidity than the surrounding parts. The  functions of this organ formed the subject of various conjectures, but  it is now generally held to be an ovary.    [Illustration: Vorticella microstoma, in process of encystment, 300  linear; in the last the inclosing tunic is plainly developed.--_Stein._]    In common with many of the lower animals, the Vorticellids have three  ways of multiplying their race. One by _fission_, or division of their  bodies: another by _buds_, somewhat analogous to those of plants; and  another by reproductive germs. These processes will come again under our  notice, and we shall leave the Vorticellids for the present by observing  that if they are fed with a very small quantity of indigo or carmine,  the vacuoles or spaces, into which their nutriment passes, will be  clearly observed. Ehrenberg thought in these and similar creatures that  every vacuole was a distinct stomach, and that all the stomachs were  connected by an intestinal canal; hence his name _Polygastrica_, or  many stomached. In these views he has not been followed by later  observers, and it is probable he was misled, partly by pushing the  process of reasoning from the analogies of higher animals much too far,  and partly by the imperfection of the glasses he employed.    [Illustration: Rotifer vulgaris.--A, mouth, or gizzard; B, contractile  vesicle.--_Micrographic Dictionary._ N.B.--When the cilia and tail part  are retracted, and the body shortened, the creature assumes an obtuse  oval form.]    Having thus briefly considered the Vorticellids we must turn to the  wheel-bearer, who belongs to a higher race than even the ciliated  _Protozoa_. We left her crawling about with her snout or proboscis  protruded, but now she has moored herself by her tail-foot, pulled in  her nose, and put out two groups of cilia, which look like revolving  wheels, and a little below them is seen a gizzard in a state of"]]]
