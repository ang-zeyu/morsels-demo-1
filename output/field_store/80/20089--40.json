After each  fresh conquest, the Aztecs raised a temple at Mexico bearing the name of  the conquered country, and thither they transported natives of the place  to carry on the worship after their own customs. It seems that they did  not consider even this precaution enough; for they constructed a special  edifice near the great temple of Mexico, where the supreme deities of  the Aztec people were enthroned, and there they shut up the idols of the  conquered countries. This was to prevent their escape, should the desire  come over them to return to their own peoples and help them to  revolt.[5]    All this will explain how it was that Fernando Cortes found numerous  allies against Montezuma's despotism amongst the native peoples. For it  is an error, generally received indeed, but contradicted by history,  that the Spanish captain decided the fate of so redoubtable an empire,  and of a city so vigorously defended as Mexico, with the sole aid of his  thousand Europeans.    For the rest, we are forced to acknowledge that the Aztecs had developed  their civilization, in its political and material aspects, in a way that  does the greatest credit to their sagacity. Property was organized on  the individual and hereditary basis for the noble families, and on the  collective basis for the people, divided into communities. The taxes  were raised in kind, according to fixed rules. Numbers of slaves were  charged with the most laborious kinds of work. The merchants, assembled  in the cities, formed a veritable _tiers-etat_ which exercised a growing  political influence. There were markets, the abundance and wealth of  which stupefied the Spaniards. The luxury of the court and of the great  families was dazzling. No one dared to address the sovereign save with  lowered voice, and--strange custom in our eyes!--no one appeared before  him save with naked feet and clad in sordid garments, in sign of  humility. Mexico had been joined to the mainland by causeways, along  which an aqueduct conveyed the pure waters of distant springs to the  city. The irrigation works in the country were numerous and in good  repair. The streets were cleansed by day and lighted at night,  advantages in which none of the European capitals rejoiced in the  sixteenth century. And finally, for we cannot dwell indefinitely upon  this subject, let us note the excellent roads that stretched from Mexico  to the limits of the Aztec empire and the confederated states. Along  these roads the sovereigns of Mexico had established, at intervals of  two leagues, courier posts for the transmission of important news to  them. Montezuma heard of the disembarkment of Fernando Cortes three days  after it took place.    And now imagine that this people was always averse to navigation--was  ignorant of use of iron, knowing only of gold, silver and copper--had no  beast of traction or burden, neither horse, nor ass, nor camel, nor  elephant, nor even the llama of Peru--was without writing (for though we  find a kind of hieroglyph on the monuments of Mexico and Central  America, yet the system was not of the smallest avail for ordinary  life)--and, finally, had no money except an inconsiderable number of  silver crosses and cacao berries, the mass of exchanges being effected  by barter! On the other hand, they worked in stone with admirable skill.  In their knives and lance and arrow heads, made of obsidian, they  achieved remarkable perfection, and they excelled in the art of  supplying the place of writing by pictures, painted on a kind of aloe  paper or on cotton stuffs, representing the persons or things as to  which they desired to convey information.    Such, then, is the singular people that Spain was destined to conquer in  the sixteenth century, and whose civilization, though modified by the  special Aztec spirit, rested after all upon the same bases that had  sustained the more ancient civilization of Central America. And this is  equally true of the religion, which, with all the varieties impressed  upon it by the special genius or inclinations of the diverse peoples,  reveals itself as resting upon one common basis, from the Isthmus of  Panama to the Gulf of California and the mouths of the Rio del Norte.      IV.    One of the fundamental traits of this regional religion, then, is the  pre-eminence of the Sun, regarded as a personal and animated being, over  all other divinities. At Guatemala, amongst the Lacandones, he was  adored directly, without any images. Amongst their neighbours the Itzas,  not far from Vera Paz, he was represented as a round human head  encircled by diverging rays and with a great open mouth. This symbol,  indeed, was very widely spread in all that region. Often the Sun is  represented putting out his tongue, which means that he lives and  speaks. For in the American hieroglyphics, a protruded tongue, or a  tongue placed by the side of any object, is the emblem of life. A  mountain with a tongue represents a volcano. The Sun was generally  associated with the Moon as spouse, and they were called _Grandfather_  and _Grandmother_. In Central America, and in the territory of Mexico,  may be observed a number of stone columns which are likewise statues;  but the head is generally in the middle, and is so overlaid with  ornaments or attributes, that it is not very easy to discover it. These  are _Sun-columns_. As he traced the shadow of these monoliths upon the  soil day after day, the Sun appeared to be caressing them, loving them,  taking them as his fellow-workers in measuring the time. These same  columns were also symbols of fructifying power. Often the Sun has a  child, who is no other than a doublet of himself, but conceived in human  form as the civilizer, legislator and conqueror, bearing diverse names  according to the peoples whose hero-god and first king he is represented  as being. And for that matter, if we had but the time, we might long  dwell on the myths of Yucatan, of Guatemala (amongst the Quiches), of  Honduras, and of Nicaragua. By the side of the Sun and Moon, grandfather  and grandmother, there were a number of great and small deities (some of  them extremely vicious), and amongst others a god of rain, who was  called Tohil by the Quiches and Tlaloc at Mexico, where he took his  place amongst the most revered deities. His name signifies \"noise,\"  \"rumbling.\" Amongst the Quiches he had a great temple at Utatlan,  pyramidal in form, like all others in this region of the world, where he  was the object of a \"perpetual adoration\" offered him by groups of from  thirteen to eighteen worshippers, who relieved each other in relays day  and night.    Human sacrifice was practised by all these peoples, though not to such  an extent as amongst the Aztecs, for they only resorted to it on rare  occasions. It was especially girls that they immolated, with the idea of  giving brides to the gods. They were to exercise their conjugal  influence in favourably disposing their divine consorts towards the  sacrificers. In this connection we find a tragi-comic story of a young  victim whose forced marriage was not in the least to her taste, and who  threatened to pronounce the most terrible maledictions from heaven upon  her slaughterers. Her threats had so much effect that they let her go,  and procured another and less recalcitrant bride for the deity.[6]    Finally, we will mention a most characteristic deity (whom we shall  presently recognize at Mexico under yet another name), variously known  as Cuculkan (bird-serpent), Gucumatz (feathered-serpent),  Hurakan--whence our \"hurricane\"--Votan (serpent), &c. He is always a  serpent, and generally feathered or flying. He is a personification of  the wind, especially of the east wind, which brings the fertilizing  rains in that district. Almost everywhere he is credited with gentle and  beneficent dispositions, and therefore with a certain hostility to human  sacrifice. It was this deity, in one of his forms, who was worshipped in  the sacred island of Cozumel, situated close to Yucatan, to which  pilgrimages were made from great distances. It was there that the  Spaniards, to their great surprise, first observed a cross surmounting  the temple of this god of the wind. This was the starting-point of the  legend according to which the Apostle Thomas had of old evangelized  America. It is a pure illusion. The pagan cross of Central America and  Mexico is nothing whatever but the symbol of the four cardinal points of  the compass from which blow the four chief winds.    Such is the common religious basis, which we have simply sketched in its  most general outlines, and upon which the more elaborate and sombre  religion of the Aztecs, which we shall examine at our next meeting, was  reared. Pray observe that we find in this group of connected beliefs and  worships something quite analogous to the polytheism of the ancient  world. The only notable difference is, that the god of Heaven, Dyaus,  Varuna, Zeus, Ahura Mazda, or (in China) Tien, does not occupy the same  pre-eminent place in the American mythology that he takes in its  European and Asiatic counterparts. For the rest, the processes of the  human spirit are absolutely identical in the two continents. In both  alike it is the phenomena of nature, regarded as animated and conscious,  that wake and stimulate the religious sentiment and become the objects  of the adoration of man. At the same time, and in virtue of the same  process of internal logic, these personified beings come to be regarded  more and more as possessed of a nature superior in power indeed, but in  all other respects closely conforming, to that of man. If  nature-worship, with the animism that it engenders, shapes the first  law to which nascent religion submits in the human race,  anthropomorphism furnishes the second, disengaging itself ever more and  more completely from the zoomorphism which generally serves as an  intermediary.

They are the same when a star  is rising and when it is setting; when it is above the pole and when it  is below it. During each day the hour circle of every star in the  heavens passes overhead, and at the moment when any particular hour  circle is exactly overhead all the stars which lie upon it are said to  be \"on the meridian\"--i. e., at that particular moment they stand  directly over the observer's geographical meridian and upon the  corresponding celestial meridian.    An eye placed at the center of the earth and capable of looking through  its solid substance would see your geographical meridian against the  background of the sky exactly covering your celestial meridian and  passing from one pole through your zenith to the other pole. In Fig. 11  the inner circle represents the terrestrial meridian of a certain  place, _O_, as seen from the center of the earth, _C_, and the outer  circle represents the celestial meridian of _O_ as seen from _C_, only  we must imagine, what can not be shown on the figure, that the outer  circle is so large that the inner one shrinks to a mere point in  comparison with it. If _C P_ represents the direction in which the  earth's axis passes through the center, then _C E_ at right angles to it  must be the direction of the equator which we suppose to be turned  edgewise toward us; and if _C O_ is the direction of some particular  point on the earth's surface, then _Z_ directly overhead is called the  _zenith_ of that point, upon the celestial sphere. The line _C H_  represents a direction parallel to the horizon plane at _O_, and _H C P_  is the angle which the axis of the earth makes with this horizon plane.  The arc _O E_ measures the latitude of _O_, and the arc _Z E_ measures  the declination of _Z_, and since by elementary geometry each of these  arcs contains the same number of degrees as the angle _E C Z_, we have  the    _Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the declination of its  zenith.    _Corollary._--Any star whose declination is equal to your latitude will  once in each day pass through your zenith.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Reference lines and circles.]    18. LATITUDE.--From the construction of the figure        [angle] _E C Z_ + [angle] _Z C P_ = 90°      [angle] _H C P_ + [angle] _Z C P_ = 90°    from which we find by subtraction and transposition        [angle] _E C Z_ = [angle] _H C P_    and this gives the further    _Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the elevation of the  pole above its horizon plane.    An observer who travels north or south over the earth changes his  latitude, and therefore changes the angle between his horizon plane and  the axis of the earth. What effect will this have upon the position of  stars in his sky? If you were to go to the earth's equator, in what part  of the sky would you look for Polaris? Can Polaris be seen from  Australia? From South America? If you were to go from Minnesota to  Texas, in what respect would the appearance of stars in the northern sky  be changed? How would the appearance of stars in the southern sky be  changed?    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Diurnal path of Polaris.]    EXERCISE 8.--Determine your latitude by taking the altitude of Polaris  when it is at some one of the four points of its diurnal path, shown in  Fig. 12. When it is at _1_ it is said to be at upper culmination, and  the star [z] Ursæ Majoris in the handle of the Big Dipper will be  directly below it. When at _2_ it is at western elongation, and the  star Castor is near the meridian. When it is at _3_ it is at lower  culmination, and the star Spica is on the meridian. When it is at _4_ it  is at eastern elongation, and Altair is near the meridian. All of these  stars are conspicuous ones, which the student should find upon the map  and learn to recognize in the sky. The altitude observed at either _2_  or _4_ may be considered equal to the latitude of the place, but the  altitude observed when Polaris is at the positions marked _1_ and _3_  must be corrected for the star's distance from the pole, which may be  assumed equal to 1.3°.    The plumb-line apparatus described at page 12 is shown in Fig. 6  slightly modified, so as to adapt it to measuring the altitudes of  stars. Note that the board with the screw eye at one end has been  transferred from the box to the vertical standard, and has a screw eye  at each end. When the apparatus has been properly leveled, so that the  plumb line hangs at the middle of the hole in the box cover, the board  is to be pointed at the star by sighting through the centers of the two  screw eyes, and a pencil line is to be ruled along its edge upon the  face of the vertical standard. After this has been done turn the  apparatus halfway around so that what was the north side now points  south, level it again and revolve the board about the screw which holds  it to the vertical standard, until the screw eyes again point to the  star. Rule another line along the same edge of the board as before and  with a protractor measure the angle between these lines. Use a bicycle  lamp if you need artificial light for your work. The student who has  studied plane geometry should be able to prove that one half of the  angle between these lines is equal to the altitude of the star.    After you have determined your latitude from Polaris, compare the result  with your position as shown upon the best map available. With a little  practice and considerable care the latitude may be thus determined  within one tenth of a degree, which is equivalent to about 7 miles. If  you go 10 miles north or south from your first station you should find  the pole higher up or lower down in the sky by an amount which can be  measured with your apparatus.    19. THE MERIDIAN LINE.--To establish a true north and south line upon  the ground, use the apparatus as described at page 13, and when Polaris  is at upper or lower culmination drive into the ground two stakes in  line with the star and the plumb line. Such a meridian line is of great  convenience in observing the stars and should be laid out and  permanently marked in some convenient open space from which, if  possible, all parts of the sky are visible. June and November are  convenient months for this exercise, since Polaris then comes to  culmination early in the evening.    20. TIME.--What is _the time_ at which school begins in the morning?  What do you mean by \"_the time_\"?    The sidereal time at any moment is the right ascension of the hour  circle which at that moment coincides with the meridian. When the hour  circle passing through Sirius coincides with the meridian, the sidereal  time is 6h. 40m., since that is the right ascension of Sirius, and in  astronomical language Sirius is \"_on the meridian_\" at 6h. 40m. sidereal  time. As may be seen from the map, this 6h. 40m. is the right ascension  of Sirius, and if a clock be set to indicate 6h. 40m. when Sirius  crosses the meridian, it will show sidereal time. If the clock is  properly regulated, every other star in the heavens will come to the  meridian at the moment when the time shown by the clock is equal to the  right ascension of the star. A clock properly regulated for this purpose  will gain about four minutes per day in comparison with ordinary clocks,  and when so regulated it is called a sidereal clock. The student should  be provided with such a clock for his future work, but one such clock  will serve for several persons, and a nutmeg clock or a watch of the  cheapest kind is quite sufficient.    [Illustration: THE HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.]    EXERCISE 9.--Set such a clock to sidereal time by means of the transit  of a star over your meridian. For this experiment it is presupposed that  a meridian line has been marked out on the ground as in § 19, and the  simplest mode of performing the experiment required is for the observer,  having chosen a suitable star in the southern part of the sky, to place  his eye accurately over the northern end of the meridian line and to  estimate as nearly as possible the beginning and end of the period  during which the star appears to stand exactly above the southern end of  the line. The middle of this period may be taken as the time at which  the star crossed the meridian and at this moment the sidereal time is  equal to the right ascension of the star. The difference between this  right ascension and the observed middle instant is the error of the  clock or the amount by which its hands must be set back or forward in  order to indicate true sidereal time.    A more accurate mode of performing the experiment consists in using the  plumb-line apparatus carefully adjusted, as in Fig. 7, so that the line  joining the wire to the center of the screw eye shall be parallel to the  meridian line. Observe the time by the clock at which the star  disappears behind the wire as seen through the center of the screw eye.  If the star is too high up in the sky for convenient observation, place  a mirror, face up, just north of the screw eye and observe star, wire  and screw eye by reflection in it.    The numerical right ascension of the observed star is needed for this  experiment, and it may be measured from the star map, but it will  usually be best to observe one of the stars of the table at the end of  the book, and to obtain its right ascension as follows: The table gives  the right ascension and declination of each star as they were at the  beginning of the year 1900, but on account of the precession (see  Chapter V), these numbers all change slowly with the lapse of time, and  on the average the right ascension of each star of the table must be  increased by one twentieth of a minute for each year after 1900--i. e.,  in 1910 the right ascension of the first star of the table will be  0h. 38.6m. + (10/20)m. = 0h. 39.1m. The declinations also change  slightly, but as they are only"]]]
