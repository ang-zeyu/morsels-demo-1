Elasticity, which, better than any  other property of matter, could lead, through the idea of spring  or resistance, to that of impenetrability, is subject to the  control of a thousand circumstances, and depends entirely on  molecular attraction: now, what is more irreconcilable with  impenetrability than this attraction?  Finally, there is a  science which might be defined with exactness as the SCIENCE OF  PENETRABILITY OF MATTER:  I mean chemistry.  In fact, how does  what is called chemical composition differ from penetration?[5].  . . .  In short, we know matter only through its forms; of its  substance we know nothing.  How, then, is it possible to affirm  the reality of an invisible, impalpable, incoercible being, ever  changing, ever vanishing, impenetrable to thought alone, to which  it exhibits only its disguises?  Materialist!  I permit you to  testify to the reality of your sensations; as to what occasions  them, all that you can say involves this reciprocity: something  (which you call matter) is the occasion of sensations which are  felt by another something (which I call spirit).        [5] Chemists distinguish between MIXTURE and COMPOSITION, just  as logicians distinguish between the association of ideas and  their synthesis.  It is true, nevertheless, that, according to  the chemists, composition may be after all but a mixture, or  rather an aggregation of atoms, no longer fortuitous, but  systematic, the atoms forming different compounds by varying  their arrangement.  But still this is only an hypothesis, wholly  gratuitous; an hypothesis which explains nothing, and has not  even the merit of being logical.  Why does a purely NUMERICAL or  GEOMETRICAL difference in the composition and form of atoms give  rise to PHYSIOLOGICAL properties so different?  If atoms are  indivisible and impenetrable, why does not their association,  confined to mechanical effects, leave them unchanged in essence?  Where is the relation between the cause supposed and the effect  obtained?    We must distrust our intellectual vision: it is with chemical  theories as with psychological systems.  The mind, in order to  account for phenomena, works with atoms, which it does not and  can never see, as with the ME, which it does not perceive: it  applies its categories to everything; that is, it distinguishes,  individualizes, concretes, numbers, compares, things which,  material or immaterial, are thoroughly identical and  indistinguishable.  Matter, as well as spirit, plays, as we view  it, all sorts of parts; and, as there is nothing arbitrary in its  metamorphoses, we build upon them these psychologic and atomic  theories, true in so far as they faithfully represent, in terms  agreed upon, the series of phenomena, but radically false as soon  as they pretend to realize their abstractions and are accepted  literally.        2. But what, then, is the source of this supposition that matter  is impenetrable, which external observation does not justify and  which is not true; and what is its meaning?    Here appears the triumph of dualism.  Matter is pronounced  impenetrable, not, as the materialists and the vulgar fancy, by  the testimony of the senses, but by the conscience.  The ME, an  incomprehensible nature, feeling itself free, distinct, and  permanent, and meeting outside of itself another nature equally  incomprehensible, but also distinct and permanent in spite of its  metamorphoses, declares, on the strength of the sensations and  ideas which this essence suggests to it, that the NOT-ME is  extended and impenetrable.  Impenetrability is a figurative term,  an image by which thought, a division of the absolute, pictures  to itself material reality, another division of the absolute; but  this impenetrability, without which matter disappears, is, in the  last analysis, only a spontaneous judgment of inward sensation, a  metaphysical a priori, an unverified hypothesis of spirit.    Thus, whether philosophy, after having overthrown theological  dogmatism, spiritualizes matter or materializes thought,  idealizes being or realizes ideas; or whether, identifying  SUBSTANCE and CAUSE, it everywhere substitutes FORCE, phrases,  all, which explain and signify nothing,--it always leads us  back to this everlasting dualism, and, in summoning us to believe  in ourselves, compels us to believe in God, if not in spirits.  It is true that, making spirit a part of Nature, in distinction  from the ancients, who separated it, philosophy has been led to  this famous conclusion, which sums up nearly all the fruit of its  researches:  In man spirit KNOWS ITSELF, while everywhere else  it seems NOT TO KNOW ITSELf--\"That which is awake in man, which  dreams in the animal, and sleeps in the stone,\" said a  philosopher.    Philosophy, then, in its last hour, knows no more than at its  birth: as if it had appeared in the world only to verify the  words of Socrates, it says to us, wrapping itself solemnly around  with its funeral pall, \"I know only that I know nothing.\"  What  do I say?  Philosophy knows today that all its judgments rest on  two equally false, equally impossible, and yet equally necessary  and inevitable hypotheses,--matter and spirit.  So that, while in  former times religious intolerance and philosophic disputes,  spreading darkness everywhere, excused doubt and tempted to  libidinous indifference, the triumph of negation on all points no  longer permits even this doubt; thought, freed from every  barrier, but conquered by its own successes, is forced to affirm  what seems to it clearly contradictory and absurd.  The savages  say that the world is a great fetich watched over by a great  manitou.  For thirty centuries the poets, legislators, and sages  of civilization, handing down from age to age the philosophic  lamp, have written nothing more sublime than this profession of  faith.  And here, at the end of this long conspiracy against God,  which has called itself philosophy, emancipated reason concludes  with savage reason, The universe is a NOT-ME, objectified by a  ME.    Humanity, then, inevitably supposes the existence of God: and if,  during the long period which closes with our time, it has  believed in the reality of its hypothesis; if it has worshipped  the inconceivable object; if, after being apprehended in this act  of faith, it persists knowingly, but no longer voluntarily, in  this opinion of a sovereign being which it knows to be only a  personification of its own thought; if it is on the point of  again beginning its magic invocations,--we must believe that so  astonishing an hallucination conceals some mystery, which  deserves to be fathomed.    I say hallucination and mystery, but without intending to deny  thereby the superhuman content of the God-idea, and without  admitting the necessity of a new symbolism,--I mean a new  religion.  For if it is indisputable that humanity, in affirming  God,--or all that is included in the word me or spirit,--only  affirms itself, it is equally undeniable that it affirms itself  as something other than its own conception of itself, as all  mythologies and theologies show.  And since, moreover, this  affirmation is incontestable, it depends, without doubt, upon  hidden relations, which ought, if possible, to be determined  scientifically.    In other words, atheism, sometimes called humanism, true in its  critical and negative features, would be, if it stopped at man in  his natural condition, if it discarded as an erroneous judgment  the first affirmation of humanity, that it is the daughter,  emanation, image, reflection, or voice of God,--humanism, I say,  if it thus denied its past, would be but one contradiction more.  We are forced, then, to undertake the criticism of humanism; that  is, to ascertain whether humanity, considered as a whole and  throughout all its periods of development, satisfies the Divine  idea, after eliminating from the latter the exaggerated and  fanciful attributes of God; whether it satisfies the perfection  of being; whether it satisfies itself.  We are forced, in short,  to inquire whether humanity TENDS TOWARD God, according to the  ancient dogma, or is itself BECOMING God, as modern philosophers  claim.  Perhaps we shall find in the end that the two systems,  despite their seeming opposition, are both true and essentially  identical: in that case, the infallibility of human reason, in  its collective manifestations as well as its studied  speculations, would be decisively confirmed.--In a word, until we  have verified to man the hypothesis of God, there is nothing  definitive in the atheistic negation.    It is, then, a scientific, that is, an empirical demonstration of  the idea of God, that we need: now, such a demonstration has  never been attempted.  Theology dogmatizing on the authority of  its myths, philosophy speculating by the aid of categories, God  has existed as a TRANSCENDENTAL conception, incognizable by the  reason, and the hypothesis always subsists.    It subsists, I say, this hypothesis, more tenacious, more  pitiless than ever.  We have reached one of those prophetic  epochs when society, scornful of the past and doubtful of the  future, now distractedly clings to the present, leaving a few  solitary thinkers to establish the new faith; now cries to God  from the depths of its enjoyments and asks for a sign of  salvation, or seeks in the spectacle of its revolutions, as in  the entrails of a victim, the secret of its destiny.    Why need I insist further?  The hypothesis of God is allowable,  for it forces itself upon every man in spite of himself: no one,  then, can take exception to it.

The enjoyment of a _free and independent people_ can be       accomplished only through this principle: produce what you       consume. Draw from the native elements the necessaries of       life; permit no vitiated taste to lead you into expensive       luxuries, which can only be obtained by involving yourselves       in debt. Let home industry produce every article of home       consumption.\" . .    This Legislature, besides passing a code of laws for the government of  the Territory, sent some twenty memorials to Congress, most of them  calling for appropriations of public money, and divided up the canyons,  ferries, pasture-lands, woodlands, water privileges, and, in fact, all  the most valuable portion of the public domain, among prominent  \"saints,\" giving always to Brigham the \"lion's\" share. To this he was  entitled by his recognized appellation of \"the Lion of the Lord.\"    To this day he holds, by virtue of an Act of the Legislature, the most  valuable canyon, near Salt Lake, called City Creek, or Brigham's  Canyon,--having taken actual possession of the same, by fencing in the  mouth of the canyon completely, and thus preventing all ingress or  egress, except upon the payment of toll. General Connor, upon his  arrival in Utah, in the fall of 1862, was justly indignant to find  himself fenced out from one of the national thoroughfares, but thought  it prudent not to add to the causes of irritation by interfering.    During this session Brigham issued eight proclamations. The following is  the most celebrated of these _State Papers_:--           \"TERRITORY OF UTAH.         \"_A Proclamation for a Day of Praise and Thanksgiving._         \"It having pleased the Father of all good to make known his       mind and will to the children of men in these last days, and       through the administration of his angels to restore the holy       priesthood unto the sons of Adam, by which the gospel of his       Son has been proclaimed, and the ordinances of life and       salvation are administered; and through which medium the Holy       Ghost has been communicated to believing, willing, and honest       minds; causing faith, wisdom, and intelligence to spring up in       the hearts of men, and influencing them to flow together, from       the four quarters of the earth, to a land of peace and health,       rich in mineral and vegetable resources, reserved of old in       the councils of eternity for the purposes to which it is now       appropriated; a land choice above all other lands; far removed       from the strife, contentions, divisions, moral and physical       commotions, that are disturbing the peace of the nations and       kingdoms of the earth,--         \"I, Brigham Young, Governor of the Territory aforesaid, in       response to the time-honored custom of our fathers at Plymouth       Rock, by the governors of the several States and Territories,       and with a heart filled with humiliation and gratitude to the       Fountain of all good, for his multiplied munificence to his       children, have felt desirous to, and do, _proclaim_ Thursday,       the 1st day of January, eighteen hundred and fifty-two, a _Day       of Praise and Thanksgiving_, for the citizens of this our       peaceful Territory, in honor of the God of Abraham, who has       preserved his children amid all the vicissitudes they have       been called to pass; for his tender mercies in preserving the       nation undivided in which we live; for causing the gospel of       his kingdom to spread and take root upon the earth, beyond the       power of men and demons to destroy; and that he has promised       a day of universal joy and rejoicing to all the inhabitants       who shall remain when the earth shall have been purified by       fire, and rest in peace.         \"And I recommend to all good citizens of Utah, that they       abstain from everything which is calculated to mar or grieve       the Spirit of their Heavenly Father on that day; that they       rise early in the morning of the first day of the new year,       _and wash their bodies with pure water_; that all men attend       to their flocks and herds with carefulness, and see that no       creature in their charge is hungry, thirsty, or cold; while       the women are preparing the best of food for their households,       and their children ready to receive it in cleanliness and       cheerfulness; then let the head of each family with his       family, bow down upon his knees before the God of Israel, and       acknowledge all his sins, and the sins of his household; call       upon the Father, in the name of Jesus, for every blessing that       he desires for himself, his kindred, the Israel of God, the       universe of man; praying with full purpose of heart and united       faith that the union of the United States may be preserved       inviolate, against all the devices of wicked men, until truth       shall reign triumphant, and the glory of Jehovah shall fill       the earth.
