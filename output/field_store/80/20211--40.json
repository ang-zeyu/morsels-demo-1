But  then, too, few things are less likely than an outbreak to destroy the  House of Lords--my point is, that a catastrophe which levels one will  not spare the other.    I conceive, therefore, that the great power of the House of Lords  should be exercised very timidly and very cautiously. For the sake of  keeping the headship of the plutocracy, and through that of the nation,  they should not offend the plutocracy; the points upon which they have  to yield are mostly very minor ones, and they should yield many great  points rather than risk the bottom of their power. They should give  large donations out of income, if by so doing they keep, as they would  keep, their capital intact. The Duke of Wellington guided the House of  Lords in this manner for years, and nothing could prosper better for  them or for the country, and the Lords have only to go back to the good  path in which he directed them.    The events of 1870 caused much discussion upon life peerages, and we  have gained this great step, that whereas the former leader of the Tory  party in the Lords--Lord Lyndhurst--defeated the last proposal to make  life peers, Lord Derby, when leader of that party, desired to create  them. As I have given in this book what seemed to me good reasons for  making them, I need not repeat those reasons here; I need only say how  the notion stands in my judgment now.    I cannot look on life peerages in the way in which some of their  strongest advocates regard them; I cannot think of them as a mode in  which a permanent opposition or a contrast between the Houses of Lords  and Commons is to be remedied. To be effectual in that way, life  peerages must be very numerous. Now the House of Lords will never  consent to a very numerous life peerage without a storm; they must be  in terror to do it, or they will not do it. And if the storm blows  strongly enough to do so much, in all likelihood it will blow strongly  enough to do much more. If the revolution is powerful enough and eager  enough to make an immense number of life peers, probably it will sweep  away the hereditary principle in the Upper Chamber entirely. Of course  one may fancy it to be otherwise; we may conceive of a political storm  just going to a life-peerage limit, and then stopping suddenly. But in  politics we must not trouble ourselves with exceedingly exceptional  accidents; it is quite difficult enough to count on and provide for the  regular and plain probabilities. To speak mathematically, we may easily  miss the permanent course of the political curve if we engross our  minds with its cusps and conjugate points.    Nor, on the other hand, can I sympathise with the objection to life  peerages which some of the Radical party take and feel. They think it  will strengthen the Lords, and so make them better able to oppose the  Commons; they think, if they do not say: \"The House of Lords is our  enemy and that of all Liberals; happily the mass of it is not  intellectual; a few clever men are born there which we cannot help, but  we will not 'vaccinate' it with genius; we will not put in a set of  clever men for their lives who may as likely as not turn against us\".  This objection assumes that clever peers are just as likely to oppose  the Commons as stupid peers. But this I deny. Most clever men who are  in such a good place as the House of Lords plainly is, will be very  unwilling to lose it if they can help it; at the clear call of a great  duty they might lose it, but only at such a call. And it does not take  a clever man to see that systematic opposition of the Commons is the  only thing which can endanger the Lords, or which will make an  individual peer cease to be a peer. The greater you make the SENSE of  the Lords, the more they will see that their plain interest is to make  friends of the plutocracy, and to be the chiefs of it, and not to wish  to oppose the Commons where that plutocracy rules.    It is true that a completely new House of Lords, mainly composed of men  of ability, selected because they were able, might very likely attempt  to make ability the predominant power in the State, and to rival, if  not conquer, the House of Commons, where the standard of intelligence  is not much above the common English average. But in the present  English world such a House of Lords would soon lose all influence.  People would say, \"it was too clever by half,\" and in an Englishman's  mouth that means a very severe censure. The English people would think  it grossly anomalous if their elected assembly of rich men were  thwarted by a nominated assembly of talkers and writers. Sensible men  of substantial means are what we wish to be ruled by, and a peerage of  genius would not compare with it in power.    It is true, too, that at present some of the cleverest peers are not so  ready as some others to agree with the Commons. But it is not unnatural  that persons of high rank and of great ability should be unwilling to  bend to persons of lower rank, and of certainly not greater ability. A  few of such peers (for they are very few) might say, \"We had rather not  have our peerage if we are to buy it at the price of yielding\". But a  life peer who had fought his way up to the peers, would never think so.  Young men who are born to rank may risk it, not middle-aged or old men  who have earned their rank. A moderate number of life peers would  almost always counsel moderation to the Lords, and would almost always  be right in counselling it.    Recent discussions have also brought into curious prominence another  part of the Constitution. I said in this book that it would very much  surprise people if they were only told how many things the Queen could  do without consulting Parliament, and it certainly has so proved, for  when the Queen abolished Purchase in the Army by an act of prerogative  (after the Lords had rejected the bill for doing so), there was a great  and general astonishment.    But this is nothing to what the Queen can by law do without consulting  Parliament. Not to mention other things, she could disband the army (by  law she cannot engage more than a certain number of men, but she is not  obliged to engage any men); she could dismiss all the officers, from  the General Commanding-in-Chief downwards; she could dismiss all the  sailors too; she could sell off all our ships of war and all our naval  stores; she could make a peace by the sacrifice of Cornwall, and begin  a war for the conquest of Brittany. She could make every citizen in the  United Kingdom, male or female, a peer; she could make every parish in  the United Kingdom a \"university\"; she could dismiss most of the civil  servants; she could pardon all offenders. In a word, the Queen could by  prerogative upset all the action of civil government within the  Government, could disgrace the nation by a bad war or peace, and could,  by disbanding our forces, whether land or sea, leave us defenceless  against foreign nations. Why do we not fear that she would do this, or  any approach to it?    Because there are two checks--one ancient and coarse, the other modern  and delicate. The first is the check of impeachment. Any Minister who  advised the Queen so to use her prerogative as to endanger the safety  of the realm, might be impeached for high treason, and would be so.  Such a Minister would, in our technical law, be said to have levied, or  aided to levy, \"war against the Queen\". This counsel to her so to use  her prerogative would by the Judge be declared to be an act of violence  against herself, and in that peculiar but effectual way the offender  could be condemned and executed. Against all gross excesses of the  prerogative this is a sufficient protection. But it would be no  protection against minor mistakes; any error of judgment committed bona  fide, and only entailing consequences which one person might say were  good, and another say were bad, could not be so punished. It would be  possible to impeach any Minister who disbanded the Queen's army, and it  would be done for certain. But suppose a Minister were to reduce the  army or the navy much below the contemplated strength--suppose he were  only to spend upon them one-third of the amount which Parliament had  permitted him to spend--suppose a Minister of Lord Palmerston's  principles were suddenly and while in office converted to the  principles of Mr. Bright and Mr. Cobden, and were to act on those  principles, he could not be impeached. The law of treason neither could  nor ought to be enforced against an act which was an error of judgment,  not of intention--which was in good faith intended not to impair the  well-being of the State, but to promote and augment it. Against such  misuses of the prerogative our remedy is a change of Ministry. And in  general this works very well. Every Minister looks long before he  incurs that penalty, and no one incurs it wantonly. But, nevertheless,  there are two defects in it. The first is that it may not be a remedy  at all; it may be only a punishment. A Minister may risk his dismissal;  he may do some act difficult to undo, and then all which may be left  will be to remove and censure him. And the second is that it is only  one House of Parliament which has much to say to this remedy, such as  it is; the House of Commons only can remove a Minister by a vote of  censure. Most of the Ministries for thirty years have never possessed  the confidence of the Lords, and in such cases a vote of censure by the  Lords could therefore have but little weight; it would be simply the  particular expression of a general political disapproval. It would be  like a vote of censure on a Liberal Government by the Carlton, or on a  Tory Government by the Reform Club. And in no case has an adverse vote  by the Lords the same decisive effect as a vote of the Commons; the  Lower House is the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#5)"],[1,"even more so when it busies itself in deflecting them, though  without altering their form, towards some mechanical occupation, such  as sawing wood, striking on an anvil, or tugging away at an imaginary  bell-rope. Not that vulgarity is the essence of the comic,--although  certainly it is to some extent an ingredient,--but rather that the  incriminated gesture seems more frankly mechanical when it can be  connected with a simple operation, as though it were intentionally  mechanical. To suggest this mechanical interpretation ought to be one  of the favourite devices of parody. We have reached this result through  deduction, but I imagine clowns have long had an intuition of the fact.    This seems to me the solution of the little riddle propounded by Pascal  in one passage of his Thoughts: \"Two faces that are alike, although  neither of them excites laughter by itself, make us laugh when  together, on account of their likeness.\" It might just as well be said:  \"The gestures of a public speaker, no one of which is laughable by  itself, excite laughter by their repetition.\" The truth is that a  really living life should never repeat itself. Wherever there is  repetition or complete similarity, we always suspect some mechanism at  work behind the living. Analyse the impression you get from two faces  that are too much alike, and you will find that you are thinking of two  copies cast in the same mould, or two impressions of the same seal, or  two reproductions of the same negative,--in a word, of some  manufacturing process or other. This deflection of life towards the  mechanical is here the real cause of laughter.    And laughter will be more pronounced still, if we find on the stage not  merely two characters, as in the example from Pascal, but several, nay,  as great a number as possible, the image of one another, who come and  go, dance and gesticulate together, simultaneously striking the same  attitudes and tossing their arms about in the same manner. This time,  we distinctly think of marionettes. Invisible threads seem to us to be  joining arms to arms, legs to legs, each muscle in one face to its  fellow-muscle in the other: by reason of the absolute uniformity which  prevails, the very litheness of the bodies seems to stiffen as we gaze,  and the actors themselves seem transformed into automata. Such, at  least, appears to be the artifice underlying this somewhat obvious form  of amusement. I daresay the performers have never read Pascal, but what  they do is merely to realise to the full the suggestions contained in  Pascal's words. If, as is undoubtedly the case, laughter is caused in  the second instance by the hallucination of a mechanical effect, it  must already have been so, though in more subtle fashion, in the first.    Continuing along this path, we dimly perceive the increasingly  important and far-reaching consequences of the law we have just stated.  We faintly catch still more fugitive glimpses of mechanical effects,  glimpses suggested by man's complex actions, no longer merely by his  gestures. We instinctively feel that the usual devices of comedy, the  periodical repetition of a word or a scene, the systematic inversion of  the parts, the geometrical development of a farcical misunderstanding,  and many other stage contrivances, must derive their comic force from  the same source,--the art of the playwright probably consisting in  setting before us an obvious clockwork arrangement of human events,  while carefully preserving an outward aspect of probability and thereby  retaining something of the suppleness of life. But we must not  forestall results which will be duly disclosed in the course of our  analysis.      V    Before going further, let us halt a moment and glance around. As we  hinted at the outset of this study, it would be idle to attempt to  derive every comic effect from one simple formula. The formula exists  well enough in a certain sense, but its development does not follow a  straightforward course. What I mean is that the process of deduction  ought from time to time to stop and study certain culminating effects,  and that these effects each appear as models round which new effects  resembling them take their places in a circle. These latter are not  deductions from the formula, but are comic through their relationship  with those that are. To quote Pascal again, I see no objection, at this  stage, to defining the process by the curve which that geometrician  studied under the name of roulette or cycloid,--the curve traced by a  point in the circumference of a wheel when the carriage is advancing in  a straight line: this point turns like the wheel, though it advances  like the carriage. Or else we might think of an immense avenue such as  are to be seen in the forest of Fontainebleau, with crosses at  intervals to indicate the cross-ways: at each of these we shall walk  round the cross, explore for a while the paths that open out before us,  and then return to our original course. Now, we have just reached one  of these mental crossways. Something mechanical encrusted on the  living, will represent a cross at which we must halt, a central image  from which the imagination branches off in different directions. What  are these directions? There appear to be three main ones. We will  follow them one after the other, and then continue our onward course.    1. In the first place, this view of the mechanical and the living  dovetailed into each other makes us incline towards the vaguer image of  SOME RIGIDITY OR OTHER applied to the mobility of life, in an awkward  attempt to follow its lines and counterfeit its suppleness. Here we  perceive how easy it is for a garment to become ridiculous. It might  almost be said that every fashion is laughable in some respect. Only,  when we are dealing with the fashion of the day, we are so accustomed  to it that the garment seems, in our mind, to form one with the  individual wearing it. We do not separate them in imagination. The idea  no longer occurs to us to contrast the inert rigidity of the covering  with the living suppleness of the object covered: consequently, the  comic here remains in a latent condition. It will only succeed in  emerging when the natural incompatibility is so deep-seated between the  covering and the covered that even an immemorial association fails to  cement this union: a case in point is our head and top hat. Suppose,  however, some eccentric individual dresses himself in the fashion of  former times: our attention is immediately drawn to the clothes  themselves, we absolutely distinguish them from the individual, we say  that the latter IS DISGUISING HIMSELF,--as though every article of  clothing were not a disguise!--and the laughable aspect of fashion  comes out of the shadow into the light.    Here we are beginning to catch a faint glimpse of the highly intricate  difficulties raised by this problem of the comic. One of the reasons  that must have given rise to many erroneous or unsatisfactory theories  of laughter is that many things are comic de jure without being comic  de facto, the continuity of custom having deadened within them the  comic quality. A sudden dissolution of continuity is needed, a break  with fashion, for this quality to revive. Hence the impression that  this dissolution of continuity is the parent of the comic, whereas all  it does is to bring it to our notice. Hence, again, the explanation of  laughter by surprise, contrast, etc., definitions which would equally  apply to a host of cases in which we have no inclination whatever to  laugh. The truth of the matter is far from being so simple. But to  return to our idea of disguise, which, as we have just shown, has been  entrusted with the special mandate of arousing laughter. It will not be  out of place to investigate the uses it makes of this power.    Why do we laugh at a head of hair which has changed from dark to blond?  What is there comic about a rubicund nose? And why does one laugh at a  negro? The question would appear to be an embarrassing one, for it has  been asked by successive psychologists such as Hecker, Kraepelin and  Lipps, and all have given different replies. And yet I rather fancy the  correct answer was suggested to me one day in the street by an ordinary  cabby, who applied the expression \"unwashed\" to the negro fare he was  driving. Unwashed! Does not this mean that a black face, in our  imagination, is one daubed over with ink or soot? If so, then a red  nose can only be one which has received a coating of vermilion. And so  we see that the notion of disguise has passed on something of its comic  quality to instances in which there is actually no disguise, though  there might be.    In the former set of examples, although his usual dress was distinct  from the individual, it appeared in our mind to form one with him,  because we had become accustomed to the sight. In the latter, although  the black or red colour is indeed inherent in the skin, we look upon it  as artificially laid on, because it surprises us.    But here we meet with a fresh crop of difficulties in the theory of the  comic. Such a proposition as the following: \"My usual dress forms part  of my body\" is absurd in the eyes of reason. Yet imagination looks upon  it as true. \"A red nose is a painted nose,\" \"A negro is a white man in  disguise,\" are also absurd to the reason which rationalises; but they  are gospel truths to pure imagination. So there is a logic of the  imagination which is not the logic of reason, one which at times is  even opposed to the latter,--with which, however, philosophy must  reckon, not only in the study of the comic, but in every other  investigation of the same kind. It is something like the logic of  dreams, though of dreams that have not been left to the whim of  individual fancy, being the dreams dreamt by the whole of society. In  order to reconstruct this hidden logic, a special kind of effort "]]]
