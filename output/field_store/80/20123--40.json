Sometimes the hollow is lined with a neat pavement of stones placed side  by side, one layer deep, on which the hen squats, afterwards building up  the sides around her. At other times the scoop would be filled up  indiscriminately by a heap of pebbles on which the hen then sat, working  herself down into a hollow in the middle.    Individuals differ, not only in their building methods, but also in the  size of the stones they select. Side by side may be seen a nest composed  wholly of very big stones, so large that it is a matter for wonder how  the birds can carry them, and another nest of quite small stones.  (Fig. 14.)    Different couples seem to vary much in character or mood. Some can be  seen quarrelling violently, whilst others appear most affectionate, and  the tender politeness of some of these latter toward one another is very  pretty to see. (Fig. 13.)      [Illustration: Fig. 14. \"SIDE BY SIDE ... NESTS OF VERY BIG STONES AND    NESTS OF VERY SMALL STONES\" (Page 26)]    I may here mention that the temperatures were rising considerably by  October 19, ranging about zero F.    During October 20 the stream of arrivals was incessant. Some mingled at  once with the crowd, others lay in batches on the sea-ice a few yards  short of the rookery, content to have got so far, and evidently feeling  the need for rest after their long journey from the pack. The greater  part of this journey was doubtless performed by swimming, as they  crossed open water, but I think that much of it must have been done on  foot over many miles of sea-ice, to account for the fatigue of many of  them.    Their swimming I will describe later. On the ice they have two modes of  progression. The first is simple walking. Their legs being very short,  their stride amounts at most to four inches. Their rate of stepping  averages about one hundred and twenty steps per minute when on the  march.    Their second mode of progression is \"tobogganing.\" When wearied by  walking or when the surface is particularly suitable, they fall forward  on to their white breasts, smooth and shimmering with a beautiful  metallic lustre in the sunlight, and push themselves along by alternate  powerful little strokes of their legs behind them.    When quietly on the march, both walking and tobogganing produce the same  rate of progression, so that the string of arriving birds, tailing out  in a long line as far as the horizon, appears as a well-ordered  procession. I walked out a mile or so along this line, standing for some  time watching it tail past me and taking the photographs with which I  have illustrated the scene. Most of the little creatures seemed much out  of breath, their wheezy respiration being distinctly heard.    First would pass a string of them walking, then a dozen or so  tobogganing. (Fig. 15.) Suddenly those that walked would flop on to  their breasts and start tobogganing, and conversely strings of  tobogganers would as suddenly pop up on to their feet and start walking.  In this way they relieved the monotony of their march, and gave  periodical rest to different groups of muscles and nerve-centres.    The surface of the snow on the sea-ice varied continually, and over any  very smooth patches the pedestrians almost invariably started to  toboggan, whilst over \"bad going\" they all had perforce to walk.    Figs. 16, 17, 18 and 19 present some idea of the procession of these  thousands on thousands of penguins as day after day they passed into the  rookery.      [Illustration: Fig. 15. ON THE MARCH TO THE ROOKERY OVER THE SEA-ICE.    SOME ARE WALKING AND SOME \"TOBOGGANING\" (Page 28)]    When tobogganing, turning to one side or the other is done with one or  more strokes of the opposite flipper. When fleeing or chasing, both  flippers as well as both feet are used in propulsion, and over most  surfaces tobogganing is thus their fastest mode of progression, but when  going at full tilt it is also the most exhausting, and after a short  spurt in this way they invariably return to the walking position.    By October 20 many of the nests were complete, and the hens sat in them,  though no eggs were to be seen yet. In the middle of one of the frozen  lakes rose a little island, well suited for nesting except for the fact  that later in the season, probably about the time when the young chicks  were hatched, the lake would be thawed and the approach to the island  only to be accomplished through about six inches or more of dirty water  and ooze. Until then, however, the surface of the lake would remain  frozen, and was at this time covered with snow.    Not a penguin attempted to build its nest on this island, though many  passed it or walked over it in crossing the lake. How did they realize  that later on they would get dirty every time they journeyed to or from  the spot?    Not far from this island another mound rose from the lake, but this was  connected with the \"mainland\" by a narrow neck of guano-covered pebbles.  This mound was covered with nests, showing that the birds understood  this place could always be reached over dry land. Surely this was well  worth remarking.    There was a part of the ice-foot on the south side of the rookery where  a track worn by many ascending penguins could be seen, leading from the  sea-ice on to the beach. The place was steep and the ice slippery, and,  in fact, the track led straight up a most difficult ascent. Not ten  yards from this well-worn track a perfectly easy slope led up from the  sea-ice to the rookery. The tracks in the freshly fallen snow showed  that only one penguin had gone up this way. Presumably the first arrival  in that place had taken the difficult path, and all subsequent arrivals  blindly followed in his tracks, whilst only one had had the good luck or  independence to choose the easier way.    On October 21 many thousands of penguins arrived from the northerly  direction, and poured on to the beach in a continuous stream, the snaky  line of arrivals extending unbroken across the sea-ice as far as the eye  could see.      [Illustration: Fig. 16. PART OF THE LINE OF APPROACHING BIRDS, SEVERAL    MILES IN LENGTH (Page 28)]    A great many now started to climb the heights up the precipitous side of  Cape Adare and to build their nests as far as the summit, a height of  some 1000 feet, although there was still room for many thousand more  down below. What could be their object, considering the wearisome  journeys they would have to make to feed their young, it is impossible  to say. It might be the result of the same spirit which made them spread  out in little scattered groups over the rookery when only a few had  arrived, and that they prefer wider room, only putting up with the  greater crowding which ensues later as a necessary evil. There is,  however, another explanation which I will discuss in another place.    At 9 P.M. it was getting dusk, and the rookery comparatively silent,  although on some of the knolls two or three birds might be seen still  busily working, toddling to and fro fetching stones. The other thousands  lay at rest, their white breasts flat on the ground, and only their  black beaks and heads visible as they lay with their chins stretched  forward on the ground, whilst in place of the massed discord of clamour  heard during the day, the separate voices of some of the busy ones were  distinct. A fine powdering of snow was falling.    It would be difficult to estimate the number of penguins that poured  into the rookery during the following day. There was no evidence that  any pairing had taken place on or before the march, and the birds all  had the appearance of being quite independent.    Far away from the beach the line had become thicker, and was no longer  in single file, the progress of the birds being slow and steady, but  when within half a mile or so from the beach, excitement seemed to take  possession of them, and they would break into a run, hastening over the  remaining distance, the line now being a thin one, with slight curves in  it, each bird running, with wide gait, and outstretched flippers working  away in unison with its little legs. In fact, the whole air of the line  at this time was that of a school-treat arrived in sight of its  playing-fields, and breaking into a run in its eagerness to get there.      [Illustration: Fig. 17. ARRIVING AT THE ROOKERY (Page 28)]    Arrived at the rookery, and plunged suddenly amidst the din of that  squalling, fighting, struggling crowd, the contrast with the dead  silence and loneliness of the pack-ice they had so recently left, was as  great a one as can well be imagined; yet once there, the birds seemed  collected and at home. This was a matter of surprise to me then, but I  remember now my own sensations on arriving home after my life in the  Antarctic, and that I felt only slightly the sudden return to the bustle  of civilization.    Our presence among them made little or no difference to the penguins.  When we passed them closely they would bridle up and swear or even run  at us and peck at our legs or batter them with their flippers, but  unless their nesting operations were interfered with this attack was  short-lived, and the next moment the birds would seem to forget our very  existence. If I walked by the side of a long, nest-covered ridge, a low  growl arose from every bird as I passed it, and the massed sound,  gathering in front and dying away behind as I advanced, reminded me  forcibly of the sound of the crowds on the towing-path at the 'Varsity  boatrace as the crews pass up the river.    Walking actually among the nests, your temper is tried sorely, as every  bird within reach has a peck at your legs, and occasionally a cock  attacks you bravely, battering you with his little flippers in a manner  ludicrous at first but aggravating after a time, as the operation is  painful and severe enough to leave bruises"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36924"],[0,"The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci, and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career (#5)"],[1," refitted,  the duration of the stay being given as thirty-seven days in the first,  and forty-four days in the second voyage; evidently the same incident,  serving for the imaginary as well as for the real voyage. This \"best  harbour in the world\" was, according to Las Casas, the Gulf of Cariaco,  near Cumana, where Hojeda refitted. Lastly, there is the encounter with  natives, when one Spaniard was killed and twenty-two wounded. Vespucci  asserts that an encounter took place during his first voyage with this  number of casualties. Las Casas had seen a letter from Roldan, containing  information from Hojeda's officers, in which an encounter is mentioned  with the same casualties, one killed and about twenty wounded. Modern  critics will agree with Las Casas that this coincidence is alone  sufficient to prove the fictitious character of the first voyage of  Vespucci.    The greater part of Vespucci's narrative of his first voyage is taken  up with accounts of the manners and customs of the natives; touching  which Las Casas has made some very pertinent remarks. Many of the things  Vespucci states could not have been known to him in the few days that  he remained on the coast, because he did not know a single word of the  language, as he himself confesses. He can only be believed in those  statements based on what he actually saw or might have seen, and all  these are perfectly applicable to the natives of the coast seen during  Hojeda's voyage. The rest are pronounced by Las Casas to be all fiction;  as well as his enumeration of the animals he saw. Vespucci gives one word  in the native language--_Carabi_, meaning \"a man of great wisdom\". Upon  this Las Casas remarks that the Spaniards did not even know the names  for bread or for water, yet Vespucci wants us to believe that, during  the few days he remained at that place, he understood that _Carabi_  signified a man of great wisdom. He got the word, of course, from the  name of the people he heard of during the voyage of Hojeda--the Carribs,  or Canibas--and made it serve his purpose in this passage.[40]    Vespucci does not mention the names of the commanders of the expedition,  nor of any of his Spanish comrades; and he gives only one native word,  _Carabi_; three names of articles of food, _Yuca_, _Casabi_, and _Ignami_;  and two names of places, _Iti_ and _Parias_ (or _Lariab_?).    Two of the names for food, _Yuca_ and _Casabi_, belong to the language  of the Antilles, and Vespucci would have heard of them during his voyage  with Hojeda. _Ignami_ is an African word, which he would have picked up  at Lisbon. The use of the word _Yuca_, as belonging to the language of  the natives of the Mexican coast near 23 deg. N., is one more proof of the  imposture of his narrative.[41]    The name of _Parias_ requires fuller notice. It is alleged to be the  name of a province in 23 deg. N., and is thus spelt in the Latin version.  Las Casas, therefore, naturally used it as one argument against the truth  of Vespucci's narrative, for _Paria_ was well known to be a province of  the mainland opposite the island of Trinidad, discovered by Columbus. But  in the Italian version the word is _Lariab_, an _L_ being substituted  for _P_, and _b_ for _s_. Varnhagen endeavours to make a strong point  of this discrepancy. He eagerly adopts _Lariab_ as the correct form,  having found (not _Lariab_) but two words ending in _ab_ in a vocabulary  of the Huasteca Indians, whose country is near the northern frontier of  Mexico. It is impossible to ascertain, with certainty, whether _Parias_,  or _Lariab_, or either, was the word in the original manuscript of  Vespucci, which is lost. It is in favour of _Lariab_ that the Italian  version was probably printed from the manuscript without previous  translation; while the version containing _Parias_ was translated into  French, and then into Latin, before it was printed. On the other hand,  there is strong reason for the belief that the editor of the Latin version  had not then heard of the particulars of the third voyage of Columbus,  or of the name of Paria.[42] In that case it could not have come into  his head to print _Parias_ for _Lariab_, and consequently _Parias_ was  the original form, and _Lariab_ a misprint of the Italian version. On the  whole, _Parias_ is probably correct; but the question is not important,  because the evidence against Vespucci is quite sufficient without the  _Parias_ argument.    The internal evidence against the authenticity of the first voyage is  conclusive. It satisfied the impartial and acute historian Las Casas  at the time, and has not been shaken by the arguments of Varnhagen,  who did not adduce any new facts. But the external evidence is even  stronger. It was evident to Varnhagen that it was a necessity of his  argument that an expedition should be provided, with which Vespucci might  have sailed. Without vessels and a commander there could have been no  voyage. These essentials have been furnished by the rehabilitator of  Vespucci with some audacity. It was recorded by Las Casas and Herrera  that, after the return of Columbus from his last voyage in 1505, an  expedition to follow up his discoveries was fitted out by Vicente Yanez  Pinzon, Juan Diaz de Solis, and Pedro de Ledesma, and that they discovered  the coast of Yucatan. Herrera gives the date 1506; but the real date  was 1508, as given by Peter Martyr.[43] The authority for the narratives  of Las Casas and Herrera is the evidence given by Pinzon, Ledesma, and  others, in the Columbus lawsuit. Peter Martyr, however, collected his  information on the subject independently. Varnhagen suggests that these  navigators did not undertake their voyage, in 1508, after the return of  Columbus, but in 1497, and that this was the first voyage of Vespucci.    The arguments for this alteration of eleven years in the date of a voyage  of discovery are slight indeed. Oviedo, in his _History of the Indies_,  wrote that the pilots Pinzon, Solis, and Ledesma discovered the Honduras  coast with three vessels, before Pinzon was off the mouth of the Amazon,  which was in 1499; and Gomara has the following passage: \"but some say  that Pinzon and Solis had been on the Honduras coast three years before  Columbus.\" These writers were unscrupulous, and hostile to Columbus.  It requires somewhat bold assurance to give the date of 1497 to the  Pinzon and Solis voyages on the strength of these passages. Oviedo  indeed puts Vespucci out of court at once, for he says that Pinzon,  Solis, and Ledesma sailed with three vessels; while Vespucci asserts  that in his first voyage there were four vessels. Moreover, Ledesma,  who was pilot and captain of one of the vessels, was a lad of 21 in 1497,  and could not have been in such a position; but in 1508, when the Pinzon  and Solis expedition really sailed, he was of a suitable age.[44]    Although the expedition of Pinzon, Solis, and Ledesma certainly did  not take place in 1497, there has always been some obscurity attending  its history, which has only recently been cleared up through the  able researches of Mr. Harrisse.[45] The confusion has arisen from  discrepancies between the evidence given by Pinzon and Ledesma in the  Columbus lawsuit. Pinzon said that he reached the island of Guanaja in the  Gulf of Honduras, and then followed the coast east as far as the provinces  of Chabaca and Pintigron, and the mountains of Caria (Paria?). But  Ledesma said that they went north from the island of Guanaja, came to  Chabaca and Pintigron, and reached a point as far north as 23-1/2 deg.  Here there is clearly a mistake, one going east and the other north,  yet both coming to Chabaca and Pintigron. It can only be decided whether  the mistake is in the evidence of Pinzon or of Ledesma by ascertaining  the positions of Chabaca and Pintigron; and the explanation is afforded  by Peter Martyr in his second _Decade_.[46] He there says that Pinzon  turned his course to the east (\"towards the left hand\") towards Paria,  where princes came to him named Chiauaccha[47] and Pintiguanus. Ledesma's  northerly course was either a falsehood, as Mr. Harrisse rather hastily  assumes, or a clerical or printer's error. The only voyage of Pinzon and  Solis took place in 1508,[48] and was from the Gulf of Honduras eastward  to Paria.    There was no voyage of discovery sent by the King in 1497. When  Diego Columbus instituted the lawsuit to recover his father's rights,  the Crown lawyers turned every stone for evidence that others made  discoveries besides the Admiral. The lawsuit lasted from 1508 to 1527.  If an expedition sent by the King in 1497 had discovered 870 leagues of  new coast-line, it is incredible that the proofs would not then have  been forthcoming, when many of those who took part in the expedition  must have been alive, and there was not only no reason for secrecy,  but the strongest motive for publicity.    When the evidence respecting Pinzon and Solis was taken in 1516, Vespucci  had been dead some years. He had never ventured to publish his letter in  Spain; but Fernando Columbus purchased a copy at Rome and added it to his  library at Seville in 1515, three years after Vespucci's death. If the  first voyage had not been known to be a fabrication, the letter would  have been eagerly brought forward as evidence of extensive discoveries  not made by the Admiral. For by that time other copies, besides the one  in Fernando's library, had probably reached Spain.    Then there is the negative evidence of maps. Juan de la Cosa drew his  famous map of the world in 1500, after serving in the voyage of Hojeda,  in company with Vespucci. He placed flags on the discovered parts, and  one on each of the farthest known points. There is a Spanish flag at  Cabo de la Vela, the extreme point then known in South America, another  at the extreme point reached by Columbus on the north coast of Cuba,  and an English flag at the extreme point reached by "]]]
