Volume 1 (#5)"],[1," the two were married, and Abelard returned to his  lecture-room and to his studies. For months they met but seldom.  Meanwhile, however, the taunts and innuendos directed against Heloise  so irritated Fulbert that he broke his promise of secrecy, and told his  friends that Abelard and Heloise were man and wife. They went to  Heloise for confirmation. Once more she showed in an extraordinary way  the depth of her devotion.    \"I am no wife,\" she said. \"It is not true that Abelard has married me.  My uncle merely tells you this to save my reputation.\"    They asked her whether she would swear to this; and, without a moment's  hesitation, this pure and noble woman took an oath upon the Scriptures  that there had been no marriage.    Fulbert was enraged by this. He ill-treated Heloise, and, furthermore,  he forbade Abelard to visit her. The girl, therefore, again left her  uncle's house and betook herself to a convent just outside of Paris,  where she assumed the habit of a nun as a disguise. There Abelard  continued from time to time to meet her.    When Fulbert heard of this he put his own interpretation on it. He  believed that Abelard intended to ignore the marriage altogether, and  that possibly he might even marry some other woman. In any case, he now  hated Abelard with all his heart; and he resolved to take a fearful and  unnatural vengeance which would at once prevent his enemy from making  any other marriage, while at the same time it would debar him from  ecclesiastical preferment.    To carry out his plot Fulbert first bribed a man who was the  body-servant of Abelard, watching at the door of his room each night.  Then he hired the services of four ruffians. After Abelard had retired  and was deep in slumber the treacherous valet unbarred the door. The  hirelings of Fulbert entered and fell upon the sleeping man. Three of  them bound him fast, while the fourth, with a razor, inflicted on him  the most shameful mutilation that is possible. Then, extinguishing the  lights, the wretches slunk away and were lost in darkness, leaving  behind their victim bound to his couch, uttering cries of torment and  bathed in his own blood.    It is a shocking story, and yet it is intensely characteristic of the  lawless and barbarous era in which it happened. Early the next morning  the news flew rapidly through Paris. The city hummed like a bee-hive.  Citizens and students and ecclesiastics poured into the street and  surrounded the house of Abelard.    \"Almost the entire city,\" says Fulques, as quoted by McCabe, \"went  clamoring toward his house. Women wept as if each one had lost her  husband.\"    Unmanned though he was, Abelard still retained enough of the spirit of  his time to seek vengeance. He, in his turn, employed ruffians whom he  set upon the track of those who had assaulted him. The treacherous  valet and one of Fulbert's hirelings were run down, seized, and  mutilated precisely as Abelard had been; and their eyes were blinded. A  third was lodged in prison. Fulbert himself was accused before one of  the Church courts, which alone had power to punish an ecclesiastic, and  all his goods were confiscated.    But, meantime, how did it fare with Heloise? Her grief was greater than  his own, while her love and her devotion were absolutely undiminished.  But Abelard now showed a selfishness--and indeed, a meanness--far  beyond any that he had before exhibited. Heloise could no more be his  wife. He made it plain that he put no trust in her fidelity. He was  unwilling that she should live in the world while he could not; and so  he told her sternly that she must take the veil and bury herself for  ever in a nunnery.    The pain and shame which she experienced at this came wholly from the  fact that evidently Abelard did not trust her. Long afterward she wrote:    God knows I should not have hesitated, at your command, to precede or  to follow you to hell itself!    It was his distrust that cut her to the heart. Still, her love for him  was so intense that she obeyed his order. Soon after she took the vows;  and in the convent chapel, shaken with sobs, she knelt before the altar  and assumed the veil of a cloistered nun. Abelard himself put on the  black tunic of a Benedictine monk and entered the Abbey of St. Denis.    It is unnecessary here to follow out all the details of the lives of  Abelard and Heloise after this heart-rendering scene. Abelard passed  through many years of strife and disappointment, and even of  humiliation; for on one occasion, just as he had silenced Guillaume de  Champeaux, so he himself was silenced and put to rout by Bernard of  Clairvaux--\"a frail, tense, absorbed, dominant little man, whose face  was white and worn with suffering,\" but in whose eyes there was a light  of supreme strength. Bernard represented pure faith, as Abelard  represented pure reason; and the two men met before a great council to  match their respective powers.    Bernard, with fiery eloquence, brought a charge of heresy against  Abelard in an oration which was like a charge of cavalry. When he had  concluded Abelard rose with an ashen face, stammered out a few words,  and sat down. He was condemned by the council, and his works were  ordered to be burned.    All his later life was one of misfortune, of humiliation, and even of  personal danger. The reckless monks whom he tried to rule rose fiercely  against him. His life was threatened. He betook himself to a desolate  and lonely place, where he built for himself a hut of reeds and rushes,  hoping to spend his final years in meditation. But there were many who  had not forgotten his ability as a teacher. These flocked by hundreds  to the desert place where he abode. His hut was surrounded by tents and  rude hovels, built by his scholars for their shelter.    Thus Abelard resumed his teaching, though in a very different frame of  mind. In time he built a structure of wood and stone, which he called  the Paraclete, some remains of which can still be seen.    All this time no word had passed between him and Heloise. But presently  Abelard wrote and gave to the world a curious and exceedingly frank  book, which he called The Story of My Misfortunes. A copy of it reached  the hands of Heloise, and she at once sent to Abelard the first of a  series of letters which have remained unique in the literature of love.    Ten years had passed, and yet the woman's heart was as faithful and as  full of yearning as on the day when the two had parted. It has been  said that the letters are not genuine, and they must be read with this  assertion in mind; yet it is difficult to believe that any one save  Heloise herself could have flung a human soul into such frankly  passionate utterances, or that any imitator could have done the work.    In her first letter, which was sent to Abelard written upon parchment,  she said:    At thy command I would change, not merely my costume, but my very soul,  so entirely art thou the sole possessor of my body and my spirit.  Never, God is my witness, never have I sought anything in thee but  thyself; I have sought thee, and not thy gifts. I have not looked to  the marriage-bond or dowry.    She begged him to write to her, and to lead her to God, as once he had  led her into the mysteries of pleasure. Abelard answered in a letter,  friendly to be sure, but formal--the letter of a priest to a cloistered  nun. The opening words of it are characteristic of the whole:    To Heloise, his sister in Christ, from Abelard, her brother in Him.    The letter was a long one, but throughout the whole of it the writer's  tone was cold and prudent. Its very coldness roused her soul to a  passionate revolt. Her second letter bursts forth in a sort of anguish:    How hast thou been able to frame such thoughts, dearest? How hast thou  found words to convey them? Oh, if I dared but call God cruel to me!  Oh, most wretched of all creatures that I am! So sweet did I find the  pleasures of our loving days that I cannot bring myself to reject them  or to banish them from my memory. Wheresoever I go, they thrust  themselves upon my vision, and rekindle the old desire.    But Abelard knew only too well that not in this life could there be  anything save spiritual love between himself and Heloise. He wrote to  her again and again, always in the same remote and unimpassioned way.  He tells her about the history of monasticism, and discusses with her  matters of theology and ethics; but he never writes one word to feed  the flame that is consuming her. The woman understood at last; and by  degrees her letters became as calm as his--suffused, however, with a  tenderness and feeling which showed that in her heart of hearts she was  still entirely given to him.    After some years Abelard left his dwelling at the Paraclete, and there  was founded there a religious house of which Heloise became the abbess.  All the world respected her for her sweetness, her wisdom, and the  purity of her character. She made friends as easily as Abelard made  enemies. Even Bernard, who had overthrown her husband, sought out  Heloise to ask for her advice and counsel.    Abelard died while on his way to Rome, whither he was journeying in  order to undergo a penalty; and his body was brought back to the  Paraclete, where it was entombed. Over it for twenty-two years Heloise  watched with tender care; and when she died, her body was laid beside  that of her lover.    To-day their bones are mingled as she would have desired them to be  mingled. The stones of their tomb in the great cemetery of Pere  Lachaise were brought from the ruins of the Paraclete, and above the  sarcophagus are two recumbent figures, the whole being the work of the  artist Alexandra Lenoir, who died in 1836. The figure representing  Heloise is not, however, an authentic likeness. The model for it was a  lady belonging to a noble family of France, and the figure itself was  brought to Pere Lachaise from the ancient College"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#5)"],[1,"of disgrace than stand in the way of Abelard's advancement.    He has himself given some of the words in which she pleaded with him:    What glory shall I win from you, when I have made you quite inglorious  and have humbled both of us? What vengeance will the world inflict on  me if I deprive it of one so brilliant? What curses will follow such a  marriage? How outrageous would it be that you, whom nature created for  the universal good, should be devoted to one woman and plunged into such  disgrace? I loathe the thought of a marriage which would humiliate you.    Indeed, every possible effort which another woman in her place would  employ to make him marry her she used in order to dissuade him. Finally,  her sweet face streaming with tears, she uttered that tremendous  sentence which makes one really think that she loved him as no other  woman ever loved a man. She cried out, in an agony of self-sacrifice:    \"I would rather be your mistress than the wife even of an emperor!\"    Nevertheless, the two were married, and Abelard returned to his  lecture-room and to his studies. For months they met but seldom.
