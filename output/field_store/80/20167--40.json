Nine species of Penguins  occur on the coasts of Antarctic America, but one of these only is as  yet known to reach so far north as our limits.    We now come to the Crypturi or Tinamous, an order of birds commonly  supposed to be Gallinaceous, and generally confounded with \"Partridges\"  and \"Pheasants\" in the vernacular. They are, however, in some points of  essential structure more nearly allied to the Struthiones, although they  doubtless fill the same place in the economy of Neotropical Nature as  the true Gallinaceous birds in other lands. The Tinamous are spread all  over the Neotropical Region and number about 36 species. Eight of these  occur within the Argentine Republic; and amongst them we may pick out  the Martineta Tinamou (_Calodromas elegans_) and the three species of  the genus _Nothura_ as being specially characteristic Patagonian types.    Lastly, we come to the final order of the Neotropical Ornis in the shape  of the Rheas, or the American representatives of the Ostrich-type of  bird-life. The Rhea is, above all other birds, a most characteristic  representative of the Avifauna of the Patagonian subregion. It is true  that it ranges far north throughout the campos of Inner Brazil, where  the outlying members have become developed into an almost distinct  species or subspecies, _Rhea americana macrorhyncha_. But south of  the Rio Negro of Patagonia another very distinct type of Rhea, almost  subgenerically different, is met with and extends thence to the Straits  of Magellan. _Rhea_ has also been lately ascertained to occur on the  western side of the Andes in the Chilian province of Tarapaco; so  that this fine form of bird-life is diffused nearly over the entire  Patagonian subregion, and is well entitled to be termed one of the most  characteristic features of the Patagonian Avifauna.    In conclusion, therefore, we may sum up our present knowledge of the  Argentine Avifauna somewhat as follows:--    The Argentine Avifauna comprises 434 species of birds, referable to 54  families and genera.    All the twenty Orders of the Neotropical Avifauna have representatives  within its boundaries, except the _Opisthocomi_ or Hoatzins, which are  restricted to the Amazonian subregion.    The most numerous families of the Argentine Avifauna are, among the  Passeres, the Finches with 46 species, the Tyrants with 63 species, and  the Wood-hewers with 46 species. Among the remaining Orders, the Diurnal  Birds of Prey with 19 species, the Waterfowl with 22 species, the Rails  with 13 species, the Snipes with 15 species, and the Tinamous with 8  species, are likewise well represented.    Genera characteristic and proportionately numerous in species in the  Argentine Avifauna are _Poospiza_ and _Phrygilus_ among the Finches,  _Taenioptera_ and _Cnipolegus_ among the Tyrants, _Synallaxis_ among the  Wood-hewers, _Fulica_ among the Rails, and _Nothura_ among the Tinamous.  Less numerous in species, but highly characteristic forms of the  Argentine Ornis, are _Thinocorus_, _Rhynchotis_, and _Rhea_.    The following ten genera, mostly monotypic, are, so far as we know at  present, restricted to the limits of the Argentine Avifauna or its  immediate confines:--_Donacospiza_ and _Saltatricula_ (Fringillidae);  _Coryphistera_, _Anumbius_, _Limnornis_, and _Drymornis_  (Dendrocolaptidae); _Rhinocrypta_, with two species (Pteroptochidae);  _Spiziapteryx_ (Falconidae); _Chunga_ (Cariamidae); and _Calodromas_  (Tinamidae).          ARGENTINE ORNITHOLOGY.      Order I. PASSERES.    Suborder I. _OSCINES._    Fam. I. TURDIDAE, or THRUSHES.      Eight species of the almost cosmopolitan Thrush-family are known to  occur in the Argentine Republic. Of these, five belong to the  widely-spread genus _Turdus_, and are closely similar in structure to  our European Thrushes. The remaining three are Mock-birds (_Miminae_)--a  group restricted to the New World, and sometimes considered more nearly  allied to the Wrens. They are remarkable as splendid songsters.  Burmeister includes in his list a fourth species of _Mimus_ (_M.  thenca_), as found in the Mendoza district; but there may be some  error in this, as _M. thenca_ is only known to us from Chili west  of the Andes.      1.

La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 474 (Mendoza).        _Description._--Above olive-grey, tinged with brown on the head and      neck; beneath pale grey, throat white, more or less striped with      brown; middle of belly and crissum white; under wing-coverts and      inner margins of wing-feathers fulvous; bill yellow; feet hazel:      total length 9.0 inches, wing 4.5, tail 3.7. _Female_ similar.    _Hab._ Eastern South America, from Cayenne to Buenos Ayres.    The Dusky Thrush is widely distributed in South America, and ranges as  far south as Buenos Ayres, where it is quite common in the woods along  the Plata river. It is a shy forest-bird; a fruit- and insect-eater;  abrupt in its motions; runs rapidly on the ground with beak elevated,  and at intervals pauses and shakes its tail; pugnacious in temper;  strong on the wing, its flight not being over the trees, but masked  by their shadows. It can always be easily distinguished, even at a  distance, from other species by its peculiar short, metallic chirp--a  melodious sound indicating alarm or curiosity, and uttered before  flight--in contrast to the harsh screams and chuckling notes of other  Thrushes in this district.    Whether it is a fine singer or not within the tropics I am unable to  say, its vocal powers having received no attention from the naturalists  who have observed it. With us in the temperate climate of Buenos Ayres,  where it commences to sing in September, it has the finest song of  any bird I know, excepting only _Mimus triurus_. Like the English  Song-Thrush, but unlike its near neighbours the Red-bellied Thrush and  the Magellanic Thrush, it perches on the summit of a tree to sing. Its  song is, however, utterly unlike that of the English bird, which is  so fragmentary, and, as Mr. Barrows describes it, made up of \"vocal  attitudes and poses.\" The two birds differ also in voice as much as in  manner. The strains of the Dusky Thrush are poured forth in a continuous  stream, with all the hurry and freedom of the Sky-Lark's song; but  though so rapidly uttered, every note is distinct and clear, and the  voice singularly sweet and far-reaching. At intervals in the song there  recurs a two-syllabled note twice repeated, unlike in sound any other  bird-music I have heard, for it is purely metallic, and its joyous  bell-like \"_te-ling te-ling_\" always comes like a delightful surprise  to the listener, being in strange contrast with the prevailing tone.    The song is altogether a very fine one, its peculiar charm being that it  seems to combine two opposite qualities of bird-music, plaintiveness and  joyousness, in some indefinable manner.    I have never heard this species sing in a cage or anywhere near a human  habitation; and it is probably owing to its recluse habits that its  excellent song has not been hitherto noticed. Azara perhaps mistook the  song of this species for that of _Turdus rufiventris_, a very inferior  vocalist.    The nest is made in the centre of a thick bush or tree six or eight  feet above the ground, and is a deep elaborate structure, plastered  inside with mud, and lined with soft dry grass. The eggs are four in  number, oblong; the ground-colour light blue, abundantly marked with  reddish-brown spots.    This Thrush has, I believe, a partial migration in Buenos Ayres. In the  autumn and winter I have frequently observed it in localities where it  is never seen in summer.      2. TURDUS RUFIVENTRIS, Vieill.

B._ v. p. 222.        _Description._--Entire upper parts olive-grey; throat white, striped      with dark brown, the striped portion extending to the chest; rest of      under surface, also under wing-coverts, rufous-red, deepest on the      belly; bill brownish yellow; feet brown: total length 9.0 inches,      wing 4.6, tail 3.6. _Female_ similar.    _Hab._ S.E. Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and La Plata.    The Red-bellied Thrush, distinguished from the species just described  by its larger size and the bright rufous colour of its under plumage,  is common everywhere in the Plata region, and does not appear to be  migratory. It is a noisy, strong-winged, quarrelsome bird, closely  resembling the Dusky Thrush in its manners. It inhabits forests, runs  on the ground in search of food, and when approached darts away with  loud chuckling notes, flying close to the ground. These birds are also  often seen pursuing each other through the trees with loud harsh  screams.    The song has a faint resemblance to that of the English Song-Thrush,  being composed of a variety of notes uttered in the same disconnected  manner, with frequent pauses; but it is, both in sweetness and strength,  inferior to that of the English bird. As a rule this Thrush sings  concealed in a thick bush or tree.

The  grid was constructed and used by Mr. Harold R. Shepherd, Senior Game  Biologist, and his assistant, in the summers of 1961 and 1962, in a  study concerning the effect of rodents on browse plants used by deer.  The Department of Fish, Game and Parks allowed me to use the grid during  1963 and 1964, and also permitted me to use its Sherman live traps.    The grid is divided into 16 units, each with 28 stations (Fig. 2). Traps  at four stations (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d) are operated in each unit at the same  time, with two traps being set at each station. The traps are moved each  day in a counter-clockwise rotation to the next block of four stations  (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) within each unit. The stations are arranged so that on  any given night, traps in adjacent units are separated by at least 200  feet. As a result, animals are less inclined to become addicted to  traps, for even within one unit they must move at least 50 feet to be  caught on consecutive nights.        [Illustration: FIG. 2: Diagram of trapping grid for small mammals,         showing units of subdivision. Trapping stations were numbered         in each unit as shown in unit A.]    Traps were carefully shaded and a ball of kapok was placed in each trap  to provide protection against the killing temperatures that can develop  inside. In spite of these precautions, mice occasionally succumbed from  heat or cold. The traps were baited with coarsely-ground scratch feed.    Mammals trapped in the grid were inspected for molt, sexual maturity,  larvae of botflies, anomalies, and other pertinent data. Each animal was  marked by toe- and ear-clipping and then released. Four toes were used  on each front foot, and all five toes were used on each hind foot; two  toes were clipped on the right front foot to signify number nine. The  tip of the left ear was clipped to signify number 100, and the tip of  the right ear was clipped to signify 200. If 300 or more animals had  been captured, the tip of the tail would have been clipped to represent  number 300. A maximum of 799 animals could have been marked with this  system, which was used by Shepherd. I continued with it, starting my  listings with number one.    Only two mice were caught that had been marked in the previous season by  Shepherd.    Live traps were operated in the trapping grid from July 9 through  October 25, 1963, and from June 25 through August 21, 1964. Traps were  rotated through all stations five different times (35 days) in 1963, and  twice (14 days) in 1964. Approximately three man hours were required  each day to service and rotate the traps to the next group of stations.  By the autumn of 1964, a total of 282 mice had been captured, marked and  released; these were handled 817 times. In 1963, 235 mice were caught  for an average of 20 captures per day; in 1964, 47 mice were caught for  an average of 9 captures per day.      Calculations of Home Range    A diagrammatic map of the trapping grid was drawn to scale with one  centimeter equal to 100 linear feet. Trapping stations were numbered on  the diagram to correspond with stations in the field. An outline of this  drawing also was prepared to the same scale, but station numbers were  omitted. Mimeographed copies of such a form could be placed over the  diagrammatic map and marks made at each station where an animal was  caught. A separate form was kept for each animal that was caught four or  more times.    In calculating home range, it was assumed that animals would venture  half-way from the peripheral stations, at which they were caught, to the  next station outside the range. A circle having a scaled radius of 25  feet (half the distance between stations) was inscribed around each  station on the periphery of the home range by means of a drafting  compass. The estimated range for each animal was then outlined on the  form by connecting peripheries of the circles. Both the inclusive  boundary-strip method and the exclusive boundary-strip method (Stickel,  1954:3) were used to estimate the ranges. The area encompassed within  the home ranges was measured by planimetering the outline of the  drawing. At least two such readings were taken for each home range; then  these planimeter values were converted into square feet.    The customary practice in delimiting home ranges on a scaled map of a  grid is to inscribe squares around the peripheral stations at which the  animal was trapped, and then to connect the exterior corners of these  squares (Stickel, 1954:3). If the distance between stations was 50 feet,  such squares would have sides 50 feet long. An easier method is to  inscribe a circle having a scaled radius of 25 feet around the  peripheral stations by means of a drafting compass. To my knowledge this  method has not been used previously and consequently has not been tested  by experiments with artificial populations.    To test the accuracy of this method, a \"grid of traps\" was constructed  by using 8-1/2 by 11 inch sheets of graph paper with heavy lines each  centimeter. The intersects of the heavier lines were considered as trap  stations. A \"home range\" of circular shape, 200 feet (4 cm.) in  diameter, with an area of 31,146 square feet (0.71 acre), was cut from a  sheet of transparent plastic. Another \"home range\" was made in an oblong  shape with rounded ends. This range measured 2 by 65 centimeters (100 by  325 feet) and had an area of 32,102 square feet (0.74 acre). Each  plastic range was tossed at random on sheets of graph paper for fifty  trials each. The range was outlined on the graph paper, then circles  having a scaled radius of 25 feet were inscribed around each \"trap  station\" within the range. The peripheries of the inscribed circles were  then connected and the estimated home range was delimited by the  exclusive boundary-strip method. The estimated range was measured by  planimetering, and the data were compared with the known home range  (Table 2).    It was found that when calculated by the exclusive boundary-strip  method, the circular home range was overestimated by 2.22 per cent. The  oblong home range was overestimated by only 1.50 per cent. Stickel  (1954:4) has shown that the exclusive boundary-strip method is the most  accurate of several methods of estimating home ranges, and in her  experiments this method gave an overestimate of two per cent of the  known range. Thus, my method of encircling the peripheral stations  yields results that are, on the average, as accurate as the more  involved method of inscribing squares about the trap stations, and saves  a great deal of time as well. My method probably yields better accuracy;  a perfect circle is easily drawn by means of a compass, whereas a  perfect square is more difficult to construct without a template.    It is generally understood that the estimated home range of an animal  tends to increase in size with each additional capture; this increase is  rapid at first, then slows. Theoretically, the more often an animal is  captured, the more reliable is the estimate of its home range. Most  animals, however, rarely are captured more than a few times. The  investigator must decide how many captures are necessary before the data  seem to be valid for estimating home ranges.    An animal must be trapped at a minimum of three stations before its home  range can be estimated, and even then the area enclosed in the triangle  will be much less than the actual home range. Some investigators have  plotted home ranges from only three captures (Redman and Selander,  1958:391), whereas others consider that far more captures are needed to  make a valid estimate of range (Stickel, 1954:5).

The estimated home ranges of 10 individuals of _P. truei_,  each caught from eight to 13 times, were plotted and measured after each  capture from the fourth to the last. The percentage of the total  estimated range represented by the fourth through tenth captures was,  respectively, 52, 65, 73, 85, 88, 93, and 96 per cent.    Ninety-seven individuals of _P. maniculatus_ were caught from one to 10  times each. For five individuals that were each caught from seven to 10  times, the percentage of total estimated range represented by the fourth  through seventh captures was, respectively, 59, 69, 85, and 93 per cent.    The above percentages do not imply that the true home range of  individuals of these species can be reliably estimated after seven or 10  captures; the average percentages do, however, indicate a fairly rapid  increase in known size of home ranges between the fourth and tenth  captures. The estimated home ranges of _P. maniculatus_ tended to reach  maximum known size at about seven captures, whereas the estimated ranges  of _P. truei_ tended to attain maximum known size after nine or more  captures. The controversy over the number of captures of an individual  animal required for a reliable estimate of its home range was not  settled by my"]]]
