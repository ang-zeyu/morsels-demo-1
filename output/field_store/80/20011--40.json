He made his money in what he calls \"the Eastern Trade.\"  This,  so far as I can gather, takes in the Levant and all east of it.  I know  he has what they call in trade \"houses\" in all sorts of places--Turkey,  and Greece, and all round them, Morocco, Egypt, and Southern Russia, and  the Holy Land; then on to Persia, India, and all round it; the  Chersonese, China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands.  It is not to be  expected that we landowners can know much about trade, but my uncle  covers--or alas! I must say \"covered\"--a lot of ground, I can tell you.  Uncle Roger was a very grim sort of man, and only that I was brought up  to try and be kind to him I shouldn't ever have dared to speak to him.  But when was a child father and mother--especially mother--forced me to  go and see him and be affectionate to him.  He wasn't ever even civil to  me, that I can remember--grumpy old bear!  But, then, he never saw Rupert  at all, so that I take it Master R--- is out of the running altogether  for testamentary honours.  The last time I saw him myself he was  distinctly rude.  He treated me as a boy, though I was getting on for  eighteen years of age.  I came into his office without knocking; and  without looking up from his desk, where he was writing, he said: \"Get  out!  Why do you venture to disturb me when I'm busy?  Get out, and be  damned to you!\"  I waited where I was, ready to transfix him with my eye  when he should look up, for I cannot forget that when my father dies I  shall be Head of my House.  But when he did there was no transfixing  possible.  He said quite coolly:    \"Oh, it's you, is it?  I thought it was one of my office boys.  Sit down,  if you want to see me, and wait till I am ready.\"  So I sat down and  waited.  Father always said that I should try to conciliate and please my  uncle.  Father is a very shrewd man, and Uncle Roger is a very rich one.    But I don't think Uncle R--- is as shrewd as he thinks he is.  He  sometimes makes awful mistakes in business.  For instance, some years ago  he bought an enormous estate on the Adriatic, in the country they call  the \"Land of Blue Mountains.\"  At least, he says he bought it.  He told  father so in confidence.  But he didn't show any title-deeds, and I'm  greatly afraid he was \"had.\"  A bad job for me that he was, for father  believes he paid an enormous sum for it, and as I am his natural heir, it  reduces his available estate to so much less.    And now about Rupert.  As I have said, he ran away when he was about  fourteen, and we did not hear about him for years.  When we--or, rather,  my father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard.  He had gone as  a cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn.  Then he joined an  exploring party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in  Alaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands.  After that he went through  Central America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India,  and a lot of places.  We all know the wisdom of the adage that \"A rolling  stone gathers no moss\"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss,  Cousin Rupert will die a poor man.  Indeed, nothing will stand his  idiotic, boastful wastefulness.  Look at the way in which, when he came  of age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I  am sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as  Head of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not  pleased.  My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had  the sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is  not in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her  spirited conduct in the matter.  We never did think much of Rupert,  anyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a  dangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider.  We know what he  really is.  For my own part, I loathe and despise him.  Just now we are  irritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear  Uncle Roger's Will.  For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear  uncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to  know where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the  Will public, so we all have to wait.  It is especially hard on me, who am  the natural heir.  It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away  like that.  I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to  understand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir!  He said that  probably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not  know of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our  anxiety.  Our anxiety, forsooth!  We are not anxious; we only wish to  _know_.  And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of  thinking of the detestable and unfair death-duties, are anxious, we  should be so.  Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment  and set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper  without hope!                                    * * * * *    To-day we (father and I) had letters from Mr. Trent, telling us that the  whereabouts of \"Mr. Rupert Sent Leger\" had been discovered, and that a  letter disclosing the fact of poor Uncle Roger's death had been sent to  him.  He was at Titicaca when last heard of.  So goodness only knows when  he may get the letter, which \"asks him to come home at once, but only  gives to him such information about the Will as has already been given to  every member of the testator's family.\"  And that is nil.  I dare say we  shall be kept waiting for months before we get hold of the estate which  is ours.  It is too bad!    _Letter from Edward Bingham Trent to Ernest Roger Halbard Melton_.                                                    176, LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS,                                                        _December_ 28, 1906.        DEAR SIR,        I am glad to be able to inform you that I have just heard by letter      from Mr. Rupert St. Leger that he intended leaving Rio de Janeiro by      the S.S. _Amazon_, of the Royal Mail Company, on December 15.  He      further stated that he would cable just before leaving Rio de      Janeiro, to say on what day the ship was expected to arrive in      London.  As all the others possibly interested in the Will of the      late Roger Melton, and whose names are given to me in his      instructions regarding the reading of the Will, have been advised,      and have expressed their intention of being present at that event on      being apprised of the time and place, I now beg to inform you that by      cable message received the date scheduled for arrival at the Port of      London was January 1 prox.  I therefore beg to notify you, subject to      postponement due to the non-arrival of the _Amazon_, the reading of      the Will of the late Roger Melton, Esq., will take place in my office      on Thursday, January 3 prox., at eleven o'clock a.m.                                                 I have the honour to be, sir,                                                           Yours faithfully,                                                       EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT.

ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD.                                                              _January_ 4, 1907.    The reading of Uncle Roger's Will is over.  Father got a duplicate of Mr.  Trent's letter to me, and of the cable and two telegrams pasted into this  Record.  We both waited patiently till the third--that is, we did not say  anything.  The only impatient member of our family was my mother.  She  _did_ say things, and if old Trent had been here his ears would have been  red.  She said what ridiculous nonsense it was delaying the reading of  the Will, and keeping the Heir waiting for the arrival of an obscure  person who wasn't even a member of the family, inasmuch as he didn't bear  the name.  I don't think it's quite respectful to one who is some day to  be Head of the House!  I thought father was weakening in his patience  when he said: \"True, my dear--true!\" and got up and left the room.  Some  time afterwards when I passed the library I heard him walking up and  down.    Father and I went up to town on the afternoon of Wednesday, January 2.  We stayed, of course, at Claridge's, where we always stay when we go to  town.  Mother wanted to come, too, but father thought it better not.  She  would not agree to stay at home till we both promised to send her  separate telegrams after the reading.    At five minutes to eleven we entered Mr. Trent's office.  Father would  not go a moment earlier, as he said it was bad form to seem eager at any  time, but most of all at the reading of a will.  It was a rotten grind,  for we had to be walking all over the neighbourhood for half an hour  before it was time, not to be too early.    When we went into the room we found there General Sir Colin MacKelpie and  a big man, very bronzed, whom I took to be Rupert St. Leger--not a very  creditable connection to look at, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#5)"],[1,"and questioned them.  They were indignant at the random slur  Cast on my parentage and did their best  To comfort me, but still the venomed barb  Rankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.  So privily without their leave I went  To Delphi, and Apollo sent me back  Baulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.  But other grievous things he prophesied,  Woes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;  To wit I should defile my mother's bed  And raise up seed too loathsome to behold,  And slay the father from whose loins I sprang.  Then, lady,--thou shalt hear the very truth--  As I drew near the triple-branching roads,  A herald met me and a man who sat  In a car drawn by colts--as in thy tale--  The man in front and the old man himself  Threatened to thrust me rudely from the path,  Then jostled by the charioteer in wrath  I struck him, and the old man, seeing this,  Watched till I passed and from his car brought down  Full on my head the double-pointed goad.       Yet was I quits with him and more; one stroke  Of my good staff sufficed to fling him clean  Out of the chariot seat and laid him prone.  And so I slew them every one.  But if  Betwixt this stranger there was aught in common  With Laius, who more miserable than I,  What mortal could you find more god-abhorred?  Wretch whom no sojourner, no citizen  May harbor or address, whom all are bound  To harry from their homes.  And this same curse  Was laid on me, and laid by none but me.  Yea with  these hands all gory I pollute  The bed of him I slew.  Say, am I vile?  Am I not utterly unclean, a wretch  Doomed to be banished, and in banishment  Forgo the sight of all my dearest ones,  And never tread again my native earth;  Or else to wed my mother and slay my sire,  Polybus, who begat me and upreared?  If one should say, this is the handiwork  Of some inhuman power, who could blame  His judgment?  But, ye pure and awful gods,  Forbid, forbid that I should see that day!  May I be blotted out from living men  Ere such a plague spot set on me its brand!    CHORUS  We too, O king, are troubled; but till thou  Hast questioned the survivor, still hope on.    OEDIPUS  My hope is faint, but still enough survives  To bid me bide the coming of this herd.    JOCASTA  Suppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?    OEDIPUS  I'll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees  With thine, I shall have 'scaped calamity.    JOCASTA  And what of special import did I say?    OEDIPUS  In thy report of what the herdsman said  Laius was slain by robbers; now if he  Still speaks of robbers, not a robber, I  Slew him not; \"one\" with \"many\" cannot square.  But if he says one lonely wayfarer,  The last link wanting to my guilt is forged.    JOCASTA  Well, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,  Nor can he now retract what then he said;  Not I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.  E'en should he vary somewhat in his story,  He cannot make the death of Laius  In any wise jump with the oracle.  For Loxias said expressly he was doomed  To die by my child's hand, but he, poor babe,  He shed no blood, but perished first himself.  So much for divination.  Henceforth I  Will look for signs neither to right nor left.    OEDIPUS  Thou reasonest well.  Still I would have thee send  And fetch the bondsman hither.  See to it.    JOCASTA  That will I straightway.  Come, let us within.  I would do nothing that my lord mislikes.  [Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  My lot be still to lead       The life of innocence and fly  Irreverence in word or deed,       To follow still those laws ordained on high  Whose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky       No mortal birth they own,       Olympus their progenitor alone:  Ne'er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,  The god in them is strong and grows not old.    (Ant. 1)       Of insolence is bred  The tyrant; insolence full blown,       With empty riches surfeited,  Scales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.       Then topples o'er and lies in ruin prone;       No foothold on that dizzy steep.  But O may Heaven the true patriot keep  Who burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.  God is my help and hope, on him I wait.    (Str. 2)  But the proud sinner, or in word or deed,       That will not Justice heed,       Nor reverence the shrine       Of images divine,  Perdition seize his vain imaginings,       If, urged by greed profane,       He grasps at ill-got gain,  And lays an impious hand on holiest things.       Who when such deeds are done       Can hope heaven's bolts to shun?  If sin like this to honor can aspire,  Why dance I still and lead the sacred choir?    (Ant. 2)  No more I'll seek earth's central oracle,       Or Abae's hallowed cell,       Nor to Olympia bring       My votive offering.  If before all God's truth be not bade plain.       O Zeus, reveal thy might,       King, if thou'rt named aright  Omnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;       For Laius is forgot;       His weird, men heed it not;  Apollo is forsook and faith grows cold.  [Enter JOCASTA.]    JOCASTA  My lords, ye look amazed to see your queen  With wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.  I had a mind to visit the high shrines,  For Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed  With terrors manifold.  He will not use  His past experience, like a man of sense,  To judge the present need, but lends an ear  To any croaker if he augurs ill.  Since then my counsels naught avail, I turn  To thee, our present help in time of trouble,  Apollo, Lord Lycean, and to thee  My prayers and supplications here I bring.  Lighten us, lord, and cleanse us from this curse!  For now we all are cowed like mariners  Who see their helmsman dumbstruck in the storm.  [Enter Corinthian MESSENGER.]    MESSENGER  My masters, tell me where the palace is  Of Oedipus; or better, where's the king.    CHORUS  Here is the palace and he bides within;  This is his queen the mother of his children.    MESSENGER  All happiness attend her and the house,  Blessed is her husband and her marriage-bed.    JOCASTA  My greetings to thee, stranger; thy fair words  Deserve a like response.  But tell me why  Thou comest--what thy need or what thy news.    MESSENGER  Good for thy consort and the royal house.    JOCASTA  What may it be?  Whose messenger art thou?    MESSENGER  The Isthmian commons have resolved to make  Thy husband king--so 'twas reported there.    JOCASTA  What! is not aged Polybus still king?    MESSENGER  No, verily; he's dead and in his grave.    JOCASTA  What! is he dead, the sire of Oedipus?    MESSENGER  If I speak falsely, may I die myself.    JOCASTA  Quick, maiden, bear these tidings to my lord.  Ye god-sent oracles, where stand ye now!  This is the man whom Oedipus long shunned,  In dread to prove his murderer; and now  He dies in nature's course, not by his hand.  [Enter OEDIPUS.]    OEDIPUS  My wife, my queen, Jocasta, why hast thou  Summoned me from my palace?    JOCASTA                                Hear this man,  And as thou hearest judge what has become  Of all those awe-inspiring oracles.    OEDIPUS  Who is this man, and what his news for me?    JOCASTA  He comes from Corinth and his message this:  Thy father Polybus hath passed away.    OEDIPUS  What? let me have it, stranger, from thy mouth.    MESSENGER  If I must first make plain beyond a doubt  My message, know that Polybus is dead.    OEDIPUS  By treachery, or by sickness visited?    MESSENGER  One touch will send an old man to his rest.    OEDIPUS  So of some malady he died, poor man.    MESSENGER  Yes, having measured the full span of years.    OEDIPUS  Out on it, lady! why should one regard  The Pythian hearth or birds that scream i' the air?  Did they not point at me as doomed to slay  My father? but he's dead and in his grave  And here am I who ne'er unsheathed a sword;  Unless the longing for his absent son  Killed him and so _I_ slew him in a sense.  But, as they stand, the oracles are dead--  Dust, ashes, nothing, dead as Polybus.    JOCASTA  Say, did not I foretell this long ago?    OEDIPUS  Thou didst:  but I was misled by my fear.    JOCASTA  Then let I no more weigh upon thy soul.    OEDIPUS  Must I not fear my mother's marriage bed.    JOCASTA  Why should a mortal man, the sport of chance,  With no assured foreknowledge, be afraid?  Best live a careless life from hand to mouth.  This wedlock with thy mother fear not thou.  How oft it chances that in dreams a man  Has wed his mother!  He who least regards  Such brainsick phantasies lives most at ease.    OEDIPUS  I should have shared in full thy confidence,  Were not my mother living; since she lives  Though half convinced I still must live in dread.    JOCASTA  And yet thy sire's death lights out darkness much.    OEDIPUS  Much, but my fear is touching her who lives.    MESSENGER  Who may this woman be whom thus you fear?    OEDIPUS  Merope, stranger, wife of Polybus.    MESSENGER  And what of her can cause you any fear?    OEDIPUS  A heaven-sent oracle of dread import.    MESSENGER  A mystery, or may a stranger hear it?    OEDIPUS  Aye, 'tis no secret.  Loxias once foretold  That I should mate with mine own mother, and shed  With my own hands the blood of my own sire.  Hence Corinth was for many a year to me  A home distant; and I trove abroad,  But missed the sweetest sight, my parents' face.    MESSENGER  Was this the fear that exiled thee from home?    OEDIPUS  Yea, and the dread of slaying my own sire.    MESSENGER  Why, since I came to give thee pleasure, King,  Have I not rid thee of this second fear?    OEDIPUS  Well, thou shalt have due guerdon for thy pains.    MESSENGER  Well, I confess what chiefly made me come  Was hope to profit by thy coming home.    OEDIPUS  Nay, I will ne'er go near my parents more.    MESSENGER  My son, 'tis plain, thou know'st not what thou doest.    OEDIPUS  How so, old man?  For heaven's sake tell me all.    MESSENGER  If this is why thou dreadest to return.    OEDIPUS  Yea, lest the god's word be fulfilled in"]]]
