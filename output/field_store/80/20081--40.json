The  streets were almost forsaken in mid-afternoon. Business men hurried  from shelter to shelter; every dog remained at home; not a bird was to  be seen or heard. The sparrows had been forced to hide themselves in  crevices and holes; the doves found protected corners and huddled  together as best they could; many birds were frozen to death.    A dozen or more doves were gathered close under the cornice of the  piazza of a certain house, trying with little success to keep warm.  Some small sparrows, disturbed and driven from the cozy place they had  chosen, saw the doves and came flying across the piazza.    \"Dear doves,\" chirped the sparrows, \"won't you let us nestle near you?  Your bodies look so large and warm.\"    \"But your coats are frosted with cold. We cannot let you come near us,  for we are almost frozen now,\" murmured the doves sadly.    \"But we are perishing.\"    \"So are we.\"    \"It looks so warm near your broad wings, gentle doves. Oh, let us  come! We are so little, and so very, very cold!\"    \"Come,\" cooed a dove at last, and a trembling little sparrow fluttered  close and nestled under the broad white wing.    \"Come,\" cooed another dove, and another little sparrow found comfort.    \"Come! Come!\" echoed another warm-hearted bird, and another, until at  last more than half the doves were sheltering small, shivering  sparrows beneath their own half-frozen wings.    \"My sisters, you are very foolish,\" said the other doves. \"You mean  well, but why do you risk your own beautiful lives to give life to  worthless sparrows?\"    \"Ah! they were so small, and so very, very cold,\" murmured the doves.  \"Many of us will perish this cruel night; while we have life let us  share its meager warmth with those in bitter need.\"    Colder and colder grew the day. The sun went down behind the clouds  suffused with soft and radiant beauty, but more fiercely and  relentlessly swept the wind around the house where the doves and  sparrows waited for death.    An hour after sunset a man came up to the house and strode across the  piazza. As the door of the house closed heavily behind him, a little  child watching from the window saw something jarred from the cornice  fall heavily to the piazza floor.    \"Oh, papa,\" she cried in surprise, \"a poor frozen dove has fallen on  our porch!\"    When he stepped out to pick up the fallen dove the father saw the  others under the cornice. They were no longer able to move or to  utter a cry, so he brought them in and placed them in a room where  they might slowly revive. Soon more than half of the doves could coo  gratefully, and raise their stiffened wings. Then out from beneath the  wing of each revived dove fluttered a living sparrow.    \"Look, papa!\" cried the child. \"Each dove that has come to life was  holding a poor little sparrow close to her heart.\"    They gently raised the wings of the doves that could not be revived.  Not one had a sparrow beneath it.    Colder and fiercer swept the wind without, cutting and more piercing  grew the frozen, crystalline needles of air, but each dove that had  sheltered a frost-coated sparrow beneath her own shivering wings lived  to rejoice in the glowing gladsome sunshine of the days to come.          SNOWFLAKES          Out of the Bosom of the Air,        Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,      Over the woodlands brown and bare,        Over the harvest-fields forsaken,          Silent, and soft, and slow,          Descends the snow.                            Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.          THE SNOW-IMAGE    Nathaniel Hawthorne      One afternoon of a cold winter's day, when the sun shone forth with  chilly brightness, after a long storm, two children asked leave of  their mother to run out and play in the new-fallen snow.    The elder child was a little girl, whom, because she was of a tender  and modest disposition, and was thought to be very beautiful, her  parents, and other people who were familiar with her, used to call  Violet.    But her brother was known by the title of Peony, on account of the  ruddiness of his broad and round little phiz, which made everybody  think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers.    \"Yes, Violet--yes, my little Peony,\" said their kind mother; \"you may  go out and play in the new snow.\"    Forth sallied the two children, with a hop-skip-and-jump, that  carried them at once into the very heart of a huge snow-drift, whence  Violet emerged like a snow bunting, while little Peony floundered out  with his round face in full bloom.    Then what a merry time they had! To look at them, frolicking in the  wintry garden, you would have thought that the dark and pitiless storm  had been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new plaything for  Violet and Peony; and that they themselves had been created, as the  snowbirds were, to take delight only in the tempest and in the white  mantle which it spread over the earth.    At last, when they had frosted one another all over with handfuls of  snow, Violet, after laughing heartily at little Peony's figure, was  struck with a new idea.    \"You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony,\" said she, \"if your cheeks  were not so red. And that puts me in mind! Let us make an image out of  snow--an image of a little girl--and it shall be our sister, and shall  run about and play with us all winter long. Won't it be nice?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" cried Peony, as plainly as he could speak, for he was but  a little boy. \"That will be nice! And mamma shall see it.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Violet; \"mamma shall see the new little girl. But she  must not make her come into the warm parlour, for, you know, our  little snow-sister will not love the warmth.\"    And forthwith the children began this great business of making a  snow-image that should run about; while their mother, who was knitting  at the window and overheard some of their talk, could not help smiling  at the gravity with which they set about it. They really seemed to  imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live  little girl out of the snow.    Indeed, it was an exceedingly pleasant sight--those bright little  souls at their task! Moreover, it was really wonderful to observe how  knowingly and skillfully they managed the matter. Violet assumed the  chief direction, and told Peony what to do, while, with her own  delicate fingers, she shaped out all the nicer parts of the  snow-figure.    It seemed, in fact, not so much to be made by the children, as to  grow up under their hands, while they were playing and prattling about  it. Their mother was quite surprised at this, and the longer she  looked, the more and more surprised she grew.    Now, for a few moments, there was a busy and earnest but indistinct  hum of the two children's voices, as Violet and Peony wrought together  with one happy consent. Violet still seemed to be the guiding spirit,  while Peony acted rather as a labourer and brought her the snow from  far and near. And yet the little urchin evidently had a proper  understanding of the matter, too.    \"Peony, Peony!\" cried Violet; for her brother was at the other side of  the garden. \"Bring me those light wreaths of snow that have rested on  the lower branches of the pear-tree. You can clamber on the  snow-drift, Peony, and reach them easily. I must have them to make  some ringlets for our snow-sister's head!\"    \"Here they are, Violet!\" answered the little boy. \"Take care you do  not break them. Well done! Well done! How pretty!\"    \"Does she not look sweet?\" said Violet, with a very satisfied tone;  \"and now we must have some little shining bits of ice to make the  brightness of her eyes. She is not finished yet. Mamma will see how  very beautiful she is; but papa will say, 'Tush! nonsense! come in out  of the cold!'\"    \"Let us call mamma to look out,\" said Peony; and then he shouted,  \"Mamma! mamma!! mamma!!! Look out and see what a nice 'ittle girl we  are making!\"    \"What a nice playmate she will be for us all winter long!\" said  Violet. \"I hope papa will not be afraid of her giving us a cold!  Sha'n't you love her dearly, Peony?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" cried Peony. \"And I will hug her and she shall sit down  close by me and drink some of my warm milk.\"    \"Oh, no, Peony!\" answered Violet, with grave wisdom. \"That will not do  at all. Warm milk will not be wholesome for our little snow-sister.  Little snow-people like her eat nothing but icicles. No, no, Peony; we  must not give her anything warm to drink!\"    There was a minute or two of silence; for Peony, whose short legs  were never weary, had gone again to the other side of the garden. All  of a sudden, Violet cried out, loudly and joyfully, \"Look here, Peony!  Come quickly! A light has been shining on her cheek out of that  rose-coloured cloud! And the colour does not go away! Is not that  beautiful?\"    \"Yes, it is beau-ti-ful,\" answered Peony, pronouncing the three  syllables with deliberate accuracy. \"O Violet, only look at her hair!  It is all like gold!\"    \"Oh, certainly,\" said Violet, as if it were very much a matter of  course. \"That colour, you know, comes from the golden clouds that we  see up there in the sky. She is almost finished now. But her lips must  be made very red, redder than her cheeks. Perhaps, Peony, it will make  them red if we both kiss them!\"    Accordingly, the mother heard two smart little smacks, as if both her  children were kissing the snow-image on its frozen mouth. But, as this  did not seem to make the lips quite red enough, Violet next proposed  that the snow-child should be invited to kiss Peony's scarlet cheek.  \"Come, 'ittle snow-sister, kiss me!\" cried Peony.    \"There! she has kissed you,\" added Violet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#5)"],[1,"Spirit, the door of which shuts out sinful sense but          lets in Truth, Life, and Love. Closed to  15:6    error, it is open to Truth, and /vice versa/.          The Father in secret is unseen to the physical senses,          but He knows all things and rewards according to  15:9    motives, not according to speech. To enter into the          heart of prayer, the door of the erring senses must be          closed. Lips must be mute and materialism silent,  15:12   that man may have audience with Spirit, the divine          Principle, Love, which destroys all error.                              Effectual invocation            In order to pray aright, we must enter into the  15:15   closet and shut the door. We must close the lips and          silence the material senses. In the quiet          sanctuary of earnest longings, we must  15:18   deny sin and plead God's allness. We must resolve to          take up the cross, and go forth with honest hearts to          work and watch for wisdom, Truth, and Love. We  15:21   must \"pray without ceasing.\" Such prayer is an-          swered, in so far as we put our desires into practice.          The Master's injunction is, that we pray in secret and  15:24   let our lives attest our sincerity.                             Trustworthy beneficence            Christians rejoice in secret beauty and bounty, hidden          from the world, but known to God. Self-forgetfulness,  15:27   purity, and affection are constant prayers.          Practice not profession, understanding not          belief, gain the ear and right hand of omnipotence and  15:30   they assuredly call down infinite blessings. Trustworthi-          ness is the foundation of enlightened faith. Without a          fitness for holiness, we cannot receive holiness.                               Loftiest adoration    16:1    A great sacrifice of material things must precede this          advanced spiritual understanding. The highest prayer  16:3    is not one of faith merely; it is demonstra-          tion. Such prayer heals sickness, and must          destroy sin and death. It distinguishes between Truth  16:6    that is sinless and the falsity of sinful sense.                           The prayer of Jesus Christ            Our Master taught his disciples one brief prayer,          which we name after him the Lord's Prayer. Our Mas-  16:9    ter said, \"After this manner therefore pray          ye,\" and then he gave that prayer which          covers all human needs. There is indeed some doubt  16:12   among Bible scholars, whether the last line is not an          addition to the prayer by a later copyist; but this does          not affect the meaning of the prayer itself.    16:15   In the phrase, \"Deliver us from evil,\" the original          properly reads, \"Deliver us from the evil one.\" This          reading strengthens our scientific apprehension of the peti-  16:18   tion, for Christian Science teaches us that \"the evil one,\" or          one evil, is but another name for the first lie and all liars.            Only as we rise above all material sensuousness and  16:21   sin, can we reach the heaven-born aspiration and spir-          itual consciousness, which is indicated in the Lord's          Prayer and which instantaneously heals the sick.  16:24   Here let me give what I understand to be the spir-          itual sense of the Lord's Prayer:            Our Father which art in heaven,  16:27      /Our Father-Mother God, all-harmonious/,            Hallowed be Thy name.             /Adorable One./    16:30   Thy kingdom come.             /Thy kingdom is come; Thou art ever-present./    17:1    Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.             /Enable us to know,- as in heaven, so on earth,- God is  17:3          omnipotent, supreme/.            Give us this day our daily bread;             /Give us grace for to-day; feed the famished affections;/    17:6    And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.             /And Love is reflected in love;/            And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from  17:9         evil;             /And God leadeth us not into temptation, but delivereth               us from sin, disease, and death./    17:12   For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the               glory, forever.             /For God is infinite, all-power, all Life, Truth, Love, over               all, and All./                  CHAPTER II - ATONEMENT AND EUCHARIST            And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the          affections and lusts. - PAUL.            For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel.          - PAUL.            For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,          until the kingdom of God shall come. - JESUS.                                 Divine oneness    18:1    ATONEMENT is the exemplification of man's unity          with God, whereby man reflects divine Truth, Life,  18:3    and Love. Jesus of Nazareth taught and demonstrated          man's oneness with the Father, and for this we owe him          endless homage. His mission was both in-  18:6    dividual and collective. He did life's work          aright not only in justice to himself, but in mercy to          mortals,- to show them how to do theirs, but not to do  18:9    it for them nor to relieve them of a single responsibility.          Jesus acted boldly, against the accredited evidence of the          senses, against Pharisaical creeds and practices, and he  18:12   refuted all opponents with his healing power.                              Human reconciliation            The atonement of Christ reconciles man to God, not          God to man; for the divine Principle of Christ is God,  18:15   and how can God propitiate Himself? Christ          is Truth, which reaches no higher than itself.          The fountain can rise no higher than its source. Christ,  18:18   Truth, could conciliate no nature above his own, derived  19:1    from the eternal Love. It was therefore Christ's purpose          to reconcile man to God, not God to man. Love and  19:3    Truth are not at war with God's image and likeness.          Man cannot exceed divine Love, and so atone for him-          self. Even Christ cannot reconcile Truth to error, for  19:6    Truth and error are irreconcilable. Jesus aided in recon-          ciling man to God by giving man a truer sense of Love,          the divine Principle of Jesus' teachings, and this truer  19:9    sense of Love redeems man from the law of matter,          sin, and death by the law of Spirit,- the law of divine          Love.    19:12   The Master forbore not to speak the whole truth, de-          claring precisely what would destroy sickness, sin, and          death, although his teaching set households at variance,  19:15   and brought to material beliefs not peace, but a          sword.                             Efficacious repentance            Every pang of repentance and suffering, every effort  19:18   for reform, every good thought and deed, will help us to          understand Jesus' atonement for sin and aid          its efficacy; but if the sinner continues to pray  19:21   and repent, sin and be sorry, he has little part in the atone-          ment,- in the /at-one-ment/ with God,- for he lacks the          practical repentance, which reforms the heart and enables  19:24   man to do the will of wisdom. Those who cannot dem-          onstrate, at least in part, the divine Principle of the teach-          ings and practice of our Master have no part in God. If  19:27   living in disobedience to Him, we ought to feel no secur-          ity, although God is good.                              Jesus' sinless career            Jesus urged the commandment, \"Thou shalt have no  19:30   other gods before me,\" which may be ren-          dered: Thou shalt have no belief of Life as          mortal; thou shalt not know evil, for there is one Life,-  20:1    even God, good. He rendered \"unto Caesar the things          which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are  20:3    God's.\" He at last paid no homage to forms of doctrine          or to theories of man, but acted and spake as he was moved,          not by spirits but by Spirit.    20:6    To the ritualistic priest and hypocritical Pharisee          Jesus said, \"The publicans and the harlots go into the          kingdom of God before you.\" Jesus' history made a  20:9    new calendar, which we call the Christian era; but he          established no ritualistic worship. He knew that men          can be baptized, partake of the Eucharist, support the  20:12   clergy, observe the Sabbath, make long prayers, and yet          be sensual and sinful.                                 Perfect example            Jesus bore our infirmities; he knew the error of mortal  20:15   belief, and \"with his stripes [the rejection of error] we are          healed.\" \"Despised and rejected of men,\"          returning blessing for cursing, he taught mor-  20:18   tals the opposite of themselves, even the nature of God;          and when error felt the power of Truth, the scourge and          the cross awaited the great Teacher. Yet he swerved not,  20:21   well knowing that to obey the divine order and trust God,          saves retracing and traversing anew the path from sin to          holiness.                               Behest of the cross    20:24   Material belief is slow to acknowledge what the          spiritual fact implies. The truth is the centre of all          religion. It commands sure entrance into  20:27   the realm of Love. St. Paul wrote, \"Let us          lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so          easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that  20:30   is set before us;\" that is, let us put aside material self          and sense, and seek the divine Principle and Science of          all healing.
