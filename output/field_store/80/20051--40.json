My theory is as follows:--    Up to 100 yards the range is point-blank, that is, aim direct on the  bull's eye; for 200 yards, raise the muzzle, say one foot above the  bull's eye; for 300 yards, two feet above the bull's eye, and so on. A  few trial-shots will soon settle the question, and practice makes  perfect. A man will thus be independent of the back-sight of his rifle.  This refers to shooting in the open. Of course, under cover, when time  and circumstances admit, the back-sight can be used with great  advantage.    A man in shooting with a pistol or revolver has to judge his own  distance and the necessary elevation. Why should not the same rule apply  directly to the rifle? I have seen excellent practice at 400 yards with  a Snider carbine, back-sight level, the man judging his own elevation,  and have been very successful myself, and have found the above rule  apply, with slight variations.    In rifle contests all artificial nonsense, such as coloured glasses,  eye-shades, kneeling upon eider-down quilts, firing from shaded tents,  blackening sights, &c., should be discouraged. Let a man leave all such  effeminacy and tomfoolery at home, and shoot like a man, taking  circumstances as he would find them in the open field _with an enemy_  before him, using such cover only as nature and circumstances provide.    There is infinite satisfaction attached to the winning of an honour,  when that honour has to be obtained under difficulties which must be  surmounted. The more difficult the task is, the more merit in overcoming  it.    Lastly. All firearms require constant attention, and should be kept  clean. After use they should be immediately attended to, and never put  away dirty; should be kept in some dry corner where rust cannot destroy,  and they should be occasionally overhauled and oiled when necessary.  Really valuable weapons are sometimes ruined by neglect. The man who  takes no pride in his gun is no sportsman.      FOOTNOTES:    [A] I have known instances of pistols and fowling-pieces hanging fire  for two or three seconds after the hammer has fallen, and then suddenly  go off.
