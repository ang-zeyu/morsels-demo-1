[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44"],[0,"The Song of the Lark (#5)"],[1,"piano; so  twice a week in summer and once a week in winter Thea went over the  gulch to the Kohlers', though the Ladies' Aid Society thought it was not  proper for their preacher's daughter to go \"where there was so much  drinking.\" Not that the Kohler sons ever so much as looked at a glass of  beer. They were ashamed of their old folks and got out into the world as  fast as possible; had their clothes made by a Denver tailor and their  necks shaved up under their hair and forgot the past. Old Fritz and  Wunsch, however, indulged in a friendly bottle pretty often. The two men  were like comrades; perhaps the bond between them was the glass wherein  lost hopes are found; perhaps it was common memories of another country;  perhaps it was the grapevine in the garden--knotty, fibrous shrub, full  of homesickness and sentiment, which the Germans have carried around the  world with them.    As Thea approached the house she peeped between the pink sprays of the  tamarisk hedge and saw the Professor and Mrs. Kohler in the garden,  spading and raking. The garden looked like a relief-map now, and gave no  indication of what it would be in August; such a jungle! Pole beans and  potatoes and corn and leeks and kale and red cabbage--there would even  be vegetables for which there is no American name. Mrs. Kohler was  always getting by mail packages of seeds from Freeport and from the old  country. Then the flowers! There were big sunflowers for the canary  bird, tiger lilies and phlox and zinnias and lady's-slippers and  portulaca and hollyhocks,--giant hollyhocks. Beside the fruit trees  there was a great umbrella-shaped catalpa, and a balm-of-Gilead, two  lindens, and even a ginka,--a rigid, pointed tree with leaves shaped  like butterflies, which shivered, but never bent to the wind.    This morning Thea saw to her delight that the two oleander trees, one  white and one red, had been brought up from their winter quarters in the  cellar. There is hardly a German family in the most arid parts of Utah,  New Mexico, Arizona, but has its oleander trees. However loutish the  American-born sons of the family may be, there was never one who refused  to give his muscle to the back-breaking task of getting those tubbed  trees down into the cellar in the fall and up into the sunlight in the  spring. They may strive to avert the day, but they grapple with the tub  at last.    When Thea entered the gate, her professor leaned his spade against the  white post that supported the turreted dove-house, and wiped his face  with his shirt-sleeve; someway he never managed to have a handkerchief  about him. Wunsch was short and stocky, with something rough and  bear-like about his shoulders. His face was a dark, bricky red, deeply  creased rather than wrinkled, and the skin was like loose leather over  his neck band--he wore a brass collar button but no collar. His hair was  cropped close; iron-gray bristles on a bullet-like head. His eyes were  always suffused and bloodshot. He had a coarse, scornful mouth, and  irregular, yellow teeth, much worn at the edges. His hands were square  and red, seldom clean, but always alive, impatient, even sympathetic.    \"MORGEN,\" he greeted his pupil in a businesslike way, put on a black  alpaca coat, and conducted her at once to the piano in Mrs. Kohler's  sitting-room. He twirled the stool to the proper height, pointed to it,  and sat down in a wooden chair beside Thea.    \"The scale of B flat major,\" he directed, and then fell into an attitude  of deep attention. Without a word his pupil set to work.    To Mrs. Kohler, in the garden, came the cheerful sound of effort, of  vigorous striving. Unconsciously she wielded her rake more lightly.  Occasionally she heard the teacher's voice. \"Scale of E minor...WEITER,  WEITER!...IMMER I hear the thumb, like a lame foot. WEITER...WEITER,  once...SCHON! The chords, quick!\"    The pupil did not open her mouth until they began the second movement of  the Clementi sonata, when she remonstrated in low tones about the way he  had marked the fingering of a passage.    \"It makes no matter what you think,\" replied her teacher coldly. \"There  is only one right way. The thumb there. EIN, ZWEI, DREI, VIER,\" etc.  Then for an hour there was no further interruption.    At the end of the lesson Thea turned on her stool and leaned her arm on  the keyboard. They usually had a little talk after the lesson.    Herr Wunsch grinned. \"How soon is it you are free from school? Then we  make ahead faster, eh?\"    \"First week in June. Then will you give me the 'Invitation to the  Dance'?\"    He shrugged his shoulders. \"It makes no matter. If you want him, you  play him out of lesson hours.\"    \"All right.\" Thea fumbled in her pocket and brought out a crumpled slip  of paper. \"What does this mean, please? I guess it's Latin.\"    Wunsch blinked at the line penciled on the paper. \"Wherefrom you get  this?\" he asked gruffly.    \"Out of a book Dr. Archie gave me to read. It's all English but that.  Did you ever see it before?\" she asked, watching his face.    \"Yes. A long time ago,\" he muttered, scowling. \"Ovidius!\" He took a stub  of lead pencil from his vest pocket, steadied his hand by a visible  effort, and under the words:    \"LENTE CURRITE, LENTE CURRITE, NOCTIS EQUI,\" he wrote in a clear,  elegant Gothic hand,--    \"GO SLOWLY, GO SLOWLY, YE STEEDS OF THE NIGHT.\"    He put the pencil back in his pocket and continued to stare at the  Latin. It recalled the poem, which he had read as a student, and thought  very fine. There were treasures of memory which no lodging-house keeper  could attach. One carried things about in one's head, long after one's  linen could be smuggled out in a tuning-bag. He handed the paper back  to Thea. \"There is the English, quite elegant,\" he said, rising.    Mrs. Kohler stuck her head in at the door, and Thea slid off the stool.  \"Come in, Mrs. Kohler,\" she called, \"and show me the piece-picture.\"    The old woman laughed, pulled off her big gardening gloves, and pushed  Thea to the lounge before the object of her delight. The  \"piece-picture,\" which hung on the wall and nearly covered one whole end  of the room, was the handiwork of Fritz Kohler. He had learned his trade  under an old-fashioned tailor in Magdeburg who required from each of his  apprentices a thesis: that is, before they left his shop, each  apprentice had to copy in cloth some well known German painting,  stitching bits of colored stuff together on a linen background; a kind  of mosaic. The pupil was allowed to select his subject, and Fritz Kohler  had chosen a popular painting of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. The  gloomy Emperor and his staff were represented as crossing a stone  bridge, and behind them was the blazing city, the walls and fortresses  done in gray cloth with orange tongues of flame darting about the domes  and minarets. Napoleon rode his white horse; Murat, in Oriental dress, a  bay charger. Thea was never tired of examining this work, of hearing how  long it had taken Fritz to make it, how much it had been admired, and  what narrow escapes it had had from moths and fire. Silk, Mrs. Kohler  explained, would have been much easier to manage than woolen cloth, in  which it was often hard to get the right shades. The reins of the  horses, the wheels of the spurs, the brooding eyebrows of the Emperor,  Murat's fierce mustaches, the great shakos of the Guard, were all worked  out with the minutest fidelity. Thea's admiration for this picture had  endeared her to Mrs. Kohler. It was now many years since she used to  point out its wonders to her own little boys. As Mrs. Kohler did not go  to church, she never heard any singing, except the songs that floated  over from Mexican Town, and Thea often sang for her after the lesson was  over. This morning Wunsch pointed to the piano.    \"On Sunday, when I go by the church, I hear you sing something.\"    Thea obediently sat down on the stool again and began, \"COME, YE  DISCONSOLATE.\" Wunsch listened thoughtfully, his hands on his knees.  Such a beautiful child's voice! Old Mrs. Kohler's face relaxed in a  smile of happiness; she half closed her eyes. A big fly was darting in  and out of the window; the sunlight made a golden pool on the rag carpet  and bathed the faded cretonne pillows on the lounge, under the  piece-picture. \"EARTH HAS NO SORROW THAT HEAVEN CANNOT HEAL,\" the song  died away.    \"That is a good thing to remember,\" Wunsch shook himself. \"You believe  that?\" looking quizzically at Thea.    She became confused and pecked nervously at a black key with her middle  finger. \"I don't know. I guess so,\" she murmured.    Her teacher rose abruptly. \"Remember, for next time, thirds. You ought  to get up earlier.\"    That night the air was so warm that Fritz and Herr Wunsch had their  after-supper pipe in the grape arbor, smoking in silence while the sound  of fiddles and guitars came across the ravine from Mexican Town. Long  after Fritz and his old Paulina had gone to bed, Wunsch sat motionless  in the arbor, looking up through the woolly vine leaves at the  glittering machinery of heaven.    \"LENTE CURRITE, NOCTIS EQUI.\"    That line awoke many memories. He was thinking of youth; of his own, so  long gone by, and of his pupil's, just beginning. He would even have  cherished hopes for her, except that he had become superstitious. He  believed that whatever he hoped for was destined not to be; that his  affection brought ill-fortune, especially to the young; that if he held  anything in his thoughts, he harmed it. He had taught in music schools  in St. Louis and Kansas City, where the shallowness and complacency of  the young misses had maddened him. He had encountered bad manners and  bad faith, had been the victim of sharpers of all kinds, was dogged by  bad luck. He had played in orchestras that were never paid and wandering  opera troupes which disbanded penniless. And there was always the old  enemy, more relentless than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#5)"],[1,"s, and its worship is  her religion.'    It must be admitted that he offered himself a cross illustration to his  own text.  The desperate concession wrung from him last night in a  moment of vinous exaltation, had found his sober morning senses under a  mountain of depression.  He was bitterly aggrieved against fate; yet the  only quarrel he had with himself was for that mad vow of temperance, not  for the vice which had exacted it of him.  The tongue in his head was  like a heater in an iron.  Tantalus draughts lipped and bubbled against  his palate.  The parched soil of his heart, he felt, would never again  blossom in little lonely oases--never again know the solace of dreams  aloof from the world.  His traffic being by no means with heaven, God,  he supposed, had sent an angel to convert it.  And he had succumbed  through the angel's calling him--mother!    He struck his hollow breast with a wild laugh.  He groaned over the  memory of that emotional folly.  He damned himself, his trade, his  employer, his aching head--everything and every one, in short, but the  author of his misery.  Him he could not curse--not more than if that  preposterous relationship between them had been real. Neither did he  once dream of violating his word to him, since it had been given--absurd  thought--to his child.    He was none the less savage against circumstance--vicious, desperate,  insolent with his master, as cross all over as a Good Friday bun.  Messer Lanti, himself in a curiously sober mood, indulged his most acrid  sallies with a good-humoured tolerance which, contemptuously oblivious  as it was of any late smart of his own inflicting, was harder than the  blow itself in its implication of a fault overlooked.    'Rally, Cicca!' said he, as they were preparing to horse; 'look'st as  sour as a green crab.  What! if we are to ride with Folly, give us a  fool's text for the journey, man.'    Cicada dwelt a moment on his stirrup, looking round banefully.    'And who to illustrate it, lord?'    'Why, thy lord, if thou wilt,' said Carlo.  'He will be no curmudgeon in  a bid for laughter.'    The Fool gained his mule's saddle, and digging heels into the beast's  flanks, drove forward.  Lanti, with a whoop, spurred alongside of him.  Cicada slowed to a stop.    'Hast overtaken Folly, master?' said he, with a leer. 'I knew you would  not be long.'    Carlo scratched his head.  The Fool turned and rode back; so did the  other.  By the brook-side little Bembo was preparing to mount a steed  with which he had been accommodated, since the lady had peremptorily  declined to ride pillion to him again.  Cicada referred to him with a  gesture.    'For us,' he said, 'we are two fools in a leash, sith Sanctity, stopping  where he was, is at the goal before us.'    Lanti grumbled: 'O, if this is a text!' and beat his wits desperately.    'A text, sirrah!' he roared, 'a text for the journey.'    'I will rhyme it you,' said the Fool imperturbably, pointing his bauble  at Madam Beatrice, who at the moment stepped from the green tent:--        'Nothing is gained to start apace,      After another hath won the race.    Shall you and I be jogging, master?'    Lanti raised his whip furiously.  Cicada, slipping from his mule, dodged  behind Bembo.    'Save me!' he squealed, 'save me!  I am sound.  It is folly to give a  sound man a tonic.'    Carlo burst into a vexed laugh.    'Well,' said he, 'go to.  I think I am in a rare mood for charity.'    The little party breakfasted on cups of clear water from the spring,  and, in the fresh of the morning, folded its tents and started leisurely  on the final stages of its journey.  Madonna, lazy-lidded, sat her  palfrey like a vine-goddess.  Her bosom rose and fell in absolute  tranquillity.  She bestirred herself only, when Bembo rode near, to  lavish ostentatious fondness on her Carlo, a regard which her Carlo  repaid with a like ostentation of attention towards his little saint.  It was an open conspiracy of souls, bared to one another, to justify  their nakedness before heaven; only the woman carried off her shame with  an air.  Bernardo she ignored loftily; but her heart was busy, under all  its calm exterior, with a poisonous point of vengeance.    Presently, the sun striking hot, she dismounted and withdrew into her  litter, a miniature long waggon, drawn on rude wheels by a yoke of  sleepy oxen, and having an embroidered tilt opening to the side.  A  groom, walking there in attendance, led her palfrey by the bridle.  Lanti and his guest, with the Fool for company, rode a distance ahead.  The young nobleman was thoughtful and silent; yet it was obvious that  he, with the others, felt the relief of that secession.  Bernardo broke  into a bright laugh, and rallied Cicada on his glumness.    'Why should I be merry,' said the jester, with a sour face, 'when I was  invited to a feast, and threatened with a cudgelling for attending?'    Bernardo looked at him lovingly.  He thought this was some allusion to  his self-enforced abstinence.    'Dear Cicca,' said he, 'the feast was not worth the reckoning.'    'O, was it not!' cried Cicada with a hoarse crow. 'But I spoke of my  lord's brains, which, by the token, are the right flap-doodle.'    He put Bembo between himself and Lanti.    'Judge between us,' he cried, 'judge between us, Messer Parablist.  He  offered to serve himself up to me, and, when I had no more than opened  my mouth, was already at my ribs.'    Carlo, on the further side, laughed loud.    'It is always the same here,' grumbled the Fool. 'They will have our  stings drawn like snakes' before they will sport with us.  They love not  in this Italy the joke which tells against themselves--of that a poor  motley must ware.  It muzzles him, muzzles him--drives the poison down  and in; and you wonder at the bile in my face!'    He fell back, having uttered his snarl, with politic suddenness, and  posted to the rear of the litter.  The moment he was away, Bembo turned  upon his host with a kindling look of affection.    'I am glad to have thee alone one moment,' said he. 'O Carlo, dear! the  base bright metal so to seduce thine eyes.  Are they not opened?'    Now the tale of madam's discomfiture at her amoroso's hands the night  before had not been long in reaching the boy's ears.  She had not  deigned, equally in confessing her predilections as her shame, to utter  them out of the common hearing.  Modesty in intrigue was a paradox; and,  in any case, one could undress without emotion in the presence of one's  dogs.    So Cicada, putting two and two together, had gathered the whole story,  and given this spiritual bantling of his a hint as to his wise policy  thereon, scarce a sentence of which had he uttered before he was casting  down his eyes and mumbling inarticulate under the piercing gaze of an  honesty which would have been even less effective had it spoken.  Then  had he slunk away, blessing all beatitudes whose innocence entailed such  responsibilities on their worshippers; and, as a result, here was Master  Truth taking his own course with the problem.    Messer Lanti's eyes opened indeed to hear truth so fearless; but he made  an acrid face.    'On my soul!' he muttered, glistening, and stopped, and his brow was  shadowed a moment under a devil's wing.  Then suddenly, with an oath, he  clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped a furlong, and, circling, came  back at a trot, and falling again alongside, put a quite gentle hand on  the boy's bridle arm.    'Dear, pretty Messer Truth,' said he, 'I pray you, on my sincerity, turn  your horse's head.  Whither, think you, are you making?'    'Why, for heaven, I hope, Carlo,' said the boy with a smile.    'Milan is not the gate to it,' answered the rough voice, quite  entreatingly.  'Go back, I advise you.  You will break your heart on the  stones.  Why, look here: dost think I am so concerned to have this  intrigue proved the common stuff of passion?  I care not the feather in  thy cap, Bernardino.  Nay, I am the better for it, sith it opens the way  to a change.  And so with ten thousand others.  There is the measure of  your task.  Now, will you go back?'    'No, by my faith!'    Lanti growled, and grunted, and smacked his thigh.    'Then I cannot help thee: and yet I will help thee. Saint Ambrose!  To  remodel the world to goodwill, statecraft and all, on the lisp of a red  mouth!  Wilt be the fashion for just a year and a day, shouldering us,  every one, poor gallants, to the wall?  Why should I love thee for that?  and I love thee nevertheless.  There thou goest in a silken doublet, to  whip all hell with a lute-string; and I--I had shown less temerity  horsed and armoured, and with a whole roaring crusade at my back.'    Bembo smiled very kindly.    'Christ's love was all _His_ sword and buckler,' said he.    'And He was crucified,' said Carlo grimly.    'And died a virgin,' answered the boy, 'that He might make for ever  chaste Love His heir.'    'Well,' grumbled Lanti, 'there reigns an impostor these fourteen hundred  years or so in His place, that's all.  I hope the right heir may prove  his title.  'Tis a long tenure to dispossess.  Methinks men have  forgotten.'    'Yes, they have forgotten,' said the boy; and he began to sing so  sweetly as he rode, that the other, after a grunt or two, sunk into a  mere grudging rapture of listening.    In the meantime, sombre and taciturn, the Fool rode in the rear.  Before  him hulked the great shoulders, stoppered with the little round head, of  Narcisso, the groom who led Madonna's palfrey.  Cicada, regarding this  beauty, snarled out a laugh to himself.  'Sure never,' he thought, 'was  parental fondness worse bestowed than in nicknaming such a satyr.'  The  creature's small, bony jaw, like a pike's, underhung, black-tufted,  viciousness incarnate; his pursed, overlapping brow, with the dirty  specks of eyes set fixedly in the under-hollows--in all, the mean  smallness of his features,"]]]
