The area within  which routine daily movements are confined constitutes the home range,  which is variable in size and shape. An individual may, and usually  does, alter its home range over periods of time. The home range is  somewhat nebulous because the rat may at any time move far beyond the  small area to which its activities are largely confined. It may be  motivated by sexual urge or other voluntary wandering; it may be  enticed by a food supply or some other specific attraction not available  near its house; or it may be forcibly displaced by an intruder or may  abandon in favor of an offspring.    An occupied house normally has several runways radiating from it. These  are well worn paths, smoothed by use, and cleared of obstructions, and  the rat tends to keep to them in its foraging expeditions. Usually a  trail leads to a bush or tree showing evidence of heavy use by the rat.  Ordinarily such a trail cannot be traced more than 30 feet from the  house, and it seems that the most concentrated foraging occurs within  this short radius. Experience in live-trapping has indicated that the  distance covered by a woodrat in its normal foraging for food is  ordinarily less than 75 feet in any direction from the house.    Usually the rats can be caught in traps only at their houses or nearby  places that they frequent, as indicated by their sign. When travelling,  woodrats make use of overhead cover as much as possible. Storing of food  seems to be associated with the animal's reluctance to wander far from  home. When a rat is gathering preferred food for storage the home range  may be enlarged (or the animal may travel beyond the limits of its  regular home range). In any case the rat may find it necessary to  traverse an additional area in order to reach the food source. This may  involve, in part, extension vertically, as when the rat obtains food  from trees directly over the house. The home range is thus somewhat  three-dimensional; both trails and feeding places are often above  ground. Because of dependency on cover, woodrats do not forage randomly  in all directions from the house.    Although the house and its immediate environs are defended as a  territory by the occupant, possession may be soon relinquished. A  woodrat may shift frequently from one house to another, especially if  unoccupied houses are readily available. Because woodrats had undergone  drastic reduction in numbers, as discussed on p. 505, unoccupied houses  in various stages of disrepair were numerous throughout the woodland in  1948 and 1949, and the rats that were present then seemed especially  inclined to wander. Even old houses that are collapsed and  disintegrating may be used temporarily, or may be taken over and  repaired. Houses that are in sites exceptionally favorable in that they  provide food and shelter may be occupied more or less permanently, with  a succession of woodrats over many generations.    Shifts to new areas are perhaps most often motivated by a search for  mates. Such shifts are, on the average, longer and more frequent in  males. Males must range farther in search of females when numbers are  low. On the other hand, when numbers are high and most of the best sites  are occupied, newly independent young and displaced adults are forced to  travel greater distances in search of homes. Some of the larger and more  powerful males move far greater distances than smaller males. The  longest distances recorded were mostly for large adult males in breeding  condition. The average maximum distance between successive points of  capture for 27 adult males was 345 feet. For 39 females (adults and  subadults) the corresponding figure was 143 feet. The extremes for males  were 0 to 1080 feet and for females, 0 to 650 feet. Of the 27 males,  five moved the maximum distance in a single night. Most of the long  movements by males did not constitute clear-cut shifts in home range,  and many returned to their original locations.    The average distance between points of first and last captures for 72  subadult and adult males was 165 feet. A similar figure for 72 subadult  and adult females was 133 feet. Of the males 23.7 per cent were at the  same place at the first and last captures; for females the percentage  was 36.1. These figures are from the combined data of our trapping  records, but the trends differed sharply in the two sets of records. In  Fitch's records, movements averaged longer and difference between the  sexes was much less: 189 feet for 41 males and 178 feet for 42 females.  Corresponding figures from Rainey's records were: 141 feet for 31 males  and 74 feet for 30 females. In Fitch's field work, opportunities to  record exceptionally long movements obviously were better because the  trap line encompassed a larger area, approximately half a square mile,  whereas Rainey's live-trapping was concentrated on relatively small  areas. The reason for the greater vagility of females in Fitch's records  is less evident. However, the data were obtained within the period of  drastic population reduction, at a time when there were numerous empty  houses throughout the woodland, facilitating travel, and shifts from one  home range to another where conditions were, temporarily at least, more  favorable. Rainey found that the females in the small colony in woodland  where he trapped, moved much less than did those that lived along the  hilltop outcrop, which provided a natural travel route.    Following are several examples of males and females with long histories  showing individual variation in frequency and distance of movements.         _Males_         (1.) First captured October 14, 1951, and last captured 327       days later on September 6, 1952. He was taken 12 times. For       the first seven captures (October 14, 1951, to July 15,       1952), no movements were recorded. In the following seven       days he moved 367 feet. Within the next 21 days he returned       to within 114 feet of the site of original capture. Less       than one month later he was caught for the last time, at       this same site.         (2.) This large male was captured twelve times over a period       of 827 days (March 16, 1952, to June 21, 1954). He tended to       wander more than other males and was absent from the       trapping area from early 1952 to May 1953. One round trip       made in a two-weeks period, amounted to a linear distance of       1894 feet if the rat followed natural cover. The return trip       of 947 feet was the greatest distance traversed in a single       night in any of the woodrats we recorded. Other movements       between successive captures were: 722, 397, 356, 293, 253       and 144 feet (the latter shift made three different times).       Sexual urge probably motivated most of his wandering, since       numbers of females were low.         (3.) For this male the span of records was 143 days, with 18       captures. For the first eight recaptures, extending over a       period of 39 days, he was still at the original location.       Four days later he had moved 120 feet and was visiting a       female. A week later he returned. In the following month he       was recorded as making two more moves, of 115 feet and 215       feet. He was last recorded at the hilltop outcrop.         (4.) The records of this male extended over 465 days, with       13 captures. For the entire period only one movement, of 163       feet, was recorded. Twelve of the 13 captures were at the       same house.         (5.) This male was captured 16 times over a span of 130       days. After the second capture he moved 144 feet along the       outcrop and was caught there for the next 14 times, having       developed a \"trap habit.\"         (6.) This male was in the area 210 days (13 captures) and       shifted his range. He was first captured on August 17, 1952,       at a house at the rock fence 433 feet from the outcrop.       Between this date and October 12, 1952, he moved to the       outcrop and established residence in a vacant house. He was       recorded as making six more moves, the longest of which was       only 40 feet.         (7.) This male was first caught in June, 1949, as a juvenile       probably between two and three months old (weighing 96       grams) and hence probably still at the maternal house. In       September, grown to adult size, he was caught twice, still       at this same place. In October, November, December, and in       February, 1950, he was caught 11 times at eight places all       within a 90-foot radius of his original location. In April,       1950, he was caught at points 550 feet WSW and 700 feet SW.       In October he was caught within 150 feet of the original       location. In November, 1950, and in March and April, 1951,       he was caught four times at a place 900 feet SW from his       original location.         (8.) This subadult male was first caught at the hilltop       outcrop on October 4, 1949. Two days later he had moved 160       feet north along the outcrop. A month later he had shifted       600 feet south; in three more days 1040 feet north. On       November 15 he was 105 feet south of the November 8       location; on November 16, he had moved 70 feet north. On       November 17 he had moved 900 feet back south, but had       returned on the 18th to the November 16 location. On       November 22, he had again shifted 900 feet south. All       capture sites were at the hilltop outcrop.         (9.) This male was caught as a juvenile (75 grams) on       October 8, 1950. On November 9 he had moved 220 feet, from       the lower outcrop to the upper, and he was recaptured at or       near this same site on November 10, 28 and 29, and on       January 11 and February 9, 1951. On November 21, 1951, grown       to maximum adult size, he was caught at a new location 1080       feet from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33574"],[0,"A Field Study of the Kansas Ant-Eating Frog, Gastrophryne olivacea (#5)"],[1,"may be typical after periods of drought  years have prevented successful reproduction. Summer drought in 1952 and  1953 prevented breeding in those years, or, at least, it drastically  reduced the numbers of young produced. One-year-old and two-year-old  frogs may not have been represented at all in the sample of 58.  Three-year-old frogs presumably made up a substantial part of the  sample, since 1951 was a year of successful breeding.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Growth in a group of frogs, each marked while  still short of adult size and mostly recaptured after lapse of one or  more hibernation periods. Each line connects records of an individual  frog.]    Differences in size between species and geographic variation in size in  _Gastrophryne_ have been given little attention by herpetologists, but  if understood, would help to clarify relationships. Hecht and Matalas  stated in their revision (1946: 5) that size is of no importance as a  taxonomic character, as typical _carolinensis_, _olivacea_, and  _mazatlanensis_ all averaged approximately the same--26 to 28  mm.--females slightly larger than males. However, they arbitrarily  classed as adults all individuals 22.5 mm. in length or larger, having  found individuals this small that showed the darkened and distensible  throat pouches characteristic of adult males. From the trend of my own  measurements of _G. olivacea_ in northeastern Kansas, I conclude that  either many immature individuals were included in their samples, or that  the populations sampled included some with individuals that were  remarkably small as adults.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Growth in another group of frogs that were marked  as young or small adults and recaptured after intervals of more than a  year. Frogs of this group were, on the average, larger than the  individuals shown in Fig. 6, and they made less rapid growth.]    The population which I studied may be considered typical of _G.  olivacea_. They averaged large, including individuals up to 42 mm. in  length, well above the maximum sizes for any reported in the literature.  At metamorphosis these _olivacea_ are of approximately 50 percent  greater length than _G. carolinensis_ as reported by Wright and Wright  (1949: 573) and Anderson (1954: 41). Yet Blair (1950: 152) observed that  in eastern Oklahoma, where the ranges of _olivacea_ and _carolinensis_  overlap, the latter is larger. On the basis of field and laboratory  observations he tentatively concluded that one of the main barriers to  interbreeding was the reluctance of the males of _carolinensis_ to clasp  the smaller females of _olivacea_.    That size differs in different populations, and is still poorly  understood, is illustrated by the following discrepant figures from  various authors.    TABLE 4.

At the time of  metamorphosis, young are dark brown with specks of black and with a  dark, cuneate, leaflike middorsal mark. The narrow end of this mark  arises just behind the head, and the mark extends posteriorly as far as  the hind leg insertions. At its widest, the mark covers about half the  width of the dorsal surface. The lateral edges of the mark are sharply  defined, but at its anterior and posterior ends it blends into the  ground color. In most individuals smaller than 20 mm., this dorsal mark  is well defined and conspicuous. As growth proceeds, however, it becomes  faint. In frogs 19 to 25 mm. long the marks have disappeared. In  individuals of this size the brown ground color is markedly paler than  in those newly metamorphosed, but is darker than in adults.    In large adults the dorsal coloration is a uniform pale tan, paler on  the average in females than in males. Temperature and moisture both  affect the shade of coloration. In frogs that were partly desiccated,  the color was unusually pale, with a distinctly greenish tint, and at  high temperatures coloration tended to be relatively pale.    Hecht and Matalas (1946) have described and figured color patterns in  various populations of _Gastrophryne_, demonstrating geographic trends  and helping to clarify relationships. Their account indicates that the  dark dorsal mark present in young of _olivacea_ but not present in  adults, is better developed and longer persisting in other forms.  Specimens of _carolinensis_, presumably adult, are figured which have  the dark middorsal area contrasting with paler color of the sides. The  dark area is seen to consist of dots or blotches of black pigment which  may be in contact producing more or less continuous black areas, or may  be separate and distinct producing a spotted pattern. Pigmentation is  usually most intense along the lateral edges of the dorsal leaflike  mark; the central portion may be so much paler that the effect is that  of a pair of dorsolateral stripes. This latter type of pattern is best  developed in the population of Key West, Florida. Hecht and Matalas did  not consider these insular frogs to be taxonomically distinct, because  only 48 percent of specimens from the Florida keys had the \"Key West\"  pattern, while 29 per cent resembled _olivacea_ and 23 per cent  resembled _carolinensis_. In the southwestern subspecies (or species)  _mazatlanensis_, recorded from several localities in Sonora and from  extreme southern Arizona, the dorsal pigmentation similarly tends to be  concentrated in dorsolateral bands, but is much reduced or almost  absent, and there is corresponding pigmentation dorsally across the  middle of the thigh, across the middle of the shank, and on the foot.  When the leg is folded, these three dark areas are brought in contact  with each other and with the dorsolateral body mark, if it is present,  to form a continuous dark area, in a characteristic \"ruptive\" pattern.  Hecht and Matalas found similar leg bars, less well developed, in  certain specimens of _olivacea_ including one from Gage County,  Nebraska, at the northern end of the known geographic range.      MOVEMENTS    Freiburg (_op. cit._: 384) concluded that ant-eating frogs seem to have  no individual home ranges, but wander in any direction where suitable  habitat is present. However, from records covering a much longer span of  time, it became increasingly evident that a frog ordinarily tends to  stay within a small area, familiar to it and providing its habitat  requirements.    Nevertheless, in all but a few instances the marked frogs recaptured  were in new locations a greater or lesser distance from the site of  original capture. The movements made by these frogs were of several  distinct types:      1. Routine day to day movements from shelter to shelter within       the area familiar to the animal, the \"home range.\"      2. Shifts from one home range to another; such shifts may have       been either long or short, and may have occurred abruptly or       by gradual stages.      3. Travel by adults to or from a breeding pond. In most or all       instances these adults were regularly established in permanent       home ranges, and they often moved through areas unsuitable       as habitat to reach the ponds.      4. Movements of dispersal in the young, recently metamorphosed       and not yet settled in a regular home range.    Usually there was uncertainty as to which types of movements had been  made by the recaptured individuals. Some may have made two or three  different types of movements in the interval between captures.    On many occasions individuals were found beneath the same rock on two  consecutive days, or occasionally on several successive days. Rarely,  such continued occupancy of a niche lasted several weeks. In 1949, a  frog was found under the same rock on June 4, 6, 26, 27, and July 1, 3  and 11. This was an immature female, presumably metamorphosed late in  the summer of 1948. During the five weeks period covered by the records,  it grew from 27 mm. to 34 mm. In 1952, another individual was found  under its home rock on June 23 and 30, July 2 and 3, and August 14 and  20. In 1952 a juvenile was found under a rock on May 30, June 4, and  June 17. These "]]]
