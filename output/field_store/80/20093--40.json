Which is  the most common? If it flies or jumps, note the distance.    8. If you find the young, note whether they differ from the adult in  general appearance, and if so, in what ways they differ. Do they  differ in food?    9. What other insects do you find in the same habitat?      2. A STUDY OF GRASSHOPPERS (LOCUSTS)    _Insects adapted to Life in Grassy Meadows and Fields_          _Materials._    Both living and dead specimens of grasshoppers. Various stages of  young grasshoppers either dead or living. Some mounted specimens with  wings spread. The wings of grasshoppers mounted in pairs between two  glass slides for use with microscope or hand lens. Mounted  preparations of mouth parts and tracheae.          _Definitions._    _Orthoptera_, straight-winged insects, order to which belong  grasshoppers, locusts, katydids, crickets, cockroaches, etc.    _Vivarium_, a cage in which living animals are kept.    _Anterior_, toward the head of an animal.    _Posterior_, opposite to anterior.    _Dorsal_, the upper surface of an animal.    _Ventral_, opposite to dorsal.    _Regions_, principal divisions of the body of an animal.    _Head_, _thorax_, and _abdomen_, the three distinct regions into  which the body of a grasshopper is divided.    _Somite_, a ring-like division of the body of an animal.    _Prothorax_, _mesothorax_, and _metathorax_, the three divisions or  somites into which the thorax of any insect is divided. A pair of  legs is borne on each division.    _Exoskeleton_, an external skeleton.    _Femur_, _tibia_, and _tarsus_, the three principal divisions of the  leg corresponding to thigh, shank, and foot.    _Veins_, thread-like thickenings of the wings.    _Ocelli_, the single or simple eyes of an insect, composed of a  single eye element.    _Compound eyes_, made up of many eye elements.    _Auditory sacs_, organs for hearing in many animals.    _Antennae_, the feelers borne on the head.    _Labrum_, the upper lip.    _Labium_, the lower lip, formed by the growing together of the second  maxillae.    _Mandibles_, primary jaws situated under the labrum.    _Maxillae_, secondary jaws just in front of the labium, each composed  of three parts, a palp, a spoon, and a tooth.    _Palps_, the jointed finger-like structures used to handle food, one  pair on the labium and one pair on the maxillae.    _Spiracles_, openings into the trachea found along the sides of the  abdomen and thorax.    _Tracheae_, slender tubes used for breathing organs among insects.  They carry the air direct to the tissues in all parts of the body.    _Ovipositors_, structures on the posterior end of the abdomen of a  female, used to deposit eggs.    _Metamorphosis_, refers to the development of the young of animals  when striking changes in structure occur in the course of their  growth. Metamorphosis is called _complete_ when the young have no  resemblance to the adults, and _incomplete_ when there is a  resemblance to the adult. In complete metamorphosis the stages are  _larva_, _pupa_, and _adult_. In incomplete metamorphosis the stages  are _nymph_ and _adult_.          _Observations._    _The Body._    1. Show how the shape of the grasshopper's body is well adapted to  its needs.    2. Which region of the body is the thickest? What seems to be the  reason for this? Which regions are capable of movement?    _Locomotion._    3. What are the various kinds of locomotion a grasshopper can use?  Which are used in the vivarium and which when free in the laboratory?    4. Which legs are used in jumping? How are these legs especially  adapted to this, in length, structure and direction? Could a  grasshopper jump if the third pair of legs were arranged like the  other two pairs? Why?    5. How is the animal able to cling to grass stems and not slip down?  What is the direction of the body in relation to the stem or grass  blade?    6. What is the position of the wings when at rest? when in use? How  do the hind wings fold? How are the principal veins of the wings  arranged to permit or facilitate this folding?    7. Contrast the fore and hind wings with respect to thickness, size,  and use.    8.

How many compound eyes has the grasshopper? How many simple eyes?  Where are they located?      Examine a preparation of the compound eye with the low power or    as demonstrated with the stereopticon. What is the shape of an    eye element of the compound eye? About how many eye elements are    there in a compound eye?    _Feeding._    11. Do grasshoppers eat and drink while in captivity? Put a fresh  bunch of grass which has been sprinkled with water in a vivarium with  grasshoppers that have had no food or drink for twenty-four hours and  watch results.    12. What is the position of the grasshoppers in feeding? In what  direction do the jaws move in feeding? Compare this with the  direction of movement of your own jaws. What is the use of the palps?  What do you think is the use of the \"molasses\" or saliva that flows  from the mouth?    _Respiration._    13. Describe the breathing movements of a grasshopper and explain the  relation of the movements to inhalation and exhalation of air.    14. Find the exact location and number of spiracles on the abdomen.  There are two pairs of spiracles on the thorax. Find them. How do the  spiracles prevent the entrance of dust?      Describe a trachea as seen in a mounted preparation with the aid    of a microscope or stereopticon.    _Protection._    15. Explain how the colors of the grasshopper may be protective or  useful when at rest in its natural habitat and when in flight.    16. Does the shell cover the entire body? What are the advantages of  such a covering? A shell is likely to hinder activity, sensitiveness,  and growth. How are such disadvantages overcome in this case?    17. What senses are probably most relied upon to detect approaching  danger? Give evidence to support your answer.    18. What is the position of the hind legs when at rest? What relation  has this to safety?    _Reproduction and Development._    19. Describe the ovipositors and the probable method of their use.  Describe the egg packets of grasshoppers, if discovered. About how  many eggs in one? (They are sometimes seen against the glass sides of  the vivaria.)    20. If you have young grasshoppers of various ages, arrange a set of  them in what seems to you to be the order of their development. How  do young grasshoppers differ from adults?

On July 10, wolf No. 12  was found dead. Presumably he had died by July 6, for he had not moved  since then.    Wolf No. 13 had again split from his associates between June 14 and 19  and begun to travel alone. On July 20, his remains were discovered 24  miles (38.6 km) southeast of where the pack had settled. These deaths  will be discussed in detail later.      Movements of the Remaining Pack Member    After the death of her mate (No. 12), Wolf No. 11 left the  246-square-mile area in which the pack had settled (Fig. 19). By July  15, she had traveled 28 miles (45.0 km) northwest of this area and by  the 20th, was back by Otter Lake, 40 miles (64.4 km) north. She returned  south of Gibbs City on July 27, and was found about 3 miles (4.8 km)  north of the Wisconsin border on August 2, near Lac Vieux Desert about a  half mile (0.8 km) north of the Wisconsin border on August 6, and near  Bruce Crossing on August 9.    [Illustration: _Fig. 17.--Movements during the Post-release and  Directional Movement Phases of Wolves No. 11, 12, and 13_]    On August 13, Wolf No. 11 was located 1-1/2 miles (2.4 km) southeast of  Ewen on the western edge of her previous locations. She was not located  again until August 28. By then she had moved a straight-line distance of  almost 60 miles (96.5 km) to an area in Marquette County just south of  Squaw Lake, in the Witch Lake area. In doing so, she probably had passed  through the area previously explored just north of the Iron County  region where the pack had spent so much of its time. These widespread  movements are characteristic of lone wolves even in their native range  (Mech and Frenzel 1971).    No. 11 was still in the Witch Lake area on September 2. Due to poor  flying conditions we did not locate her again until September 19. At  that time she was on the Floodwood Plains a quarter mile (0.4 km) north  of the Floodwood Lakes. She was caught in a coyote trap during the night  of September 19 and shot about 10 a.m. on September 20.      Movements of Wolf No. 10    The movements of female wolf No. 10 during the post-release phase were  markedly different from those of the pack. In fact, this wolf apparently  skipped the relatively sedentary post-release phase of movements that  the pack displayed, and immediately dispersed (Fig. 20).    By the morning after release, No. 10 was 10 miles (16.0 km) southeast of  the release point and by late afternoon was an additional 5.5 miles (8.8  km) southeast (March 13). On the night of March 15 this wolf crossed  four-lane Highway 41, and on the 16th was found 1-1/4 miles (2.0 km)  south of the Marquette County Airport, approximately 32 miles (51.5 km)  from the release site; she had traveled a minimum of 36 miles (57.9 km)  to get there. However by March 20 she had returned to within 4 miles  (6.4 km) of the release point, and by the 24th was within a quarter mile  of the site.    The other three wolves had already dispersed westward and were near  Prickett Dam, some 40 miles (64.0 km) away. It is not known whether No.  10 tried to locate them. Her locations indicate that she did not,  although she may not have been able to find or follow their route. From  April 2 to 15, No. 10 made a second exploration southward, again  returning to the Huron Mountain area. She also made a third such trip on  June 14 to 22, even crossing Highway 41 again.    [Illustration: _Fig. 18.--Exploratory and Settled Phases in the  movements of Wolves No. 11, 12, and 13_]    [Illustration: _Fig. 19.--Movements of No. 11 after the death of No. 12  and 13_]    From the time of release until the first week in September, there seemed  to be a pattern to the movements of Wolf No. 10. She made nine trips of  about 40 miles (64.0 km) each, starting near Huron Mountain, extending  southeasterly about 20 miles (32.0 km), and then returning northwesterly  to the Huron Mountain area (Fig. 20).    [Illustration: _Fig. 20.--Movements of Wolf No. 10_]    During March, April, and the first week of May Wolf No. 10 made three of  these trips roughly paralleling the Lake Superior shore, and she  remained in the Huron Mountain area for several days between trips. From  late May until mid-July she made four such trips but did not remain long  anywhere. During that time she gradually moved westerly to near the  Dead River Basin. In late July she made another trip to the Dead River  Basin area after a stay near the Big Bay dump. These trips enlarged No.  10's range considerably.    Early in July, Wolf No. 10 moved almost directly south from the Huron  Mountain area to the Silver Lake area, again expanding her range to the  west. From September 5 until October 10 she remained in the Silver Lake  area, and there was no apparent pattern to her movements then. After the  wolf was located on September 15 near a bait that bear hunters had put  out on the west edge of the Mulligan Plains, a ground check was made. No  evidence of the wolf was found at the bear bait, consisting mostly of  fish, and no signal was heard there. A signal was picked up in the  southwest corner of the Mulligan Plains, and the wolf was flushed from  her bed about 80 yards (75 m) away.    On October 10, this wolf began a westward move, and on October 22 she  was found south of Herman, 25 miles (40.2 km) west of Silver Lake. On  October 24 she was located 6.5 miles (10.4 km) to the northeast, near  Dirkman Lake. By October 26 she had moved 12 miles (19.3 km) southeast  to within a mile of the town of Michigamme. From there she gradually  moved northeastward. She was shot near Van Riper Lake during deer  hunting season, probably on the morning of November 16.    During the westward move, this wolf had increased the size of her range  by 87 square miles (222.7 km^2), about a 30% increase. She seemed to be  heading back to the Silver Lake area when she was killed.                                   Feeding Habits    What little information we could obtain on the wolves' feeding habits  indicated considerable variation (Table 4).    In the Skanee area, which the pack of three first visited after leaving  the release area, deer were abundant, and 7 to 10 were seen within a  quarter mile (0.4 km) of the pack on March 20. It is possible that the  wolves killed a deer there, for they remained in the area for a few  days. They did scavenge deer feet and head remains on the 22nd at Laws  Lake, 12 miles (19.3 km) southwest of Skanee. Deer were also sighted  within a quarter mile of the wolves on March 25, April 15, April 16, May  7, June 8, and June 14.    The first confirmed deer kill was made east of Otter Lake about April 1.  The deer was a 4-1/2-year-old doe with a partly healed broken left front  leg (radius) and fat-depleted bone marrow (1%); a bullet was found in  the skin of the right front leg.    The pack also fed on a discarded deer carcass near Nisula, and then  killed a 5-1/2-year-old doe near Kenton on April 15 (Fig. 21); this  animal also had bone marrow with a low fat content (6%).    The next day, lone Wolf No. 10, back in the Huron Mountain area, killed  a 4-5-year-old doe with fat-depleted marrow (5.6%).    No doubt not all of the deer killed or fed upon by the translocated  wolves were found, even when snow was present. However, it is clear from  the observations we did make, and from the fact that all 26 scats we  analyzed from this pack contained deer hair, that the wolves did adapt  to killing deer in their new environment and that it was their primary  food.    Near Atlantic Mine the wolves scavenged on garbage from loggers, and  then near Otter Lake they spent several days also feeding on garbage. A  discarded cow (_Bos taurus_) head was scavenged, and at least one  red-backed vole (_Clethrionomys gapperi_) was consumed. Lone Wolf No. 10  was found near the Big Bay dump nine times, or 29% of the times she was  located during tourist season (May through August).    _Table 4.
