Alack the day, when the  sweets of the sprouting corn tempt him to turn rogue, for then he  becomes a banned outlaw, and the sudden thunder of the gun announces  his tragic fate. He keeps well the secret of constructing his cunning  house, without a show of heaped or scattered soil at its entrance.  Bearing himself honestly, and escaping his enemies, the cat, the hawk,  and the boy, he lives a long day of happy inoffensive life. Then when  the filmy curtain of the Indian summer falls upon the year again, he  bids us a long good-night.          IX    SPRING SHOOTING      The Ram makes way for the Bull; March goes out and April comes in with  sunshine and showers, smiles and tears. The sportsman has his gun in  hand again with deadly purpose, as the angler his rod and tackle with  another intention than mere overhauling and putting to rights. The  smiles of April are for them.    The geese come wedging their way northward; the ducks awaken the silent  marshes with the whistle of their pinions; the snipe come in pairs and  wisps to the thawing bogs--all on their way to breeding grounds and  summer homes. The tears of April are for them. Wherever they stop for a  day's or an hour's rest, and a little food to strengthen and hearten  them for their long journey, the deadly, frightful gun awaits to kill,  maim, or terrify, more merciless than all the ills that nature inflicts  in her unkindest moods.    Year after year men go on making laws and crying for more, to protect  these fowl in summer, but in spring, when as much as ever they need  protection, the hand of man is ruthlessly against them.    When you made that splendid shot last night in the latest gloaming that  would show you the sight of your gun, and cut down that ancient goose,  tougher than the leather of your gun-case, and almost as edible, of how  many well-grown young geese of next November did you cheat yourself, or  some one else of the brotherhood?    When from the puddle, where they were bathing their tired wings, sipping  the nectar of muddy water, and nibbling the budding leaves of water  weeds, you started that pair of ducks yesterday, and were so proud of  tumbling them down right and left, you killed many more than you saw  then; many that you might have seen next fall.    When the sun was shining down so warm upon the steaming earth that the  robins and bluebirds sang May songs, those were very good shots you  made, killing ten snipe straight and clean, and--they were very bad  shots. For in November the ten might have been four times ten fat and  lusty, lazy fellows, boring the oozy margins of these same pools where  the frogs are croaking and the toads are singing to-day.    \"Well, it's a long time to wait from November till the earth ripens and  browns to autumn again. Life is short and shooting days are few at most.  Let us shoot our goose while we may, though she would lay a golden egg  by and by.\"    Farmers do not kill their breeding ewes in March, nor butcher cows that  are to calve in a month; it does not pay. Why should sportsmen be less  provident of the stock they prize so dearly; stock that has so few  care-takers, so many enemies? Certainly, it does not pay in the long  run.          X    THE GARTER-SNAKE      When the returned crows have become such familiar objects in the forlorn  unclad landscape of early spring that they have worn out their first  welcome, and the earliest songbirds have come to stay in spite of  inhospitable weather that seems for days to set the calendar back a  month, the woods invite you more than the fields. There nature is least  under man's restraint and gives the first signs of her reawakening. In  windless nooks the sun shines warmest between the meshes of the slowly  drifting net of shadows.    There are patches of moss on gray rocks and tree trunks. Fairy islands  of it, that will not be greener when they are wet with summer showers,  arise among the brown expanse of dead leaves. The gray mist of branches  and undergrowth is enlivened with a tinge of purple. Here and there the  tawny mat beneath is uplifted by the struggling plant life below it or  pierced through by an underthrust of a sprouting seed. There is a  promise of bloom in blushing arbutus buds, a promise even now fulfilled  by the first squirrelcups just out of their furry bracts and already  calling the bees abroad. Flies are buzzing to and fro in busy idleness,  and a cricket stirs the leaves with a sudden spasm of movement. The  first of the seventeen butterflies that shall give boys the freedom of  bare feet goes wavering past like a drifting blossom.    A cradle knoll invites you to a seat on the soft, warm cushion of dead  leaves and living moss and purple sprigs of wintergreen with their blobs  of scarlet berries, which have grown redder and plumper under every snow  of the winter. This smoothly rounded mound and the hollow scooped beside  it, brimful now of amber, sun-warmed water, mark the ancient place of a  great tree that was dead and buried, and all traces by which its kind  could be identified were mouldered away and obliterated, before you were  born.    The incessant crackling purr of the wood-frogs is interrupted at your  approach, and they disappear till the wrinkled surface of the oblong  pool grows smooth again and you perceive them sprawled along the bottom  on the leaf paving of their own color. As you cast a casual glance on  your prospective seat, carelessly noting the mingling of many hues, the  brightness of the berries seems most conspicuous, till a moving curved  and recurved gleam of gold on black and a flickering flash of red catch  your eye and startle you with an involuntary revulsion.    With charmed eyes held by this new object, you grope blindly for a stick  or stone. But, if you find either, forbear to strike. Do not blot out  one token of spring's awakening nor destroy one life that rejoices in  it, even though it be so humble a life as that of a poor garter-snake.  He is so harmless to man, that, were it not for the old, unreasoning  antipathy, our hands would not be raised against him; and, if he were  not a snake, we should call him beautiful in his stripes of black and  gold, and in graceful motion--a motion that charms us in the undulation  of waves, in their flickering reflections of sunlight on rushy margins  and wooded shores, in the winding of a brook through a meadow, in the  flutter of a pennant and the flaunting of a banner, the ripple of  wind-swept meadow and grain field, and the sway of leafy boughs. His  colors are fresh and bright as ever you will see them, though he has but  to-day awakened from a long sleep in continual darkness.    He is simply enjoying the free air and warm sunshine without a thought  of food for all his months of fasting. Perhaps he has forgotten that  miserable necessity of existence. When at last he remembers that he has  an appetite, you can scarcely imagine that he can have any pleasure in  satisfying it with one huge mouthful of twice or thrice the ordinary  diameter of his gullet. If you chance to witness his slow and painful  gorging of a frog, you hear a cry of distress that might be uttered with  equal cause by victim or devourer. When he has fully entered upon the  business of reawakened life, many a young field-mouse and noxious  insect will go into his maw to his own and your benefit. If there go  also some eggs and callow young of ground-nesting birds, why should you  question his right, you, who defer slaughter out of pure selfishness,  that a little later you may make havoc among the broods of woodcock and  grouse?    Of all living things, only man disturbs the nicely adjusted balance of  nature. The more civilized he becomes the more mischievous he is. The  better he calls himself, the worse he is. For uncounted centuries the  bison and the Indian shared a continent, but in two hundred years or so  the white man has destroyed the one and spoiled the other.    Surely there is little harm in this lowly bearer of a name honored in  knighthood, and the motto of the noble order might be the legend written  on his gilded mail, \"Evil to him who evil thinks.\" If this sunny patch  of earth is not wide enough for you to share with him, leave it to him  and choose another for yourself. The world is wide enough for both to  enjoy this season of its promise.          XI    THE TOAD      During our summer acquaintance with her, when we see her oftenest, a  valued inhabitant of our garden and a welcome twilight visitor at our  threshold, we associate silence with the toad, almost as intimately as  with the proverbially silent clam. In the drouthy or too moist summer  days and evenings, she never awakens our hopes or fears with shrill  prophecies of rain as does her nimbler and more aspiring cousin, the  tree-toad.    A rustle of the cucumber leaves that embower her cool retreat, the spat  and shuffle of her short, awkward leaps, are the only sounds that then  betoken her presence, and we listen in vain for even a smack of pleasure  or audible expression of self-approval, when, after a nervous,  gratulatory wriggle of her hinder toes, she dips forward and, with a  lightning-like out-flashing of her unerring tongue, she flicks into her  jaws a fly or bug. She only winks contentedly to express complete  satisfaction at her performance and its result.    Though summer's torrid heat cannot warm her to any voice, springtime and  love make her tuneful, and every one hears the softly trilled,  monotonous song jarring the mild air, but few know who is the singer.  The drumming grouse is not shyer of exhibiting his performance.    From a sun-warmed pool not fifty yards away a full chorus of the rapidly  vibrant voices arises, and you imagine that the performers are so  absorbed with their music that you may easily draw near and observe  them. But when you come to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#5)"],[1,"no favouring strength; the Boers outnumbered us  everywhere, and not only did they exceed us numerically, but their  mobility enabled them so quickly to move from front to flank positions  that they were, on desire, facing us at any moment. In fact the Boer  army had no flank, and therefore the vast amount of after-the-event  wisdom which was gratuitously handed about by \"the man in the street\"  was absolutely wasted.    An unfortunate incident now occurred. Capt. James Rutherford and Mr.  Grenfell, S.A.L.H., while visiting the pickets, disappeared. They  apparently rode into the midst of the enemy's scouts, who were  everywhere prowling about, and were forced to surrender. The report of  the capture was brought to the camp by native runners, who stated that  the officers had been removed to Pretoria. However, for two gallant  Britons lost there was one gained, for at the very time Mr. Winston  Churchill had almost miraculously made himself free of his captors.    The story of his escape reads like a novel; but truth is stranger than  fiction. When removed to Pretoria after the disaster to the armoured  train at Chieveley, he almost gave up hope of escape; indeed he had every  reason so to do, for on the 12th of December he was informed by the  Transvaal Government's Secretary for War that there was little chance of  his release. Whereupon, with many doubts and misgivings, he discussed  with himself the best means of struggling for freedom. The State Schools  Prison was well guarded; it was surrounded by a high wall, and the  sentries were vigilant in the extreme. He formed for himself a plan,  however, and once when the back of the sentry was momentarily turned he  took his courage in both hands as the French say, rushed at the six-foot  wall, scaled it, and let himself down into a neighbouring garden before  his movement could be detected. The garden was the garden of an inhabited  house. There were lights in the windows; more, there were visitors on the  verandah, and presently, ramblers among the paths! Moments of horror as  the escaped hid in the trees seemed to become years, discovery appeared  to be merely a matter of moments. But evidently the Fates decided that so  useful a member of creation--warrior, writer, and politician--could not  be spared by society or his country, and in a little while Mr. Churchill  found himself wandering, undisguised and unrecognised, through the  streets of the town. Burghers passed him, passengers brushed his  shoulders. Nobody asked his business. It was evident that Fate wanted  him. The stars said so, and following their direction he struck out  towards the Delagoa Railroad. He knew that he dared ask his way of none;  he was aware that he must make the most of the cloak of night; he was  intimate enough with Boer customs to be certain that in a few hours his  description would be posted throughout the two Republics. The present,  and only the present, was his. He walked along the line, evading the  watchers on bridges and culverts, and determining to stick to the rails,  without which he might find himself lost or wandering back in the teeth  of the enemy. Once free of the town, he bided his time cautiously in the  neighbourhood of an adjacent station. There he watched the coming of a  train, and just as it steamed past him, with an alacrity and agility born  of sheer despair, he made a leap towards a truck, grabbed at a hook on  the edge, boarded it, and was soon burrowing deep in a cargo of  coal-sacks. There he lay, grimy, exhausted, and almost distraught, but  happy. He was free. Every minute the anxiety for freedom had grown within  him, till now, fighting his way towards it, it had become an almost  savage passion. He had decided he would never go back. No one should  capture him. But this was easier to swear than to accomplish. To escape  detection it was necessary again to risk his life--to leap off the train  as he had leapt on it, while the machinery was in full swing and the  driver ignorant of the existence of his distinguished passenger. Before  dawn, therefore, he emerged from the coal-heap, and with a flying leap  landed flat on the railroad. He gathered himself together, and by sunrise  was concealed in a wood, his only companion for some time being a  vulture. The sojourn in the cool boskage of the Transvaal was fraught  with good luck, and at dusk when the fugitive emerged he was another man.  At last he was able to gather his forces together for another trip on a  passing train. There was always danger though--danger because it was  necessary to hug the line, and where the line was, there also were  railway guards, or at least humanity--inimical humanity, who most  probably were plotting his ruin. Plod, plod, plod; so passed the hours,  scrambling along in the dead of night through sluits and dongas in the  effort to avoid the direct neighbourhood of huts, bridges, stations, and  yet keep in touch with the winding iron track that led to the longed-for  sea. For five days and nights he persevered, tramping after dark and  sneaking under cover all day, and dimly conscious that the hue and cry  had gone forth, and that every man's hand in the enemy's country was now  turned against him. On the sixth day he managed again with amazing good  fortune to safely board a train, and this time it was one going from  Middleburg to Delagoa Bay. Again he burrowed among sacks and carefully  hid himself, so carefully, indeed, that owing to his extreme precaution  discovery was evaded. The train was searched, the sacks were prodded.  Deep down, scarcely daring to breathe, lay the man they were seeking--an  inch or two off--just an inch or two off. He drew a long breath and  praised God for his escape. After that he passed some sixty hours in all  the agonies of suspense. Famine and thirst preyed on him, and active  horror lest all his exertions should be in vain, lest, at the very last  moment, the whole struggle of hope and wretchedness would end in dire and  fatal disaster. But he was preserved. He arrived at Lourenco Marques on  the 21st of December, and from there proceeded to Natal. \"I am very  weak, but I am free.\" Such were the words of his telegram; no wired  words ever meant more. \"I have lost many pounds in weight, but I am  lighter in heart; and I avail myself of this moment, which is a witness  to my earnestness, to urge an unflinching and uncompromising prosecution  of the war.\" In regard to Mr. Winston Churchill's arrival among his  friends in Natal, an eye-witness wrote:--         \"The 23rd of December last was a memorable day at Durban,       perhaps the most memorable since that on which the Boers'       ultimatum was published. From Lourenco Marques had come the       exciting intelligence that young Winston Churchill, a       distinguished member of a world-renowned race, had succeeded in       evading his jailers at Pretoria, and, after a series of       thrilling adventures, had arrived safely at Delagoa Bay. The       telegrams had further announced that the hero had immediately       shipped on board the Rennie liner _Induna_ and would land at       Durban that very afternoon. The fame of Mr. Churchill as a       soldier and an author was already established. The history of       his gallantry both in India and at Omdurman was already well       known to every good Natalian before he first stepped ashore       there as one of the war correspondents of the _Morning Post_.       His subsequent courageous conduct at Chieveley at the       unfortunate incident of the armoured train and his capture by       the Boers, now capped by his marvellous escape from Pretoria,       had set Durban agog with excitement, and filled all and sundry       with hearty desires to afford him a right royal welcome on his       landing again on British soil.         \"The brilliant summer sunshine, tempered by a fresh sea-breeze       which sent a soft ripple across the deep blue surface of the       magnificent harbour; the bold headland of the bluff contrasting       vividly against the streets of iron-roofed dwellings in the       township; the large numbers of ocean-going steamers and sailing       craft, gay with bunting; the eager, expectant crowd of every       class of society, from gaily-dressed ladies to wharf labourers,       refugees, and Kaffirs in but shirts and trousers, all       contributed to the completion of a picturesque panorama never       to be forgotten. Long before midday did we assemble in our       thousands. When it was whispered about that the _Induna_ would       berth alongside the steamer _Inchanga_, and that Mr. Churchill       must cross the decks of the _Inchanga_ before stepping ashore,       a rush was made for her, and, in spite of all the efforts of       the officers and crew, the crowd swarmed like bees on her. They       took possession of every available point of vantage; they       invaded the sacred precincts of the captain's bridge; they       braved the perils of the rigging; they huddled together on the       'fo'cas'le'; they filled every boat; and, heedless of fresh       paint, they clung affectionately to the ventilators and the       funnel.         \"After having been several times reported the _Induna_ rounded       the point at half-past two. Amid breathless expectation she       steamed slowly across the harbour. Standing beside the captain       on the bridge a smallish, clean-shaven man was descried, and       the crowd at once recognised him as the hero whom they had       assembled to honour. A thousand good British cheers broke the       silence, a thousand lusty throats shouted a heartfelt welcome.       But this was not all. The sturdy Natalians did not stop at       shouting. The moment the _Induna_ was moored Mr. Churchill,       smiling, was seized bodily by twenty pairs of brawny arms, was       patted and thumped on the back by hundreds of applauding hands,       and finally, after being nearly"]]]
