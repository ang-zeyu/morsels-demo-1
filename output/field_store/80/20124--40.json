This again was used by my  enemies to blacken my character. In reality, I had tried to keep the  ungracious Polar controversy within the bounds of decent, gentlemanly  conduct; but indecency had become the keynote, and against this, mild  methods served no good purpose. I preferred, therefore, to go away and  allow the atmosphere to clear of the stench stirred up by rival  interest; but while I was away, my enemies were watched, and I am here  now to uncover the darkest campaign of bribery and conspiracy ever  forged in a strife for honor.    Now that my disappointment, my bitterness has passed, that my hurt has  partly healed, I have determined to tell the whole truth about myself,  about the charges made against me, and about those by whom the charges  were made. Herein, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I will tell how and why I  believed I reached the North Pole, and give fully the record upon which  this claim is based. Only upon such a complete account of day-by-day  traveling and such observations, can any claim rest.    Despite the hullabaloo of voluminous so-called proofs offered by a  rival, I am certain that the unprejudiced reader will herein find as  complete a story, and as valuable figures as those ever offered by  anyone for any such achievement in exploration as mine. Herein, for the  first time, shall I answer _in toto_ all charges made against me, and  this because the entire truth concerning these same charges I have not  succeeded in giving the world through other channels. Because of the  power of those who arrayed themselves against me, I found the columns of  the press closed to much that I wished to say; articles which I wrote  for publication underwent editorial excision, and absolutely necessary  explanations, which in themselves attacked my assailants, were  eliminated.    Only by reading my own story, as fully set down herein, can anyone judge  of the relative value of my claim and that of my rival claimant; only by  so doing can anyone get at the truth of the plot made to discredit me;  only by doing so can one learn the reason for all of my actions, for my  failure to meet charges at the time they were made, for my disappearing  at a time when such action was unfairly made to confirm the worst  charges of my detractors. That I have been too charitable with those who  attempted to steal the justly deserved honors of my achievement, I am  now convinced; when desirable, I shall now, having felt the smarting  sting of the world's whip, and in order to justify myself, use the  knife. I shall tell the truth even though it hurts. I have not been  spared, and I shall spare no one in telling the unadorned and unpleasant  story of a man who has been bitterly wronged, whose character has been  assailed by bought and perjured affidavits, whose life before he  returned from the famine-land of ice and cold--the world of his  conquest--was endangered, designedly or not, by a dishonest  appropriation of food supplies by one who afterwards endeavored  to steal from him his honor, which is more dear than life.    To be doubted, and to have one's honesty assailed, has been the  experience of many explorers throughout history. The discoverer of our  own continent, Christopher Columbus, was thrown into prison, and  another, Amerigo Vespucci, was given the honor, his name to this day  marking the land which was reached only through the intrepidity and  single-hearted, single-sustained confidence of a man whose vision his  own people doubted. Even in my own time have explorers been assailed,  among them Stanley, whose name for a time was shrouded with suspicion,  and others who since have joined the ranks of my assailants.  Unfortunately, in such cases the matter of proof and the reliability of  any claim, basicly, must rest entirely upon the intangible evidence of a  man's own word; there can be no such thing as a palpable and indubitable  proof. And in the case when a man's good faith is aspersed and his  character assailed, the world's decision must rest either upon his own  word or that of his detractors.    Returning from the North, exhausted both in body and brain by a savage  and excruciating struggle against famine and cold, yet thrilling with  the glorious conviction of a personal attainment, I was tossed to the  zenith of worldly honor on a wave of enthusiasm, a world-madness, which  startled and bewildered me. In that swift, sudden, lightning-flash  ascension to glory, which I had not expected, and in which I was as a  bit of helpless drift in the thundering tossing of an ocean storm, I was  decorated with unasked-for honors, the laudations of the press of the  world rang in my ears, the most notable of living men hailed me as one  great among them. I found myself the unwilling and uncomfortable guest  of princes, and I was led forward to receive the gracious hand of a  King.    Returning to my own country, still marveling that such honors should be  given because I had accomplished what seemed, and still seems, a merely  personal achievement, and of little importance to anyone save to him who  throbs with the gratification of a personal success, I was greeted with  mad cheers and hooting whistles, with bursting guns and blaring bands. I  was led through streets filled with applauding men and singing children  and arched with triumphal flowers. In a dizzy whirl about the  country--which now seems like a delirious dream--I experienced what I am  told was an ovation unparalleled of its kind.    Coincident with my return to civilization, and while the world was  ringing with congratulations, there came stinging through the cold air  from the North, by wireless electric flashes, word from Mr. Peary that  he had reached the North Pole and that, in asserting such a claim  myself, I was a liar. I did not then doubt the good faith of Peary's  claim; having reached the boreal center myself, under extremely  favorable weather conditions, I felt that he, with everything in his  favor, could do as much a year later, as he claimed. I replied with all  candor what I felt, that there was glory enough for two. But I did, of  course, feel the sting of my rival's unwarranted and virulent attacks.  In the stress of any great crisis, the average human mind is apt to be  carried away by unwise impulses.    Following Mr. Peary's return, I found myself the object of a campaign to  discredit me in which, I believe, as an explorer, I stand the most  shamefully abused man in the history of exploration. Deliberately  planned, inspired at first, and at first directed, by Mr. Peary from  the wireless stations of Labrador, this campaign was consistently and  persistently worked out by a powerful and affluent organization, with  unlimited money at its command, which has had as its allies dishonest  pseudo-scientists, financially and otherwise interested in the success  of Mr. Peary's expedition. With a chain of powerful newspapers, a  financial backer of Peary led a campaign to destroy confidence in me. I  found myself in due time, before I realized the importance of underhand  attacks, in a quandary which baffled and bewildered me. Without any  organization behind me, without any wires to pull, without, at the time,  any appreciable amount of money for defence, I felt what anyone who is  not superhuman would have felt, a sickening sense of helplessness, a  disgust at the human duplicity which permitted such things, a sense of  the futility of the very thing I had done and its little worth compared  to the web of shame my enemies were endeavoring to weave about me.    One of the remarkable things about modern journalism is that, by  persistent repetition, it can create as a fact in the public mind a  thing which is purely immaterial or untrue. Taking the cue from Peary,  there was at the beginning a widespread and unprecedented call for  \"proofs,\" which in some vague way were to consist of unreduced  reckonings. Mr. Peary had his own--he had buried part of mine. I did not  at the time instantly produce these vague and obscure proofs, knowing,  as all scientists know, that figures must inevitably be inadequate and  that any convincing proof that can exist is to be found only in the  narrative account of such a quest. I did not appreciate that in the  public mind, because of the newspapers' criticisms, there was growing a  demand for this vague something. For this reason, I did not consider an  explanation of the absurdity of this exaggerated position necessary.    Nor did I appreciate the relative effect of the National Geographic  Society's \"acceptance\" of Mr. Peary's so-called \"proofs\" while mine were  not forthcoming. I did not know at the time, what has since been brought  out in the testimony given before the Naval Committee in Washington,  that the National Geographic Society's verdict was based upon an  indifferent examination of worthless observations and a few seconds'  casual observation of Mr. Peary's instruments by several members of the  Society in the Pennsylvania Railroad Station at Washington. With many  lecture engagements, I considered that I was right in doing what every  other explorer, including Mr. Peary himself, had done before me; that  is, to fulfill my lecture and immediate literary opportunities while  there was a great public interest aroused, and to offer a narrative of  greater length, with field observations and extensive scientific data,  later.    Following the exaggerated call for proofs, there began a series of  persistently planned attacks. So petty and insignificant did many of  them seem to me that I gave them little thought. My speed limits were  questioned, this charge being dropped when it was found that Mr. Peary's  had exceeded mine.

One of these, perhaps, would be in turnips, another among  stubble, and the third on grass. According to the nature of the crop,  the lay of the land, wind, &c., so we varied our tactics. Netting  partridges always requires two persons, though a third to walk after the  net is helpful. If the birds have been carefully marked down, a narrow  net is used; if their roosting-place is uncertain a wider net is better.  When all is ready this is slowly dragged along the ground, and is thrown  down immediately the whirr of wings is heard. If neatly and silently  done, the whole covey is bagged. There is a terrible flutter, a cloud of  brown feathers, and all is over. It is not always, however, that the  draw is so successful. In view of preventing this method of poaching,  especially on land where many partridges roost, keepers plant low  scrubby thorns at intervals. These so far interfere with the working of  the net as to allow the birds time to escape. We were never much  troubled, however, in this way. As opportunity offered the quick-thorns  were torn up, and a dead black-thorn bough took their place. As the  thorns were low the difference was never noticed, even by the keepers,  and, of course, they were carefully removed before, and replaced after,  netting. Even when the dodge was detected the fields and fallows had  been pretty much stripped of the birds. This method is impracticable  now, as the modern method of reaping leaves the brittle stubble as bare  as the squire's lawn. We had always a great objection to use a wide net  where a narrow one would suit the purpose. Among turnips, and where  large numbers of birds were supposed to lie, a number of rows or \"riggs\"  were taken at a time, until the whole of the ground had been traversed.  This last method is one that requires time and a knowledge of the  keeper's beat. On rough ground the catching of the net may be obviated  by having about eighteen inches of smooth glazed material bordering the  lowest and trailing part of it. Some of the small farmers were as fond  of poaching as ourselves, and here is a trick which one of them  successfully employed whenever he heard the birds in his land. He  scattered a train of grain from the field in which the partridge  roosted, each morning bringing it nearer and nearer to the stack-yard.  After a time the birds became accustomed to this mode of feeding, and as  they grew bolder the grain-train was continued inside the barn. When  they saw the golden feast invitingly spread, they were not slow to  enter, and the doors were quickly closed upon them. Then the farmer  entered with a bright light and felled the birds with a stick.    In the dusk of a late autumn afternoon a splendid \"pot\" shot was  sometimes had at a bunch of partridges just gathered for the night. I  remember a score such. The call of the partridge is less deceptive than  any other game bird, and the movements of a covey are easily watched.  This tracking is greatly aided if the field in which the birds are is  bounded by stone walls. As dusk deepens and draws to dark, they run and  call less, and soon all is still. The closely-packed covey is easy to  detect against the yellow stubble, and resting the gun on the wall, a  charge of heavy shot fired into their midst usually picks off the lot.  If in five minutes the shot brings up the keeper it matters little, as  then you are far over the land.    Partridges feed in the early morning--as soon as day breaks, in fact.  They resort to one spot, and are constant in their coming, especially if  encouraged. This fact I well knew, and laid my plans accordingly. By the  aid of the moon a train of grain was laid straight as a hazel wand. Upon  these occasions I never went abroad without an old duck-gun, the barrels  of which had been filed down. This enabled me to carry the gun-stock in  one pocket, the barrels in the other. The shortness of the latter in  nowise told against the shooting, as the gun was only required to use at  short distances. The weapon was old, thick at the muzzle, and into it I  crammed a heavy charge of powder and shot. Ensconced in the scrub I had  only now to wait for the dawn. Almost before it was fully light the  covey would come with a loud whirring of wings, and settle to feed  immediately. This was the critical moment. Firing along the line a  single shot strewed the ground with dead and dying; and in ten minutes,  always keeping clear of the roads, I was a mile from the spot.    I had yet another and a more successful method of taking partridges.  When, from the watchfulness or cleverness of keepers (they are not  intelligent men as a rule), both netting and shooting proved  impracticable, I soaked grain until it became swollen, and then steeped  it in the strongest spirit. This, as before, was strewn in the morning  paths of the partridge, and, soon taking effect, the naturally  pugnacious birds were presently staggering and fighting desperately.  Then I bided my time, and as opportunity offered, knocked the  incapacitated birds on the head.    [Illustration]    One of the most ingenious and frequently successful methods I employed  for bagging partridge was by the aid of an old setter bitch having a  lantern tied to her neck. Being somewhat risky, I only employed it when  other plans failed, and when I had a good notion of the keeper's  whereabouts. The lantern was made from an old salmon canister stripped  of its sides, and contained a bit of candle. When the bitch was put off  into seeds or stubble she would range quietly until she found the birds,  then stand as stiffly as though done in marble. This shewed me just  where the covey lay, and as the light either dazzled or frightened the  birds, it was not difficult to clap the net over them. It sometimes  happened that others besides myself were watching this strange luminous  light, and it was probably set down as some phenomenon of the night-side  of nature. Once, however, I lost my long silk net, and as there was  everything to be gained by running, and much to be lost by staying, I  ran desperately. Only an old, slow dog can be used in this species of  poaching, and it is marvellous to see with what spirit and seeming  understanding it enters into the work.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    Chapter 5.    HARE POACHING.        The merry brown hares came leaping        Over the crest of the hill,      Where the clover and corn lay sleeping        Under the moonlight still.      Our hare season generally began with partridge poaching, so that the  coming of the hunter's moon was always an interesting autumnal event. By  its aid the first big bag of the season was made. When a field is sown  down, which it is intended to bring back to grass, clover is invariably  sown with the grain. This springs between the corn stalks, and by the  time the golden sheaves are carried, has swathed the stubble with  mantling green. This, before all others, is the crop which hares love.    Poaching is one of the fine arts, and the man who would succeed must be  a specialist. If he has sufficient strength to refrain from general  \"mouching,\" he will succeed best by selecting one particular kind of  game, and directing his whole knowledge of woodcraft against it. In  spring and summer I was wont to closely scan the fields, and as  embrowned September drew near, knew the whereabouts of every hare in the  parish--not only the field where it lay, but the very clump of rushes in  which was its form. As puss went away from the gorse, or raced down the  turnip-rigg, I took in every twist and double down to the minutest  detail.    Then I scanned the \"smoots\" and gates through which she passed, and was  always careful to approach these laterally. I left no trace of hand nor  print of foot, nor disturbed the rough herbage. Late afternoon brought  me home, and upon the hearth the wires and nets were spread for  inspection. When all was ready, and the dogs whined impatiently to be  gone, I would strike right into the heart of the land, and away from the  high-road.    Mention of the dogs brings me to my fastest friends. Without them  poaching for fur would be almost impossible. I invariably used bitches,  and as success depended almost wholly upon them, I was bound to keep  only the best. Lurchers take long to train, but when perfected are  invaluable. I have had, maybe, a dozen dogs in all, the best being the  result of a pure cross between greyhound and sheepdog. In night work  silence is essential to success, and such dogs never bark; they have the  good nose of the one, and the speed of the other. In selecting puppies  it is best to choose rough-coated ones, as they are better able to stand  the exposure of cold, rough nights. Shades of brown and fawn are  preferable for colour, as these best assimilate to the duns and browns  of the fields and woods. The process of training would take long to  describe; but it is wonderful how soon the dog takes on the habits of  its master. They soon learn to slink along by hedge and ditch, and but  rarely shew in the open. They know every field-cut and by-path for  miles, and are as much aware as their masters that county constables  have a nasty habit of loitering about unfrequented lanes at daybreak.    [Illustration]    The difficulty lies not so much in obtaining game as in getting it home  safely; but for all that I was but rarely surprised with game upon me in  this way. Disused buildings, stacks, and dry ditches are made to contain  the \"haul\" until it can be sent for--an office which I usually got some  of the field-women to perform for me. Failing these, country carriers  and early morning milk-carts were useful. When I was night poaching, it  was important that I should have the earliest intimation of the approach  of a possible enemy, and to secure this the dogs were always trained to  run on a few hundred yards in advance.
