[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#5)"],[1,"      know that in the decomposition of albuminoids sulphureted hydrogen      is liberated which of itself discolors silver, brass, and onions.    I have deemed it advisable to publish this as one of the best means of  answering those correspondents who have made inquiries as to the  reliability of this test.    It is by some supposed that high colors and viscidity are indications of  non-edible species, but there are numerous exceptions here. _Russula  alutacea_--the pileus of which is often a purplish red--_Amanita  Caesarea_, and other species of brilliant coloring are known to be  edible. As to viscidity, two very viscid species, when young, are among  the highly prized esculents by those who know them, viz., _Fistulina  hepatica_, or the ox tongue, and _Hygrophorus eburneus_, the ivory  mushroom.    The method of deciding the character of mushrooms by their odor and  flavor is not to be relied upon. Edible mushrooms are usually  characterized by a pleasant flavor and odor; non-edible varieties have  sometimes an unpleasant odor, and produce a biting, burning sensation on  the tongue and throat, even in very small quantities, but several of the  _Amanitas_ have only a slight odor and taste, and certain species of  mushrooms, acrid otherwise, become edible when cooked.    In fact there is no general rule by which the edible species can be  distinguished from the unwholesome or poisonous ones. The safest as well  as the most sensible plan, therefore, is to apply the same rule as that  which we adopt in the case of the esculents among the flowering plants,  viz., to learn to know the characteristics of each individual species so  as to distinguish it from all others.    With regard to the mushrooms which have been designated as poisonous, it  should be remembered that the term \"poisonous\" is used relatively. While  some are only slightly poisonous, producing severe gastric irritation  and nervous derangement, but without fatal results, others, if eaten in  even very small quantity, may cause death. Happily, however, the most  dangerous species are not numerous as compared with the number that are  edible, and with careful attention on the part of the collector they may  be avoided.    Since the Amanita group is made responsible by competent authority for  most of the recorded cases of fatal poisoning, we would recommend the  amateur mycophagist to give special study to this group in order to  learn to separate the species authentically recorded as edible from the  poisonous ones.    Some writers, as a measure of precaution, counsel the rejection of all  species of Amanita. But this is, of course, a matter for individual  preference. There would seem to be no good reason why the observant  student should not learn to discriminate between the edible and the  poisonous species of the Amanita as of any other group, and they should  not be eaten until this discriminating knowledge is acquired.    Saccardo describes fifteen edible species of this group of mushrooms. We  have tested three of this number, which, on account of their abundance  in our locality and their good flavor, we would be loth to discard,  viz., A. rubescens, A. Caesarea, and A. strobiliformis.    A type of the Amanita group, which is named first in the genera of the  order Agaricini, is shown in Fig. 1, Plate B.    By reference to this figure some of the special characteristics of the  group can be observed. There are mushrooms in other genera which show a  volva or sheath at the base of the stem, and which contain edible  species, but in these the stem is ringless. The Volvariae, for instance,  show a conspicuous volva, a stem that is ringless, and pinkish spores.  The Amanitopsis vaginata carries a volva, but no ring. The spores are  white, as in the Amanita.    In gathering mushrooms either for the table or for the herbarium, care  should be taken not to leave any portion of the plant in the ground, so  that no feature shall be lost that will aid in characterizing the  species. In the careless pulling up of the plant the volva in the  volvate species is often left behind.               AGARICINI. Fries.         LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE, OR YELLOWISH).    _Genus Russula_ Fr. The _Russulae_ bear some resemblance to the  _Lactars_, their nearest allies, but are at once distinguished from them  by their want of milk.    They are very abundant in the forests and open woods. The genus is cited  by some authors as the most natural of the agarics, but, as many of the  species very closely resemble each other, it requires careful analysis  to determine them. The plants of this genus are not volvate, and have  neither veil nor ring. The hymenophore is not separate from the trama of  the gills. Although some are pure white, the caps are usually brilliant  in coloring, but the color is very susceptible to atmospheric changes,  and after heavy rains the bright hues fade, sometimes only leaving a  slight trace of the original coloring in the central depression of the  cap.    The cap in youth is somewhat hemispherical, afterwards expanding,  becoming slightly depressed in the centre, somewhat brittle in texture;  gills rigid, fragile, with acute edge; stem thick, blunt, and polished,  usually short. The spores are globose, or nearly so, slightly rough,  white or yellowish, according to the species. In R. virescens the spores  are white, while in R. alutacea the spores are an ochraceous yellow in  tint.    A number of the species are of pleasant flavor, others peppery or acrid.  Out of seventy-two described by Cooke, twenty-four are recorded as  acrid. With some of these the acridity is said to disappear in cooking,  and a few mycophagists claim to have eaten all varieties with impunity.  We have recorded, however, some well authenticated cases of serious  gastric disturbance, accompanied by acute inflammation of the mucous  membrane, caused by the more acrid of these, notably _R. emetica_ and  _R. foetens_, and in view of this fact it would seem a wise precaution  for the _amateur_ collector to discard or at least to use very sparingly  all those which have an acrid or peppery taste, until well assured as to  their wholesomeness.    The _genus Russula_ has been divided into the following tribes or  groups:--Compactae, Furcatae, Rigidae, Heterophylla, and Fragiles. The  species _Russula (Rigidae) virescens_, illustrated in Plate I, belongs  to the tribe Rigidae. In the plants of this group, the cap is absolutely  dry and rigid, destitute of a viscid pellicle; the cuticle commonly  breaking up into flocci or granules; the flesh thick, compact, and firm,  vanishing near the margin, which is never involute, and shows no  striations. The gills are irregular in length, some few reaching half  way to the stem, the others divided, dilated, and extending into a broad  rounded end, stem solid.         [Illustration: Plate I.

The cap of this species is fleshy and dry, the skin breaking into thin  patches. The margin is usually even, but specimens occur which show  striations. The color varies from a light green to a grayish or moldy  green, sometimes tinged with yellow; gills white, free from the stem or  nearly so, unequal, rather crowded; stem white, stout, solid, smooth, at  first hard, then spongy; spores white, nearly globose.    One writer speaks of the \"warts\" of the cap, but the term warts, used in  this connection, refers merely to the patches resulting from the  splitting or breaking up of the epidermis of the cap, and not to such  excrescences called warts, as are commonly observed on the cap of  Amanita muscaria, for instance, which are remnants of the volva.    The _R. virescens_ is not as common as some others of the Russulae, in  some localities, and hitherto seems to have attracted but little  attention as an edible species in this country, although highly esteemed  in Europe. It has been found growing in thin woods in Maryland and in  Virginia from June to November, and we have had reports of its growth  from New York and Massachusetts. The peasants in Italy are in the habit  of toasting these mushrooms over wood embers, eating them afterwards  with a little salt. Vittadini, Roques, and Cordier speak highly of its  esculent qualities and good flavor. We have eaten quantities of the  virescens gathered in Washington, D. C., and its suburbs, and found it  juicy and of good flavor when cooked.         EXPLANATION OF PLATE I.

The plants of this genus have been divided into two tribes, viz.,  _Pelliculosi_ and _Veliformis_. In the _Pelliculosi_ the gills of the  mushrooms are covered with a fleshy or membranaceous cuticle, hence the  cap is not furrowed along the lines of the gills, but is torn and  revolute. In this tribe are included the _Comati_, _Atramentarii_,  _Picacei_, _Tomentosi_, _Micacio_ and _Glabrati_. In the tribe  _Veliformis_ the plants are generally very small, and the cap much  thinner than in those of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#5)"],[1,"a watery eye is usually a sign  of weakness. It is necessary to guard against birds which show any  tendency toward crooked or roach back, hump back, crooked tails, or  twisted wings. Since all breeds of ducks should have clean or  unfeathered legs it is likewise necessary to guard against any breeders  which show down on the shanks or between the toes as this sometimes  occurs.    [Footnote 1: For a more detailed discussion of the principles of  breeding as applied to chickens and which is equally applicable to  ducks, the reader is referred to \"The Mating and Breeding of Poultry\" by  Harry M. Lamon and Rob R. Slocum, published by the Orange Judd  Publishing Company, New York City.]    In selecting the mating for any one of the meat breeds use birds which  have good length, width and depth of body so that they will have plenty  of meat carrying capacity. For breeders of market ducks, birds which  are active, well matured and which are not extreme in size for the breed  are preferable as the fertility is likely to run better than with the  extremely large birds. Where birds are bred for exhibition purposes, it  frequently happens that it is desirable to use large breeders and to  hold them for breeding purposes as long as they are in good breeding  condition. Where this is the case it becomes necessary to mate a smaller  number of females to a drake than would be the case with smaller and  younger breeders. Where old birds are used as breeders better results  will be secured by mating old ducks to a young drake or vice versa than  by mating together old birds of both sexes. While ducks of any of the  meat breeds are kept primarily for meat production, it is essential that  the egg production be good throughout the breeding season in order to  raise as many ducklings and secure as great a profit as possible.  Selection of the females as breeders should be made therefore on the  basis of good egg production as well as good meat type if the conditions  under which the ducks are kept are such as to make it possible to check  this in any manner.    In selecting the mating in the Runner breed it is necessary to keep in  mind that the general type of body is quite different from that of the  meat breeds, being much slimmer and much more upright in body carriage.  For this mating select thrifty, healthy birds and those which are  active. Some breeders trapnest their Runner ducks or have some other  means of checking up the better layers. As in chickens, it is of course  desirable to use these better layers as breeders since the purpose in  keeping this kind of duck is primarily egg production.    In selecting the mating in the Call and East India breeds it is  necessary to use the smaller ducks since the object here is to keep the  size small. In addition, with these breeds or with any other breeds kept  and bred primarily for fancy or exhibition purposes, it is necessary to  conform just as closely as possible to the standard requirements[2] both  insofar as size and type are concerned, and also with respect to color.    [Footnote 2: For a complete and official description and list of  disqualifications of the standard breeds and varieties of ducks, the  reader is referred to the American Standard of Perfection published by  the American Poultry Association, and obtained by Orange Judd Publishing  Company, New York, N. Y.]      Breeds of Ducks    _The Pekin._ While this variety wants to be of good size and to have  length, breadth and depth of body it is somewhat more upstanding than  some of the other meat breeds, showing a definite slope of body downward  from shoulders to tail. The back line of the Pekin should show a slight  concavity from the shoulders to the tail and the upper line of the bill  is likewise slightly concave between the point where it joins the head  and its extremity. The shoulders should be broad and any tendency  toward narrowness at this point must be avoided. While a good depth of  keel is desired, the standard does not call for so deep a keel as in the  Aylesbury. As a matter of fact, however, the winning specimens as seen  in the shows are not as a rule as erect in carriage as called for by the  standard illustration, there being a tendency to get them almost if not  quite as deep in keel as the Aylesbury. In fact, some breeders seem to  strive for a low down keel approaching a condition where they are nearly  as low in front as behind but this is not desirable Pekin type.    Sometimes a drake will show a rough neck, that is, the feathers on the  back of the neck will be crossed or folded over showing a tendency to  curl. These birds should be avoided as breeders since there is a  tendency for them to produce ducks having a crest. Sometimes a green or  a greenish spotted bill will be encountered. Since the bill should be a  clear yellow, breeders showing this defect should be avoided  particularly as they are likely to produce birds having greenish or  olive colored legs. The shanks and toes should be a clear deep orange.  Black sometimes occurs in the bean. This may occur in birds of either  sex but is more common in the ducks than in the drakes. In the drake  black in the bean disqualifies but while it is undesirable and a serious  defect in the duck it does not disqualify. The color of the plumage is  white or creamy white throughout. Creaminess in this variety is not a  serious defect as it is in white chickens. The use, however, of yellow  corn and of foods very rich in oil tends to increase the creaminess of  the plumage and should not be used to excess for birds which are to be  exhibited.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Upper--Young Pekins which on account of their  size, thriftiness and rapid growth were selected out of a lot about to  be killed for market and saved for breeders. Lower--Aylesbury  Drake--Notice the depth and development of the breast. (_Photographs  from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _The Aylesbury._ This breed is particularly noted for its deep keel. It  differs from the Pekin in type in that it is more nearly level in body.  There is a decided tendency for the Aylesbury to run too short in body  which has probably come about by extreme selection for deep keel. It is  well, therefore, in making the mating to select breeders with good  length of body. Since the deep full breast and keel is characteristic of  this breed it is necessary to avoid breeders which show any tendency  toward a flat breast. As in the case of the Pekins avoid any birds which  have green or olive colored bills. The back line of the Aylesbury should  be straight, showing no tendency toward a slight concavity as in the  Pekin. Birds showing this shape back should be avoided. As in the Pekin  black on the bill or bean of the drake will disqualify and in the duck  is a serious defect. The color of plumage should be white throughout and  should show no tendency toward creaminess. The bill in this breed is  flesh colored instead of yellow as in the Pekin. The Aylesbury is not  quite as nervous a breed as the Pekin.    _The Rouen._ The Rouen duck is a parti-colored breed and is therefore  much more difficult to secure in perfection of color and marking than  is the case with the white breeds. Moreover, the dark pin feathers make  the ducks more difficult to dress than in white breeds. In type these  birds are very level in body and are massive, carrying a great deal of  meat. Avoid birds showing a lack of length of body or depth of keel or  which are too flat in breast. The back of the Rouen should have a  slightly convex or arched shape from neck to tail and it is necessary to  guard against birds which have a flat or a concave back. The body of the  Rouen should be carried practically horizontal. The upper line of the  bill should be slightly dished or concave. The white ring about the neck  of the drake is an important part of the marking. This should not be too  wide but should run about a quarter of an inch in width. It should be as  distinct and clean cut as possible but should not quite come together in  the rear. Any approach to a ring in the female is a disqualification.  White in the primary or secondary wing feathers is a serious defect  since it constitutes a disqualification. It must therefore be carefully  avoided. White feathers in the fluff of the drake is another color  defect which must be guarded against.    _Breast of Drake._ The farther the claret color on the breast of the  drake extends down the better will be the females secured from the  mating. Drakes which are deficient in the amount of claret on the breast  should therefore be thrown out as breeders. A purple rump in drakes must  be avoided as must black feathers over the rump as they tend to keep  up too dark a body color in the female. On the other hand too bright or  light a color in the male or exhibition female will produce females  which are too light in color. Drakes with light olive colored bills must  be avoided as these will have a tendency to produce offspring which show  too much yellow in the females' bills, and clear yellow bills constitute  a disqualification. In the females solid yellow bills, fawn colored  breasts and absence of penciling must be avoided. Females which are dark  or nearly black over the rump are good breeders as they tend to keep up  the ground color of the body and tail.    The Rouen shows some tendency to fade in color. This is evidenced first  on the tips of the wings. The fading will also show in the fluff of  drakes. The drakes of this breed and likewise of the Gray Call and the  Mallard show a peculiar behavior with respect to the color of their  plumage. About June 1 the drakes moult, losing their characteristic male  adult plumage and the new plumage is practically that of the female.  This female plumage is retained until about October when they gradually  regain their normal winter male plumage. Young Rouens of both sexes have  female"]]]
