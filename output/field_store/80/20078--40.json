Until within a few years it was  universally believed--and it is still commonly supposed--that birds  needed grit to take the place of the teeth nature did not give them, and  assist in the grinding of the food in the gizzard. Many close observers  now reject this idea because they find that birds supplied with  digestible mineral foods do not eat those that are not digestible. A  bird does not need teeth to grind its food, because it is softened in  the crop and the gastric juice acts upon it before the grinding process  begins.    =Peculiarities of birds' eggs.= The only animal foodstuff produced in a  natural package, easily preserved and handled, is the egg. In the  vegetable world we have a great many such things--fruits, seeds, roots,  nuts, with coverings of various textures to protect the contents from  the air. In all of these the material stored up is either for the  nourishment of the seeds in the first stages of growth as plants, or for  the nourishment of a new or special growth. An egg is the seed of an  animal. All animals produce eggs, but in mammals the new life  originating from the egg goes through the embryonic stages within the  body of the parent, while in insects, fishes, reptiles, and birds the  egg is laid by the creature producing it before the embryo begins to  develop.    In mammals the embryo grows as a part of the body of the parent, the  substances which build it up coming from the parent form as they are  needed. In birds a tiny germ--the true egg--is put, with all the  material needed for its development as an embryo, in a sealed package,  which may be taken thousands of miles away from the parent, and, after  lying dormant for weeks, may begin to grow as soon as the proper  conditions of temperature are applied. The food value of the germ of an  egg is inappreciable. We use the egg to get the material stored up in it  for the young bird which would come from the germ.    =Development of the egg.= The method of the formation of an egg is very  interesting. It is the same in all birds, but is most conveniently  studied in fowls. If a laying hen is killed and the body is opened so  that the internal organs can all be seen, one of the most conspicuous of  these is a large, convoluted duct having its outlet at the vent. In this  duct, which is called the oviduct, are eggs in various stages of  formation. At its upper extremity, attached to the backbone, is a bunch  of globular yellow substances which are at once identified as yolks of  eggs in all sizes. The organ to which these are attached is the ovary.  The smallest yolks are so small that they cannot be seen without a  powerful microscope. These yolks are not germs, but as they grow the  germ forms on one side of each yolk, where it appears as a small white  spot.    When a yolk is full-grown it drops into the funnel-shaped mouth of the  oviduct. Here it is inclosed in a membranous covering, called the  chalazae, and receives a coating of thick albumen. The function of the  chalazae is to keep the yolk suspended in the center of the egg. It does  not merely inclose the yolk, but, twisted into cords, extends from  either end and is attached to the outer membrane at the end of the egg.    After leaving the funnel the egg passes into a narrow part of the  oviduct, called the isthmus, where it receives the membranous coverings  which are found just inside the shell. From the isthmus it goes into the  lowest part of the oviduct--the uterus. Here the shell is formed, and at  the same time a thin albumen enters through the pores of the shell and  the shell membranes and dilutes the thick albumen first deposited. After  this process is completed the egg may be retained in the oviduct for  some time. It is, however, usually laid within a few hours.    =Rate and amount of egg production.= In the wild state a bird, if not  molested after it begins laying, produces a number of eggs varying in  different kinds, according to the number of young that can be cared for,  and then incubates them. If its first eggs are removed or destroyed,  the bird lays more, usually changing the location of its nest. In  domestication the eggs of most kinds of birds are removed from the nests  daily as laid, and the birds lay many more eggs before they stop to  incubate than they do in the wild state.    It is, and has been for ages, the common opinion that the wild birds and  poultry, when first domesticated, were capable of laying only a small  number of eggs each season, and that laying capacity has been enormously  increased in domestication; but the oldest reports that we have of the  amount of egg production indicate that the laying capacity of fowls was  as great centuries ago as it is at the present time. Recent observations  on wild birds in captivity show that even birds which pair and usually  lay only a few eggs each season have a laying capacity at least equal to  the ordinary production of hens. Quails in captivity have been known to  lay about one hundred eggs in a season, and an English sparrow from  which the eggs were taken as laid produced over sixty.    The constitutional capacity to produce ovules is now known to be far  greater than the power of any bird to supply the material for the  nourishment of germs through the embryonic stage. The principal factors  in large egg production are abundance of food and great capacity for  digesting and assimilating it.    =Incubation.= A bird before beginning to lay makes a nest. Some birds  build very elaborate and curious nests; others merely put together a few  sticks, or hollow out a little place on the ground. In birds that pair,  the male and female work together to build the nest. Even in polygamous  domestic birds like the fowl and the duck, a male will often make a nest  for the females of his family and coax them to it as a cock pigeon does  his mate.    If the birds are left to themselves and the eggs are not molested, an  aerial bird will usually lay a number of eggs equal to the number of  young the parents can feed as long as they require this attention, while  a terrestrial or aquatic bird will usually lay as many eggs as she can  cover. The desired number of eggs having been laid, the process of  incubation by the parents begins.    The incubation of their eggs by birds is one of the most remarkable  things in nature. We say that \"instinct\" leads birds to build their  nests and to keep their eggs warm for a period varying from two weeks  for small birds, to six weeks for the ostrich; but \"instinct\" is only a  term to describe the apparently intelligent actions of the lower  animals, which we say have not intelligence enough to know the reasons  for the things that they do.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Sitting hen]    The mother of a young mammal knows that it came from herself, and she  can see that it is like her and others of her kind. It at once seeks her  care and responds to her attentions. The egg which a bird lays is as  lifeless--to all appearances--as the stones which it often so closely  resembles. Only after many days or weeks of tiresomely close attention  does it produce a creature which can respond to the care lavished upon  it. The birds incubating eggs not only give them the most unremitting  attention, but those that fill their nests with eggs before beginning to  incubate methodically turn the eggs and change their position in the  nest, this being necessary because otherwise the eggs at the center of  the nest would get too much heat and those at the outside would not get  enough. A bird appears to know that if she begins to sit before she has  finished laying, some of the eggs would be spoiled or would hatch before  the others; and, as noted above, aerial birds seem to know better than  to hatch more young than they can rear. But no bird seems to have any  idea of the time required to hatch its eggs, or to notice the lapse of  time, or to care whether the eggs upon which it sits are of its own  kind or of some other kind, or to know whether the young when hatched  are like or unlike itself. If eggs fail to hatch, domestic birds will,  as a rule, remain on the nest until the eggs are taken away or until  sheer exhaustion compels them to abandon the hopeless task. In  domestication, however, those birds which continue laying most freely  when their eggs are removed as laid, tend to lose the habit of  incubation. Turkeys and geese will often begin to incubate after having  laid about the number of eggs that they could cover. Many fowls will do  the same, but most fowls lay for several months before attempting to  incubate, and in many races not more than two or three per cent of the  hens ever incubate.

Chick ready to break shell]    =Development of the embryo in a bird's egg.= The condition required to  produce a live bird from a fertile egg is the continuous application of  a temperature of about 102 or 103 degrees Fahrenheit from the time the  heat is first applied until the embryo is fully developed and ready to  emerge from the shell. In nature the heat is applied by contact with the  bodies of the parent birds. Development of life will start in an egg at  about 10 degrees below the temperature required to maintain it, but at  this temperature the germ soon dies. The temperature in incubation may  occasionally go higher than 103 degrees or may be as low as 70 degrees  for a short time without injury to the germ.

What is  playing?\"    I could hardly believe my ears.    \"What is what?\" said I.    \"You said you were playing, sir,\" said he, \"and I don't know exactly  what you mean.\"    \"Why,\" said I, scratching my head hard in a mad quest for a definition,  for I couldn't for the life of me think of the answer to his question  offhand, any more than I could define one of the elements. \"Playing  is--why, it's playing, laddie. Don't you know what it is to play?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said he. \"It's what you do on the piano--I've been taught to  play on the piano, sir.\"    \"Oh, but this is different,\" said I. \"This kind is fun--it's what most  little boys do with their toys.\"    \"You mean--breaking them?\" said he.    \"No, indeed,\" said I. \"It's getting all the fun there is out of them.\"    \"I think I should like to do that,\" said he, with a fixed gaze upon the  soldiers. \"Can a little fellow like me learn to play that way?\"    \"Well, rather, kiddie,\" said I, reaching out and taking him by the  hand. \"Sit down here on the floor alongside of me, and I'll show you.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said he, drawing back; \"I--I can't sit on the floor. I'd catch  cold.\"    \"Now, who under the canopy told you that?\" I demanded, somewhat  impatiently, I fear.    \"My governesses and both my nurses, sir,\" said he. \"You see, there are  drafts--\"    \"Well, there won't be any drafts this time,\" said I. \"Just you sit down  here, and we'll have a game of marbles--ever play marbles with your  father?\"    \"No, sir,\" he replied. \"He's always too busy, and neither of my nurses  has ever known how.\"    \"But your mother comes up here and plays games with you sometimes,  doesn't she?\" I asked.    \"Mother is busy, too,\" said the child. \"Besides, she wouldn't care for a  game which you had to sit on the floor to--\"    I sprang to my feet and lifted him bodily in my arms, and, after  squatting him over by the fireplace where if there were any drafts at  all they would be as harmless as a summer breeze, I took up a similar  position on the other side of the room, and initiated him into the  mystery of miggles as well as I could, considering that all his marbles  were real agates.    \"You don't happen to have a china-alley anywhere, do you?\" I asked.    \"No, sir,\" he answered. \"We only have china plates--\"    \"Never mind,\" I interrupted. \"We can get along very nicely with these.\"    And then for half an hour, despite the rich quality of our  paraphernalia, that little boy and I indulged in a glorious game of real  plebeian miggs, and it was a joy to see how quickly his stiff little  fingers relaxed and adapted themselves to the uses of his eye, which was  as accurate as it was deeply blue. So expert did he become that in a  short while he had completely cleaned me out, giving joyous little cries  of delight with every hit, and then we turned our attention to the  soldiers.    \"I want some playing now,\" he said gleefully, as I informed him that he  had beaten me out of my boots at one of my best games. \"Show me what you  were doing with those soldiers when I came in.\"    \"All right,\" said I, obeying with alacrity. \"First, we'll have a  parade.\"    I started a great talking-machine standing in one corner of the room off  on a spirited military march, and inside of ten minutes, with his  assistance, I had all the troops out and to all intents and purposes  bravely swinging by to the martial music of Sousa.    \"How's that?\" said I, when we had got the whole corps arranged to our  satisfaction.    \"Fine!\" he cried, jumping up and down upon the floor and clapping his  hands with glee. \"I've got lots more of these stored away in my  toy-closet,\" he went on, \"but I never knew that you could do such things  as this with them.\"    \"But what did you think they were for?\" I asked.    \"Why--just to--to keep,\" he said hesitatingly.    \"Wait a minute,\" said I, wheeling a couple of cannon off to a distance  of a yard from the passing troops. \"I'll show you something else you can  do with them.\"    I loaded both cannon to the muzzle with dried pease, and showed him how  to shoot.    \"Now,\" said I, \"_fire_!\"    He snapped the spring, and the dried pease flew out like death-dealing  shells in war. In a moment the platinum commander of the forces, and  about thirty-seven solid silver warriors, lay flat on their backs. It  needed only a little red ink on the carpet to reproduce in miniature a  scene of great carnage, but I shall never forget the expression of  mingled joy and regret on his countenance as those creatures went down.    \"Don't you like it, son?\" I asked.    \"I don't know,\" he said, with an anxious glance at the prostrate  warriors. \"They aren't deaded, are they?\"    \"Of course not,\" said I, restoring the presumably defunct troopers to  life by setting them up again. \"The only thing that'll dead a soldier  like these is to step on him. Try the other gun.\"    Thus reassured, he did as I bade him, and again the proud paraders went  down, this time amid shouts of glee. And so we passed an all too  fleeting two hours, that little boy and I. Through the whole list of his  famous toys we went, and as well as I could I taught him the delicious  uses of each and all of them, until finally he seemed to grow weary, and  so, drawing up a big arm-chair before the fire and taking his tired  little body into my lap, with his tousled head cuddled up close over the  spot where my heart is alleged to be, I started to read a story to him  out of one of the many beautiful books that had been provided for him  by his generous parents. But I had not gone far when I saw that his  attention was wandering.    \"Perhaps you'd rather have me tell you a story instead of reading it,\"  said I.    \"What's to tell a story?\" he asked, fixing his blue eyes gravely upon  mine.    \"Great Scott, kiddie!\" said I, \"didn't anybody ever tell you a story?\"    \"No, sir,\" he replied sleepily; \"I get read to every afternoon by my  governess, but nobody ever told me a story.\"    \"Well, just you listen to this,\" said I, giving him a hearty squeeze.  \"Once upon a time there was a little boy,\" I began, \"and he lived in a  beautiful house not far from the Park, and his daddy--\"    \"What's a daddy?\" asked the child, looking up into my face.    \"Why, a daddy is a little boy's father,\" I explained. \"You've got a  daddy--\"    \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"If a daddy is a father, I've got one. I saw him  yesterday,\" he added.    \"Oh, did you?\" said I. \"And what did he say to you?\"    \"He said he was glad to see me and hoped I was a good boy,\" said the  child. \"He seemed very glad when I told him I hoped so, too, and he gave  me all these things here--he and my mother.\"    \"That was very nice of them,\" said I huskily.    \"And they're both coming up some time to-day or to-morrow to see if I  like them,\" said the lad.    \"And what are you going to say?\" I asked, with difficulty getting the  words out over a most unaccountable lump that had arisen in my throat.    \"I'm going to tell them,\" he began, as his eyes closed sleepily, \"that I  like them all very, very much.\"    \"And which one of them all do you like the best?\" said I.    He snuggled up closer in my arms, and, raising his little head a trifle  higher, he kissed me on the tip end of my chin, and murmured softly as  he dropped off to sleep,    \"You!\"      III    \"Good night,\" said my spectral visitor as she left me, once more bending  over my desk, whither I had been re-transported without my knowledge,  for I must have fallen asleep, too, with that little boy in my arms.  \"You have done a good night's work.\"    \"Have I?\" said I, rubbing my eyes to see if I were really awake. \"But  tell me--who was that little kiddie anyhow?\"    \"He?\" she answered with a smile. \"Why, he is the Child Who Has  Everything But--\"    And then she vanished from my sight.    \"Everything but what?\" I cried, starting up and peering into the  darkness into which she had disappeared.    But there was no response, and I was left alone to guess the answer to  my question.          A HOLIDAY WISH          When Santa Claus doth visit me        With richly laden pack of toys,      And tumbles down my chim-i-ney        To scatter 'round his Christmas joys,      I trust that he will bring the kind        That can be shared, for it is true      Past peradventure to my mind        That joy is sweeter shared by two.        I never cared for solitaire.        I do not pine for lonely things.      I love the pleasure I can share        Because of all the fun it brings.      A selfish pleasure loses zest        With none to share it with you by,      And shrinks the longer 'tis possest,        While joys divided multiply.          SANTA CLAUS AND LITTLE BILLEE      I    He was only a little bit of a chap, and so, when for the first time in  his life he came into close contact with the endless current of human  things, it was as hard for him to \"stay put\" as for some wayward little  atom of flotsam and jetsam to keep from tossing about in the surging  tides of the sea.    His mother had left him there in the big toy-shop, with instructions not  to move until she came back, while she went off to do some mysterious  errand. She thought, no doubt, that with so many beautiful things on  every side to delight his eye and hold his attention, strict obedience  to her commands would not be hard. But, alas, the good lady reckoned not  upon the magnetic power of attraction of all those lovely objects in  detail. She saw them only as a mass of wonders which, in all  probability, would so dazzle his vision as to leave him incapable of  movement; but Little Billee was not so indifferent as all that.
