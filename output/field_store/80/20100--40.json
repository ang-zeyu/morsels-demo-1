None of these were absolutely house cats, but attended more to the  poultry yards and runs, looking after the chicken, seeing that no rats  were about or other \"vermin,\" near the coops. Useful cats, very!    Mine was then a very large garden, and generally of an evening, when at  home, I used to walk about the numerous paths to admire the beauties of  the different herbaceous plants, of which I had an interesting  collection. Five was my time of starting on my ambulation, when, on  going out of the door, I was sure to find the two first-named cats, and  often the third, waiting for me, ready to go wherever I went, following  like faithful dogs. These apparently never had any jealous feeling.    Of all the cats Lillah was the most loving. If I stood still, she would  look up, and watch the expression of my face. If she thought it was  favourable to her, she would jump, and, clinging to my chest, put her  fore-paws around my neck, and rub her head softly against my face,  purring melodiously all the time, then move on to my shoulder, while  \"The Colonel\" and his tortoiseshell friend Lizzie would press about my  legs, uttering the same musical self-complacent sound. Here, there, and  everywhere, even out into the road or into the wood, the pretty things  would accompany me, seeming intensely happy. When I returned to the  house, they would scamper off, bounding in the air, and playing with and  tumbling over each other in the fullest and most frolicsome manner  imaginable. No! I do not think that Lillah, The Colonel, or Lizzie ever  knew the feeling of jealousy. But these, as I said before, were  exceptions. They all had a sad ending, coming to an untimely death  through being caught in wires set by poachers for rabbits. I have ever  regretted the loss of the gentle Lillah. She was as beautiful as she was  good, gentle, and loving, without a fault.    It may have been noted in the foregoing I have said that my cats were  always awaiting my coming. Just so. The cat seems to take note of time  as well as place. At my town house I had a cat named Guadalquiver, which  was fed on horseflesh brought to the door. Every day during the week he  would go and sit ready for the coming of \"the cat's-meat man,\" but he  never did so on the Sunday. How it was he knew on that day that the man  did not come I never could discover; still, the fact remains. How he, or  whether he, counted the days until the sixth, and then rested the  seventh from his watching, is a mystery. A similar case is related of an  animal belonging to Mr. Truebner, the London publisher. The cat, a  gigantic one, and a pet of his, used to go every evening to the end of  the terrace, on which was the house where he resided, to escort Mr.  Truebner back to dinner on his arrival from the City, but was never once  known to make the mistake of going to meet him on Sundays. And again,  how well a cat knows when it is luncheon-time! He or she may be  apparently asleep on the tiles, or snugly lying under a bush basking in  the sun's warm rays, when it will look up, yawn, stretch itself, get up,  and move leisurely towards the house, and as the luncheon-bell rings, in  walks the cat, as ready for food as any there.    Most cats are of a gentle disposition, but resent ill-treatment in a  most determined way, generally making use of their claws, at the same  time giving vent to their feelings by a low growl and spitting  furiously. Under such conditions it is best to leave off that which has  appeared to irritate them. Dogs generally bite when they lose their  temper, but a cat seldom. Should a cat dig her claws into your hand,  never draw it backward, but push forward; you thus close the foot and  render the claws harmless. If otherwise, you generally lose three to  four pieces of skin from your hand; the cat knows he has done it, and  feels revenged. Some cats do not like their ears touched, others their  backs, others their tails. I have one now (Fritz); he has such a great  dislike to having his tail touched that if we only point to it and say  \"Tail!\" he growls, and if repeated he will get up and go out of the  room, even though he was enjoying the comfort of his basket before a  good fire. By avoiding anything that is known to tease an animal, no  matter what, it will be found that is the true way, combined with gentle  treatment and oft caressing, to tame and to make them love you, even  those whose temper is none of the best. This is equally applicable to  horses, cows, and dogs as to cats. Gentleness and kindness will work  wonders with animals, and, I take it, is not lost on human beings.    The distance cats will travel to find and regain the home they have been  taken from is surprising. One my groom begged of me, as he said he had  no cat at home, and he was fond of \"the dear thing,\" but he really  wanted to be rid of it, as I found afterwards. He took the poor animal  away in a hamper, and after carrying it some three miles through London  streets, threw it into the Surrey Canal. That cat was sitting wet and  dirty outside the stable when he came in the morning, and went in  joyfully on his opening the door, ran up to and climbed on to the back  of its favourite, the horse, who neighed a \"welcome home.\" The man left  that week.    Another instance, and I could give many more, but this will suffice. It  is said that if you wish an old cat to stay you should have the mother  with the kitten or kittens, but this sometimes fails to keep her. Having  a fancy for a beautiful brown tabby, I purchased her and kitten from a  cottager living two miles and a half away. The next day I let her out,  keeping the kitten in a basket before the fire. In half an hour mother  and child were gone, and though she had to carry her little one through  woods, hedgerows, across grass and arable fields, she arrived home with  her young charge quite safely the following day, though evidently very  tired, wet, and hungry. After two days she was brought back, and being  well fed and carefully tended, she roamed no more.    The cat, like many other animals, will often form singular attachments.  One would sit in my horse's manger and purr and rub against his nose,  which undoubtedly the horse enjoyed, for he would frequently turn his  head purposely to be so treated. One went as consort with a Dorking  cock; another took a great liking to my collie, Rover; another loved  Lina, the cow; while another would cosset up close to a sitting hen, and  allowed the fresh-hatched chickens to seek warmth by creeping under her.  Again, they will rear other animals such as rats, rabbits, squirrels,  puppies, hedgehogs; and, when motherly inclined, will take to almost  anything, even to a young pigeon.    At the Brighton Show of 1886 there were two cats, both reared by dogs,  the foster-mother and her bantling showing evident signs of sincere  affection.    There are both men and women who have a decided antipathy to  cats--\"Won't have one in the house on any account.\" They are called  \"deceitful,\" and some go as far as to say \"treacherous,\" but how and in  what way I cannot discover. Others, on the contrary, love cats beyond  all other \"things domestic.\" Of course cats, like other animals, or even  human beings, are very dissimilar, no two being precisely alike in  disposition, any more than are to be found two forms so closely  resembling as not to be distinguished one from the other. To some a cat  is a cat, and if all were black all would be alike. But this would not  be so in reality, as those well know who are close observers of animal  and bird life. Of course the gamekeeper has a dislike to cats, more  especially when they \"take to the woods,\" but so long as they are fed,  and keep within bounds, they are \"useful\" in scaring away rats from the  young broods of pheasants. What are termed \"poaching cats\" are clearly  \"outlaws,\" and must be treated as such.          TRAINED CATS.      That cats may be trained to respect the lives of other animals, and also  birds on which they habitually feed, is a well-known fact. In proof of  this I well recollect a story that my father used to tell of \"a happy  family\" that was shown many years ago on the Surrey side of Waterloo  Bridge. Their abode consisted of a large wire cage placed on wheels. In  windy weather the \"breezy side\" was protected by green baize, so  draughts were prevented, and a degree of comfort obtained. As there was  no charge for \"the show,\" a box was placed in front with an opening for  the purpose of admitting any donations from those who felt inclined to  give. On it was written \"The Happy Family--their money-box.\" The family  varied somewhat, as casualties occurred occasionally by death from  natural causes or sales. Usually, there was a Monkey, an Owl, some  Guinea-pigs, Squirrels, small birds, Starlings, a Magpie, Rats, Mice,  and a Cat or two. But the story? Well, the story is this. One day, when  my father was looking at \"the happy family,\" a burly-looking man came  up, and, after a while, said to the man who owned the show: \"Ah! I don't  see much in that. It is true the cat does not touch the small birds [one  of which was sitting on the head of the cat at the time], nor the other  things; but you could not manage to keep rats and mice in there as  well.\" \"Think not?\" said the showman. \"I think I could very easily.\"  \"Not you,\" said the burly one. \"I will give you a month to do it in, if  you like, and a shilling in the bargain if you succeed. I shall be this  way again soon.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said the man. \"Don't go yet,\" then,  putting a stick through the bars of the cage he lifted up the cat, when  from beneath her out ran a white rat and three white mice.  \"Won--der--ful!\" slowly"]]]
