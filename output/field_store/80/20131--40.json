I have been asked to give a few hints as to the best and most useful  classification for show purposes, and may as well do so here.  For a  large show, the classes can hardly be better arranged than they are in  the Crystal Palace catalogue, or that of the Edinburgh or Glasgow Shows.  For smaller shows I beg to suggest the following:--    ONE.  Long-haired cats, any colour, male or female.    TWO.  Short-haired black and black-and-white, and white.    THREE.  Short-haired tabbies, any colour.    FOUR.  Short-haired tortoiseshell and tortoise-and-white.    FIVE.  Anomalous, as Manx, etc.    The first class would include Persian, Angora, and other long-haired  cats--black, white, tabby, or tortoiseshell.  The third class would  include all tabbies--brown, red, and grey or silver.  Class Four must  have tortoiseshell-and-white as well as tortoiseshell, or it will be a  small class, owing to the rarity of the pure tortoiseshell.  The last  class will give a place to Manx, six-toed cats, wild cats, and hybrids,  as well as any curious foreign pussy that may be forthcoming.  At all  shows you find a great many cats entered in the wrong class.  I think it  a pity that secretaries don't arrange these in their proper classes; it  is not right to exclude merit through mistake.  In judging, prizes  should be withheld where there is no competition; and where there is  want of merit in any one class, some of the prizes should be withdrawn  and added to any class of _extra_ merit.  We come now to the  _black-and-white cat_.    A good black-and-white cat is a very noble-looking animal.  If  well-trained and looked after, you can hardly have a nicer parlour pet.  He is affectionate in his disposition, and cleanly and gentlemanly, so  to speak, and makes himself quite an ornament to a well-furnished  drawing-room.  I must speak, however, of the demerits of my pets, as  well as of their good qualities, and feel constrained to say that I have  sometimes found black-and-white Tom a pussy who did not trouble himself  too much about his duties as house-cat; he much preferred the parlour to  the kitchen, a good bed to a hay-loft, and seemed to think that catching  mean little mice was far below his dignity.  If well treated black and  white cats are apt to turn a little indolent and lazy, and if improperly  fed and housed, they degenerate into the most wretched-looking specimens  of felinity you ever looked upon.  All the bad in their character comes  out, and their good qualities are forgotten.  Their coat gets dry, and  tear, and are cinder-holed; and, instead of the plump, round-faced,  clerical-looking cat which used to adorn your parlour window, you have a  thin, emaciated, long-nosed, pigeon-loft-hunting, flower-unscraping,  dirty, disreputable dunghill cat.  Of course, the same may, to a certain  extent, be said of most neglected cats, but the two breeds that show to  the least advantage, when ill-used, are the black-and-white and the  red-and-white, and more especially the former.    _Merits_.--I like these cats more for their appearance than anything  else.  When nicely marked they look reverend and respectable in the  extreme.  I consider them but very ordinary pussies in regard to  house-hunting.  A naval officer who cannot go to quarters without having  his hands encased in white kids, and a black-and-white cat, carry on  duty much on a par.  Neither do these cats make over good children's  pets, being at times a little selfish.  They are beautiful creatures,  nevertheless, and well worthy of a place at our parlour firesides.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: As big as possible, but not leggy; reasonably  plump for the show-bench, but _very_ graceful in all their motions; with  stoutish short forelegs, and plenty of spring in the hindquarters.    2.  _Head_: The best black-and-white Toms have large, well-rounded  heads, with moderately long ears, and a well-pleased, self-contented  expression of face.  The whiskers are usually white, but black is not  objectionable.  The eyes are preferred green, and sparkling like  emeralds of the finest water.    3.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is black-and-white, with as much  of the former, and as little of the latter as you can find.  I like to  see the nose and cheeks vandyked with white, the chin black, white  fore-paws, white hind legs and belly, and a white chest.  This is all  that is needed for beauty's sake; but, at all events, the markings must  be even.    4.  _Pelage_: Fur should be longish (and I don't object to its being  ticked all over the back with longer white hairs), silky, and glossy.

It is very remarkable--and most students of feline nature must have had  an opportunity of observing this--the great difference in the  temperament, constitution, and nature of cats, which colour alone,  apparently, has the power of truly indicating; and this is nowhere more  easily seen than in the peculiar characteristics of the pure black pussy  and the all-white one.  The black cat, on the one hand, is bold, and  free, and fierce; the white, far from brave, more fond of petting and  society, and as gentle as a little white mouse.  The black cat is full  of life and daring; the white of a much quieter and more loving  disposition.  The black cat stands but little \"cuddling;\" the white  would like to be always nursed.  It takes but little pains to teach a  black cat to be perfectly cleanly, but much more to train a pure white  one.  In constitution the black cat is much more hardy and lasting, the  white cat being often delicate, and longing apparently for a sunnier  clime.  A black cat is often afflicted with _kleptomania_, while a  properly-educated white puss is as honest as the day is long.    The senses of the black cat are nearly always in a state of perfection,  while the white is often deaf, and at times a little blind.  Again there  is nothing demoniacal about a white cat, as there often is about a black  one.  I remember, when a little boy at the grammar school of Aberdeen,  receiving a box from the country containing lots of good things, and  marked, \"A Present from Muffle\"--Muffle was a pet tabby of mine--and,  childlike, replying in verse, the last lines of the \"poem\" being--      \"And when at last Death's withering arms        Shall throw his mantle thee around,    May angel catties carry thee        To the happy hunting-ground.\"    Well, a blue-eyed white pussy was my idea of an \"angel cattie\" then, and  it is not altered still.    It will be observed, however, that the colour of the kittens of the same  litter will often differ, and the question naturally comes to be asked,  Do I assert that the nature and temperament of cats in the same litter  will not coincide?  I do so aver most unhesitatingly; and the thing  is easily explained if you bear in mind that a litter of  differently-coloured kittens has had but _one_ mother, but _many_  fathers.  Although born from the same mother in one day, they stand in  the relation to each other of half-brothers and half-sisters.  Except  when the odds in colour is very distinct, as in black, white, or red,  the difference in constitution, etc, will not be so easily perceived,  but it is there, nevertheless.  _Colour follows the breed, and temper  and quality follow colour_.  This is the same all throughout nature, and  is often observed, though but little studied, by dog fanciers.  I have  only to remind pointer and setter men, how often hardiness and good  stamp cling to certain colours.  That \"God tempers the wind to the shorn  lamb,\" I believe to be merely metaphor, but I am ready to go to death on  it that He paints the petals of the flower and the blossoms on the  fruit-tree, to the requirements of the tender seedlings.  What sort of  fruit would you grow in the dark, or under deeply-coloured glass shades?  Lest I be found guilty of digression, I shall say no more now on this  subject.    _Merits of the White Cat_.--A _pet_, gentle and loving above a cat of  any other colour, though at times dull, and cross, and wayward; \"given,\"  as a lady said, \"to moods of melancholy.\"  Not a bad mouser either, when  \"i' th' vein,\" and a good cat for a miller to have, not being easily  seen among sacks of flour.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: Seldom a large cat. 2.  _Head_: Smallish, and as  nicely rounded as possible; ears not too long, and well-feathered  internally; eyes of \"himmel-blue;\" eyes ought to be both the same  colour--if not so, deduct five points. 3.  _Pelage_: Fine, soft, and  glossy; but a too long coat shows a cross with Angora. 4.  _Colour_:  White as driven snow, if intended for a show cat; if not, a very little  black wonderfully improves the constitution.

The Blue cat: just one word about this pretty creature before passing on  to the Tabbies.  Although she is called a blue cat, don't fancy for a  moment that ultramarine is anywhere near her colour, or himmel-blue, or  honest navy serge itself.  Her colour is a sad slate-colour; I cannot  get any nearer to it than that.    Apart from her somewhat sombre appearance, this cat makes a very nice  pet indeed; she is exceedingly gentle and winning, and I'm sure would do  anything rather than scratch a child.  But the less children have to do  with her the better, for all that: for this simple reason--she is a cat  of delicate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37350"],[0,"The Ancestry of Modern Amphibia: A Review of the Evidence (#5)"],[1,"of, labyrinthodonts show some features associated  with aquatic life even when full-grown, as do the lepospondyls. These  features may include impressions of sensory canals on the dermal bones  of the skull, persistence of visceral arches, reduction in size of  appendages, and failure of tarsal and carpal elements to ossify. In  fact, it appears that very few of the Paleozoic Amphibia were successful  in establishing themselves as terrestrial animals even as adults.    Nevertheless, in the ancestry of Anura, and that of at least the  Hynobiid, Ambystomid, Salamandrid and Plethodontid salamanders, there  must certainly have been a terrestrial adult, transforming from an  aquatic larva. The leaping mechanism of Anura, shown in so many features  of their anatomy, is perhaps to be explained as a device for sudden  escape from land into the water, but it was not yet perfected in the  Triassic _Protobatrachus_ or the Jurassic _Notobatrachus_.    The middle ear, its sound-transmitting mechanism, and the tympanum, well  developed in most Anura, are readily derived from those of early  labyrinthodonts, and are presumably effective for hearing airborne  sounds whether on land or while floating in the water. Reduction of  these organs in Urodela may be correlated with their customary  restriction to subsurface habitats and inability to maintain a floating  position while in water.    Some light may be shed on the significance of the tadpole of Anura by  considering the early stages of the ribbed frogs, Liopelmidae.  _Leiopelma_ and _Ascaphus_ are so closely similar in the adult that  there is no doubt that they belong in one family, primitive in some  respects (including articulated ribs; pyriformis and  caudalipuboischiotibialis muscles) but not in others (absence of  tympanum and middle ear). In both genera the eggs are large, 5 mm. in  _Leiopelma_, 4.5 mm. in _Ascaphus_, and unpigmented; but at this point  the resemblance ends.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. _Leiopelma hochstetteri_ larva, lateral and  ventral (after Stephenson, 1955), x4.]    Stephenson (1955) showed that embryos of _L. hochstetteri_ develop  equally well on land (in damp places) or in the water, and that embryos  prematurely released from egg capsules develop successfully in the  water. The larvae possess both pairs of legs (Fig. 10) and a broad gular  fold similar to that of larval salamanders. In _L. hochstetteri_ the  fold grows back over the forelegs temporarily, but remains free from the  body and presently the legs reappear, whereas in _L. archeyi_ the  forelegs are not covered at any time. No branchial chamber or spiracle  is formed. Of course direct development, without a tadpole, occurs in  several other groups of Anura, but in each case terrestrial adaptations  are obvious. This is not true of _Leiopelma_, which Stephenson regards  as more nearly comparable with Urodela in its development than with  other Anura, and he sees in it a \"primary and amphibious\" mode instead  of a terrestrial specialization.    The _Ascaphus_ tadpole bears no outward resemblance to the larva of  _Leiopelma_, but is a normal tadpole in form, although sluggish in  activity. Its greatly expanded labial folds bear numerous rows of horny  epidermal \"teeth,\" which, with the lips, serve to anchor the tadpole to  stones in the swift water of mountain brooks. Noble (1927) noticed that  particles of food were taken in through the external nares, and that a  current of water passed through these openings and out by way of the  median spiracle. It appears that any action by the teeth and jaws in  scraping algae from the rocks (which were bare in the stream where I  have collected _Ascaphus_) would be quite incidental, and that the lips  and teeth must be primarily a clinging mechanism. Certain other mountain  brook tadpoles (for example, _Borborocoetes_) show similar devices, but  these are developed independently, as specializations from the usual  sort of tadpole.    May it not be that closure of the gill-chamber by the opercular (=gular)  fold, retardation of limb development, expansion of the lips, growth of  parallel rows of horny teeth, and other correlated features that make a  tadpole, were brought about as an adaptation of the primitive Anuran  larva to a swift-stream habitat, and that this \"basic patent\" then later  served to admit the tadpoles of descendant types to an alga-scraping  habit in quiet water as well? The tadpole, as a unique larval type among  vertebrates, bears the hallmarks of an abrupt adaptive shift, such as  might have occurred within the limits of a single family, and it seems  difficult to imagine the enclosed branchial chamber, the tooth-rows, and  lips of a familiar tadpole as having evolved without some kind of  suctorial function along the way.          SUMMARY      The Anura probably originated among temnospondylous labyrinthodonts,  through a line represented approximately by _Eugyrinus_, _Amphibamus_,  and the Triassic frog _Protobatrachus_, as shown by Watson, Piveteau and  others. The known Paleozoic lepospondyls do not show clear indications  of a relationship with Urodela, but _Lysorophus_ may well be on the  ancestral stem of the Apoda.    Between Urodela and Anura there are numerous resemblances which seem to  indicate direct relationship through a common stock: (1) a similar  reduction of dermal bones of the skull and expansion of palatal  vacuities; (2) movable basipterygoid articulation in primitive members  of both orders; (3) an operculum formed in the otic capsule, with  opercularis muscle; (4) many details of cranial development, cranial  muscles, and thigh muscles, especially between _Ascaphus_ and the  Urodela, as shown by Pusey and Noble; (5) essentially similar manner of  vertebral development, quite consistent with derivation of both orders  from Temnospondyli; (6) presence in the larva of _Leiopelma_ of a  salamander-like gular fold, four limbs, and no suggestion of  modification from a tadpole (Stephenson).
