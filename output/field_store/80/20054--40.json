N. Atlantic. For all species  exploited by whaling industries' current maximum sizes will be  substantially smaller than these figures (see species accounts).]          DIRECTORY TO SPECIES ACCOUNTS      LARGE WHALES    (40-85 feet [12-26 m] maximum overall length)      With a Dorsal Fin    All five species of large whales with a dorsal fin belong to the same  major baleen whale group, the balaenopterid whales or rorquals. All are  characterized by the presence of a series of ventral grooves, usually  visible on stranded specimens and the length and number of which are  diagnostic to species. In addition, all species, with the exception of  the humpback whale, have at least one distinctive (though often not  prominent) ridge along the head from just in front of the blowhole to  near the tip of the snout. (The humpback whale, on the other hand, is  distinguished by numerous knobs, some of which are located along the  line of the head ridge, with others scattered on the top of the head.)  In Bryde's whale, the single head ridge characteristic of the other  rorquals is supplemented by two auxiliary ridges, one on each side of  the main ridge.    At sea, these whales often appear very similar and must be examined  carefully before they can be reliably identified.    In general, though the characteristics of behavior may vary from one  encounter to the next, based on the activities in which the animal is  engaged, whales in this group may be distinguished from each other on  the basis of differences in 1) the size, shape, and position of the  dorsal fin and the timing of its appearance on the surface relative to  the animal's blow (in general, the larger the whale, the smaller the  dorsal fin--the further back its position and the later its appearance  on the surface after the animal's blow); 2) the height of body in the  area of the dorsal fin, relative to the size of the dorsal fin, which is  exposed as the animal sounds; 3) sometimes the blow rate and movement  patterns; and 4) the shape and color of the head.    Despite variability in behavior by members of the same species from one  encounter to the next, an observer can greatly increase the reliability  of his identification by forming the habit of working systematically  through a set of characteristics for the species rather than depending  on any single characteristic.

Therefore the greatest  number of intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs is found in the  largest specimens. A similar relationship between adpressed limbs (=  length of limbs) and snout-vent length was shown for _Plethodon  richmondi_ by Duellman (1954a). The number of vomerine teeth is  variable; the number of teeth seems to be closely correlated with the  size of the salamander (Fig. 2). A similar correlation between the  number of maxillary teeth and body length was reported for  _Chiropterotriton multidentatus_ by Rabb (1958). In 12 juvenile  _Pseudoeurycea belli_ there are 6-13 (8.8) vomerine teeth, and in 11  adults having snout-vent lengths greater than 90 mm. there are 39-49  (44.0) vomerine teeth. The coloration of the juveniles resembles that of  the adults (Pl. 1).    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Correlation between the number of vomerine teeth  and snout-vent length in 79 _Pseudoeurycea belli_ from Michoacan.]    The differences between this species and _Pseudoeurycea gigantea_ are  minor. Taylor (1939a) distinguished _gigantea_ from _belli_ by the  larger size, fewer intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs, more  vomerine teeth, and absence of occipital spots in _gigantea_. Taylor and  Smith (1945) stated that in life the spots in _gigantea_ are orange  instead of red as in _belli_. Five specimens of _Pseudoeurycea belli_  from Michoacan, including one juvenile, lack occipital spots. In the 34  living individuals that I have seen from Michoacan the spots varied from  deep red to orange. Therefore, of the characters listed by Taylor (_op.  cit._) to diagnose _Pseudoeurycea gigantea_, only the over-all larger  size and smaller number of intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs (=  relatively longer limbs) are useful in separating _Pseudoeurycea belli_  and _gigantea_.      ~Pseudoeurycea robertsi~ (Taylor)         _Oedipus robertsi_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 25:287,       July 10, 1939.--Nevado de Toluca, Mexico.         _Pseudoeurycea robertsi_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       30:209, June 12, 1944.         Atzimba (3); Macho de Agua (9); Puerto Lengua de Vaca (14).    Previously this species has been recorded only from the type locality.  In July, 1956, individuals referable to this species were found at two  sites in pine-fir forest immediately to the east of Macho de Agua and in  pine-oak-fir forest at Atzimba. On August 20, 1958, a series was  collected in pine-fir forest at Puerto Lengua de Vaca. These localities  are between 2900 and 3000 meters in the Cordillera Volcanica in eastern  Michoacan.    In life the coloration of these salamanders was highly variable. The  belly and undersurfaces of the tail and hind limbs were pale gray, with  or without silvery white flecks; the chin was a cream-color and flecked  with silvery white in some specimens. The middorsal area was brown,  orange-brown, or dull grayish yellow. The flanks and lateral surfaces of  the tail were black with yellowish flecks or streaks on the flanks and  yellowish or orange-brown flecks on the tail. The iris was golden brown.  Measurements of eight males and two females are, respectively:  snout-vent length, 42.5-56.0 (49.5), 54.0-60.0 (57.0); tail length,  42.0-56.0 (48.1), 52.0-55.0 (53.5). The smallest juvenile has a  snout-vent length of 28.0 mm. and a tail length of 23.0 mm. Of the 26  available specimens, six have 12 costal grooves, and the others have 11.    In comparison with 36 topotypes, the specimens from Michoacan have a  less striking dorsal color pattern; none has a well-defined dorsal  reddish brown area or bold reddish mottling on the tail. Furthermore,  the specimens from Michoacan have paler venters than do topotypic  specimens.      Salientia      ~Rhinophrynus dorsalis~ Dumeril and Bibron         _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_ Dumeril and Bibron, Erpetologie       generale, vol. 8:758, 1841.--Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico.         Mouth of the Rio Balsas (10).    These specimens (BMNH 1914.1.28.181-90) were collected by Gadow in 1908  and reported by him (1930:72): \"Whilst this very sluggish termite-eating  toad is common enough in the sweltering hot country of the state of Vera  Cruz, up to an elevation of 1500 feet, it was unknown on the west side  of the Isthmus until I found it in great numbers near the mouth of the  Balsas River, in and near fresh-water pools, where it attracted  attention by its loud peculiar voice during the pairing season in the  month of July.\" Subsequently, Peters (1954:3) verified the  identification of these specimens. Although torrential rains fell during  the week in July, 1955, that I spent at Playa Azul near the mouth of the  Rio Balsas, the distinctive voice of _Rhinophrynus_ was not heard.  Elsewhere on the Pacific coast of Mexico adult _Rhinophrynus_ have been  reported only from Tehuantepec and a few localities on the coastal  lowlands of Chiapas. Taylor (1942b:37) found on the coast of Guerrero a  tadpole that was referred to the genus _Rhinophrynus_ by Orton (1943).  In the summer of 1960 adults of _Rhinophrynus_ were collected near  Acapulco, Guerrero (Fouquette, _in litt._). These recent collections  verify the existence of the species along the Pacific lowlands of Mexico  at least as far north as Michoacan.      ~Scaphiopus hammondi multiplicatus~ Cope         _Scaphiopus multiplicatus_ Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.       Philadelphia, 15:52, June 8, 1863.--Valley of Mexico.         _Scaphiopus hammondi multiplicatus_, Kellogg, Bull. U. S.       Natl. Mus., 160:22, March 31, 1932.         Angahuan (5); Cuitzeo (4); Cuseno Station (2); Jiquilpan       (9); Morelia (7); Patzcuaro (3); Quiroga; Tarecuaro; Uruapan       (24); Zacapu.    This small toad has been found at elevations between 1500 and 2500  meters on the Mexican Plateau and associated mountain ranges; it occurs  in mesquite-grassland and in pine forests. Calling males and females  laden with eggs have been collected in the rainy season in the months of  July and August. The call is a medium-pitched snore. In living  individuals the dorsal ground color varies from pale brown to gray with  dark brown or olive-brown markings. In many individuals the tips of the  small dorsal pustules are red.      ~Bufo coccifer~ Cope         _Bufo coccifer_ Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       18:130, 1866--Arriba, Costa Rica.         Apatzingan (27); Lombardia; Nueva Italia (5).    In life the dorsal color pattern consists of a yellowish tan ground  color with dark brown spots; the middorsal stripe is deep yellow or  cream color. The venter is a dusty cream color, and the iris is pale  gold. Males have dark brown horny nuptial tuberosities on the thumb. The  following measurements are of 21 males and four females, respectively:  snout-vent length, 43.5-51.7 (48.1), 55.6-62.6 (59.1); tibia length,  16.6-18.8 (17.6), 18.8-20.3 (19.3); head width, 16.7-19.7 (18.4),  20.6-22.2 (21.4); head length, 13.8-16.6 (14.8), 16.5-18.2 (17.3).    The specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley differ slightly from  specimens from southeastern Mexico and Central America. Those from  Michoacan have low and narrow cranial crests; in about one-half of the  specimens the occipital crest exists only as a row of tubercles, and in  some the postorbital and suborbital crests are barely discernible.  Specimens from the southern part of the range, Costa Rica and Nicaragua,  have much higher and thicker cranial crests; in these the occipital  crest is well defined and extends posteriorly to a point back of the  anterior edge of the parotid gland; the postorbital and suborbital  crests are well marked. Of 48 specimens from Esquipulas, Guatemala, all  have high crests, but these are not so well developed as in ten  specimens from Matagalpa, Nicaragua, and three from various localities  in Costa Rica. Six specimens from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, have cranial  crests that are lower than those in specimens from Guatemala. In three  of the specimens from Tehuantepec the occipital crests are reduced to a  series of tubercles. Of six specimens from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero,  four have poorly developed occipital crests. These observations suggest  the presence of a cline in the development of the cranial crests;  specimens have higher crests in the southern part of the range than in  the northern part.    In Mexico _Bufo coccifer_ has been collected only in semi-xeric  habitats, but to the south, from Guatemala to Costa Rica, it has been  found in more upland and humid habitats. Southern specimens are darker  than those from the north, a possible correlation with the differences  in habitat.    These toads probably range throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley, but they  are unknown from the coast of Michoacan. Breeding choruses were found  after heavy rains on June 24, 1955, and on August 2, 1956. The first was  in a muddy ditch; the second was in a flooded grassy field. The call is  a high-pitched, but not loud, \"whirrr.\" Males were calling from the edge  of the water or from clumps of grass in the water. Clasping pairs were  in the water; amplexus is axillary.      ~Bufo compactilis compactilis~ Wiegmann         _Bufo compactilis_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 26:661,       1833.--Mexico.

All specimens from the state have spotted venters.  In living toads the dorsal ground color was gray or grayish tan with  olive green spots. The vocal sac was brownish gray; the iris was a  bright golden color.    On June 11, 1958, many individuals were calling from shallow water in a  flooded field at"]]]
