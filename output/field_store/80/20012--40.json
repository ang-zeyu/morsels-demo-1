[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31035"],[0,"Mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (#5)"],[1," gophers of the Mesa Verde and vicinity are of one species,  _Thomomys bottae_. The distribution and variation of this species in  Colorado have been studied recently by Youngman (1958) who referred all  specimens from the Mesa Verde to _T. b. aureus_. He noted that some  specimens have dark diffuse dorsal stripes that are wide in specimens  from the Mancos River Valley. The generally darker color of the  specimens from the Mancos Valley as compared with that of specimens from  on the Mesa was noticed in the field, and is another example of the  local variability of pocket gophers. The nine specimens listed by  Youngman (1958:372) as from \"Mesa Verde National Park,\" Mancos River,  6200 ft., are not here listed among \"specimens examined\" because  possibly some, or all, of the nine were trapped on the east side of the  River and therefore outside the Park. None was, however, farther than 30  yards east of the Park.    In the Park, pocket gophers occur both on mesa tops and in canyons. Most  of the localities listed above and others at which mounds were seen are  areas of disturbance such as the old burn on Wetherill Mesa, the rights  of way for roads, the river valley, and the grazed floor of Prater  Canyon. Little evidence of pocket gophers was found on unusually rocky  slopes, steep slopes, or in stands of pinyon and juniper or in  relatively pure stands of oak-brush. In addition to workability of the  soil, the presence of herbaceous plants, many of them weedy annuals, is  probably the most important factor governing the success of pocket  gophers in a local area. No female was recorded to have contained  embryos, but two had enlarged uteri or placental scars. This fact and  the capture of nine half-grown individuals indicate breeding prior to  late August when most specimens were trapped.      Dipodomys ordii longipes (Merriam) Ord's Kangaroo Rat    Kangaroo rats have been seen crossing the highway in the Park less than  one mile from the Park entrance by Jean Pinkley.      Castor canadensis concisor Warren and Hall Beaver    In 1935 Quaintance and White spent June 16 to June 20 in the Mancos  River Bottoms at the mouth of Weber Canyon, looking for sign of fresh  beaver work. They found none. Annual Animal Census Reports include the  following information based on patrols along the Mancos River at the  east boundary of the Park: 1937--estimate 4 beaver present, 1938--8,  1941--numerous bank burrows, 1942--uncommon, 1944--uncommon, 1945--most  concentrated at southeast corner, 1946--runs and two small dams seen  (flood had washed out larger dams), 1947--only in 1-1/2 miles north of  boundary with Ute Reservation, 1949--two separate colonies (each with  dams and one with a large house), 1950--none, owing to drouth and  diversion of water upstream completely drying the river at times,  1951--none, 1953--present, 1955--present. On the Mancos River, 6200 ft.,  in late August, 1956, sign of beaver was abundant, numerous trees had  been cut but none within a week, and a bank den was found on the west  side of the river extending back 50 feet from the stream and caved in at  three places. In 1959 dens were still present.      Reithrodontomys megalotis aztecus J.A.

The specimen listed last (69325) was an adult male recovered from the  stomach of a small (snout-vent length 334 mm., wt. 26.0 gms.) _Crotalus  viridus_ that was trapped in a Museum Special mouse-trap on a rocky  slope mostly barren of vegetation. The availability of samples taken in  August (by Anderson in 1956), in September (by Shepherd in 1958), and in  November (by Alcorn in 1957) makes the following comparison of age and  reproductive condition possible. The sample from November includes some  specimens from outside the Park as follows: 1 mi. W Mancos, Colorado,  75979-75983, and 2 mi. N La Plata [not shown on Fig. 2], San Juan  County, New Mexico, some 18 miles southeast of the Park, 75987-76000.  The data shown in Figure 3 indicate that females are pregnant at least  from in August into November. A smaller percentage of females was  pregnant in November than in August or September. The fact that all  females more than 130 mm. long were pregnant in September suggests an  autumnal peak in breeding activity. A change in the ratio of small  individuals (less than 130 mm. in length) to large individuals (130 mm.  or more in length) is indicative of a sustained breeding period  throughout the time shown. In August the ratio was 1 to 2.3, in  September the ratio was 1 to 1.2, and the ratio was 1 to 0.7 in  November. The western harvest mouse is found usually in grassy areas.

Series of  specimens taken in August (by Anderson in 1956), in September (by  Shepherd in 1958 and 1959), and in November (by Alcorn in 1957) make  possible the following comparisons of age, reproductive conditions, and  molts.    The specimens obtained in August and November were placed in five  categories according to age (as judged by wear on the teeth). These  categories correspond in general to those used by Hoffmeister (1951:1)  in studies of _Peromyscus truei_. From his descriptions I judge that  wear in _Peromyscus maniculatus_ differs from wear in _Peromyscus truei_  in that the last upper molar is not worn smooth before appreciable wear  appears on the first two molars, and the lingual and labial cusps wear  more nearly concurrently. The five categories differ as follows:  category 1, last upper molar in process of erupting, showing no wear;  category 2, some wear apparent on all teeth, but most cusps little worn;  category 3, greater wear on all teeth, lingual cusps becoming rounded or  flattened; category 4, lingual cusps worn smooth, labial cusps show  considerable wear; category 5, all cusps worn smooth. The condition of  the pelage was noted for each prepared skin. Hoffmeister (_op. cit._: 4)  summarized changes in pelage that he observed in _Peromyscus truei_, and  he summarized earlier work by Collins with _Peromyscus maniculatus_. In  _P. maniculatus_ a grayish juvenal pelage is replaced by a postjuvenal  pelage in which the hairs are longer and have longer, pale, terminal or  subterminal bands giving a paler and more buffy or ochraceous hue to the  dorsal pelage. The postjuvenal pelage is replaced by an adult pelage  that is either brighter or, in some cases, is not distinguishable with  certainty from the postjuvenal pelage. Not only is the juvenal pelage  distinguishable from the postjuvenal pelage, but the sequence of  ingrowth of postjuvenal pelage follows a regular pattern that is usually  different from that of subsequent molts. The loss of juvenal hair is  less readily observed than the ingrowth of new postjuvenal hair on  account of the greater time required for the growth of any individual  hair than for the sudden loss of a hair.    Molt was observed in some individuals no longer having juvenal pelage;  some new pelage was observed on the skins of seven mice collected in  August. Each of these was in category 4 or 5 and probably had been born  in the previous calendar year. These seven molting individuals make up  nearly 17 per cent of 42 individuals that had completed the juvenal to  postjuvenal molt. In November, 80 per cent of individuals (92 of 115)  that had previously obtained their postjuvenal or adult pelage were  molting. These mice were in age-categories 3, 4, and 5. Some of the  individuals in category 3 were developing new hair beneath a relatively  unworn bright pelage that I judge to be an adult pelage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31050"],[0,"A New Order of Fishlike Amphibia From the Pennsylvanian of Kansas (#5)"],[1,"occipital condyle, as in Rhipidistia; nares separate from       rim of mouth; pectoral girdle anthracosaurian; vertebrae       having U-shaped intercentrum and paired, but large,       pleurocentra.    Probably associated with the characters of the order, as given above,  are the connection of pectoral girdle with skull, and the presence of a  tympanic membrane, the stapes functioning in both sound-transmission  and palatoquadrate suspension.         Family HESPEROHERPETONIDAE         Orbits and foramen magnum unusually large in correlation       with reduced size of animal; squamosal forming posterior       margin of orbit; circumorbital series absent (except for       postorbital); sensory pits on squamosal and frontal.    Characters defining the family are evidently the more specialized  cranial features, which probably evolved during Mississippian and early  Pennsylvanian times.    The definition of the genus and species may be left to rest upon  Peabody's (1958) original description and the present account, until  the discovery of other members of the family gives reason for making  further distinctions.      SUMMARY    _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody (1958), based on a  scapulocoracoid and part of a vertebra, was originally placed in the  order Anthracosauria, suborder Embolomeri, family Cricotidae. A new  skeleton from the type locality near Garnett, Kansas (Rock Lake shale,  Stanton formation, Upper Pennsylvanian), shows that the animal has the  following rhipidistian characters: Large notochordal canal below  foramen magnum, otico-occipital block separate from ethmosphenoid,  postaxial processes on three axial bones of forelimb, pectoral girdle  (probably) articulated with tabular. Nevertheless, _Hesperoherpeton_  has short digits, an anthracosaurian type of pectoral girdle, an otic  rather than spiracular notch, nostrils separate from the mouth, and  vertebrae in which the intercentrum is U-shaped and the pleurocentra  large but paired. The stapes reaches the quadrate.    _Hesperoherpeton_ is placed in a new order, PLESIOPODA, on the basis of  the characters stated above, and a new family, HESPEROHERPETONIDAE.  Specialized characters of the family include: Reduction of  circumorbital bones, bringing the squamosal to the edge of the orbit,  loss of certain bones of the temporal region, and relative enlargement  of the orbits and foramen magnum, in correlation with the diminutive  size of the animal. The structural characters of _Hesperoherpeton_  suggest to us that it lived in the shallow, weedy margins of lagoons,  rested with its head partly out of water, and normally did not walk on  land.
