On the 6th the enemy had made concentrated attacks at six  points: south of Albert, beyond the Vaire Wood, between Hailles and  Rouvrel, and on the Oise east of Chauny he gained ground, but his  attempt to take Mesnil beyond Montdidier and Mount Renaud beyond Noyon  were costly failures. On the 7th he attacked the British strategic  position at Eucquoy and the French position east of Chauny. At the  former place he was repulsed with heavy loss; at the latter his official  chronicler asserted that he gained ground.      ON THE LILLE FRONT    Then north of the great salient just occupied, the Germans struck, on  April 9, between the important British depots of Arras and Ypres, forty  miles apart, concentrating on a twelve-mile front between Givenchy and  Fleurbaix. During the two following days the concentration moved north  five miles, penetrating between Armentieres and Messines. On the 11th it  had developed as far north as Hollebeke, four miles southeast of Ypres,  had partly enveloped Messines Ridge and entirely Armentieres and the  town of Estaires on the Lys River. By the 12th it had swelled beyond  Merville and Lestrem in the south, was threatening the railway junction  of Bailleul in the middle ground, had gained a footing on Messines  Ridge, and was investing the neighboring heights of Neuve Eglise and  Kemmel in the north. By the morning of the 17th the German penetration  had reached Locon in the south, the Nieppe Forest in the middle ground,  and had occupied Bailleul and the eastern heights of the ridge in the  north and threatened the western and more elevated heights of Mont Rouge  and Mont Kemmel. Thus in eight days the Germans had developed a sector  on the Lille front of originally twenty-two miles, a salient embracing  an area of about 825 square miles with a new front of about thirty-five  miles.      SUMMARY OF THE FIGHTING    The initial bombardment which preceded the first infantry advance  against the Cambrai salient, at 8 o'clock on the morning of March 21,  was widely distributed--as far north as Ypres and as far south as the  Oise. It consisted mainly of gas and high explosive shells. The first  infantry attack, which penetrated the first and second lines on a  sixteen-mile front extending from Lagnicourt to Gauche Wood just south  of Gouseaucourt, caused a retreat from the salient which had been left  exposed to any superior attack since last December. In rapid succession  the British positions, now indefinitely exposed on the north, were then  attacked between Arras and La Fere, with tremendous concentration  between the latter and St. Quentin. According to the German report of  the 22d: \"After powerful fire by our artillery and mine throwers our  infantry stormed in broad sectors and everywhere captured the first  enemy line.\"    From the 22d until the 25th the Germans kept up a heavy fire upon the  French front, mingled with raids, both land and air, evidently with the  intention of preventing a movement of the French behind the lines as  long as the German intentions remained uncertain.    By the 24th, however, these intentions had been measurably revealed,  both by documents found on prisoners and by the general tendency of the  battle. On that day the enemy succeeded in crossing the Somme south of  Peronne, while north of it he forced the British to retire from the line  of the River Torille. On the same day Chauny and Ham were captured, the  British 3d and 4th Armies were pressed behind Peronne and Ham, and the  5th Army almost lost contact with the French. Here began that wonderful  feat which has made the name of General Carey famous. On the 25th the  enemy, by a series of drives en masse, managed to envelop Bapaume, while  south of Peronne he made still further progress, \"west of the Somme.\"    [Illustration: DETAIL MAP OF NORTHERN SECTOR OF BATTLE OF PICARDY, WHERE  HEAVY BLOWS WERE STRUCK BY THE GERMANS IN THEIR DRIVE TOWARD AMIENS AND  THE ENGLISH CHANNEL. THE FIGHTING WAS ESPECIALLY HEAVY AROUND PERONNE  AND ALBERT]    [Illustration: DETAIL MAP OF SOUTHERN PORTION OF BATTLEFIELD, SHOWING LA  FERE AND TERGNIER. WHERE GERMANS TRIED TO DRVE A WEDGE BETWEEN BRITISH  AND FRENCH ARMIES. THE BATTLE SWEPT WESTWARD PAST ROYE AND MONTDIDIER]    Nesle was lost and recovered several times by the French troops, who had  already begun to relieve certain portions of the British right, with its  unlucky 5th Army, as early as the 23d. In the engagements between  Bapaume and Peronne the German armies of von Below, who had just  returned from Italy, and von der Marwitz were personally directed by  Crown Prince Rupprecht, and outnumbered the British three to two.    [Illustration: DETAIL MAP OF THE STRUGGLE FOR ARRAS]      THE STRUGGLE FOR ALBERT    From the 25th to the 27th there was a lull in the north, evidently  conceived by the Germans for bringing their heavier guns up to new  emplacements, but in the south during this time the enemy heavily  concentrated against the new French troops that were appearing upon the  lengthening line and forced them to give up Lihons and Noyon. When the  German pressure was renewed in the north Albert became the obvious  objective, on account of the massed attacks made upon Ablainville near  by. In the battle of the Somme, Albert, as a junction and depot,  performed for the British in a minor degree what Cambrai later performed  for the Germans in the present battle. On March 27 the British began a  retreat on a wide front on both sides of the Somme, and in the evening  Albert was evacuated. The next day came the great French counterattack  between Lassigny and Noyon, already mentioned in connection with the  geographical development of the battle.    On the 28th the German attack was renewed on the Somme, where it pressed  back the British near the Chippily crossing, and before Arras, where a  frontal attack was repulsed with great enemy loss. This attack was  renewed for three successive days. Then on April 3 the French again won  near Lassigny and repulsed heavy German attacks around Moreuil.    [Illustration: DETAIL MAP OF FLANDERS SECTOR AND BATTLE AROUND  ARMENTIERES]    On April 4 a frightful battle developed, where on a narrow ten-mile  front, between Grivesnes, near the vertex of the Montdidier salient, and  the Roye-Amiens road, the Germans sacrificed thousands of men in a vain  attempt to drive a wedge between the newly discovered junction of the  French and British Armies.    From the 4th until the 7th, with the exception of the check the enemy  met with at Bucquoy on the latter date, he made a reconsolidation of his  lines, partially digging in on the sector before Amiens. The British  positions around Arras, to the north of the great salient, which had  again and again repelled frontal attacks, and the French positions on  the Montdidier salient and the Oise-Aisne watershed on the south, now  warned him of the danger of further progress west without augmented  protection of his flanks.

Y._  (_Press Illustrating Service_)]    Hence, on April 9, the reason for his sudden concentration and attack on  the Lille front, and particularly upon the junction of the British and  Portuguese lines near La Bassee Canal to a point east of Armentieres,  which is still in progress. The geographical as well as the strategic  features of this phase of the battle have already been described.  Complete success had marked the German efforts on this sector up to  April 17.    During the entire period covered the airplanes employed on the  battlefront were in the ratio of seven to five in favor of the Allies,  whose killings have been in the ratio of five to two. This, taken in  connection with the destruction of a great German plant and airdrome at  Friedrichshafen on April 15, is believed to place the dominance of the  air with all it includes as to observation and the bombing of transport  and arsenal in the hands of the Allies.          The British Reverses and Their Causes    By a Military Observer      Premier Lloyd George in his speech of April 9 [printed on Page 263]  compared the operations in Picardy with the battle of Cambrai. In fact,  the best way to understand what happened in the initial stage of the  great German drive is to remember the sequence of events in the German  attacks on the positions near Cambrai in 1917. At Cambrai there was a  mistaken confidence in the ability to hold the terrain, although German  attacks were expected. When these German assaults came, one was a  surprise, because there had been an unexpected concentration of German  troops; and this attack broke through the defense to such an extent that  it forced the abandonment of other positions, with losses of prisoners  and guns. All these tactical elements were present at the beginning of  the German drive in March, but on a much larger scale, because in this  case the German assaults were made on a front of some fifty miles.    The difficult problem for the Allies, in preparing to defend their long  front against the expected German offensive, was to provide against the  well-known German tactics of assembling superior numbers at the place of  battle.

At all events, a cup of coffee, and the  world was changed. Cordova! A midsummer heat, a land of vineyards and  olive groves, palms and aloes, a white, unearthly city, with narrow,  silent, deathlike streets, peopled only by drowsy beggars and by  gliding maskers that seemed more real than this Oriental picture in  which they moved, high walls with grated, harem-like windows, and an  occasional glimpse, through some arched doorway, into a  marble-floored, rose-waving, fountain-playing patio, enchanted and  mysterious, a dream within a dream. Cordova is more than haunted. It  is itself a ghost. The court of the Spanish caliphs, at once the Mecca  and the Athens of the West, a holy city which counted its baths and  mosques by hundreds, a seat of learning whose universities were  renowned for mathematics and philosophy, chemistry, astronomy, and  medicine, and within whose libraries were treasured manuscripts by  hundreds of thousands, a star of art and poetry, it ever reproaches,  by this lovely, empty shadow, the Christian barbarism that spurned  away the Moors.    The insulted Mosque of Cordova well-nigh makes Mohammedans of us all.  Entering by the studded Door of Pardon into the spacious Court of  Oranges, with its ancient trees and sparkling quintette of fountains,  one passes onward under the Arch of Blessings into a marble forest of  slender, sculptured pillars. The wide world, from Carthage to  Damascus, from Jerusalem to Ephesus and Rome, was searched for the  choicest shafts of jasper, breccia, alabaster, porphyry, until one  thousand four hundred precious columns bore the glory of rose-red  arches and wonder-roof of gilded and enamelled cedar. More than seven  thousand hanging lamps of bronze, filled with perfumed oil, flashed  out the mosaic tints,--golds, greens, violets, vermilions,--of  ceiling, walls, and pavement. All this shining sanctity culminated in  the Mihrab, or Prayer-Niche, an octagonal recess whose shell-shaped  ceiling is hollowed from a single block of pure white marble. This  Holy of Holies held the Koran, bound in gold and pearls, around  which the Faithful were wont to make seven turns upon their knees, an  act of devotion that has left indisputable grooves in the marble of  the pavement.      [Illustration: AN ARAB GATEWAY IN BURGOS]    The Christian conquerors splashed whitewash over the exquisite  ceiling, hewed down the pillars of the outer aisles to give space for  a fringe of garish chapels, and even chopped away threescore  glistening columns in the centre to make room for an incongruous  Renaissance choir, with an altar of silver gilt and a big pink  retablo. We could have wandered for endless hours among the strange  half-lights and colored shadows of that petrified faith of Islam,  marvelling on the processes of time. It is claimed that the Arab  mosque rose on the site of a Roman temple, whence Mahomet drove forth  Janus, to be in his own turn expelled by Christ. The race of those who  bowed themselves in this gleaming labyrinth has fared ill at Spanish  hands. Even now a Moor, however courteous and cultured, is refused  admission to certain Castilian churches, as the Escorial.    How did we ever part from Cordova, from her resplendent, desecrated  mosque, her stone lanes of streets, her hinted patios, the Moorish  mills and Roman bridge of her yellow Guadalquivir? It must all have  been a morning dream, for the early afternoon saw us tucked away in  another second-class carriage speeding toward Granada.    We were in beautiful Andalusia, _la tierra de Maria Santisima_. The  green slopes of the Sierra Morena, planted to the top with olive  groves, watched the beginnings of our journey, and banks of strange,  sweet flowers, with glimpses of Moorish minarets and groups of  dark-faced, bright-sashed peasants, looking as if they had just  stepped down from an artist's easel, beguiled us of all physical  discomforts save heat and thirst. When the sun was at its sorest, the  train drew up at a tumble-down station, and we looked eagerly for the  customary water seller, with his cry of \"Water! Fresh water! Water  cooler than snow!\" But it was too warm for this worthy to venture out,  and our hopes fastened on a picturesque old merchant seated in a shaft  of cypress shade beside a heap of golden oranges. Those juicy globes  were a sight to madden all the parched mouths in the train, and  imploring voices hailed the proprietor from window after window. But  our venerable hidalgo smoked his cigarette in tranquil ease,  disdaining the vulgarities of barter. At the very last moment we  persuaded a ragged boy in the throng of bystanders to fetch us a  hatful of the fruit. Then the peasant languidly arose, followed the  lad to our window, named an infinitesimal price, and received his coin  with the bow of a grandee. He was no hustler in business, this  Andalusian patriarch, but his dignity was epic and his oranges were  nectar.    We shall never know whether or not we had an adventure that evening. A  wild-eyed tatterdemalion swung himself suddenly into our compartment  and demanded our tickets, but as all the Andalusians looked to our  unaccustomed view like brigands, we did not discriminate against this  abrupt individual, but yielded up our strips of pasteboard without  demur. A swarthy young Moor of Tangier, the only other occupant of the  carriage, sharply refused to surrender his own until the intruder  should produce a conductor's badge, whereupon the stranger swore in  gypsy, or \"words to that effect,\" wrenched open the door and fled,  like Judas, into the outer dark. The Moor excitedly declared to us  that our tickets would be called for at the station in Granada, that  we should have to pay their price to the gate-keeper, and that our  irregular collector, hiding somewhere along the train, would be  admitted by that corrupt official to a share in the spoils. Moved by  our dismay, this son of the desert thrust his head through the window  at the next stop, and roared so lustily for the conductor and the  civil guard that, in a twinkling, the robber, if he was a robber,  popped up in the doorway again, like a Jack-in-the-box, and rudely  flung us back the tickets. Thereupon our benefactor, if he was a  benefactor, solemnly charged us never, on the Granada road, to give up  anything to anybody who wore no gilt on his cap.    More and more the purple mountains were folding us about, until at  last we arrived at Granada, too tired for a thrill. Mr. Gulick's  constant care, which had secured us harborage in Madrid, had provided  welcome here. Content in mere well-being, it was not until the  following afternoon that tourist enterprise revived within us. Then we  somewhat recklessly wandered down from the Alhambra hill into the  heart of the People's Carnival, a second Sunday of festival given over  to the enjoyment of the lower classes. The grotesque costumes were  coarser than ever and the fun was rougher. The maskers cracked whips  at the other promenaders, blew horns, shook rattles, and struck about  them with painted bladders, but the balconies were bright with the  bewitching looks of Andalusian beauties, each vying with the rest in  throwing the many-colored _serpentinas_, curly lengths of paper that  crisp themselves in gaudy fetters about their captives. A single  business house in Granada claimed to have sold over a million of  these, representing a value of some ten thousand dollars, during  Carnival week. Southern Spain was grumbling bitterly against the  Government and the war taxes, and in Seville, where a tax is put on  masks, the Carnival had been given up this year as last; but Granada  would not be cheated of her frolic. Our study of this closing phase of  the Carnival was cut short by the recollection that it was, above all,  the _fiesta_ of pickpockets. Finding ourselves, on the superb _Paseo  del Salon_, in the midst of a hooting, jostling, half-gypsy mob,  rained upon with _confetti_, called upon in broken French and English,  pressed upon by boys and beggars, and happening to catch sight of the  stately bronze statue of Columbus which the women of Granada had  recently stoned because, by discovering America, he brought all the  Cuban troubles upon Spain, we took the hint of the wise navigator's  eye and decided that we two stray Yankees might be as well off  somewhere else. \"Feet, why do I love you?\" say the Spaniards; and so  said we, suiting the action to the word.          III    WITHIN THE ALHAMBRA         \"The Sierra Nevada, an enormous dove which shelters under its       most spotless wings Saracen Granada.\"--ALARCON: _Los Seis       Velos_.      Our surprises were by no means over. We had come to Granada to bask in  the quintessence of earthly sunshine, and we found bleak rains, dark  skies, and influenza. The Moorish palace was indeed as wonderful as  our lifelong dream of it,--arched and columned halls of exquisite  fretwork, walls of arabesque where flushes and glints of color linger  yet, ceilings crusted with stalactite figures of tapering caprice, but  all too chill, even if the guides would cease from troubling, for  tarrying revery. We tarried, nevertheless, were enraptured, and caught  cold. We were dwelling in the village on the Alhambra hill, within the  circuit of the ruined fortress, in a villa kept by descendants of the  Moors, but the insolent grippe microbe respected neither ancient blood  nor republican. During the month of our residence, every member of the  household was brought low in turn, and there were days when even the  stubborn Yankees retreated to their pillows, lulled by the howling of  as wild March winds as ever whirled the grasshopper vane on Faneuil  Hall. From beyond the partition sounded the groans of our  fever-smitten hostess, and from the kitchen below arose the noise of  battle between our sturdy host and the rebel spoons and sauce-pans.
