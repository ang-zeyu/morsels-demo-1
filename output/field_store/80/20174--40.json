Trans._           *       *       *       *       *    The true Bee-eaters are confined to the old world, principally inhabiting  Africa and Asia; one species only, the European Bee-eater, being known with  any degree of certainty to be found in Europe; and this is occasionally  seen in England. They are all gregarious, feeding on the wing, and in  general migratory.    Most unwillingly I have again in this instance anticipated my friend Dr.  Horsfield in describing this bird, which he found in Java, and which I  engraved after one sent from Ceylon, without knowing it had also fallen  under his observation.    The figure is less than the natural size, which is nearly that of our  European species. Bill an inch and a half long from the gape, and black.  Nostrils small, basal, round, not sulcated, partially defended by incumbent  hairs; at the angle of the mouth is a row of short, stiff bristles; a black  line commences from the nostrils, passes under the eye, and terminates with  the ears. The upper part of the head, neck, and between the wings, rufous.  The rump and upper tail-covers pale blue: the chin and throat sulphur  tinged with rufous, where an irregular and narrow collar of black crosses  the neck. The remaining under parts yellowish-green. Wings and quills  fulvous green, the latter tipt with black, and all the inner shafts more or  less rufous: the second quill longest, and the lesser quills and  tail-feathers notched at their tips. Tail green, slightly forked; the tips  and under side dusky-black, and three inches and a half long. Wings, when  closed, four inches one line in length. Vent blueish-white.    The females in this genus may generally be distinguished by the two middle  tail-feathers being but slightly or not at all elongated.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 9    [Illustration]    HELIX auriculata.    _Eared Helix._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa orbicularis vel globosa. Spira depressa vel paululum elevata.      Apertura integra. Labium exterius marginatum. Operculum nullum._        Shell orbicular or globose. Spire depressed, or but slightly elevated.      Aperture entire. Outer lip margined. Operculum, none.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _H. testa depressissima, ferrugineo-marmorata et bifasciata, umbilico      magno, profundo, apertura auriformi; labio exteriore incrassato,      margine interiore dente obsoleto._        Shell much depressed, marbled and doubly-banded with ferrugineous.      Umbilicus large, deep. Aperture ear-shaped. Outer lip thickened,      reflected, with a gibbous obsolete tooth within.           *       *       *       *       *    A shell no less remarkable for its form than its extreme rarity. The mouth  bears a most striking resemblance to the human ear; and the only specimen  known in this country is the one here figured, from the cabinet of Ch.  Dubois, Esq., who obligingly favoured me with it for examination; neither  does the exquisite work on the Land Shells, by M. de Ferrusac, now  publishing at Paris, contain this species among the numerous matchless  figures already given of this family.    In the present uncertainty respecting the natural groups of the genus  _Helix_, as left by Lamarck, I have preferred for the present following the  example of Cuvier and de Ferrusac, in placing it with that family, in  preference to adopting the ill-defined and palpably artificial distribution  of them by D. de Montfort, or of forming a new genus for its reception.    The variegations in its colouring are better seen in the figures than  described. The whole shell is slightly marked with obsolete longitudinal  striae; the umbilicus is very deep, and the tooth does not extend  externally beyond the margin of the lip.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 10    [Illustration]    STROMBUS.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa ventricosa; basis canali brevi, truncato vel emarginato; labium      exterius simpliciter alatum, ala ad basin inferne emarginata; supra      dilatata._        _Animal marinum, carnivorum, trachelipodum; corpore spirali; pede      compresso ad cervicis basin inferiorem._ Leach in Zool.

Shell ventricose; base with a short canal, which is either emarginate      or truncate; external lip dilated into a simple wing, notched at the      base, and prominent above.

Outer lip smooth      within, deeply lobed above, attached to the second spiral volution.        _Lister_ 859. 15. _Chemnitz. tab._ 156. _fig._ 1491, 1492. _Rumph.      tab._ 36, P. _Gualtieri, tab._ 32, G.        Strombus marginatus. _Dillwyn's Cat._ p. 665. no. 18.           *       *       *       *       *    A pretty and diminutive species, scarcely ever more than one inch three  lines long. The spire long in proportion, and occupying half an inch: when  in perfection the colour is a deep chesnut, minutely broken into finely  serrated darker lines, with one, two, or three interrupted bands of white  on the body whorl, the spire, and margin of the outer lip paler; there are  two or three nodules above; and the spiral volutions have the carinated row  of tubercles usual in the _Strombi_, and are besides finely striated  transversely. The base of the shell is more deeply and distinctly striated;  both the lips are much thickened, tumid, white, and highly polished;  terminating above in obtuse points on the second spiral whorl, leaving a  narrow ascending channel between; the inside of the aperture is a fine  yellow.    Inhabits the Indian seas, but is not common.    By some unaccountable oversight, Mr. Dillwyn has very well described this  shell, but under the name and supposition of its being the _S. marginatus_  of Linnaeus; though a few pages after he brings all the true synonyms  referring to his shell, under a description purporting to be that of _S.  minimus_, but which in reality is more applicable to our next species. Why  this writer should doubt the correctness of Gmelin, Chemnitz, &c.  respecting the true _S. marginatus_ of Linnaeus, does not appear,  particularly as he has substituted for it a well known species. I have  little doubt myself they all mean one and the same shell, which is nothing  more than a scarce variety of _S. accinctus_, now before me, with which  Linnaeus's original description pretty well agrees.           *       *       *       *       *    STROMBUS variabilis.    _Variable Strombus--upper figure._        _S. testa nodose plicata, spira striis nullis; labio interiore      simplice, exteriore reflecto, intra laevi, supra leviter lobato._        Shell with nodulous plaits, the spire not striated. Inner lip simple.      Outer lip reflected, smooth within, and slightly lobed above.           *       *       *       *       *    Shell two inches and a quarter long, the spire occupying little more than  half an inch. The ground colour generally is white with numerous undulated  short lines of a darker colour, sometimes crossed by four or five obsolete  whitish bands: it approaches very near _S. minimus_, but is easily  distinguished by being in general much larger, by having the inner lip not  at all thickened above, the outer lip very slightly lobed, and only  advancing on the first volution of the spire: it varies, however, amazingly  in colour. There is a small variety, having a brown spot beneath, from  India; and others (labelled from the So. Seas) in the Banksian collection,  also small, are purplish-brown, with three or four well-defined bands of  white: the aperture is always pure white.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 11    [Illustration]    DRUSILLA Horsfieldii.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae mediocres, clava producta, gracili, cylindracea.

To return, however, to that now before us, it should be observed, that it  is the only species whose plumage does not in any way accord with that of  the rest of its brethren. No author appears to have described it, although  I met with it very frequently in Brazil: a specimen in the British Museum  has the ears reddish brown, but this seldom occurs. The figure is of the  size of life. All the species are natives of tropical America.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 83    [Illustration]    TROCHILUS falcatus,    _Sickle-winged Humming Bird._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 82.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _T. viridis, gula pectoreque nitide caeruleis; corpore anoque      caeruleo-viridibus; rectricibus paribus, rufo-cinnamominis; remigibus      exterioribus falcatis, scapis dilatato compressis._        Green; throat and breast shining blue; body and vent blue green; tail      even, rufous cinnamon; exterior quills falcated, the shafts dilated and      compressed.           *       *       *       *       *    Nothing can exceed the dazzling brilliancy of colours united in this little  creature. It is, however, more remarkable from the extraordinary  construction of its wings, the outer quills of which are greatly curved,  and the shafts dilated to a most disproportionate size; a similar structure  occurs also in the Broad-shafted H. B. of Dr. Shaw, (_T. latipennis_.) That  it is intended to fulfil some important office in their economy, will admit  of no doubt, for in wisdom are all things made; conjecture must, however,  in numberless instances, supply our want of real knowledge; and it may not  be improbable that such additional strength in the wings has been given  them as a defence against the small birds of prey, (_Lanii._ Lin.) which  abound in tropical countries.    The figure is the size of life; bill curved from the base, with a black  stripe between that and the eye; plumage above deep shining green, most  brilliant on the sides of the neck; ear feathers blue green; chin and  throat of a most brilliant deep violet blue, changing in some lights to  purple, becoming greenish on the breast, and blended with the green of the  neck; all these feathers are disposed like scales; vent golden green, with  two tufts of downy white feathers round the thighs. Tail even, the feathers  broad and truncately rounded, of a rufous cinnamon colour, tipt with a  purple black bar; the middle feathers darkest, and glossed with green.    Of this rare and unrecorded species, a fine example existed in Mr.  Bullock's Museum, which was purchased to enrich that of Paris: another,  more imperfect, was sent Mr. Falkner from the Spanish Main. The male of _T.  latipennis_ is undescribed, Dr. Shaw having only seen the female; both  sexes, however, are in my possession. The plant introduced in the plate  (_Clitoria Plumieri_) is a native of Brazil.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 84    [Illustration]    ACHATINA emarginata,    _Notched Achatina._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 30.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _A.

Gmelin remarks that the animal emits a phosphoric  light; and Captain Cook observed that it is oviparous, and discharged, on  being touched, a liquor of the most beautiful purple. Dr. Turton and Mr.  Dillwyn have recorded several British localities for this shell; and the  former notes having seen it alive, but without giving any original account  of the animal. The extreme brittleness of the shell is such, that, although  common, it is very rarely seen so perfect as here represented, from shells  in my own cabinet. All the figures I have seen are very defective.           *       *       *       *       *    IANTHINA globosa.    _Globular Oceanic Snail--middle figures._        _I. testa ventricosa, basi producta; apertura longiore quam latiore;      labio exteriore leviter emarginato._        Shell ventricose, the base lengthened; aperture longer than broad;      outer lip slightly emarginate.           *       *       *       *       *    The notch, which in _I. fragilis_ extends the whole length of the lip, in  this, is very slight, and nearly central. Mr. Dubois has enabled me to  figure it from specimens in the greatest perfection; it is much less common  than the last.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 86    [Illustration]    CONUS Princeps,    _Prince Cone._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. conicus, coronatus, roseus; lineis fusco-purpureis longitudinalibus      subramosis; spira convexa._--Lamarck.

They are likewise a very numerous  family, and, with three or four exceptions, are all inhabitants of tropical  latitudes, particularly the Indian Ocean. Bruguiere and Lamarck have each  written very able descriptions of the species, of which the latter  enumerates 179 recent, and 9 found only in a fossil state.    This is a shell of great rarity and beauty. Dead and injured specimens are  often seen, in which the deep reddish brown colour is bleached to a pale  rose, and the base worn round. Of the live shell I have never seen more  than two or three; and the finest of these is here figured from Mr. Dubois'  cabinet: it is a native of the Asiatic Ocean.    I see no reason why the original name of Linnaeus for this shell should  have been changed, although, under it, he has evidently included other  species quite distinct; (his var. [beta] being _C. ebraeus_): indeed, it  too often happens, that in making those alterations absolutely necessary in  the present state of the science, the spirit of innovation oversteps the  justice due to those,"]]]
