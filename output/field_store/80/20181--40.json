Punishment would be  given to the offender by the community. The bots, wers, and wites were  high and often could not be paid. If a man could not or would not pay,  he could be outlawed, to be killed by anyone with impunity or punished  by hanging; beheading; burning; drowning; stoning; precipitation from a  cliff; loss of ears, nose, upper-lip, hands and feet; castration;  flogging; or sale into slavery.            There were occasional meetings of \"hundreds\", which were 100  households, to settle widespread disputes. The chief officer was  \"hundreder\" or \"constable\". He was responsible for keeping the peace of  the hundred.            The concept of a wrong to a person or his kindred is still  primary and that of offense to the community secondary. Very slowly did  the concept emerge that that members of the community must be content  with legal remedies and must not seek private vengeance and that public  offenses cannot be altered by private agreement.            The Druid priests decided all disputes of the Celts.                           Chapter 2                     The Times: 600-900            The country was inhabited by Anglo-Saxons. The French called it  \"Angleterre\", which means the angle or end of the earth. It was called  \"Angle land\", which later became \"England\".            A community was usually an extended family. Its members lived a  village in which a stone church was the most prominent building. They  lived in one-room huts with walls and roofs made of wood, mud, and  straw. Hangings covered the cracks in the walls to keep the wind out.  Smoke from a fire in the middle of the room filtered out of cracks in  the roof. Grain was ground at home by rotating by hand one stone disk  on another stone disk. Some villages had a mill powered by the flow of  water or by horses. All freeholders had the duty of watch [at night]  and ward [during the day], of following the hue and cry to chase an  offender, and of taking the oath of peace. These three duties were  constant until 1195.            Farmland surrounded the villages and was farmed by the  community as a whole under the direction of a lord. There was silver,  copper, iron, tin, gold, and various types of stones from remote lead  mines and quarries in the nation. Silver pennies replaced the smaller  scaetts. Freemen paid \"scot\" and bore \"lot\" according to their means  for local purposes.            Offa, the strongest of the Saxon kings, minted high-quality  silver pennies. He traded woolen coats for lava grindstones with  Emperor Charlemagne, who used a silver denarius coin. There were 12  denarii to the solidus and 20 soldi to the pound of silver. These  denominations were taken by England as 12 pennies to the shilling and  20 shillings to the pound. The pound sign, an \"L\" with a hash mark  derived from the word Libra, which meant weighing scales.            Everyone in the village went to church on Sunday and brought  gifts such as grain to the priest. Later, contributions in the form of  money became customary, and then expected. These \"tithes\" were spent  for church repair, the clergy, and poor and needy laborers. The church  fixed the amount to be one-tenth, but local custom determined the  amount. There was also church-scot: a payment to the clergy in lieu of  the first fruits of the land. There were also offerings, originally  voluntary but afterwards compulsory, for sacraments. The priest was the  chaplain of a landlord and his parish was coextensive with that  landlord's holding and could include one to several villages. The  priest and other men who helped him, lived in the church building. Some  churches had lead roofs and iron hinges, latches, and locks on their  doors. The land underneath had been given to the church by former kings  and persons who wanted the church to say prayers to help their souls go  from purgatory to heaven and who also selected the first priest. The  priest conducted Christianized Easter ceremonies in the spring and  (Christ's mass) ceremonies in winter in place of the pagan Yuletide  festivities. Burning incense took the place of pagan burnt animal  offerings, which were accompanied by incense to disguise the odor of  burning flesh. Holy water replaced haunted wells and streams. Christian  incantations replaced sorcerer's spells. Nuns assisted priests in  celebrating mass and administering the sacraments. They alone  consecrated new nuns. Vestry meetings were community meetings held for  church purposes. The people said their prayers in English, and the  priest conducted the services in English. A person joined his hands in  prayer as if to offer them for binding together in submission.            The church baptized babies and officiated or gave blessings at  marriage ceremonies. It also said prayers for the dying, gave them  funerals, and buried them. There were burial service fees, candle dues,  and plough alms. A piece of stone with the dead person's name marked  his grave. It was thought that putting the name on the grave would  assist identification of that person for being taken to heaven. The  church heard the last wish or will of the person dying concerning who  he wanted to have his property. The church taught that it was not  necessary to bury possessions with the deceased. The church taught boys  and girls.            Every man carried a horn slung on his shoulder as he went about  his work so that he could at once send out a warning to his fellow  villagers or call them in chasing a thief or other offender. The  forests were full of outlaws, so strangers who did not blow a horn to  announce themselves were presumed to be fugitive offenders who could be  shot on sight with impunity. An eorl could call upon the ceorl farmers  for about forty days to fight off an invading group.            There were several kingdoms, whose boundaries kept changing due  to warfare, which was a sin according to the church. They were each  governed by a king and witan of wise men who met at a witanegemot,  which was usually held three times a year, mostly on great church  festivals and at the end of the harvest. The king and witan chose the  witan's members of bishops, eorldormen, and thegns [landholding  farmers]. The king and hereditary claims played a major part in the  selection of the eorldormen, who were the highest military leaders and  often of the royal family. They were also chief magistrates of large  jurisdictional areas of land. The witan included officers of the king's  household and perhaps other of his retinue. There was little  distinction then between his gesith, fighting men, guards, household  companions, dependents, and servants. The king was sometimes  accompanied by his wife and sons at the witanagemot. A king was  selected by the witan according to his worthiness, usually from among  the royal family, and could be deposed by it. The witan and king  decided on laws, taxes, and transfers of land. They made determinations  of war and peace and directed the army and the fleet. The king wore a  crown or royal helmet. He extended certain protections by the king's  peace. He could erect castles and bridges and could provide a special  protection to strangers.            A king had not only a wergeld to be paid to his family if he  were killed, but a \"cynebot\" of equal amount that would be paid to his  kingdom's people. A king's household had a chamberlain for the royal  bedchamber, a marshall to oversee the horses and military equipment, a  steward as head of household, and a cupbearer. The king had income from  fines for breach of his peace; fines and forfeitures from courts  dealing with criminal and civil cases; salvage from ship wrecks;  treasure trove [assets hidden or buried in times of war]; treasures of  the earth such as gold and silver; mines; saltworks; tolls and other  dues of markets, ports, and the routes by land and by river generally;  heriot from heirs of his special dependents for possession of land  (usually in kind, principally in horses and weapons). He also had  rights of purveyance [hospitality and maintenance when traveling]. The  king had private lands, which he could dispose of by his will. He also  had crown lands, which belonged to his office and could not be  alienated without consent of the witan. Crown lands often included  palaces and their appendant farms, and burhs. It was a queen's duty to  run the royal estate. Also, a queen could possess, manage, and dispose  of lands in her name. Violent queens waged wars. Kingdoms were often  allied by marriage between their royal families. There were also royal  marriages to royalty on the continent.            The houses of the wealthy had ornamented silk hangings on the  walls. Some had fine white ox horn shaved so thin they were transparent  for windows. Brightly colored drapery, often purple, and fly nets  surrounded their beds, which were covered with the fur of animals. They  slept in bed clothes on pillows stuffed with straw. Tables plated with  silver and gems held silver candlesticks, gold and silver goblets and  cups, and lamps of gold, silver, or glass. They used silver mirrors and  silver writing pens. There were covered seats, benches, and footstools  with the head and feet of animals at their extremities. They ate from a  table covered with a cloth. Servants brought in food on spits, from  which they ate.

With respect  to Jonson's use of his material, Dryden said memorably of him:  \"[He] was not only a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned  plagiary of all the others; you track him everywhere in their  snow....But he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he  fears not to be taxed by any law.  He invades authors like a  monarch, and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in  him.\"  And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided himself,  and justly, on his originality.  In \"Catiline,\" he not only uses  Sallust's account of the conspiracy, but he models some of the  speeches of Cicero on the Roman orator's actual words.  In  \"Poetaster,\" he lifts a whole satire out of Horace and dramatises  it effectively for his purposes.  The sophist Libanius suggests the  situation of \"The Silent Woman\"; a Latin comedy of Giordano Bruno,  \"Il Candelaio,\" the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in \"The  Alchemist,\" the \"Mostellaria\" of Plautus, its admirable opening  scene.  But Jonson commonly bettered his sources, and putting the  stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it  thenceforward to all time current and his own.    The lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a  peculiar merit.  His theory demanded design and the perfection of  literary finish. He was furthest from the rhapsodist and the  careless singer of an idle day; and he believed that Apollo could  only be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned.  And  yet many of Jonson's lyrics will live as long as the language.  Who  does not know \"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair.\"  \"Drink to me  only with thine eyes,\" or \"Still to be neat, still to be dressed\"?  Beautiful in form, deft and graceful in expression, with not a word  too much or one that bears not its part in the total effect, there  is yet about the lyrics of Jonson a certain stiffness and  formality, a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous  and unbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak, with  disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual  thought is on greater things.  It is for these reasons that Jonson  is even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where  rhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the  spontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical  poetry.  There are no such epitaphs as Ben Jonson's, witness the  charming ones on his own children, on Salathiel Pavy, the  child-actor, and many more; and this even though the rigid law of  mine and thine must now restore to William Browne of Tavistock the  famous lines beginning: \"Underneath this sable hearse.\"  Jonson is  unsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment, seldom  falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet  showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others,  a discriminating taste and a generous personal regard.  There was  no man in England of his rank so well known and universally beloved  as Ben Jonson.  The list of his friends, of those to whom he had  written verses, and those who had written verses to him, includes  the name of every man of prominence in the England of King James.  And the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate  familiarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth  of the laureate.  In 1619, growing unwieldy through inactivity,  Jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to Scotland.  On his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the  houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had  recommended him.  When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met  to grant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of  Scottish poets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest  at Hawthornden.  Some of the noblest of Jonson's poems were  inspired by friendship.  Such is the fine \"Ode to the memory of Sir  Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Moryson,\" and that admirable piece of  critical insight and filial affection, prefixed to the first  Shakespeare folio, \"To the memory of my beloved master, William  Shakespeare, and what he hath left us,\" to mention only these.  Nor  can the earlier \"Epode,\" beginning \"Not to know vice at all,\" be  matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and  stately age.    But if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his  folio and up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from  inactive; for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness  continued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court.  In \"The Golden Age Restored,\" Pallas turns the Iron Age with  its attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight; in  \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" Atlas figures represented as an  old man, his shoulders covered with snow, and Comus, \"the god of  cheer or the belly,\" is one of the characters, a circumstance which  an imaginative boy of ten, named John Milton, was not to forget.  \"Pan's Anniversary,\" late in the reign of James, proclaimed that  Jonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite lyrics, and  \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" displayed the old drollery and broad  humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable.  These, too, and  the earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo Room of  the Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of  English literary Bohemia.  We hear of a room blazoned about with  Jonson's own judicious \"Leges Convivales\" in letters of gold, of a  company made up of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly  attached to their veteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions,  affections, and enmities.  And we hear, too, of valorous potations;  but in the words of Herrick addressed to his master, Jonson, at the  Devil Tavern, as at the Dog, the Triple Tun, and at the Mermaid,         \"We such clusters had       As made us nobly wild, not mad,       And yet each verse of thine       Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\"    But the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,  though Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet  returned to the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, \"The  Staple of News,\" \"The New Inn,\" \"The Magnetic Lady,\" and \"The Tale  of a Tub,\" the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy.  None of these plays met with any marked success, although the  scathing generalisation of Dryden that designated them \"Jonson's  dotages\" is unfair to their genuine merits.  Thus the idea of an  office for the gathering, proper dressing, and promulgation of news  (wild flight of the fancy in its time) was an excellent subject for  satire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers; although  as much can hardly be said for \"The Magnetic Lady,\" who, in her  bounty, draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile  them in the end according to the alternative title, or \"Humours  Reconciled.\"  These last plays of the old dramatist revert to  caricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more  than ever present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon,  especially of his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears  unworthily to have used his influence at court against the  broken-down old poet.  And now disease claimed Jonson, and he was  bedridden for months.  He had succeeded Middleton in 1628 as  Chronologer to the City of London, but lost the post for not  fulfilling its duties.  King Charles befriended him, and even  commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;  and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and  devoted friends among the younger poets who were proud to be  \"sealed of the tribe of Ben.\"    Jonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which  he had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in  its various parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642.  It included all  the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, excepting \"The  Case is Altered;\" the masques, some fifteen, that date between 1617  and 1630; another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called  \"Underwoods,\" including some further entertainments; a translation  of \"Horace's Art of Poetry\" (also published in a vicesimo quarto in  1640), and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would  hardly have included himself.  These last comprise the fragment  (less than seventy lines) of a tragedy called \"Mortimer his Fall,\"  and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty and poetic  spirit, \"The Sad Shepherd.\"  There is also the exceedingly  interesting \"English Grammar\" \"made by Ben Jonson for the benefit  of all strangers out of his observation of the English language now  spoken and in use,\" in Latin and English; and \"Timber, or  Discoveries\" \"made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of  his daily reading, or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of  the times.\"  The \"Discoveries,\" as it is usually called, is a  commonplace book such as many literary men have kept, in which  their reading was chronicled, passages that took their fancy  translated or transcribed, and their passing opinions noted.  Many  passages of Jonson's \"Discoveries\" are literal translations from the  authors he chanced to be reading, with the reference, noted or not,  as the accident of the moment prescribed.  At times he follows the  line of Macchiavelli's argument as to the nature and conduct of  princes; at others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and  poets by recourse to Aristotle.  He finds a choice paragraph on  eloquence in Seneca the elder and applies it to his own  recollection of Bacon's power as an orator; and another "]]]
