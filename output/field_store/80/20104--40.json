But if he tells the young men to go fighting, I  shall come with a much stronger god, who will eat your god up. The  palaver is finished.\"    Sanders, with his feet stretched out on the rail of the boat, thought of  the new god idly. When was it that the last had come? There was one in  the N'Gombi country years ago, a sad god who lived in a hut which no man  dare approach; there was another god who came with thunder demanding  sacrifice--human sacrifice. This was an exceptionally bad god, and had  cost the British Government six hundred thousand pounds, because there  was fighting in the bush and a country unsettled. But, in the main, the  gods were good, doing harm to none, for it is customary for new gods to  make their appearance after the crops are gathered, and before the rainy  season sets in.    So Sanders thought, sitting in the shade of a striped awning on the  foredeck of the little _Zaire_.    The next day, before the sun came up, he turned the nose of the steamer  up-stream, being curious as to the welfare of the shy Ochori folk, who  lived too near the Akasava for comfort, and, moreover, needed nursing.  Very slow was the tiny steamer's progress, for the current was strong  against her. After two days' travel Sanders got into Lukati, where young  Carter had a station.    The deputy commissioner came down to the beach in his pyjamas, with a  big pith helmet on the back of his head, and greeted his chief  boisterously.    \"Well?\" said Sanders; and Carter told him all the news. There was a land  palaver at Ebibi; Otabo, of Bofabi, had died of the sickness; there were  two leopards worrying the outlying villages, and----    \"Heard about the Isisi god?\" he asked suddenly; and Sanders said that he  had.    \"It's an old friend of yours,\" said Carter. \"My people tell me that this  old god-box contains the stone of the Ochori.\"    \"Oh!\" said Sanders, with sudden interest.    He breakfasted with his subordinate, inspected his little garrison of  thirty, visited his farm, admired his sweet potatoes, and patronised his  tomatoes.    Then he went back to the boat and wrote a short dispatch in the tiniest  of handwriting on the flimsiest of paper slips. \"In case!\" said Sanders.    \"Bring me 14,\" he said to his servant, and Abiboo came back to him soon  with a pigeon in his hand.    \"Now, little bird,\" said Sanders, carefully rolling his letter round the  red leg of the tiny courier and fastening it with a rubber band, \"you've  got two hundred miles to fly before sunrise to-morrow--and 'ware hawks!\"    Then he gathered the pigeon in his hand, walked with it to the stern of  the boat, and threw it into the air.    His crew of twelve men were sitting about their cooking-pot--that pot  which everlastingly boils.    \"Yoka!\" he called, and his half-naked engineer came bounding down the  slope.    \"Steam,\" said Sanders; \"get your wood aboard; I am for Isisi.\"           *     *     *     *     *    There was no doubt at all that this new god was an extremely powerful  one. Three hours from the city the _Zaire_ came up to a long canoe with  four men standing at their paddles singing dolefully. Sanders remembered  that he had passed a village where women, their bodies decked with green  leaves, wailed by the river's edge.    He slowed down till he came abreast of the canoe, and saw a dead man  lying stark in the bottom.    \"Where go you with this body?\" he asked.    \"To Isisi, lord,\" was the answer.    \"The middle river and the little islands are places for the dead,\" said  Sanders brusquely. \"It is folly to take the dead to the living.\"    \"Lord,\" said the man who spoke, \"at Isisi lives a god who breathes life;  this man\"--he pointed downwards--\"is my brother, and he died very  suddenly because of a leopard. So quickly he died that he could not tell  us where he had hidden his rods and his salt. Therefore we take him to  Isisi, that the new god may give him just enough life to make his  relations comfortable.\"    \"The middle river,\" said Sanders quietly, and pointed to such a lone  island, all green with tangled vegetation, as might make a burying  ground. \"What is your name?\"    \"Master, my name is N'Kema,\" said the man sullenly.    \"Go, then, N'Kema,\" he said, and kept the steamer slow ahead whilst he  watched the canoe turn its blunt nose to the island and disembark its  cargo.    Then he rang the engines full ahead, steered clear of a sandbank, and  regained the fairway.    He was genuinely concerned.    The stone was something exceptional in fetishes, needing delicate  handling. That the stone existed, he knew. There were legends  innumerable about it; and an explorer had, in the early days, seen it  through his glasses. Also the \"ghosts clad in brass\" he had heard  about--these fantastic and warlike shades who made peaceable men go out  to battle--all except the Ochori, who were never warlike, and whom no  number of ghosts could incite to deeds of violence.    You will have remarked that Sanders took native people seriously, and  that, I remark in passing, is the secret of good government. To him,  ghosts were factors, and fetishes potent possibilities. A man who knew  less would have been amused, but Sanders was not amused, because he had  a great responsibility. He arrived at the city of Isisi in the  afternoon, and observed, even at a distance, that something unusual was  occurring. The crowd of women and children that the arrival of the  Commissioner usually attracted did not gather as he swung in from  mid-stream and followed the water-path that leads to shoal.    Only the king and a handful of old men awaited him, and the king was  nervous and in trouble.    \"Lord,\" he blurted, \"I am no king in this city because of the new god;  the people are assembled on the far side of the hill, and there they sit  night and day watching the god in the box.\"    Sanders bit his lip thoughtfully, and said nothing.    \"Last night,\" said the king, \"'The Keepers of the Stone' appeared  walking through the village.\"    He shivered, and the sweat stood in big beads on his forehead, for a  ghost is a terrible thing.    \"All this talk of keepers of stones is folly,\" said Sanders calmly;  \"they have been seen by your women and your unblooded boys.\"    \"Lord, I saw them myself,\" said the king simply; and Sanders was  staggered, for the king was a sane man.    \"The devil you have!\" said Sanders in English; then, \"What manner of  ghost were these?\"    \"Lord,\" said the king, \"they were white of face, like your greatness.  They wore brass upon their heads and brass upon their breasts. Their  legs were bare, but upon the lower legs was brass again.\"    \"Any kind of ghost is hard enough to believe,\" said Sanders irritably,  \"but a brass ghost I will not have at any price.\" He spoke English  again, as was his practice when he talked to himself, and the king  stood silent, not understanding him.    \"What else?\" said Sanders.    \"They had swords,\" continued the chief, \"such as the elephant-hunters of  the N'Gombi people carry. Broad and short, and on their arms were  shields.\"    Sanders was nonplussed.    \"And they cry 'war,'\" said the chief. \"This is the greatest shame of  all, for my young men dance the death dance and streak their bodies with  paint and talk boastfully.\"    \"Go to your hut,\" said Sanders; \"presently I will come and join you.\"    He thought and thought, smoking one black cigar after another, then he  sent for Abiboo, his servant.    \"Abiboo,\" he said, \"by my way of thinking, I have been a good master to  you.\"    \"That is so, lord,\" said Abiboo.    \"Now I will trust you to go amongst my crew discovering their gods. If I  ask them myself, they will lie to me out of politeness, inventing this  god and that, thinking they please me.\"    Abiboo chose the meal hour, when the sun had gone out and the world was  grey and the trees motionless. He came back with the information as  Sanders was drinking his second cup of coffee in the loneliness of the  tiny deck-house.    \"Master,\" he reported, \"three men worship no god whatever, three more  have especial family fetishes, and two are Christians more or less, and  the four Houssas are with me in faith.\"    \"And you?\"    Abiboo, the Kano boy, smiled at Sanders' assumption of innocence.    \"Lord,\" he said, \"I follow the Prophet, believing only in the one God,  beneficent and merciful.\"    \"That is good,\" said Sanders. \"Now let the men load wood, and Yoka shall  have steam against moonrise, and all shall be ready for slipping.\"    At ten o'clock by his watch he fell-in his four Houssas, serving out to  each a short carbine and a bandoleer. Then the party went ashore.    The king in his patience sat in his hut, and Sanders found him.    \"You will stay here, Milini,\" he commanded, \"and no blame shall come to  you for anything that may happen this night.\"    \"What will happen, master?\"    \"Who knows!\" said Sanders, philosophically.    The streets were in pitch darkness, but Abiboo, carrying a lantern, led  the way. Only occasionally did the party pass a tenanted hut. Generally  they saw by the dull glow of the log that smouldered in every habitation  that it was empty. Once a sick woman called to them in passing. It was  near her time, she said, and there was none to help her in the supreme  moment of her agony.    \"God help you, sister!\" said Sanders, ever in awe of the mysteries of  birth. \"I will send women to you. What is your name?\"    \"They will not come,\" said the plaintive voice. \"To-night the men go out  to war, and the women wait for the great dance.\"    \"To-night?\"    \"To-night, master--so the ghosts of brass decree.\"    Sanders made a clicking noise with his mouth.    \"That we shall see,\" he said, and went on.    The party reached the outskirts of the city. Before them, outlined  against a bronze sky, was the dark bulk of a little hill, and this they  skirted.    The bronze became red, and rose, and dull bronze again, as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#5)"],[1,"d, finally, trace him executing the Lord's vengeance and anger  against Uz, upon the kings of the Philistines, and Askelon, Azaah;  Ekrom, Edom, Moab, Ammon; Dedan, Tema, and Buz; and upon the kings of  Arabia, Zimri and Elam; and upon all the kings of the Medes; and upon  all the kings of the north, far and near; and finally upon all the  kingdoms of the world, who were to be drunken, and spew, and fall to  rise no more, because of the sword which He would send among them.  But, when the Lord had accomplished all his mind on these nations, He  purposed, in turn, to punish this great monarch, and those who  succeeded him; and also the city and nation over which he reigned; and  finally to make it perpetual desolations. And all this for their pride  and haughtiness. The Lord exclaims: \"Shall the ax boast itself against  him that heweth therewith, or shall the saw boast itself against him  that shaketh it?\" etc. But, in order to trace the events of the return  of the Jews, and the other nations, from their seventy years'  captivity and bondage, and the punishment of Babylon, another and very  different character from that of Nebuchadnezzar is introduced by the  Prophets--one who is in Scripture termed the Lord's anointed. He may  be considered one of the most extraordinary characters that ever the  heathen world produced: his mildness, courage, perseverance, success,  and, above all, his strict obedience to the command of _that_ God  which neither he nor his fathers had known, all go to prove that  Isaiah was not mistaken when he called him by name, as the Lord's  anointed, to deliver the nations from bondage, to scourge and subdue  the greatest city and monarchy that have at any time existed on the  earth, and to restore the Jews, and rebuild their city and temple.  Indeed, he was one of those few whom the world never produces except  for extraordinary purposes. But let us hear the Prophet's own  description of him, Isaiah, chapter xlv: \"Thus saith the Lord to his  anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations  before him: and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him  the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut. I will go  before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in  pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron. And I  will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret  places, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy  name, am the God of Israel. For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel  mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee,  though thou hast not known me. I am the Lord, and there is none else,  there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known  me: that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,  that there is none besides me.\" In the 13th verse, he says: \"I have  raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he  shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price  nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts.\" The reader will bear in mind  that Isaiah lived about one hundred years before the Jewish captivity,  and one hundred and seventy years before Cyrus caused their return.    Here I would pause and inquire, What power but the power of the great  God could enable one man to call another by name, a century before his  birth, and also to foretell correctly the history of his life? What  must have been his wonder and astonishment, when, after many years of  wars and commotions, during which he marched forth, conquering and to  conquer, gathering as a nest the riches of the nations, he at last  pitched his camp near the walls of the strongest hold in all the  earth? He gazed upon its walls of upwards of three hundred feet in  height, with its gates of brass and its bars of iron: the people  within feeling perfectly safe, with provisions enough to last the  inhabitants of the city for several years. How could he think of  taking that city? Who would not have shrunk from such an undertaking,  unless inspired by the great Jehovah? But, turning the river Euphrates  from its course, and marching under the walls of the city, in the  dried bed of the river, he found himself in possession of the city,  without any difficulty; for Belshazzar, the king, was drinking himself  drunk, with his nobles and concubines, and that, too, from the vessels  of the House of the Lord which his father had taken from Jerusalem,  and his knees had already smote together with horror, from the  handwriting on the wall, which Daniel had just been called in to  interpret, giving his kingdom to the Medes and Persians. Having  subdued this great monarchy, he seated himself upon the throne of  kingdoms; and, becoming familiar with Daniel, he was, no doubt,  introduced to an acquaintance with the Jewish records, and then the  mystery was unfolded: he could then see that God had called him by  name, that the Almighty hand girded him for the battle, and directed  all his work; he could then understand why the treasures of the earth  poured themselves into his bosom, and why the loins of kings had been  unloosed before him, and why the gates of brass had been opened, and  the bars of iron burst asunder. It was that he might know that there  was a God in Israel, and none else, and that all idols were as  nothing; that he might also restore the Jews, and rebuild their city  and temple, and fulfil God's purposes upon Babylon. He accordingly  issued his proclamation to the Jews to return, and for the nations to  assist them in rebuilding, \"for,\" said he, \"God hath commanded me to  build him an house at Jerusalem.\" Ezra, chapter i, 2, 3, says: \"Thus  saith Cyrus, king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all  the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an  house at Jerusalem, which is in Judea. Who is there among you of all  his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which  is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, he is the  God which is in Jerusalem.\"    What powerful argument, what mighty influence was it which caused  Cyrus to be convinced that it was the God of heaven who dwelt at  Jerusalem, who alone was God, and who had done all these things? He  had not been traditioned in the belief of the true God, nor of the  holy Scriptures. Nay, he had ever been very zealous in the worship of  idols; it was to idols he looked for assistance in the former part of  his life. I reply, it was the power of God, made manifest by prophecy  and its fulfilment; not in a spiritualized sense, not in some obscure,  uncertain, or dark, mysterious way, which was difficult to be  understood; but in positive, literal, plain demonstration, which none  could gainsay or resist. Isaiah says that this was the object the Lord  had in view when he revealed such plainness. And Cyrus manifested that  it had the desired effect.    I would here remark that when we come to treat of that part of  prophecy which yet remains to be fulfilled, we shall bring proof  positive that the heathen nations of the latter days are to be  convinced in the same way that Cyrus was; that is, there are certain  events plainly predicted in the Prophets, yet future, which, when  fulfilled, will convince all the heathen nations of the true God, and  they shall know that he hath spoken and performed it. And all the  great and learned men of Christendom, and all societies, who put any  other than a _literal_ construction on the word of prophecy, shall  stand confounded, and be constrained to acknowledge that all has come  to pass even as it is written.    But to return to our research of prophecy and its fulfilment. The  Prophets had not only predicted the reduction of Babylon by Cyrus, but  they had denounced its fate through all ages, until reduced to entire  desolation, never to be inhabited, not even as a temporary residence  for the wandering Arab: \"And the Arabian shall not pitch tent there.\"  See Isaiah, xiii, 19-22.    Mr. Joseph Wolfe, the celebrated Jewish missionary, while traveling in  Chaldea, inquired of the Arabs whether they pitched their tents among  the ruins of Babylon, to which they replied in the negative, declaring  their fears that, should they do so, Nimrod's ghost would haunt them.  Thus all the predictions of the Prophets concerning that mighty city  have been fulfilled.    Edom also presents a striking fulfilment of plain and pointed  predictions in the Prophets. These predictions were pronounced upon  Edom at a time when its soil was very productive and well cultivated,  and everywhere abounding in flourishing towns and cities. But now its  cities have become heaps of desolate ruins, only inhabited by the  cormorant, bittern, and by wild beasts, serpents, etc., and its soil  has become barren; the Lord has cast upon it the line of confusion,  and the stones of emptiness, and it has been waste from generation to  generation, in express fulfilment of the word of prophecy.    We will now give a passing notice of the vision of Daniel, recorded in  the eighth chapter of his prophecies, concerning the ram and the goat.  The reader would do well to turn and read the whole chapter; but we  will more particularly notice the interpretation, as it was given him  by Gabriel, recorded from the nineteenth to the twenty-fifth verses.  And he said: \"I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of  the indignation, for at the time appointed the end shall be. The ram  which thou sawest having two horns, are the kings of Media and Persia:  and the rough goat is the king of Grecia; and the great horn that is  between the eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas  four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation,  but not in his power. And in the latter time of their kingdom, when  the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance,  and understanding dark"]]]
