As no appearance of a change in our favour seemed likely to take  place, Governor Phillip at this time signified his intention of shifting  his pennant from the Sirius to the 'Supply', and proceeding on his  voyage without waiting for the rest of the fleet, which was formed in  two divisions. The first consisting of three transports, known to be the  best sailors, was put under the command of a Lieutenant of the navy;  and the remaining three, with the victuallers, left in charge of Captain  Hunter, of his Majesty's ship Sirius. In the last division was the  vessel, in which the author of this narrative served. Various causes  prevented the separation from taking place until the 25th, when several  sawyers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and other mechanics, were shifted  from different ships into the 'Supply', in order to facilitate his  Excellency's intention of forwarding the necessary buildings to be  erected at Botany Bay, by the time the rest of the fleet might be  expected to arrive. Lieutenant Governor Ross, and the Staff of the  marine battalion, also removed from the Sirius into the Scarborough  transport, one of the ships of the first division, in order to afford  every assistance which the public service might receive, by their being  early on the spot on which our future operations were to be conducted.    From this time a succession of fair winds and pleasant weather  corresponded to our eager desires, and on the 7th of January, 1788, the  long wished for shore of Van Diemen gratified our sight. We made the  land at two o'clock in the afternoon, the very hour we expected to see  it from the lunar observations of Captain Hunter, whose accuracy, as  an astronomer, and conduct as an officer, had inspired us with equal  gratitude and admiration.    After so long a confinement, on a service so peculiarly disgusting and  troublesome, it cannot be matter of surprise that we were overjoyed at  the near prospect of a change of scene. By sunset we had passed between  the rocks, which Captain Furneaux named the Mewstone and Swilly.  The former bears a very close resemblance to the little island near  Plymouth, whence it took its name: its latitude is 43 deg 48 min south,  longitude 146 deg 25 min east of Greenwich.    In running along shore, we cast many an anxious eye towards the land,  on which so much of our future destiny depended. Our distance, joined to  the haziness of the atmosphere, prevented us, however, from being able  to discover much. With our best glasses we could see nothing but hills  of a moderate height, cloathed with trees, to which some little patches  of white sandstone gave the appearance of being covered with snow. Many  fires were observed on the hills in the evening.    As no person in the ship I was on board had been on this coast before,  we consulted a little chart, published by Steele, of the Minories,  London, and found it, in general, very correct; it would be more so,  were not the Mewstone laid down at too great a distance from the land,  and one object made of the Eddystone and Swilly, when, in fact, they  are distinct. Between the two last is an entire bed of impassable rocks,  many of them above water. The latitude of the Eddystone is 43 deg 53  1/2 min, longitude 147 deg 9 min; that of Swilly 43 deg 54 min south,  longitude 147 deg 3 min east of Greenwich.    In the night the westerly wind, which had so long befriended us, died  away, and was succeeded by one from the north-east. When day appeared  we had lost sight of the land, and did not regain it until the 19th, at  only the distance of 17 leagues from our desired port. The wind was now  fair, the sky serene, though a little hazy, and the temperature of  the air delightfully pleasant: joy sparkled in every countenance, and  congratulations issued from every mouth. Ithaca itself was scarcely  more longed for by Ulysses, than Botany Bay by the adventurers who had  traversed so many thousand miles to take possession of it.    \"Heavily in clouds came on the day\" which ushered in our arrival. To us  it was \"a great, an important day,\" though I hope the foundation, not  the fall, of an empire will be dated from it.    On the morning of the 20th, by ten o'clock, the whole of the fleet had  cast anchor in Botany Bay, where, to our mutual satisfaction, we found  the Governor, and the first division of transports. On inquiry, we  heard, that the 'Supply' had arrived on the 18th, and the transports  only the preceding day.    Thus, after a passage of exactly thirty-six weeks from Portsmouth,  we happily effected our arduous undertaking, with such a train  of unexampled blessings as hardly ever attended a fleet in a like  predicament. Of two hundred and twelve marines we lost only one; and of  seven hundred and seventy-five convicts, put on board in England, but  twenty-four perished in our route. To what cause are we to attribute  this unhoped for success? I wish I could answer to the liberal manner in  which Government supplied the expedition. But when the reader is told,  that some of the necessary articles allowed to ships on a common passage  to West Indies, were withheld from us; that portable soup, wheat, and  pickled vegetables were not allowed; and that an inadequate quantity of  essence of malt was the only antiscorbutic supplied, his surprise will  redouble at the result of the voyage. For it must be remembered, that  the people thus sent out were not a ship's company starting with every  advantage of health and good living, which a state of freedom produces;  but the major part a miserable set of convicts, emaciated from  confinement, and in want of cloaths, and almost every convenience to  render so long a passage tolerable. I beg leave, however, to say, that  the provisions served on board were good, and of a much superior quality  to those usually supplied by contract: they were furnished by Mr.  Richards, junior, of Walworth, Surrey.          CHAPTER VIII.        From the Fleet's Arrival at Botany Bay to the Evacuation of it; and  taking Possession of Port Jackson. Interviews with the Natives; and an  Account of the Country about Botany Bay.      We had scarcely bid each other welcome on our arrival, when  an expedition up the Bay was undertaken by the Governor and  Lieutenant-Governor, in order to explore the nature of the country, and  fix on a spot to begin our operations upon. None, however, which could  be deemed very eligible, being discovered, his Excellency proceeded in  a boat to examine the opening, to which Mr. Cook had given the name of  Port Jackson, on an idea that a shelter for shipping within it might  be found. The boat returned on the evening of the 23rd, with such an  account of the harbour and advantages attending the place, that it  was determined the evacuation of Botany Bay should commence the next  morning.    In consequence of this decision, the few seamen and marines who had  been landed from the squadron, were instantly reimbarked, and every  preparation made to bid adieu to a port which had so long been the  subject of our conversation; which but three days before we had entered  with so many sentiments of satisfaction; and in which, as we had  believed, so many of our future hours were to be passed. The thoughts of  removal banished sleep, so that I rose at the first dawn of the morning.  But judge of my surprize on hearing from a serjeant, who ran down almost  breathless to the cabin where I was dressing, that a ship was seen off  the harbour's mouth. At first I only laughed, but knowing the man  who spoke to me to be of great veracity, and hearing him repeat his  information, I flew upon deck, on which I had barely set my foot, when  the cry of \"another sail\" struck on my astonished ear.    Confounded by a thousand ideas which arose in my mind in an instant, I  sprang upon the barricado and plainly descried two ships of considerable  size, standing in for the mouth of the Bay. By this time the alarm had  become general, and every one appeared lost in conjecture. Now they were  Dutchmen sent to dispossess us, and the moment after storeships from  England, with supplies for the settlement. The improbabilities which  attended both these conclusions, were sunk in the agitation of the  moment. It was by Governor Phillip, that this mystery was at length  unravelled, and the cause of the alarm pronounced to be two French  ships, which, it was now recollected, were on a voyage of discovery  in the southern hemisphere. Thus were our doubts cleared up, and our  apprehensions banished; it was, however, judged expedient to postpone  our removal to Port Jackson, until a complete confirmation of our  conjectures could be procured.    Had the sea breeze set in, the strange ships would have been at anchor  in the Bay by eight o'clock in the morning, but the wind blowing out,  they were driven by a strong lee current to the southward of the port.  On the following day they re-appeared in their former situation, and a  boat was sent to them, with a lieutenant of the navy in her, to offer  assistance, and point out the necessary marks for entering the harbour.  In the course of the day the officer returned, and brought intelligence  that the ships were the Boussole and Astrolabe, sent out by order of  the King of France, and under the command of Monsieur De Perrouse. The  astonishment of the French at seeing us, had not equalled that we had  experienced, for it appeared, that in the course of their voyage they  had touched at Kamschatka, and by that means learnt that our expedition  was in contemplation. They dropped anchor the next morning, just as  we had got under weigh to work out of the Bay, so that for the present  nothing more than salutations could pass between us.    Before I quit Botany Bay, I shall relate the observations we were  enabled to make during our short stay there; as well as those which our  subsequent visits to it from Port Jackson enabled us to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#5)"],[1,"uickly. \"We always  called it the matches. Don't you? Here, let me go first.\"    She did, and when they had reached the door she was waiting for  them with a candle in her hand. She thrust it on Gerald.    \"Hold it steady,\" she said, and undid the shutters of a long window,  so that first a yellow streak and then a blazing great oblong of light  flashed at them and the room was full of sunshine.    \"It makes the candle look quite silly,\" said Jimmy. \"So it does, said  the Princess, and blew out the candle. Then she took the key from  the outside of the door, put it in the inside keyhole, and turned it.    The room they were in was small and high. Its domed ceiling was  of deep blue with gold stars painted on it. The walls were of wood,  panelled and carved, and there was no furniture in it whatever.    \"This,\" said the Princess, \"is my treasure chamber.\" \"But where,  asked Kathleen politely, \"are the treasures?\"    \"Don't you see them?\" asked the Princess.    \"No, we don't,\" said Jimmy bluntly. \"You don't come that  bread-and-cheese game with me not twice over, you don't!\"    \"If you really don't see them,\" said the Princess, \"I suppose I shall  have to say the charm. Shut your eyes, please. And give me your  word of honour you won't look till I tell you, and that you'll never  tell anyone what you've seen.\"    Their words of honour were something that the children would  rather not have given just then, but they gave them all the same,  and shut their eyes tight.    \"Wiggadil yougadoo begadee leegadeeve nowgadow?\" said the  Princess rapidly; and they heard the swish of her silk train moving  across the room. Then there was a creaking, rustling noise.    \"She's locking us in!\" cried Jimmy.    \"Your word of honour,\" gasped Gerald.    \"Oh, do be quick!\" moaned Kathleen.    \"You may look,\" said the voice of the Princess. And they looked.  The room was not the same room, yet yes, the starry-vaulted blue  ceiling was there, and below it half a dozen feet of the dark  panelling, but below that the walls of the room blazed and  sparkled with white and blue and red and green and gold and  silver. Shelves ran round the room, and on them were gold cups  and silver dishes, and platters and goblets set with gems,  ornaments of gold and silver, tiaras of diamonds, necklaces of  rubies, strings of emeralds and pearls, all set out in unimaginable  splendour against a background of faded blue velvet. It was like  the Crown jewels that you see when your kind uncle takes you to  the Tower, only there seemed to be far more jewels than you or  anyone else has ever seen together at the Tower or anywhere else.    The three children remained breathless, open-mouthed, staring at  the sparkling splendours all about them, while the Princess stood,  her arm stretched out in a gesture of command, and a proud smile  on her lips.    \"My word!\" said Gerald, in a low whisper. But no one spoke out  loud. They waited as if spellbound for the Princess to speak.    She spoke.    \"What price bread-and-cheese games now?\" she asked  triumphantly. \"Can I do magic, or can't I?\"    \"You can; oh, you can!\" said Kathleen.    \"May we may we touch?\" asked Gerald.    \"All that's mine is yours,\" said the Princess, with a generous wave  of her brown hand, and added quickly, \"Only, of course, you  mustn't take anything away with you.\"    \"We're not thieves!\" said Jimmy. The others were already turning  over the wonderful things on the blue velvet shelves.    \"Perhaps not,\" said the Princess, \"but you're a very unbelieving  little boy. You think I can't see inside you, but I can. I know what  you've been thinking.\"    \"What?\" asked Jimmy.    \"Oh, you know well enough,\" said the Princess. \"You're thinking  about the bread and cheese that I changed into beef, and about  your secret fault. I say, let's all dress up and you be princes and  princesses too.\"    \"To crown our hero,\" said Gerald, lifting a gold crown with a cross  on the top, \"was the work of a moment.\" He put the crown on his  head, and added a collar of SS and a zone of sparkling emeralds,  which would not quite meet round his middle. He turned from  fixing it by an ingenious adaptation of his belt to find the others  already decked with diadems, necklaces, and rings.    \"How splendid you look!\" said the Princess, \"and how I wish your  clothes were prettier. What ugly clothes people wear nowadays! A  hundred years ago \"    Kathleen stood quite still with a diamond bracelet raised in her  hand.    \"I say,\" she said. \"The King and Queen?\"    \"What King and Queen?\" asked the Princess.    \"Your father and mother,\" your sorrowing parents, said Kathleen.  \"They'll have waked up by now. Won't they be wanting to see you,  after a hundred years, you know?\"    \"Oh ah yes,\" said the Princess slowly. \"I embraced my rejoicing  parents when I got the bread and cheese. They re having their  dinner. They won't expect me yet. Here,\" she added, hastily putting  a ruby bracelet on Kathleen's arm, \"see how splendid that is!\"    Kathleen would have been quite content to go on all day trying on  different jewels and looking at herself in the little silver-framed  mirror that the Princess took from one of the shelves, but the boys  were soon weary of this amusement.    \"Look here,\" said Gerald, \"if you're sure your father and mother  won't want you, let's go out and have a jolly good game of  something. You could play besieged castles awfully well in that  maze unless you can do any more magic tricks.\"    \"You forget,\" said the Princess, \"I'm grown up. I don't play games.  And I don't like to do too much magic at a time, it's so tiring.  Besides, it'll take us ever so long to put all these things back in  their proper places.\"    It did. The children would have laid the jewels just anywhere; but  the Princess showed them that every necklace, or ring, or bracelet  had its own home on the velvet a slight hollowing in the shelf  beneath, so that each stone fitted into its own little nest.    As Kathleen was fitting the last shining ornament into its proper  place, she saw that part of the shelf near it held, not bright jewels,  but rings and brooches and chains, as well as queer things that she  did not know the names of, and all were of dull metal and odd  shapes.    \"What's all this rubbish?\" she asked.    \"Rubbish, indeed!\" said the Princess. \"Why those are all magic  things! This bracelet anyone who wears it has got to speak the  truth. This chain makes you as strong as ten men; if you wear this  spur your horse will go a mile a minute; or if you're walking it's the  same as seven-league boots.\"    \"What does this brooch do?\" asked Kathleen, reaching out her  hand. The princess caught her by the wrist.    \"You mustn't touch,\" she said; \"if anyone but me touches them all  the magic goes out at once and never comes back. That brooch  will give you any wish you like.\"    \"And this ring?\" Jimmy pointed.    \"Oh, that makes you invisible.\"    \"What's this?\" asked Gerald, showing a curious buckle.    \"Oh, that undoes the effect of all the other charms.\"    \"Do you mean really?\" Jimmy asked. \"You're not just kidding?\"    \"Kidding indeed!\" repeated the Princess scornfully. \"I should have  thought I'd shown you enough magic to prevent you speaking to a  Princess like that!\"    \"I say,\" said Gerald, visibly excited. \"You might show us how  some of the things act. Couldn't you give us each a wish?\"    The Princess did not at once answer. And the minds of the three  played with granted wishes brilliant yet thoroughly reasonable  the  kind of wish that never seems to occur to people in fairy-tales  when they suddenly get a chance to have their three wishes  granted.    \"No,\" said the Princess suddenly, \"no; I can't give wishes to you, it  only gives me wishes. But I'll let you see the ring make me  invisible. Only you must shut your eyes while I do it.\"    They shut them.    \"Count fifty,\" said the Princess, \"and then you may look. And then  you must shut them again, and count fifty, and I'll reappear.\"    Gerald counted, aloud. Through the counting one could hear a  creaking, rustling sound.    \"Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty!\" said Gerald, and they  opened their eyes.    They were alone in the room. The jewels had vanished and so had  the Princess.    \"She's gone out by the door, of course,\" said Jimmy, but the door  was locked.    \"That is magic,\" said Kathleen breathlessly. \"Maskelyne and  Devant can do that trick, said Jimmy. \"And I want my tea.\"    \"Your tea!\" Gerald's tone was full of contempt. \"The lovely  Princess, he went on, \"reappeared as soon as our hero had finished  counting fifty. One, two, three, four ,\"    Gerald and Kathleen had both closed their eyes. But somehow  Jimmy hadn't. He didn't mean to cheat, he just forgot. And as  Gerald's count reached twenty he saw a panel under the window  open slowly.    \"Her,\" he said to himself. \"I knew it was a trick!\" and at once shut  his eyes, like an honourable little boy.    On the word \"fifty\" six eyes opened. And the panel was closed and  there was no Princess.    \"She hasn't pulled it off this time,\" said Gerald. \"Perhaps you'd  better count again,\" said Kathleen. \"I believe there's a cupboard  under the window,\" said Jimmy, \"and she's hidden in it. Secret  panel, you know.\"    \"You looked! That's cheating,\" said the voice of the Princess so  close to his ear that he quite jumped.    \"I didn't cheat.\"    \"Where on earth What ever ,\" said all three together. For still there  was no Princess to be seen.    \"Come back visible, Princess dear,\" said Kathleen. \"Shall we shut  our eyes and count again?\"    \"Don't be silly!\" said the voice of the Princess, and it sounded very  cross.    \"We're not silly,\" said Jimmy, and his voice was cross too. \"Why  can't you come back and have done with it? You know you're only  hiding.\"    \"Don't!\" said Kathleen gently. \"She is invisible, you know.\"    \"So should I be if I got into the cupboard,\" said Jimmy.    \"Oh yes,\" said"]]]
