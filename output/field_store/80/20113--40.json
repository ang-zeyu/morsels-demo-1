The  custom of physically marrying men and women to trees is still  practised in India and other parts of the East. Why should it not  have obtained in ancient Latium?    Reviewing the evidence as a whole, we may conclude that the worship  of Diana in her sacred grove at Nemi was of great importance and  immemorial antiquity; that she was revered as the goddess of  woodlands and of wild creatures, probably also of domestic cattle  and of the fruits of the earth; that she was believed to bless men  and women with offspring and to aid mothers in childbed; that her  holy fire, tended by chaste virgins, burned perpetually in a round  temple within the precinct; that associated with her was a  water-nymph Egeria who discharged one of Diana's own functions by  succouring women in travail, and who was popularly supposed to have  mated with an old Roman king in the sacred grove; further, that  Diana of the Wood herself had a male companion Virbius by name, who  was to her what Adonis was to Venus, or Attis to Cybele; and,  lastly, that this mythical Virbius was represented in historical  times by a line of priests known as Kings of the Wood, who regularly  perished by the swords of their successors, and whose lives were in  a manner bound up with a certain tree in the grove, because so long  as that tree was uninjured they were safe from attack.    Clearly these conclusions do not of themselves suffice to explain  the peculiar rule of succession to the priesthood. But perhaps the  survey of a wider field may lead us to think that they contain in  germ the solution of the problem. To that wider survey we must now  address ourselves. It will be long and laborious, but may possess  something of the interest and charm of a voyage of discovery, in  which we shall visit many strange foreign lands, with strange  foreign peoples, and still stranger customs. The wind is in the  shrouds: we shake out our sails to it, and leave the coast of Italy  behind us for a time.          II. Priestly Kings    THE questions which we have set ourselves to answer are mainly two:  first, why had Diana's priest at Nemi, the King of the Wood, to slay  his predecessor? second, why before doing so had he to pluck the  branch of a certain tree which the public opinion of the ancients  identified with Virgil's Golden Bough?    The first point on which we fasten is the priest's title. Why was he  called the King of the Wood? Why was his office spoken of as a  kingdom?    The union of a royal title with priestly duties was common in  ancient Italy and Greece. At Rome and in other cities of Latium  there was a priest called the Sacrificial King or King of the Sacred  Rites, and his wife bore the title of Queen of the Sacred Rites. In  republican Athens the second annual magistrate of the state was  called the King, and his wife the Queen; the functions of both were  religious. Many other Greek democracies had titular kings, whose  duties, so far as they are known, seem to have been priestly, and to  have centered round the Common Hearth of the state. Some Greek  states had several of these titular kings, who held office  simultaneously. At Rome the tradition was that the Sacrificial King  had been appointed after the abolition of the monarchy in order to  offer the sacrifices which before had been offered by the kings. A  similar view as to the origin of the priestly kings appears to have  prevailed in Greece. In itself the opinion is not improbable, and it  is borne out by the example of Sparta, almost the only purely Greek  state which retained the kingly form of government in historical  times. For in Sparta all state sacrifices were offered by the kings  as descendants of the god. One of the two Spartan kings held the  priesthood of Zeus Lacedaemon, the other the priesthood of Heavenly  Zeus.    This combination of priestly functions with royal authority is  familiar to every one. Asia Minor, for example, was the seat of  various great religious capitals peopled by thousands of sacred  slaves, and ruled by pontiffs who wielded at once temporal and  spiritual authority, like the popes of mediaeval Rome. Such  priest-ridden cities were Zela and Pessinus. Teutonic kings, again,  in the old heathen days seem to have stood in the position, and to  have exercised the powers, of high priests. The Emperors of China  offered public sacrifices, the details of which were regulated by  the ritual books. The King of Madagascar was high-priest of the  realm. At the great festival of the new year, when a bullock was  sacrificed for the good of the kingdom, the king stood over the  sacrifice to offer prayer and thanksgiving, while his attendants  slaughtered the animal. In the monarchical states which still  maintain their independence among the Gallas of Eastern Africa, the  king sacrifices on the mountain tops and regulates the immolation of  human victims; and the dim light of tradition reveals a similar  union of temporal and spiritual power, of royal and priestly duties,  in the kings of that delightful region of Central America whose  ancient capital, now buried under the rank growth of the tropical  forest, is marked by the stately and mysterious ruins of Palenque.    When we have said that the ancient kings were commonly priests also,  we are far from having exhausted the religious aspect of their  office. In those days the divinity that hedges a king was no empty  form of speech, but the expression of a sober belief. Kings were  revered, in many cases not merely as priests, that is, as  intercessors between man and god, but as themselves gods, able to  bestow upon their subjects and worshippers those blessings which are  commonly supposed to be beyond the reach of mortals, and are sought,  if at all, only by prayer and sacrifice offered to superhuman and  invisible beings. Thus kings are often expected to give rain and  sunshine in due season, to make the crops grow, and so on. Strange  as this expectation appears to us, it is quite of a piece with early  modes of thought. A savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly  drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the  supernatural. To him the world is to a great extent worked by  supernatural agents, that is, by personal beings acting on impulses  and motives like his own, liable like him to be moved by appeals to  their pity, their hopes, and their fears. In a world so conceived he  sees no limit to his power of influencing the course of nature to  his own advantage. Prayers, promises, or threats may secure him fine  weather and an abundant crop from the gods; and if a god should  happen, as he sometimes believes, to become incarnate in his own  person, then he need appeal to no higher being; he, the savage,  possesses in himself all the powers necessary to further his own  well-being and that of his fellow-men.    This is one way in which the idea of a man-god is reached. But there  is another. Along with the view of the world as pervaded by  spiritual forces, savage man has a different, and probably still  older, conception in which we may detect a germ of the modern notion  of natural law or the view of nature as a series of events occurring  in an invariable order without the intervention of personal agency.  The germ of which I speak is involved in that sympathetic magic, as  it may be called, which plays a large part in most systems of  superstition. In early society the king is frequently a magician as  well as a priest; indeed he appears to have often attained to power  by virtue of his supposed proficiency in the black or white art.  Hence in order to understand the evolution of the kingship and the  sacred character with which the office has commonly been invested in  the eyes of savage or barbarous peoples, it is essential to have  some acquaintance with the principles of magic and to form some  conception of the extraordinary hold which that ancient system of  superstition has had on the human mind in all ages and all  countries. Accordingly I propose to consider the subject in some  detail.        III. Sympathetic Magic      1. The Principles of Magic    IF we analyse the principles of thought on which magic is based,  they will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first,  that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause;  and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each  other continue to act on each other at a distance after the  physical contact has been severed. The former principle may be  called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or  Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of  Similarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he  desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that  whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the  person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed  part of his body or not. Charms based on the Law of Similarity may  be called Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic. Charms based on the Law  of Contact or Contagion may be called Contagious Magic. To denote  the first of these branches of magic the term Homoeopathic is  perhaps preferable, for the alternative term Imitative or Mimetic  suggests, if it does not imply, a conscious agent who imitates,  thereby limiting the scope of magic too narrowly. For the same  principles which the magician applies in the practice of his art  are implicitly believed by him to regulate the operations of  inanimate nature; in other words, he tacitly assumes that the Laws  of Similarity and Contact are of universal application and are not  limited to human actions. In short, magic is a spurious system of  natural law as well as a fallacious guide of conduct; it is a false  science as well as an abortive art. Regarded as a system of natural  law, that is, as a statement of the rules which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36299"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#5)"],[1,"g.    85.

Punishment would be given to the  offender by the community.         There were occasional meetings of \"hundreds\", which were 100  households, to settle widespread disputes. The chief officer was  \"hundreder\" or \"constable\". He was responsible for keeping the peace of  the hundred.         The Druid priests decided all disputes of the Celts.                                         - - - Chapter 2 - - -                                     - The Times: 600-900 -         The country was inhabited by Anglo-Saxons. The French called it  \"Angleterre\", which means the angle or end of the earth. It was called  \"Angle land\", which later became \"England\".         A community was usually an extended family. Its members lived a village  in which a stone church was the most prominent building. They lived in  one-room huts with walls and roofs made of wood, mud, and straw.  Hangings covered the cracks in the walls to keep the wind out. Smoke  from a fire in the middle of the room filtered out of cracks in the  roof. Grain was ground at home by rotating by hand one stone disk on  another stone disk. Some villages had a mill powered by the flow of  water or by horses. All freeholders had the duty of watch [at night] and  ward [during the day], of following the hue and cry to chase an  offender, and of taking the oath of peace. These three duties were  constant until 1195.         Farmland surrounded the villages and was farmed by the community as a  whole under the direction of a lord. There was silver, copper, iron,  tin, gold, and various types of stones from remote lead mines and  quarries in the nation. Silver pennies replaced the smaller scaetts.  Freemen paid \"scot\" and bore \"lot\" according to their means for local  purposes.         Offa, the strongest of the Saxon kings, minted high-quality silver  pennies. He traded woolen coats for lava grindstones with Emperor  Charlemagne, who used a silver denarius coin. There were 12 denarii to  the solidus and 20 soldi to the pound of silver. These denominations  were taken by England as 12 pennies to the shilling and 20 shillings to  the pound. The pound sign, an \"L\" with a hash mark derived from the word  Libra, which meant weighing scales.         Everyone in the village went to church on Sunday and brought gifts such  as grain to the priest. Later, contributions in the form of money became  customary, and then expected. They were called \"tithes\" and were spent  for church repair, the clergy, and poor and needy laborers. Local custom  determined the amount. There was also church-scot: a payment to the  clergy in lieu of the first fruits of the land. The priest was the  chaplain of a landlord and his parish was coextensive with that  landlord's holding and could include one to several villages. The priest  and other men who helped him, lived in the church building. Some  churches had lead roofs and iron hinges, latches, and locks on their  doors. The land underneath had been given to the church by former kings  and persons who wanted the church to say prayers to help their souls go  from purgatory to heaven and who also selected the first priest. The  priest conducted Christianized Easter ceremonies in the spring and  (Christ's mass) ceremonies in winter in place of the pagan Yuletide  festivities. Burning incense took the place of pagan burnt animal  offerings, which were accompanied by incense to disguise the odor of  burning flesh. Holy water replaced haunted wells and streams. Christian  incantations replaced sorcerer's spells. Nuns assisted priests in  celebrating mass and administering the sacraments. They alone  consecrated new nuns. Vestry meetings were community meetings held for  church purposes. The people said their prayers in English, and the  priest conducted the services in English. A person joined his hands in  prayer as if to offer them for binding together in submission.         The church baptized babies and officiated or gave blessings at marriage  ceremonies. It also said prayers for the dying, gave them funerals, and  buried them. There were burial service fees, candle dues, and plough  alms. A piece of stone with the dead person's name marked his grave. It  was thought that putting the name on the grave would assist  identification of that person for being taken to heaven. The church  heard the last wish or will of the person dying concerning who he wanted  to have his property. The church taught that it was not necessary to  bury possessions with the deceased. The church taught boys and girls.          man carried a horn slung on his shoulder as he went about his work so  that he could at once send out a warning to his fellow villagers or call  them in chasing a thief or other offender. The forests were full of  outlaws, so strangers who did not blow a horn to announce themselves  were presumed to be fugitive offenders who could be shot on sight. An  eorl could call upon the ceorl farmers for about forty days to fight off  an invading group.         There were several kingdoms, whose boundaries kept changing due to  warfare, which was a sin according to the church. They were each  governed by a king and witan of wise men who met at a witanegemot, which  was usually held three times a year, mostly on great church festivals  and at the end of the harvest. The king and witan chose the witan's  members of bishops, eorldormen, and thegns [landholding farmers]. The  king and hereditary claims played a major part in the selection of the  eorldormen, who were the highest military leaders and often of the royal  family. They were also chief magistrates of large jurisdictional areas  of land. The witan included officers of the king's household and perhaps  other of his retinue. There was little distinction then between his  gesith, fighting men, guards, household companions, dependents, and  servants. The king was sometimes accompanied by his wife and sons at the  witanagemot. A king was selected by the witan according to his  worthiness, usually from among the royal family, and could be deposed by  it. The witan and king decided on laws, taxes, and transfers of land.  They made determinations of war and peace and directed the army and the  fleet. The king wore a crown or royal helmet. He extended certain  protections by the king's peace. He could erect castles and bridges and  could provide a special protection to strangers.         A king had not only a wergeld to be paid to his family if he were  killed, but a \"cynebot\" of equal amount that would be paid to his  kingdom's people. A king's household had a chamberlain for the royal  bedchamber, a marshall to oversee the horses and military equipment, a  steward as head of household, and a cupbearer. The king had income from  fines for breach of his peace; fines and forfeitures from courts dealing  with criminal and civil cases; salvage from ship wrecks; treasure trove  [assets hidden or buried in times of war]; treasures of the earth such  as gold and silver; mines; saltworks; tolls and other dues of markets,  ports, and the routes by land and by river generally; heriot from heirs  of his special dependents for possession of land (usually in kind,  principally in horses and weapons). He also had rights of purveyance  [hospitality and maintenance when traveling]. The king had private  lands, which he could dispose of by his will. He also had crown lands,  which belonged to his office and could not be alienated without consent  of the witan. Crown lands often included palaces and their appendant  farms, and burhs. It was a queen's duty to run the royal estate. Also, a  queen could possess, manage, and dispose of lands in her name. Violent  queens waged wars. Kingdoms were often allied by marriage between their  royal families. There were also royal marriages to royalty on the  continent.         The houses of the wealthy had ornamented silk hangings on the walls.  Some had fine white ox horn shaved so thin they were transparent for  windows. Brightly colored drapery, often purple, and fly nets surrounded  their beds, which were covered with the fur of animals. They slept in  bed clothes on pillows stuffed with straw. Tables plated with silver and  gems held silver candlesticks, gold and silver goblets and cups, and  lamps of gold, silver, or glass. They used silver mirrors and silver  writing pens. There were covered seats, benches, and footstools with the  head and feet of animals at their extremities. They ate from a table  covered with a cloth. Servants brought in food on spits, from which they  ate. Food was boiled, broiled, or baked. The wealthy ate wheat bread and  others ate barley bread. Ale made from barley was passed around in a  cup. Mead made from honey was also drunk.         Men wore long-sleeved wool and linen garments reaching almost to the  knee, around which they wore a belt tied in a knot. Men often wore a  gold ring on the fourth finger of the right hand. Leather shoes were  fastened with leather thongs around the ankle. Their hair was parted in  the middle and combed down each side in waving ringlets. The beard was  parted in the middle of the chin, so that it ended in two points. The  clergy did not wear beards. Great men wore gold-embroidered clothes,  gilt buckles and brooches, and"]]]
