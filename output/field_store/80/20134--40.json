The murderess in her suit of apple-green has pounced on some sleeping  Cicada.    My boarders' menu is settled: I will feed them on Cicadae. They take  such a liking to this fare that, in two or three weeks, the floor of  the cage is a knacker's yard strewn with heads and empty thoraces, with  torn-off wings and disjointed legs. The belly alone disappears almost  entirely. This is the tit-bit, not very substantial, but extremely  tasty, it would seem. Here, in fact, in the insect's crop, the syrup is  accumulated, the sugary sap which the Cicada's gimlet taps from the  tender bark. Is it because of this dainty that the prey's abdomen is  preferred to any other morsel? It is quite possible.    I do, in fact, with a view to varying the diet, decide to serve up some  very sweet fruits, slices of pear, grape-bits, bits of melon. All this  meets with delighted appreciation. The Green Grasshopper resembles the  English: she dotes on underdone meat seasoned with jelly. This perhaps  is why, on catching the Cicada, she first rips up his paunch, which  supplies a mixture of flesh and preserves.    To eat Cicadae and sugar is not possible in every part of the country.  In the north, where she abounds, the Green Grasshopper would not find  the dish which attracts her so strongly here. She must have other  resources. To convince myself of this, I give her Anoxiae (A. pilosa,  Fab.), the summer equivalent of the spring Cockchafer. The Beetle is  accepted without hesitation. Nothing is left of him but the wing-cases,  head and legs. The result is the same with the magnificent plump Pine  Cockchafer (Melolontha fullo, Lin.), a sumptuous morsel which I find  next day eviscerated by my gang of knackers.    These examples teach us enough. They tell us that the Grasshopper is an  inveterate consumer of insects, especially of those which are not  protected by too hard a cuirass; they are evidence of tastes which are  highly carnivorous, but not exclusively so, like those of the Praying  Mantis, who refuses everything except game. The butcher of the Cicadae  is able to modify an excessively heating diet with vegetable fare.  After meat and blood, sugary fruit-pulp; sometimes even, for lack of  anything better, a little green stuff.    Nevertheless, cannibalism is prevalent. True, I never witness in my  Grasshopper-cages the savagery which is so common in the Praying  Mantis, who harpoons her rivals and devours her lovers; but, if some  weakling succumb, the survivors hardly ever fail to profit by his  carcass as they would in the case of any ordinary prey. With no  scarcity of provisions as an excuse, they feast upon their defunct  companion. For the rest, all the sabre-bearing clan display, in varying  degrees, a propensity for filling their bellies with their maimed  comrades.    In other respects, the Grasshoppers live together very peacefully in my  cages. No serious strife ever takes place among them, nothing beyond a  little rivalry in the matter of food. I hand in a piece of pear. A  Grasshopper alights on it at once. Jealously she kicks away any one  trying to bite at the delicious morsel. Selfishness reigns everywhere.  When she has eaten her fill, she makes way for another, who in her turn  becomes intolerant. One after the other, all the inmates of the  menagerie come and refresh themselves. After cramming their crops, they  scratch the soles of their feet a little with their mandibles, polish  up their forehead and eyes with a leg moistened with spittle and then,  hanging to the trellis-work or lying on the sand in a posture of  contemplation, blissfully they digest and slumber most of the day,  especially during the hottest part of it.    It is in the evening, after sunset, that the troop becomes lively. By  nine o'clock the animation is at its height. With sudden rushes they  clamber to the top of the dome, to descend as hurriedly and climb up  once more. They come and go tumultuously, run and hop around the  circular track and, without stopping, nibble at the good things on the  way.    The males are stridulating by themselves, here and there, teasing the  passing fair with their antennae. The future mothers stroll about  gravely, with their sabre half-raised. The agitation and feverish  excitement means that the great business of pairing is at hand. The  fact will escape no practised eye.    It is also what I particularly wish to observe. My wish is satisfied,  but not fully, for the late hours at which events take place did not  allow me to witness the final act of the wedding. It is late at night  or early in the morning that things happen.    The little that I see is confined to interminable preludes. Standing  face to face, with foreheads almost touching, the lovers feel and sound  each other for a long time with their limp antennae. They suggest two  fencers crossing and recrossing harmless foils. From time to time, the  male stridulates a little, gives a few short strokes of the bow and  then falls silent, feeling perhaps too much overcome to continue.  Eleven o'clock strikes; and the declaration is not yet over. Very  regretfully, but conquered by sleepiness, I quit the couple.    Next morning, early, the female carries, hanging at the bottom of her  ovipositor, a queer bladder-like arrangement, an opaline capsule, the  size of a large pea and roughly subdivided into a small number of  egg-shaped vesicles. When the insect walks, the thing scrapes along the  ground and becomes dirty with sticky grains of sand. The Grasshopper  then makes a banquet off this fertilizing capsule, drains it slowly of  its contents, and devours it bit by bit; for a long time she chews and  rechews the gummy morsel and ends by swallowing it all down. In less  than half a day, the milky burden has disappeared, consumed with zest  down to the last atom.    This inconceivable banquet must be imported, one would think, from  another planet, so far removed is it from earthly habits. What a  singular race are the Locustidae, one of the oldest in the animal  kingdom on dry land and, like the Scolopendra and the Cephalopod,  acting as a belated representative of the manners of antiquity!        CHAPTER 3. THE EMPUSA.    The sea, life's first foster-mother, still preserves in her depths many  of those singular and incongruous shapes which were the earliest  attempts of the animal kingdom; the land, less fruitful, but with more  capacity for progress, has almost wholly lost the strange forms of  other days. The few that remain belong especially to the series of  primitive insects, insects exceedingly limited in their industrial  powers and subject to very summary metamorphoses, if to any at all. In  my district, in the front rank of those entomological anomalies which  remind us of the denizens of the old coal-forests, stand the Mantidae,  including the Praying Mantis, so curious in habits and structure. Here  also is the Empusa (E. pauperata, Latr.), the subject of this chapter.    Her larva is certainly the strangest creature among the terrestrial  fauna of Provence: a slim, swaying thing of so fantastic an appearance  that uninitiated fingers dare not lay hold of it. The children of my  neighbourhood, impressed by its startling shape, call it \"the  Devilkin.\" In their imaginations, the queer little creature savours of  witchcraft. One comes across it, though always sparsely, in spring, up  to May; in autumn; and sometimes in winter, if the sun be strong. The  tough grasses of the waste-lands, the stunted bushes which catch the  sun and are sheltered from the wind by a few heaps of stones are the  chilly Empusa's favourite abode.    Let us give a rapid sketch of her. The abdomen, which always curls up  so as to join the back, spreads paddle wise and twists into a crook.  Pointed scales, a sort of foliaceous expansions arranged in three rows,  cover the lower surface, which becomes the upper surface because of the  crook aforesaid. The scaly crook is propped on four long, thin stilts,  on four legs armed with knee-pieces, that is to say, carrying at the  end of the thigh, where it joins the shin, a curved, projecting blade  not unlike that of a cleaver.    Above this base, this four-legged stool, rises, at a sudden angle, the  stiff corselet, disproportionately long and almost perpendicular. The  end of this bust, round and slender as a straw, carries the  hunting-trap, the grappling limbs, copied from those of the Mantis.  They consist of a terminal harpoon, sharper than a needle, and a cruel  vice, with the jaws toothed like a saw. The jaw formed by the arm  proper is hollowed into a groove and carries on either side five long  spikes, with smaller indentations in between. The jaw formed by the  forearm is similarly furrowed, but its double saw, which fits into the  groove of the upper arm when at rest, is formed of finer, closer and  more regular teeth. The magnifying-glass reveals a score of equal  points in each row. The machine only lacks size to be a fearful  implement of torture.    The head is in keeping with this arsenal. What a queer-shaped head it  is! A pointed face, with walrus moustaches furnished by the palpi;  large goggle eyes; between them, a dirk, a halberd blade; and, on the  forehead a mad, unheard of thing: a sort of tall mitre, an extravagant  head-dress that juts forward, spreading right and left into peaked  wings and cleft along the top. What does the Devilkin want with that  monstrous pointed cap, than which no wise man of the East, no  astrologer of old ever wore a more splendiferous? This we shall learn  when we see her out hunting.    The dress is commonplace; grey tints predominate. Towards the end of  the larval period, after a few moultings, it begins to give a glimpse  of the adult's richer livery and becomes striped, still very faintly,  with pale-green, white and pink. Already the two sexes are  distinguished by their antennae."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37566"],[0,"Natural History of the Ornate Box Turtle, Terrapene ornata ornata Agassiz (#5)"],[1,"(southwestern and western edges of range); 2) temperatures causing the  ground to freeze deep enough (approximately 30 inches) to kill turtles  in hibernacula (northern edge of range); and, 3) the lack of one or  more relatively wet periods in the course of the warm season,  preventing at least temporary emergence from quiescence (southwestern  edge of range).          HABITAT IN KANSAS      Clarke (1958:40-45) reported _T. o. ornata_ in all terrestrial  communities studied in Osage County; he considered the subspecies to  be characteristic of the \"... cultivated-field community ...\" and to  be of frequent occurrence in (but not characteristic of) the \"...  Oak-Walnut Hillside Forest ..., Buckbrush-Sumac ..., and Prairie  communities ...\". Brennan (1937:345) found _T. o. ornata_ to be  equally abundant in mixed prairie and prairie-streamside habitats in  Ellis County; the subspecies was much rarer on rocky hillsides and in  the habitat surrounding prairie ponds. Carpenter (1940:641) listed _T.  o. ornata_ as an inhabitant of \"... tall and mixed-grass prairies ...\"  (also in Oklahoma and Nebraska). Fitch (1958:99) found the order of  preference for habitats at the Natural History Reservation to be  grazed pasture land, woodland, open fields with undisturbed prairie  vegetation, and fallow fields with a rank growth of weeds.    At the Damm Farm the greatest number of box turtles was collected on  the pasture, especially in three areas designated in Plate 1 as the  \"northwest corner,\" \"southern ravine,\" and \"house pond\" areas. These  three areas had several features in common. All contained ravines and  rocky slopes that provided many places of concealment (dens, burrows  of larger animals, and suitable substrate for the excavation of  earthen forms). All contained water (in ponds and intermittent  streams) for most of the year; and, all were frequented daily by  cattle that left an abundant supply of dung in which box turtles  foraged. In addition, each of the three areas contained at least one  mulberry tree, under which fruit was abundant in the months of June  and July.    The relative numbers of box turtles found in different areas on the  Damm Farm were, of course, governed to some extent by my activity in  these areas and by the relative ease with which box turtles were seen  in different types of vegetational cover. Turtles were more easily  seen in the pasture (especially in sparsely vegetated or denuded  areas) where much of my field work was done on horseback, than in the  wooded areas, where excursions were usually made on foot. It was  evident, however, after mapping known ranges and studying patterns of  movement in marked turtles, that concentrations in the three  above-mentioned areas of pasture were an indication of actual  preference by turtles for the more favorable habitat in these areas  rather than the result of incomplete sampling.          REPRODUCTION      Mating    Mating takes place throughout the season of activity but is most  common in spring--soon after emergence from hibernation--and in  autumn. Turtles frequently copulated in the laboratory in spring and  autumn. Copulation was observed under natural conditions on several  occasions but only once at the Damm Farm.    Norris and Zwiefel (1950:4) saw two captive individuals of _T. o.  luteola_ copulating on 12 August; copulation lasted two hours.  Brumwell (1940:391-2) gave the following description of mating in _T.  o. ornata_. A male pursued a female for nearly half an hour, first  nudging the margins of her shell and later approaching her rapidly  from the rear and hurling himself on her back in an attempt to mount,  at the same time emitting a stream of liquid from each nostril. The  liquid was presumably water; both sexes had imbibed water in a pond  just before courtship began. Brumwell suggested that pressure on the  plastron of the male had forced the water out his nostrils. The pair  remained in the coital position for 30 minutes after the male had  achieved intromission. In another instance, Brumwell (_loc. cit._) saw  four males pursuing a single female, the males exhibiting the same  behavior (nudging and lunging) outlined above. Males that attempted to  mount other males were repelled by defensive snapping of the  approached male. The female also snapped at some of the males that  tried to mount her. One male was finally successful in mounting and  was henceforth unmolested by the other males. Brumwell suggested that  shell biting and tapping may be methods of sex-recognition.    In the several instances of mating that I observed, the male, after  mounting the shell of the female (Pl. 28), gripped her, with the first  claws of his hind feet, just beneath her legs or on the skin of the  gluteal region and, with the remaining three claws, gripped the  posterior edges of her plastron. In most instances the female secured  the male's legs by hooking her own legs around them. The coital  position of _T. ornata_ seems to differ from that of _T. carolina_, at  least in regard to the position of the male's legs. The coital  positions of _T. carolina_ illustrated by Cahn (1937:94, Fig. 13) are  physically impossible for _T. ornata_.    In _T. ornata_ the pressure exerted on the male's legs by the female  probably impairs circulation and probably is painful to the male,  especially after coitus, when the male falls backward but is still  held by the female. The heavily developed musculature of the legs of  males may be an adaptation to strengthen the legs for this temporary  period of stress. Evans (1953:191) and Cahn and Conder (1932:87-88)  observed the hind legs of males of _T. carolina_ to be noticeably  weakened after copulation, causing the males to remain inactive for  several hours.    Evans (_op. cit._) observed 72 matings of _T. carolina_ and divided  the process into three phases as follows: 1) circling, pushing and  biting by the male; 2) mounting (female with shell closed); and, 3)  coition (female with shell open). Penn and Pottharst (1940:26)  reported that captive _T. carolina_ in New Orleans mated chiefly under  conditions of optimum temperature (21 to 27A deg. C.) and high humidity;  some matings took place in a pool of water. Males pushed females about  after mating, often rolling them over several times.    Because ornate box turtles observed by me were able easily to right  themselves from an inverted position on substrata of all kinds, males  left lying on their backs after copulation are probably in no danger  of perishing in this position, as was suggested by Allard (1939) for  _T. carolina_.      Insemination    Oviducts of several females were flushed by means of a pipette to  determine whether they contained sperm. Approximately half of the  females captured in May, 1956, had sperm in their oviducts, but  females captured in June and July did not. Sperm flushed from the  oviducts were in clumps of several hundred and showed no sign of  motility a few minutes after the female was anesthetized with  chloroform. No sperm were found in the oviducts of immature females  but one female of nearly adult size was observed in copulation with a  mature male.    Thorough examination of microscopic sections of oviduct (taken at  various times in the season of activity) usually revealed a few sperm  lodged in the folds (Pl. 19, Fig. 8) of the cephalic as well as the  caudal portion of the tube, but no specialized seminal receptacles  such as occur in snakes (Fox, 1956) were present. Fertilization  without reinsemination probably occurs in _T. ornata_. Ewing (1943)  and Finneran (1948:126) reported that females of _T. carolina_  produced fertile eggs for periods of four and two years, respectively,  after being removed from all contact with males.      Sexual Cycle of Males    Testes were preserved in each month from April to October. The  following description of spermatogenesis is based chiefly on material  collected in 1955, although testes were preserved also in 1954.  Comparison of material obtained in 1954 and 1955 revealed that  spermatogenesis began earlier and was more advanced on any given date  in 1955 than in 1954.    Testes of mature individuals are pale yellow and slightly oblong. The  epididymis is ordinarily dark brown or black and contrasts sharply  with the color of the testes. Size of testes was expressed as the  average length (greatest diameter) of both testes. Testes are smallest  in April, immediately after emergence from hibernation, and largest in  early September (Pl. 20, Figs. 3-4). They are nearly spherical when of  maximum size; increase in bulk, therefore, is relatively greater than  the increase in size shown in Figure 3. They increase in size from  April until early June, recede during most of June, and again increase  in size in July and August. They remain large from early September  until hibernation is begun, becoming only slightly smaller in late  September and October.    Increase in size following emergence from hibernation may be due in  part to proliferation of the sustentacular cytoplasm. Decrease in size  in early June is correlated with the end of the period of most active  mating; maximal size is coincident with the peak of the spermatogenic  cycle in early September.       [Illustration: FIG. 3. Seasonal fluctuations in size (average         greatest diameter) of testes in _T. o. ornata_ as determined         by examination of 40 specimens from eastern Kansas.]    Spermatogenesis (refer to Pl. 19, Figs. 1-5) begins in early May when  a few spermatogonia appear in the seminiferous tubules. The  histological appearance of testes preserved in April and May is much  the same. Nuclei of Sertoli cells, which outnumber the spermatogonia,  are evident at the periphery of the tubules and the clear cytoplasm of  the cells extends into and nearly fills the lumina. The few darkly  stained spermatids that are present in April are cells that probably  were produced in the"]]]
