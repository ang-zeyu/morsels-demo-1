These all were then pull'd down and destroyed; and the materials, lead,  timber, and stone exposed to sale, for any that would buy them. But  some of the bargains proved not very prosperous; the lead especially  that came off the palace, was as fatal as the gold of Tholouse; for to  my knowledge, the merchant that bought it, lost it all, and the ship  which carried it, in her voyage to Holland.    \"And thus the church continued ruined and desolate, and without all  divine offices for a time; till at length by the favour of a great  person in the neighbourhood, it was repaired and restored to some  degrees of decency again; and out of the ashes of a late cathedral,  grew up into a new parochial church, in which way it was employ'd and  used ever after, untill the kings happy restauration. For Mr. Oliver  St. John, chief justice then of the common pleas, being sent on an  embassy into Holland by the powers that governed then, requested this  boon of them at his return, that they would give him the ruin'd church  or minster at Peterburgh; this they did accordingly, and he gave it to  the town of Peterburgh for their use, to be employ'd as a parochial  church, their own parish church being then very ruinous and gone to  decay.    \"Now the town considering the largeness of the building, and the  greatness of the charge to repair it, which of themselves they were not  able to defray, they all agree to pull down the ladies chapel as it was  then called, an additional building to the north side of the minster,  (being then ruinous and ready to fall) and to expose the materials  thereof, lead, timber, and stone to sale, and to convert the mony that  was made of them, towards the repairs of the great fabrick.    \"All this they did, and appointed certain persons to oversee the work,  and expended several summs thus in repairs, mending the leads, securing  the roof, glazing several windows, and then fitting up the quire, and  making it pretty decent for the congregation to meet in. And this they  did, by taking the painted boards that came off from the roof of the  ladies chapel, and placing them all along at the back of the quire, in  such manner as they continue to this day.    \"When the place was thus fitted up, and the devastations which the  souldiers had made in some measure repaired, one Mr. Samuel Wilson,  school master of the charter-house, in London, was sent down by the  committee of plundred ministers, as they were then called, to be  preacher, with a sallary of 160_l._ per an. in which employment he  continued untill the kings return. Then Dr. Cofin, the antient dean of  the church, after almost twenty years exile in France, return'd and  re-assumed his right again, in the year 1660, about the end of July. He  then after so long an interval renew'd the antient usage, and read  divine service first himself, and caused it to be read every day  afterward, according to the laudable use and custome, and settled the  church and quire in that order wherein it now continues.    \"But though the church was thus delivered from public robbers and  spoilers, yet it was not safe from the injuries of private hands. For  some ten or twelve years after, certain thieves in the dead of the  night, broke into the church and stole away all the plate they could  find, viz.: a fair silver bason gilt, and the virgers two silver rods,  and a linnen table-cloth to wrap them in, which were never heard of to  this day. This was the same bason that had been plunder'd by the  souldiers, and recovered again, but irrecoverably lost now. Yet both  these losses were soon repaired, one by Dr. Henshaw, bishop then of the  place, who gave a fair new silver basin gilt; the other made up by Dr.  Duport, then dean, who furnisht the virgers again with the ensigns of  their office, by buying two new silver maces for the churches use.    \"And thus is this history brought down at length within our own  knowledge and remembrance; where we have seen what various fortunes  this antient church has had, which now reckons at least one thousand  years from its first foundation. It has been often ruinated, and as  often re-edified. Once it was destroyed by Danes; twice consumed by  fire; it escaped the general downfal of abbies, in Hen. the Eighth's  time, though not without the loss of some of her fairest manners; and  yet what that king took away in revenues, he added to it in dignity, by  converting it from an abbey into a cathedral church. But the worst  mischief that ever befel it, was that in the late rebellious times,  when the church itself was miserably defaced and spoiled; and all the  lands for the maintenance thereof, quite alienated and sold. And yet  through Gods especial goodness and favour, we have lived to see the one  repaired, the others restored, and the church itself recovering her  antient beauty and lustre again. And that it may thus long continue,  flourish and prosper, and be a nursery for vertue, a seminary for true  religion and piety, a constant preserver of Gods publick worship and  service, and free from all sacrilegious hands, is the earnest and  hearty prayer wherewith I shall conclude this discourse.\"            [17] Sir William Fitzwilliam, of Milton, to whom the castle then        belonged, used to pay visits to the queen of Scots during her        confinement, and his noble and gentlemanly conduct, secured the        good esteem of Mary. At a later period, a little before the queen        was executed, she presented him with a picture of her son, as a        testimony of the value which she set upon his friendship. This        picture is now in the possession of the Fitzwilliam family.          [18] The original letter, in the king's own hand-writing, is        still in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Peterborough,        and has recently been placed in a frame by the entrance from the        south aisle. The following is a copy:--\"JAMES R.

Wee have commanded a Memoriall of hir to be        made in our church of Westminster, ye place where ye Kings and        Queens of this realme are usually interred. And for that wee        thinke it inconvenient that ye monument and hir body should be in        severall places, we have ordered that hir said body remayning now        interred in that our Cathedrall Church of Peterborough shalbe        removed to Westminster to hir said monument; and have committed        ye care and chardg of ye said translation of hir body from        Peterborough to Westminster to ye reverend father in God our        right trusty and wel beloved servant ye Bishop of Coventry and        Lichfield, bearer hereof, to whom wee require you (or to such as        ye shall assigne) to deliver ye corps of our said deceased        mother, ye same being taken up in a decent and respectfull manner        as is fitting.

It is a MS. account of        the History of the Abbey from its foundation. Dean Patrick gives        the following account of its singular preservation:--\"One book        indeed, and but one, still remains, which was happily redeemed        from the fire by the then precentor of the church, Mr. Humfrey        Austin, who knowing the great value of it, first hid it, in        February, 1642, under a seat in the quire: and when it was found        by a soldier on the twenty-second of April, 1643 (when all the        seats were pulled down), rescued it again by the offer of ten        shillings, 'for that old latin bible' as he called it, and about        which he pretended to enquire. The name of the bible by the help        of the ten shillings, preserved this precious treasure from the        flames, whither it was going, as Mr. Austin hath left a record in        the beginning of the book; with a copy of the soldier's        acknowledgement:--'_This booke was hide in the Church by me        Humphrey Austin; February, 1642. And found by one of Coll.        Cromwelle souldyers when they pul'd down all the seats in the        quire, April 22th, 1643. And I makeing inquirie amongst them for        an old Latin Bible which were lost, I found out at last the        partie who had it, and I gave him for the booke tenn shillings as        you see by this acquittance....

So swift, silent, and furtive were his  movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent,  that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made  had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of  exerting them in its defense.  As he hunted about, he kept muttering to  himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.    \"We are certainly in luck,\" said he.  \"We ought to have very little  trouble now.  Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the  creosote.  You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here  at the side of this evil-smelling mess.  The carboy has been cracked,  You see, and the stuff has leaked out.\"    \"What then?\" I asked.    \"Why, we have got him, that's all,\" said he.  \"I know a dog that would  follow that scent to the world's end.  If a pack can track a trailed  herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so  pungent a smell as this?  It sounds like a sum in the rule of three.  The answer should give us the--But halloo! here are the accredited  representatives of the law.\"    Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and  the hall door shut with a loud crash.    \"Before they come,\" said Holmes, \"just put your hand here on this poor  fellow's arm, and here on his leg.  What do you feel?\"    \"The muscles are as hard as a board,\" I answered.    \"Quite so.  They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding  the usual rigor mortis.  Coupled with this distortion of the face, this  Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers called it,  what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\"    \"Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\" I answered,--\"some  strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\"    \"That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn  muscles of the face.  On getting into the room I at once looked for the  means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I  discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force  into the scalp.  You observe that the part struck was that which would  be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his  chair.  Now examine the thorn.\"    I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was  long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though  some gummy substance had dried upon it.  The blunt end had been trimmed  and rounded off with a knife.    \"Is that an English thorn?\" he asked.    \"No, it certainly is not.\"    \"With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.  But here are the regulars:  so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\"    As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on  the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily  into the room.  He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of  very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen  and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform,  and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.    \"Here's a business!\" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. \"Here's a  pretty business!  But who are all these?  Why, the house seems to be as  full as a rabbit-warren!\"    \"I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\" said Holmes,  quietly.    \"Why, of course I do!\" he wheezed.  \"It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the  theorist.  Remember you!  I'll never forget how you lectured us all on  causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case.  It's  true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was more  by good luck than good guidance.\"    \"It was a piece of very simple reasoning.\"    \"Oh, come, now, come!  Never be ashamed to own up.  But what is all  this?  Bad business!  Bad business!  Stern facts here,--no room for  theories.  How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another  case!  I was at the station when the message arrived.  What d'you think  the man died of?\"    \"Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over,\" said Holmes, dryly.    \"No, no.  Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head  sometimes.  Dear me!  Door locked, I understand.  Jewels worth half a  million missing.  How was the window?\"    \"Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.\"    \"Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with  the matter.  That's common sense.  Man might have died in a fit; but  then the jewels are missing.  Ha!  I have a theory. These flashes come  upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto.  Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes?  Sholto  was, on his own confession, with his brother last night.  The brother  died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure.  How's  that?\"    \"On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on  the inside.\"    \"Hum!  There's a flaw there.  Let us apply common sense to the matter.  This Thaddeus Sholto WAS with his brother; there WAS a quarrel; so much  we know.  The brother is dead and the jewels are gone.  So much also we  know.  No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him.  His bed  had not been slept in.  Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state  of mind.  His appearance is--well, not attractive.  You see that I am  weaving my web round Thaddeus.  The net begins to close upon him.\"    \"You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\" said Holmes. \"This  splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned,  was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card,  inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this  rather curious stone-headed instrument.  How does all that fit into  your theory?\"    \"Confirms it in every respect,\" said the fat detective, pompously.  \"House is full of Indian curiosities.  Thaddeus brought this up, and if  this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use  of it as any other man.  The card is some hocus-pocus,--a blind, as  like as not.  The only question is, how did he depart?  Ah, of course,  here is a hole in the roof.\"  With great activity, considering his  bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and  immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he  had found the trap-door.    \"He can find something,\" remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \"He  has occasional glimmerings of reason.  _Il n'y a pas des sots si  incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!_\"    \"You see!\" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.  \"Facts are better than mere theories, after all.  My view of the case  is confirmed.  There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it  is partly open.\"    \"It was I who opened it.\"    \"Oh, indeed!  You did notice it, then?\"  He seemed a little crestfallen  at the discovery.  \"Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our  gentleman got away.  Inspector!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" from the passage.    \"Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform  you that anything which you may say will be used against you.  I arrest  you in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your  brother.\"    \"There, now!  Didn't I tell you!\" cried the poor little man, throwing  out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.    \"Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes.  \"I think  that I can engage to clear you of the charge.\"    \"Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!\"  snapped the detective.  \"You may find it a harder matter than you  think.\"    \"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free  present of the name and description of one of the two people who were  in this room last night.  His name, I have every reason to believe, is  Jonathan Small.  He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his  right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the  inner side.  His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron  band round the heel.  He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has  been a convict.  These few indications may be of some assistance to  you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing  from the palm of his hand.  The other man--\"    \"Ah! the other man--?\" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but  impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the  other's manner.    \"Is a rather curious person,\" said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his  heel.  \"I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair  of them.--A word with you, Watson.\"    He led me out to the head of the stair.  \"This unexpected occurrence,\"  he said, \"has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of  our journey.\"    \"I have just been thinking so,\" I answered.  \"It is not right that Miss  Morstan should remain in this stricken house.\"    \"No.  You must escort her home.  She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester,  in Lower Camberwell:  so it is not very far.  I will wait for you here  if you will drive out again.  Or perhaps you are too tired?\"    \"By no means.  I don't think I could rest until I know more of this  fantastic business.  I have seen something of the rough side of life,  but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises  to-night has shaken my nerve completely.  I should like, however, to  see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\"    \"Your presence will be of great service to me,\" he answered.  \"We shall  work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult  over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct.  When you have  dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down "]]]
