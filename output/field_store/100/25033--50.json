He drove  Sinmuballit out of Ishin, and this victory so forcibly impressed  his contemporaries, that they made it the starting-point of a new  semi-official era; twenty-eight years after the event, private contracts  still continued to be dated by reference to the taking of Ishin.  Sinmuballit's son, Khammurabi, was more fortunate. Eimsin vainly  appealed for help against him to his relative and suzerain  Kudur-lagamar, who had succeeded Simtishilkhak at Susa. Eimsin was  defeated, and disappeared from the scene of action, leaving no trace  behind him, though we may infer that he took refuge in his fief of  Yamutbal. The conquest by Khammurabi was by no means achieved at one  blow, the enemy offering an obstinate resistance. He was forced to  destroy several fortresses, the inhabitants of which had either risen  against him or had refused to do him homage, among them being those  of Meir* and Malgu. When the last revolt had been put down, all the  countries speaking the language of Chaldaea and sharing its civilization  were finally united into a single kingdom, of which Khammurabi  proclaimed himself the head. Other princes who had preceded him had  enjoyed the same opportunities, but their efforts had never been  successful in establishing an empire of any duration; the various  elements had been bound together for a moment, merely to be dispersed  again after a short interval. The work of Khammurabi, on the contrary,  was placed on a solid foundation, and remained unimpaired under his  successors. Not only did he hold sway without a rival in the south as  in the north, but the titles indicating the rights he had acquired over  Sumer and Accad were inserted in his Protocol after those denoting his  hereditary possessions,--the city of Bel and the four houses of the  world. Khammurabi's victory marks the close of those long centuries of  gradual evolution during which the peoples of the Lower Euphrates passed  from division to unity. Before his reign there had been as many states  as cities, and as many dynasties as there were states; after him there  was but one kingdom under one line of kings.         * Mairu, Meir, has been identified with Shurippak; but it       is, rather, the town of Mar, now Tell-Id. A and Lagamal, the       Elamite Lagamar, were worshipped there. It was the seat of a       linen manufacture, and possessed large shipping.    Khammurabi's long reign of fifty-five years has hitherto yielded us but  a small number of monuments--seals, heads of sceptres, alabaster vases,  and pompous inscriptions, scarcely any of them being of historical  interest. He was famous for the number of his campaigns, no details of  which, however, have come to light, but the dedication of one of his  statues celebrates his good fortune on the battlefield. \"Bel has lent  thee sovereign majesty: thou, what awaitest thou?--Sin has lent thee  royalty: thou, what awaitest thou?--Ninip has lent thee his supreme  weapon: thou, what awaitest thou?--The goddess of light, Ishtar,  has lent thee the shock of arms and the fray: thou, what awaitest  thou?--Shamash and Bamman are thy varlets: thou, what awaitest thou?--It  is Khammurabi, the king, the powerful chieftain--who cuts the enemies  in pieces,--the whirlwind of battle--who overthrows the country of the  rebels--who stays combats, who crushes rebellions,--who destroys  the stubborn like images of clay,--who overcomes the obstacles of  inaccessible mountains.\" The majority of these expeditions were, no  doubt, consequent on the victory which destroyed the power of Kimsin.  It would not have sufficed merely to drive back the Elamites beyond the  Tigris; it was necessary to strike a blow within their own territory to  avoid a recurrence of hostilities, which might have endangered the still  recent work of conquest. Here, again, Khammurabi seems to have met with  his habitual success.    [Illustration: 057.jpg HEAD OF A SCEPTRE IN COPPER, BEARING THE NAME OF  KHAM-MURABI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a rapid sketch made at the       British Museum.    Ashnunak was a border district, and shared the fate of all the provinces  on the eastern bank of the Tigris, being held sometimes by Elam and  sometimes by Chaldaea; properly speaking, it was a country of Semitic  speech, and was governed by viceroys owning allegiance, now to Babylon,  now to Susa.* Khammurabi seized this province, and permanently secured  its frontier by building along the river a line of fortresses surrounded  by earthworks. Following the example of his predecessors, he set himself  to restore and enrich the temples.         * Pognon discovered inscriptions of four of the vicegerents       of Ashnunak, which he assigns, with some hesitation, to the       time of Khammurabi, rather than to that of the kings of       Telloh. Three of these names are Semitic, the fourth       Sumerian; the language of the inscriptions bears a       resemblance to the Semitic dialect of Chaldaea.    The house of Zamama and Ninni, at Kish, was out of repair, and the  ziggurat threatened to fall; he pulled it down and rebuilt it, carrying  it to such a height that its summit \"reached the heavens.\" Merodach had  delegated to him the government of the faithful, and had raised him to  the rank of supreme ruler over the whole of Chaldaea. At Babylon, close  to the great lake which served as a reservoir for the overflow of the  Euphrates, the king restored the sanctuary of Esagilla, the dimensions  of which did not appear to him to be proportionate to the growing  importance of the city. \"He completed this divine dwelling with great  joy and delight, he raised the summit to the firmament,\" and then  enthroned Merodach and his spouse, Zarpanit, within it, amid great  festivities. He provided for the ever-recurring requirements of the  national religion by frequent gifts; the tradition has come down to us  of the granary for wheat which he built at Babylon, the sight of which  alone rejoiced the heart of the god. While surrounding Sippar with a  great wall and a fosse, to protect its earthly inhabitants, he did  not forget Shamash and Malkatu, the celestial patrons of the town. He  enlarged in their honour the mysterious Ebarra, the sacred seat of their  worship, and that which no king from the earliest times had known how  to build for his divine master, that did he generously for Shamash  his master. He restored Ezida, the eternal dwelling of Merodach,  at Borsippa; Eturka-lamma, the temple of Anu, Ninni, and Nana, the  suzerains of Kish; and also Ezikalamma, the house of the goddess Ninna,  in the village of Zarilab. In the southern provinces, but recently added  to the crown,--at Larsa, Uruk, and Uru,--he displayed similar activity.    [Illustration: 059.jpg Page Image]    He had, doubtless, a political as well as a religious motive in all he  did; for if he succeeded in winning the allegiance of the priests by  the prodigality of his pious gifts, he could count on their gratitude in  securing for him the people's obedience, and thus prevent the outbreak  of a revolt. He had, indeed, before him a difficult task in attempting  to allay the ills which had been growing during centuries of civil  discord and foreign conquest. The irrigation of the country demanded  constant attention, and from earliest times its sovereigns had directed  the work with real solicitude; but owing to the breaking up of the  country into small states, their respective resources could not be  combined in such general operations as were needed for controlling the  inundations and effectually remedying the excess or the scarcity of  water. Khammurabi witnessed the damage done to the whole province of  Umliyash by one of those terrible floods which still sometimes ravage  the regions of the Lower Tigris,* and possibly it may have been to  prevent the recurrence of such a disaster that he undertook the work of  canalization.         * Contracts dated the year of an inundation which laid waste       Umliyash; cf. in our own time, the inundation of April 10,       1831, which in a single night destroyed half the city of       Bagdad, and in which fifteen thousand persons lost their       lives either by drowning or by the collapse of their houses.    He was the first that we know of who attempted to organize and reduce  to a single system the complicated network of ditches and channels which  intersected the territory belonging to the great cities between Babylon  and the sea. Already, more than half a century previously, Siniddinam  had enlarged the canal on which Larsa was situated, while Bimsin had  provided an outlet for the \"River of the Gods\" into the Persian Gulf:*  by the junction of the two a navigable channel was formed between the  Euphrates and the marshes, and an outlet was thus made for the surplus  waters of the inundation. Khammurabi informs us how Anu and Bel, having  confided to him the government of Sumer and Accad, and having placed in  his hands the reins of power, he dug the Nar-Khammurabi, the source of  wealth to the people, which brings abundance of water to the country  of Sumir and Accad. \"I turned both its banks into cultivated ground, I  heaped up mounds of grain and I furnished perpetual water for the people  of Sumir and Accad. The country of Sumer and Accad, I gathered together  its nations who were scattered, I gave them pasture and drink, I ruled  over them in riches and abundance, I caused them to inhabit a peaceful  dwelling-place. Then it was that Khammurabi, the powerful king, the  favourite of the great gods, I myself, according to the prodigious  strength with which Merodach had endued me, I constructed a high  fortress, upon mounds of earth; its summit rises to the height of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#9)"],[1,"birth of children; her son Amenothes, on coming into  the world with his double, is placed in the hands of the two Niles, to  receive the nourishment and the education meet for the children of the  gods. He profited fully by them, for he remained in power forty years,  and his reign was one of the most prosperous ever witnessed by Egypt  during the Theban dynasties.    [Illustration: 052.jpg QUEEN MUTEMUAU.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Daniel Heron.    Amenothes III. had spent but little of his time in war. He had  undertaken the usual raids in the South against the negroes and the  tribes of the Upper Nile. In his fifth year, a general defection of the  sheikhs obliged him to invade the province of Abhait, near Semneh, which  he devastated at the head of the troops collected by Mari-ifi mosu, the  Prince of Kush; the punishment was salutary, the booty considerable, and  a lengthy peace was re-established. The object of his rare expeditions  into Naharaim was not so much to add new provinces to his empire, as to  prevent disturbances in the old ones. The kings of Alasia, of the Khati,  of Mitanni, of Singar,* of Assyria, and of Babylon did not dare to  provoke so powerful a neighbour.**         * Amenothes entitles himself on a scarabaeus \"he who takes       prisoner the country of Singar;\" no other document has yet       been discovered to show whether this is hyperbole, or       whether he really reached this distant region.         ** The lists of the time of Amenothes III. contain the names       of Phoenicia, Naharaim, Singar, Qodshu, Tunipa, Patina,       Carchomish, and Assur; that is to say, of all the subject or       allied nations mentioned in the correspondence of Tel el-       Amarna. Certain episodes of these expeditions had been       engraved on the exterior face of the pylon constructed by       the king for the temple of Amon at Karnak; at the present       time they are concealed by the wall at the lower end of the       Hypostyle Hall. The tribute of the Lotanu was represented on       the tomb of Hui, at Sheikh-Abd-el-Qurneh.    [Illustration: 052b.jpg Amenothes III. Colossal Head in the British  Museum]    [Illustration: 052b-text.jpg]    The remembrance of the victories of Thutmosis III. was still fresh in  their memories, and, even had their hands been free, would have  made them cautious in dealing with his great-grandson; but they were  incessantly engaged in internecine quarrels, and had recourse to  Pharaoh merely to enlist his support, or at any rate make sure of his  neutrality, and prevent him from joining their adversaries.    [Illustration: 053.jpg AMENOTHES III. FROM THE TOMB OF KHAMHAIT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Daniel Heron.    Whatever might have been the nature of their private sentiments, they  professed to be anxious to maintain, for their mutual interests, the  relations with Egypt entered on half a century before, and as the surest  method of attaining their object was by a good marriage, they would each  seek an Egyptian wife for himself, or would offer Amenothes a princess  of one of their own royal families. The Egyptian king was, however, firm  in refusing to bestow a princess of the solar blood even on the most  powerful of the foreign kings; his pride rebelled at the thought that  she might one day be consigned to a place among the inferior wives  or concubines, but he gladly accepted, and even sought for wives for  himself, from among the Syrian and Chaldaean princesses. Kallimmasin of  Babylon gave Amenothes first his sister, and when age had deprived this  princess of her beauty, then his daughter Irtabi in marriage.*         * Letter from Amenothes III. to Kallimmasin, concerning a       sister of the latter, who was married to the King of Egypt,       but of whom there are no further records remaining at       Babylon, and also one of his daughters whom Amenothes had       demanded in marriage; and letters from Kallimmasin,       consenting to bestow his daughter Irtabi on the Pharaoh, and       proposing to give to Amenothes whichever one he might choose       of the daughters of his house.    Sutarna of Mitanni had in the same way given the Pharaoh his daughter  Gilukhipa; indeed, most of the kings of that period had one or two  relations in the harem at Thebes. This connexion usually proved a  support to Asiatic sovereigns, such alliances being a safeguard against  the rivalries of their brothers or cousins. At times, however, they were  the means of exposing them to serious dangers. When Sutarna died he was  succeeded by his son Dushratta, but a numerous party put forward another  prince, named Artassumara, who was probably Gilukhipa's brother, on the  mother's side;* a Hittite king of the name of Pirkhi espoused the cause  of the pretender, and a civil war broke out.         * Her exact relationship is not explicitly expressed, but is       implied in the facts, for there seems no reason why       Gilukhipa should have taken the part of one brother rather       than another, unless Artassumara had been nearer to her than       Dushratta; that is to say, her brother on the mother's side       as well as on the father's.    Dushratta was victorious, and caused his brother to be strangled, but  was not without anxiety as to the consequences which might follow this  execution should Gilukhipa desire to avenge the victim, and to this end  stir up the anger of the suzerain against him. Dushratta, therefore,  wrote a humble epistle, showing that he had received provocation, and  that he had found it necessary to strike a decisive blow to save his own  life; the tablet was accompanied by various presents to the royal pair,  comprising horses, slaves, jewels, and perfumes. Gilukhipa, however,  bore Dushratta no ill-will, and the latter's anxieties were allayed.  The so-called expeditions of Amenothes to the Syrian provinces  must constantly have been merely visits of inspection, during which  amusements, and especially the chase, occupied nearly as important  a place as war and politics. Amenothes III. took to heart that  pre-eminently royal duty of ridding the country of wild beasts, and  fulfilled it more conscientiously than any of his predecessors. He had  killed 112 lions during the first ten years of his reign, and as it was  an exploit of which he was remarkably proud, he perpetuated the memory  of it in a special inscription, which he caused to be engraved on  numbers of large scarabs of fine green enamel. Egypt prospered under his  peaceful government, and if the king made no great efforts to extend  her frontiers, he spared no pains to enrich the country by developing  industry and agriculture, and also endeavoured to perfect the military  organisation which had rendered the conquest of the East so easy a  matter.    A census, undertaken by his minister Amenothes, the son of Hapi,  ensured a more correct assessment of the taxes, and a regular scheme of  recruiting for the army.    [Illustration: 056.jpg SCARAB OF THE HUNT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph published in       Mariette.    Whole tribes of slaves were brought into the country by means of the  border raids which were always taking place, and their opportune arrival  helped to fill up the vacancies which repeated wars had caused among  the rural and urban population; such a strong impetus to agriculture  was also given by this importation, that when, towards the middle of the  reign, the minister Khamhaifc presented the tax-gathers at court, he  was able to boast that he had stored in the State granaries a larger  quantity of corn than had been gathered in for thirty years. The traffic  carried on between Asia and the Delta by means of both Egyptian and  foreign ships was controlled by customhouses erected at the mouths of  the Nile, the coast being protected by cruising vessels against the  attacks of pirates. The fortresses of the isthmus and of the Libyan  border, having been restored or rebuilt, constituted a check on the  turbulence of the nomad tribes, while garrisons posted at intervals  at the entrance to the Wadys leading to the desert restrained the  plunderers scattered between the Nile and the Red Sea, and between the  chain of Oases and the unexplored regions of the Sahara.* Egypt was at  once the most powerful as well as the most prosperous kingdom in the  world, being able to command more labour and more precious metals for  the embellishment of her towns and the construction of her monuments  than any other.         All this information is gathered from the inscription on the            statue of Amenothes, the son of Hapi.    Public works had been carried on briskly under Thutmosis III. and his  successors. The taste for building, thwarted at first by the necessity  of financial reforms, and then by that of defraying the heavy expenses  incurred through the expulsion of the Hyksos and the earlier foreign  wars, had free scope as soon as spoil from the Syrian victories began to  pour in year by year. While the treasure seized from the enemy provided  the money, the majority of the prisoners were used as workmen, so that  temples, palaces, and citadels began to rise as if by magic from one end  of the valley to the other.*         * For this use of prisoners of war, cf. the picture from the       tomb of Rakhmiri on p. 58 of the present work, in which most       of the earlier Egyptologists believed they recognised the       Hebrews, condemned by Pharaoh to build the cities of Ramses       and Pithom in the Delta.    Nubia, divided into provinces, formed merely an extension of the  ancient feudal Egypt--at any rate as far as the neighbourhood of the  Tacazzeh--though the Egyptian religion had here assumed a peculiar  character.
