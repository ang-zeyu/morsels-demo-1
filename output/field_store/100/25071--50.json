[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18184"],[0,"Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley (#9)"],[1," and the  interpretations given to ancient works of art by the erring pencil of  the modern artist are responsible for many an ingenious theory which the  original would never have suggested. It may well be that future  investigations will show that the one peculiarity which distinguishes  the so-called Elephant Mound from its fellows is really susceptible of a  much more commonplace explanation than has hitherto been given it.    Even if such explanation be not forthcoming, the \"Elephant Mound\" of  Wisconsin should be supplemented by a very considerable amount of  corroborative testimony before being accepted as proof positive of the  acquaintance of the Mound-Builders with the mastodon.    As regards likeness to the mastodon, the pipes before alluded to, copies  of which as given in Barber's articles on Mound Pipes in American  Naturalist for April, 1882, Figs. 17 and 18, are here presented, while  not entirely above criticism, are much nearer what they have been  supposed to be than the mound just mentioned.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Elephant Pipe, Iowa]    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Elephant Pipe, Iowa.]    Of the two, figure 29 is certainly the most natural in appearance, but,  if the pipes are intentional imitations of any animal, neither can be  regarded as having been intended for any other than the mastodon. Yet,  as pointed out by Barber and others, it is certainly surprising that if  intended for mastodons no attempt was made to indicate the tusks, which  with the trunk constitute the most marked external peculiarities of all  the elephant kind. The tusks, too, as affording that most important  product in primitive industries, ivory, would naturally be the one  peculiarity of all others which the ancient artist would have relied  upon to fix the identity of the animal. It is also remarkable that in  neither of these pipes is the tail indicated, although a glance at the  other sculptures will show that in the full-length figures this member  is invariably shown. In respect to these omissions, the pipes from Iowa  are strikingly suggestive of the Elephant Mound of Wisconsin, with the  peculiarities of which the sculptor, whether ancient or modern, might  almost be supposed to have been acquainted. It certainly must be looked  upon as a curious coincidence that carvings found at a point so remote  from the Elephant Mound, and presumably the work of other hands, should  so closely copy the imperfections of that mound.    In considering the evidence afforded by these pipes of a knowledge of  the mastodon on the part of the Mound-Builders, it should be borne in  mind that their authenticity as specimens of the Mound-Builders' art has  been called seriously in question. Possibly the fact that the same  person was instrumental in bringing to light both the pipes has had  largely to do with the suspicion, especially when it was remembered that  although explorers have been remarkably active in the same region, it  has fallen to the good fortune of no one else to find anything conveying  the most distant suggestion of the mastodon. As the manner of discovery  of such relics always forms an important part of their history, the  following account of the pipes as communicated to Mr. Barber by Mr.  W. H. Pratt, president of the Davenport Academy (American Naturalist for  April, 1882, pp. 275, 276), is here subjoined:         The first elephant pipe, which we obtained (Fig. 17) a little more       than a year ago, was found some six years before by an illiterate       German farmer named Peter Mare, while planting corn on a farm in       the mound region, Louisa County, Iowa. He did not care whether it       was elephant or kangaroo; to him it was a curious 'Indian stone,'       and nothing more, and he kept it and smoked it. In 1878 he removed       to Kansas, and when he left he gave the pipe to his brother-in-law,       a farm laborer, who also smoked it. Mr. Gass happened to hear of       it, as he is always inquiring about such things, hunted up the man       and borrowed the pipe to take photographs and casts from it. He       could not buy it. The man said his brother-in-law gave it to him       and as it was a curious thing--he wanted to keep it. We were,       however, unfortunate, or fortunate, enough to break it; that       spoiled it for him and that was his chance to make some money out       of it. He could have claimed any amount, and we would, as in duty       bound, have raised it for him, but he was satisfied with three or       four dollars. During the first week in April, this month, Rev. Ad.       Blumer, another German Lutheran minister, now of Genesee, Illinois,       having formerly resided in Louisa County, went down there in       company with Mr. Gass to open a few mounds, Mr. Blumer being well       acquainted there. They carefully explored ten of them, and found       nothing but ashes and decayed bones in any, except one. In that one       was a layer of red, hard-burned clay, about five feet across and       thirteen inches in thickness at the center, which rested upon a bed       of ashes one foot in depth in the middle, the ashes resting upon       the natural undisturbed clay. In the ashes, near the bottom of the       layer, they found a part of a broken carved stone pipe,       representing some bird; a very small beautifully formed copper       'axe,' and this last elephant pipe (Fig. 18). This pipe was first       discovered by Mr. Blumer, and by him, at our earnest solicitation,       turned over to the Academy.    It will be seen from the above that the same gentleman was instrumental  in bringing to light the two specimens constituting the present supply  of elephant pipes.    The remarkable archaeologic instinct which has guided the finder of these  pipes has led him to even more important discoveries. By the aid of his  divining rod he has succeeded in unearthing some of the most remarkable  inscribed tablets which have thus far rewarded the diligent search of  the mound explorer. It is not necessary to speak in detail of these  here, or of the various theories to which they have given rise and  support, including that of phonetic writing, further than to call  attention to the fact that by a curious coincidence one of the tablets  contains, among a number of familiar animals, figures which suggest in a  rude way the mastodon again, which animal indeed some archaeologists have  confidently asserted them to be. The resemblance they bear to that  animal is, however, by no means as close as exhibited by the pipe  carvings; they are therefore not reproduced here. Both figures differ  from the pipes in having tails; both lack trunks, and also tusks.    Archaeologists must certainly deem it unfortunate that outside of the  Wisconsin mound the only evidence of the co-existence of the  Mound-Builder and the mastodon should reach the scientific world through  the agency of one individual. So derived, each succeeding carving of the  mastodon, be it more or less accurate, instead of being accepted by  archaeologists as cumulative evidence tending to establish the  genuineness of the sculptured testimony showing that the Mound-Builder  and mastodon were coeval, will be viewed with ever increasing suspicion.    This part of the subject should not be concluded without allusion to a  certain class of evidence, which, although of a negative sort, must be  accorded very great weight in considering this much vexed question. It  may be asked why if the Mound-Builders and the mastodon were  contemporaneous, have no traces of the ivory tusks ever been exhumed  from the mounds? No material is so perfectly adapted for the purposes of  carving, an art to which we have seen the Mound-Builders were much  addicted, as ivory, both from its beauty and the ease with which it is  worked, to say nothing of the other manifold uses to which it is put,  both by primitive and civilized man. The mastodon affords an abundant  supply of this highly prized substance, not a particle of which has ever  been exhumed from the mounds either in the shape of implements or  carving. Yet the exceedingly close texture of ivory enables it to  successfully resist the destroying influences of time for very long  periods--very long indeed as compared with certain articles which  commonly reward the search of the mound explorer.    Among the articles of a perishable nature that have been exhumed from  the mounds are large numbers of shell ornaments, which are by no means  very durable, as well as the perforated teeth of various animals;  sections of deers' horns have also been found, as well as ornaments made  of the claws of animals, a still more perishable material. The list also  includes the bones of the muskrat and turtle, as of other animals, not  only in their natural shape, but carved into the form of implements of  small size, as awls, etc. Human bones, too, in abundance, have been  exhumed in a sufficiently well preserved state to afford a basis for  various theories and speculations.    But of the mastodon, with which these dead Mound-Builders are supposed  to have been acquainted, not a palpable trace remains. The tale of its  existence is told by a single mound in Wisconsin, which the most ardent  supporter of the mastodon theory must acknowledge to be far from a  facsimile, and two carvings and an inscribed tablet, the three latter  the finds of a single explorer.    Bearing in mind the many attempts at archaeological frauds that recent  years have brought to light, archaeologists have a right to demand that  objects which afford a basis for such important deductions as the coeval  life of the Mound-Builder and the mastodon, should be above the  slightest suspicion not only in respect to their resemblances, but as  regards the circumstances of discovery. If they are not above suspicion,  the science of archaeology can better afford to wait for further and more  certain evidence than to commit itself to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18187"],[0,"Hebrew Life and Times (#9)"],[1,"                             |   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+    How quickly a modern boy would have contrived a different arrangement,  with a belt and foot-tread like the one on our mother's sewing  machine! But for those days the ancient wheel was ingenious. Many  different kinds of Hebrew pottery are found in the excavations: large  jars, small cups, lamps of all sizes and shapes and even babies'  rattles.    =How Hebrew boys learned a trade.=--The youngsters from the desert had  never seen any of these interesting crafts, except perhaps now and  then when their fathers had brought them with the wool to market. But  now, on a rainy day when there was no work to be done in the field or  at home, the boys would go down the street to the blacksmith shop, or  to the shed where the old Canaanite potter worked his clay. One of the  older boys would say, \"Let me see if I can make something,\" and if the  old man was good-natured he would let him try and perhaps would teach  him some of the tricks of the trade. By and by the boy would hire out  as a potter's helper and in a year or two would set up a little  pottery of his own.    So there came to be Hebrew as well as Canaanite potters and  blacksmiths. They were proud of their skill in these arts, and as a  nation they never were foolish enough to look down on them or to  despise those who practiced them. All work was looked on as honorable.  The apostle Paul was a tent-maker. Jesus was a carpenter. And in this  respect for honest and useful work we may see another reason why the  people of Israel have played so remarkable a part in the life of  humanity.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Explain the following Scripture passage in the light of the  customs described in this chapter. Isaiah 22. 22; Deuteronomy 22. 8.    2. In earlier chapters we have seen how the Hebrew leaders drew  lessons about God from shepherd life (Psalm 23), and from farm life  (Isaiah 5. 1-7). What lesson did a great prophet learn in regard to  God from the experiences of an artisan? (Jeremiah 18. 1-6.)    3. Why was it necessary to build a tower in a Canaanite vineyard, as  suggested in Isaiah 5. 2 and Mark 12. 1?      FOOTNOTES:    [3] Amos 5. 19.          CHAPTER IX    KEEPING HOUSE INSTEAD OF CAMPING OUT      Let us suppose that we have been invited to spend a day or two as  guests in the home of one of these Hebrew families who have just  settled in Canaan and begun to learn the new arts and customs of the  land. It is one of the poorer homes. We have slept through the night  on our mat spread on the dirt floor of the house, with our cloak over  us to keep us warm. Before daylight we are awakened by the older  people moving about in the dim light of the burning wick in the saucer  of oil. Soon everyone is awake. The mats are rolled up and piled in a  corner. In the early dawn one of the older girls takes a jar on her  shoulder and goes for water to the spring, which is outside the  village half way up the hill.    If we are expecting to be called to breakfast, we shall be  disappointed. There is no regular morning meal, although everyone  helps himself to a bite or two of bread from the bread basket in the  corner of the room. By and by father and the older boys take the ox  and the ass from the shed just back of the one-roomed house (we are  lucky if the animals were not kept all night in the house itself) and  start for the field. And the women also have their day's work before  them in the house. First of all, there is a bag of wheat to be ground  into flour.      HOME TASKS    In the desert the wheat or barley, when they had it, was merely  pounded between two rough stones such as could be picked up anywhere.  The flour, or meal, which was made in this way was not very good.  Here in Canaan, each house had a rude stone hand-mill for grinding  grain. It consists of a large lower stone with a saddle-shaped hollow  on the upper side. The upper stone is somewhat like a large, very  heavy rolling pin. The grain is poured into the hollow and the upper  stone is rolled back and forth over it while the flour gradually sifts  out over the sides on to the cloth which is spread on the ground  underneath the mill. It is a monotonous task, and very often two  people work it together, one feeding in the grain and the other  turning the millstone. This is pleasanter, as each worker is \"company\"  for the other. Perhaps our hostess will let us roll the millstone for  her while she feeds in the grain and sweeps up the flour from the  cloth on the ground.    =Baking bread.=--After the wheat is ground into flour there is bread  to be baked. On the plains they do not use much yeast-bread, for this  requires an oven for baking and one cannot carry heavy ovens from camp  to camp. But in Canaan each family has its oven. It is made of baked  clay and looks like a section of tiling standing on end, about two  feet high, the clay being about an inch and a half thick. There is a  cover of the same material. Sometimes the fire is made on the inside  and the loaves of dough plastered on the outside. More often the  loaves are placed on a baking tray, let down on the inside of the  oven, and the fire built all around and over it outside.    All sorts of fuel are used. Wood is the best, of course, but in that  land wood has always been scarce. In the times of the Hebrews, as  to-day, dried manure, straw, and all sorts of refuse were used. Jesus  speaks of the grass of the field, \"which to-day is, and to-morrow is  cast into the oven.\"    =Baking day.=--To-day, while we are visiting, our Hebrew hostess is  kneading some dough. She \"set it\" last night, pouring in some liquid  yeast. By and by it is ready for baking. A tray of small loaves about  the size of biscuits is placed in the oven, and a great pile of dried  grass placed around the sides and over the cover. By and by the fire  is lighted from some coals on the hearth; and in a few moments the  house is filled with smoke. We all go out on the street until the oven  is heated and the smoke has escaped.      WEAVING WOOL AND FLAX    Another household utensil which Hebrew women learned to use in Canaan  was the heavy loom. This consisted of a low horizontal frame, with a  device for separating the odd and even threads of the \"warp\" while a  shuttle was drawn through them, carrying the yarn for the \"web,\" or  the cross threads. With this kind of a loom it was possible to weave  much more rapidly than when one had to insert each thread, plaiting it  over and under, by hand. There is, no doubt, one of these looms in the  house where we are visiting.    =Making linen out of flax.=--In the desert almost all garments were  made of wool, especially in the case of the poorer tribes, who could  not afford to buy linen. In those days the use of cotton was probably  unknown. Now everyone knows how it feels to wear a flannel shirt on a  hot summer day. And one of the things which drew the Hebrew shepherds  to Canaan was the hope of raising a little flax on each farm, and  spinning it into cool, soft linen garments for the hot summers. So it  may be that a part of the work in the house we are visiting to-day is  to soak some of the stalks of flax in water, or to beat out from them  the long fibers, or to spin and weave some of these fibers into  cloth.      PREPARING DINNER    Of course the main business of each day in the household then, as now,  is to get dinner ready. There is a light lunch about noon for the  women and children. To-day perhaps we have some bread and milk. But as  the sun begins to sink in the west we know that before long the men  folks will come home hungry. We must have dinner ready for them when  they come. If it has been a good year, even poor families in Canaan  can have a fairly good meal. There is no meat, unless perhaps a lamb  or a kid has been killed, especially for us as guests. But there is  the curdled milk, and bread with olive oil and other things which  shepherd folk never have. Here's a steaming kettle of beans or  lentils. How good they smell! And here are some bunches of raisins and  figs, just as sweet and luscious as those which we buy in the fruit  stores in America. The figs in our stores may have come from that very  country of which we are studying.    =Serving the meal.=--Soon the father and the boys come home. The ox  and the ass are fed in the stall behind the house. The mother spreads  a cloth on the ground and on it places a small stand about eight  inches high, which is their only dining-room table. The pot of beans  is placed on this stand, and the bread and other good things on the  cloth around it. We all sit down on the ground and begin to eat.    Fingers were made before forks. For the beans, however, we need a  spoon, and here are some shells from the beach that serve admirably  for that purpose; and we all dip into the same dish on the little  stand. By and by, when all is gone but the liquid, we sop that up  with pieces of bread. When every crumb is picked up and eaten, we all  lift our eyes to heaven, and the father repeats a prayer of  thanksgiving to God. Dinner is over. The sun has set. It is growing  dark, and soon it will be time to go to bed.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Explain the following Scripture passages in the light of this  chapter:    Judges 16. 13; Deuteronomy 24. 6; Matthew 24. 41.    2. Read Proverbs 31. 10-31 for another picture of daily life in an  ancient Hebrew home. What is said in this chapter about the making of  beautiful as well as necessary things, and about the doing of kindly  deeds?          CHAPTER X    MORAL VICTORIES IN CANAAN      On the whole, Canaan was a good school for the Hebrew shepherds. New  arts to learn, new crops to raise, new kinds of cloth to spin and  weave, new kinds of food to cook--all this helped to make life more  interesting and worth while. But there were other lessons which  newcomers might learn which were not so wholesome."]]]
