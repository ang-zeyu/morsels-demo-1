Twelve barons were selected from among the king's ministers; twelve more  were chosen by parliament: to these twenty-four unlimited authority was  granted to reform the state; and the king himself took an oath, that he  would maintain whatever ordinances they should think proper to enact for  that purpose.[**] Leicester was at the head of this supreme council,  to which the legislative power was thus in reality transferred; and all  their measures were taken by his secret influence and direction.         * Annal.

Their first step bore a specious appearance, and seemed well calculated  for the end which they professed to be the object of all these  innovations; they ordered that four knights should be chosen by each  county; that they should make inquiry into the grievances of which  their neighborhood had reason to complain, and should attend the ensuing  parliament, in order to give information to that assembly of the state  of their particular counties;[*] a nearer approach to our present  constitution than had been made by the barons in the reign of King John,  when the knights were only appointed to meet in their several counties,  and there to draw up a detail of their grievances. Meanwhile the  twenty-four barons proceeded to enact some regulations, as a redress  of such grievances as were supposed to be sufficiently notorious. They  ordered, that three sessions of parliament should be regularly held  every year, in the months of February, June, and October; \"that a new  sheriff should be annually elected by the votes of the freeholders in  each county;[**] that the sheriffs should have no power of fining  the barons who did not attend their courts, or the circuits of the  justiciaries; that no heirs should be committed to the wardship of  foreigners, and no castles intrusted to their custody; and that no new  warrens or forests should be created, nor the revenues of any counties  or hundreds be let to farm.\" Such were the regulations which the  twenty-four barons established at Oxford, for the redress of public  grievances.         * M. Paris, p. 657. Addit. p. 140. Ann. Burt, p, 412.         ** Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 336.    But the earl of Leicester and his associates, having advanced so far  to satisfy the nation, instead of continuing in this popular course, or  granting the king that supply which they had promised him, immediately  provided for the extension and continuance of their own authority.  They roused anew the popular clamor which had long prevailed against  foreigners; and they fell with the utmost violence on the king's  half brothers, who were supposed to be the authors of, all national  grievances, and whom Henry had no longer any power to protect. The four  brothers, sensible of their danger, took to flight, with an intention of  making their escape out of the kingdom; they were eagerly pursued by the  barons; Aymer, one of the brothers, who had been elected to the see of  Winchester took shelter in his episcopal palace, and carried the others  along with him; they were surrounded in that place, and threatened to  be dragged out by force, and to be punished for their crimes and  misdemeanors; and the king, pleading the sacredness of an ecclesiastical  sanctuary, was glad to extricate them from this danger by banishing  them the kingdom. In this act of violence, as well as in the former  usurpations of the barons, the queen and her uncles were thought to  have secretly concurred; being jealous of the credit acquired by the  brothers, which, they found, had eclipsed and annihilated their own.    But the subsequent proceedings of the twenty-four barons were sufficient  to open the eyes of the nation, and to prove their intention of reducing  forever both the king and the people under the arbitrary power of a  very narrow aristocracy., which must at last have terminated either in  anarchy, or in a violent usurpation and tyranny. They pretended  that they had not yet digested all the regulations necessary for the  reformation of the state, and for the redress of grievances; and  that they must still retain their power, till that great purpose  were thoroughly effected: in other words, that they must be perpetual  governors, and must continue to reform, till they were pleased to  abdicate their authority. They formed an association among themselves,  and swore that they would stand by each other with their lives and  fortunes; they displaced all the chief officers of the crown, the  justiciary, the chancellor, the treasurer; and advanced either  themselves or their own creatures in their place: even the offices of  the king's household were disposed of at their pleasure: the government  of all the castles was put into hands in whom they found reason to  confide: and the whole power of the state being thus transferred to  them, they ventured to impose an oath, by which all the subjects were  obliged to swear, under the penalty of being declared public enemies,  that they would obey and execute all the regulations, both known and  unknown, of the twenty-four barons: and all this, for the greater  glory of God, the honor of the church, the service of the king, and the  advantage of the kingdom.[*]         * Chron. T. Wykes, p. 52.    No one dared to withstand this tyrannical authority: Prince Edward  himself, the king's eldest son, a youth of eighteen, who began to give  indications of that great and manly spirit which appeared throughout the  whole course of his life, was, after making some opposition, constrained  to take that oath, which really deposed his father and his family from  sovereign authority.[*] Earl Warrenne was the last person in the kingdom  that could be brought to give the confederated barons this mark of  submission.    But the twenty-four barons, not content with the usurpation of the royal  power, introduced an innovation in the constitution of parliament, which  was of the utmost importance. They ordained, that this assembly should  choose a committee of twelve persons, who should, in the intervals of  the sessions, possess the authority of the whole parliament, and should  attend, on a summons, the person of the king, in all his motions. But so  powerful were these barons, that this regulation was also submitted to;  the whole government was overthrown or fixed on new foundations; and the  monarchy was totally subverted, without its being possible for the king  to strike a single stroke in defence of the constitution against the  newly-erected oligarchy.    {1259.} The report that the king of the Romans intended to pay a visit  to England, gave alarm to the ruling barons, who dreaded lest the  extensive influence and established authority of that prince would be  employed to restore the prerogatives of his family, and overturn their  plan of government.[**] They sent over the bishop of Worcester, who met  him at St. Omars; asked him, in the name of the barons, the reason of  his journey, and how long he intended to stay in England; and insisted  that, before he entered the kingdom he should swear to observe the  regulations established at Oxford. On Richard's refusal to take this  oath, they prepared to resist him as a public enemy; they fitted out a  fleet, assembled an army, and exciting the inveterate prejudices of  the people against foreigners, from whom they had suffered so many  oppressions, spread the report that Richard, attended by a number  of strangers, meant to restore by force the authority of his exiled  brothers, and to violate all the securities provided for public liberty.  The king of the Romans was at last obliged to submit to the terms  required of him. [***]         * Ann. Burt. p. 411.         ** M. Paris, p. 661.         *** Ibid p. 661, 662. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53.    But the barons, in proportion to their continuance in power, began  gradually to lose that popularity which had assisted them in obtaining  it; and men repined, that regulations, which were occasionally  established for the reformation of the state, were likely to become  perpetual, and to subvert entirely the ancient constitution. They were  apprehensive lest the power of the nobles, always oppressive, should now  exert itself without control, by removing the counterpoise of the crown;  and their fears were increased by some new edicts of the barons, which  were plainly calculated to procure to themselves an impunity in all  their violences. They appointed that the circuits of the itinerant  justices, the sole check on their arbitrary conduct, should be held only  once in seven years, and men easily saw that a remedy which returned  after such long intervals, against an oppressive power which was  perpetual, would prove totally insignificant and useless.[*] The cry  became loud in the nation, that the barons should finish their intended  regulations. The knights of the shires, who seem now to have been  pretty regularly assembled, and sometimes in a separate house,  made remonstrances against the slowness of their proceedings. They  represented that, though the king had performed all the conditions  required of him, the barons had hitherto done nothing for the public  good, and had only been careful to promote their own private advantage,  and to make inroads on royal authority; and they even appealed to Prince  Edward, and claimed his interposition for the interests of the nation,  and the reformation of the government.[**] The prince replied that,  though it was from constraint, and contrary to his private sentiments,  he had sworn to maintain the provisions of Oxford, he was determined to  observe his oath: but he sent a message to the barons, requiring them  to bring their undertaking to a speedy conclusion, and fulfil their  engagements to the public: otherwise, he menaced them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#9)"],[1,"ncess, whom he had  espoused; he was affronted in the person of his daughter Margaret, who  was sent back to him, after she had been treated during some years as  queen of France; he had reason to reproach himself with his own supine  security, in neglecting the consummation of his marriage, which was  easily practicable for him, and which would have rendered the tie  indissoluble: these considerations threw him into the most violent rage,  which he vented in very indecent expressions; and he threatened France  with an invasion from the united arms of Austria, Spain, and England.    The king of England had also just reason to reproach himself with  misconduct in this important transaction; and though the affair had  terminated in a manner which he could not precisely foresee, his  negligence, in leaving his most useful ally so long exposed to the  invasion of superior power, could not but appear on reflection the  result of timid caution and narrow politics. As he valued himself on his  extensive foresight and profound judgment, the ascendant acquired over  him by a raw youth, such as Charles, could not but give him the highest  displeasure, and prompt him to seek vengeance, after all remedy for  his miscarriage was become absolutely impracticable. But he was further  actuated by avarice, a motive still more predominant with him  than either pride or revenge; and he sought, even from his present  disappointments, the gratification of this ruling passion. On pretence  of a French war, he issued a commission for levying a \"benevolence\"  on his people;[*] a species of taxation which had been abolished by a  recent law of Richard III.         * Rymer, vol. xii. p. 446. Bacon says that the benevolence       was levied with consent of parliament, which is a mistake.    This violence (for such it really was) fell chiefly on the commercial  part of the nation, who were possessed of the ready money. London  alone contributed to the amount of near ten thousand pounds. Archbishop  Morton, the chancellor, instructed the commissioners to employ a  dilemma, in which every one might be comprehended: if the persons  applied to lived frugally, they were told that their parsimony must  necessarily have enriched them; if their method of living were splendid  and hospitable, they were concluded to be opulent on account of their  expenses. This device was by some called Chancellor Morton's fork, by  others his crutch.    So little apprehensive was the king of a parliament on account of his  levying this arbitrary imposition, that he soon after summoned that  assembly to meet at Westminster; and he even expected to enrich himself  further by working on their passions and prejudices. He knew the  displeasure which the English had conceived against France on account of  the acquisition of Brittany; and he took care to insist on that topic,  in the speech which he himself pronounced to the parliament. He told  them, that France, elated with her late successes, had even proceeded to  a contempt of England, and had refused to pay the tribute which Lewis XI  had stipulated to Edward IV.: that it became so warlike a nation as  the English to be roused by this indignity, and not to limit their  pretensions merely to repelling the present injury: that, for his part,  he was determined to lay claim to the crown itself of France, and to  maintain by force of arms so just a title, transmitted to him by his  gallant ancestors: that Crecy, Poictiers, and Azincour were sufficient  to instruct them in their superiority over the enemy; nor did he despair  of adding new names to the glorious catalogue; that a king of France  had been prisoner in London, and a king of England had been crowned at  Paris; events which should animate them to an emulation of like glory  with that which had been enjoyed by their forefathers: that the domestic  dissensions of England had been the sole cause of her losing these  foreign dominions; and her present internal union would be the effectual  means of recovering them: that where such lasting honor was in view, and  such an important acquisition, it became not brave men to repine at the  advance of a little treasure: and that, for his part, he was determined  to make the war maintain itself; and hoped by the invasion of so opulent  a kingdom as France, to increase rather than diminish the riches of the  nation.[*]         * Bacon, p. 601.    Notwithstanding these magnificent vaunts of the king, all men of  penetration concluded, from the personal character of the man, and still  more from the situation of affairs, that he had no serious intention of  pushing the war to such extremities as he pretended. France was not now  in the same condition as when such successful inroads had been made  upon her by former kings of England. The great fiefs were united to  the crown; the princes of the blood were desirous of tranquillity; the  nation abounded with able captains and veteran soldiers; and the general  aspect of her affairs seemed rather to threaten her neighbors, than to  promise them any considerable advantages against her. The levity and  vain-glory of Maximilian were supported by his pompous titles; but  were ill seconded by military power, and still less by any revenue  proportioned to them. The politic Ferdinand, while he made a show of  war, was actually negotiating for peace; and rather than expose himself  to any hazard, would accept of very moderate concessions from France.  Even England was not free from domestic discontents; and in Scotland,  the death of Henry's friend and ally, James III., who had been murdered  by his rebellious subjects, had made way for the succession of his son,  James IV., who was devoted to the French interest, and would surely be  alarmed at any important progress of the English arms. But all these  obvious considerations had no influence on the parliament. Inflamed by  the ideas of subduing France, and of enriching themselves by the spoils  of that kingdom, they gave into the snare prepared for them, and voted  the supply which the king demanded. Two fifteenths were granted him; and  the better to enable his vassals and nobility to attend him, an act was  passed, empowering them to sell their estates, without paying any fines  for alienation.    {1492.} The nobility were universally seized with a desire of military  glory; and having credulously swallowed all the boasts of the king, they  dreamed of no less than carrying their triumphant banners to the  gates of Paris, and putting the crown of France on the head of their  sovereign. Many of them borrowed large sums, or sold off manors, that  they might appear in the field with greater splendor, and lead out their  followers in more complete order. The king crossed the sea, and arrived  at Calais on the sixth of October, with an army of twenty-five thousand  foot and sixteen hundred horse, which he put under the command of the  duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford: but as some inferred, from  his opening the campaign in so late a season, that peace would soon be  concluded between the crowns, he was desirous of suggesting a contrary  inference. \"He had come over,\" he said, \"to make an entire conquest of  France, which was not the work of one summer. It was therefore of no  consequence at what season he began the invasion; especially as he had  Calais ready for winter quarters.\" As if he had seriously intended this  enterprise, he instantly marched into the enemy's country, and laid  siege to Boulogne: but notwithstanding this appearance of hostility,  there had been secret advances made towards peace above three months  before; and commissioners had been appointed to treat of the terms. The  better to reconcile the minds of men to this unexpected measure, the  king's ambassadors arrived in the camp from the Low Countries, and  informed him, that Maximilian was in no readiness to join him; nor was  any assistance to be expected from that quarter. Soon after, messengers  came from Spain, and brought news of a peace concluded between that  kingdom and France, in which Charles had made a cession of the counties  of Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand. Though these articles of  intelligence were carefully dispersed throughout the army, the king was  still apprehensive lest a sudden peace, after such magnificent promises  and high expectations, might expose him to reproach. In order the more  effectually to cover the intended measures, he secretly engaged the  marquis of Dorset, together with twenty-three persons of distinction,  to present him a petition for agreeing to a treaty with France. The  pretence was founded on the late season of the year, the difficulty of  supplying the army at Calais during winter, the obstacles which arose  in the siege of Boulogne, the desertion of those allies whose assistance  had been most relied on: events which might, all of them, have been  foreseen before the embarkation of the forces.    In consequence of these preparatory steps, the bishop of Exeter and Lord  Daubeney were sent to confer at Estaples with the mareschal de Cordes,  and to put the last hand to the treaty. A few days sufficed for that  purpose: the demands of Henry were wholly pecuniary; and the king of  Franco, who deemed the peaceable possession of Brittany an equivalent  for any sum, and who was all on fire for his projected expedition into  Italy, readily agreed to the proposals made him. He engaged to pay Henry  seven hundred and forty-five thousand crowns, near four hundred thousand  pounds sterling of our present money; partly as a reimbursement of  the sums advanced to Brittany, partly as arrears of the pension due to  Edward IV. And he stipulated a yearly pension to Henry and his heirs  of twenty-five thousand crowns. Thus the king, as remarked by his  historian, made profit upon his subjects for the war, and upon his  enemies for the peace.[*] And the people agreed that he had fulfilled  his promise, when he said to"]]]
