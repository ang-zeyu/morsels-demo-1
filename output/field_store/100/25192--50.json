Although it would next be in order to explain the proper proportions and  symmetry of temples and public buildings, as well as of private houses,  I thought best to postpone this until after I had treated the practical  merits of the materials out of which, when they are brought together,  buildings are constructed with due regard to the proper kind of material  for each part, and until I had shown of what natural elements those  materials are composed. But before beginning to explain their natural  properties, I will prefix the motives which originally gave rise to  buildings and the development of inventions in this field, following in  the steps of early nature and of those writers who have devoted  treatises to the origins of civilization and the investigation of  inventions. My exposition will, therefore, follow the instruction which  I have received from them.          CHAPTER I    THE ORIGIN OF THE DWELLING HOUSE      1. The men of old were born like the wild beasts, in woods, caves, and  groves, and lived on savage fare. As time went on, the thickly crowded  trees in a certain place, tossed by storms and winds, and rubbing their  branches against one another, caught fire, and so the inhabitants of the  place were put to flight, being terrified by the furious flame. After it  subsided, they drew near, and observing that they were very comfortable  standing before the warm fire, they put on logs and, while thus keeping  it alive, brought up other people to it, showing them by signs how much  comfort they got from it. In that gathering of men, at a time when  utterance of sound was purely individual, from daily habits they fixed  upon articulate words just as these had happened to come; then, from  indicating by name things in common use, the result was that in this  chance way they began to talk, and thus originated conversation with one  another.    2. Therefore it was the discovery of fire that originally gave rise to  the coming together of men, to the deliberative assembly, and to social  intercourse. And so, as they kept coming together in greater numbers  into one place, finding themselves naturally gifted beyond the other  animals in not being obliged to walk with faces to the ground, but  upright and gazing upon the splendour of the starry firmament, and also  in being able to do with ease whatever they chose with their hands and  fingers, they began in that first assembly to construct shelters. Some  made them of green boughs, others dug caves on mountain sides, and some,  in imitation of the nests of swallows and the way they built, made  places of refuge out of mud and twigs. Next, by observing the shelters  of others and adding new details to their own inceptions, they  constructed better and better kinds of huts as time went on.    3. And since they were of an imitative and teachable nature, they would  daily point out to each other the results of their building, boasting of  the novelties in it; and thus, with their natural gifts sharpened by  emulation, their standards improved daily. At first they set up forked  stakes connected by twigs and covered these walls with mud. Others made  walls of lumps of dried mud, covering them with reeds and leaves to keep  out the rain and the heat. Finding that such roofs could not stand the  rain during the storms of winter, they built them with peaks daubed with  mud, the roofs sloping and projecting so as to carry off the rain water.    4. That houses originated as I have written above, we can see for  ourselves from the buildings that are to this day constructed of like  materials by foreign tribes: for instance, in Gaul, Spain, Portugal, and  Aquitaine, roofed with oak shingles or thatched. Among the Colchians in  Pontus, where there are forests in plenty, they lay down entire trees  flat on the ground to the right and the left, leaving between them a  space to suit the length of the trees, and then place above these  another pair of trees, resting on the ends of the former and at right  angles with them. These four trees enclose the space for the dwelling.  Then upon these they place sticks of timber, one after the other on the  four sides, crossing each other at the angles, and so, proceeding with  their walls of trees laid perpendicularly above the lowest, they build  up high towers. The interstices, which are left on account of the  thickness of the building material, are stopped up with chips and mud.  As for the roofs, by cutting away the ends of the crossbeams and making  them converge gradually as they lay them across, they bring them up to  the top from the four sides in the shape of a pyramid. They cover it  with leaves and mud, and thus construct the roofs of their towers in a  rude form of the \"tortoise\" style.    5. On the other hand, the Phrygians, who live in an open country, have  no forests and consequently lack timber. They therefore select a natural  hillock, run a trench through the middle of it, dig passages, and extend  the interior space as widely as the site admits. Over it they build a  pyramidal roof of logs fastened together, and this they cover with reeds  and brushwood, heaping up very high mounds of earth above their  dwellings. Thus their fashion in houses makes their winters very warm  and their summers very cool. Some construct hovels with roofs of rushes  from the swamps. Among other nations, also, in some places there are  huts of the same or a similar method of construction. Likewise at  Marseilles we can see roofs without tiles, made of earth mixed with  straw. In Athens on the Areopagus there is to this day a relic of  antiquity with a mud roof. The hut of Romulus on the Capitol is a  significant reminder of the fashions of old times, and likewise the  thatched roofs of temples or the Citadel.    6. From such specimens we can draw our inferences with regard to the  devices used in the buildings of antiquity, and conclude that they were  similar.    Furthermore, as men made progress by becoming daily more expert in  building, and as their ingenuity was increased by their dexterity so  that from habit they attained to considerable skill, their intelligence  was enlarged by their industry until the more proficient adopted the  trade of carpenters. From these early beginnings, and from the fact that  nature had not only endowed the human race with senses like the rest of  the animals, but had also equipped their minds with the powers of  thought and understanding, thus putting all other animals under their  sway, they next gradually advanced from the construction of buildings to  the other arts and sciences, and so passed from a rude and barbarous  mode of life to civilization and refinement.    7. Then, taking courage and looking forward from the standpoint of  higher ideas born of the multiplication of the arts, they gave up huts  and began to build houses with foundations, having brick or stone  walls, and roofs of timber and tiles; next, observation and application  led them from fluctuating and indefinite conceptions to definite rules  of symmetry. Perceiving that nature had been lavish in the bestowal of  timber and bountiful in stores of building material, they treated this  like careful nurses, and thus developing the refinements of life,  embellished them with luxuries. Therefore I shall now treat, to the best  of my ability, of the things which are suitable to be used in buildings,  showing their qualities and their excellencies.    8. Some persons, however, may find fault with the position of this book,  thinking that it should have been placed first. I will therefore explain  the matter, lest it be thought that I have made a mistake. Being engaged  in writing a complete treatise on architecture, I resolved to set forth  in the first book the branches of learning and studies of which it  consists, to define its departments, and to show of what it is composed.  Hence I have there declared what the qualities of an architect should  be. In the first book, therefore, I have spoken of the function of the  art, but in this I shall discuss the use of the building materials which  nature provides. For this book does not show of what architecture is  composed, but treats of the origin of the building art, how it was  fostered, and how it made progress, step by step, until it reached its  present perfection.    9. This book is, therefore, in its proper order and place.    I will now return to my subject, and with regard to the materials suited  to the construction of buildings will consider their natural formation  and in what proportions their elementary constituents were combined,  making it all clear and not obscure to my readers. For there is no kind  of material, no body, and no thing that can be produced or conceived of,  which is not made up of elementary particles; and nature does not admit  of a truthful exploration in accordance with the doctrines of the  physicists without an accurate demonstration of the primary causes of  things, showing how and why they are as they are.          CHAPTER II    ON THE PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE ACCORDING TO THE PHYSICISTS      1. First of all Thales thought that water was the primordial substance  of all things. Heraclitus of Ephesus, surnamed by the Greeks [Greek:  skoteinos] on account of the obscurity of his writings, thought that it  was fire. Democritus and his follower Epicurus thought that it was the  atoms, termed by our writers \"bodies that cannot be cut up,\" or, by  some, \"indivisibles.\" The school of the Pythagoreans added air and the  earthy to the water and fire. Hence, although Democritus did not in a  strict sense name them, but spoke only of indivisible bodies, yet he  seems to have meant these same elements, because when taken by  themselves they cannot be harmed, nor are they susceptible of  dissolution, nor can they be cut up into parts, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#9)"],[1,"s. From St. Paul's utterances he learns that Christ came to redeem  mankind by his voluntary oblation of himself. He was the Son of God!  Paul, not knowing that in the future a special form of conception would  be superimposed on Jesus, states that he was of human birth. The Martian  determined to ascertain what effect the teachings of St. Paul have had  on Christianity. He learns that, \"Ever since St. Paul, the ruling idea  of Christianity has been that of the redemption of man, guilty of a  prehistoric fault, by the voluntary sacrifice of a superman. This  doctrine is founded upon that of expiation; a guilty person must suffer  to atone for his fault; and that of the substitution of victims, the  efficacious suffering of an innocent person for a guilty one. Both are  at once pagan and Jewish ideas; they belong to the old fundamental  errors of humanity. Yet, Plato knew that the punishment inflicted on a  guilty person is not, nor should it be, a vengeance; it is a painful  remedy imposed on him for his own benefit and that of society. At about  the same period Athenian law laid down the principle that punishment  should be as personal as the fault, thus St. Paul founded Christian  Theology on two archaic ideas which had already been condemned by  enlightened Athenians of the fourth century before our era, _ideas which  no one would dream of upholding in these days, though the structure  built upon them still subsists_.\"    In chapter V of the first Epistle of St. John, these words strike the  visitor, \"There are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, and  the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are One.\" If these two  verses are authentic, they would be an affirmation of the doctrine of  the Trinity, dating from the first century, at a time when the Gospels,  the Acts, and St. Paul ignore it. It was first pointed out in 1806 that  these verses were an interpolation, for they do not appear in the best  manuscripts, notably all the Greek manuscripts down to the fifteenth  century. The Roman Church refused to bow to evidence. The Congregation  of the Index, on January 13, 1897, with the approbation of Leo XIII,  forbade any question as to the authenticity of the text relating to the  \"three heavenly witnesses.\" It appeared strange to the Martian that a  god should need the lies of his disciples to be incorporated in a divine  revelation. But his confusion was even greater when he read, \"We worship  one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the  Persons nor dividing the substance--and yet, they are not three  Eternals, but One Eternal, not three Almighties, but One Almighty. So,  the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and yet they are  not three Gods, but One God.... The Father is made of none, neither  created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor  created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son,  neither made nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.... And in this  Trinity, none is afore or after the other; none is greater or less than  another; but the whole three Persons are coeternal together and  coequal.\"    He thought this would make a great puzzle, truly an insoluble conundrum,  to take back to bewilder his Martian friends. However, he was able to  comprehend the remarks of Vigilantius, \"who returned from a journey in  Italy and the Holy Land disgusted with official Christianity. He  protested vehemently against the idolatrous worship of images, the  legacy of Paganism to the Church, a practice directly opposed to that  of the Mosaic law which Jesus came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. It  was idle to reply that these images were the Scriptures of the  illiterate, that they were not the object of, but the stimulus to,  worship. Experience showed that the majority of the faithful confounded  (as indeed they still do) the sign with the thing signified.\" (_Salomon  Reinach, \"Orpheus.\"_)    The result of the critical examination of the New Testament by the  Martian is that just as most of the Old Testament books are not only  anonymous but highly composite productions, that as certain writings  traditionally ascribed to Moses, David, Solomon, Daniel, and others are  utterly lacking in the necessary evidences in support of authorship, but  bear unmistakable evidence of having gone through a long compilatory  process; so does each gospel, despite its seeming unity, give evidence  of being a composite literary product. Scholars have agreed that Mark  first set forth the doings of Jesus and \"it was out of Mark that both  Matthew and Luke took the framework of their own writings, cleverly  fitting into its arrangement their own distinctive material and coloring  the whole by their own individual treatment.\" (_Trattner, \"Unravelling  the Book of Books.\"_) It is estimated that Mark was written shortly  before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70 A.D. \"This means that a  chasm of 30 or 40 years separates Mark's written document from the  ministry of Jesus--a long enough time to create a plastic body of oral  teachings and a highly colored tradition embellished with fanciful  stories.\"    Luke was a Greek physician living somewhere on the shores of the AEgean  Sea. He had been a friend of Paul, just as Mark had been with Peter.  Luke had no personal acquaintance with Jesus and had to get his  information from what others said, or from what the friends of  \"eye-witnesses\" had seen.    The Gospel of \"Matthew\" is an anonymous composition which, on analysis,  has been found to incorporate nearly fifty per cent of what is found in  Mark. It is now believed by many scholars to have been written between  the years 75 and 80 A.D. at Antioch not, of course, by the Apostle  Matthew, but by some unknown editor.    The Fourth Gospel, the Gospel of John, is vastly different in style,  arrangement, and in the description of the words, actions, and general  spiritual character of Jesus. Many scholars believe that it was written  in the city of Ephesus, somewhere around the year 100 A.D. \"Church  tradition ascribed it to the Apostle John, the son of Zebedee, one of  the fishermen whom Jesus called to be a disciple. Years ago this view  was easily entertained, but there now exists too much refractory  evidence against assigning this Greek Gospel to an Aramaic-speaking  Galilean. That an untutored fisherman could have written so elaborate  and so highly philosophical an account of Jesus has always presented a  thorny problem. And so to most scholars John's authorship of the Fourth  Gospel is unthinkable.\"    Not one of the Gospels is the work of an eyewitness, and the four  Gospels do not complete each other; they contradict each other; and when  they do not contradict, they repeat each other. The Christ of John is a  totally different person from the Christ of Mark, Matthew, and Luke.  Loisy, in his \"_Quelques Lettres_,\" states, \"If there is one thing above  others that is obvious, but as to which the most powerful of theological  interests have caused a deliberate or unconscious blindness, it is the  profound, the irreducible incompatibility of the Synoptical Gospels, and  the Fourth Gospel. If Jesus spoke and acted as he is said to have  spoken and acted in the first three Gospels, he did not speak and act as  he is reported to have done in the fourth.\"    The Martian is forced to the conclusion that the New Testament, with its  version of the Virgin Birth, Elizabeth, the cousin of Mary, Zacharias  and the Angel Gabriel, Jesus and the Sinner, are on par with the  eroticism of the Old Testament. The interpolations, the myth, and fable  also compare with the first revelation, and, in his opinion, he prefers  Andersen's Fairy Tales, or AEsop's Fables.    Meanwhile, a Protestant Brother mentions the name of Luther, and the  conclusions he draws are that the exciting cause of the Reformation was  an extravagant sale of indulgences conceded to the German Dominicans.  The Augustinians grew jealous of the Dominicans, and an Augustinian  Monk, Martin Luther, affixed to the door of Wittenberg Cathedral  ninety-five articles against the abuse of indulgences. This started the  fray in Germany with Luther at the head of this heresy. The gravest  difference of opinion had to do with the Communion. \"Luther retained  one-half of the mystery, and rejected the other half. He confesses that  the body of Jesus Christ is in the consecrated element, but it is, he  says, as fire is in the red-hot iron. The fire and the iron subsist  together. This is what they called impanation, invination,  consubstantiation. Thus, while those they called Papists ate God without  bread, the Lutherans ate God and bread; soon afterwards came the  Calvinists, who ate bread and did not eat God.\" In short, Luther was in  harmony with the Roman Church in nothing but the doctrines of the  Trinity, Baptism, the Incarnation, and the Resurrection. Luther thought  it was time to abolish private mass. He pretended the devil had appeared  to him and reproached him for saying mass and consecrating the  elements. The devil had proved to him, he said, that it was idolatry.  Luther declared that the devil was right and must be believed. The mass  was abolished in Wittenberg, and soon afterwards throughout Saxony; the  images were thrown down, monks and nuns left their cloisters, and, a few  years later, Luther married a nun called Catharine von Bora. This tale  did not greatly impress our guest.    A Catholic Brother, not to be outdone, extols the glories of his  Universal Church, and the Martian again sets out to investigate. This  time he finds:    The quotations in the New Testament which the Catholic creed interprets  as giving divine authority to its representatives on earth is a late  interpolation; the Trinity as stated above is a paradox which no  rational being can understand, and its dogmas and idolatry are  consistent with a civilization of 4000 years ago.
