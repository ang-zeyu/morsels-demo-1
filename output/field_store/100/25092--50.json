And no sooner had the clerk  given out the first verse of that great hymn, than it was taken up by  five hundred voices within the church, in bass and tenor, treble and  alto (for every one could sing in those days, and the west-country folk,  as now, were fuller than any of music), the chant was caught up by the  crowd outside, and rang away over roof and river, up to the woods of  Annery, and down to the marshes of the Taw, in wave on wave of harmony.  And as it died away, the shipping in the river made answer with their  thunder, and the crowd streamed out again toward the Bridge Head,  whither Sir Richard Grenville, and Sir John Chichester, and Mr.  Salterne, the Mayor, led the five heroes of the day to await the pageant  which had been prepared in honor of them. And as they went by, there  were few in the crowd who did not press forward to shake them by the  hand, and not only them, but their parents and kinsfolk who walked  behind, till Mrs. Leigh, her stately joy quite broken down at last,  could only answer between her sobs, \"Go along, good people--God a mercy,  go along--and God send you all such sons!\"    \"God give me back mine!\" cried an old red-cloaked dame in the crowd; and  then, struck by some hidden impulse, she sprang forward, and catching  hold of young Amyas's sleeve--    \"Kind sir! dear sir! For Christ his sake answer a poor old widow woman!\"    \"What is it, dame?\" quoth Amyas, gently enough.    \"Did you see my son to the Indies?--my son Salvation?\"    \"Salvation?\" replied he, with the air of one who recollected the name.    \"Yes, sure, Salvation Yeo, of Clovelly. A tall man and black, and  sweareth awfully in his talk, the Lord forgive him!\"    Amyas recollected now. It was the name of the sailor who had given him  the wondrous horn five years ago.    \"My good dame,\" said he, \"the Indies are a very large place, and your  son may be safe and sound enough there, without my having seen him.  I knew one Salvation Yeo. But he must have come with--By the by,  godfather, has Mr. Oxenham come home?\"    There was a dead silence for a moment among the gentlemen round; and  then Sir Richard said solemnly, and in a low voice, turning away from  the old dame,--    \"Amyas, Mr. Oxenham has not come home; and from the day he sailed, no  word has been heard of him and all his crew.\"    \"Oh, Sir Richard! and you kept me from sailing with him! Had I known  this before I went into church, I had had one mercy more to thank God  for.\"    \"Thank Him all the more in thy life, my child!\" whispered his mother.    \"And no news of him whatsoever?\"    \"None; but that the year after he sailed, a ship belonging to Andrew  Barker, of Bristol, took out of a Spanish caravel, somewhere off the  Honduras, his two brass guns; but whence they came the Spaniard knew  not, having bought them at Nombre de Dios.\"    \"Yes!\" cried the old woman; \"they brought home the guns, and never  brought home my boy!\"    \"They never saw your boy, mother,\" said Sir Richard.    \"But I've seen him! I saw him in a dream four years last Whitsuntide, as  plain as I see you now, gentles, a-lying upon a rock, calling for a drop  of water to cool his tongue, like Dives to the torment! Oh! dear me!\"  and the old dame wept bitterly.    \"There is a rose noble for you!\" said Mrs. Leigh.    \"And there another!\" said Sir Richard. And in a few minutes four or five  gold coins were in her hand. But the old dame did but look wonderingly  at the gold a moment, and then--    \"Ah! dear gentles, God's blessing on you, and Mr. Cary's mighty good to  me already; but gold won't buy back childer! O! young gentleman! young  gentleman! make me a promise; if you want God's blessing on you this  day, bring me back my boy, if you find him sailing on the seas! Bring  him back, and an old widow's blessing be on you!\"    Amyas promised--what else could he do?--and the group hurried on; but  the lad's heart was heavy in the midst of joy, with the thought of John  Oxenham, as he walked through the churchyard, and down the short street  which led between the ancient school and still more ancient town-house,  to the head of the long bridge, across which the pageant, having  arranged \"east-the-water,\" was to defile, and then turn to the right  along the quay.    However, he was bound in all courtesy to turn his attention now to the  show which had been prepared in his honor, and which was really well  enough worth seeing and hearing. The English were, in those days, an  altogether dramatic people; ready and able, as in Bideford that day, to  extemporize a pageant, a masque, or any effort of the Thespian art short  of the regular drama. For they were, in the first place, even down to  the very poorest, a well-fed people, with fewer luxuries than we, but  more abundant necessaries; and while beef, ale, and good woollen clothes  could be obtained in plenty, without overworking either body or soul,  men had time to amuse themselves in something more intellectual  than mere toping in pot-houses. Moreover, the half century after the  Reformation in England was one not merely of new intellectual freedom,  but of immense animal good spirits. After years of dumb confusion and  cruel persecution, a breathing time had come: Mary and the fires of  Smithfield had vanished together like a hideous dream, and the mighty  shout of joy which greeted Elizabeth's entry into London, was the  key-note of fifty glorious years; the expression of a new-found strength  and freedom, which vented itself at home in drama and in song; abroad  in mighty conquests, achieved with the laughing recklessness of boys at  play.    So first, preceded by the waits, came along the bridge toward the  town-hall a device prepared by the good rector, who, standing by, acted  as showman, and explained anxiously to the bystanders the import of  a certain \"allegory\" wherein on a great banner was depicted Queen  Elizabeth herself, who, in ample ruff and farthingale, a Bible in one  hand and a sword in the other, stood triumphant upon the necks of two  sufficiently abject personages, whose triple tiara and imperial crown  proclaimed them the Pope and the King of Spain; while a label, issuing  from her royal mouth, informed the world that--         \"By land and sea a virgin queen I reign,       And spurn to dust both Antichrist and Spain.\"    Which, having been received with due applause, a well-bedizened lad,  having in his cap as a posy \"Loyalty,\" stepped forward, and delivered  himself of the following verses:--         \"Oh, great Eliza! oh, world-famous crew!       Which shall I hail more blest, your queen or you?       While without other either falls to wrack,       And light must eyes, or eyes their light must lack.       She without you, a diamond sunk in mine,       Its worth unprized, to self alone must shine;       You without her, like hands bereft of head,       Like Ajax rage, by blindfold lust misled.       She light, you eyes; she head, and you the hands,       In fair proportion knit by heavenly hands;       Servants in queen, and queen in servants blest;       Your only glory, how to serve her best;       And hers how best the adventurous might to guide,       Which knows no check of foemen, wind, or tide,       So fair Eliza's spotless fame may fly       Triumphant round the globe, and shake th' astounded sky!\"    With which sufficiently bad verses Loyalty passed on, while my Lady Bath  hinted to Sir Richard, not without reason, that the poet, in trying to  exalt both parties, had very sufficiently snubbed both, and intimated  that it was \"hardly safe for country wits to attempt that euphuistic,  antithetical, and delicately conceited vein, whose proper fountain was  in Whitehall.\" However, on went Loyalty, very well pleased with himself,  and next, amid much cheering, two great tinsel fish, a salmon and a  trout, symbolical of the wealth of Torridge, waddled along, by means  of two human legs and a staff apiece, which protruded from the fishes'  stomachs. They drew (or seemed to draw, for half the 'prentices in the  town were shoving it behind, and cheering on the panting monarchs of  the flood) a car wherein sate, amid reeds and river-flags, three or  four pretty girls in robes of gray-blue spangled with gold, their heads  wreathed one with a crown of the sweet bog-myrtle, another with hops  and white convolvulus, the third with pale heather and golden fern. They  stopped opposite Amyas; and she of the myrtle wreath, rising and bowing  to him and the company, began with a pretty blush to say her say:--         \"Hither from my moorland home,       Nymph of Torridge, proud I come;       Leaving fen and furzy brake,       Haunt of eft and spotted snake,       Where to fill mine urns I use,       Daily with Atlantic dews;       While beside the reedy flood       Wild duck leads her paddling brood.       For this morn, as Phoebus gay       Chased through heaven the night mist gray,       Close beside me, prankt in pride,       Sister Tamar rose, and cried,       'Sluggard, up! 'Tis holiday,       In the lowlands far away.       Hark! how jocund Plymouth bells,       Wandering up through mazy dells,       Call me down, with smiles to hail,       My daring Drake's returning sail.'       'Thine alone?' I answer'd.  'Nay;       Mine as well the joy to-day.       Heroes train'd on Northern wave,       To that Argo new I gave;       Lent to thee, they roam'd the main;       Give me, nymph, my sons again.'       'Go, they wait Thee,' Tamar cried,       Southward bounding from my side.       Glad I rose, and at my call,       Came my Naiads, one and all.       Nursling of the mountain sky,       Leaving Dian's choir on high,       Down her cataracts laughing loud,       Ockment leapt from crag and cloud,       Leading many a nymph, who dwells"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#9)"],[1,"were looking for her. His reflections took a  new form.    What of Gaston Max, foremost criminologist in Europe, who now lay dead  and mutilated in an East-End mortuary? The telephone message which had  summoned Dunbar away had been too opportune to be regarded as a mere  coincidence. Mlle. Dorian was, therefore, an accomplice of a murderer.    Stuart sighed. He would have given much--more than he was prepared to  admit to himself--to have known her to be guiltless.    The identity of the missing cabman now engaged his mind. It was quite  possible, of course, that the man had actually found the envelope in  his cab a was in no other way concerned in the matter. But how had  Mlle. Dorian, or the person instructing her, traced the envelope to  his study? And why, if they could establish a claim to it, had they  preferred to attempt to steal it? Finally, why all this disturbance  about a blank piece of cardboard?    A mental picture of the envelope arose before him, the number, 30,  written upon it and the two black seals securing the lapels. He paused  again in his walk. His reflections had led him to a second definite  point and he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket for a time, seeking a  certain brass coin about the size of a halfpenny, having a square hole  in the middle and peculiar characters engraved around the square, one  on each of the four sides.    He failed to find the coin in his pocket, however, but he walked  briskly up a side street until he came to the entrance to a tube  station. Entering a public telephone call-box, he asked for the  number, City 400. Being put through and having deposited the necessary  fee in the box:    \"Is that the Commissioner's Office, New Scotland Yard?\" he asked.  \"Yes! My name is Dr. Keppel Stuart. If Inspector Dunbar is there,  would you kindly allow me to speak to him.\"    There was a short interval, then:    \"Hullo!\" came--\"is that Dr. Stuart?\"    \"Yes. That you, Inspector? I have just remembered something which I  should have observed in the first place if I had been really wide-awake.  The envelope--you know the one I mean?--the one bearing the number, 30,  has been sealed with a Chinese coin, known as _cash_. I have just  recognized the fact and thought it wise to let you know at once.\"    \"Are you sure?\" asked Dunbar.    \"Certain. If you care to call at my place later to-day I can show you  some _cash_. Bring the envelope with you and you will see that the  coins correspond to the impression in the wax. The inscriptions vary  in different provinces, but the form of all _cash_ is the same.\"    \"Very good. Thanks for letting me know at once. It seems to establish  a link with China, don't you think?\"    \"It does, but it merely adds to the mystery.\"    Coming out of the call-box, Stuart proceeded home, but made one or  two professional visits before he actually returned to the house. He  now remembered having left his particular _cash_ piece (which he  usually carried) in his dispensary, which satisfactorily accounted  for his failure to find the coin in his waistcoat pocket. He had  broken the cork of a flask, and in the absence of another of correct  size had manufactured a temporary stopper with a small cork to the top  of which he had fixed the Chinese coin with a drawing-pin. His purpose  served he had left the extemporised stopper lying somewhere in the  dispensary.    Stuart's dispensary was merely a curtained recess at one end of the  waiting-room and shortly after entering the house he had occasion to  visit it. Lying upon a shelf among flasks and bottles was the Chinese  coin with the cork still attached. He took it up in order to study the  inscription. Then:    \"Have I cultivated somnambulism!\" he muttered.    Fragments of black sealing-wax adhered to the coin!    Incredulous and half fearful he peered at it closely. He remembered  that the impression upon the wax sealing the mysterious envelope had  had a circular depression in the centre. It had been made by the head  of the drawing-pin!    He found himself staring at the shelf immediately above that upon  which the coin had lain. A stick of black sealing-wax used for sealing  medicine was thrust in beside a bundle of long envelopes in which he  was accustomed to post his Infirmary reports!    One hand raised to his head, Stuart stood endeavouring to marshal his  ideas into some sane order. Then, knowing what he should find, he  raised the green baize curtain hanging from the lower shelf, which  concealed a sort of cupboard containing miscellaneous stores and not  a little rubbish, including a number of empty cardboard boxes.    A rectangular strip had been roughly cut from the lid of the topmost  box!    The mysterious envelope and its contents, the wax and the seal--all  had come from his own dispensary!          CHAPTER IX    THE CHINESE COIN      Deep in reflection, Stuart walked alone along the Embankment. The full  facts contained in the report form Paris the Commissioner had not  divulged, but Stuart concluded that this sudden activity was directly  due, not to the death of M. Max, but to the fact that he (Max) had  left behind him some more or less tangible clue. Stuart fully  recognized that the Commissioner had accorded him an opportunity to  establish his reputation--or to wreck it.    Yet, upon closer consideration, it became apparent that it was to Fate  and not to the Commissioner that he was indebted. Strictly speaking,  his association with the matter dated from the night of his meeting  with the mysterious cabman in West India Dock Road. Or had the  curtain first been lifted upon this occult drama that evening, five  years ago, as the setting sun reddened the waters of the Imperial  Canal and a veiled figure passed him on the Wu-Men Bridge?    \"Shut your eyes tightly, master--the Scorpion is coming!\"    He seemed to hear the boy's words now, as he passed along the  Embankment; he seemed to see again the tall figure. And suddenly he  stopped, stood still and stared with unseeing eyes across the muddy  waters of the Thames. He was thinking of the cowled man who had stood  behind the curtains in his study--of that figure so wildly bizarre  that even now he could scarcely believe that he had ever actually seen  it. He walked on.    Automatically his reflections led him to Mlle. Dorian, and he  remembered that even as he paced along there beside the river the  wonderful mechanism of New Scotland Yard was in motion, its many  tentacles seeking--seeking tirelessly--for the girl, whose dark eyes  haunted his sleeping and waking hours. _He_ was responsible, and if  she were arrested _he_ would be called upon to identify her. He  condemned himself bitterly.    After all, what crime had she committed? She had tried to purloin a  letter--which did not belong to Stuart in the first place. And she had  failed. Now--the police were looking for her. His reflections took a  new form.    What of Gaston Max, foremost criminologist in Europe, who now lay dead  and mutilated in an East-End mortuary? The telephone message which had  summoned Dunbar away had been too opportune to be regarded as a mere  coincidence. Mlle. Dorian was, therefore, an accomplice of a murderer.    Stuart sighed.
