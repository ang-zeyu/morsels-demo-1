More than a hundred little reddish-black  calves leisurely loped in the rear. Kentuck, keen to his work, crept on  like a wolf, and the hunter's great fist clenched the coiled lasso.  Before him expanded a boundless plain. A situation long cherished and  dreamed of had become a reality. Kentuck, fresh and strong, was good  for all day. Jones gloated over the little red bulls and heifers, as a  miser gloats over gold and jewels. Never before had he caught more than  two in one day, and often it had taken days to capture one. This was  the last herd, this the last opportunity toward perpetuating a grand  race of beasts. And with born instinct he saw ahead the day of his life.    At a touch, Kentuck closed in, and the buffalo, seeing him, stampeded  into the heaving roll so well known to the hunter. Racing on the right  flank of the herd, Jones selected a tawny heifer and shot the lariat  after her. It fell true, but being stiff and kinky from the sleet,  failed to tighten, and the quick calf leaped through the loop to  freedom.    Undismayed the pursuer quickly recovered his rope. Again he whirled and  sent the loop. Again it circled true, and failed to close; again the  agile heifer bounded through it. Jones whipped the air with the  stubborn rope. To lose a chance like that was worse than boy's work.    The third whirl, running a smaller loop, tightened the coil round the  frightened calf just back of its ears. A pull on the bridle brought  Kentuck to a halt in his tracks, and the baby buffalo rolled over and  over in the grass. Jones bounced from his seat and jerked loose a  couple of the soft cords. In a twinkling; his big knee crushed down on  the calf, and his big hands bound it helpless.    Kentuck neighed. Jones saw his black ears go up. Danger threatened. For  a moment the hunter's blood turned chill, not from fear, for he never  felt fear, but because he thought the Indians were returning to ruin  his work. His eye swept the plain. Only the gray forms of wolves  flitted through the grass, here, there, all about him. Wolves! They  were as fatal to his enterprise as savages. A trooping pack of prairie  wolves had fallen in with the herd and hung close on the trail, trying  to cut a calf away from its mother. The gray brutes boldly trotted to  within a few yards of him, and slyly looked at him, with pale, fiery  eyes. They had already scented his captive. Precious time flew by; the  situation, critical and baffling, had never before been met by him.  There lay his little calf tied fast, and to the north ran many others,  some of which he must--he would have. To think quickly had meant the  solving of many a plainsman's problem. Should he stay with his prize to  save it, or leave it to be devoured?    \"Ha! you old gray devils!\" he yelled, shaking his fist at the wolves.  \"I know a trick or two.\" Slipping his hat between the legs of the calf,  he fastened it securely. This done, he vaulted on Kentuck, and was off  with never a backward glance. Certain it was that the wolves would not  touch anything, alive or dead, that bore the scent of a human being.    The bison scoured away a long half-mile in the lead, sailing northward  like a cloud-shadow over the plain. Kentuck, mettlesome, over-eager,  would have run himself out in short order, but the wary hunter, strong  to restrain as well as impel, with the long day in his mind, kept the  steed in his easy stride, which, springy and stretching, overhauled the  herd in the course of several miles.    A dash, a swirl, a shock, a leap, horse and hunter working in perfect  accord, and a fine big calf, bellowing lustily, struggled desperately  for freedom under the remorseless knee. The big hands toyed with him;  and then, secure in the double knots, the calf lay still, sticking out  his tongue and rolling his eyes, with the coat of the hunter tucked  under his bonds to keep away the wolves.    The race had but begun; the horse had but warmed to his work; the  hunter had but tasted of sweet triumph. Another hopeful of a buffalo  mother, negligent in danger, truant from his brothers, stumbled and  fell in the enmeshing loop. The hunter's vest, slipped over the calf's  neck, served as danger signal to the wolves. Before the lumbering  buffalo missed their loss, another red and black baby kicked helplessly  on the grass and sent up vain, weak calls, and at last lay still, with  the hunter's boot tied to his cords.    Four! Jones counted them aloud, add in his mind, and kept on. Fast,  hard work, covering upward of fifteen miles, had begun to tell on herd,  horse and man, and all slowed down to the call for strength. The fifth  time Jones closed in on his game, he encountered different  circumstances such as called forth his cunning.    The herd had opened up; the mothers had fallen back to the rear; the  calves hung almost out of sight under the shaggy sides of protectors.  To try them out Jones darted close and threw his lasso. It struck a  cow. With activity incredible in such a huge beast, she lunged at him.  Kentuck, expecting just such a move, wheeled to safety. This duel,  ineffectual on both sides, kept up for a while, and all the time, man  and herd were jogging rapidly to the north.    Jones could not let well enough alone; he acknowledged this even as he  swore he must have five. Emboldened by his marvelous luck, and yielding  headlong to the passion within, he threw caution to the winds. A lame  old cow with a red calf caught his eye; in he spurred his willing horse  and slung his rope. It stung the haunch of the mother. The mad grunt  she vented was no quicker than the velocity with which she plunged and  reared. Jones had but time to swing his leg over the saddle when the  hoofs beat down. Kentuck rolled on the plain, flinging his rider from  him. The infuriated buffalo lowered her head for the fatal charge on  the horse, when the plainsman, jerking out his heavy Colts, shot her  dead in her tracks.    Kentuck got to his feet unhurt, and stood his ground, quivering but  ready, showing his steadfast courage. He showed more, for his ears lay  back, and his eyes had the gleam of the animal that strikes back.    The calf ran round its mother. Jones lassoed it, and tied it down,  being compelled to cut a piece from his lasso, as the cords on the  saddle had given out. He left his other boot with baby number five. The  still heaving, smoking body of the victim called forth the stern,  intrepid hunter's pity for a moment. Spill of blood he had not wanted.  But he had not been able to avoid it; and mounting again with  close-shut jaw and smoldering eye, he galloped to the north.    Kentuck snorted; the pursuing wolves shied off in the grass; the pale  sun began to slant westward. The cold iron stirrups froze and cut the  hunter's bootless feet.    When once more he came hounding the buffalo, they were considerably  winded. Short-tufted tails, raised stiffly, gave warning. Snorts, like  puffs of escaping steam, and deep grunts from cavernous chests evinced  anger and impatience that might, at any moment, bring the herd to a  defiant stand.    He whizzed the shortened noose over the head of a calf that was  laboring painfully to keep up, and had slipped down, when a mighty  grunt told him of peril. Never looking to see whence it came, he sprang  into the saddle. Fiery Kentuck jumped into action, then hauled up with  a shock that almost threw himself and rider. The lasso, fast to the  horse, and its loop end round the calf, had caused the sudden check.    A maddened cow bore down on Kentuck. The gallant horse straightened in  a jump, but dragging the calf pulled him in a circle, and in another  moment he was running round and round the howling, kicking pivot. Then  ensued a terrible race, with horse and bison describing a twenty-foot  circle. Bang! Bang! The hunter fired two shots, and heard the spats of  the bullets. But they only augmented the frenzy of the beast. Faster  Kentuck flew, snorting in terror; closer drew the dusty, bouncing  pursuer; the calf spun like a top; the lasso strung tighter than wire.  Jones strained to loosen the fastening, but in vain. He swore at his  carelessness in dropping his knife by the last calf he had tied. He  thought of shooting the rope, yet dared not risk the shot. A hollow  sound turned him again, with the Colts leveled. Bang! Dust flew from  the ground beyond the bison.    The two charges left in the gun were all that stood between him and  eternity. With a desperate display of strength Jones threw his weight  in a backward pull, and hauled Kentuck up. Then he leaned far back in  the saddle, and shoved the Colts out beyond the horse's flank. Down  went the broad head, with its black, glistening horns. Bang! She slid  forward with a crash, plowing the ground with hoofs and nose--spouted  blood, uttered a hoarse cry, kicked and died.    Kentuck, for once completely terrorized, reared and plunged from the  cow, dragging the calf. Stern command and iron arm forced him to a  standstill. The calf, nearly strangled, recovered when the noose was  slipped, and moaned a feeble protest against life and captivity. The  remainder of Jones's lasso went to bind number six, and one of his  socks went to serve as reminder to the persistent wolves.    \"Six! On! On! Kentuck! On!\" Weakening, but unconscious of it, with  bloody hands and feet, without lasso, and with only one charge in his  revolver, hatless, coatless, vestless, bootless, the wild hunter urged  on the noble horse. The herd had gained miles in the interval of the  fight. Game to the backbone, Kentuck lengthened out to overhaul it, and  slowly the rolling gap lessened and lessened. A long hour thumped away,  with the rumble growing nearer.    Once again the lagging calves dotted the grassy plain before the  hunter. He dashed beside a burly calf, grasped its tail, stopped his  horse, and jumped. The calf went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#9)"],[1,"0. Whether  Count Morzin would have made an exception in Haydn's case, and retained  him in spite of this event, there is no means of telling, for that  nobleman met with financial reverses, and was forced to give up his  musical establishment. Fortunately for the young genius, some of his  works had been heard and admired by the Prince Paul Esterhazy, who  showed his musical discernment by taking Haydn into his service and  becoming a lifelong patron of the composer.    There was little real affection between Haydn and his wife at the start  of their life journey together. He declared, however, that he really  began to have some feeling for her, and would have come to entertain  still warmer sentiments toward her if she had behaved at all reasonably.  But unfortunately, she did not seem to be capable of behaving  reasonably. The wives of great men are usually proud of the attainments  of their husbands, and take no pains to conceal this fact. But the  barber's daughter of Vienna was totally lacking in any real appreciation  of her gifted consort. As Haydn himself observed once, it would have  made no difference if he had been a shoemaker instead of an artist. She  used his manuscript scores as curl-papers and underlays for the family  pastry; she made continual use of the conjugal privilege of going  through his pockets and abstracting the cash; and once, when he was in  London, her calm selfishness rose to the point of asking him to buy a  certain house, which she admired, so that she might have a home provided  for her widowhood.    Through all his troubles, Haydn preserved a dignified silence about his  domestic unhappiness, and in his letters it is mentioned only twice. For  a long time he bore the trials patiently, but at length was forced to  give up the household and live apart from his domestic tormentor. The  woman who had hoped for a permanent home in her widowhood ended her  lonely existence in 1800, nine years before the close of her husband's  career.    With these facts in view, it is not surprising to find that Haydn at  times sought elsewhere the consolation he was denied at home. He was  fond of feminine companions, especially when they were well endowed with  personal attractions. He must have possessed ingratiating manners, for  he certainly could not boast of great personal attractions, and he  himself admitted that his fair admirers were, \"At any rate, not tempted  by his beauty.\" His natural tenderness showed itself in a passionate  fondness for children,--a blessing denied to his own home.    One of his most violent friendships had for its object a young Italian  singer of nineteen, Luigia Polzelli. Apparently she was not happy with  her husband, and a bond of mutual sympathy drew the composer to her.  After the death of her husband, she persuaded Haydn to sign a promise to  marry her if his wife should die, but the composer afterward repudiated  the agreement, very likely not wishing to repeat his first matrimonial  blunder.    Another romance is found in the love-letters sent to the composer by a  charming London widow named Schroeter. Without overstepping the bounds  of propriety, he was able to draw some profit from this episode, for he  gave lessons to his fair admirer, and allowed her to do manuscript  copying for him. Apparently the friendship was more of her seeking than  of his own, as her letters to him bear witness. These are copied neatly  in one of his note-books, along with various amusing \"Anectods,\" a  description of a London fog, \"thick enough to be spread on bread,\" and  an excellent receipt for making the Prince of Wales's punch.    Mozart was another musical genius who was forced to accept as second  choice the sister of his first love, though in his case the results  were not so disastrous as with Haydn. It was in Mannheim, on the way to  Paris, that Mozart made the acquaintance of the copyist Weber, and  succumbed to the charms of his daughter, Aloysia. But Leopold Mozart,  wisely playing the role of stern father, soon sped the susceptible youth  on his way to the French capital. It is a French proverb that tells  us,--      \"Nous revenons toujours     A nos premiers amours,\"--    and a year later he returned. But Aloysia, now famous by her singing,  soon made it plain that his affection was no longer returned. Mozart  seems to have borne the blow well, and soon after her marriage to the  actor Lange, who proved a jealous husband, he wrote home his decision to  wed her younger sister, Constance. After much opposition from members of  both families, he carried out his intention.    As in Haydn's case, the young couple were forced to live on \"bread and  cheese and kisses,\" with none too much of the first two articles.  Mozart, more than any other composer, met with undeserved hardships. On  every side his music was praised and his genius admired, but nobles and  princes, and even the emperor, would give him no material aid. He made a  devoted husband, and much of the money that disappeared so readily from  his hands was probably used for the benefit of his wife, whose health  was not of the best. Their life (in Vienna at first) was a continual  effort to solve the old vexed problem of making both ends meet, and  Constance must be given high praise for the wonderful skill with which  she managed the small and uncertain income of her husband. Several times  the young couple were brought face to face with the direst need, but  their patience and cheerfulness carried them through the crisis. On one  occasion, when there was no fuel on hand and no money to buy any, a  visitor found the pair busily engaged in waltzing about their bare room  in order to keep warm. At another time they were rescued from their  extremity only by the kindness of their friend, the Baroness  Waldstaetten, who intervened just in time to save them from beggary.  After three years, Leopold Mozart relented enough to visit his  daughter-in-law, whom he found far more deserving than he had expected;  but he himself was not well off, and could be of little financial help.    That Constance was of great aid to her husband, in spite of an  easy-going nature, cannot be doubted. She possessed the faculty of  telling interesting stories and novelettes, and with this apparently  inexhaustible fund of invention she would amuse him between his periods  of work. The description that we have of the composition of the great  \"Don Giovanni\" overture gives a pleasing illustration of this phase of  the family life. Owing to rehearsals and other work, the day before the  performance arrived with no overture yet written. In the evening,  according to his custom, Mozart began the task by sketching out the  themes and a general plan of construction for the work. Near him sat his  wife, ready to entertain him with her pleasing tales when he looked up  from his work. For one or two hours he did indulge in actual repose; but  all through the rest of the night he continued the work, relieving his  mental concentration by listening to the storiettes or occasionally  sipping a glass of his favourite punch. The manuscript was completed and  ready for the copyist the next morning at seven o'clock, and along with  the other numbers scored a complete success in the evening.    Some blame has attached to Constance for the lack of exact knowledge  about Mozart's grave. At the hour of his burial, in the public cemetery,  a violent storm drove away all the mourners. There was a cholera scare  in Vienna at the time, which kept many people away from the graveyard.  Her own neglect of the matter may have been caused by illness, but,  whatever the reason, the fact remains that when public interest was  aroused the exact location of Mozart's grave could no longer be defined.    The life of Carl Maria von Weber was tinged in its earlier years with  the romance that seemed to pervade all phases of life in his native  country. Germany had just passed through one of her rare but regular  periods of national awakening, and every one was full of a keen spirit  of patriotic originality in life, letters, and art, as well as in music.  Gifted with unusual talents, trained in the paternal hope of his  becoming a boy prodigy like Mozart, and urged by the need of making his  own career, he soon made a name for himself by his personal charms as  well as his talents. A welcome guest in the homes of aristocracy and  cultivation, he possessed a roving disposition and a spirit of adventure  that made his life not unlike that of the early Troubadours.    It was in Vienna that he met his future wife. Being given charge of the  opera at Prague, he journeyed to the Austrian capital for the purpose of  engaging singers, and among them brought back the talented Caroline  Brandt. He soon wished to enter into closer relations with this singer,  but found obstacles in the way of marriage. She was unwilling to  sacrifice at once a career that was winning her many laurels, and she  did not wholly approve of the wandering life that the gifted young  manager had led up to the time of their meeting. We find him  discontented with this situation, and travelling about in search of a  better and more important post; and during one of these trips he  received a letter from Caroline, saying that they had better part. This  brought forth the accusation from the embittered Weber that \"Her views  of high art were not above the usual pitiful standard, namely, that it  was but a means of procuring soup, meat, and shirts.\" There can be no  doubt, however, that her influence was of the utmost value in steadying  his efforts.    When Weber was once back in Prague, her real love for him overcame all  scruples, and she showed herself ready to wait until he should attain a  post of sufficient value to permit their marriage. After putting the  Prague opera on a stable basis, he looked about for a long time in vain,  until finally he obtained a life position as conductor in Dresden."]]]
