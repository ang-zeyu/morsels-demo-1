TOMASSO. What is the secret?    ANITA. If I told-a you, Tomasso, then it would no longer be a secret.    TOMASSO. You should-a not have the secrets from me, Anita. I am your  cousin, also--I am the head of the family.    ANITA. But I made the promise not to tell.    TOMASSO. Who you make-a the promise to?    ANITA. I promised Jack--(_hesitates_) I mean, I make-a de promise to  someone.    TOMASSO. To Jack! Who is this-a Jack, Anita?    ANITA. That is part of the secret. Listen, Tomasso, tomorrow morning  you shall know everything. Early in the morning shall I tell-a you my  secret. That will be my Christmas present to you.    TOMASSO. All right. I'll wait. Oh, see, Anita, the moon is coming up.  (_Points to L._) Just like-a big, round-a silver ball.    ANITA. Let us stay here and watch the moon, Tomasso.    TOMASSO. You'd better go and get your supper. Those leetla Dutch twins  are eating everything on the table. I think they'd eat the table  itself if it was-a not nailed to the deck. Hurry, Anita!    ANITA. I go. (_Crosses to door at R., then turns toward him_). It's a  awful good-a secret, Tomasso. (_Laughs and runs out at R._)    TOMASSO (_looks off L._). Ah, the great, grand-a lady moon. She looks  at me, I look at her. Maybe she'll like a leetla serenade.    (_Simple violin solo by_ TOMASSO, _accompanied by hidden organ or  piano. After he has been playing sometime, the other children come  softly in from the R. and group around the stage. Note: If possible,  get a boy for_ TOMASSO'S _part who can play the violin; if not,  introduce a song at this point. \"Santa Lucia,\" found in most school  collections, would prove effective either as a vocal solo or as a  violin solo._)    BIDDY MARY. Sure, that's beautiful. It takes me back again to dear  ould Ireland where the River Shannon flows.    HULDA. What do you do in Ireland the night before Christmas, Biddy  Mary?    MEENY. Do you have a Christmas tree like we do in Germany?    BIDDY MARY. We do not. We don't have any tree at all, at all.    PADDY MIKE. And we don't get many presents. But it's a fine time we  have for all that. Instead of getting presents, we have the fun of  giving presents--and that's the finest thing in all the world, so it  is, to make the other fellow happy. Sure, I just love to give  presents.    KLINKER. You can give me some if you want to.    SCHWILLIE. Und me also some.    BIDDY MARY. But where would we be getting presents out here in the  middle of the ocean? In dear ould Ireland sure it's a fine time we're  after having on Christmas Day.    PADDY MIKE. It is that. With the fiddles playing and the dancers  dancing and the fine suppers upon the table.    SERGIUS. In Russia we always set a table in front of the window and  put a fine linen cloth on it. (_Produces white lace-edged cloth._)  Here is the cloth, but we have no window.    HULDA. Here, use this box as a table. (_Indicates a large box at rear  C._) Now, let us put the cloth on, so! (HULDA _and_ SERGIUS _put cloth  on the box._)    BIDDY MARY. The night before Christmas we always put a big candle, all  gay with ribbons, in the window to welcome the Christ child.    PADDY MIKE. Here is the candle. (_Places it on box at rear C._) Now  I'll light it. (_Lights candle._)    TOMASSO. We do that also in Italy. And we put a leetla picture of the  Christ child on the table. (_Puts colored picture of Madonna and Child  back of the candle._)    BIDDY MARY. On Christmas Day it's the fine old tales we're after  hearing in Ireland, all about the wonderful star that shone so bright  that it turned night into day, and led the Wise Men all the way to  where a little Babe in the manger lay.    PADDY MIKE. And all the angels sang above of peace on earth, good will  and love.    BIDDY MARY.         The shepherds wandering on the hill,       Beheld the star and followed till       They saw the Child and heard the song,       The angels sang the whole night long.    SERGIUS. May the spirit of Christmas enter every heart tonight, making  all the world one big, happy family, no rich, no poor, no high, no  low, all brothers and sisters, all children of the Lord on high!    MEENY. Maybe good old Santa Claus will come after all. Vell, if he  does I want to be ready for him. (_Produces two very large red  stockings, made for the occasion._) Come, Yakob and Hans and Mieze,  let us hang up our stockings here under the burning candle. (_They  hang up the four pair of stockings._)    NEELDA (_places a wreath of holly on the table_). Christ was born on  the Christmas Day, wreathe the holly, twine the bay! Light and Life  and Joy is He, the Babe, the Son, the Holy One of Mary!    TOMASSO. Meeny and Yakob and Hans and leetla Mieze have hung up their  stockings for the good-a Saint Nicholas, but in Italy we set out our  shoes, so! And we always get them full of presents. (_Places small  pair of wooden shoes on table._)    MEENY. I like stockings much better than shoes already, because the  stockings can stretch yet, und if they stretch real, real wide out  maybe we can get a baby piano or a automobile in our stockings. Jah,  stockings is mooch better als shoes.    HULDA. Here is my beautiful star. (_Produces tinsel star._) That will  remind us of the Star of Bethlehem that led the three Wise Men across  the hills and plains of Judea unto the little manger where,  surrounded by cattle and oxen, amid the straw, the Lord of Heaven was  born on Christmas Eve.    SCHWILLIE. Und all the angels sang, \"Peace on earth, good will to  men,\" didn't they, Klinker?    KLINKER. Und all the shepherds heard them, and they followed the star  and came to the manger to see the little Baby.    MEENY. Let us all sit down here in front of the candle and the star,  and see if old Santa Claus has forgotten us already. It's almost time  for him to be coming. (_All sit down._)    ALL (_sing_).         THE TIME IS NEAR.    [Music illustration:         1. The time is near, the time is near,       San-ta Claus will soon be here!       All the world is sweet-ly sleep-ing,       An-gels now their watch are keep-ing,       And the moon shines clear,       And the moon shines clear.         2. Be-fore the dawn, be-fore the dawn,       Saint Nick will have come and gone!       Now with pa-tience we'll a-wait him,       Hop-ing noth-ing may be-late him,       On his jour-ney long,       On his jour-ney long.]    HULDA. Oh, I do hope Santa Claus will come and visit us tonight. But  of course he cannot go every place. Some children have to be left out.    KLINKER. Yes, that's so; but I hope it ain't us. Don't you, Schwillie  Willie Winkum?    SCHWILLIE. Sure, I do. I wish old Santa would hurry up and come,  'cause the old Sandman is here already. I'm getting awful sleepy.    KLINKER. Me--I'm getting awful sleepy, too. (_Stretches and yawns._)    TOMASSO. I wonder what has become of Anita? She said she had a  wonderful secret that was-a verra, verra grand.    MEENY. A secret, Tomasso? (_Goes to him._)    TOMASSO (_standing at C._). Yes, a great, beeg, grand-a secret.    BIDDY MARY (_goes to him and takes his L. arm_). Oh, what is it,  Tomasso?    MEENY (_taking his R. arm_). Yes, Tomasso, tell us vot it is already.    BIDDY MARY (_turning_ TOMASSO _around to face her_). Sure, if there's  anything on earth I _do_ love, it's a secret.    HULDA (_and the other girls, surrounding_ TOMASSO). Yes, Tomasso, tell  us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.    MEENY (_pulling him around to face her_). Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso,  tell us vot it is yet.    TOMASSO (_hesitates_). Well, I----    BIDDY MARY (_pulling him around to face her_). Now, you tell _me_,  Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.    TOMASSO. Well, I----    MEENY (_pulls him around again_). If you're going to tell it, I want  to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.    BIDDY MARY (_pulls him back_). Neither do I.    HULDA. Neither do I.    MEENY. Neither do any of us.    KLINKER. I don't want to miss nothing neither.    SCHWILLIE. No, und I don't neither.    ALL. Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?    TOMASSO (_loudly_). It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.    ALL. Well, what is Anita's secret.    TOMASSO. She wouldn't tell me.    ALL (_turn away very much disappointed_). Oh!    TOMASSO. She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that  would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret. (_All sit  or recline around the stage. Lower the lights._)    SERGIUS. It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in  the middle of the ocean.    KLINKER (_almost asleep_). Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa  Claus comes.    BIDDY MARY (_at R._). Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin'  sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at  all.    SANO SAN. They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my  little lantern in front of the candle.    AH GOO. Allee samee hang mine. (SANO SAN _and_ AH GOO _each give their  lanterns to_ SERGIUS, _who lights them and hangs them on the table.  Note: Nails must be put in the table at R. and L. corners facing front  for these lanterns._)    SERGIUS. I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap.  (_Reclines on floor._) Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as  you hear the bells on his reindeer.    TOMASSO (_yawns_). I wonder what has become of Anita?    HULDA (_stretches_). I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.    OTHERS. So are all of us.    BIDDY MARY. We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's  time we were all of us fast asleep.    ALL (_sing sleepily_).         \"WE'RE ALL NODDIN'.\"    [Music illustration:         1. We are all nod-din', nid, nid nod-din',       We are all nod-din', and drop-ping off to sleep.

William  J. Brown, of Indiana, formerly a member of Congress from that State, and  subsequently published, relates to the events of this period, and  affords nearly contemporaneous evidence in confirmation of the  statements of the text:    \"Washington D.C., _May 7, 1853_.    \"My dear Sir: I received the 'Sentinel' containing your defense of me  against the fate accusation of disunionism, and, before I had returned  to you the thanks to which you are entitled, I received this day the St.  Joseph 'Valley Register,' marked by you, to call my attention to an  article in answer to your defense, which was just in all things, save  your too complimentary terms.    \"I wish I had the letter quoted from, that you might publish the whole  of that which is garbled to answer a purpose. In a part of the letter  not published, I put such a damper on the attempt to fix on me the  desire to break up our Union, and presented other points in a form so  little acceptable to the unfriendly inquirers, that the publication of  the letter had to be drawn out of them.    \"At the risk of being wearisome, but encouraged by your marked  friendship, I will give you a statement in the case. The meeting of  October, 1849, was a convention of delegates equally representing the  Whig and Democratic parties in Mississippi. The resolutions were  decisive as to equality of right in the South with the North to the  Territories acquired from Mexico, and proposed a convention of the  Southern States. I was not a member, but on invitation addressed the  Convention. The succeeding Legislature instructed me, as a Senator, to  assert this equality, and, under the existing circumstances, to resist  by all constitutional means the admission of California as a State. At a  called session of the Legislature in 1850, a self-constituted committee  called on me, by letter, for my views. They were men who had enacted or  approved the resolutions of the Convention of 1849, and instructed me,  as members of the Legislature, in regular session, in the early part of  the year 1850. To them I replied that I adhered to the policy they had  indicated and instructed me in their official character to pursue.    \"I pointed out the mode in which their policy could, in my opinion, be  executed without bloodshed or disastrous convulsion, but in terms of  bitter scorn alluded to such as would insult me with a desire to destroy  the Union, for which my whole life proved me to be a devotee.    \"Pardon the egotism, in consideration of the occasion, when I say to you  that my father and my uncles fought through the Revolution of 1776,  giving their youth, their blood, and their little patrimony to the  constitutional freedom which I claim as my inheritance. Three of my  brothers fought in the war of 1812. Two of them were comrades of the  Hero of the Hermitage, and received his commendation for gallantry at  New Orleans. At sixteen years of age I was given to the service of my  country; for twelve years of my life I have borne its arms and served  it, zealously, if not well. As I feel the infirmities, which suffering  more than age has brought upon me, it would be a bitter reflection,  indeed, if I was forced to conclude that my countrymen would hold all  this light when weighed against the empty panegyric which a time-serving  politician can bestow upon the Union, for which he never made a  sacrifice.    \"In the Senate I announced that, if any respectable man would call me a  disunionist, I would answer him in monosyllables.... But I have often  asserted the right, for which the battles of the Revolution were  fought--the right of a people to change their government whenever it was  found to be oppressive, and subversive of the objects for which  governments are instituted--and have contended for the independence and  sovereignty of the States, a part of the creed of which Jefferson was  the apostle, Madison the expounder, and Jackson the consistent defender.    \"I have written freely, and more than I designed. Accept my thanks for  your friendly advocacy. Present me in terms of kind remembrance to your  family, and believe me, very sincerely yours,    \"Jefferson Davis.    \"Note.--No party in Mississippi ever advocated disunion. They differed  as to the mode of securing their rights in the Union, and on the power  of a State to secede--neither advocating the exercise of the power.    \"J.D.\"  ]          CHAPTER IV.

Happy in the peaceful pursuits of a planter; busily engaged in cares for  servants, in the improvement of my land, in building, in rearing  live-stock, and the like occupations, the time passed pleasantly away  until my retirement was interrupted by an invitation to take a place in  the Cabinet of Mr. Pierce, who had been elected to the Presidency of the  United States in November, 1852. Although warmly attached to Mr. Pierce  personally, and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and  political principles, private and personal reasons led me to decline the  offer. This was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his  inauguration, which took place on the 4th of March, 1853. While in  Washington, on this visit, I was induced by public considerations to  reconsider my determination and accept the office of Secretary of War.  The public records of that period will best show how the duties of that  office were performed.    While in the Senate, I had advocated the construction of a railway to  connect the valley of the Mississippi with the Pacific coast; and, when  an appropriation was made to determine the most eligible route for that  purpose, the Secretary of War was charged with its application. We had  then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of  the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem.  Several different parties were therefore organized to examine the  various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and  southern limits of the United States. The arguments which I had used as  a Senator were \"the military necessity for such means of transportation,  and the need of safe and rapid communication with the Pacific slope, to  secure its continuance as a part of the Union.\"    In the organization and equipment of these parties, and in the selection  of their officers, care was taken to provide for securing full and  accurate information upon every point involved in the determination of  the route. The only discrimination made was in the more prompt and  thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line, and  this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of  execution of all the surveys.    In like manner, my advocacy while in the Senate of an extension of the  Capitol, by the construction of a new Senate-Chamber and Hall of  Representatives, may have caused the appropriation for that object to be  put under my charge as Secretary of War.    During my administration of the War Department, material changes were  made in the models of arms. Iron gun-carriages were introduced, and  experiments were made which led to the casting of heavy guns hollow,  instead of boring them after casting. Inquiries were made with regard to  gunpowder, which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for  artillery.    During the same period the army was increased by the addition of two  regiments of infantry and two of cavalry. The officers of these  regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service  in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life. In making  the selections from the army, I was continually indebted to the  assistance of that pure-minded and accurately informed officer, Colonel  Samuel Cooper, the Adjutant-General, of whom it may be proper here to  say that, although his life had been spent in the army, and he, of  course, had the likes and dislikes inseparable from men who are brought  into close contact and occasional rivalry, I never found in his official  recommendations any indication of partiality or prejudice toward any  one.    When the first list was made out, to be submitted to the President, a  difficulty was found to exist, which had not occurred either to Colonel  Cooper or myself. This was, that the officers selected purely on their  military record did not constitute a roster conforming to that  distribution among the different States, which, for political  considerations, it was thought desirable to observe--that is to say, the  number of such officers of Southern birth was found to be  disproportionately great. Under instructions from the President, the  list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new  element of geographical distribution. This, as I am happy to remember,  was the only occasion in which the current of my official action, while  Secretary of War, was disturbed in any way by sectional or political  considerations.    Under former administrations of the War Office it had not been customary  to make removals or appointments upon political grounds, except in the  case of clerkships. To this usage I not only adhered, but extended it to  include the clerkships also. The Chief Clerk, who had been removed by my  predecessor, had peculiar qualifications for the place; and, although  known to me only officially, he was restored to the"]]]
