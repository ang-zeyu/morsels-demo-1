This, however, would be but a sign of our  favour, and not an indication of any merit it may have inherently  possessed. Thus hath it been revealed in truth by Him Who is the Sovereign  Revealer, the All-Knowing. Consider the Black Stone,(11) which God hath  made a point whereunto all men turn in adoration. Hath this bounty been  conferred upon it by virtue of its innate excellence? Nay, by Mine own  Self! Or doth such distinction stem from its intrinsic worth? Nay, by Mine  own Being, Whose Essence even the wisest and most discerning of men have  failed to grasp!    91 Again, consider the Mosque of Aqsa and the other places which We have  made sanctuaries unto the people in every land and region. The honour and  distinction they enjoy is in no wise due to their own merit, but stemmeth  from their relation to Our Manifestations, Whom We have appointed as the  Daysprings of Our Revelation amidst mankind, if ye be of them that  understand. In this there lieth a wisdom inscrutable to all save God.  Inquire, that He may graciously make plain unto you His purpose. His  knowledge, verily, embraceth all things. Detach yourselves, O people, from  the world and all its vanities, and heed not the call of such as have  disbelieved in God and joined partners with Him. Arise above the horizon  of utterance to extol and praise your Lord, the All-Merciful. This is that  which God hath purposed for you; well is it with them who perceive it.    92 Say: O people! We have commanded you in Our Tablets to strive, at the  time of the promised Revelation, to sanctify your souls from all names,  and to purify them from all that hath been created in the heavens or on  the earth, that therein may appear the splendours of the Sun of Truth  which shineth forth above the horizon of the Will of your Lord, the  Almighty, the Most Great. We have, moreover, commanded you to cleanse your  hearts from every trace of the love or hate of the peoples of the world,  lest aught should divert you from one course or impel you towards another.  This, verily, is among the weightiest counsels I have vouchsafed unto you  in the perspicuous Book, for whoso attacheth himself to either of these  shall be prevented from attaining a proper understanding of Our Cause. To  this beareth witness every just and discerning soul.    93 Ye, however, have broken the Covenant of God, forgotten His Testament,  and at last turned away from Him Whose appearance hath solaced the eyes of  every true believer in the Divine Unity. Lift up the veils and coverings  that obscure your vision, and consider the testimonies of the Prophets and  Messengers, that haply ye may recognize the Cause of God in these days  when the Promised One hath come invested with a mighty sovereignty. Fear  God, and debar yourselves not from Him Who is the Dayspring of His signs.  This shall, in truth, but profit your own selves; as to your Lord, He,  verily, can afford to dispense with all creatures. From everlasting was He  alone; there was none else besides Him. He it is in Whose name the  standard of Divine Unity hath been planted upon the Sinai of the visible  and invisible worlds, proclaiming that there is none other God but Me, the  Peerless, the Glorious, the Incomparable.    94 Behold, however, how those who are but a creation of His Will and  Command have turned aside from Him and have taken unto themselves a lord  and master beside God; these, truly, are of the wayward. The mention of  the All-Merciful hath at all times been upon their lips, and yet when He  was manifested unto them through the power of truth they warred against  Him. Wretched indeed shall be the plight of such as have broken the  Covenant of their Lord when the Luminary of the world shone forth above  the horizon of the Will of God, the Most Holy, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise! It was against God that they unsheathed the swords of malice and  hatred, and yet they perceive it not. Methinks they remain dead and buried  in the tombs of their selfish desires, though the breeze of God hath blown  over all regions. They, truly, are wrapt in a dense and grievous veil. And  oft as the verses of God are rehearsed unto them, they persist in proud  disdain; it is as though they were devoid of all understanding, or had  never heard the Call of God, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.    95 Say: Alas for you! How can ye profess yourselves believers, when ye  deny the verses of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise? Say: O people! Turn  your faces unto your Lord, the All-Merciful. Beware lest ye be veiled by  aught that hath been revealed in the Bayan: It was, in truth, revealed for  no other purpose than to make mention of Me, the All-Powerful, the Most  High, and had no other object than My Beauty. The whole world hath been  filled with My testimony, if ye be of them that judge with fairness.    96 Had the Primal Point been someone else beside Me as ye claim, and had  attained My presence, verily He would have never allowed Himself to be  separated from Me, but rather We would have had mutual delights with each  other in My Days. He, in truth, wept sore in His remoteness from Me. He  preceded Me that He might summon the people unto My Kingdom, as it hath  been set forth in the Tablets, could ye but perceive it! O would that men  of hearing might be found who could hear the voice of His lamentation in  the Bayan bewailing that which hath befallen Me at the hands of these  heedless souls, bemoaning His separation from Me and giving utterance to  His longing to be united with Me, the Mighty, the Peerless. He, verily,  beholdeth at this very moment His Best-Beloved amidst those who were  created to attain His Day and to prostrate themselves before Him, and yet  who have inflicted in their tyranny such abasement upon Him as the pen  confesseth its inability to describe.    97 Say: O people! We, verily, summoned you, in Our former Revelation, unto  this Scene of transcendent glory, this Seat of stainless sanctity, and  announced unto you the advent of the Days of God. Yet, when the most great  veil was rent asunder, and the Ancient Beauty came unto you in the clouds  of God's decree, ye repudiated Him in Whom ye had believed aforetime. Woe  betide you, O company of infidels! Fear ye God, and nullify not the truth  with the things ye possess. When the luminary of divine verses dawneth  upon you from the horizon of the Pen of the King of all names and  attributes, fall ye prostrate upon your faces before God, the Lord of the  Worlds. For to bow down in adoration at the threshold of His door is  indeed better for you than the worship of both worlds, and to submit to  His Revelation is more profitable unto you than whatsoever hath been  created in the heavens and on the earth.    98 Say: O people! I admonish you wholly for the sake of God, and seek no  reward from you. For My recompense shall be with God, He Who hath brought  Me into being, raised Me up by the power of truth, and made Me the Source  of His remembrance amidst His creatures. Hasten to behold this divine and  glorious Vision, the Spot wherein God hath established His Seat. Follow  not that which the Evil One whispereth in your hearts, for he, verily,  doth prompt you to walk after your lusts and covetous desires, and  hindereth you from treading the straight Path which this all-embracing and  all-compelling Cause hath opened.    99 Say: The Evil One hath appeared in such wise as the eye of creation  hath never beheld. He Who is the Beauty of the All-Merciful hath likewise  been made manifest with an adorning the like of which hath never been  witnessed in the past. The Call of the All-Merciful hath been raised, and  behind it the call of Satan. Well is it with them who hearken unto the  Voice of God, and turn their faces towards His throne to behold a most  holy and blessed Vision. For whoso cherisheth in his heart the love of  anyone beside Me, be it to the extent of a grain of mustard seed, shall be  unable to gain admittance into My Kingdom. To this beareth witness that  which adorneth the preamble of the Book of Existence, could ye but  perceive it. Say: This is the Day whereon God's most great favour hath  been made manifest. The voice of all who are in the heavens above and on  the earth below proclaimeth My Name, and singeth forth My praises, could  ye but hear it!    100 O Temple of Divine Revelation! Sound the trumpet in My Name! O Temple  of Divine mysteries! Raise the clarion call of Thy Lord, the  Unconditioned, the Unconstrained! O Maid of Heaven! Step forth from the  chambers of paradise and announce unto the people of the world: By the  righteousness of God! He Who is the Best-Beloved of the worlds--He Who hath  ever been the Desire of every perceiving heart, the Object of the  adoration of all that are in heaven and on earth, and the Cynosure of the  former and the latter generations--is now come!    101 Take heed lest ye hesitate in recognizing this resplendent Beauty when  once He hath appeared in the plenitude of His sovereign might and majesty.  He, verily, is the True One, and all else besides Him is as naught before  a single one of His servants, and paleth into nothingness when brought  face to face with the revelation of His splendours. Hasten, then, to  attain the living waters of His grace, and be not of the negligent. As to  him who hesitateth, though it be for less than a moment, God shall verily  bring his works to naught and return him to the seat of wrath; wretched  indeed is the abode of them that tarry!          Pope Pius IX      102 O Pope! Rend the veils asunder. He Who is the Lord of Lords is come  overshadowed with clouds, and the decree hath been fulfilled by God, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#9)"],[1,"on the                                  _fourth leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: O people of God! Beseech ye  the True One--glorified be His Name--that He may graciously shield the  manifestations of dominion and power from the suggestions of self and  desire and shed the radiance of justice and guidance upon them.    His Majesty Muhammad Shah, despite the excellence of his rank, committed  two heinous deeds. One was the order to banish the Lord of the Realms of  Grace and Bounty, the Primal Point; and the other, the murder of the  Prince of the City of Statesmanship and Literary Accomplishment.(15)    The faults of kings, like their favours, can be great. A king who is not  deterred by the vainglory of power and authority from observing justice,  nor is deprived of the splendours of the day-star of equity by luxury,  riches, glory or the marshalling of hosts and legions shall occupy a high  rank and a sublime station amongst the Concourse on high. It is incumbent  upon everyone to extend aid and to manifest kindness to so noble a soul.  Well is it with the king who keepeth a tight hold on the reins of his  passion, restraineth his anger and preferreth justice and fairness to  injustice and tyranny.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                   _fifth leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: Above all else, the greatest gift  and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be  Wisdom. It is man's unfailing Protector. It aideth him and strengtheneth  him. Wisdom is God's Emissary and the Revealer of His Name the Omniscient.  Through it the loftiness of man's station is made manifest and evident. It  is all-knowing and the foremost Teacher in the school of existence. It is  the Guide and is invested with high distinction. Thanks to its educating  influence earthly beings have become imbued with a gem-like spirit which  outshineth the heavens. In the city of justice it is the unrivalled  Speaker Who, in the year nine, illumined the world with the joyful tidings  of this Revelation. And it was this peerless Source of wisdom that at the  beginning of the foundation of the world ascended the stair of inner  meaning and when enthroned upon the pulpit of utterance, through the  operation of the divine Will, proclaimed two words. The first heralded the  promise of reward, while the second voiced the ominous warning of  punishment. The promise gave rise to hope and the warning begat fear. Thus  the basis of world order hath been firmly established upon these twin  principles. Exalted is the Lord of Wisdom, the Possessor of Great Bounty.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                   _sixth leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: The light of men is  Justice. Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny.  The purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men. The ocean of  divine wisdom surgeth within this exalted word, while the books of the  world cannot contain its inner significance. Were mankind to be adorned  with this raiment, they would behold the day-star of the utterance, 'On  that day God will satisfy everyone out of His abundance,'(16) shining  resplendent above the horizon of the world. Appreciate ye the value of  this utterance; it is a noble fruit that the Tree of the Pen of Glory hath  yielded. Happy is the man that giveth ear unto it and observeth its  precepts. Verily I say, whatever is sent down from the heaven of the Will  of God is the means for the establishment of order in the world and the  instrument for promoting unity and fellowship among its peoples. Thus hath  the Tongue of this Wronged One spoken from His Most Great Prison.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                  _seventh leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: O ye men of wisdom among nations!  Shut your eyes to estrangement, then fix your gaze upon unity. Cleave  tenaciously unto that which will lead to the well-being and tranquillity  of all mankind. This span of earth is but one homeland and one habitation.  It behoveth you to abandon vainglory which causeth alienation and to set  your hearts on whatever will ensure harmony. In the estimation of the  people of Baha man's glory lieth in his knowledge, his upright conduct,  his praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or  rank. O people of the earth! Appreciate the value of this heavenly word.  Indeed it may be likened unto a ship for the ocean of knowledge and a  shining luminary for the realm of perception.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                  _eighth leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: Schools must first train  the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the  Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent them from the things  forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in  such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in  ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.    It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel  together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in  the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to them. God will verily  inspire them with whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Provider,  the Omniscient.    We have formerly ordained that people should converse in two languages,  yet efforts must be made to reduce them to one, likewise the scripts of  the world, that men's lives may not be dissipated and wasted in learning  divers languages. Thus the whole earth would come to be regarded as one  city and one land.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                   _ninth leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: In all matters moderation is  desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of  evil. Consider the civilization of the West, how it hath agitated and  alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath been devised,  and hath proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its like none hath  ever witnessed or heard. The purging of such deeply-rooted and  overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless the peoples of the  world unite in pursuit of one common aim and embrace one universal faith.  Incline your ears unto the Call of this Wronged One and adhere firmly to  the Lesser Peace.    Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from  the minds and the understanding of men. These things are capable of  changing the whole atmosphere of the earth and their contamination would  prove lethal. Great God! We have observed an amazing thing. Lightning or a  force similar to it is controlled by an operator and moveth at his  command. Immeasurably exalted is the Lord of Power Who hath laid bare that  which He purposed through the potency of His weighty and invincible  command.    O people of Baha! Each one of the ordinances We have revealed is a mighty  stronghold for the preservation of the world of being. Verily, this  Wronged One desireth naught but your security and elevation.    We exhort the men of the House of Justice and command them to ensure the  protection and safeguarding of men, women and children. It is incumbent  upon them to have the utmost regard for the interests of the people at all  times and under all conditions. Blessed is the ruler who succoureth the  captive, and the rich one who careth for the poor, and the just one who  secureth from the wrong doer the rights of the downtrodden, and happy the  trustee who observeth that which the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days hath  prescribed unto him.    O Haydar-'Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My praise. My counsels and  admonitions have compassed the world. Yet, instead of imparting joy and  gladness they have caused grief, because some of those who claim to love  Me have waxed haughty and have inflicted upon Me such tribulations as  neither the followers of former religions nor the divines of Persia did  ever inflict.    We have said: 'My imprisonment doeth Me no harm, nor do the things that  have befallen Me at the hands of My enemies. That which harmeth Me is the  conduct of my loved ones who, though they bear My name, yet commit that  which maketh My heart and My pen to lament.' Such utterances as these have  again and again been revealed, yet the heedless have failed to profit  thereby, since they are captive to their own evil passions and corrupt  desires. Beseech thou the One true God that He may enable everyone to  repent and return unto Him. So long as one's nature yieldeth unto evil  passions, crime and transgression will prevail. We cherish the hope that  the hand of divine power and the outpouring of heavenly blessings may  sustain all men, may attire them with the vesture of forgiveness and  bounty and guard them against that which would harm His Cause among His  servants. He is, in truth, the Potent, the All-Powerful, and He is the  Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                   _tenth leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: O people of the earth!  Living in seclusion or practising asceticism is not acceptable in the  presence of God. It behoveth them that are endued with insight and  understanding to observe that which will cause joy and radiance. Such  practices as are sprung from the loins of idle fancy or are begotten of  the womb of superstition ill beseem men of knowledge. In former times and  more recently some people have been taking up their abodes in the caves of  the mountains while others have repaired to graveyards at night. Say, give  ear unto the counsels of this Wronged One. Abandon the things current  amongst you"]]]
