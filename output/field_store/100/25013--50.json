I saw one lance which had accidentally fallen, and it had  gone into the stiff clay soil two feet.    _4th January, 1870._--- The villagers we passed were civil, but like  noisy children, all talked and gazed. When surrounded by 300 or 400,  some who have not been accustomed to the ways of wild men think that a  fight is imminent; but, poor things, no attack is thought of, if it does  not begin on our side. Many of Mohamad's people were dreadfully afraid  of being killed and eaten; one man out in search of ivory seemed to have  lost sight of his companions, for they saw him running with all his  might to a forest with no path in it; he was searched for for several  days, and was given up as a murdered man, a victim of the cannibal  Manyuema! On the seventh day after he lost his head, he was led into  camp by a headman, who not only found him wandering but fed and lodged  and restored him to his people.    [With reference to the above we may add that nothing can exceed the  terror in which cannibal nations are held by other African tribes. It  was common on the River Shire to hear Manganja and Ajawa people speak of  tribes far away to the north who eat human bodies, and on every occasion  the fact was related with the utmost horror and disgust.]    The women here plait the hair into the form of a basket behind; it is  first rolled into a very long coil, then wound round something till it  is about 8 or 10 inches long, projecting from the back of the head.    _5th, 6th, and 7th January, 1870._--Wettings by rain and grass  overhanging our paths, with bad water, brought on choleraic symptoms;  and opium from Mohamad had no effect in stopping it: he, too, had  rheumatism. On suspecting the water as the cause, I had all I used  boiled, and this was effectual, but I was greatly reduced in flesh, and  so were many of our party.    We proceeded nearly due north, through wilderness and many villages and  running rills; the paths are often left to be choked up by the  overbearing vegetation, and then the course of the rill is adopted as  the only clear passage; it has also this advantage, it prevents  footmarks being followed by enemies: in fact the object is always to  make approaches to human dwellings as difficult as possible, even the  hedges around villages sprout out and grow a living fence, and this is  covered by a great mass of a species of calabash with its broad leaves,  so that nothing appears of the fence outside.    _11th January, 1870._--The people are civil, but uproarious from the  excitement of having never seen strangers before; all visitors from a  distance came with their large wooden shields; many of the men are  handsome and tall but the women are plainer than at Bambarre.    _12th January, 1870._--Cross the Lolinde, 35 yards and knee deep,  flowing to join Luamo far down: dark water. (_13th._) Through the hills  Chimunemune; we see many albinos and partial lepers and syphilis is  prevalent. It is too trying to travel during the rains.    _14th January, 1870._--The Muabe palm had taken possession of a broad  valley, and the leaf-stalks, as thick as a strong man's arm and 20 feet  long, had fallen off and blocked up all passage except by one path made  and mixed up by the feet of buffaloes and elephants. In places like this  the leg goes into elephants' holes up to the thigh and it is grievous;  three hours of this slough tired the strongest: a brown stream ran  through the centre, waist deep, and washed off a little of the adhesive  mud. Our path now lay through a river covered with tikatika, a living  vegetable bridge made by a species of glossy leafed grass which felts  itself into a mat capable of bearing a man's weight, but it bends in a  foot or fifteen inches every step; a stick six feet long could not reach  the bottom in certain holes we passed. The lotus, or sacred lily, which  grows in nearly all the shallow waters of this country, sometimes  spreads its broad leaves over the bridge so as to lead careless  observers to think that it is the bridge builder, but the grass  mentioned is the real agent. Here it is called Kintefwetefwe; on  Victoria Nyanza Titatika.    _15th January, 1870._--Choleraic purging again came on till all the  water used was boiled, but I was laid up by sheer weakness near the hill  Chanza.    _20th and 21st January. 1870._--Weakness and illness goes on because we  get wet so often; the whole party suffers, and they say that they will  never come here again. The Manyango Rivulet has fine sweet water, but  the whole country is smothered with luxuriant vegetation.    _27th, 29th, and 30th January, 1870._--Rest from sickness in camp. The  country is indescribable from rank jungle of grass, but the rounded  hills are still pretty; an elephant alone can pass through it--these are  his head-quarters. The stalks are from half an inch to an inch and a  half in diameter, reeds clog the feet, and the leaves rub sorely on the  face and eyes: the view is generally shut in by this megatherium grass,  except when we come to a slope down to a valley or the bed of a rill.    We came to a village among fine gardens of maize, bananas, ground-nuts,  and cassava, but the villagers said, \"Go on to next village;\" and this  meant, \"We don't want you here.\" The main body of Mohamad's people was  about three miles before us, but I was so weak I sat down in the next  hamlet and asked for a hut to rest in. A woman with leprous hands gave  me hers, a nice clean one, and very heavy rain came on: of her own  accord she prepared dumplings of green maize, pounded and boiled; which  are sweet, for she said that she saw I was hungry. It was excessive  weakness from purging, and seeing that I did not eat for fear of the  leprosy, she kindly pressed me: \"Eat, you are weak only from hunger;  this will strengthen you.\" I put it out of her sight, and blessed her  motherly heart.    I had ere this come to the conclusion that I ought not to risk myself  further in the rains in my present weakness, for it may result in  something worse, as in Marungu and Liemba.    The horde mentioned as having passed Bambarre was now somewhere in our  vicinity, and it was impossible to ascertain from the Manyuema where the  Lualaba lay.    In going north on 1st February we came to some of this horde belonging  to Katomba or Moene-mokaia, who stated that the leader was anxious for  advice as to crossing Lualaba and future movements. He supposed that  this river was seven days in front of him, and twelve days in front of  us. It is a puzzle from its north-westing and low level: it is possibly  Petherick's Bahr Ghazal. Could get no latitude.    _2nd February, 1870._--I propose to cross it, and buy an exploring  canoe, because I am recovering my strength; but we now climb over the  bold hills Bininango, and turn south-west towards Katomba to take  counsel: he knows more than anyone else about the country, and his  people being now scattered everywhere seeking ivory, I do not relish  their company.    _3rd February, 1870._--Caught in a drenching rain, which made me fain to  sit, exhausted as I was, under an umbrella for an hour trying to keep  the trunk dry. As I sat in the rain a little tree-frog, about half an  inch long, leaped on to a grassy leaf, and began a tune as loud as that  of many birds, and very sweet; it was surprising to hear so much music  out of so small a musician. I drank some rain-water as I felt faint--in  the paths it is now calf deep. I crossed a hundred yards of slush waist  deep in mid channel, and full of holes made by elephants' feet, the path  hedged in by reedy grass, often intertwined and very tripping. I  stripped off my clothes on reaching my hut in a village, and a fire  during night nearly dried them. At the same time I rubbed my legs with  palm oil, and in the morning had a delicious breakfast of sour goat's  milk and porridge.    _5th February, 1870._--The drenching told on me sorely, and it was  repeated after we had crossed the good-sized rivulets Mulunkula and many  villages, and I lay on an enormous boulder under a Muabe palm, and slept  during the worst of the pelting. I was seven days southing to Mamohela,  Katomba's camp, and quite knocked up and exhausted. I went into winter  quarters on 7th February, 1870.    _7th February, 1870._--This was the camp of the headman of the ivory  horde now away for ivory. Katomba, as Moene-mokaia is called, was now all  kindness. We were away from his Ujijian associates, and he seemed to  follow his natural bent without fear of the other slave-traders, who all  hate to see me as a spy on their proceedings. Rest, shelter, and boiling  all the water I used, and above all the new species of potato called  Nyumbo, much famed among the natives as restorative, soon put me all to  rights. Katomba supplied me liberally with nyumbo; and, but for a  slightly medicinal taste, which is got rid of by boiling in two waters,  this vegetable would be equal to English potatoes.    _11th February, 1870._--First of all it was proposed to go off to the  Lualaba in the north-west, in order to procure _Holcus sorghum_ or dura  flour, that being, in Arab opinion, nearly equal to wheat, or as they  say \"heating,\" while the maize flour we were obliged to use was cold or  cooling.    _13th February, 1870._--I was too ill to go through mud waist deep, so I  allowed Mohamad (who was suffering much) to go away alone in search of  ivory. As stated above, shelter and nyumbo proved beneficial.    _22nd February, 1870._--Falls between Vira and Baker's Water seen by  Wanyamwezi. This confirms my conjecture on finding Lualaba at a lower  level than Tanganyika. Bin Habib went to fight the Batusi, but they were  too strong, and he turned.    _1st March, 1870._--Visited my Arab friends in their camp for the first  time to-day. This is Kasessa's country, and the camp is situated between  two strong rivulets,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#9)"],[1,"sorry to have robbed you of a pleasant chase,\" said I. \"At one  time I should have been the first to join you. But, to tell you the  truth, I've had enough excitement lately to last me for my life.\"    \"I can believe that,\" he answered, with his fine eyes full upon me.  How strangely I had misjudged him! I saw no vulgar curiosity in his  flattering gaze, but rather that very sympathy of which I stood in need.  I offered him my hand.    \"It is very good of you to give in,\" I said. \"No one else has heard a  thing, you see. I shall look for another opportunity of thanking you  to-morrow.\"    \"No, no!\" cried he, \"thanks be hanged, but--but, I say, if I promise  you not to bore you about things--won't you drink a glass of  brandy-and-water in my room before you turn in again?\"    Brandy-and-water being the very thing I needed, and this young man  pleasing me more and more, I said that I would join him with all my  heart, and returned to my room for my dressing-gown and slippers. To  find them, however, I had to light my candles, when the first thing  I saw was the havoc my marauder had left behind him. The mirror was  cracked across; the dressing-table had lost a leg; and both lay flat,  with my brushes and shaving-table, and the foolish toilet crockery which  no one uses (but I should have to replace) strewn upon the carpet. But  one thing I found that had not been there before: under the window lay  a formidable sheath-knife without its sheath. I picked it up with  something of a thrill, which did not lessen when I felt its edge. The  thing was diabolically sharp. I took it with me to show my neighbor,  whom I found giving his order to the boots; it seemed that it was barely  midnight, and that he had only just come in when the clatter took place  in my room.    \"Hillo!\" he cried, when the man was gone, and I produced my trophy.  \"Why, what the mischief have you got there?\"    \"My caller's card,\" said I. \"He left it behind him. Feel the edge.\"    I have seldom seen a more indignant face than the one which my new  acquaintance bent over the weapon, as he held it to the light, and ran  his finger along the blade. He could have not frowned more heavily if he  had recognized the knife.    \"The villains!\" he muttered. \"The damned villains!\"    \"Villains?\" I queried. \"Did you see more than one of them, then?\"    \"Didn't you?\" he asked quickly. \"Yes, yes, to be sure! There was at  least one other beggar skulking down below.\" He stood looking at me, the  knife in his hand, though mine was held out for it. \"Don't you think,  Mr. Cole, that it's our duty to hand this over to the police? I--I've  heard of other cases about these Inns of Court. There's evidently a gang  of them, and this knife might convict the lot; there's no saying; anyway  I think the police should have it. If you like I'll take it to Scotland  Yard myself, and hand it over without mentioning your name.\"    \"Oh, if you keep my name out of it,\" said I, \"and say nothing about  it here in the hotel, you may do what you like, and welcome! It's the  proper course, no doubt; only I've had publicity enough, and would  sooner have felt that blade in my body than set my name going again in  the newspapers.\"    \"I understand,\" he said, with his well-bred sympathy, which never went  a shade too far; and he dropped the weapon into a drawer, as the boots  entered with the tray. In a minute he had brewed two steaming jorums of  spirits-and-water; as he handed me one, I feared he was going to drink  my health, or toast my luck; but no, he was the one man I had met who  seemed, as he said, to \"understand.\" Nevertheless, he had his toast.    \"Here's confusion to the criminal classes in general,\" he cried; \"but  death and damnation to the owners of that knife!\"    And we clinked tumblers across the little oval table in the middle of  the room. It was more of a sitting-room than mine; a bright fire was  burning in the grate, and my companion insisted on my sitting over it  in the arm-chair, while for himself he fetched the one from his bedside,  and drew up the table so that our glasses should be handy. He then  produced a handsome cigar-case admirably stocked, and we smoked and  sipped in the cosiest fashion, though without exchanging many words.    You may imagine my pleasure in the society of a youth, equally charming  in looks, manners and address, who had not one word to say to me about  the Lady Jermyn or my hen-coop. It was unique. Yet such, I suppose,  was my native contrariety, that I felt I could have spoken of the  catastrophe to this very boy with less reluctance than to any other  creature whom I had encountered since my deliverance. He seemed so full  of silent sympathy: his consideration for my feelings was so marked and  yet so unobtrusive. I have called him a boy. I am apt to write as the  old man I have grown, though I do believe I felt older then than now.  In any case my young friend was some years my junior. I afterwards found  out that he was six-and-twenty.    I have also called him handsome. He was the handsomest man that I have  ever met, had the frankest face, the finest eyes, the brightest smile.  Yet his bronzed forehead was low, and his mouth rather impudent and bold  than truly strong. And there was a touch of foppery about him, in the  enormous white tie and the much-cherished whiskers of the fifties, which  was only redeemed by that other touch of devilry that he had shown me  in the corridor. By the rich brown of his complexion, as well as by a  certain sort of swagger in his walk, I should have said that he was a  naval officer ashore, had he not told me who he was of his own accord.    \"By the way,\" he said, \"I ought to give you my name. It's Rattray,  of one of the many Kirby Halls in this country. My one's down in  Lancashire.\"    \"I suppose there's no need to tell my name?\" said I, less sadly, I  daresay, than I had ever yet alluded to the tragedy which I alone  survived. It was an unnecessary allusion, too, as a reference to the  foregoing conversation will show.    \"Well, no!\" said he, in his frank fashion; \"I can't honestly say there  is.\"    We took a few puffs, he watching the fire, and I his firelit face.    \"It must seem strange to you to be sitting with the only man who lived  to tell the tale!\"    The egotism of this speech was not wholly gratuitous. I thought it did  seem strange to him: that a needless constraint was put upon him by  excessive consideration for my feelings. I desired to set him at his  ease as he had set me at mine. On the contrary, he seemed quite startled  by my remark.    \"It is strange,\" he said, with a shudder, followed by the biggest sip  of brandy-and-water he had taken yet. \"It must have been  horrible--horrible!\" he added to himself, his dark eyes staring into the  fire.    \"Ah!\" said I, \"it was even more horrible than you suppose or can ever  imagine.\"    I was not thinking of myself, nor of my love, nor of any particular  incident of the fire that still went on burning in my brain. My tone was  doubtless confidential, but I was meditating no special confidence when  my companion drew one with his next words. These, however, came after a  pause, in which my eyes had fallen from his face, but in which I heard  him emptying his glass.    \"What do you mean?\" he whispered. \"That there were other  circumstances--things which haven't got into the papers?\"    \"God knows there were,\" I answered, my face in my hands; and, my  grief brought home to me, there I sat with it in the presence of that  stranger, without compunction and without shame.    He sprang up and paced the room. His tact made me realize my weakness,  and I was struggling to overcome it when he surprised me by suddenly  stopping and laying a rather tremulous hand upon my shoulder.    \"You--It wouldn't do you any good to speak of those circumstances, I  suppose?\" he faltered.    \"No: not now: no good at all.\"    \"Forgive me,\" he said, resuming his walk. \"I had no business--I felt so  sorry--I cannot tell you how I sympathize! And yet--I wonder if you will  always feel so?\"    \"No saying how I shall feel when I am a man again,\" said I. \"You see  what I am at present.\" And, pulling myself together, I rose to find my  new friend quite agitated in his turn.    \"I wish we had some more brandy,\" he sighed. \"I'm afraid it's too late  to get any now.\"    \"And I'm glad of it,\" said I. \"A man in my state ought not to look at  spirits, or he may never look past them again. Thank goodness, there are  other medicines. Only this morning I consulted the best man on nerves in  London. I wish I'd gone to him long ago.\"    \"Harley Street, was it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Saw you on his doorstep, by Jove!\" cried Rattray at once. \"I was  driving over to Hampstead, and I thought it was you. Well, what's the  prescription?\"    In my satisfaction at finding that he had not been dogging me  intentionally (though I had forgotten the incident till he reminded me  of it), I answered his question with unusual fulness.    \"I should go abroad,\" said Rattray. \"But then, I always am abroad; it's  only the other day I got back from South America, and I shall up anchor  again before this filthy English winter sets in.\"    Was he a sailor after all, or only a well-to-do wanderer on the face of  the earth? He now mentioned that he was only in England for a few weeks,  to have a look at his estate, and so forth; after which he plunged into  more or less enthusiastic advocacy of this or that foreign resort, as  opposed to the English cottage upon which I told him I had set my heart.    He was now, however, less spontaneous, I thought, than earlier in the  night. His voice had lost its hearty ring, and he seemed preoccupied, as  if talking of one matter while he thought upon another. Yet he would  not let me go; and presently he confirmed my suspicion, no less than my  first impression of his delightful frankness and cordiality, by candidly  telling me what was on his mind.    \"If you"]]]
