Chop  the giblets quite fine, put them in a frying pan over the fire with four  ounces of butter, two breakfast cups of stale breadcrumbs and a good  seasoning of salt, pepper and any powdered sweet herbs except sage. Stir  all these ingredients together until they are of a light brown, add a  wine glass of sherry or Madeira wine, and the force meat is ready for  use.      ~PICKLED PORK STUFFING FOR TURKEYS~--Chop up very fine a quarter of a  pound of fat and lean salted pork, break quite fine a couple of  breakfast cupfuls of bread and put them in a frying pan over the fire  with two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, fry to a brown and season  with salt, pepper and any sweet herbs except sage.      ~POTATO STUFFING~--Cut some peeled raw potatoes into slices of moderate  thickness and then cut into squares, rinse with cold water, drain and  place them in a saucepan with a couple of ounces of butter, a chopped  onion and one or two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, a little salt  and pepper and grated nutmeg, place the lid on the pan, keeping the pan  at the side of the fire and shaking contents occasionally until nearly  cooked, then chop fine an equal quantity of pig's liver and stir into  the potatoes a few minutes before serving.    ~STUFFING FOR BIRDS~--Peel two large onions, parboil them, then drain  and chop them fine. Soak one breakfast cup of bread crumbs in as much  milk as they will absorb without becoming too soft. Pour four ounces of  butter in a stewpan, place it over the fire, and when the butter is  melted put in the onions, breadcrumbs and one tablespoon of chopped  parsley, pepper and salt to taste. Add a small quantity of grated  nutmeg. Add the beaten yolks of two eggs and stir the mixture over the  fire until it is reduced to a paste, without allowing it to boil. The  stuffing is then ready. It can be made in larger or smaller quantities  according to the number of the birds to be stuffed.      ~STUFFING FOR BOILED TURKEY OR RABBIT~--Remove the outer peel of one  pound of chestnuts, then put them in boiling water until the inner skins  can easily be removed, then trim them and put them into small lined  saucepan, cover them with broth and boil until the pulp and the broth  has been well reduced. Pass the chestnuts through a fine wire sieve.  Chop fine one-fourth pound of cold boiled fat bacon and mix it with the  chestnut puree, season to taste with salt, pepper and minced lemon peel.  The stuffing will then be ready to serve.      ~STUFFING FOR DUCKS~--Peel a fair size onion and sour cooking apple,  chop them both very fine, and mix them with six ounces of finely grated  stale breadcrumbs, one scant tablespoonful of sage leaves either  powdered or finely mixed, one tablespoon butter, a little salt and  butter. Bind the whole together with a beaten egg and it is then ready  for the ducks.      ~STUFFING FOR FISH~--Weigh two pounds of breadcrumbs without the crusts,  and cut it into small squares, mix in one-half tablespoon of powdered  curry and a liberal quantity of salt and pepper. Dissolve six ounces of  butter in one-half pint of warm water and beat in the yolks of four  eggs. Pour the liquid mixture over the bread and stir it well, but do  not mash it. It is then ready to serve.      ~STUFFING FOR FOWLS~--Trim off the crusts from two pounds of bread, put  the crumbs into a basin of cold water, soak it for five minutes then  turn it onto a sieve and drain well, pressing out the water with a  plate. When nearly dry cut the bread into small squares and season it  well with powdered sage, salt and pepper. Warm one breakfast cupful of  butter, beat in an egg and three teacupfuls of warm water and pour it  over the bread, stirring it lightly, but not mashing it. Allow it to  soak for ten minutes and the stuffing will then be ready to serve.      ~STUFFING FOR GOOSE~--Roast fifty chestnuts, using care not to let them  burn, remove the inner and outer peels and chop them fine. Chop the  goose's liver, put it in a saucepan with one-half tablespoonful of  chopped parsley, shallots, chives, and a little garlic and about two  ounces of butter, fry them for a few minutes, then put in the chopped  chestnuts with one pound of sausage meat, and fry the whole for fifteen  minutes longer. The stuffing is then ready for use.      ~STUFFING FOR POULTRY~--Put two handfuls of rice into a saucepan of  water and parboil it, mix in ten or twelve chestnuts peeled or cut into  small slices, one pan full of pistachio nuts and one handful of  currants. Put the mixture in a saucepan with four ounces of butter, stir  it well over the fire until thoroughly incorporated, season with pepper  and salt and if liked a little ground cinnamon, and it is then ready for  use. This stuffing is used for turkeys and other birds or anything else  that is roasted whole.      ~STUFFING FOR POULTRY GALANTINE~--Cut into squares three pounds of  cooked flesh of either ducks or fowls; peel and chop two hard boiled  eggs and one medium-size onion. Mix all of these together with three  breakfast cupfuls of stale breadcrumbs, three well beaten eggs and  one-half cupful of poultry fat that has been warmed; season to taste  with pepper, salt and sage. After the force meat has been spread in the  boned duck, or other bird, about one cupful of chopped jelly strewn over  it will be an improvement and will set in the force meat.      ~STUFFING FOR RABBITS~--Peel two onions and boil, when they are tender  drain and mince them. Chop one-half pound pickled pork and few fine  herbs, stir them in with the onions, then stir in the yolks of two eggs  and add a sufficient quantity breadcrumbs to make it fairly consistent.  Season to taste with pepper and salt, using a very little of the latter  on account of the salt in the pork. Then stuffing is ready for use.      ~STUFFING FOR A SUCKLING PIG AND 'POSSUM~--Put two tablespoonfuls of  finely chopped onions into a saucepan with one teaspoon of oil. Toss  them over the fire for five or six minutes, add eight ounces of rice  boiled in stock, an equal quantity of sausage meat, four or five ounces  of butter, a small quantity of minced parsley, and pepper and salt to  taste. Turn the mixture into a basin and add three eggs to make the  whole into a stiff paste. It is then ready for use.      ~STUFFING FOR TURKEY (ROASTED)~--To one pound of sifted breadcrumbs add  one-half pound of butter, one pound of boiled and mashed potatoes and a  little summer savory rubbed to a fine powder, add sufficient eggs to  stiffen and season with salt, pepper and grated nutmeg. A little sausage  meat, grated ham and a few oysters or chopped mushrooms may be added;  they are a marked improvement, as are also a few walnuts roasted,  chestnuts and filberts, and the same may also be served in the gravy  with the bird.      ~STUFFING FOR VEAL~--Trim off the skin and mince fine one-fourth pound  of beef suet. Mix with it one cupful of bread crumbs, one tablespoonful  of chopped parsley, two tablespoons of finely minced ham and the grated  peel of a lemon. Season the stuffing to taste with pepper and salt and  bind it with one beaten egg. It is then ready to use.      ~TRUFFLE AND CHESTNUT STUFFING~--Peel off the thick outer skin of the  chestnuts, pat them into a saucepan with a bay leaf, a lump of salt, and  plenty of coriander seeds. Cover them with water, and boil until nearly  tender. Drain the chestnuts and peel off the inner skin, for every half  pound of chestnuts, weighed after they are boiled and peeled, allow  one-half pound of bacon, one-quarter pound of truffles, and the  chestnuts all cut up into small pieces; season to taste with salt,  pepper and spices and add a little each of powdered thyme and marjoram;  toss the mixture for a few minutes longer over the fire and it is then  ready for use.      ~TRUFFLE STUFFING FOR TURKEY~--Brush well one and one-half pounds of  truffles, peel them, mince the peel very fine, cut the truffles into  slices, put them all into a saucepan with one-quarter pound of minced  fat bacon and any obtainable fat from the turkey. Also a good size lump  of butter, with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for ten minutes and let  it get cold before using. A turkey should be stuffed with this three  days before it is cooked, and truffle sauce should accompany it.      ~ENGLISH STUFFING~--First, take some stale bread (use your own judgment  as to the quantity), and brown it in your oven. Also one onion (red ones  preferred), a quarter of a pound of fresh pork, or sausages, and run it  through your meat grinder with a few stalks of celery; place it in a  saucepan, in which a small lump of butter has been dissolved. Beat one  or two eggs in a pint of sweet milk. Stir all ingredients well. Place  on the fire or in the oven and continue to stir, so as to see that the  onions are cooked. After you have this done set in a cool place; when  the above articles are cold, place inside the turkey. Your seasoning  that you place in the turkey, or make your gravy with, is sufficient.  Roast it in the same way as you have done in the past.          LUNCH DISHES      ~BREAD, WITH CREAM CHEESE FILLING~--For this use the steamed Boston  brown bread and a potato loaf of white. Take the crust from the white  loaf, using a sharp knife. Then instead of cutting crosswise cut in thin  lengthwise pieces. Treat the brown loaf in the same way. Butter a slice  of the white bread on one side and do the same with a brown slice. Put  the two buttered sides together with a thin layer of fresh cream cheese  between. Next butter the top of the brown slice of bread, spread again  with cream cheese and lay a second slice of buttered white bread on top.  Repeat until there are five layers, having the white last. Now with a  sharp knife cut crosswise in thin slices. Sometimes the cream cheese  filling can be varied with chopped pistachio nuts or olives, or it can  be omitted entirely.

Hamilton and others use  'Extension' in the sense of Denotation, and 'Intension' or  'Comprehension' in the sense of Connotation. Now, terms may be  classified, first according to what they stand for or denote; that is,  according to their _Denotation_. In this respect, the use of a term is  said to be either Concrete or Abstract.    A term is Concrete when it denotes a 'thing'; that is, any person,  object, fact, event, feeling or imagination, considered as capable of  having (or consisting of) qualities and a determinate existence. Thus  'cricket ball' denotes any object having a certain size, weight, shape,  colour, etc. (which are its qualities), and being at any given time in  some place and related to other objects--in the bowler's hands, on the  grass, in a shop window. Any 'feeling of heat' has a certain intensity,  is pleasurable or painful, occurs at a certain time, and affects some  part or the whole of some animal. An imagination, indeed (say, of a  fairy), cannot be said in the same sense to have locality; but it  depends on the thinking of some man who has locality, and is definitely  related to his other thoughts and feelings.    A term is Abstract, on the other hand, when it denotes a quality (or  qualities), considered by itself and without determinate existence in  time, place, or relation to other things. 'Size,' 'shape,' 'weight,'  'colour,' 'intensity,' 'pleasurableness,' are terms used to denote such  qualities, and are then abstract in their denotation. 'Weight' is not  something with a determinate existence at a given time; it exists not  merely in some particular place, but wherever there is a heavy thing;  and, as to relation, at the same moment it combines in iron with  solidity and in mercury with liquidity. In fact, a quality is a point of  agreement in a multitude of different things; all heavy things agree in  weight, all round things in roundness, all red things in redness; and an  abstract term denotes such a point (or points) of agreement among the  things denoted by concrete terms. Abstract terms result from the  analysis of concrete things into their qualities; and conversely a  concrete term may be viewed as denoting the synthesis of qualities into  an individual thing. When several things agree in more than one quality,  there may be an abstract term denoting the union of qualities in which  they agree, and omitting their peculiarities; as 'human nature' denotes  the common qualities of men, 'civilisation' the common conditions of  civilised peoples.    Every general name, if used as a concrete term, has, or may have, a  corresponding abstract term. Sometimes the concrete term is modified to  form the abstract, as 'greedy--greediness'; sometimes a word is adapted  from another language, as 'man--humanity'; sometimes a composite term is  used, as 'mercury--the nature of mercury,' etc. The same concrete may  have several abstract correlatives, as 'man--manhood, humanity, human  nature'; 'heavy--weight, gravity, ponderosity'; but in such cases the  abstract terms are not used quite synonymously; that is, they imply  different ways of considering the concrete.    Whether a word is used as a concrete or abstract term is in most  instances plain from the word itself, the use of most words being pretty  regular one way or the other; but sometimes we must judge by the  context. 'Weight' may be used in the abstract for 'gravity,' or in the  concrete for a measure; but in the latter sense it is syncategorematic  (in the singular), needing at least the article 'a (or the) weight.'  'Government' may mean 'supreme political authority,' and is then  abstract; or, the men who happen to be ministers, and is then concrete;  but in this case, too, the article is usually prefixed. 'The life' of  any man may mean his vitality (abstract), as in \"Thus following life in  creatures we dissect\"; or, the series of events through which he passes  (concrete), as in 'the life of Nelson as narrated by Southey.'    It has been made a question whether the denotation of an abstract term  may itself be the subject of qualities. Apparently 'weight' may be  greater or less, 'government' good or bad, 'vitality' intense or dull.  But if every subject is modified by a quality, a quality is also  modified by making it the subject of another; and, if so, it seems then  to become a new quality. The compound terms 'great weight,' 'bad  government,' 'dull vitality,' have not the same denotation as the simple  terms 'weight, 'government,' 'vitality': they imply, and may be said to  connote, more special concrete experience, such as the effort felt in  lifting a trunk, disgust at the conduct of officials, sluggish movements  of an animal when irritated. It is to such concrete experiences that we  have always to refer in order fully to realise the meaning of abstract  terms, and therefore, of course, to understand any qualification of  them.    Sec. 5. Concrete terms may be subdivided according to the number of things  they denote and the way in which they denote them. A term may denote one  thing or many: if one, it is called Singular; if many, it may do so  distributively, and then it is General; or, as taken all together, and  then it is Collective: one, then; any one of many; many in one.    Among Singular Terms, each denoting a single thing, the most obvious are  Proper Names, such as Gibraltar or George Washington, which are merely  marks of individual things or persons, and may form no part of the  common language of a country. They are thus distinguished from other  Singular Terms, which consist of common words so combined as to restrict  their denotation to some individual, such as, 'the strongest man on  earth.'    Proper Terms are often said to be arbitrary signs, because their use  does not depend upon any reason that may be given for them. Gibraltar  had a meaning among the Moors when originally conferred; but no one now  knows what it was, unless he happens to have learned it; yet the name  serves its purpose as well as if it were \"Rooke's Nest.\" Every Newton  or Newport year by year grows old, but to alter the name would cause  only confusion. If such names were given by mere caprice it would make  no difference; and they could not be more cumbrous, ugly, or absurd than  many of those that are given 'for reasons.'    The remaining kinds of Singular Terms are drawn from the common  resources of the language. Thus the pronouns 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' are  singular terms, whose present denotation is determined by the occasion  and context of discourse: so with demonstrative phrases--'the man,'  'that horse.' Descriptive names may be more complex, as 'the wisest man  of Gotham,' which is limited to some individual by the superlative  suffix; or 'the German Emperor,' which is limited by the definite  article--the general term 'German Emperor' being thereby restricted  either to the reigning monarch or to the one we happen to be discussing.  Instead of the definite, the indefinite article may be used to make  general terms singular, as 'a German Emperor was crowned at Versailles'  (_individua vaga_).    Abstract Terms are ostensively singular: 'whiteness' (e.g.) is one  quality. But their full meaning is general: 'whiteness' stands for all  white things, so far as white. Abstract terms, in fact, are only  formally singular.    General Terms are words, or combinations of words, used to denote any  one of many things that resemble one another in certain respects.  'George III.' is a Singular Term denoting one man; but 'King' is a  General Term denoting him and all other men of the same rank; whilst the  compound 'crowned head' is still more general, denoting kings and also  emperors. It is the nature of a general term, then, to be used in the  same sense of whatever it denotes; and its most characteristic form is  the Class-name, whether of objects, such as 'king,' 'sheep,' 'ghost'; or  of events, such as 'accession,' 'purchase,' 'manifestation.' Things and  events are known by their qualities and relations; and every such  aspect, being a point of resemblance to some other things, becomes a  ground of generalisation, and therefore a ground for the need and use of  general terms. Hence general terms are far the most important sort of  terms in Logic, since in them general propositions are expressed and,  moreover (with rare exceptions), all predicates are general. For,  besides these typical class-names, attributive words are general terms,  such as 'royal,' 'ruling,' 'woolly,' 'bleating,' 'impalpable,'  'vanishing.'    Infinitives may also be used as general terms, as '_To err is human_';  but for logical purposes they may have to be translated into equivalent  substantive forms, as _Foolish actions are characteristic of mankind_.  Abstract terms, too, are (as I observed) equivalent to general terms;  'folly' is abstract for 'foolish actions.' '_Honesty is the best  policy_' means _people who are honest may hope to find their account in  being so_; that is, in the effects of their honest actions, provided  they are wise in other ways, and no misfortunes attend them. The  abstract form is often much the more succinct and forcible, but for  logical treatment it needs to be interpreted in the general form.    By antonomasia proper names may become general terms, as if we say _'A  Johnson' would not have written such a book_--i.e., any man of his  genius for elaborate eloquence.    A Collective Term denotes a multitude of similar things considered as  forming one whole, as 'regiment,' 'flock,' 'nation': not distributively,  that is, not the similar things severally; to denote them we must say  'soldiers of the regiment,' 'sheep of the flock,' and so on. If in a  multitude of things there is no resemblance, except the fact of being  considered as parts of one whole, as 'the world,' or 'the town of  Nottingham' (meaning its streets and houses, open spaces, people, and "]]]
