It is also the  product of the first male and female numbers, and was anciently called  the number of the world--repeated anyhow by an odd multiple it always  reappears.    If now we consider chemistry as that science which has to deal with the  changes and combinations of the five elements, and if we call it--    _The science of the five parts or elements_, should we not, when we find  that the Arabic word for five is _khams_, rather refer the name of our  science to this word khams, and read it as        _Al-Khams_,    The five-part science?    I am inclined, however, to go yet a step further, and remembering that  the _fifth_ element or Ether of the most ancient Hindoo philosophy, was  in reality an expression for active force, or, that emanating from the  central sun caused the natural phenomena of attraction and repulsion,  the emission and refraction of light, and other sensible changes of  condition, would read the compound word      _Al-Khamis_    (The fifth),    as the grand and simple title of our ancient science, meaning      _The force_--    that which causes the changes in the elementary types and their  combinations--than which no more descriptive title could be assigned to  it, even in the present enlightened age.           *       *       *       *       *             *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *    Errors and Anomalies    Apollonius Tyanaeus  [_text reads \"Appolonius\"_]    Hercules and Bacchus (Dionysius)  [_text reads \"Dionsyius\"_]    Ommiades ...

After numerous encounters between the Romans and the  Gauls, the latter were at length wholly subdued about 50 years before  Christ, and although the records of this ancient people date nearly as  far back as the foundation of Rome, yet our first accounts of Paris are  derived from Caesar and Strabo, who allude to it under the name of  Lutetia, the principal city of the Parisii; and from the most probable  statements which could be collected from aged persons at that period, it  is presumed that its foundation must have occurred not more than half a  century antecedent. It is supposed that the ground which Paris now  occupies formerly consisted of a number of small hills, which in the  process of time, building, paving, etc., have been somewhat reduced, by  the summits having been in a degree levelled; and the houses upon them  being generally not so high as those in the lower parts, the eminences  are not now so apparent. These hillocks were called by the French  _buttes_, and some of them are still very perceptible, such as in the  _rue des Saints-Peres_, by the _rue St-Guillaume_, the _rue Meslay_, the  _rue de l'Observance_, near the _Ecole de Medecine_, and several other  places; indeed, on each side of the Seine Paris rises as you proceed to  the _Faubourgs_. Some of these little hills still bear the name of  _butte_, as _les Buttes St-Chaumont, la rue des Buttes_, etc., but the  most ancient part of Paris is that which is now termed La Cite and is  confined to an island formed by the Seine, and which is joined to the  opposite banks by the _Pont-Neuf_ (or New-Bridge), but certainly no  longer meriting that title, having been built in the reign of Henry the  Third about the year 1580. There are many histories of Paris which have  been handed down by oral record to some of the earliest authors amongst  the Gauls, but so ill authenticated that they do not merit repetition,  having being reputed as fabulous by most writers to whom credit can be  attached. There is, however, one account of the foundation of Paris  which may be cited more for its comic ingenuity than for its veracity,  beginning by tracing the Trojans to Samothes, the son of Japhet and  grandson of Noah; then following in the same line, they endeavour to  prove that at the destruction of Troy, Francus, the son of Hector, fled  to Gaul, of which he became king and no doubt bestowed upon it the name  of France, as the French have a most happy knack of cutting off the _us_  at the end of names as, Titus Livius and Quintus Curtius they have  metamorphosed into Tite-Live and Quinte-Curce, and in fact with one or  two exceptions they have abbreviated the terminations of the ancient  Greek and Roman appellations entirely according to their own fashion.  This fortunate youth, Francus, at length fixed his abode in Champagne,  and built the town of Troyes, calling it after his native place, which  having accomplished, he repaired to the borders of the Seine and ever  partial to Trojan associations, built a city which he called Paris after  his uncle.    However agreeable it may prove to the feelings of the Parisians to trace  their origin to the remotest antiquity, yet common sense suggests that  the account of the foundation of their city which is the most rational,  is that which is deduced from the Commentaries of Julius Caesar, he  having been at some pains to ascertain from whence the Parisii sprung,  and was informed by persons who remembered the epoch, that they were a  people who had emigrated from their native country in consequence of the  persecutions and massacres of their enemies, and that they were supposed  to have belonged to some of the petty nations known under the common  appellation of the Belgae, and arriving on the borders of the Seine  requested permission of the Senones, a powerful people of the Gauls, to  establish themselves on the frontiers of their territory, and place  themselves under their protection, agreeing at the same time to conform  to the laws of those whose hospitality they sought. That they were but a  very inconsiderable people on the arrival of Caesar is proved by the  small contingent of warriors they were required to supply by the Gauls,  in their struggles against the Romans. The territory accorded to the  Parisii could not have exceeded more than ten or twelve leagues,  adjoining to the lands of a people termed Silvanectes on the one side,  and to those of the Carnutes on the other. It is conjectured that the  name of Parisii received its etymology from their being a people who  inhabited the borders, as Par and Bar are synonymous from the P and the  B having had the same signification, and which are often confused  together at the present time by the Germans; and Barisii or Barrisenses,  signifying a people inhabiting a space between other nations, hence it  is inferred that the Parisii received that appellation from their  occupying a spot on the frontiers of the Senones, separating them from  the Silvanectes and the Carnutes. Amongst the many suppositions which  have been formed as to the origin of the name of the Parisii, perhaps  the above is the most rational. Paris, or Lutetia, soon after the  conquest by Caesar became a place of importance, as he selected that city  for a convocation of the different powers of Gaul when he required of  them supplies for his cavalry; and a short time after, when the Gallic  nation revolted from Caesar's dominion, one of the most decided battles  which was fought was within sight of Paris, under Labienus, the Roman  general, whilst the chief of the Gauls, Camulogene, perished in the  combat with a considerable portion of his men, but the greater number  saved themselves by taking shelter in Paris, which was not attacked,  Labienus himself retreating to Agedineum. But although Caesar fixed upon  Paris as the most convenient locality for the meeting of the Gallic  chiefs, yet it was little more than a fort like all the other towns in  Gaul, into which the natives retreated in the time of war with their  females, children, cattle and moveables; as they were accustomed in  time of peace to live in detached habitation in the midst of their  flocks, their pastures and their cornfields, only retreating within  their forts or cities for security when attacked. After the fall of  Camulogene, Gaul soon returned to the Roman yoke and Paris subsequently  became the residence of their prefects, governors and even emperors. In  1818, in digging deeply in the streets of Monceau and Martroi, near the  church of Saint Gervais, an ancient cemetery was discovered. In one of  the tombs was found a silver medal, in which a head was visible on one  side, and a head crowned on the other, having this inscription,  _Antonius Pius Aug._, who reigned from the years 138 to 161. It is  inferred from this circumstance, that the burying-place was of coeval  antiquity, but notwithstanding the many battles which occurred between  the Gauls and the Romans, Paris is not cited in history until the fourth  century, when Julian the Apostate appears to have there fixed his  residence, and in his Misopogon, which he wrote during his residence at  Antioch, often alludes to it under the name of his dear Lutetia,  although complaining that the cold was such during one winter as to  compel him to have a fire in his bed-room, expressing much  dissatisfaction at the odour emitted by the burning charcoal, to the  effects of which he was nearly falling a victim. His abode was what it  is now and has been for many ages, the Palace of Thermes, of which there  are still the remains, now converted into a museum for relics of the  Ancient Gauls; the entrance is in the Rue de la Harpe. Between the  numbers 61 and 65. Julian there resided with his wife Helen, sister of  the emperor Constantius, and in his address to the senate and people of  Athens speaks of the arrival of foreign auxiliary troops at Paris, and  of their tumultuously rising and surrounding his palace; and that it was  in a chamber adjoining that of his wife wherein he meditated on the  means of appeasing them. According to various historians, this  circumstance occurred in the year 360. Soon after this period, the same  palace was inhabited by the Emperors Valentinian and Valens. It is  supposed to have been built in the year 292, the evidence of which is  tolerably well authenticated. Whatever errors might fall to the share of  Julian, it is certain he rendered great service to Gaul, and  particularly to Paris: he cleared the adjacent country entirely of a set  of ferocious barbarians, who were eternally overrunning the different  states of Gaul. But the Parisians were not long doomed to enjoy the  quiet and prosperity which had been obtained for them by the equitable  laws instituted by Julian. In 406, hordes of enemies suddenly appeared  in all parts of Gaul, swarming in from different barbarous nations, in  such numbers that they swept all before them for ten successive years,  and about 465 the Franks succeeded in permanently establishing  themselves in Gaul, and of course Paris shared the fate of the  surrounding country; by them at length the Roman government was  overthrown, and that which was substituted was far less equitable or  calculated for the happiness of the people.    The Franks were a powerful maritime people, coming from the north-west  of Germany, obtaining possession of the different towns which they met  with in their course, until they arrived at Tournai, which was  constituted their capital; and Childeric their king is reported to have  laid siege to Paris, which resisted for several years; but dying in the  year 481, he was succeeded by Clovis his son, who, at the head of a  numerous army defeated the Roman governor Seyagrius, gained possession  of his capital, and was styled the first King of Gaul. Many authors  assert that Pharamond was the first monarch who reigned over the Gallic  states,"]]]
