Segments are cut off    from its base, and these divide again into two by a wall parallel to    the first. Of the two cells thus formed one undergoes no further    division and forms the central cell of an internode (_y_); the other    divides repeatedly, forming a node or joint (_x_).      As the arrangement of these cells is essentially the same in the    leaves and stem, we will examine it in the former, as by cutting    several cross-sections of the whole bunch of young leaves near the    top of the plant, we shall pretty certainly get some sections    through a joint. The arrangement is shown in Figure 23, _E_.      As the stem grows, a covering is formed over the large internodal    cell (_y_) by the growth of cells from the nodes. These grow both    from above and below, meeting in the middle of the internode and    completely hiding the long axial cell. A section across the    internode shows the large axial cell (_y_) surrounded by the    regularly arranged cells of the covering or cortex (Fig. 23, _D_).      All the cells contain a layer of protoplasm next the wall with    numerous oval chloroplasts. If the cells are uninjured, they often    show a very marked movement of the protoplasm. These movements are    best seen, however, in forms like _Nitella_, where the long    internodal cells are not covered with a cortex. In _Chara_ they are    most evident in the root hairs that fasten the plant to the ground.      The growth of the leaves is almost identical with that of the stem,    but the apical growth is limited, and the apical cell becomes    finally very long and pointed (Fig. 23, _C_). In some species the    chloroplasts are reddish in the young cells, assuming their green    color as the cells approach maturity.    The plant multiplies non-sexually by means of special branches that  may become detached, but there are no non-sexual spores formed.      The sexual organs have already been noticed arising in pairs at the    joints of the leaves. The ooegonium is formed above, the antheridium    below.      The young ooegonium (_F_, _O_) consists of a central cell, below    which is a smaller one surrounded by a circle of five others, which    do not at first project above the central cell, but later completely    envelop it (_G_). Each of these five cells early becomes divided    into an upper and a lower one, the latter becoming twisted as it    elongates, and the central cell later has a small cell cut off from    its base by an oblique wall. The central cell forms the egg cell,    which in the ripe ooegonium (_L_, _O_) is surrounded by five,    spirally twisted cells, and crowned by a circle of five smaller    ones, which become of a yellowish color when full grown. They    separate at the time of fertilization to allow the spermatozoids to    enter the ooegonium.      The antheridium consists at first of a basal cell and a terminal    one. The latter, which is nearly globular, divides into eight nearly    similar cells by walls passing through the centre. In each of these    eight cells two walls are next formed parallel to the outer surface,    so that the antheridium (apart from the basal cell) contains    twenty-four cells arranged in three concentric series (_G_, _an._).    These cells, especially the outer ones, develop a great amount of a    red pigment, giving the antheridium its characteristic color.      The diameter of the antheridium now increases rapidly, and the    central cells separate, leaving a large space within. Of the inner    cells, the second series, while not increasing in diameter,    elongate, assuming an oblong form, and from the innermost are    developed long filaments (_I_, _J_) composed of a single row of    cells, in each of which is formed a spermatozoid.      The eight outer cells are nearly triangular in outline, fitting    together by deeply indented margins, and having the oblong cells    with the attached filaments upon their inner faces.      If a ripe antheridium is crushed in a drop of water, after lying a    few minutes the spermatozoids will escape through small openings in    the side of the cells. They are much larger than any we have met    with. Each is a colorless, spiral thread with about three coils, one    end being somewhat dilated with a few granules; the other more    pointed, and bearing two extremely long and delicate cilia (_K_). To    see the cilia it is necessary to kill the spermatozoids with iodine    or some other reagent.      After fertilization the outer cells of the ooegonium become very    hard, and the whole falls off, germinating after a sufficient period    of rest.    According to the accounts of Pringsheim and others, the young plant  consists at first of a row of elongated cells, upon which a bud is  formed that develops into the perfect plant.    There are two families of the _Characeae_, the _Chareae_, of which  _Chara_ is the type, and the _Nitelleae_, represented by various  species of _Nitella_ and _Tolypella_. The second family have the  internodes without any cortex--that is, consisting of a single long  cell; and the crown at the top of the ooegonium is composed of ten  cells instead of five. They are also destitute of the limy coating of  the _Chareae_.    Both as regards the structure of the plant itself, as well as the  reproductive organs, especially the very complex antheridium, the  _Characeae_ are very widely separated from any other group of plants,  either above or below them.          CHAPTER VI.    THE BROWN ALGAE (_Phaeophyceae_).      [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Forms of diatoms. _A_, _Pinnularia_. i, seen  from above; ii, from the side. _B_, _Fragillaria_ (?). _C_,  _Navicula_. _D_, _F_, _Eunotia_. _E_, _Gomphonema_. _G_, _Cocconeis_.  _H_, _Diatoma_. All x 300.]    These plants are all characterized by the presence of a brown pigment,  in addition to the chlorophyll, which almost entirely conceals the  latter, giving the plants a brownish color, ranging from a light  yellowish brown to nearly black. One order of plants that possibly  belongs here (_Diatomaceae_) are single celled, but the others are for  the most part large seaweeds. The diatoms, which are placed in this  class simply on account of the color, are probably not closely related  to the other brown algae, but just where they should be placed is  difficult to say. In some respects they approach quite closely the  desmids, and are not infrequently regarded as related to them. They  are among the commonest of organisms occurring everywhere in stagnant  and running water, both fresh and salt, forming usually, slimy,  yellowish coatings on stones, mud, aquatic plants, etc. Like the  desmids they may be single or united into filaments, and not  infrequently are attached by means of a delicate gelatinous stalk  (Fig. 25).    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Diatoms attached by a gelatinous stalk.  x 150]      They are at once distinguished from the desmids by their color,    which is always some shade of yellowish or reddish brown. The    commonest forms, _e.g._ _Navicula_ (Fig. 24, _C_), are boat-shaped    when seen from above, but there is great variety in this respect.    The cell wall is always impregnated with large amounts of flint, so    that after the cell dies its shape is perfectly preserved, the flint    making a perfect cast of it, looking like glass. These flinty shells    exhibit wonderfully beautiful and delicate markings which are    sometimes so fine as to test the best lenses to make them out.      This shell is composed of two parts, one shutting over the other    like a pill box and its cover. This arrangement is best seen in such    large forms as _Pinnularia_ (Fig. 24, _A_ ii).    Most of the diatoms show movements, swimming slowly or gliding over  solid substances; but like the movements of _Oscillaria_ and the  desmids, the movements are not satisfactorily understood, although  several explanations have been offered.    They resemble somewhat the desmids in their reproduction.      THE TRUE BROWN ALGAE.    These are all marine forms, many of great size, reaching a length in  some cases of a hundred metres or more, and showing a good deal of  differentiation in their tissues and organs.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--_A_, a branch of common rock weed (_Fucus_),  one-half natural size. _x_, end of a branch bearing conceptacles. _B_,  section through a conceptacle containing ooegonia (_og._), x 25. _C_,  _E_, successive stages in the development of the ooegonium, x 150. _F_,  _G_, antheridia. In _G_, one of the antheridia has discharged the mass  of spermatozoids (_an._), x 150.]    One of the commonest forms is the ordinary rock weed (_Fucus_), which  covers the rocks of our northeastern coast with a heavy drapery for  several feet above low-water mark, so that the plants are completely  exposed as the tide recedes. The commonest species, _F. vesiculosus_  (Fig. 26, _A_), is distinguished by the air sacs with which the stems  are provided. The plant is attached to the rock by means of a sort of  disc or root from which springs a stem of tough, leathery texture, and  forking regularly at intervals, so that the ultimate branches are very  numerous, and the plant may reach a length of a metre or more. The  branches are flattened and leaf-like, the centre traversed by a  thickened midrib. The end of the growing branches is occupied by a  transversely elongated pit or depression. The growing point is at the  bottom of this pit, and by a regular forking of the growing point the  symmetrical branching of the plant is brought about. Scattered over  the surface are little circular pits through whose openings protrude  bunches of fine hairs. When wet the plant is flexible and leathery,  but it may become quite dry and hard without suffering, as may be seen  when the plants are exposed to the sun at low tide.

Baron Bülow felt the greatest satisfaction at the  statements made by your Lordship, and determined to write again to  M. Le Coq directing him to act in accordance with them. He hopes  that by conduct and language so energetic as that adopted by your  Lordship an impression may be made upon the Turkish Government, and  an end be put to the barbarous cruelties of which it has of late  been guilty.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) WESTMORLAND.              No. 22.      _Sir Robert Gordon to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received February_  24.)    (Extract.)                        _Vienna, February_ 16, 1844.    In compliance with your Lordship's instructions, I have communicated  to Prince Metternich, for the information of the Austrian  Government, your despatch to Sir Stratford Canning relating to the  execution of the Greek renegade by the Turkish authorities at Brussa  on the ground of his apostacy from Islamism.    Whilst I stated to his Highness that my Government did not think it  necessary formally to solicit the co-operation of the Internuncio in  a matter which could only be viewed by every Government in Europe  with the greatest abhorrence, I have been anxious to ascertain in  how far the instructions which are forwarded from hence would be  made to coincide with your Lordship's; and I have now to state that,  although agreeing in the principle upon which have been founded the  remonstrances of Her Majesty's Government, and seeking to arrive at  the same result, the Austrian Minister has nevertheless a decided  objection to the wording of your Lordship's instructions, and the  peremptory terms in which it is endeavoured by them to enforce the  Sultan's compliance.              No. 23.      _Lord Stuart de Rothsay to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  February_ 24.)    (Extract.)                   _St. Petersburgh, February_ 6, 1844.    In obedience to the orders contained in your Lordship's despatch of  the 16th January, I have communicated to Count Nesselrode a copy of  your instructions to Sir Stratford Canning upon the subject of a  Greek who had been executed near Brussa as an apostate from  Islamism.    I did so without alluding to the wish of Her Majesty's Government  that the Russian Minister at Constantinople might be furnished with  instructions on the subject. The Vice-Chancellor, nevertheless, said  that he should consider attentively the communication I had made,  and see how far it might be useful to adopt a similar course,  adding, that although he quite participated in the feelings which  actuated Her Majesty's Government, he thought that other means might  be tried which would be more efficacious in attaining our common  object. He afterwards remarked that through the instrumentality of  some of the Russian Consular Agents Pashas had not unfrequently been  persuaded, in an unofficial manner, to facilitate the removal from  their Government of Greeks and others who had rendered themselves  liable to capital punishment for apostacy; and he gave me to  understand that he was of opinion that greater security to  Christians would be obtained by the exercise of the individual  influence of foreign agents, than by seeking an alteration in the  fundamental laws of the Turkish Empire, such as appeared to be the  object of Her Majesty's Government.    Count Nesselrode appears disposed to instruct M. Titow to give his  general support to Her Majesty's Ambassador.              No. 24.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received March_  8.)    (Extract.)                   _Constantinople, February_ 10, 1844.    On the 5th instant I received your Lordship's instructions of the  16th ultimo, relating to the execution of a Greek near Brussa for  relapsing from Islamism, and directing me to require of the Porte an  unequivocal renunciation of the principle involved in that barbarous  act. I received at the same time, from Her Majesty's Ambassador at  Paris a despatch informing me that he had communicated those  instructions to M. Guizot, and was authorized by him to express that  Minister's approbation of their contents, and his intention of  ordering M. de Bourqueney to concur with me for the attainment of  the object to which they were directed.    I proceeded at once to execute the commands of Her Majesty's  Government. To the French Minister I read your Lordship's first  instruction, and also Lord Cowley's despatch. He returned my  confidence by putting me in possession of M. Guizot's instructions  to him of the 13th ultimo, and by expressing his readiness to act in  concert with me for the accomplishment of our common purpose. To  Rifaat Pasha I communicated a copy, together with an exact  translation, of your Lordship's first instruction. I waited upon his  Excellency by appointment for this object on the 9th instant, having  apprized the Russian, Austrian, and Prussian Ministers of my  intention the day before.    The Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs read, in my presence, the  whole of your Lordship's instruction translated into Turkish. Having  finished it, he rose from his seat rather abruptly, without saying a  word, and left the room for a few minutes. On his return, he told me  that the subject was too important for him to give me an answer  without referring to the Council; but, if I were inclined to listen,  he would at once impart to me such observations as occurred to his  mind. I assured him that I was willing to receive with becoming  consideration whatever he thought proper to state; and he then  proceeded to draw a strong line of distinction between custom and  divine law, intimating that a practice derived from the former  source might be abandoned to meet the wishes of Europe, or even of  Great Britain alone, but that a law, prescribed by God himself, was  not to be set aside by any human power; and that the Sultan in  attempting it might be exposed to a heavy, perhaps even to a  dangerous, responsibility. He sought to learn from me whether your  Lordship had been fully aware of this view of the case in writing  the instruction communicated to him; and it seemed to be his object  both to prepare me for an unsatisfactory answer, and to obtain from  me some admission which might give him an advantage in shaping the  decision of the Council.    I had already, in presenting the instruction, endeavoured to make it  clearly understood, that Her Majesty's Government had no object in  view but the one so distinctly and powerfully stated therein; and  also to show how imperiously the welfare of the Porte itself  requires that a practice and principle which operate as moral  barriers between Turkey and Christendom, should now be once for all  renounced and utterly abandoned. I had every reason to believe that  your Lordship had instructed me with a full knowledge of the  question in all its bearings and eventual consequences; that the  course deliberately adopted by Her Majesty's Government, and  announced to the principal Courts of Europe previously united in  reprobation of the late impolitic and atrocious executions, was not  to be receded from; and that any opening to a compromise on so vital  a point could only encourage resistance and endanger the most  important interests. I, therefore, rested entirely on the terms of  your Lordship's instruction, to which, in truth, there was nothing  for me to add.    Although I replied to some of Rifaat Pasha's remarks in a  considerate and conciliatory manner, I referred him steadily to your  Lordship's instructions, and left no reason to hope that any evasive  or temporizing assurance would be accepted as satisfactory by Her  Majesty's Government.                No. 25.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received March_  8.)    My Lord,                     _Constantinople, February_ 12, 1844.    The interview which I had on the 9th instant with Rifaat Pasha was  followed yesterday by one of a similar character between that  Minister and the French Representative. M. de Bourqueney obligingly  called upon me as soon as he returned from the Pasha's house; and  his report of the conference presented in substance a counterpart of  what had before passed between his Excellency and myself. He stated  that he had given in a paper composed of the strongest passages from  M. Guizot's instruction to him of the 13th ultimo; that he had found  in Rifaat Pasha's remarks the same indication of resistance on the  ground of religion which I had experienced; that in reprobating the  executions complained of, and urging the abandonment of so barbarous  a law for the future, he had placed himself as nearly as possible on  the same ground with me, and that he had carefully avoided any  premature discussion of the form of declaration by which the Porte  would probably, in the end, attempt to satisfy the remonstrating  Governments without a surrender of the principle, or more than a  virtual suspension of the practice.    Notwithstanding the want of any instruction from M. Guizot,  subsequent to Lord Cowley's communication to that Minister, Baron de  Bourqueney found himself sufficiently authorized by the instruction  of the 13th to give me his cordial and unqualified support.    Agreeably to M. Guizot's suggestion, as conveyed to me in Lord  Cowley's despatch, we have acted separately in form, though  concurrently in substance.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.              No. 26.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Stratford Canning_.    Sir,                              _Foreign Office, March_ 19, 1844.
