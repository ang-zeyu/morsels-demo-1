He who visits Pendle[31] will yet find that charms  are generally resorted to amongst the lower classes; that there are  hares which, in their persuasion, never can be caught, and which  survive only to baffle and confound the huntsman; that each small  hamlet has its peculiar and gifted personage, whom it is dangerous to  offend; that the wise man and wise woman (the white witches of our  ancestors) still continue their investigations of truth, undisturbed  by the rural police or the progress of the schoolmaster; that each  locality has its haunted house; that apparitions still walk their  ghostly rounds--and little would his reputation for piety avail that  clergyman in the eyes of his parishioners who should refuse to lay  those \"extravagant and erring spirits,\" when requested, by those due  liturgic ceremonies which the orthodoxy of tradition requires.    [Footnote 31: It was my good fortune to visit this wizard-haunted spot  within the last few weeks, in company with the able and zealous  Archdeacon[A] within whose ecclesiastical cure it is comprized, and to  whose singularly accurate knowledge of this district, and courteous  communication of much valuable information regarding it, I hold myself  greatly indebted. Following, with unequal steps, such a guide,  accompanied, likewise, by an excellent Canon of the Church[B] with all  the \"armamentaria coeli\" at command against the powers of darkness,  and a lay auxiliary[C], whose friendly converse would make the  roughest journey appear smooth, I need scarcely say, I passed through                              \"The forest wyde,      Whose hideous horror and sad trembling sownd      Full griesly seem'd,\"    unscathed by the old lords of the soil, and needed not Mengus's Fuga,  Fustis et Flagellum Daemonum, as a triple coat of mail.]    [Footnote A: The Venerable the Archdeacon of Manchester, the Rev. John  Rushton, who is also the Incumbent of New Church, in Pendle.]    [Footnote B: The Rev. Canon Parkinson.]    [Footnote C: J.B. Wanklyn, Esq.]    In the early part of the reign of James the first, and at the period  when his execrable statute against witchcraft might have been  sharpening its appetite by a temporary fast for the full meal of blood  by which it was eventually glutted,--for as yet it could count no  recorded victims,--two wretched old women with their families resided  in the Forest of Pendle. Their names were Elizabeth Southernes and Ann  Whittle, better known, perhaps, in the chronicles of witchcraft, by  the appellations of Old Demdike and Old Chattox.[32] Both had  attained, or had reached the verge of the advanced age of eighty, were  evidently in a state of extreme poverty, subsisting with their  families by occasional employment, by mendicancy, but principally,  perhaps, by the assumption of that unlawful power, which commerce with  spirits of evil was supposed to procure, and of which their sex, life,  appearance, and peculiarities, might seem to the prejudiced  neighbourhood in the Forest to render them not unsuitable  depositaries. In both, perhaps, some vindictive wish, which appeared  to have been gratified nearly as soon as uttered, or some one of those  curious coincidences which no individual's life is without, led to an  impression which time, habit, and general recognition would gradually  deepen into full conviction, that each really possessed the powers  which witchcraft was believed to confer. Whether it be with witches as  it is said to be with a much maligned branch of a certain profession,  that it needs two of its members in a district to make its exercise  profitable, it is not for me to say; but it is seldom found that  competition is accompanied by any very amicable feeling in the  competitors, or by a disposition to underrate the value of the  merchandize which each has to offer for sale. Accordingly, great was  the rivalry, constant the feuds, and unintermitting the respective  criminations of the Erictho and Canidia of Pendle,[33] who had opened  shops for the vending of similar contraband commodities, and were  called upon to decry each other's stock, as well as to magnify their  own. Each \"gave her little senate laws,\" and had her own party (or  tail, according to modern phraseology) in the Forest. Some looked up  to and patronized one, and some the other. If old Demdike could boast  that she had Tibb as a familiar, old Chattox was not without her  Fancy. If the former had skill in waxen images, the latter could dig  up the scalps of the dead, and make their teeth serviceable to her  unhallowed purposes. In the anxiety which each felt to outvie the  other, and to secure the greater share of the general custom of a not  very extended or very lucrative market, each would wish to be  represented as more death-dealing, destructive, and powerful than her  neighbour; and she who could number up the most goodly assortment of  damage done to man and beast, whether real or not was quite  immaterial, as long as the draught was spiced and flavoured to suit  the general taste, stood the best chance of obtaining a monopoly. It  is a curious fact, that the son-in-law of one of these two  individuals, and whose wife was herself executed as a witch, paid to  the other a yearly rent,[34] on an express covenant that she should  exempt him from her charms and witchcrafts. Where the possession of a  commission from the powers of darkness was thus eagerly and  ostentatiously paraded, every death, the cause of which was not  perfectly obvious, whether it ended in a sudden termination or a slow  and gradual decline, would be placed to the general account of one of  the two (to use Master Potts's description,) \"agents for the devil in  those parts,\" as the party responsible for these unclaimed dividends  of mortality. Did a cow go mad, or was a horse unaccountably afflicted  with the staggers, the same solution was always at hand to clear  negligence and save the trouble of inquiry; and so far from modestly  disclaiming these atrocities, the only struggle on the parts of  Mothers Demdike and Chattox would be which should first appropriate  them. And in all this it must not be forgotten that their own  credulity was at least as great as the credulity of their neighbours,  and that each had the power in question was so much an admitted point,  that she had long ceased, in all probability, to entertain any doubts  on the subject. With this general conviction on one hand, and a  sincere persuasion on the other, it would be surprising if, in the  course of a few years, the scandalous chronicle of Pendle had not  accumulated a _corpus delicti_ against them, which only required that  \"_one of his Majesties Justices in these parts, a very religious  honest gentleman, painful in the service of his country_,\" should work  the materials into shape, and make \"the gruel thick and slab.\"    [Footnote 32: The Archdeacon of Manchester suggests that this is  merely a corruption of Chadwick or Chadwicks, and not, as explained in  the Note, p. 19, from her chattering as she went along.]    [Footnote 33: These bickerings were no doubt exasperated by the  robbery committed upon old Demdike and Alizon Device, which is  detailed in the examinations, some of the _opima spolia_ abstracted on  which occasion she detected on the person of old Chattox's daughter.]    [Footnote 34: Of an aghendole of meal. Since writing the Note, p. 23,  I am indebted to Miss Clegg, of Hallfoot, near Clitheroe, for  information as to the exact quantity contained in an aghendole, which  is eight pounds. This measure, she informs me, is still in use in  Little Harwood, in the district of Pendle. The Archdeacon of  Manchester considers that an aghendole, or more properly, as generally  pronounced, a nackendole, is a kneading-dole, the quantity of meal,  &c. usually taken for kneading at one time. There can be no doubt that  this is the correct derivation.]    Such a man was soon found in the representative of the old family of  the Nowels of Read, who, desirous of signalizing himself as an active  and stirring justice, took up the case of these self-accusing  culprits, for both made confessions when examined before him, with a  vigour worthy of a better cause. On the 2nd April, 1612, he committed  old Demdike, old Chattox, Alizon Device, and Anne Redfern to  Lancaster, to take their trial at the next assizes for various murders  and witchcrafts. \"Here,\" says the faithful chronicler, Master Potts,  \"they had not stayed a weeke, when their children and friendes being  abroad at libertie, laboured a speciall meeting at Malking Tower[35]  in the Forrest of Pendle, vpon Good-fryday, within a weeke after they  were committed, of all the most dangerous, wicked, and damnable  witches in the county farre and neere. Vpon Good-fryday they met,  according to solemne appoyntment, solemnized this great festiuall day  according to their former order, with great cheare, merry company, and  much conference. In the end, in this great assemblie it was decreed  that M. Covell, [he was the gaoler of Lancaster Castle,] by reason of  his Office, shall be slaine before the next Assises, the Castle at  Lancaster to be blown up,\" &c., &c. This witches' convention, so  historically famous, we unquestionably owe to the \"painful justice\"  whose scent after witches and plots entitled him to a promotion which  he did not obtain. An overt act so alarming and so indisputable, at  once threw the country, far and near, into the greatest  ferment--_furiis surrexit Etruria justis_--while it supplied an  admirable _locus in quo_ for tracing those whose retiring habits had  prevented their"]]]
