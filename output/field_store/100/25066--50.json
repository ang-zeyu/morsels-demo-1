Nevertheless, the two sides are negotiating the details for holding    the second round of presidential elections.

Oil production is    vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal    fighting continues to severely affect the economy, and food must be    imported. In 1993, production fell by an estimated 22.6%, mainly    because of the capture by insurgents of the oil town of Soyo and    diamond-producing areas in northeastern Angola. Angola has rich    natural resources - notably gold, diamonds, and arable land, in    addition to large oil depoaits - but will need to end the war and    reform government policies if it is to achieve its potential.

According to Foerstemann its day is Cauac.           *       *       *       *       *    Finally the _owl_ and the _ape_ (or monkey) must be mentioned as animals  of mythologic significance, of which we have already spoken in connection  with gods A and C. The _scorpion_ also seems to have an important  mythologic significance, and appears in the manuscripts in connection  with figures of gods, as, for example, in Cort. 7a and Tro. 31*a,  33*a, 34*a (god M with a scorpion's tail). In addition to those  discussed in this paper, there are a few animals in the manuscripts,  which probably also have a partial mythologic significance, but which  have been omitted because they are represented in a naturalistic manner,  thus, for example, the deer on Tro. 8, et seq., while idealization (with  human bodies, with torches, hieroglyphic character on the head, etc.)  should be considered as an unmistakable sign of mythologic meaning.    A mythologic significance also seems to belong to the _bee_ which plays so  prominent a part of the Codex Troano. Probably the section in question of  the Madrid manuscript (1* et seq.) treats of bee-keeping, but incidentally  it certainly has to do also with the mythologic conceptions connected with  the culture of bees.    The _bat_ which is found as a mythological figure on pottery vessels and  inscriptions from the Maya region (compare Seler, Zeitschrift fuer  Ethnologie, 1894, p. 577) does not occur in the manuscripts. It is true,  however, that hieroglyphic signs, which seem to relate to the head of the  bat, occur in isolated cases in the manuscripts.          SUMMARY.      An enumeration of the most important deities in the manuscripts gives the  following results, in connection with which it is to be noted that, of  course, the numbers cannot be absolutely correct, because one or another  of the pictures occasionally remains doubtful. As far as possible,  however, only the _positively_ determined representations have been  considered.    The deity occurring most frequently in the DRESDEN MANUSCRIPT is god B,  who is pictured there 141 times. Following him in point of number in the  same manuscript are the death-god A pictured 33 times, god D 19 times,  and gods C and E 17 and 14 times respectively.    In the MADRID MANUSCRIPT, god D, with 84 pictures, is of most frequent  occurrence. He is followed by the maize-god E with 76 pictures, god B  with 71, god A with 53, C with 38 and M with 37 pictures.    In the PARIS MANUSCRIPT, god E's picture can be verified 8 times, those  of C and B 6 times each and that of god A twice; N and K are also  frequently represented.    An enumeration of all the pictures in all the manuscripts shows that the  following deities occur most frequently and are therefore to be  considered the most important:      1.  God B: pictured 218 times.    2.   \"  D:  \"       103  \"    3.   \"  E:  \"        98  \"    4.   \"  A:  \"        88  \"    5.   \"  C:  \"        61  \"    6.   \"  M:  \"        40  \"    7.   \"  F:  \"        33  \"    Furthermore, interesting conclusions can be arrived at, by means of a  list of those deities, who occur in the representations of the  manuscripts, so _united_ or _grouped together_ as to make it evident that  they must stand in some relation to one another. _Mythologic  combinations_ of this kind occur among the following deities and  mythological animals:    1. In the DRESDEN MANUSCRIPT: D and C, B and C, dog and vulture, bird and  serpent, B and K.    2. In the MADRID MANUSCRIPT: F and M, B and M, C and M, E and M, A and E,  A and D, A and F, B and C, D and C, D and E.    3. In the PARIS MANUSCRIPT: N and K, B and K.    The most common of these combinations are those of the deities A and F, M  and F, A and E, D and C. These groups are entirely intelligible,  consisting of death-god and war-god, god of the travelling merchants and  war-god, death-god and maize-god (as adversaries: meaning famine),  night-god and deity of the polar star.
