He married Thorhild Ptarmigan, daughter of Thord the  Yeller. Their son was Thord Horse-head. Thorfinn Karlsefni[30-1] was the  name of Thord's son. Thorfinn's mother's name was Thorunn. Thorfinn was  engaged in trading voyages, and was reputed to be a successful merchant.  One summer Karlsefni equipped his ship, with the intention of sailing to  Greenland. Snorri, Thorbrand's son, of Alptafirth accompanied him, and  there were forty men on board the ship with them. There was a man named  Biarni, Grimolf's son, a man from Breidafirth, and another named  Thorhall, Gamli's son, an East-firth man. They equipped their ship, the  same summer as Karlsefni, with the intention of making a voyage to  Greenland; they had also forty men in their ship. When they were ready to  sail, the two ships put to sea together. It has not been recorded how  long a voyage they had; but it is to be told, that both of the ships  arrived at Ericsfirth in the autumn. Eric and other of the inhabitants of  the country rode to the ships, and a goodly trade was soon established  between them. Gudrid was requested by the skippers to take such of their  wares as she wished, while Eric, on his part, showed great munificence in  return, in that he extended an invitation to both crews to accompany him  home for winter quarters at Brattahlid. The merchants accepted this  invitation, and went with Eric. Their wares were then conveyed to  Brattahlid; nor was there lack there of good and commodious store-houses,  in which to keep them; nor was there wanting much of that, which they  needed, and the merchants were well pleased with their entertainment at  Eric's home during that winter. Now as it drew toward Yule, Eric became  very taciturn, and less cheerful than had been his wont. On one occasion  Karlsefni entered into conversation with Eric, and said: \"Hast thou aught  weighing upon thee, Eric? The folk have remarked, that thou art somewhat  more silent than thou hast been hitherto. Thou hast entertained us with  great liberality, and it behooves us to make such return as may lie  within our power. Do thou now but make known the cause of thy  melancholy.\" Eric answers: \"Ye accept hospitality gracefully, and in  manly wise, and I am not pleased that ye should be the sufferers by  reason of our intercourse; rather am I troubled at the thought, that it  should be given out elsewhere, that ye have never passed a worse Yule  than this, now drawing nigh, when Eric the Red was your host at  Brattahlid in Greenland.\" \"There shall be no cause for that,\" replies  Karlsefni, \"we have malt, and meal, and corn in our ships, and you are  welcome to take of these whatsoever you wish, and to provide as liberal  an entertainment as seems fitting to you.\" Eric accepts this offer, and  preparations were made for the Yule feast, and it was so sumptuous, that  it seemed to the people they had scarcely ever seen so grand an  entertainment before. And after Yule, Karlsefni broached the subject of a  marriage with Gudrid to Eric, for he assumed that with him rested the  right to bestow her hand in marriage. Eric answers favorably, and says,  that she would accomplish the fate in store for her, adding that he had  heard only good reports of him. And, not to prolong this, the result was,  that Thorfinn was betrothed to Thurid,[31-1] and the banquet was  augmented, and their wedding was celebrated; and this befell at  Brattahlid during the winter.    _Beginning of the Wineland Voyages._--About this time there began to be  much talk at Brattahlid, to the effect that Wineland the Good should be  explored, for, it was said, that country must be possessed of many goodly  qualities. And so it came to pass, that Karlsefni and Snorri fitted out  their ship, for the purpose of going in search of that country in the  spring. Biarni and Thorhall joined the expedition with their ship, and  the men who had borne them company. There was a man named Thorvard; he  was wedded to Freydis, a natural daughter of Eric the Red. He also  accompanied them, together with Thorvald, Eric's son, and Thorhall, who  was called the Huntsman. He had been for a long time with Eric as his  hunter and fisherman during the summer, and as his steward during the  winter. Thorhall was stout and swarthy, and of giant stature; he was a  man of few words, though given to abusive language, when he did speak,  and he ever incited Eric to evil. He was a poor Christian; he had a wide  knowledge of the unsettled regions. He was on the same ship with Thorvard  and Thorvald. They had that ship which Thorbiorn had brought out. They  had in all one hundred and sixty men, when they sailed to the Western  Settlement,[32-1] and thence to Bear Island. Thence they bore away to the  southward two \"doegr.\"[32-2] Then they saw land, and launched a boat,  and explored the land, and found there large flat stones [_hellur_], and  many of these were twelve ells wide; there were many Arctic foxes there.  They gave a name to the country, and called it Helluland [the land of  flat stones]. Then they sailed with northerly winds two \"doegr,\" and  land then lay before them, and upon it was a great wood and many wild  beasts; an island lay off the land to the south-east, and there they  found a bear, and they called this Biarney [Bear Island], while the land  where the wood was they called Markland [Forest-land]. Thence they  sailed southward along the land for a long time, and came to a cape; the  land lay upon the starboard; there were long strands and sandy banks  there. They rowed to the land and found upon the cape there the keel of  a ship, and they called it there Kialarnes [Keelness]; they also called  the strands Furdustrandir [Wonder-strands], because they were so long to  sail by.[33-1] Then the country became indented with bays, and they  steered their ships into a bay. It was when Leif was with King Olaf  Tryggvason, and he bade him proclaim Christianity to Greenland, that the  king gave him two Gaels; the man's name was Haki, and the woman's  Haekia. The king advised Leif to have recourse to these people, if he  should stand in need of fleetness, for they were swifter than deer. Eric  and Leif had tendered Karlsefni the services of this couple. Now when  they had sailed past Wonder-strands, they put the Gaels ashore, and  directed them to run to the southward, and investigate the nature of the  country, and return again before the end of the third half-day. They  were each clad in a garment, which they called \"kiafal,\"[33-2] which was  so fashioned, that it had a hood at the top, was open at the sides, was  sleeveless, and was fastened between the legs with buttons and loops,  while elsewhere they were naked. Karlsefni and his companions cast  anchor, and lay there during their absence; and when they came again,  one of them carried a bunch of grapes, and the other an ear of new-sown  wheat. They went on board the ship, whereupon Karlsefni and his  followers held on their way, until they came to where the coast was  indented with bays. They stood into a bay with their ships. There was an  island out at the mouth of the bay, about which there were strong  currents, wherefore they called it Straumey [Stream Isle]. There were so  many birds[33-3] there, that it was scarcely possible to step between  the eggs. They sailed through the firth, and called it Straumfiord  [Streamfirth], and carried their cargoes ashore from the ships, and  established themselves there. They had brought with them all kinds of  live-stock. It was a fine country there. There were mountains  thereabouts. They occupied themselves exclusively with the exploration  of the country. They remained there during the winter, and they had  taken no thought for this during the summer. The fishing began to fail,  and they began to fall short of food. Then Thorhall the Huntsman  disappeared. They had already prayed to God for food, but it did not  come as promptly as their necessities seemed to demand. They searched  for Thorhall for three half-days, and found him on a projecting crag. He  was lying there, and looking up at the sky, with mouth and nostrils  agape, and mumbling something. They asked him why he had gone thither;  he replied, that this did not concern any one. They asked him then to go  home with them, and he did so. Soon after this a whale appeared there,  and they captured it, and flensed it, and no one could tell what manner  of whale it was; and when the cooks had prepared it, they ate of it, and  were all made ill by it. Then Thorhall, approaching them, says: \"Did not  the Red-beard[34-1] prove more helpful than your Christ? This is my  reward for the verses which I composed to Thor, the Trustworthy; seldom  has he failed me.\" When the people heard this, they cast the whale down  into the sea, and made their appeals to God. The weather then improved,  and they could now row out to fish, and thenceforward they had no lack  of provisions, for they could hunt game on the land, gather eggs on the  island, and catch fish from the sea.    _Concerning Karlsefni and Thorhall._--It is said, that Thorhall wished to  sail to the northward beyond Wonder-strands, in search of Wineland, while  Karlsefni desired to proceed to the southward, off the coast. Thorhall  prepared for his voyage out below the island, having only nine men in his  party, for all of the remainder of the company went with Karlsefni. And  one day when Thorhall was carrying water aboard his ship, and was  drinking, he recited this ditty:[35-1]        When I came, these brave men told me,        Here the best of drink I'd get,      Now with water-pail behold me,--        Wine and I are strangers yet.      Stooping at the spring, I've tested        All the wine this land affords;      Of its vaunted charms divested,        Poor indeed are its rewards.    And when they were ready, they hoisted sail; whereupon Thorhall recited"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#9)"],[1,"   \"She thinks, uncle, that by doing so she can bend you to her wishes.  She hasn't the slightest idea of any permanent separation. She is  merely experimenting upon your weakness. She expects you will recall  her in a week, at the latest. That is all of it.\"    Like most weak men, it made Mr. Linden angry to have his strength  doubted.    \"You think that?\" he said.    \"I have no doubt of it.\"    \"She shall find that I am resolute,\" he said, irritably. \"I will not  recall her.\"    \"Bravo, uncle! Only stick to that, and she will yield unconditionally  within a fortnight. A little patience, and you will carry your point.  Then all will be smooth sailing.\"    \"I hope so, Curtis. Your words have cheered me. I will be patient. But  I hope I shan't have to wait long. Where is the morning paper?\"    \"I shall have to humor and deceive him,\" thought Curtis. \"I shall have  a difficult part to play, but I am sure to succeed at last.\"          Chapter XI.  Florence Secures Employment.      For a few days after being installed in her new home Florence was like  one dazed.    She could not settle her mind to any plan of self-support.    She was too unhappy in her enforced exile from her home, and it  saddened her to think that the uncle who had always been so kind was  permanently estranged from her.    Though Mrs. O'Keefe was kind, and Dodger was her faithful friend, she  could not accustom herself to her poor surroundings.    She had not supposed luxury so essential to her happiness.    It was worse for her because she had nothing to do but give way to her  morbid fancies.    This Mrs. O'Keefe was clear-sighted enough to see.    \"I am sorry to see you so downcast like, my dear young lady,\" she  said.    \"How can I help it, Mrs. O'Keefe?\" returned Florence.    \"Try not to think of your wicked cousin, my dear.\"    \"It isn't of him that I think--it is of my uncle. How could he be so  cruel, and turn against me after years of kindness?\"    \"It's that wicked Curtis that is settin' him against you, take my word  for it, Miss Florence. Shure, he must be wake-minded to let such a  spalpeen set him against a swate young leddy like you.\"    \"He is weak in body, not in mind, Mrs. O'Keefe. You are right in  thinking that it is Curtis that is the cause of my misfortune.\"    \"Your uncle will come to his right mind some day, never fear! And now,  my dear, shall I give you a bit of advice?\"    \"Go on, my kind friend. I will promise to consider whatever you say.\"    \"Then you'd better get some kind of work to take up your mind--a bit  of sewin', or writin', or anything that comes to hand. I suppose you  wouldn't want to mind my apple-stand a couple of hours every day?\"    \"No,\" answered Florence. \"I don't feel equal to that.\"    \"It would do you no end of good to be out in the open air. It would  bring back the roses to your pale cheeks. If you coop yourself up in  this dark room, you'll fade away and get thin.\"    \"You are right. I will make an effort and go out. Besides, I must see  about work.\"    Here Dodger entered the room in his usual breezy way. In his hand he  brandished a morning paper.    \"How are you feelin', Florence?\" he asked; he had given up saying Miss  Florence at her request. \"Here's an advertisement that'll maybe suit  you.\"    \"Show it to me, Dodger,\" said Florence, beginning to show some  interest.    The boy directed her attention to the following advertisement:        \"Wanted.--A governess for a girl of twelve. Must be a good      performer on the piano, and able to instruct in French and      the usual English branches. Terms must be moderate. Apply to      Mrs. Leighton, at 127 W. ---- Street.\"    \"There, Florence, what do you say to that? That's better than sewin'.\"    \"I don't know, Dodger, whether I am competent.\"    \"You play on the pianner, don't you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well enough to teach?\"    \"I think so; but I may not have the gift of teaching.\"    \"Yes, you have. Haven't you been teachin' me every evenin'? You make  everything just as clear as mud--no, I don't mean that. You just  explain so that I can't help understandin'.\"    \"Then,\" said Florence, \"I suppose I am at liberty to refer to you.\"    \"Yes; you can tell the lady to call at the office of Dodger, Esq., any  mornin' after sunrise, and he'll give her full particulars.\"    Florence did not immediately decide to apply for the situation, but  the more she thought of it the more she felt inclined to do so. The  little experience she had had with Dodger satisfied her that she  should enjoy teaching better than sewing or writing.    Accordingly, an hour later, she put on her street dress and went  uptown to the address given in the advertisement.    No. 127 was a handsome brown-stone house, not unlike the one in which  Florence had been accustomed to live. It was a refreshing contrast to  the poor tenement in which she lived at present.    \"Is Mrs. Leighton at home?\" inquired Florence. \"Yes, miss,\" answered  the servant, respectfully. \"Whom shall I say?\"    \"I have come to apply for the situation of governess,\" answered  Florence, feeling rather awkward as she made the statement.    \"Ah,\" said the servant, with a perceptible decline in respect. \"Won't  you step in?\"    \"Thank you.\"    \"Well, she do dress fine for a governess,\" said Nancy to herself.  \"It's likely she'll put on airs.\"    The fact was that Florence was dressed according to her past social  position--in a costly street attire--but it had never occurred to her  that she was too well dressed for a governess.    She took her seat in the drawing-room, and five minutes later there  was a rustling heard, and Mrs. Leighton walked into the room.    \"Are you the applicant for the position of governess?\" she asked,  surveying the elegantly attired young lady seated on the sofa.    \"Yes, Mrs. Leighton,\" answered Florence, easily, for she felt more at  home in a house like this than in the tenement.    \"Have you taught before?\"    \"Very little,\" answered Florence, smiling to herself, as she wondered  what Mrs. Leighton would say if she could see Dodger, the only pupil  she ever had. \"However, I like teaching, and I like children.\"    \"Pardon me, but you don't look like a governess, Miss----\"    \"Linden,\" suggested Florence, filling out the sentence. \"Do  governesses have a peculiar look?\"    \"I mean as to dress. You are more expensively dressed than the average  governess can afford.\"    \"It is only lately that my circumstances required me to support  myself. I should not be able to buy such a dress out of my present  earnings.\"    \"I am glad to hear you say that, for I do not propose to give a large  salary.\"    \"I do not expect one,\" said Florence, quietly. \"You consider yourself  competent to instruct in music, French and the English branches?\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"Do you speak French?\"    \"Yes, madam.\"    \"Would you favor me with a specimen of your piano playing?\"    There was a piano in the back parlor. Florence removed her gloves, and  taking a seat before it, dashed into a spirited selection from  Strauss.    Mrs. Leighton listened with surprised approval.    \"Certainly you are a fine performer,\" she said. \"What--if I should  engage you--would you expect in the way of compensation?\"    \"How much time would you expect me to give?\"    \"Three hours daily--from nine to twelve.\"    \"I hardly know what to say. What did you expect to pay?\"    \"About fifty cents an hour.\"    Florence knew very well, from the sums that had been paid for her own  education, that this was miserably small pay; but it was much more  than she could earn by sewing.    \"I will teach a month on those terms,\" she said, after a pause.    Mrs. Leighton looked well pleased. She knew that she was making a  great bargain.    \"Oh, by the way,\" she said, \"can you give references?\"    \"I can refer you to Madam Morrison,\" naming the head of a celebrated  female seminary. \"She educated me.\"    \"That will be quite satisfactory,\" said Mrs. Leighton, graciously.  \"Can you begin to-morrow?\"    \"Yes, madam.\"    \"You will then see your pupil. At present she is out.\"    Florence bowed and withdrew.    She had been afraid Mrs. Leighton would inquire where she lived, and  she would hardly dare to name the humble street which she called home.    She walked toward Fifth Avenue, when, just as she was turning the  corner, she met Mr. Percy de Brabazon, swinging a slender cane, and  dressed in the extreme of the fashion.    \"Miss Linden!\" he exclaimed, eagerly. \"This is--aw--indeed a pleasure.  Where are you walking this fine morning? May I--aw--have the pleasure  of accompanying you?\"    Florence stopped short in deep embarrassment.          Chapter XII.  A Friend, Though A Dude.      Percy de Brabazon looked sincerely glad to meet Florence, and she  herself felt some pleasure in meeting one who reminded her of her  former life.    But it was quite impossible that she should allow him to accompany her  to her poor home on the East Side.    \"Thank you, Mr. de Brabazon, but my engagements this morning will  hardly permit me to accept your escort,\" she said.    \"I suppose that means that you are going shopping; but I don't mind  it, I assure you, and I will carry your bundles,\" he added,  magnanimously.    \"That would never do. What! the fashionable Mr. de Brabazon carrying  bundles? You would lose your social status.\"    \"I don't mind, Miss Florence, as long as you give me--aw--an approving  smile.\"    \"I will give it now, as I bid you good-morning.\"    \"May I--aw--have the pleasure of calling upon you to-morrow evening,  Miss Linden?\"    \"It is evident that you have not heard that I am no longer residing  with my uncle.\"    Mr. de Brabazon looked surprised.    \"No, I had not heard. May I ask--aw--where you are wesiding?\"    \"With friends,\" answered Florence, briefly. \"As you are a friend and  will be likely to hear it, I may as well mention that my uncle is  displeased with me, and has practically disowned me.\"    \"Then, Miss Florence,\" said Mr. de"]]]
