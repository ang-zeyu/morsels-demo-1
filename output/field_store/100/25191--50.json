I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one of  them was a crafty old sophister, and the other a mere novice. Bradford  left me with Keimer, who was greatly surpris'd when I told him who the  old man was.    Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,  and one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then using  himself, composing an Elegy on Aquilla Rose, before mentioned, an  ingenious young man, of excellent character, much respected in the  town, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet. Keimer made verses  too, but very indifferently. He could not be said to write them, for  his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.  So there being no copy,[27] but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likely  to require all the letter, no one could help him. I endeavour'd to put  his press (which he had not yet us'd, and of which he understood  nothing) into order fit to be work'd with; and, promising to come and  print off his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready, I  return'd to Bradford's, who gave me a little job to do for the  present, and there I lodged and dieted. A few days after, Keimer sent  for me to print off the Elegy. And now he had got another pair of  cases,[28] and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work.    These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.  Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer,  tho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of  presswork. He had been one of the French prophets,[29] and could act  their enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any  particular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very  ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of  the knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford's  while I work'd with him. He had a house, indeed, but without  furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr.  Read's before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest  and clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable  appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first  happen'd to see me eating my roll in the street.

They had as      mottoes \"No Taxes\" and \"Liberty of Conscience.\"    I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the  town, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very  pleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I lived  very agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiring  that any there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins,  who was in my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him. At length, an  incident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had  intended. I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop  that traded between Boston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, forty  miles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter  mentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure,  assuring me of their good will to me, and that everything would be  accommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted me  very earnestly. I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for his  advice, but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a  light as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.          IV    FIRST VISIT TO BOSTON      Sir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle,  and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter  came to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter. The  governor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age. He  said I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore should  be encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and,  if I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his  part, he would procure me the public business, and do me every other  service in his power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in  Boston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I  being at work together near the window, we saw the governor and  another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle),  finely dress'd, come directly across the street to our house, and  heard them at the door.    Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the  governor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension and  politeness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments,  desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made  myself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me  away with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to  taste, as he said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a little  surprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd.[30] I went, however,  with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of  Third-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up my  business, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and  Colonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influence  in procuring the public business of both governments.[31] On my  doubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he  would give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages,  and he did not doubt of prevailing with him. So it was concluded I  should return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's  letter recommending me to my father. In the meantime the intention was  to be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the  governor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great  honour I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable,  familiar, and friendly manner imaginable.        [30] Temple Franklin considered this specific figure      vulgar and changed it to \"stared with astonishment.\"        [31] Pennsylvania and Delaware.    About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston. I  took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me  an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and  strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as  a thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going down  the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were  oblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. We  arriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been  absent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my  br. Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me. My  unexpected appearance surpris'd the family; all were, however, very  glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to see  him at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than ever while in his  service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my  pockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver. He receiv'd me  not very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again.    [Illustration: The journeymen were inquisitive]    The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a  country it was, and how I lik'd it. I prais'd it much, and the happy  life I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it;  and, one of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd a  handful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of  raree-show[32] they had not been us'd to, paper being the money of  Boston.[33] Then I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch;  and, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave them a piece  of eight[34] to drink, and took my leave. This visit of mine offended  him extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoke to him of a  reconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on good terms together,  and that we might live for the future as brothers, he said I had  insulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never  forget or forgive it. In this, however, he was mistaken.        [32] A peep-show in a box.

Holmes returning  he show'd it to him, asked him if he knew Keith, and what kind of man  he was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to  think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of  being at man's estate. Holmes said what he could in favour of the  project, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it, and at  last, gave a flat denial to it. Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir  William, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me,  but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his  opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so  important, and for which the preparation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#9)"],[1,"the control of voluntary movement.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Different aspects of sections of the spinal  cord and of the roots of the spinal nerves from the cervical region: 1,  different views of anterior median fissure; 2, posterior fissure; 3,  anterior lateral depression for anterior roots; 4, posterior lateral  depression for posterior roots; 5 and 6, anterior and posterior roots,  respectively; 7, complete spinal nerve, formed by the union of the  anterior and posterior roots.]    THE SPINAL CORD.--The spinal cord proceeds from the base of the brain  downward about eighteen inches through a canal provided for it in the  vertebrae of the spinal column. It is composed of white matter on the  outside, and gray matter within. A deep fissure on the anterior side and  another on the posterior cleave the cord nearly in twain, resembling the  brain in this particular. The gray matter on the interior is in the form  of two crescents connected by a narrow bar.    The _peripheral_ nervous system consists of thirty-one pairs of  _nerves_, with their end-organs, branching off from the cord, and twelve  pairs that have their roots in the brain. Branches of these forty-three  pairs of nerves reach to every part of the periphery of the body and to  all the internal organs.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--The projection fibers of the brain. I-IX, the  first nine pairs of cranial nerves.]    It will help in understanding the peripheral system to remember that a  _nerve_ consists of a bundle of neurone fibers each wrapped in its  medullary sheath and sheath of Schwann. Around this bundle of neurones,  that is around the nerve, is still another wrapping, silvery-white,  called the neurilemma. The number of fibers going to make up a nerve  varies from about 5,000 to 100,000. Nerves can easily be identified in a  piece of lean beef, or even at the edge of a serious gash in one's own  flesh!    Bundles of sensory fibers constituting a sensory nerve root enter the  spinal cord on the posterior side through holes in the vertebrae. Similar  bundles of motor fibers in the form of a motor nerve root emerge from  the cord at the same level. Soon after their emergence from the cord,  these two nerves are wrapped together in the same sheath and proceed in  this way to the periphery of the body, where the sensory nerve usually  ends in a specialized _end-organ_ fitted to respond to some certain  stimulus from the outside world. The motor nerve ends in minute  filaments in the muscular organ which it governs. Both sensory and motor  nerves connect with fibers of like kind in the cord and these in turn  with the cortex, thus giving every part of the periphery direct  connection with the cortex.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Schematic diagram showing association fibers  connecting cortical centers with each other.--After JAMES and STARR.]    The _end-organs_ of the sensory nerves are nerve masses, some of them,  as the taste buds of the tongue, relatively simple; and others, as the  eye or ear, very complex. They are all alike in one particular; namely,  that each is fitted for its own particular work and can do no other.  Thus the eye is the end-organ of sight, and is a wonderfully complex  arrangement of nerve structure combined with refracting media, and  arranged to respond to the rapid ether waves of light. The ear has for  its essential part the specialized endings of the auditory nerve, and is  fitted to respond to the waves carried to it in the air, giving the  sensation of sound. The end-organs of touch, found in greatest  perfection in the finger tips, are of several kinds, all very  complicated in structure. And so on with each of the senses. Each  particular sense has some form of end-organ specially adapted to respond  to the kind of stimulus upon which its sensation depends, and each is  insensible to the stimuli of the others, much as the receiver of a  telephone will respond to the tones of our voice, but not to the touch  of our fingers as will the telegraph instrument, and _vice versa_. Thus  the eye is not affected by sounds, nor touch by light. Yet by means of  all the senses together we are able to come in contact with the material  world in a variety of ways.      5. LOCALIZATION OF FUNCTION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM    DIVISION OF LABOR.--Division of labor is the law in the organic world as  in the industrial. Animals of the lowest type, such as the amoeba, do  not have separate organs for respiration, digestion, assimilation,  elimination, etc., the one tissue performing all of these functions. But  in the higher forms each organ not only has its own specific work, but  even within the same organ each part has its own particular function  assigned. Thus we have seen that the two parts of the neurone probably  perform different functions, the cells generating energy and the fibers  transmitting it.    It will not seem strange, then, that there is also a division of labor  in the cellular matter itself in the nervous system. For example, the  little masses of ganglia which are distributed at intervals along the  nerves are probably for the purpose of reenforcing the nerve current,  much as the battery cells in the local telegraph office reenforce the  current from the central office. The cellular matter in the spinal cord  and lower parts of the brain has a very important work to perform in  receiving messages from the senses and responding to them in directing  the simpler reflex acts and movements which we learn to execute without  our consciousness being called upon, thus leaving the mind free from  these petty things to busy itself in higher ways. The cellular matter of  the cortex performs the highest functions of all, for through its  activity we have consciousness.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Side view of left hemisphere of human brain,  showing the principal localized areas.]    The gray matter of the cerebellum, the medulla, and the cord may receive  impressions from the senses and respond to them with movements, but  their response is in all cases wholly automatic and unconscious. A  person whose hemispheres had been injured in such a way as to interfere  with the activity of the cortex might still continue to perform most if  not all of the habitual movements of his life, but they would be  mechanical and not intelligent. He would lack all higher consciousness.  It is through the activity of this thin covering of cellular matter of  the cerebrum, the _cortex_, that our minds operate; here are received  stimuli from the different senses, and here sensations are experienced.  Here all our movements which are consciously directed have their origin.  And here all our thinking, feeling, and willing are done.    DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE CORTEX.--Nor does the division of labor in the  nervous system end with this assignment of work. The cortex itself  probably works essentially as a unit, yet it is through a shifting of  tensions from one area to another that it acts, now giving us a  sensation, now directing a movement, and now thinking a thought or  feeling an emotion. Localization of function is the rule here also.  Certain areas of the cortex are devoted chiefly to sensations, others to  motor impulses, and others to higher thought activities, yet in such a  way that all work together in perfect harmony, each reenforcing the  other and making its work significant. Thus the front portion of the  cortex seems to be devoted to the higher thought activities; the region  on both sides of the fissure of Rolando, to motor activities; and the  rear and lower parts to sensory activities; and all are bound together  and made to work together by the association fibers of the brain.    In the case of the higher thought activities, it is not probable that  one section of the frontal lobes of the cortex is set apart for  thinking, one for feeling, and one for willing, etc., but rather that  the whole frontal part of the cortex is concerned in each. In the motor  and sensory areas, however, the case is different; for here a still  further division of labor occurs. For example, in the motor region one  small area seems connected with movements of the head, one with the arm,  one with the leg, one with the face, and another with the organs of  speech; likewise in the sensory region, one area is devoted to vision,  one to hearing, one to taste and smell, and one to touch, etc. We must  bear in mind, however, that these regions are not mapped out as  accurately as are the boundaries of our states--that no part of the  brain is restricted wholly to either sensory or motor nerves, and that  no part works by itself independently of the rest of the brain. We name  a tract from the predominance of nerves which end there, or from the  chief functions which the area performs. The motor localization seems to  be the most perfect. Indeed, experimentation on the brains of monkeys  has been successful in mapping out motor areas so accurately that such  small centers as those connected with the bending of one particular leg  or the flexing of a thumb have been located. Yet each area of the cortex  is so connected with every other area by the millions of association  fibers that the whole brain is capable of working together as a unit,  thus unifying and harmonizing our thoughts, emotions, and acts.      6. FORMS OF SENSORY STIMULI    Let us next inquire how this mechanism of the nervous system is acted  upon in such a way as to give us sensations. In order to understand  this, we must first know that all forms of matter are composed of minute  atoms which are in constant motion, and by imparting this motion to the  air or the ether which surrounds them, are constantly radiating energy  in the form of minute waves throughout space. These waves, or  radiations, are incredibly rapid in some instances and rather slow in  others. In sending out its energy in the form of these waves, the  physical world is doing its part to permit us to form its"]]]
