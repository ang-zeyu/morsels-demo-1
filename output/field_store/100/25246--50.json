The  object produces upon us an action, and this action is felt; only, in  such cases, the fact of sensation comprises but a very small part of  the event. It only corresponds, by definition, to the actual action of  the object. Analysis after analysis has shown that we constantly  perceive far beyond this actual action of objects. Our mind, as we  say, outruns our senses. To our sensations, images come to attach  themselves which result from sensations anteriorly felt in analogous  circumstances. These images produce in us an illusion, and we take  them for sensations, so that we think we perceive something which is  but a remembrance or an idea; the reason being that our mind cannot  remain in action in the presence of a sensation, but unceasingly  labours to throw light upon it, to sound it, and to arrive at its  meaning, and consequently alters it by adding to it. This addition is  so constant, so unavoidable, that the existence of an isolated  sensation which should be perceived without the attachment of images,  without modification or interpretation, is well-nigh unrealisable in  the consciousness of an adult. It is a myth.    Let us, however, imagine this isolation to be possible, and that we  have before us a sensation free from any other element. What is this  sensation? Does it belong to the domain of physical or of moral  things? Is it a state of matter or of mind?    I can neither doubt nor dispute that sensation is, in part, a  psychological phenomenon, since I have admitted, by the very  definition I have given of it, that sensation implies consciousness.  We must, therefore, acknowledge those who define it as _a state of  consciousness_ to be right, but it would be more correct to call it  the _consciousness of a state_, and it is with regard to the nature of  this state that the question presents itself. It is only this state  which we will now take into consideration. It is understood that  sensation contains both an impression and a cognition. Let us leave  till later the study of the act of cognition, and deal with the  impression. Is this impression now of a physical or a mental nature?  Both the two opposing opinions have been upheld. In this there is  nothing astonishing, for in metaphysics one finds the expression of  every possible opinion. But a large, an immense majority of  philosophers has declared in favour of the psychological nature of the  impression. Without even making the above distinction between the  impression and the act of cognition, it has been admitted that the  entire sensation, taken _en bloc_, is a psychological phenomenon, a  modification of our consciousness and a peculiar state of our minds.  Descartes has even employed this very explicit formula: \"The objects  we perceive are within our understanding.\" It is curious to see how  little trouble authors take to demonstrate this opinion; they declare  it to be self-evident, which is a convenient way of avoiding all  proof. John Stuart Mill has no hesitation in affirming that: \"The  mind, in perceiving external objects, can only take notice of its own  conditions.\" And Renouvier expresses the same arbitrary assertion with  greater obscurity when he writes: \"The monad is constituted by this  relation: the connection of the subject with the object within the  subject.\"[15] In other words, it is laid down as an uncontrovertible  principle that \"the mental can only enter into direct relations with  the mental.\" That is what may be called \"the principle of Idealism.\"    This principle seems to me very disputable, and it is to me an  astonishing thing that the most resolute of sceptics--Hume, for  example--should have accepted it without hesitation. I shall first  enunciate my personal opinion, then make known another which only  differs from mine by a difference of words, and finally I will discuss  a third opinion, which seems to me radically wrong.    My personal opinion is that sensation is of a mixed nature. It is  psychical in so far as it implies an act of consciousness, and  physical otherwise. The impression on which the act of cognition  operates, that impression which is directly produced by the excitant  of the nervous system, seems to me, without any doubt, to be of an  entirely physical nature. This opinion, which I make mine own, has  only been upheld by very few philosophers--Thomas Reid perhaps, and  William Hamilton for certain; but neither has perceived its deep-lying  consequences.    What are the arguments on which I rely? They are of different orders,  and are arguments of fact and arguments of logic. I shall first appeal  to the natural conviction of those who have never ventured into  metaphysics. So long as no endeavour has been made to demonstrate the  contrary to them, they believe, with a natural and naive belief, that  matter is that which is seen, touched and felt, and that,  consequently, matter and our senses are confounded. They would be  greatly astonished to be informed that when we appear to perceive the  outer world, we simply perceive our ideas; that when we take the train  for Lyons we enter into one state of consciousness in order to attain  another state of consciousness.    Now, the adherents of this natural and naive opinion have, as they say  in the law, the right of possession (_possession d'etat_); they are  not plaintiffs but defendants; it is not for them to prove they are in  the right, it has to be proved against them that they are in the  wrong. Until this proof is forthcoming they have a presumption in  their favour.    Are we here making use of the argument of common opinion of mankind,  of which ancient philosophy made so evident an abuse? Yes, and no.  Yes, for we here adopt the general opinion. No, for we only adopt it  till the contrary be proved. But who can exhibit this proof to the  contrary? On a close examination of the question, it will be perceived  that sensation, taken as an object of cognition, becomes confused with  the properties of physical nature, and is identified with them, both  by its mode of apparition and by its content. By its mode of  apparition, sensation holds itself out as independent of us, for it is  at every instant an unexpected revelation, a source of fresh  cognitions, and it offers a development which takes place without and  in spite of our will; while its laws of co-existence and of succession  declare to us the order and march of the material universe. Besides,  by its content, sensation is confounded with matter. When a  philosopher seeks to represent to himself the properties of a material  object,--of a brain, for example--in order to contrast them with the  properties of a psychical activity, it is the properties of sensation  that he describes as material; and, in fact, it is by sensation, and  sensation alone, that we know these properties. Sensation is so little  distinct from them that it is an error to consider it as a means, a  process, an instrument for the knowledge of matter. All that we know  of matter is not known in or by sensation, but constitutes sensation  itself; it is not by the aid of sensation that we know colour; colour  is a sensation, and the same may be said of form, resistance, and the  whole series of the properties of matter. They are only our sensations  clothed with external bodies. It is therefore absolutely legitimate to  consider a part of our sensations, the object part, as being of  physical nature. This is the opinion to which I adhere.    We come to the second opinion we have formulated. It is, in appearance  at least, very different from the first. Its supporters agree that the  entire sensation, taken _en bloc_ and unanalysed, is to be termed a  psychological phenomenon. In this case, the act of consciousness,  included in the sensation, continues to represent a psychical element.  They suppose, besides, that the object on which this act operates is  psychical; and finally, they suppose that this object or this  impression was provoked in us by a physical reality which is kept in  concealment, which we do not perceive, and which remains unknowable.    This opinion is nowise absurd in itself: but let us examine its  consequences. If we admit this thesis, that sensations are  manifestations of mind which, although provoked by material causes,  are of a purely mental nature, we are forced to the conclusion that we  know none of the properties of material bodies, since we do not enter  into relations with these bodies. The object we apprehend by  perception is, according to this hypothesis, solely mental. To draw  therefrom any notion on material objects, it would have to be supposed  that, by some mysterious action, the mental which we know resembles  the physical which we do not know, that it retains the reflection of  it, or even that it allows its colour and form to pass, like a  transparent pellicle applied on the contour of bodies. Here are  hypotheses very odd in their realism. Unless we accept them, how is it  comprehensible that we can know anything whatever of physical nature?  We should be forced to acknowledge, following the example of several  philosophers, that the perception of the physical is an illusion.    As a compensation, that which this system takes from matter it  attributes to mind, which turns our familiar conceptions upside down.  The qualities of sensation detached from matter will, when applied to  mind, change its physiognomy. There are sensations of extent, weight,  space, and form. If these sensations are turned into psychical events,  we shall have to grant to these events, to these manifestations of the  mind, the properties of extent, of weight, of form. We shall have to  say that mind is a resisting thing, and that it has colour.    It may be said that this fantasy of language is not very serious. So  be it. But then what remains of the dualism of mind and matter? It is  at least singularly compromised.
