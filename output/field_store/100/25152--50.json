A thorough knowledge of the natural genesis of the       scale of western nations will be the best antidote to fads       founded upon ignorance of it. It is a curious commentary upon       this question that Wagner, in the opening of the third act of       _Tristan_ (bars 6 to 10), experimented with the whole-tone       scale and drew his pen through it, as was to be expected from       a composer whose every work proves the writer to have had the       pure scale inbred in him.\"    [Footnote 21: Stanford--Musical Composition (1911) p. 17.]    There may be some difference of opinion among acousticians as to whether  Mr. Stanford is correct in his scientific assumptions regarding the  difference between \"tempered\" and \"pure\" scales,[22] but even so, there  is a far more potent reason why the whole-step scale will probably never  become popular as the major and minor scales now are, viz., the fact  that it offers no possibility of _inculcating tonality feeling_, which  has always been the basis of even the simplest primitive music. Tonality  scales give rise to a feeling of alternate periods of contraction and  relaxation--an active tone (or chord) followed by a passive one, but no  such effect is possible in the whole-step scale, and it seems suitable  therefore only for that class of music whose outlines are _purposely  intended to be_ vague and indefinite--the impressionistic style of music  writing.    [Footnote 22: Recent tests in Germany seem to prove conclusively that  the _tempered_ scale is the scale ordinarily employed by both vocalists  and players on stringed instruments, and that the ideal of and agitation  for a _pure_ (_i.e._, _untempered_) scale in vocal and in string music  is somewhat of a myth.]          CHAPTER IX    AUXILIARY WORDS AND ENDINGS      96.

A working knowledge of these auxiliary terms will aid the student  greatly in arriving at the meaning of hundreds of terms without stopping  to look up each individual one.          CHAPTER X    MEASURE      97. From the standpoint of the eye, a _measure_ is that portion of the  staff found between two bars, (in certain cases this space may be less  than a measure, as _e.g._, at the beginning and end of a movement); but  from the standpoint of the ear a single, isolated measure is not  possible, and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form.    _Measures_ are similarly accented groups of evenly-spaced beats, each  group having at least one accented and one non-accented beat. The  strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure.    Two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical  measure:    (1) A group of even beats (or pulses), always felt, though not always  actually sounded, one or more of these beats being stronger than the  rest;    (2) Certain rhythmic figures ([Illustration], etc.) which form the  actual musical content of these groups.         The student will note the essential difference between rhythm       and measure. Rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a       series of beats (or pulses), while measure is the grouping of       these beats according to some specified system. In listening       to a piece of music, two hearers A and B may feel the _rhythm_       equally strongly, but A may subjectively group the beats       into--_one_, two | _one_, two |--etc., while B feels the       groups as--_one_, two, _three_, four | _one_, two, _three_,       four |--etc. Rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing,       inherent in the music itself, while measure is to a certain       extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have       adopted for practical purposes.    98. In _syncopation_ the normal system of accenting is temporarily  suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part  of the measure. Syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary  interruption of a normal series of accents, _i.e._, accenting a beat  that is usually not accented. Thus _e.g._, in Fig. 56, measure _one_ has  the regular system of accents normally found in four-quarter-measure,  (strong accent on one, secondary accent on three); but measure _three_  has only one accent, and it falls on the second beat.    [Illustration: Fig. 56.]    99. Measures are usually classified as _simple_ and _compound_. A  _simple measure_ is one which has but a single accent, _i.e._, the  measure cannot be divided into smaller constituent groups. There are two  main classes of simple measures, two-beat measure, and three-beat  measure. A _compound measure_ is (as its name implies) one made up by  combining two or more simple measures, or by the elaboration of a single  measure (in slow tempo) into several constituent groups. The principal  compound measures are four-beat and six-beat, both being referred to as  compound-duple measures. Five-beat, seven-beat, nine-beat, and  twelve-beat measures are also classified as compound measures.         An English writer[23] classifies measures as duple, triple, or       quadruple, specifying that a simple measure is one in which       each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided       into halves ([Illustration] etc.) and that a compound measure       is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted-note,       whose value can be divided into three parts, ([Illustration]).       There is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as       to the meaning of the words _simple_ and _compound_ when       applied in this connection, the principal question at issue       being whether four-beat measure is an individual variety, or       whether it is a variety compounded out of two-beat measures,       either by placing two of these in a group or by the       elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats,       as is often necessary in slow tempi. Perhaps the easiest way       out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true--but       in different compositions. That is, it is frequently       impossible to tell whether a composition that is being       listened to is in two-beat, or in four-beat measure; and yet       it _is_ sometimes possible so to discriminate. Since, however,       one cannot in the majority of cases distinguish between       two-beat and four-beat measures, it will probably be best to       leave the original classification intact and regard four-beat       measure as a compound variety.    [Footnote 23: Pearse--Rudiments of Musical Knowledge, p. 37.]    100. The _commonest varieties of measure_ are:         1. _Duple_ (sometimes called even measure, or even time), in       which there are two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#9)"],[1," Whatever may be said as to this reasoning, the system works well for the  male; for being thus sure that he is truly and ardently loved, and that  the more coy and reluctant he shows himself, the more determination  to secure him increases, he generally contrives to make his consent  dependent on such conditions as he thinks the best calculated to insure,  if not a blissful, at least a peaceful life. Each individual An has his  own hobbies, his own ways, his own predilections, and, whatever they may  be, he demands a promise of full and unrestrained concession to them.  This, in the pursuit of her object, the Gy readily promises; and as the  characteristic of this extraordinary people is an implicit veneration  for truth, and her word once given is never broken even by the giddiest  Gy, the conditions stipulated for are religiously observed. In fact,  notwithstanding all their abstract rights and powers, the Gy-ei are the  most amiable, conciliatory, and submissive wives I have ever seen even  in the happiest households above ground. It is an aphorism among them,  that \"where a Gy loves it is her pleasure to obey.\" It will be observed  that in the relationship of the sexes I have spoken only of marriage,  for such is the moral perfection to which this community has attained,  that any illicit connection is as little possible amongst them as it  would be to a couple of linnets during the time they agree to live in  pairs.        Chapter XI.      Nothing had more perplexed me in seeking to reconcile my sense to the  existence of regions extending below the surface of the earth, and  habitable by beings, if dissimilar from, still, in all material points  of organism, akin to those in the upper world, than the contradiction  thus presented to the doctrine in which, I believe, most geologists  and philosophers concur--viz., that though with us the sun is the great  source of heat, yet the deeper we go beneath the crust of the earth, the  greater is the increasing heat, being, it is said, found in the ratio of  a degree for every foot, commencing from fifty feet below the surface.  But though the domains of the tribe I speak of were, on the higher  ground, so comparatively near to the surface, that I could account for a  temperature, therein, suitable to organic life, yet even the ravines and  valleys of that realm were much less hot than philosophers would deem  possible at such a depth--certainly not warmer than the south of France,  or at least of Italy. And according to all the accounts I received, vast  tracts immeasurably deeper beneath the surface, and in which one might  have thought only salamanders could exist, were inhabited by innumerable  races organised like ourselves, I cannot pretend in any way to account  for a fact which is so at variance with the recognised laws of science,  nor could Zee much help me towards a solution of it. She did but  conjecture that sufficient allowance had not been made by our  philosophers for the extreme porousness of the interior earth--the  vastness of its cavities and irregularities, which served to create free  currents of air and frequent winds--and for the various modes in which  heat is evaporated and thrown off. She allowed, however, that there was  a depth at which the heat was deemed to be intolerable to such organised  life as was known to the experience of the Vril-ya, though their  philosophers believed that even in such places life of some kind, life  sentient, life intellectual, would be found abundant and thriving, could  the philosophers penetrate to it. \"Wherever the All-Good builds,\"  said she, \"there, be sure, He places inhabitants. He loves not empty  dwellings.\" She added, however, that many changes in temperature and  climate had been effected by the skill of the Vril-ya, and that the  agency of vril had been successfully employed in such changes. She  described a subtle and life-giving medium called Lai, which I suspect  to be identical with the ethereal oxygen of Dr. Lewins, wherein work all  the correlative forces united under the name of vril; and contended that  wherever this medium could be expanded, as it were, sufficiently for the  various agencies of vril to have ample play, a temperature congenial to  the highest forms of life could be secured. She said also, that it was  the belief of their naturalists that flowers and vegetation had been  produced originally (whether developed from seeds borne from the surface  of the earth in the earlier convulsions of nature, or imported by  the tribes that first sought refuge in cavernous hollows) through the  operations of the light constantly brought to bear on them, and the  gradual improvement in culture. She said also, that since the vril light  had superseded all other light-giving bodies, the colours of flower and  foliage had become more brilliant, and vegetation had acquired larger  growth.    Leaving these matters to the consideration of those better competent to  deal with them, I must now devote a few pages to the very interesting  questions connected with the language of the Vril-ya.        Chapter XII.      The language of the Vril-ya is peculiarly interesting, because it seems  to me to exhibit with great clearness the traces of the three main  transitions through which language passes in attaining to perfection of  form.    One of the most illustrious of recent philologists, Max Muller, in  arguing for the analogy between the strata of language and the strata  of the earth, lays down this absolute dogma: \"No language can, by  any possibility, be inflectional without having passed through the  agglutinative and isolating stratum. No language can be agglutinative  without clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum of  isolation.\"--'On the Stratification of Language,' p. 20.    Taking then the Chinese language as the best existing type of the  original isolating stratum, \"as the faithful photograph of man in his  leading-strings trying the muscles of his mind, groping his way, and so  delighted with his first successful grasps that he repeats them again  and again,\" (Max Muller, p. 3)--we have, in the language of the Vril-ya,  still \"clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum,\" the evidences  of the original isolation. It abounds in monosyllables, which are the  foundations of the language. The transition into the agglutinative  form marks an epoch that must have gradually extended through ages,  the written literature of which has only survived in a few fragments of  symbolical mythology and certain pithy sentences which have passed  into popular proverbs. With the extant literature of the Vril-ya the  inflectional stratum commences. No doubt at that time there must have  operated concurrent causes, in the fusion of races by some dominant  people, and the rise of some great literary phenomena by which the  form of language became arrested and fixed. As the inflectional stage  prevailed over the agglutinative, it is surprising to see how much more  boldly the original roots of the language project from the surface that  conceals them. In the old fragments and proverbs of the preceding stage  the monosyllables which compose those roots vanish amidst words of  enormous length, comprehending whole sentences from which no one part  can be disentangled from the other and employed separately. But when  the inflectional form of language became so far advanced as to have its  scholars and grammarians, they seem to have united in extirpating all  such polysynthetical or polysyllabic monsters, as devouring invaders of  the aboriginal forms. Words beyond three syllables became proscribed  as barbarous and in proportion as the language grew thus simplified it  increased in strength, in dignity, and in sweetness. Though now very  compressed in sound, it gains in clearness by that compression. By a  single letter, according to its position, they contrive to express  all that with civilised nations in our upper world it takes the waste,  sometimes of syllables, sometimes of sentences, to express. Let me here  cite one or two instances: An (which I will translate man), Ana (men);  the letter 's' is with them a letter implying multitude, according to  where it is placed; Sana means mankind; Ansa, a multitude of men. The  prefix of certain letters in their alphabet invariably denotes compound  significations. For instance, Gl (which with them is a single letter, as  'th' is a single letter with the Greeks) at the commencement of a word  infers an assemblage or union of things, sometimes kindred, sometimes  dissimilar--as Oon, a house; Gloon, a town (i. e., an assemblage of  houses). Ata is sorrow; Glata, a public calamity. Aur-an is the health  or wellbeing of a man; Glauran, the wellbeing of the state, the good of  the community; and a word constantly in ther mouths is A-glauran, which  denotes their political creed--viz., that \"the first principle of a  community is the good of all.\" Aub is invention; Sila, a tone in music.  Glaubsila, as uniting the ideas of invention and of musical intonation,  is the classical word for poetry--abbreviated, in ordinary conversation,  to Glaubs. Na, which with them is, like Gl, but a single letter, always,  when an initial, implies something antagonistic to life or joy or  comfort, resembling in this the Aryan root Nak, expressive of perishing  or destruction. Nax is darkness; Narl, death; Naria, sin or evil.  Nas--an uttermost condition of sin and evil--corruption. In writing,  they deem it irreverent to express the Supreme Being by any special  name. He is symbolized by what may be termed the heiroglyphic of a  pyramid, /\\. In prayer they address Him by a name which they deem too  sacred to confide to a stranger, and I know it not. In conversation they  generally use a periphrastic epithet, such as the All-Good. The letter  V, symbolical of the inverted pyramid, where it is an initial, nearly  always denotes excellence of power; as Vril, of which I"]]]
