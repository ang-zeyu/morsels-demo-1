[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#9)"],[1,"parties  are so evenly divided between rival leaders that the tribe divides, one  section going this way and the other that, until one of the leaders  gives in his submission; otherwise the quarrel is decided by the sword.    All these features of the Arabian tribal system of succession may be  noticed in the first elections to the Caliphate. As soon as it was known  that Mohammed was indeed dead, a conclave composed of the elders and  chief men of Islam, self-constituted and recognizing no special popular  mandate, assembled in the house of Omar ibn el Khattub. This conclave is  known to jurists as the _Ahl el helli wa el agde_, the people of the  loosing and the knotting, because they assumed the duty of solving the  knotty question of succession. A nice point had to be decided, just such  a one as has in all ages been the cause of civil war in Arabia. The  Prophet had left no son, but more than one near relation. Moreover, at  that moment the new nation of Islam was in danger of internal  disruption, and the religious and the civil elements in it were on the  point of taking up arms against each other. The two chief candidates  were Ali ibn Abutaleb and Abu Bekr, the one son-in-law and cousin and  the other father-in-law of Mohammed--Ali represented the civil, Abu Bekr  the religious party; and as it happened that the latter party was  predominant at Medina, it was on Abu Bekr that the choice fell. He was  recognized as head of the more powerful faction, and the chiefs gave him  their hands; while civil war was only prevented by the magnanimous  submission of Ali.    This form of succession is held by most Sunite doctors to be the  authentic form intended by the Prophet, nor did the three following  elections differ from it in any essential point. It is only noticed that  Abu Bekr designated Omar as the most fitting person to succeed him, and  so in a measure directed the choice of the Ahl el agde. The Caliph was  in each instance elected by the elders at Medina, and the choice  confirmed by its general acknowledgment elsewhere.    In the time of Ali, however, a new principle began to make its  appearance, which foreshadowed a change in the nature of the Caliphate.  The election of Abu Bekr, as I have said, was determined by the  predominant religious feeling of the day. He was the holiest man in  Islam, and his government was throughout strictly theocratic. He not  only administered the religious law, but was its interpreter and  architect. He sat every day in the _mejlis_, or open court of justice,  and decided there questions of divinity as well as of jurisprudence. He  publicly led the prayer in the Mosque, expounded the Koran, and preached  every Friday from the pulpit. He combined in his person all the  functions now divided between the Sheykh el Islam, the grand Mufti, and  the executive authorities. He was king and priest and magistrate, doctor  of civil and religious law, and supreme referee on all matters whether  of opinion or practice; he was, in a word, the Pope of Islam. Nor did  his three successors abate anything of Abu Bekr's pretensions. The only  power they delegated was the command of the Mussulman armies, which were  then overrunning the world, and the government of the provinces these  had conquered.    Ali, however, when he at last succeeded to the Caliphate, found himself  opposed by the very party whose candidate he had once been, and this  party had gathered strength in the interval. With the conquest of the  world worldly ideas had filled the hearts of Mussulmans, and a strong  reaction also had set in in favour of those specially national ideas of  Arabia which religious fervour had hitherto held in check. It was  natural, indeed inevitable, that this should be the case, for many  conquered nations had embraced the faith of Islam, and, as Mussulmans,  had become the equals of their conquerors, so that what elements of  pride existed in these found their gratification in ideas of race and  birth rather than of religion, ideas which the conquered races could not  share, and which were the special inheritance of Arabia.    The national party, then, had been reinforced, at the expense of the  religious, among the Koreysh, who were still at the head of all the  affairs of State. Their leader was Mawiyeh Ibn Ommiyeh, a man of  distinguished ability and of that charm of manner which high-born Arabs  know so well how to use to their political ends. He had for some years  been Governor of Syria, and was more popular there than the pious Ali;  and Syria, though not yet the nominal, was already the real seat of the  Mussulman Government. Mawiyeh therefore refused to accept Ali's election  at Medina as valid, and finding himself supported by a rival Ahl el agde  at Damascus, made that appeal to the sword which Arabian usage sanctions  as the ultimate right of all pretenders.    Religious writers agree in condemning Mawiyeh for his revolt; and while  his succession to Ali is accepted as legal, they place him on quite a  different level from the four Caliphs who preceded him. In Mawiyeh they  see fulfilled that prediction of their Prophet which announced that  Islam should be ruled for thirty years by an Imam, and ever after by a  King. Mawiyeh is, indeed, the type of all the later Mohammedan Emperors.  According to canon law, the head of the State is also head of the  religion; but Mawiyeh ceased to exercise religious functions in person.  These, unlike his predecessors, he delegated to others, and neither led  the prayer nor preached; nor was he held to be either the best or the  most learned man in Islam, as Abu Bekr and the rest had been.  Moreover--and this is the chief point noticed regarding him--he  introduced the system of dynastic heredity into the Caliphate,  nominating his son Yezid his successor in his own lifetime. The change,  advantageous as it was politically, is regarded as a religious falling  off. Henceforth the Caliphs, whether of the Ommiad or afterwards of the  Abbaside families, were not in reality elected, though the form of  confirmation by the Ulema was gone through; and they affected to succeed  by right of birth, not by the voice of the people.    During the whole period of the Arabian Caliphate we only notice one  Prince of the Faithful who busied himself much with religious learning,  and few who personally exercised the magisterial functions. Only once we  read of an Abbaside Caliph insisting on his right of leading the prayer,  and this was probably the effect of an accidental jealousy. As a rule  the temporal government of Islam was intrusted to a _Sadrazzam_, or  Grand Vizier, the spiritual duty of prayer to a _Naib_, or deputy Imam,  and the elaboration or interpretation of law and doctrine to such Ulema  or Mujtaheddin as could command a following. The character of the  Khalifeh, however, was still essentially sacred. He was of the Koreysh  and of the blood of the Prophet, and so was distinct from the other  princes of the world. As their political power decayed, the Abbasides  fell indeed into the hands of adventurers who even occasionally used  them as puppets for their own ambitious ends; but the office was  respected, and neither the Kurdish Saladdin, nor Togral Bey, nor Malek  Shah, nor any of the Seljukian Emirs el Amara dared meddle personally  with the title of Caliph.    The Ommiad dynasty, founded by Mawiyeh, reigned at Damascus eighty-five  years, and was then succeeded on a new appeal to the sword in A.D. 750  by the descendants of another branch of the Koreysh--the Beni Abbas--who  transferred the capital of Islam to Bagdad, and survived as temporal  sovereigns there for five hundred years.    This second period of Islam, though containing her greatest glories and  her highest worldly prosperity, is held to be less complete by divines  than the first thirty years which had preceded it. Islam was no longer  one. To say nothing of the Persian and Arabian schisms, the orthodox  world itself was divided, and rival Caliphs had established themselves  independently in Spain and Egypt. Moreover, during the last two  centuries the temporal power of the Caliphs was practically in  delegation to the Seljuk Turks, who acted as mayors of the palace, and  their spiritual power was unsupported by any show of sanctity or  learning. It was terminated forcibly by the pagan Holagu, who at the  head of the Mongols sacked Bagdad in 1258.    The third period of Caliphal history saw all temporal power wrested from  the Caliphs. Islam, on the destruction of the Arabian monarchy, resolved  itself into a number of separate States, each governed by its own Bey or  Sultan, who in his quality of temporal prince was head also of religion  within his own dominions. The Mongols, converted to the Faith of Mecca,  founded a Mohammedan empire in the east; the Seljuk Turks, replaced by  the Ottoman, reigned in Asia Minor; the Barbary States had their own  rulers; and Egypt was governed by that strange dynasty of slaves, the  Mameluke Sultans. Nowhere was a supreme temporal head of Islam to be  seen, and the name of Khalifeh as that of a reigning sovereign ceased  any longer to be heard of in the world. Only the nominal succession of  the Prophet was obscurely preserved at Cairo, whither the survivors of  the family of Abbas had betaken themselves on the massacre of their  house at Bagdad.    It is difficult to ascertain the precise position of these titular  Caliphs under the Mameluke monarchy in Egypt. That they were little  known to the world in general is certain; and one is sometimes tempted  to suspect the complete authenticity of the succession preserved through  them. Contemporary Christian writers do not mention them, and it is  evident from Sir John Mandeville and others that in Egypt the Egyptian  Sultan himself was talked of as head of the Mussulman religion. I have  heard their position compared with that of the present Sheykhs el Islam  at Constantinople--that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#9)"],[1,"it is bestowed  least; for the way which the world knows for honoring them is to drive  them out of the country and to grudge them a piece of bread and, in  short, they must be (as says St. Paul 1 Cor. 4, 13) as the filth of the  world and everybody's refuse and footrag.    Yet there is need that this also be urged upon the populace, that  those who would be Christians are under obligation in the sight of God  to esteem them worthy of double honor who minister to their souls, that  they deal well with them and provide for them. For that, God is willing  to add to you sufficient blessing and will not let you come to want.  But in this matter every one refuses and resists, and all are afraid  that they will perish from bodily want, and cannot now support one  respectable preacher, where formerly they filled ten fat paunches. In  this we also deserve that God deprive us of His Word and blessing, and  again allow preachers of lies to arise to lead us to the devil, and, in  addition, to drain our sweat and blood.    But those who keep in sight God's will and commandment have the  promise that everything which they bestow upon temporal and spiritual  fathers, and whatever they do to honor them, shall be richly  recompensed to them, so that they shall have, not bread, clothing, and  money for a year or two, but long life, support, and peace, and shall  be eternally rich and blessed. Therefore only do what is your duty, and  let God take care how He is to support you and provide for you  sufficiently. Since He has promised it, and has never yet lied, He will  not be found lying to you.    This ought indeed to encourage us, and give us hearts that would melt  in pleasure and love toward those to whom we owe honor, so that we  would raise our hands and joyfully thank God who has given us such  promises, for which we ought to run to the ends of the world [to the  remotest parts of India]. For although the whole world should combine,  it could not add an hour to our life or give us a single grain from the  earth. But God wishes to give you all exceeding abundantly according to  your heart's desire. He who despises and casts this to the winds is not  worthy ever to hear a word of God. This has now been stated more than  enough for all who belong under this commandment.    In addition, it would be well to preach to the parents also, and such  as bear their office, as to how they should deport themselves toward  those who are committed to them for their government. For although this  is not expressed in the Ten Commandments, it is nevertheless abundantly  enjoined in many places in the Scriptures. And God desires to have it  embraced in this commandment when He speaks of father and mother. For  He does not wish to have in this office and government knaves and  tyrants; nor does He assign to them this honor, that is, power and  authority to govern, that they should have themselves worshiped; but  they should consider that they are under obligations of obedience to  God; and that, first of all, they should earnestly and faithfully  discharge their office, not only to support and provide for the bodily  necessities of their children, servants, subjects, etc., but, most of  all, to train them to the honor and praise of God. Therefore do not  think that this is left to your pleasure and arbitrary will, but that  it is a strict command and injunction of God, to whom also you must  give account for it.    But here again the sad plight arises that no one perceives or heeds  this, and all live on as though God gave us children for our pleasure  or amusement, and servants that we should employ them like a cow or  ass, only for work, or as though we were only to gratify our wantonness  with our subjects, ignoring them, as though it were no concern of ours  what they learn or how they live; and no one is willing to see that  this is the command of the Supreme Majesty, who will most strictly call  us to account and punish us for it; nor that there is so great need to  be so seriously concerned about the young. For if we wish to have  excellent and apt persons both for civil and ecclesiastical government  we must spare no diligence, time, or cost in teaching and educating our  children, that they may serve God and the world, and we must not think  only how we may amass money and possessions for them. For God can  indeed without us support and make them rich, as He daily does. But for  this purpose He has given us children, and issued this command that we  should train and govern them according to His will, else He would have  no need of father and mother. Let every one know therefore, that it is  his duty, on peril of losing the divine favor, to bring up his  children above all things in the fear and knowledge of God, and if they  are talented, have them learn and study something, that they may be  employed for whatever need there is [to have them instructed and  trained in a liberal education, that men may be able to have their aid  in government and in whatever is necessary].    If that were done, God would also richly bless us and give us grace to  train men by whom land and people might be improved and likewise well  educated citizens, chaste and domestic wives, who afterwards would rear  godly children and servants. Here consider now what deadly injury you  are doing if you be negligent and fail on your part to bring up your  child to usefulness and piety, and how you bring upon yourself all sin  and wrath, thus earning hell by your own children, even though you be  otherwise pious and holy. And because this is disregarded, God so  fearfully punishes the world that there is no discipline, government,  or peace, of which we all complain, but do not see that it is our  fault; for as we train them, we have spoiled and disobedient children  and subjects. Let this be sufficient exhortation; for to draw this out  at length belongs to another time.    The Fifth Commandment.    Thou shalt not kill.    We have now completed both the spiritual and the temporal government,  that is, the divine and the paternal authority and obedience. But here  now we go forth from our house among our neighbors to learn how we  should live with one another, every one himself toward his neighbor.  Therefore God and government are not included in this commandment nor  is the power to kill, which they have taken away. For God has delegated  His authority to punish evil-doers to the government instead of  parents, who aforetime (as we read in Moses) were required to bring  their own children to judgment and sentence them to death. Therefore,  what is here forbidden is forbidden to the individual in his relation  to any one else, and not to the government.    Now this commandment is easy enough and has been often treated,  because we hear it annually in the Gospel of St. Matthew, 5, 21 ff.,  where Christ Himself explains and sums it up, namely, that we must not  kill neither with hand, heart, mouth, signs, gestures, help, nor  counsel. Therefore it is here forbidden to every one to be angry,  except those (as we said) who are in the place of God, that is, parents  and the government. For it is proper for God and for every one who is  in a divine estate to be angry, to reprove and punish, namely, on  account of those very persons who transgress this and the other  commandments.    But the cause and need of this commandment is that God well knows that  the world is evil, and that this life has much unhappiness; therefore  He has placed this and the other commandments between the good and the  evil. Now, as there are many assaults upon all commandments, so it  happens also in this commandment that we must live among many people  who do us harm, so that we have cause to be hostile to them.    As when your neighbor sees that you have a better house and home [a  larger family and more fertile fields], greater possessions and fortune  from God than he, he is sulky, envies you, and speaks no good of you.    Thus by the devil's incitement you will get many enemies who cannot  bear to see you have any good, either bodily or spiritual. When we see  such people, our hearts, in turn, would rage and bleed and take  vengeance. Then there arise cursing and blows, from which follow  finally misery and murder. Here, now, God like a kind father steps in  ahead of Us, interposes and wishes to have the quarrel settled, that no  misfortune come of it, nor one destroy another. And briefly He would  hereby protect, set free, and keep in peace every one against the crime  and violence of every one else; and would have this commandment placed  as a wall, fortress, and refuge about our neighbor, that we do him no  hurt nor harm in his body.    Thus this commandment aims at this, that no one offend his neighbor on  account of any evil deed, even though he have fully deserved it. For  where murder is forbidden, all cause also is forbidden whence murder  may originate. For many a one, although he does not kill, yet curses  and utters a wish, which would stop a person from running far if it  were to strike him in the neck [makes imprecations, which if fulfilled  with respect to any one, he would not live long]. Now since this  inheres in every one by nature and it is a common practice that no one  is willing to suffer at the hands of another, God wishes to remove the  root and source by which the heart is embittered against our neighbor,  and to accustom us ever to keep in view this commandment, always to  contemplate ourselves in it as in a mirror, to regard the will of God,  and with hearty confidence and invocation of His name to commit to Him  the wrong which we suffer. Thus we shall suffer our enemies to rage and  be angry, doing what they can, and we learn to calm our wrath, and to  have a patient, gentle heart, especially toward those who give us cause  to be angry, that is, our enemies.    Therefore the entire sum of what it means not to kill is to be  impressed most explicitly upon "]]]
