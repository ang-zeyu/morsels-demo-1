These things do I hope for, out of the bounties and the bestowals of the  Beloved.    At all times do I speak of you and call you to mind. I pray unto the Lord,  and with tears I implore Him to rain down all these blessings upon you,  and gladden your hearts, and make blissful your souls, and grant you  exceeding joy and heavenly delights....    O Thou loving Provider! These souls have hearkened to the summons of the  Kingdom, and have gazed upon the glory of the Sun of Truth. They have  risen upward to the refreshing skies of love; they are enamoured of Thy  nature, and they worship Thy beauty. Unto Thee have they turned  themselves, speaking together of Thee, seeking out Thy dwelling, and  thirsting for the waterbrooks of Thy heavenly realm.    Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Ever-loving.            18: O THOU POSSESSOR OF A SEEING HEART! ALTHOUGH, ...      O thou possessor of a seeing heart! Although, materially speaking, thou  art deprived of physical sight, yet, praise be to God, spiritual insight  is thine. Thy heart seeth and thy spirit heareth. Bodily sight is subject  to a thousand maladies and assuredly will ultimately be lost. Thus no  importance should be attached to it. But the sight of the heart is  illumined. It discerneth and discovereth the divine Kingdom. It is  everlasting and eternal. Praise God, therefore, that the sight of thy  heart is illumined, and the hearing of thy mind responsive.    Each of the meetings ye have organized, wherein ye feel heavenly emotions  and comprehend realities and significances, is like unto the firmament,  and those souls are as resplendent stars shining with the light of  guidance.    Happy is the soul that seeketh, in this brilliant era, heavenly teachings,  and blessed is the heart which is stirred and attracted by the love of  God.            19: PRAISE BE TO HIM THROUGH WHOSE SPLENDOURS THE ...      Praise be to Him through Whose splendours the earth and the heavens are  aglow, through Whose fragrant breathings the gardens of holiness that  adorn the hearts of the chosen are trembling for joy, to Him Who hath shed  His light and brightened the face of the firmament. Verily there appeared  luminous and sparkling stars, glittering, shining out, and casting forth  their rays upon the supreme horizon. They derived their grace and  brilliance from the bounties of the Abha Realm, then, stars of guidance,  they poured down their lights upon this earth.    Praise be to Him Who hath fashioned this new era, this age of majesty,  even as an unfolding pageant where the realities of all things can be  exposed to view. Now are clouds of bounty raining down and the gifts of  the loving Lord are clearly manifest; for both the seen and the unseen  worlds have been illumined, and the Promised One hath come to earth and  the beauty of the Adored One hath shone forth.    Salutations, blessings, and welcome to that Universal Reality, that  Perfect Word, that Manifest Book, that Splendour which hath dawned in the  highest heaven, that Guide of all nations, that Light of the world--the  billowing ocean of Whose abounding grace hath flooded all creation, in  such wise that the waves thereof have cast upon the sands of this visible  world their shining pearls. Now hath the Truth appeared, and falsehood  fled away; now hath the day dawned and jubilation taken over, wherefore  men's souls are sanctified, their spirits purged, their hearts rejoiced,  their minds purified, their secret thoughts made wholesome, their  consciences washed clean, their inmost selves made holy: for the Day of  Resurrection hath come to pass, and the bestowals of thy Lord, the  Forgiving, have encompassed all things. Salutations and praise be unto  those luminous, resplendent stars that are shedding down their rays from  the highest heaven, those celestial bodies of the girdling zodiac of the  Abha Realm. May glory rest upon them.    And now, O thou honoured man who hath hearkened unto the Great  Announcement, rise up to serve the Cause of God with the resistless power  of the Abha Kingdom and the breaths that blow from the spirit of the  Company on high. Grieve thou not over what the Pharisees, and the  purveyors of false rumours among writers for the press, are saying of  Baha. Call thou to mind the days of Christ, and the afflictions heaped  upon Him by the people, and all the torments and tribulations inflicted  upon His disciples. Since ye are lovers of the Abha Beauty, ye also must,  for His love's sake, incur the peoples' blame, and all that befell those  of a former age must likewise befall you. Then will the faces of the  chosen be alight with the splendours of the Kingdom of God, and will shine  down the ages, yea, down all the cycles of time, while the deniers shall  remain in their manifest loss. It will be even as was said by the Lord  Christ: they shall persecute you for My name's sake.    Remind them of these words and say unto them: 'Verily did the Pharisees  rise up against Messiah, despite the bright beauty of His face and all His  comeliness, and they cried out that He was not Messiah [Masih] but a  monster [Masi_kh_], because He had claimed to be Almighty God, the  sovereign Lord of all, and told them, 'I am God's Son, and verily in the  inmost being of His only Son, His mighty Ward, clearly revealed with all  His attributes, all His perfections, standeth the Father.' This, they  said, was open blasphemy and slander against the Lord according to the  clear and irrefutable texts of the Old Testament. Therefore they passed  the sentence upon Him, decreeing that His blood be shed, and they hanged  Him on the cross, where He cried out, 'O My beloved Lord, how long wilt  Thou abandon Me to them? Lift Me up unto Thee, shelter Me close to Thee,  make Me a dwelling by Thy throne of glory. Verily art Thou the Answerer of  prayers, and Thou art the Clement, the Merciful. O My Lord! Verily this  world with all its vastness can no longer contain Me, and I love this  cross, out of love for Thy beauty, and yearning for Thy realm on high, and  because of this fire, fanned by the gusts of Thy holiness, aflame within  My heart. Help me, O Lord, to ascend unto Thee, sustain Me that I may  reach unto Thy sacred Threshold, O My loving Lord! Verily Thou art the  Merciful, the Possessor of great bounty! Verily Thou art the Generous!  Verily Thou art the Compassionate! Verily Thou art the All-Knowing! There  is none other God save Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful!'    Never would the Pharisees have been emboldened to calumniate Him and  charge Him with that grievous sin, but for their ignorance of the inner  core of mysteries and the fact that they paid no heed to His splendours  and regarded not His proofs. Else would they have acknowledged His words,  and borne witness to the verses He revealed, confessed the truth of His  utterances, sought shelter under the protective shadow of His banner,  learned of His signs and tokens, and rejoiced in His blissful tidings.    Know thou that the Divine Essence, which is called the Invisible of the  Invisibles, never to be described, beyond the reach of mind--is sanctified  above any mention, any definition or hint or allusion, any acclamation or  praise. In the sense that It is that It is, the intellect can never grasp  It, and the soul seeking knowledge of It is but a wanderer in the desert,  and far astray. 'No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision: He  is the Subtile, the All-Informed.'(18)    When, however, thou dost contemplate the innermost essence of all things,  and the individuality of each, thou wilt behold the signs of thy Lord's  mercy in every created thing, and see the spreading rays of His Names and  Attributes throughout all the realm of being, with evidences which none  will deny save the froward and the unaware. Then wilt thou observe that  the universe is a scroll that discloseth His hidden secrets, which are  preserved in the well-guarded Tablet. And not an atom of all the atoms in  existence, not a creature from amongst the creatures but speaketh His  praise and telleth of His attributes and names, revealeth the glory of His  might and guideth to His oneness and His mercy: and none will gainsay this  who hath ears to hear, eyes to see, and a mind that is sound.    And whensoever thou dost gaze upon creation all entire, and dost observe  the very atoms thereof, thou wilt note that the rays of the Sun of Truth  are shed upon all things and shining within them, and telling of that  Day-Star's splendours, Its mysteries, and the spreading of Its lights.  Look thou upon the trees, upon the blossoms and fruits, even upon the  stones. Here too wilt thou behold the Sun's rays shed upon them, clearly  visible within them, and manifested by them.    Shouldst thou, however, turn thy gaze unto a Mirror, brilliant, stainless,  and pure, wherein the divine Beauty is reflected, therein wilt thou find  the Sun shining with Its rays, Its heat, Its disc, Its fair form all  entire. For each separate entity possesseth its allotted portion of the  solar light and telleth of the Sun, but that Universal Reality in all Its  splendour, that stainless Mirror Whose qualities are appropriate to the  qualities of the Sun revealed within It--expresseth in their entirety the  attributes of the Source of Glory. And that Universal Reality is Man, the  divine Being, the Essence that abideth forever. 'Say, Call upon God, or  call upon the All-Merciful; whichsoever ye call upon, most beauteous are  His Names.'(19)    This is the meaning of the Messiah's words, that the Father is in the  Son.(20) Dost thou not see that should a stainless mirror proclaim,  'Verily is the sun ashine within me, together with all its qualities,  tokens and signs', such an utterance by such a mirror would be neither  deceptive nor false? No, by the One"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#9)"],[1,"of the Law  of God, which refers to material things, is modified and altered in each  prophetic cycle in accordance with the necessities of the times.    Briefly, what is meant by the term Holy of Holies is that spiritual Law  which will never be modified, altered or abrogated; and the Holy City  means the material Law which may be abrogated; and this material Law,  which is described as the Holy City, was to be trodden under foot for  twelve hundred and sixty years.    \"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a  thousand two hundred and three-score days, clothed in sackcloth.\"(38)  These two witnesses are Muhammad the Messenger of God, and 'Ali, son of  Abu Talib.    In the Qur'an it is said that God addressed Muhammad, the Messenger of  God, saying: \"We made You a Witness, a Herald of good news, and a  Warner\"--that is to say, We have established Thee as the witness, the giver  of good tidings, and as One bringing the wrath of God.(39) The meaning of  \"a witness\" is one by whose testimony things may be verified. The commands  of these two witnesses were to be performed for twelve hundred and sixty  days, each day signifying a year. Now, Muhammad was the root, and 'Ali the  branch, like Moses and Joshua. It is said they \"are clothed in sackcloth,\"  meaning that they, apparently, were to be clothed in old raiment, not in  new raiment; in other words, in the beginning they would possess no  splendor in the eyes of the people, nor would their Cause appear new; for  Muhammad's spiritual Law corresponds to that of Christ in the Gospel, and  most of His laws relating to material things correspond to those of the  Pentateuch. This is the meaning of the old raiment.    Then it is said: \"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks  standing before the God of the earth.\"(40) These two souls are likened to  olive trees because at that time all lamps were lighted by olive oil. The  meaning is two persons from whom that spirit of the wisdom of God, which  is the cause of the illumination of the world, appears. These lights of  God were to radiate and shine; therefore, they are likened to two  candlesticks: the candlestick is the abode of the light, and from it the  light shines forth. In the same way the light of guidance would shine and  radiate from these illumined souls.    Then it is said: \"They are standing before God,\" meaning that they are  standing in the service of God, and educating the creatures of God, such  as the barbarous nomad Arab tribes of the Arabian peninsula, whom they  educated in such a way that in those days they reached the highest degree  of civilization, and their fame and renown became worldwide.    \"And if any man would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and  devoureth their enemies.\"(41) That is to say, that no one would be able to  withstand them, that if a person wished to belittle their teachings and  their law, he would be surrounded and exterminated by this same law which  proceedeth out of their mouth; and everyone who attempted to injure, to  antagonize and to hate them would be destroyed by a command which would  come out of their mouth. And thus it happened: all their enemies were  vanquished, put to flight and annihilated. In this most evident way God  assisted them.    Afterward it is said: \"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not  in the days of their prophecy,\"(42) meaning that in that cycle they would  be like kings. The law and teachings of Muhammad, and the explanations and  commentaries of 'Ali, are a heavenly bounty; if they wish to give this  bounty, they have power to do so. If they do not wish it, the rain will  not fall: in this connection rain stands for bounty.    Then it is said: \"They have power over water to turn it to blood,\"(43)  meaning that the prophethood of Muhammad was the same as that of Moses,  and that the power of 'Ali was the same as that of Joshua: if they wished,  they could turn the water of the Nile into blood, so far as the Egyptians  and those who denied them were concerned--that is to say, that that which  was the cause of their life, through their ignorance and pride, became the  cause of their death. So the kingdom, wealth and power of Pharaoh and his  people, which were the causes of the life of the nation, became, through  their opposition, denial and pride, the cause of death, destruction,  dispersion, degradation and poverty. Hence these two witnesses have power  to destroy the nations.    Then it is said: \"And smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they  will,\"(44) meaning that they also would have the power and the material  force necessary to educate the wicked and those who are oppressors and  tyrants, for to these two witnesses God granted both outward and inward  power, that they might educate and correct the ferocious, bloodthirsty,  tyrannical nomad Arabs, who were like beasts of prey.    \"And when they shall have finished their testimony\"(45) means when they  should have performed that which they are commanded, and should have  delivered the divine message, promoting the Law of God and propagating the  heavenly teachings, to the intent that the signs of spiritual life might  be manifest in souls, and the light of the virtues of the world of  humanity might shine forth, until complete development should be brought  about among the nomad tribes.    \"The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall war against  them, and shall overcome them, and kill them\":(46) this beast means the  Umayyads who attacked them from the pit of error, and who rose against the  religion of Muhammad and against the reality of 'Ali--in other words, the  love of God.    It is said, \"The beast made war against these two witnesses\"(47)--that is  to say, a spiritual war, meaning that the beast would act in entire  opposition to the teachings, customs and institutions of these two  witnesses, to such an extent that the virtues and perfections which were  diffused by the power of those two witnesses among the peoples and tribes  would be entirely dispelled, and the animal nature and carnal desires  would conquer. Therefore, this beast making war against them would gain  the victory--meaning that the darkness of error coming from this beast was  to have ascendency over the horizons of the world, and kill those two  witnesses--in other words, that it would destroy the spiritual life which  they spread abroad in the midst of the nation, and entirely remove the  divine laws and teachings, treading under foot the Religion of God.  Nothing would thereafter remain but a lifeless body without spirit.    \"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which  spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was  crucified.\"(48) \"Their bodies\" means the Religion of God, and \"the street\"  means in public view. The meaning of \"Sodom and Egypt,\" the place \"where  also our Lord was crucified,\" is this region of Syria, and especially  Jerusalem, where the Umayyads then had their dominions; and it was here  that the Religion of God and the divine teachings first disappeared, and a  body without spirit remained. \"Their bodies\" represents the Religion of  God, which remained like a dead body without spirit.    \"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see  their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead  bodies to be put in graves.\"(49)    As it was before explained, in the terminology of the Holy Books three  days and a half signify three years and a half, and three years and a half  are forty and two months, and forty and two months twelve hundred and  sixty days; and as each day by the text of the Holy Book signifies one  year, the meaning is that for twelve hundred and sixty years, which is the  cycle of the Qur'an, the nations, tribes and peoples would look at their  bodies--that is to say, that they would make a spectacle of the Religion of  God: though they would not act in accordance with it, still, they would  not suffer their bodies--meaning the Religion of God--to be put in the  grave. That is to say, that in appearance they would cling to the Religion  of God and not allow it to completely disappear from their midst, nor the  body of it to be entirely destroyed and annihilated. Nay, in reality they  would leave it, while outwardly preserving its name and remembrance.    Those \"kindreds, people and nations\" signify those who are gathered under  the shadow of the Qur'an, not permitting the Cause and Law of God to be,  in outward appearance, entirely destroyed and annihilated--for there are  prayer and fasting among them--but the fundamental principles of the  Religion of God, which are morals and conduct, with the knowledge of  divine mysteries, have disappeared; the light of the virtues of the world  of humanity, which is the result of the love and knowledge of God, is  extinguished; and the darkness of tyranny, oppression, satanic passions  and desires has become victorious. The body of the Law of God, like a  corpse, has been exposed to public view for twelve hundred and sixty days,  each day being counted as a year, and this period is the cycle of  Muhammad.    The people forfeited all that these two persons had established, which was  the foundation of the Law of God, and destroyed the virtues of the world  of humanity, which are the divine gifts and the spirit of this religion,  to such a degree that truthfulness, justice, love, union, purity,  sanctity, detachment and all the divine qualities departed from among  them. In the religion only prayers and fasting persisted; this condition  lasted for twelve hundred and sixty years, which is the duration of the  cycle of the Furqan.(50) It was as if these two persons were dead, and  their bodies were remaining without spirit.    \"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make  merry, and shall send gifts to one another, because these two"]]]
