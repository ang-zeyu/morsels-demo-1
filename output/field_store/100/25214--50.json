[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20638"],[0,"From Plotzk to Boston (#9)"],[1," against the walls, I came  on deck. But it was worse. The green water, tossing up the white foam,  rocking all around, as far as I dared to look, was frightful to me then.  So I crawled back as well as I could, and nobody else tried to go out.    By and by the doctor and the steward came. The doctor asked each  passenger if they were well, but only smiled when all begged for some  medicine to take away the dreadful suffering. To those who suffered from  anything besides seasickness he sent medicine and special food later  on. His companion appointed one of the men passengers for every twelve  or fifteen to carry the meals from the kitchen, giving them cards to get  it with. For our group a young German was appointed, who was making the  journey for the second time, with his mother and sister. We were great  friends with them during the journey.    The doctor went away soon, leaving the sufferers in the same sad  condition. At twelve, a sailor announced that dinner was ready, and the  man brought it--large tin pails and basins of soup, meat, cabbage,  potatoes, and pudding (the last was allowed only once a week); and  almost all of it was thrown away, as only a few men ate. The rest  couldn't bear even the smell of food. It was the same with the supper at  six o'clock. At three milk had been brought for the babies, and brown  bread (a treat) with coffee for the rest. But after supper the daily  allowance of fresh water was brought, and this soon disappeared and more  called for, which was refused, although we lived on water alone for a  week.    At last the day was gone, and much we had borne in it. Night came, but  brought little relief. Some did fall asleep, and forgot suffering for a  few hours. I was awake late. The ship was quieter, and everything sadder  than by daylight. I thought of all we had gone through till we had got  on board the \"Polynesia\"; of the parting from all friends and things we  loved, forever, as far as we knew; of the strange experience at various  strange places; of the kind friends who helped us, and the rough  officers who commanded us; of the quarantine, the hunger, then the happy  news, and the coming on board. Of all this I thought, and remembered  that we were far away from friends, and longed for them, that I might be  made well by speaking to them. And every minute was making the distance  between us greater, a meeting more impossible. Then I remembered why we  were crossing the ocean, and knew that it was worth the price. At last  the noise of the wheels overhead, and the dull roar of the sea, rocked  me to sleep.    For a short time only. The ship was tossed about more than the day  before, and the great waves sounded like distant thunder as they beat  against it, and rolled across the deck and entered the cabin. We found,  however, that we were better, though very weak. We managed to go on deck  in the afternoon, when it was calm enough. A little band was playing,  and a few young sailors and German girls tried even to dance; but it was  impossible.    As I sat in a corner where no waves could reach me, holding on to a  rope, I tried to take in the grand scene. There was the mighty ocean I  had heard of only, spreading out its rough breadth far, far around, its  waves giving out deep, angry tones, and throwing up walls of spray into  the air. There was the sky, like the sea, full of ridges of darkest  clouds, bending to meet the waves, and following their motions and  frowning and threatening. And there was the \"Polynesia\" in the midst of  this world of gloom, and anger, and distance. I saw these, but  indistinctly, not half comprehending the wonderful picture. For the  suffering had left me dull and tired out. I only knew that I was sad,  and everybody else was the same.    Another day gone, and we congratulate one another that seasickness  lasted only one day with us. So we go to sleep.    Oh, the sad mistake! For six days longer we remain in our berths,  miserable and unable to eat. It is a long fast, hardly interrupted,  during which we know that the weather is unchanged, the sky dark, the  sea stormy.    On the eighth day out we are again able to be about. I went around  everywhere, exploring every corner, and learning much from the sailors;  but I never remembered the names of the various things I asked about,  they were so many, and some German names hard to learn. We all made  friends with the captain and other officers, and many of the passengers.  The little band played regularly on certain days, and the sailors and  girls had a good many dances, though often they were swept by a wave  across the deck, quite out of time. The children were allowed to play on  deck, but carefully watched.    Still the weather continued the same, or changing slightly. But I was  able now to see all the grandeur of my surroundings, notwithstanding the  weather.    Oh, what solemn thoughts I had! How deeply I felt the greatness, the  power of the scene! The immeasurable distance from horizon to horizon;  the huge billows forever changing their shapes--now only a wavy and  rolling plain, now a chain of great mountains, coming and going farther  away; then a town in the distance, perhaps, with spires and towers and  buildings of gigantic dimensions; and mostly a vast mass of uncertain  shapes, knocking against each other in fury, and seething and foaming in  their anger; the grey sky, with its mountains of gloomy clouds, flying,  moving with the waves, as it seemed, very near them; the absence of any  object besides the one ship; and the deep, solemn groans of the sea,  sounding as if all the voices of the world had been turned into sighs  and then gathered into that one mournful sound--so deeply did I feel the  presence of these things, that the feeling became one of awe, both  painful and sweet, and stirring and warming, and deep and calm and  grand.    I thought of tempests and shipwreck, of lives lost, treasures destroyed,  and all the tales I had heard of the misfortunes at sea, and knew I had  never before had such a clear idea of them. I tried to realize that I  saw only a part of an immense whole, and then my feelings were terrible  in their force. I was afraid of thinking then, but could not stop it. My  mind would go on working, till I was overcome by the strength and power  that was greater than myself. What I did at such times I do not know. I  must have been dazed.    After a while I could sit quietly and gaze far away. Then I would  imagine myself all alone on the ocean, and Robinson Crusoe was very real  to me. I was alone sometimes. I was aware of no human presence; I was  conscious only of sea and sky and something I did not understand. And as  I listened to its solemn voice, I felt as if I had found a friend, and  knew that I loved the ocean. It seemed as if it were within as well as  without, a part of myself; and I wondered how I had lived without it,  and if I could ever part with it.    The ocean spoke to me in other besides mournful or angry tones. I loved  even the angry voice, but when it became soothing, I could hear a sweet,  gentle accent that reached my soul rather than my ear. Perhaps I  imagined it. I do not know. What was real and what imaginary blended in  one. But I heard and felt it, and at such moments I wished I could live  on the sea forever, and thought that the sight of land would be very  unwelcome to me. I did not want to be near any person. Alone with the  ocean forever--that was my wish.    Leading a quiet life, the same every day, and thinking such thoughts,  feeling such emotions, the days were very long. I do not know how the  others passed the time, because I was so lost in my meditations. But  when the sky would smile for awhile--when a little sunlight broke a path  for itself through the heavy clouds, which disappeared as though  frightened; and when the sea looked more friendly, and changed its color  to match the heavens, which were higher up--then we would sit on deck  together, and laugh for mere happiness as we talked of the nearing  meeting, which the unusual fairness of the weather seemed to bring  nearer. Sometimes, at such minutes of sunshine and gladness, a few birds  would be seen making their swift journey to some point we did not know  of; sometimes among the light clouds, then almost touching the surface  of the waves. How shall I tell you what we felt at the sight? The birds  were like old friends to us, and brought back many memories, which  seemed very old, though really fresh. All felt sadder when the distance  became too great for us to see the dear little friends, though it was  not for a long time after their first appearance. We used to watch for  them, and often mistook the clouds for birds, and were thus  disappointed. When they did come, how envious we were of their wings! It  was a new thought to me that the birds had more power than man.    In this way the days went by. I thought my thoughts each day, as I  watched the scene, hoping to see a beautiful sunset some day. I never  did, to my disappointment. And each night, as I lay in my berth, waiting  for sleep, I wished I might be able even to hope for the happiness of a  sea-voyage after this had been ended.    Yet, when, on the twelfth day after leaving Hamburg, the captain  announced that we should see land before long, I rejoiced as much as  anybody else. We were so excited with expectation that nothing else was  heard but the talk of the happy arrival, now so near. Some were even  willing to stay up at night, to be the first ones to see the shores of  America. It was therefore a great disappointment when the captain said,  in the evening, that we would not reach Boston as soon as he expected,  on account of the weather.    A dense fog set in at night, and grew heavier and heavier, until the  \"Polynesia\" was closely walled in by it, and we could just see from one  end of the deck to the other. The signal lanterns were put up, the  passengers were driven to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#9)"],[1," afterwards the French, and then formed a third language between  them.    That the primitive manners are continued where the primitive language is  spoken, no nation will desire me to suppose, for the manners of  mountaineers are commonly savage, but they are rather produced by their  situation than derived from their ancestors.    Such seems to be the disposition of man, that whatever makes a  distinction produces rivalry.  England, before other causes of enmity  were found, was disturbed for some centuries by the contests of the  northern and southern counties; so that at Oxford, the peace of study  could for a long time be preserved only by chusing annually one of the  Proctors from each side of the Trent.  A tract intersected by many ridges  of mountains, naturally divides its inhabitants into petty nations, which  are made by a thousand causes enemies to each other.  Each will exalt its  own chiefs, each will boast the valour of its men, or the beauty of its  women, and every claim of superiority irritates competition; injuries  will sometimes be done, and be more injuriously defended; retaliation  will sometimes be attempted, and the debt exacted with too much interest.    In the Highlands it was a law, that if a robber was sheltered from  justice, any man of the same clan might be taken in his place.  This was  a kind of irregular justice, which, though necessary in savage times,  could hardly fail to end in a feud, and a feud once kindled among an idle  people with no variety of pursuits to divert their thoughts, burnt on for  ages either sullenly glowing in secret mischief, or openly blazing into  public violence.  Of the effects of this violent judicature, there are  not wanting memorials.  The cave is now to be seen to which one of the  Campbells, who had injured the Macdonalds, retired with a body of his own  clan.  The Macdonalds required the offender, and being refused, made a  fire at the mouth of the cave, by which he and his adherents were  suffocated together.    Mountaineers are warlike, because by their feuds and competitions they  consider themselves as surrounded with enemies, and are always prepared  to repel incursions, or to make them.  Like the Greeks in their  unpolished state, described by Thucydides, the Highlanders, till lately,  went always armed, and carried their weapons to visits, and to church.    Mountaineers are thievish, because they are poor, and having neither  manufactures nor commerce, can grow richer only by robbery.  They  regularly plunder their neighbours, for their neighbours are commonly  their enemies; and having lost that reverence for property, by which the  order of civil life is preserved, soon consider all as enemies, whom they  do not reckon as friends, and think themselves licensed to invade  whatever they are not obliged to protect.    By a strict administration of the laws, since the laws have been  introduced into the Highlands, this disposition to thievery is very much  represt.  Thirty years ago no herd had ever been conducted through the  mountains, without paying tribute in the night, to some of the clans; but  cattle are now driven, and passengers travel without danger, fear, or  molestation.    Among a warlike people, the quality of highest esteem is personal  courage, and with the ostentatious display of courage are closely  connected promptitude of offence and quickness of resentment.  The  Highlanders, before they were disarmed, were so addicted to quarrels,  that the boys used to follow any publick procession or ceremony, however  festive, or however solemn, in expectation of the battle, which was sure  to happen before the company dispersed.    Mountainous regions are sometimes so remote from the seat of government,  and so difficult of access, that they are very little under the influence  of the sovereign, or within the reach of national justice.  Law is  nothing without power; and the sentence of a distant court could not be  easily executed, nor perhaps very safely promulgated, among men  ignorantly proud and habitually violent, unconnected with the general  system, and accustomed to reverence only their own lords.  It has  therefore been necessary to erect many particular jurisdictions, and  commit the punishment of crimes, and the decision of right to the  proprietors of the country who could enforce their own decrees.  It  immediately appears that such judges will be often ignorant, and often  partial; but in the immaturity of political establishments no better  expedient could be found.  As government advances towards perfection,  provincial judicature is perhaps in every empire gradually abolished.    Those who had thus the dispensation of law, were by consequence  themselves lawless.  Their vassals had no shelter from outrages and  oppressions; but were condemned to endure, without resistance, the  caprices of wantonness, and the rage of cruelty.    In the Highlands, some great lords had an hereditary jurisdiction over  counties; and some chieftains over their own lands; till the final  conquest of the Highlands afforded an opportunity of crushing all the  local courts, and of extending the general benefits of equal law to the  low and the high, in the deepest recesses and obscurest corners.    While the chiefs had this resemblance of royalty, they had little  inclination to appeal, on any question, to superior judicatures.  A claim  of lands between two powerful lairds was decided like a contest for  dominion between sovereign powers.  They drew their forces into the  field, and right attended on the strongest.  This was, in ruder times,  the common practice, which the kings of Scotland could seldom control.    Even so lately as in the last years of King William, a battle was fought  at Mull Roy, on a plain a few miles to the south of Inverness, between  the clans of Mackintosh and Macdonald of Keppoch.  Col.  Macdonald, the  head of a small clan, refused to pay the dues demanded from him by  Mackintosh, as his superior lord.  They disdained the interposition of  judges and laws, and calling each his followers to maintain the dignity  of the clan, fought a formal battle, in which several considerable men  fell on the side of Mackintosh, without a complete victory to either.  This is said to have been the last open war made between the clans by  their own authority.    The Highland lords made treaties, and formed alliances, of which some  traces may still be found, and some consequences still remain as lasting  evidences of petty regality.  The terms of one of these confederacies  were, that each should support the other in the right, or in the wrong,  except against the king.    The inhabitants of mountains form distinct races, and are careful to  preserve their genealogies.  Men in a small district necessarily mingle  blood by intermarriages, and combine at last into one family, with a  common interest in the honour and disgrace of every individual.  Then  begins that union of affections, and co-operation of endeavours, that  constitute a clan.  They who consider themselves as ennobled by their  family, will think highly of their progenitors, and they who through  successive generations live always together in the same place, will  preserve local stories and hereditary prejudices.  Thus every Highlander  can talk of his ancestors, and recount the outrages which they suffered  from the wicked inhabitants of the next valley.    Such are the effects of habitation among mountains, and such were the  qualities of the Highlanders, while their rocks secluded them from the  rest of mankind, and kept them an unaltered and discriminated race.  They  are now losing their distinction, and hastening to mingle with the  general community.          GLENELG      We left Auknasheals and the Macraes its the afternoon, and in the evening  came to Ratiken, a high hill on which a road is cut, but so steep and  narrow, that it is very difficult.  There is now a design of making  another way round the bottom.  Upon one of the precipices, my horse,  weary with the steepness of the rise, staggered a little, and I called in  haste to the Highlander to hold him.  This was the only moment of my  journey, in which I thought myself endangered.    Having surmounted the hill at last, we were told that at Glenelg, on the  sea-side, we should come to a house of lime and slate and glass.  This  image of magnificence raised our expectation.  At last we came to our inn  weary and peevish, and began to inquire for meat and beds.    Of the provisions the negative catalogue was very copious.  Here was no  meat, no milk, no bread, no eggs, no wine.  We did not express much  satisfaction.  Here however we were to stay.  Whisky we might have, and I  believe at last they caught a fowl and killed it.  We had some bread, and  with that we prepared ourselves to be contented, when we had a very  eminent proof of Highland hospitality.  Along some miles of the way, in  the evening, a gentleman's servant had kept us company on foot with very  little notice on our part.  He left us near Glenelg, and we thought on  him no more till he came to us again, in about two hours, with a present  from his master of rum and sugar.  The man had mentioned his company, and  the gentleman, whose name, I think, is Gordon, well knowing the penury of  the place, had this attention to two men, whose names perhaps he had not  heard, by whom his kindness was not likely to be ever repaid, and who  could be recommended to him only by their necessities.    We were now to examine our lodging.  Out of one of the beds, on which we  were to repose, started up, at our entrance, a man black as a Cyclops  from the forge.  Other circumstances of no elegant recital concurred to  disgust us.  We had been frighted by a lady at Edinburgh, with  discouraging representations of Highland lodgings.  Sleep, however, was  necessary.  Our Highlanders had at last found some hay, with which the  inn could not supply them. "]]]
