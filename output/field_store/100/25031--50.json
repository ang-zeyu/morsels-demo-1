And the lucky  children, who could have anything in the wide world by just wishing for  it, hurriedly started for the gravel-pit to express their wishes to the  Psammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted on their taking  the Baby with them.    [Illustration: The lucky children ... hurriedly started for the gravel  pit]    \"Not want him indeed! Why, everybody 'ud want him, a duck! with all  their hearts they would; and you know you promised your ma to take him  out every blessed day,\" said Martha.    \"I know we did,\" said Robert in gloom, \"but I wish the Lamb wasn't quite  so young and small. It would be much better fun taking him out.\"    \"He'll mend of his youngness with time,\" said Martha; \"and as for  smallness, I don't think you'd fancy carrying of him any more, however  big he was. Besides he can walk a bit, bless his precious fat legs, a  ducky! He feels the benefit of the new-laid air, so he does, a pet!\"    With this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea's arms, and went  back to make new pinafores on the sewing-machine. She was a rapid  performer on this instrument.    The Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, \"Walky wif Panty,\" and rode on  Robert's back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane with stones,  and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could long be sorry  that he was of the party.    The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a week's  wishes to assuring the Baby's future, by asking such gifts for him as  the good fairies give to Infant Princes in proper fairy-tales, but  Anthea soberly reminded her that as the Sand-fairy's wishes only lasted  till sunset they could not ensure any benefit to the Baby's later years;  and Jane owned that it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in  two-shilling pieces, and buy the Lamb a three-pound fifteen  rocking-horse, like those in the big stores, with a part of the money.    It was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got  it, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again,  taking Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And  they would make a list of things they really wanted before they started.  Full of high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe  slow cart-road to the gravel-pits, and as they went in between the  mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned  their ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book. Being real  live children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather  blank and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday,  when they had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was  getting ready to fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright  guineas--millions of them--it had told the children to run along outside  the quarry for fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid  treasure. And they had run. And so it happened that they had not had  time to mark the spot where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as  before. And it was this thought that put such silly expressions on their  faces.    \"Never mind,\" said the hopeful Jane, \"we'll soon find him.\"    But this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and  they looked, and, though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could  they find the Sand-fairy.    At last they had to sit down and rest--not at all because they were  weary or disheartened, of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being  put down, and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have  happened to lose in the sand if you have an active baby to look after at  the same time. Get someone to drop your best knife in the sand next time  you go to the seashore and then take your baby brother with you when you  go to look for it, and you will see that I am right.    The Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country  air, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go  on talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found  the Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself.    He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into Anthea's  face, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand and waved his  fat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his eyes, as it  had into Anthea's, and he howled.    The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of ginger-beer  with him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed him. This had to  be uncorked hurriedly--it was the only wet thing within reach, and it  was necessary to wash the sand out of the Lamb's eyes somehow. Of course  the ginger hurt horribly, and he howled more than ever. And, amid his  anguish of kicking, the bottle was upset and the beautiful ginger-beer  frothed out into the sand and was lost for ever.    It was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot  himself as to say--    \"Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don't; Martha doesn't, not  really, or she'd jolly well keep him with her. He's a little nuisance,  that's what he is. It's too bad. I only wish everybody _did_ want him  with all their hearts; we might get some peace in our lives.\"    The Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that  there is only one safe way of taking things out of little children's  eyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you  love the Baby as much as you ought to do.    Then there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for  having been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either. You  often notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it  ought not to--and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one  who oughtn't to have said it is sorry.    The silence was broken by a sigh--a breath suddenly let out. The  children's heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each nose,  and somebody had pulled all the strings at once.    And everyone saw the Sand-fairy sitting quite close to them, with the  expression which it used as a smile on its hairy face.    \"Good-morning,\" it said; \"I did that quite easily! Everyone wants him  now.\"    \"It doesn't matter,\" said Robert sulkily, because he knew he had been  behaving rather like a pig. \"No matter who wants him--there's no one  here to--anyhow.\"    \"Ingratitude,\" said the Psammead, \"is a dreadful vice.\"    \"We're not ungrateful,\" Jane made haste to say, \"but we didn't _really_  want that wish. Robert only just said it. Can't you take it back and  give us a new one?\"    \"No--I can't,\" the Sand-fairy said shortly; \"chopping and changing--it's  not business. You ought to be careful what you _do_ wish. There was a  little boy once, he'd wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an  Ichthyosaurus, because he was too lazy to remember the easy names of  everyday things, and his father had been very vexed with him, and had  made him go to bed before tea-time, and wouldn't let him go out in the  nice flint boat along with the other children,--it was the annual  school-treat next day,--and he came and flung himself down near me on  the morning of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs  about and said he wished he was dead. And of course then he was.\"    \"How awful! said the children all together.    \"Only till sunset, of course,\" the Psammead said; \"still it was quite  enough for his father and mother. And he caught it when he woke up--I  tell you. He didn't turn to stone--I forget why--but there must have  been some reason. They didn't know being dead is only being asleep, and  you're bound to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep  or in some better place. You may be sure he caught it, giving them such  a turn. Why, he wasn't allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after  that. Nothing but oysters and periwinkles, and common things like that.\"    All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale. They looked  at the Psammead in horror. Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something  brown and furry was near him.    \"Poof, poof, poofy,\" he said, and made a grab.    [Illustration: \"Poof, poof, poofy,\" he said, and made a grab]    \"It's not a pussy,\" Anthea was beginning, when the Sand-fairy leaped  back.    \"Oh, my left whisker!\" it said; \"don't let him touch me. He's wet.\"    Its fur stood on end with horror--and indeed a good deal of the  ginger-beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb.    The Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and  a whirl of sand.    The children marked the spot with a ring of stones.    \"We may as well get along home,\" said Robert. \"I'll say I'm sorry; but  anyway if it's no good it's no harm, and we know where the sandy thing  is for to-morrow.\"    The others were noble. No one reproached Robert at all. Cyril picked up  the Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe  cart-road.    The cart-road from the gravel-pits joins the road almost directly.    At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from  Cyril's back to Robert's. And as they paused a very smart open carriage  came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside the  carriage a lady--very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace and  red ribbons and a parasol all red and white--and a white fluffy dog on  her lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the children,  and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children were  used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a \"very taking  child.\" So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her  to drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the coachman stop. And  she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the carriage she said--    \"What a dear darling duck of a baby!

But in the archaic period, with which       we are dealing, a star like the Babylonian sign may very       well have been used for \"god,\" and the title of Narmer's       sandal-bearer may read _Hen-neter_. He was the slave of the       living god Narmer. All Egyptian kings were regarded as       deities, more or less.    The monuments Khasekhemui, a king, show us that he conquered the North  also and slew 47,209 \"Northern Enemies.\" The contorted attitudes of the  dead Northerners were greatly admired and sketched at the time, and were  reproduced on the pedestal of the king's statue found by Mr. Quibell,  which is now at Oxford. It was an age of cheerful savage energy, like  most times when kingdoms and peoples are in the making. About 4000 B.C.  is the date of these various monuments.    [Illustration: 052.jpg OBVERSE OP A SLATE RELIEF.]    Khasekhemui probably lived later than Narmer, and we may suppose that  his conquest was in reality a re-conquest. He may have lived as late  as the time of the IId Dynasty, whereas Narmer must be placed at the  beginning of the Ist, and his conquest was probably that which first  united the two kingdoms of the South and North. As we shall see in  the next chapter, he is probably one of the originals of the legendary  \"Mena,\" who was regarded from the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty onwards  as the founder of the kingdom, and was first made known to Europe by  Herodotus, under the name of \"Menes.\"    [Illustration: 053.jpg REVERSE OF A SLATE RELIEF, REPRESENTING ANIMALS.]    Narmer is therefore the last of the ancient kings of Hierakonpolis, the  last of Manetho's \"Spirits.\" We may possibly have recovered the names of  one or two of the kings anterior to Narmer in the excavations at Abydos  (see Chapter II), but this is uncertain. To all intents and purposes we  have only legendary knowledge of the Southern kingdom until its close,  when Narmer the mighty went forth to strike down the Anu of the North,  an exploit which he recorded in votive monuments at Hierakonpolis, and  which was commemorated henceforward throughout Egyptian history in the  yearly \"Feast of the Smiting of the Anu.\" Then was Egypt for the first  time united, and the fortress of the \"White Wall,\" the \"Good Abode\" of  Memphis, was built to dominate the lower country. The Ist Dynasty was  founded and Egyptian history began.    [Illustration: 054.jpg ]          CHAPTER II--ABYDOS AND THE FIRST THREE DYNASTIES      Until the recent discoveries had been made, which have thrown so much  light upon the early history of Egypt, the traditional order and names  of the kings of the first three Egyptian dynasties were, in default of  more accurate information, retained by all writers on the history of the  period. The names were taken from the official lists of kings at Abydos  and elsewhere, and were divided into dynasties according to the system  of Manetho, whose names agree more or less with those of the lists and  were evidently derived from them ultimately. With regard to the fourth  and later dynasties it was clear that the king-lists were correct, as  their evidence agreed entirely with that of the contemporary monuments.  But no means existed of checking the lists of the first three dynasties,  as no contemporary monuments other than a IVth Dynasty mention of a IId  Dynasty king, Send, had been found. The lists dated from the time of  the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties, so that it was very possible that with  regard to the earliest dynasties they might not be very correct. This  conclusion gained additional weight from the fact that no monuments of  these earliest kings were ever discovered; it therefore seemed probable  that they were purely legendary figures, in whose time (if they ever did  exist) Egypt was still a semi-barbarous nation. The jejune stories told  about them by Manetho seemed to confirm this idea. Mena, the reputed  founder of the monarchy, was generally regarded as a historical figure,  owing to the persistence of his name in all ancient literary accounts  of the beginnings of Egyptian history; for it was but natural to suppose  that the name of the man who unified Egypt and founded Memphis would  endure in the mouths of the people. But with regard to his successors  no such supposition seemed probable, until the time of Sneferu and the  pyramid-builders.    This was the critical view. Another school of historians accepted all  the kings of the lists as historical _en bloc_, simply because the  Egyptians had registered their names as kings. To them Teta, Ateth, and  Ata were as historical as Mena.    Modern discovery has altered our view, and truth is seen to lie between  the opposing schools, as usual. The kings after Mena do not seem to be  such entirely unhistorical figures as the extreme critics thought;  the names of several of them, e.g. Merpeba, of the Ist Dynasty, are  correctly given in the later lists, and those of others were simply  misread, e. g. that of Semti of the same dynasty, misread \"Hesepti\" by  the list-makers. On the other hand, Mena himself has become a somewhat  doubtful quantity. The real names of most of the early monarchs of Egypt  have been recovered for us by the latest excavations, and we can now see  when the list-makers of the XIXth Dynasty were right and when they were  wrong, and can distinguish what is legendary in their work from what is  really historical. It is true that they very often appear to have been  wrong, but, on the other hand, they were sometimes unexpectedly near  the mark, and the general number and arrangement of their kings  seems correct; so that we can still go to them for assistance in the  arrangement of the names which are communicated to us by the newly  discovered monuments. Manetho's help, too, need never be despised  because he was a copyist of copyists; we can still use him to direct our  investigations, and his arrangement of dynasties must still remain the  framework of our chronological scheme, though he does not seem to have  been always correct as to the places in which the dynasties originated.    More than the names of the kings have the new discoveries communicated  to us. They have shed a flood of light on the beginnings of Egyptian  civilization and art, supplementing the recently ascertained facts  concerning the prehistoric age which have been described in the  preceding chapter. The impulse to these discoveries was given by the  work of M. de Morgan, who excavated sites of the early dynastic as  well as of the predynastic age. Among these was a great mastaba-tomb at  Nakada, which proved to be that of a very early king who bore the name  of Aha, \"the Fighter.\" The walls of this tomb are crenelated like  those of the early Babylonian palaces and the forts of the Northerners,  already referred to. M. de Morgan early perceived the difference between  the Neolithic antiquities and those of the later archaic period of  Egyptian civilization, to which the tomb at Nakada belonged. In the  second volume of his great work on the primitive antiquities of Egypt  _(L'Age des Metaux et le Tombeau Royale de Negadeh)_, he described  the antiquities of the Ist Dynasty which had been found at the time he  wrote. Antiquities of the same primitive period and even of an earlier  date had been discovered by Prof. Flinders Petrie, as has already been  said, at Koptos, at the mouth of the Wadi Hammamat. But though Prof.  Petrie correctly diagnosed the age of the great statues of the god  Min which he found, he was led, by his misdating of the \"New Race\"  antiquities from Ballas and Tukh, also to misdate several of the  primitive antiquities,--the lions and hawks, for instance, found at  Koptos, he placed in the period between the VIIth and Xth Dynasties;  whereas they can now, in the light of further discoveries at Abydos, be  seen to date to the earlier part of the Ist Dynasty, the time of Narmer  and Aha.    It is these discoveries at Abydos, coupled with those (already  described) of Mr. Quibell at Hierakonpolis, which have told us most of  what we know with regard to the history of the first three dynasties.  At Abydos Prof. Petrie was not himself the first in the field, the site  having already been partially explored by a French Egyptologist, M.  Amelineau. The excavations of M. Amelineau were, however, perhaps  not conducted strictly on scientific lines, and his results have been  insufficiently published with very few photographs, so that with the  best will in the world we are unable to give M. Amelineau the full  credit which is, no doubt, due to him for his work. The system of Prof.  Petrie's publications has been often, and with justice, criticized, but  he at least tells us every year what he has been doing, and gives us  photographs of everything he has found. For this reason the epoch-making  discoveries at Abydos have been coupled chiefly with the name of Prof.  Petrie, while that of M. Amelineau is rarely heard in connection with  them. As a matter of fact, however, M. Amelineau first excavated the  necropolis of the early kings at Abydos, and discovered most of the  tombs afterwards worked over by Prof. Petrie and Mr. Mace. Yet most of  the important scientific results are due to the later explorers, who  were the first to attempt a classification of them, though we must  add that this classification has not been entirely"]]]
