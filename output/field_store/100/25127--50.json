Throgmorton, about this time,       unwilling to intrust to letters the great secrets committed       to him, obtained leave, under some pretext, to come over to       London.    {1561.} Elizabeth was determined to make advantage of these events  against the queen of Scots, whom she still regarded as a dangerous  rival. She saw herself freed from the perils attending a union of  Scotland with France, and from the pretensions of so powerful a prince  as Francis; but she considered, at the same time, that the English  Catholics, who were numerous, and who were generally prejudiced in favor  of Mary's title, would now adhere to that princess with more zealous  attachment, when they saw that her succession no longer endangered the  liberties of the kingdom, and was rather attended with the advantage of  effecting an entire union with Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to  her ambassador, Throgmorton, a vigilant and able minister, to renew his  applications to the queen of Scots, and to require her ratification  of the treaty of Edinburgh. But though Mary had desisted, after her  husband's death, from bearing the arms and title of Queen of England,  she still declined gratifying Elizabeth in this momentous article; and  being swayed by the ambitious suggestions of her uncles, she refused to  make any formal renunciation of her pretensions.    Meanwhile the queen mother of France, who imputed to Mary all the  mortifications which she had met with during Francis's lifetime, took  care to retaliate on her by like injuries; and the queen of Scots,  finding her abode in France disagreeable, began to think of returning to  her native country. Lord James, who had been sent in deputation from the  states to invite her over, seconded these intentions; and she applied to  Elizabeth, by D'Oisel, for a safe-conduct, in case she should be obliged  to pass through England;[*] but she received for answer, that, till she  had given satisfaction, by ratifying the treaty of Edinburgh, she could  expect no favor from a person whom she had so much injured.         * Goodall, vol. i. p. 175.    This denial excited her indignation; and she made no scruple of  expressing her sentiments to Throgmorton, when he reiterated his  applications to gratify his mistress in a demand which he represented  as so reasonable. Having cleared the room of her attendants, she said to  him, \"How weak I may prove, or how far a woman's frailty may transport  me, I cannot tell: however, I am resolved not to have so many witnesses  of my infirmity as your mistress had at her audience of my ambassador  D'Oisel. There is nothing disturbs me so much, as the having asked,  with so much impunity, a favor which it was of no consequence for me to  obtain. I can, with God's leave, return to my own country without  _her_ leave; as I came to France, in spite of all the opposition of her  brother, King Edward: neither do I want friends both able and willing to  conduct me home, as they have brought me hither; though I was desirous  rather to make an experiment of your mistress's friendship, than of the  assistance of any other person. I have often heard you say, that a good  correspondence between her and myself would conduce much to the security  and happiness of both our kingdoms: were she well convinced of this  truth, she would hardly have denied me so small a request. But perhaps  she bears a better inclination to my rebellious subjects than to me,  their sovereign, her equal in royal dignity, her near relation, and the  undoubted heir of her kingdoms. Besides her friendship, I ask nothing at  her hands: I neither trouble her, nor concern myself in the affairs of  her state: not that I am ignorant, that there are now in England a great  many malecontents, who are no friends to the present establishment. She  is pleased to upbraid me as a person little experienced in the world: I  freely own it; but age will cure that defect. However, I am already  old enough to acquit myself honestly and courteously to my friends and  relations, and to encourage no reports of your mistress which would  misbecome a queen and her kinswoman. I would also say, by her leave,  that I am a queen as well as she, and not altogether friendless: and,  perhaps, I have as great a soul too; so that methinks we should be upon  a level in our treatment of each other. As soon as I have consulted the  states of my kingdom, I shall be ready to give her a seasonable answer;  and I am the more intent on my journey, in order to make the quicker  despatch in this affair. But she, it seems, intends to stop my journey;  so that either she will not let me give her satisfaction, or is resolved  not to be satisfied; perhaps on purpose to keep up the disagreement  between us. She has often reproached me with my being young; and I must  be very young indeed, and as ill advised, to treat of matters of such  great concern and importance without the advice of my parliament. I have  not been wanting in all friendly offices to her; but she disbelieves or  overlooks them. I could heartily wish that I were as nearly allied to  her in affection as in blood; for that indeed would be a most valuable  alliance.\"[*]         * Caballa, p. 374. Spotswood, p. 177.    Such a spirited reply, notwithstanding the obliging terms interspersed  in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between these rival  princesses, or cure those mutual jealousies which had already taken  place. Elizabeth equipped a fleet on pretence of pursuing pirates, but  probably with an intention of intercepting the queen of Scots in her  return homewards. Mary embarked at Calais; and passing the English fleet  in a fog, arrived safely at Leith, attended by her three uncles, the  duke of Aumale, the grand prior, and the marquis of Elbeuf, together  with the marquis of Damville and other French courtiers. This change of  abode and situation was very little agreeable to that princess. Besides  her natural prepossessions in favor of a country in which she had been  educated from her earliest infancy, and where she had borne so high a  rank, she could not forbear both regretting the society of that  people, so celebrated for their humane disposition and their respectful  attachment to their sovereign, and reflecting on the disparity of the  scene which lay before her. It is said, that after she was embarked at  Calais, she kept her eyes fixed on the coast of France, and never turned  them from that beloved object till darkness fell, and intercepted it  from her view. She then ordered a couch to be spread for her in the open  air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning the land were still  in sight, he should awake her, and afford her one parting view of that  country in which all her affections were centred. The weather proved  calm, so that the ship made little way in the night-time; and Mary had  once more an opportunity of seeing the French coast. She sat up on her  couch, and still looking towards the land, often repeated these words:  \"Farewell, France, farewell, I shall never see thee more.\"[*] The first  aspect, however, of things in Scotland was more favorable, if not to her  pleasure and happiness, at least to her repose and security, than she  had reason to apprehend. No sooner did the French galleys appear off  Leith, than people of all ranks, who had long expected their arrival,  flocked towards the shore with an earnest impatience to behold and  receive their young sovereign. Some were led by duty, some by interest,  some by curiosity; and all combined to express their attachment to her,  and to insinuate themselves into her confidence on the commencement of  her administration. She had now reached her nineteenth year; and  the bloom of her youth and amiable beauty of her person were further  recommended by the affability of her address, the politeness of her  manners, and the elegance of her genius. Well accomplished in all the  superficial but engaging graces of a court, she afforded, when better  known, still more promising indications of her character; and men  prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging deportment, and  penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of music, eloquence,  and poetry.[**] And as the Scots had long been deprived of the presence  of their sovereign, whom they once despaired ever more to behold among  them, her arrival seemed to give universal satisfaction; and nothing  appeared about the court but symptoms of affection, joy, and festivity.         * Keith, p. 179.

The first measures which Mary embraced confirmed all the prepossessions  entertained in her favor. She followed the advice given her in France  by D'Oisel and the bishop of Amiens, as well as her uncles; and she  bestowed her confidence entirely on the leaders of the reformed party,  who had greatest influence over the people, and who, she found, were  alone able to support her government. Her brother, Lord James, whom she  soon after created earl of Murray, obtained the chief authority; and  after him Lidington, secretary of state, a man of great sagacity, had a  principal share in her confidence. By the vigor of these men's measures,  she endeavored to establish order and justice in a country divided by  public factions and private feuds; and that fierce, intractable people,  unacquainted with laws and obedience, seemed, for a time, to submit  peaceably to her gentle and prudent administration.    But there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising  appearances, and bereaved Mary of that general favor which her agreeable  manners and judicious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E.

Let us not act like  Cambyses's judges, who, when their approbation was demanded by the  prince to some illegal measure, said, that 'Though there was a written  law, the Persian kings might follow their own will and pleasure.' This  was base flattery, fitter for our reproof than our imitation; and as  fear, so flattery, taketh away the judgment. For my part, I shall shun  both; and speak my mind with as much duty as any man to his majesty,  without neglecting the public.    \"But how can we express our affections while we retain our fears; or  speak of giving, till we know whether we have any thing to give? For if  his majesty may be persuaded to take what he will, what need we give?    \"That this hath been done, appeareth by the billeting of soldiers, a  thing nowise advantageous to the king's service, and a burden to the  commonwealth: by the imprisonment of gentlemen for refusing the loan,  who, if they had done the contrary for fear, had been as blamable as the  projector of that oppressive measure. To countenance these proceedings,  hath it not been preached in the pulpit, or rather prated, that 'All we  have is the king's by divine right'? But when preachers forsake their  own calling, and turn ignorant statesmen, we see how willing they are to  exchange a good conscience for a bishopric.    \"He, I must confess, is no good subject, who would not willingly and  cheerfully lay down his life, when that sacrifice may promote the  interests of his sovereign, and the good of the commonwealth. But he is  not a good subject, he is a slave, who will allow his goods to be taken  from him against his will, and his liberty against the laws of the  kingdom. By opposing these practices, we shall but tread in the steps  of our forefathers, who still preferred the public before their private  interest, nay, before their very lives. It will in us be a wrong done  to ourselves, to our posterities, to our consciences, if we forego this  claim and pretension.\"[*]         * Franklyn p. 243. Rushworth, vol. i, p. 499.    \"I read of a custom,\" said Sir Robert Philips, \"among the old Romans,  that once every year they held a solemn festival, in which their slaves  had liberty, without exception, to speak what they pleased, in order to  ease their afflicted minds; and, on the conclusion of the festival, the  slaves severally returned to their former servitudes.    \"This institution may, with some distinction, well set forth our present  state and condition. After the revolution of some time, and the grievous  sufferance of many violent oppressions, we have now at last, as those  slaves, obtained, for a day, some liberty of speech; but shall not, I  trust, be hereafter slaves: for we are born free. Yet what new illegal  burdens our estates and persons have groaned under, my heart yearns to  think of, my tongue falters to utter.----    \"The grievances by which we are oppressed, I draw under two heads; acts  of power against law, and the judgments of lawyers against our liberty.\"    Having mentioned three illegal judgments passed within his memory; that  by which the Scots, born after James's accession, were admitted to all  the privileges of English subjects;[** semi-colon inserted, not in scan]  that by which the new impositions had been warranted; and the late one,  by which arbitrary imprisonments were authorized; he thus proceeded:--    \"I can live, though another, who has no right, be put to live along with  me; nay, I can live, though burdened with impositions beyond what at  present I labor under: but to have my liberty, which is the soul of  my life, ravished from me to have my person pent up in a jail, without  relief by law, and to be so adjudged,--O, improvident ancestors!  O, unwise forefathers! to be so curious in providing for the quiet  possession of our lands, and the liberties of parliament; and at the  same time to neglect our personal liberty, and let us lie in prison, and  that during pleasure, without redress or remedy! If this be law, why  do we talk of liberties? why trouble ourselves with disputes about a  constitution, franchises, property of goods, and the like? What may any  man call his own, if not the liberty of his person?    \"I am weary of treading these ways; and therefore conclude to have  a select committee, in order to frame a petition to his majesty for  redress of these grievances. And this petition, being read, examined,  and approved, may be delivered to the king; of whose gracious answer we  have no cause to doubt, our desires being so reasonable, our intentions  so loyal, and the manner so dutiful. Neither need we fear that this is  the critical parliament, as has been insinuated; or that this is the way  to distraction: but assure ourselves of a happy issue. Then shall the  king, as he calls us his great council, find us his true council, and  own us his good council.\"[*]         * Franklyn, p. 245. Parl. Hist. vol. vii. p. 363. Rushworth,       vol i. p. 502.    The same topics were enforced by Sir Thomas Wentworth. After mentioning  projectors and ill ministers of state, \"These,\" said he, \"have  introduced a privy council, ravishing at once the spheres of all ancient  government; destroying all liberty; imprisoning us without bail or bond.  They have taken from us--What shall I say? Indeed, what have they left  us? By tearing up the roots of all property, they have taken from us  every means of supplying the king, and of ingratiating ourselves by  voluntary proofs of our duty and attachment towards him.    \"To the making whole all these breaches I shall apply myself, and to all  these diseases shall propound a remedy. By one and the same thing have  the king and the people been hurt, and by the same must they be cured.  We must vindicate--what? New things? No: our ancient, legal, and vital  liberties; by reenforcing the laws enacted by our ancestors; by setting  such a stamp upon them, that no licentious spirit shall dare henceforth  to invade them. And shall we think this a way to break a parliament? No:  our desires are modest and just. I speak both for the interest of king  and people. If we enjoy not these rights, it will be impossible for us  to relieve him. Let us never, therefore, doubt of a favorable reception  from his goodness.\"[*]    These sentiments were unanimously embraced by the whole house. Even the  court party pretended not to plead, in defence of the late measures,  any thing but the necessity to which the king had been reduced by the  obstinacy of the two former parliaments. A vote, therefore, was  passed, without opposition, against arbitrary imprisonments and forced  loans.[**] And the spirit of liberty having obtained some contentment  by this exertion, the reiterated messages of the king, who pressed for  supply, were attended to with more temper. Five subsidies were voted  him; with which, though much inferior to his wants, he declared himself  well satisfied; and even tears of affection started in his eye when  he was informed of this concession. The duke's approbation too was  mentioned by Secretary Coke; but the conjunction of a subject with the  sovereign was ill received by the house.[***] Though disgusted with the  king, the jealousy which they felt for his honor was more sensible than  that which his unbounded confidence in the duke would allow even himself  to entertain.         * Franklyn, p 243. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 500.         ** Franklyn, p. 251. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 513. Whitlocke,       p. 9         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 526, Whitlocke, p. 9.    The supply, though voted, was not as yet passed into a law; and the  commons resolved to employ the interval in providing some barriers to  their rights and liberties so lately violated. They knew that their  own vote, declaring the illegality of the former measures, had not, of  itself, sufficient authority to secure the constitution against future  invasion. Some act to that purpose must receive the sanction of the  whole legislature; and they appointed a committee to prepare the model  of so important a law. By collecting into one effort all the dangerous  and oppressive claims of his prerogative, Charles had exposed them to  the hazard of one assault and had further, by presenting a nearer view  of the consequences attending them, roused the independent genius of  the commons. Forced loans, benevolences, taxes without consent of  parliament, arbitrary imprisonments, the billeting of soldiers, martial  law; these were the grievances complained of, and against these an  eternal remedy was to be provided. The commons pretended not, as they  affirmed, to any unusual powers or privileges: they aimed only at  securing those which had been transmitted them from their ancestors: and  their law they resolved to call a Petition of Right; as implying that  it contained a corroboration or explanation of the ancient constitution,  not any infringement of royal prerogative, or acquisition of new  liberties.    While the committee was employed in framing the petition of right, the  favorers of each party, both in parliament and throughout the nation,  were engaged in disputes about this bill, which, in all likelihood, was  to form a memorable era in the English government.    That the statutes, said the partisans of the commons, which secure  English liberty, are not become obsolete, appears hence, that the  English have ever been free, and have ever been governed by law and a  limited constitution. Privileges in particular, which are founded on  the Great Charter, must always remain in force, because derived from  a source of never-failing authority, regarded in all ages as the most  sacred contract between king and people. Such attention was paid to this  charter by our generous ancestors, that they got the confirmation of it  reiterated thirty several times; and even secured it by a rule which,  though vulgarly received, seems in the execution impracticable. They  have established it as a maxim \"That even "]]]
