The valley  of Tintalous is looking fresh, on account of the great quantity of wild  cauliflower overspreading its surface, called by the Arabs _liftee_.  This word _liftee_, is evidently derived from _lift_, \"turnip.\" The  vegetable grows in lines and circles, determined apparently by the  action of the water, which deposits the seeds. No use is made of this  wild cabbage; it is very bitter, and no animals even eat it.    En-Noor paid me a visit this morning before I was up; he drank some  coffee, and went off to see his camels. The Tanelkums were quite wrong  in their surmisings about En-Noor and his religious fanaticism. He has  shown less fanaticism than any prince with whom we have had yet anything  to do during the present journey. All the Kailouees of Tintalous are  equally tolerant. We have now three quasi-princes, or sons of sultans,  in Tintalous, besides the son of En-Noor. We have Mousa Waled Haj-Ali,  who takes our despatches to Mourzuk, with Yusuf my interpreter, and a  Tibboo, the son of the Sultan of Kouivar. As we proceed onwards, princes  and sons of princes will thicken upon us.    _27th._--I packed up and sent off all my despatches to Mourzuk, together  with a few trifling things for my poor wife, by the hand of Mousa Waled  Haj-Ali, the virtual Sheikh of the Tanelkums.    _28th._--All the male inhabitants, with the exception of five or six,  have gone off this morning to fetch salt from Bilma. They return here in  the course of a month, and the greater part of the salt is transported  from hence to Soudan by the next caravan. We have heard of our friends  at Aghadez. They are expected here in a few days. The new Sultan of  Aghadez is said--but there is little accuracy in these desert  reports--to have gone on an expedition west, to settle some differences  between some tribes in arms against one another. The people also say  that the new Sultan is \"hungry,\" and is glad of such an opportunity to  get \"something to eat.\" This is the way in which they would describe a  Chancellor of the Exchequer planning a new tax.    Some say the object of the razzia is to chastise the Fadeea for  attacking us; but still the main object is to fill the Sultan's \"own  hungry belly.\" Such are Asbenouee politics.    _Bakin-Zakee_, the Soudanese name of the Kailouee green cap, I know here  means the \"_lion's mouth_.\" This is the phrase with which I always  salute Zangheema, En-Noor's chief slave; but the terms are much more  appropriate for his master, as intimating his avaricious, nay voracious,  disposition. Zangheema, however, might be called \"Karen Zakee,\"  the jackal of the lion, or \"the lion's provider,\" so anxious is he to  minister to the voracious appetite of his lord.    We have received the news that Dr. Barth is near. He is expected  to-morrow evening, or early next day.    _29th._--En-Noor paid me a visit at sunset to-day, and talked of how  many children people had in this country. His highness said he knew a  sultan in Soudan who had seven hundred children.    _30th._--The Gatronee of the Germans confirms the report of the  circumstance, that, when the Kailouees go to the Tibboos to trade for  salt, all the male Tibboos run away, leaving all the business in the  hands of the females; which latter, besides trading in salt with the  Kailouees, make a good mercantile speculation with their charms. Each  woman, in fact, has her Kailouee husband or lover, during the carrying  on of this singular commerce. If the traders catch a single Tibboo man  staying behind, they at once murder him, with the most marked  approbation of the Tibboo women. Such is the state of connubial fidelity  in this part of the Sahara.    The Tibboos have been very greatly neglected by persons writing on  Africa, chiefly on account of the slighting, summary way in which they  are spoken of by the members of the former English expedition to Bornou.  They are, however, divided into a great number of tribes, are spread  over a considerable extent of country, and are partly the guardians of  the Bornou route. We must pay them some attention when they come under  our observation.    There is a man come from Dr. Barth and his party. They are expected in  the course of forty-eight hours. En-Noor is very angry that they do not  mend their pace. We are all ready to start. An immense caravan is  waiting for their arrival.    _31st._--The people begin to pester me to marry another wife in  Soudan,--one very young and with large breasts is the kind of article  they recommend.    The mysteries of Tintalous are celebrated at the well in the evening,  under the bright, glowing light of Venus, which star is now seen a  couple of hours above the horizon after sunset. On the margin of the  well, which is on the other side of the wady, at the distance of a  quarter of a mile, the damsels of Tintalous regularly meet their lovers,  and spend with them half an hour of sweet communion. Some even retire to  the shade of a large-spreading tholukh near, or behind blocks of rock  rising on the edge of the valley, and indulge in lawful or unlawful  embraces. The strangers who come here, the Moors of Tripoli and Fezzan,  are freely initiated into these mysteries.    I am told by our servants, who have been round to all the villages or  towns in the neighbourhood of Tintalous for the purchase of ghaseb, that  these places, small or large, are none of them equal to Tintalous,  although the houses are much the same--bell-shaped huts, and the people  are of the same character. What has greatly astonished our servants is  the fewness of the men; indeed, in some villages they saw no other  persons but women and children, and scarcely any children. What is the  cause of this? It would seem that the men are consumed by the women.  These women bear few children, and perhaps this may in part account for,  if it be not produced by, their excessive licentiousness. Yet the men  are on the wing a great part of the year. The Kailouees, however,  wherever they go, have their women at hand, and during a journey many of  them take two or three female slaves. How is this superabundant supply  of the softer sex kept up? If I am noticing a mere temporary phenomenon,  the destruction of men in the razzias may account for the disproportion.  Besides, the Kailouees are always imparting fresh slaves into their  country.    The poor people of Tintalous are fed chiefly on the pounded grains of  the herb _bou rekaba_. It is a real Asbenouee dish. Overweg made a  supper of it one evening. I tasted it, and find it has a very strong  flavour of herbs; that is to say, what is commonly imagined to be the  flavour of herbs in general. The people now go a long way for wood. The  tholukh-trees of the valley are not allowed to be cut down; they are  always preserved as a resource for the time of drought and dearth, when  the flocks can find no herbage in the valley. The boughs are at such  junctures lopped off, and the flocks are fed on the leaves. Thus I have  seen the goats and sheep fed on the tholukh-leaves on the plains of  Mourzuk, as well as near this place. Another reason may induce En-Noor  to save the tholukh-trees,--that there may be a perpetual shade and  verdure in the valley of Tintalous. There are many finer valleys than  this in Asben, and were the trees not preserved, it would be a very  barren, unlively spot.    This evening, two hours after sunset, Venus exhibited her most splendid  phasis: the west, where she was setting, about half-an-hour before she  disappeared, was lit up as if it was moonlight. On concealing the  planet, the effect produced was that of the setting of the moon. Every  star was eclipsed in the western circle of the heavens, I never saw  anything before equal to this. I could here fully realise the words of  Scripture, that the stars were made also \"to give light upon the earth.\"    The manner of saluting and shaking hands amongst the Kailouees deserves  notice: they first hold up the right hand with the palm outspread, like  the Tuaricks of Ghat. Afterwards, when more companionable and familiar,  they take hold of hands, and press them lightly some five or six times  or more, if great friends, and conclude this pressing of the hand with a  sort of jerk, drawing quickly off each other's hand. In taking hold of  the hand of your friend, you fit your thumb in the circle formed by his  thumb and fingers, and every time you press his hand, and he presses  yours, you separate the hands from each other.[5]      [5] This mode of shaking hands is common among the Fellahs of        Egypt.--ED.    _Nov. 1st._--The month has set in with wind,--not gusts, but steady  wind, continually blowing from E.N.E. It is stated positively that we  leave here to-morrow morning, whether the people return or not from  Aghadez. I register all reports as I hear them, though perfectly aware  that we have not been yet quite let into the secret of the singular  migration in which we are about to bear a part. The greater number of  the men of Tintalous have gone to Bilma in search of salt; and I  originally understood that the great annual caravan was for the  transport of this necessary article. Perhaps En-Noor means to go slowly  on, just to keep us in good humour. Our intercourse with the Kailouees  has taught us to consider them a very mild, companionable race. Often  indeed, like children, I wonder what the Tibboos can see in them to make  them so desperately afraid, for I am told ten Kailouees will frighten  away fifty Tibboos of Bilma. But the Tibboos of Tibesty are considered a  braver race. It is worthy of remark, that these cowardly Tibboos have a  bad character, and, like most cowards, are very treacherous.    I determined not to carry the little box in which the two bottles of  champagne were packed any further; so I, Overweg, Yusuf, and the  servants, set to work and drank a bottle of it, to the toast, \"that we  might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18556"],[0,"Catalogue of Violent and Destructive Earthquakes in the Philippines (#9)"],[1," |                    |     |  122 |1881   IX 18  4 55  |VIII |Destructive earthquake in Nueva Vizcaya.      |                    |     |  123 |1881   IX 18 22 40  |VIII |Destructive earthquake in Nueva Vizcaya.      |                    |     |  124 |1881   IX 20 14 25  |VIII |Destructive earthquake in Nueva Vizcaya.      |                    |     |      |                    |     |This memorable seismic period of Nueva      |                    |     |Vizcaya ended after October 15.
