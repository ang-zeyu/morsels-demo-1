On the other hand, there are beardless as well as bearded races  in the world; and, by crossing them, you could, doubtless, soon produce  ups and downs in the razor-trade. Only, as Weismann's school would  say, the required variation is in this case spontaneous, that is, comes  entirely of its own accord.    Leaving the question of use-inheritance open, I pass on to say a word  about variation as considered in itself and apart from this doubtful  influence. Weismann holds, that organisms resulting from the union  of two cells are more variable than those produced out of a single  one. On this view, variation depends largely on the laws of the  interaction of the dissimilar characters brought together in  cell-union. But what are these laws? The best that can be said is that  we are getting to know a little more about them every day. Amongst  other lines of inquiry, the so-called Mendelian experiments promise  to clear up much that is at present dark.    The development of the individual that results from such cell-union  is no mere mixture or addition, but a process of selective organization.  To put it very absurdly, one does not find a pair of two-legged parents  having a child with legs as big as the two sets of legs together, or  with four legs, two of them of one shape and two of another. In other  words, of the possibilities contributed by the father and mother, some  are taken and some are left in the case of any one child. Further,  different children will represent different selections from amongst  the germinal elements. Mendelism, by the way, is especially concerned  to find out the law according to which the different types of  organization are distributed between the offspring. Each child,  meanwhile, is a unique individual, a living whole with an organization  of its very own. This means that its constituent elements form a system.  They stand to each other in relations of mutual support. In short,  life is possible because there is balance.    This general state of balance, however, is able to go along with a  lot of special balancings that seem largely independent of each other.  It is important to remember this when we come a little later on to  consider the instincts. All sorts of lesser systems prevail within  the larger system represented by the individual organism. It is just  as if within the state with its central government there were a number  of county councils, municipal corporations, and so on, each of them  enjoying a certain measure of self-government on its own account. Thus  we can see in a very general way how it is that so much variation is  possible. The selective organization, which from amongst the germinal  elements precipitates ever so many and different forms of fresh life,  is so loose and elastic that a working arrangement between the parts  can be reached in all sorts of directions. The lesser systems are so  far self-governing that they can be trusted to get along in almost  any combination; though of course some combinations are naturally  stronger and more stable than the rest, and hence tend to outlast them,  or, as the phrase goes, to be preserved by natural selection.    It is time to take account of the principle of natural selection. We  have done with the subject of variation. Whether use and disuse have  helped to shape the fresh forms of life, or whether these are purely  spontaneous combinations that have come into being on what we are  pleased to call their own account, at any rate let us take them as  given. What happens now? At this point begins the work of natural  selection. Darwin's great achievement was to formulate this law;  though it is only fair to add that it was discovered by A.R. Wallace  at the same moment. Both of them get the first hint of it from Malthus.  This English clergyman, writing about half a century earlier, had shown  that the growth of population is apt very considerably to outstrip  the development of food-supply; whereupon natural checks such as  famine or war must, he argued, ruthlessly intervene so as to redress  the balance. Applying these considerations to the plant and animal  kingdoms at large, Darwin and Wallace perceived that, of the  multitudinous forms of life thrust out upon the world to get a  livelihood as best they could, a vast quantity must be weeded out.  Moreover, since they vary exceedingly in their type of organization,  it seemed reasonable to suppose that, of the competitors, those who  were innately fitted to make the best of the ever-changing  circumstances would outlive the rest. An appeal to the facts fully  bore out this hypothesis. It must not, indeed, be thought that all  the weeding out which goes on favours the fittest. Accidents will  always happen. On the whole, however, the type that is most at home  under the surrounding conditions, it may be because it is more complex,  or it may be because it is of simpler organization, survives the rest.    Now to survive is to survive to breed. If you live to eighty, and have  no children, you do not survive in the biological sense; whereas your  neighbour who died at forty may survive in a numerous progeny. Natural  selection is always in the last resort between individuals; because  individuals are alone competent to breed. At the same time, the reason  for the individual's survival may lie very largely outside him. Amongst  the bees, for instance, a non-working type of insect survives to breed  because the sterile workers do their duty by the hive. So, too, that  other social animal, man, carries on the race by means of some whom  others die childless in order to preserve. Nevertheless, breeding  being a strictly individual and personal affair, there is always a  risk lest a society, through spending its best too freely, end by  recruiting its numbers from those in whom the engrained capacity to  render social service is weakly developed. To rear a goodly family  must always be the first duty of unselfish people; for otherwise the  spirit of unselfishness can hardly be kept alive the world.    Enough about heredity as a condition of evolution. We return, with  a better chance of distinguishing them, to the consideration of the  special effects that it brings about. It was said just now that heredity  is the stiffening in human nature, a stiffening bound up with a more  or less considerable offset of plasticity. Now clearly it is in some  sense true that the child's whole nature, its modicum of plasticity  included, is handed on from its parents. Our business in this chapter,  however, is on the whole to put out of our thoughts this plastic side  of the inherited life-force. The more or less rigid, definite,  systematized characters--these form the hereditary factor, the race.  Now none of these are ever quite fixed. A certain measure of plasticity  has to be counted in as part of their very nature. Even in the bee,  with its highly definite instincts, there is a certain flexibility  bound up with each of these; so that, for instance, the inborn faculty  of building up the comb regularly is modified if the hive happens to  be of an awkward shape. Yet, as compared with what remains over, the  characters that we are able to distinguish as racial must show fixity.  Unfortunately, habits show fixity too. Yet habits belong to the plastic  side of our nature; for, in forming a habit, we are plastic at the  start, though hardly so once we have let ourselves go. Habits, then,  must be discounted in our search for the hereditary bias in our lives.  It is no use trying to disguise the difficulties attending an inquiry  into race.           *       *       *       *       *    These difficulties notwithstanding, in the rest of this chapter let  us consider a few of what are usually taken to be racial features of  man. As before, the treatment must be illustrative; we cannot work  through the list. Further, we must be content with a very rough division  into bodily and mental features. Just at this point we shall find it  very hard to say what is to be reckoned bodily and what mental. Leaving  these niceties to the philosophers, however, let us go ahead as best  we can.    Oh for an external race-mark about which there could be no mistake!  That has always been a dream of the anthropologist; but it is a dream  that shows no signs of coming true. All sorts of tests of this kind  have been suggested. Cranium, cranial sutures, frontal process, nasal  bones, eye, chin, jaws, wisdom teeth, hair, humerus, pelvis, the  heart-line across the hand, calf, tibia, heel, colour, and even  smell--all these external signs, as well as many more, have been  thought, separately or together, to afford the crucial test of a man's  pedigree. Clearly I cannot here cross-examine the entire crowd of  claimants, were I even competent to do so. I shall, therefore, say  a few words about two, and two only, namely, head-form and colour.    I believe that, if the plain man were to ask himself how, in walking  down a London street, he distinguished one racial type from another,  he would find that he chiefly went by colour. In a general way he knows  how to make allowance for sunburn and get down to the native complexion  underneath. But, if he went off presently to a museum and tried to  apply his test to the pre-historic men on view there, it would fail  for the simple reason that long ago they left their skins behind them.  He would have to get to work, therefore, on their bony parts, and  doubtless would attack the skulls for choice. By considering head-form  and colour, then, we may help to cover a certain amount of the ground,  vast as it is. For remember that anthropology in this department draws  no line between ancient and modern, or between savage and civilized,  but tries to tackle every sort of man that comes within its reach.

Francis never let any occasion  pass of harassing the Emperor, but was always defeated. Charles once  actually invaded Provence, but was forced to retreat through the  devastation of the country before him by Montmorency, afterwards  Constable of France. Francis, by loud complaints, and by talking much of  his honour, contrived to make the world fancy him the injured man, while  he was really breaking oaths in a shameless manner. At last, in 1537,  the king and Emperor met at Aigues Mortes, and came to terms. Francis  married, as his second wife, Charles's sister Eleanor, and in 1540, when  Charles was in haste to quell a revolt in the Low Countries, he asked a  safe conduct through France, and was splendidly entertained at Paris.  Yet so low was the honour of the French, that Francis scarcely withstood  the temptation of extorting the duchy of Milan from him when in his  power, and gave so many broad hints that Charles was glad to be past the  frontier. The war was soon renewed. Francis set up a claim to Savoy, as  the key of Italy, allied himself with the Turks and Moors, and slaves  taken by them on the coasts of Italy and Spain were actually brought  into Marseilles. Nice was burnt; but the citadel held out, and as Henry  VIII. had allied himself with the Emperor, and had taken Boulogne,  Francis made a final peace at Crespy in 1545. He died only two years  later, in 1547.      7. Henry II.--His only surviving son, _Henry II._, followed the same  policy. The rise of Protestantism was now dividing the Empire in  Germany; and Henry took advantage of the strife which broke out between  Charles and the Protestant princes to attack the Emperor, and make  conquests across the German border. He called himself Protector of the  Liberties of the Germans, and leagued himself with them, seizing Metz,  which the Duke of Guise bravely defended when the Emperor tried to  retake it. This seizure of Metz was the first attempt of France to make  conquests in Germany, and the beginning of a contest between the French  and German peoples which has gone on to the present day. After the siege  a five years' truce was made, during which Charles V. resigned his  crowns. His brother had been already elected to the Empire, but his son  Philip II. became King of Spain and Naples, and also inherited the Low  Countries. The Pope, Paul IV., who was a Neapolitan, and hated the  Spanish rule, incited Henry, a vain, weak man, to break the truce and  send one army to Italy, under the Duke of Guise, while another attacked  the frontier of the Netherlands. Philip, assisted by the forces of his  wife, Mary I. of England, met this last attack with an army commanded by  the Duke of Savoy. It advanced into France, and besieged St. Quentin.  The French, under the Constable of Montmorency, came to relieve the  city, and were utterly defeated, the Constable himself being made  prisoner. His nephew, the Admiral de Coligny, held out St. Quentin to  the last, and thus gave the country time to rally against the invader;  and Guise was recalled in haste from Italy. He soon after surprised  Calais, which was thus restored to the French, after having been held  by the English for two hundred years. This was the only conquest the  French retained when the final peace of Cateau Cambresis was made in the  year 1558, for all else that had been taken on either side was then  restored. Savoy was given back to its duke, together with the hand of  Henry's sister, Margaret. During a tournament held in honour of the  wedding, Henry II. was mortally injured by the splinter of a lance, in  1559; and in the home troubles that followed, all pretensions to Italian  power were dropped by France, after wars which had lasted sixty-four  years.          CHAPTER V.    THE WARS OF RELIGION.      1. The Bourbons and Guises.--Henry II. had left four sons, the eldest  of whom, _Francis II._, was only fifteen years old; and the country was  divided by two great factions--one headed by the Guise family, an  offshoot of the house of Lorraine; the other by the Bourbons, who, being  descended in a direct male line from a younger son of St. Louis, were  the next heirs to the throne in case the house of Valois should become  extinct. Antony, the head of the Bourbon family, was called King of  Navarre, because of his marriage with Jeanne d'Albret, the queen, in her  own right, of this Pyrenean kingdom, which was in fact entirely in the  hands of the Spaniards, so that her only actual possession consisted of  the little French counties of Foix and Bearn. Antony himself was dull  and indolent, but his wife was a woman of much ability; and his brother,  Louis, Prince of Conde, was full of spirit and fire, and little  inclined to brook the ascendancy which the Duke of Guise and his  brothers enjoyed at court, partly in consequence of his exploit at  Calais, and partly from being uncle to the young Queen Mary of Scotland,  wife of Francis II. The Bourbons likewise headed the party among the  nobles who hoped to profit by the king's youth to recover the privileges  of which they had been gradually deprived, while the house of Guise were  ready to maintain the power of the crown, as long as that meant their  own power.      2. The Reformation.--The enmity of these two parties was much  increased by the reaction against the prevalent doctrines and the  corruptions of the clergy. This reaction had begun in the reign of  Francis I., when the Bible had been translated into French by two  students at the University of Paris, and the king's sister, Margaret,  Queen of Navarre, had encouraged the Reformers. Francis had leagued with  the German Protestants because they were foes to the Emperor, while he  persecuted the like opinions at home to satisfy the Pope. John Calvin, a  native of Picardy, the foremost French reformer, was invited to the free  city of Geneva, and there was made chief pastor, while the scheme of  theology called his \"Institutes\" became the text-book of the Reformed in  France, Scotland, and Holland. His doctrine was harsh and stern, aiming  at the utmost simplicity of worship, and denouncing the existing  practices so fiercely, that the people, who held themselves to have been  wilfully led astray by their clergy, committed such violence in the  churches that the Catholics loudly called for punishment on them. The  shameful lives of many of the clergy and the wickedness of the Court had  caused a strong reaction against them, and great numbers of both nobles  and burghers became Calvinists. They termed themselves Sacramentarians  or Reformers, but their nickname was Huguenots; probably from the Swiss,  \"_Eidgenossen_\" or oath comrades. Henry II., like his father, protected  German Lutherans and persecuted French Calvinists; but the lawyers of  the Parliament of Paris interposed, declaring that men ought not to be  burnt for heresy until a council of the Church should have condemned  their opinions, and it was in the midst of this dispute that Henry was  slain.      3. The Conspiracy of Amboise.--The Guise family were strong Catholics;  the Bourbons were the heads of the Huguenot party, chiefly from policy;  but Admiral Coligny and his brother, the Sieur D'Andelot, were sincere  and earnest Reformers. A third party, headed by the old Constable De  Montmorency, was Catholic in faith, but not unwilling to join with the  Huguenots in pulling down the Guises, and asserting the power of the  nobility. A conspiracy for seizing the person of the king and  destroying the Guises at the castle of Amboise was detected in time to  make it fruitless. The two Bourbon princes kept in the background,  though Conde was universally known to have been the true head and mover  in it, and he was actually brought to trial. The discovery only  strengthened the hands of Guise.      4. Regency of Catherine de' Medici.--Even then, however, Francis II.  was dying, and his brother, _Charles IX._, who succeeded him in 1560,  was but ten years old. The regency passed to his mother, the Florentine  Catherine, a wily, cat-like woman, who had always hitherto been kept in  the background, and whose chief desire was to keep things quiet by  playing off one party against the other. She at once released Conde, and  favoured the Bourbons and the Huguenots to keep down the Guises, even  permitting conferences to see whether the French Church could be  reformed so as to satisfy the Calvinists. Proposals were sent by Guise's  brother, the Cardinal of Lorraine, to the council then sitting at Trent,  for vernacular services, the marriage of the clergy, and other  alterations which might win back the Reformers. But an attack by the  followers of Guise on a meeting of Calvinists at Vassy, of whose ringing  of bells his mother had complained, led to the first bloodshed and the  outbreak of a civil war.      5. The Religious War.--To trace each stage of the war would be  impossible within these limits. It was a war often lulled for a short  time, and often breaking out again, and in which the actors grew more  and more cruel. The Reformed influence was in the south, the Catholic in  the east. Most of the provincial cities at first held with the Bourbons,  for the sake of civil and religious freedom; though the Guise family  succeeded to the popularity of the Burgundian dukes in Paris. Still  Catherine persuaded Antony of Bourbon to return to court just as his  wife, Queen Jeanne of Navarre, had become a staunch Calvinist, and while  dreaming of exchanging his claim on Navarre for the kingdom of Sardinia,  he was killed on the Catholic side while besieging Rouen. At the first  outbreak the Huguenots seemed to have by far the greatest influence. An  endeavour was made to seize the king's person, and this led to a battle  at Dreux. While it "]]]
