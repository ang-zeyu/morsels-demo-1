There are in this office two series of photographs representing the    ruin. The first series was taken in 1892 before the protective works    authorized by the Congress were commenced; the second series    represents the work in progress. In the recent examination the    present condition of the ruin was carefully compared with the    condition represented in the photographs.      On comparing the profiles of the walls, it was found that in many    cases the irregular upper surfaces retain the exact configuration of    1892, even to the slightest knobs and rain-formed crevices; the    correspondence being so close as to show that the injury and loss by    weathering during the interim has been imperceptible. In some other    cases, notably along the southern and eastern walls, the profiles    are more extensively modified; some of the points and knobs shown in    the photographs are gone, some of the old crevices are widened and    deepened, and some new crevices appear; and in some parts it can be    seen that walls are lowered several inches. On the whole the    modification of the profiles of the walls is limited, yet such as to    indicate that destruction is proceeding at a not inconsiderable    rate.      On comparing the scars and crevices on the sides of the walls, it    was found that, while many remain essentially unchanged, most are    enlarged and deepened. This is particularly noteworthy on the    eastern and southern walls, which are most beaten by wind-driven    rains, and which are also most modified in profile. It would appear    that destruction is proceeding more rapidly along the sides of the    walls than along the crests.      On examining the walls with respect to apparent solidity and    stability, it was found that nearly all are in fair or good    condition. The only portion that would seem in special danger is the    central section of the southern exterior wall. This section seems    insecure, and might at any time be overthrown by a heavy wind    following a rain storm. This section was not, unfortunately, braced    or tied to the stronger interior wall when the protective works were    carried out in 1892.      On examining the structure to ascertain the effect of the protective    works of 1892 in staying the destructive processes, particularly the    undermining of the walls by spattering rain and drifting sand, it    was found that in most cases the results have been excellent. On the    inner side of the middle section of the southern exterior wall    sapping is in progress at the ground level, and also along the rows    of joist openings for the first and second stories, and in a few    other places the protection seems inadequate; but in general the    anticipations of the projectors of the protective works seem to have    been realized.      The most serious of the destructive processes was sapping, and this    process has been nearly checked by the protective works. The second    was the desurfacing and subsequent eating away of the walls by    beating rains and frost, and this is still in progress at a moderate    rate. The least serious process was the wearing away of the crests    of the walls by rain and winds, and this is still going on at a    perceptible rate. It is impossible to determine, and difficult even    to approximate, the rate of destruction quantitatively, especially    so since it goes on cumulatively, with constantly increasing    rapidity, as the cemented surfaces are destroyed and the crevices    widen and deepen; but judging from the history of the ruin, and from    the rate of destruction indicated by comparing the photographs of    1892 with the present aspect, it would seem safe to conclude that,    if protected completely from vandalism, the ruin will be    comparatively little injured during the next five years, and will    stand perhaps half a century, without further protective works,    before moldering into dust.      In view of the slow yet ever increasing rate of destruction of the    ruin, and of its great interest as a tangible record of the    prehistoric inhabitants of this country, no hesitation is felt in    recommending that the structure be further protected, and    practically perpetuated, by a suitable roof, so designed as to    shield the walls from rain and sun and at the same time permit an    unobstructed view of the ruin from any direction.        *   *   *   *   *    I have the honor to be, sir, yours, with great respect,      J.

M. Poligny  thought he would watch the performance from the ghost's box... Well,  when Leopold cries, 'Let us fly!'--you know--and Eleazer stops them and  says, 'Whither go ye?' ... well, M. Poligny--I was watching him from  the back of the next box, which was empty--M. Poligny got up and walked  out quite stiffly, like a statue, and before I had time to ask him,  'Whither go ye?' like Eleazer, he was down the staircase, but without  breaking his leg.    \"Still, that doesn't let us know how the Opera ghost came to ask you  for a footstool,\" insisted M. Moncharmin.    \"Well, from that evening, no one tried to take the ghost's private box  from him.  The manager gave orders that he was to have it at each  performance.  And, whenever he came, he asked me for a footstool.\"    \"Tut, tut!  A ghost asking for a footstool!  Then this ghost of yours  is a woman?\"    \"No, the ghost is a man.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"He has a man's voice, oh, such a lovely man's voice!  This is what  happens:  When he comes to the opera, it's usually in the middle of the  first act.  He gives three little taps on the door of Box Five.  The  first time I heard those three taps, when I knew there was no one in  the box, you can think how puzzled I was!  I opened the door, listened,  looked; nobody!  And then I heard a voice say, 'Mme. Jules' my poor  husband's name was Jules--'a footstool, please.' Saving your presence,  gentlemen, it made me feel all-overish like.  But the voice went on,  'Don't be frightened, Mme. Jules, I'm the Opera ghost!'  And the voice  was so soft and kind that I hardly felt frightened.  THE VOICE WAS  SITTING IN THE CORNER CHAIR, ON THE RIGHT, IN THE FRONT ROW.\"    \"Was there any one in the box on the right of Box Five?\" asked  Moncharmin.    \"No; Box Seven, and Box Three, the one on the left, were both empty.  The curtain had only just gone up.\"    \"And what did you do?\"    \"Well, I brought the footstool.  Of course, it wasn't for himself he  wanted it, but for his lady!  But I never heard her nor saw her.\"    \"Eh?  What?  So now the ghost is married!\"  The eyes of the two  managers traveled from Mme. Giry to the inspector, who, standing behind  the box-keeper, was waving his arms to attract their attention.  He  tapped his forehead with a distressful forefinger, to convey his  opinion that the widow Jules Giry was most certainly mad, a piece of  pantomime which confirmed M. Richard in his determination to get rid of  an inspector who kept a lunatic in his service.  Meanwhile, the worthy  lady went on about her ghost, now painting his generosity:    \"At the end of the performance, he always gives me two francs,  sometimes five, sometimes even ten, when he has been many days without  coming.  Only, since people have begun to annoy him again, he gives me  nothing at all.    \"Excuse me, my good woman,\" said Moncharmin, while Mme. Giry tossed the  feathers in her dingy hat at this persistent familiarity, \"excuse me,  how does the ghost manage to give you your two francs?\"    \"Why, he leaves them on the little shelf in the box, of course.  I find  them with the program, which I always give him.  Some evenings, I find  flowers in the box, a rose that must have dropped from his lady's  bodice ... for he brings a lady with him sometimes; one day, they left  a fan behind them.\"    \"Oh, the ghost left a fan, did he?  And what did you do with it?\"    \"Well, I brought it back to the box next night.\"    Here the inspector's voice was raised.    \"You've broken the rules; I shall have to fine you, Mme. Giry.\"    \"Hold your tongue, you fool!\" muttered M. Firmin Richard.    \"You brought back the fan.  And then?\"    \"Well, then, they took it away with them, sir; it was not there at the  end of the performance; and in its place they left me a box of English  sweets, which I'm very fond of.  That's one of the ghost's pretty  thoughts.\"    \"That will do, Mme. Giry.  You can go.\"    When Mme. Giry had bowed herself out, with the dignity that never  deserted her, the manager told the inspector that they had decided to  dispense with that old madwoman's services; and, when he had gone in  his turn, they instructed the acting-manager to make up the inspector's  accounts.  Left alone, the managers told each other of the idea which  they both had in mind, which was that they should look into that little  matter of Box Five themselves.        Chapter V The Enchanted Violin      Christine Daae, owing to intrigues to which I will return later, did  not immediately continue her triumph at the Opera.  After the famous  gala night, she sang once at the Duchess de Zurich's; but this was the  last occasion on which she was heard in private.  She refused, without  plausible excuse, to appear at a charity concert to which she had  promised her assistance.  She acted throughout as though she were no  longer the mistress of her own destiny and as though she feared a fresh  triumph.    She knew that the Comte de Chagny, to please his brother, had done his  best on her behalf with M. Richard; and she wrote to thank him and also  to ask him to cease speaking in her favor.  Her reason for this curious  attitude was never known.  Some pretended that it was due to  overweening pride; others spoke of her heavenly modesty.  But people on  the stage are not so modest as all that; and I think that I shall not  be far from the truth if I ascribe her action simply to fear.  Yes, I  believe that Christine Daae was frightened by what had happened to her.  I have a letter of Christine's (it forms part of the Persian's  collection), relating to this period, which suggests a feeling of  absolute dismay:    \"I don't know myself when I sing,\" writes the poor child.    She showed herself nowhere; and the Vicomte de Chagny tried in vain to  meet her.  He wrote to her, asking to call upon her, but despaired of  receiving a reply when, one morning, she sent him the following note:    MONSIEUR:    I have not forgotten the little boy who went into the sea to rescue my  scarf.  I feel that I must write to you to-day, when I am going to  Perros, in fulfilment of a sacred duty.  To-morrow is the anniversary  of the death of my poor father, whom you knew and who was very fond of  you.  He is buried there, with his violin, in the graveyard of the  little church, at the bottom of the slope where we used to play as  children, beside the road where, when we were a little bigger, we said  good-by for the last time.    The Vicomte de Chagny hurriedly consulted a railway guide, dressed as  quickly as he could, wrote a few lines for his valet to take to his  brother and jumped into a cab which brought him to the Gare  Montparnasse just in time to miss the morning train.  He spent a dismal  day in town and did not recover his spirits until the evening, when he  was seated in his compartment in the Brittany express.  He read  Christine's note over and over again, smelling its perfume, recalling  the sweet pictures of his childhood, and spent the rest of that tedious  night journey in feverish dreams that began and ended with Christine  Daae.  Day was breaking when he alighted at Lannion.  He hurried to the  diligence for Perros-Guirec.  He was the only passenger.  He questioned  the driver and learned that, on the evening of the previous day, a  young lady who looked like a Parisian had gone to Perros and put up at  the inn known as the Setting Sun.    The nearer he drew to her, the more fondly he remembered the story of  the little Swedish singer.  Most of the details are still unknown to  the public.    There was once, in a little market-town not far from Upsala, a peasant  who lived there with his family, digging the earth during the week and  singing in the choir on Sundays.  This peasant had a little daughter to  whom he taught the musical alphabet before she knew how to read.  Daae's father was a great musician, perhaps without knowing it.  Not a  fiddler throughout the length and breadth of Scandinavia played as he  did.  His reputation was widespread and he was always invited to set  the couples dancing at weddings and other festivals.  His wife died  when Christine was entering upon her sixth year.  Then the father, who  cared only for his daughter and his music, sold his patch of ground and  went to Upsala in search of fame and fortune.  He found nothing but  poverty.    He returned to the country, wandering from fair to fair, strumming his  Scandinavian melodies, while his child, who never left his side,  listened to him in ecstasy or sang to his playing.  One day, at Ljimby  Fair, Professor Valerius heard them and took them to Gothenburg.  He  maintained that the father was the first violinist in the world and  that the daughter had the making of a great artist.  Her education and  instruction were provided for.  She made rapid progress and charmed  everybody with her prettiness, her grace of manner and her genuine  eagerness to please.    When Valerius and his wife went to settle in France, they took Daae and  Christine with them.  \"Mamma\" Valerius treated Christine as her  daughter.  As for Daae, he began to pine away with homesickness.  He  never went out of doors in Paris, but lived in a sort of dream which he  kept up with his violin.  For hours at a time, he remained locked up in  his bedroom with his daughter, fiddling and singing, very, very softly.  Sometimes Mamma Valerius would come and listen behind the door, wipe  away a tear and go down-stairs again on tiptoe, sighing for her  Scandinavian skies.    Daae seemed not to recover his strength until the summer, when the  whole family went to stay at Perros-Guirec, in a far-away corner of  Brittany, where the sea was of the same color as in his own country.  Often he would play his saddest tunes on the beach and pretend that the  sea stopped its roaring to listen to them.  And then he induced Mamma  Valerius to indulge a queer whim of his.
