The  tomb was also damaged by this foolish opening.    [Illustration: BRASS OF AETHELRED.]    Three small carved figures at the bottom of the hood moulding of the  arches over these monuments deserve attention. The one on the west  side of the southern arch represents Moses with the tables of the law.  Probably there was another such figure at the eastern end of the same  moulding, but this would have been cut away when the sedilia were  inserted. The opposite arch has a figure on each side.    Just at the east end of the Courtenay tomb is a slab of Purbeck marble,  reputed to have once covered the grave of AEthelred. In it is inserted a  fifteenth-century brass, with a rectangular plate of copper bearing an  inscription, represented in the illustration (p. 46). A brass plate with  a similar inscription, though the date on it is given as 872, was found  in the library. Possibly the original brass and inscription were taken  up in the time of the civil wars and hidden for safety, and the  inscription having been lost, the copper plate now on the tomb was made  when the brass was replaced, and the original plate was afterwards found  and was placed for safety in what is now the library. _Copper_ nails  were used to fasten the brass to the floor, which perhaps serves to show  that the engraved _copper_ plate was made at the time when the brass was  replaced on the slab. A little piece of the left-hand bottom corner has  been broken off, and the top of the sceptre is missing. There are no  rails before the altar, but their place is supplied by three oak benches  covered with white linen cloths (these may be seen in the illustration  on p. 43). The use of the \"houseling linen\" dates back to very early  times. The word \"housel\" for the sacrament of the Lord's Supper has gone  out of use, though most of us are familiar with the line      \"_Unhouseled_, unanointed, unanelled,\"    in which the ghost of Hamlet's father describes the circumstances of his  death. The word \"unhouseled\" in this means that he died without  receiving the sacred elements before his death.    The benches are a relic of Puritan times: there is an entry dated 1656  in the churchwardens' accounts respecting the payment of L1 \"for making  and setting up the benches about ye communion table in the quire.\" These  were at first used as seats, on which the communicants sat to receive  the bread and wine. In after times their use was modified. These  benches, ten in number, were placed on the steps leading up to the  altar, and it was customary for the clerk on \"Sacrament Sundays\" to go  to the lectern after morning prayer, and, in a loud voice, give notice  thus: \"All ye who are prepared to receive the Holy Communion draw near.\"  Those who wished to communicate then went into the chancel and sat on  these benches or in the choir stalls, waiting their turns, and kneeling  on mats until the clergy brought them the bread and wine. Up to 1852  there was a rail on the top step, at the entrance of the presbytery,  on which the houseling linen hung. The rail, which was of no great  antiquity, was removed at that date, and three of the oak benches  were retained to supply its place; these are now used as an ordinary  communion rail, but are always covered with the \"fair white cloths.\"    The #South Choir Aisle#, known as the Trinity Aisle, has at its east  end a five-light window, each light of which runs up through the  head; the south wall is pierced by two three-light windows of similar  character. The wall opposite in the western bay, against which the organ  now stands, is blank, as on the outside of this the vestry stands with  the library above it. At the east end of this aisle was the chantry  founded by the Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, whose father and  mother lie in the tomb already described beneath the nearest arch on the  north side of this aisle. The altar of this chantry, as well as all the  other altars in the church, numbering ten in all, have been swept away,  no doubt at the time of the Reformation. But recently the east end of  this aisle has been fitted up with a communion table for use at early  services.    In this aisle is to be seen, under the second window from the east,  the marble or slate painted sarcophagus known as the Etricke tomb.  Anthony Etricke of Holt Lodge, Recorder of Poole, was the magistrate  who committed for trial the ill-fated Duke of Monmouth, who, after  his flight from Sedgemoor, was captured in the north of Dorset near  Critchell. It is said that in his old age he became very eccentric, and  desired to be buried neither in the church nor out of it, neither above  ground nor under; and to carry out his wish he got permission to cut a  niche in the church wall, partly below the level of the ground outside,  and then firmly fixed in it the slate receptacle which is now to be  seen. Into this he ordered that his coffin should be put when he died.  Moreover, he had a presentiment that he should die in 1691, and so  placed that date upon the side of the sarcophagus. He, however, lived  twelve years longer than he expected, so that when his death really  occurred the date had to be altered to 1703. The two dates, the later  written over the earlier, are still to be seen. On the outside of the  sarcophagus are painted the arms of his family. The whole is kept in  good repair, for so determined was the good man that his memory should  be kept alive, and his last resting-place well cared for, that he gave  to the church in perpetuity the sum of 20s. per annum, to be expended in  keeping the niche and coffin in good order. When the church was restored  in 1857 the outer coffin was opened, and it was found that the inner one  had decayed, but that the dust and bones were still to be seen, these  were placed in a new chest and once more deposited in the outer coffin.    [Illustration: THE ETRICKE TOMB.]    In this aisle is also to be seen an ancient chest, not formed as chests  usually are, of wooden planks or slabs fastened together, but hewn out  of a solid trunk of oak. The chest is over 6 feet long, but the cavity  inside is not more than 22 inches in length, 9 inches in width, and 6  inches in depth, hence it will be seen how thick and massive the walls  are. Originally it may have contained some small relics, and probably is  much older than the present minster itself. It was afterwards used as a  safe for deeds. In 1735 some deeds were taken from it bearing the date  1200.    Formerly, there stood on this aisle the tomb of John de Berwick, dean of  the college, who died in 1312. At his tomb once a year the parishioners  met to receive the accounts of the outgoing churchwardens and to elect  new ones. The altar tomb was removed about 1790, the slab at the top of  it being let into the floor.    [Illustration: ANCIENT CHEST.]    The #North Choir Aisle# is a foot narrower than the corresponding south  aisle: it has three windows each with two lights instead of two of three  lights. This is known as St George's aisle. In the east wall is a  piscina of Perpendicular date. Two doors lead into this aisle--one at  the corner, where the walls of the aisle and transept meet, and one  between the two easternmost windows. The principal objects in this aisle  are two bulky chests, one containing the title-deeds of some charity  lands in the parish of Corfe Castle. This is fastened by six locks, each  of different pattern,--each trustee of the charity has a key, of his own  special lock,--so that the chest can only be opened by the consent of  the whole body. The other chest contains the parochial accounts; this  once had six locks, but now has only two.    In the south-eastern corner of this aisle lies a mutilated effigy of a  mail-clad knight with crossed legs. This is said to have been removed to  the minster from another church when it was destroyed. Whom it represents  is uncertain, but traditionally it is known as the Fitz Piers monument.    [Illustration: UVEDALE MONUMENT.]    In this aisle is the monument of Sir Edmund Uvedale, who died in 1606.  The monument was erected by his widow in \"dolefull duety.\" It is in the  Renaissance style, and was carved by an Italian sculptor. The old knight  is represented clad in a complete suit of plate armour, though without a  helmet. He lies on his right side, his head is raised a little from his  right hand, on which it has been resting, as though he were just awaking  from his long sleep, his left hand holds his gauntlet. Above the tomb  hangs an iron helmet, such as was worn in Elizabethan times, and which  very probably was once worn by Sir Edmund himself.    Between the eastern ends of the choir aisles, and beneath the eastern  end of the presbytery, is the #Crypt#. This is a vaulted chamber, the  vaulting being supported on two pairs of pillars, thus forming three  aisles, as it were, running east and west, each containing three bays.  The western bay is of somewhat later date than the central and eastern;  the wall against which the westernmost of the pillars once stood was  removed, but the piers were allowed to remain, backed up by a new piece  of masonry built against them to support the new vaulting. The crypt  is lighted by four windows, equal-sided spherical triangles in shape;  two look out eastward, one northward beyond the chancel arch, one,  correspondingly placed, to the southward. The centre of the east end is  a blank wall. Against this the altar stood--a niche, probably a piscina,  still may be seen. On each side of the place where the altar stood there  are two openings into the choir aisles. The exteriors of these are of  the same form and size as the crypt windows, but they are deeply splayed  inside, and probably were used as hagioscopes or squints, to allow those  kneeling in the choir aisles to see the priest celebrating mass at the  crypt altar.

From that palace lofty terrace--her the mother of the king      Saw, and thus her nurse addressed she--\"Go, and lead that wanderer in!      Sad she roves, without a refuge--troubled by those gazing men;      Yet in form so bright, irradiate--is our palace where she moves.      Though so maniac-like, half-clothed--like Heaven's long-eyed queen she          seems.\"      She those crowding men dispersing--quickly to the palace top      Made her mount--and in amazement--her the mother-queen addressed:      \"Thus though bowed and worn with sorrow--such a shining form thou wear'st,      As through murky clouds the lightning--tell me who thou art and whence:      For thy form is more than human--of all ornament despoiled:      Men thou fear'st not, unattended--in celestial beauty safe.\"        Hearing thus her gentle language--Bhima's daughter made reply,      \"Know me like thyself a mortal--a distressed, devoted wife;      Of illustrious race an handmaid--making where I will mine home;      On the roots and wild-fruits feeding--lonely, at the fall of eve.      Gifted with unnumber'd virtues--is my true, my faithful lord,      And I still the hero followed--like his shadow on the way.      'Twas his fate, with desp'rate fondness--to pursue the love of play,      And in play subdued and ruined--entered he yon lonely wood;      Him, arrayed in but one garment,--like a madman wandering wild,      To console my noble husband--I too entered the deep wood;      He within that dreary forest--for some cause, to me unknown,      Wild with hunger, reft of reason--that one single robe he lost.      I with but one robe, him naked[99]--frantic, and with mind diseased,      Following through the boundless forest--many a night I had not slept;      Then, when I had sunk to slumber--me the blameless leaving there,      Half my garment having severed--he his sinless consort fled;      Seeking him, my outcast husband--night and day am I consumed:      Him I see not, ever shining--like the lotus cup, beloved;      Find him not, most like th' immortals--lord of all, my life, my soul.\"        Even as thus, with eyes o'erflowing--uttered she her sad lament,      Sad herself, sad Bhima's daughter--did the mother queen address:      \"Dwell with me, then, noble Lady--deep the joy in thee I feel,      And the servants of my household--shall thy royal husband seek;      Haply hither he may wander--as he roams about the world:      Dwelling here in peace and honour--thou thy husband wilt rejoin.\"        To the king of Chedi's mother--Damayanti made reply;      \"On these terms, O nurse of heroes!--I with thee may make abode:      That I eat not broken victuals[100]--wash not feet with menial hand:[101]      Nor with stranger men have converse--in my chaste, secluded state;      If that any man demand me--be he punished; if again,      Be he put to death on th' instant--this the vow that I have sworn.      Only, if they seek my husband--holy Brahmins will I see.      Be my terms by thee accepted--gladly will I sojourn here,      But on other terms no sojourn--will this heart resolved admit.\"        Then to her with joyful spirit--spake the mother of the king:      \"As thou wilt shall all be ordered--be thou blest, since such thy vow.\"      Speaking thus to Bhima's daughter--did the royal mother then,      In these words address her daughter--young Sunanda was her name:      \"See this handmaid, my Sunanda--gifted with a form divine;      She in age thy lovely compeer--be she to thee as a friend;      Joined with her in sweet communion--take thy pleasure without fear.\"      Young Sunanda, all rejoicing--to her own abode went back,      Taking with her Damayanti--circled with her virgin peers.          BOOK XIV.          Damayanti when deserting--royal Nala fled, ere long      Blazing in the forest jungle--he a mighty fire beheld;      Thence as of a living being--from the midst a voice he heard:      \"Hasten, Nala!\" oft and loudly--\"Punyasloka, haste,\" it cried.      \"Fear thou not,\" king Nala answered--plunging in the ruddy flame;      There he saw the king of serpents--lying, coiled into a ring.      There with folded hands the serpent--trembling, thus to Nala spake:      \"Me, Karkotaka, the Serpent--know, thou sovereign of men;      Narada, the famous hermit[102]--I deceived, the holy sage;      He in righteous indignation--smote me with this awful curse:      Stay thou there as one unmoving--till king Nala passing by,      Lead thee hence; save only Nala--none can free thee from this curse.      Through this potent execration--I no step have power to move;      I the way to bliss will show thee--if thou sav'st me from this fate.      I will show thee noble friendship--serpent none is like to me;      Lightly shall I weigh, uplift me--in thy hand, with speed, O king.\"      Thus when spake the king of serpents--to a finger's size he shrank;      Him when Nala lightly lifted--to the unburning space he passed.      To the air all cool and temperate--brought him, by the flame unreached.      As he fain on th' earth would place him--thus Karkotaka began.      \"Move thou now, O king, and slowly--as thou movest, count thy steps.      Then the best of all good fortune--will I give thee, mighty armed!\"      Ere the tenth step he had counted[103]--him the sudden serpent bit:      As he bit him, on the instant--all his kingly form was changed.      There he stood, and gazed in wonder--Nala, on his altered form.      In his proper shape the serpent--saw the sovereign of men.      Then Karkotaka the serpent--thus to Nala comfort spake:      \"Through my power thy form is altered--lest thou should'st be known of men.      He through whom thou'rt thus afflicted--Nala, with intensest grief,      Through my poison, shall in anguish--ever dwell within thy soul.      All his body steeped in poison--till he free thee from thy woe,      Shall he dwell within thee prison'd--in the ecstacy of pain.      So from him, by whom, thou blameless!--sufferest such unworthy wrong,      By the curse I lay upon him--my deliverance shall be wrought.      Fear not thou the tusked wild boar--foeman fear not thou, O king,      Neither Brahmin fear, nor Sages[104]--safe through my prevailing power.      King, this salutary poison--gives to thee nor grief nor pain;      In the battle, chief of Rajas--victory is ever thine.      Go thou forth, thyself thus naming--Vahuca, the charioteer,      To the royal Rituparna--in the dice all-skilful he;      To Ayodhya's pleasant city--sovereign of Nishadha! go;      He his skill in dice will give thee--for thy skill in taming steeds:      Of Ikshwaku's noble lineage--he will be thy best of friends.      Thou the skill in dice possessing--soon wilt rise again to bliss;      With thy consort reunited--yield not up thy soul to grief.      Thou thy kingdom, thou thy children--wilt regain, the truth I speak.      When again thou would'st behold thee--in thy proper form, O king,      Summon me to thy remembrance--and this garment put thou on:      In this garment clad resum'st thou--instantly thy proper form.\"      Saying thus, of vests celestial--gave he to the king a pair.[105]      And king Nala, thus instructed--gifted with these magic robes,      Instantly the king of serpents--vanished from his sight away.          BOOK XV.          Vanished thus the King of Serpents--set Nishadha's raja forth,      Rituparna's royal city--on the tenth day entered he.      Straight before the royal presence--\"Vahuca am I,\" he said,      \"In the skill of taming horses--on the earth is not my peer;      Use me, where the difficult counsel--where thou want'st the dexterous hand;      In the art of dressing viands[106]--I am skilful above all.      Whatsoe'er the art, whatever--be most difficult to do,      I will strive to execute it--take me to thy service, king.\"        RITUPARNA _spake_.        \"Vahuca, I bid thee welcome--all this service shalt thou do,      On my horses' rapid motion--deeply is my mind engaged.      Take thou then on thee the office--that my steeds be fleet of foot,      Of my horse be thou the master--hundred hundreds is thy pay:[107]      Ever shalt thou have for comrades--Varshneya and Jivala:      With these two pursue thy pleasure--Vahuca, abide with me.\"      Thus addressed, did Nala, honoured--by king Rituparna long,      With Varshneya in that city--and with Jivala abide:      There abode he, sadly thinking--of Vidarbha's daughter still.      In the evening, every evening--uttered he this single verse;      \"Where is she, by thirst and hunger--worn, and weary, pious still,      Thinking of her unwise husband--in whose presence is she now!\"      Thus the raja, ever speaking--Jivala one night addressed;      \"Who is she, for whom thou grievest?--Vahuca, I fain would hear.\"      [108]Answered thus the royal Nala--\"To a man of sense bereft,      Once belonged a peerless lady--most infirm of word was he;      From some cause from her dissevered--went that frantic man away,      In his foolish soul thus parted--wanders he, by sorrow racked;      Night and day, and still for ever--by his parching grief consumed:      Nightly brooding o'er his sorrows--sings he this sad single verse.      O'er the whole wide earth a wanderer--chance-alighting in some place,      Dwells that woful man, unworthy,--ever wakeful with his grief.      Him that noble lady following--in the forest lone and dread,      Lives, of that bad man forsaken--hard it is to say, she lives!      Lone, and young, the ways unknowing--undeserving of such fate,      Pines she there with thirst and hunger--hard it is to say, she lives.      In that vast and awful forest--haunted by fierce beasts of prey,      By her lord she roams forsaken--hapless, by that luckless lord.\"      Thus remembering Damayanti--did Nishadha's king unknown,      Long within that "]]]
