These things are necessary if  Christianity is to assume lordship over a soil on which some  aphrodisiacal or Adonis cult has already established a notion as to what  a cult ought to be. To insist upon _chastity_ greatly strengthens the  vehemence and subjectivity of the religious instinct--it makes the cult  warmer, more enthusiastic, more soulful.--Love is the state in which man  sees things most decidedly as they are _not_. The force of illusion  reaches its highest here, and so does the capacity for sweetening, for  _transfiguring_. When a man is in love he endures more than at any other  time; he submits to anything. The problem was to devise a religion which  would allow one to love: by this means the worst that life has to offer  is overcome--it is scarcely even noticed.--So much for the three  Christian virtues: faith, hope and charity: I call them the three  Christian _ingenuities_.--Buddhism is in too late a stage of  development, too full of positivism, to be shrewd in any such way.--    [3] That is, in Pandora's box.      24.    Here I barely touch upon the problem of the _origin_ of Christianity.  The _first_ thing necessary to its solution is this: that Christianity  is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprung--it  is _not_ a reaction against Jewish instincts; it is their inevitable  product; it is simply one more step in the awe-inspiring logic of the  Jews. In the words of the Saviour, \"salvation is of the Jews.\"[4]--The  _second_ thing to remember is this: that the psychological type of the  Galilean is still to be recognized, but it was only in its most  degenerate form (which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign  features) that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used:  as a type of the _Saviour_ of mankind.--    [4] John iv, 22.    The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for  when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they  chose, with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be _at any price_: this  price involved a radical _falsification_ of all nature, of all  naturalness, of all reality, of the whole inner world, as well as of  the outer. They put themselves _against_ all those conditions under  which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even been  _permitted_ to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood  in direct opposition to _natural_ conditions--one by one they distorted  religion, civilization, morality, history and psychology until each  became a _contradiction_ of its _natural significance_. We meet with the  same phenomenon later on, in an incalculably exaggerated form, but only  as a copy: the Christian church, put beside the \"people of God,\" shows a  complete lack of any claim to originality. Precisely for this reason the  Jews are the most _fateful_ people in the history of the world: their  influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that  today the Christian can cherish anti-Semitism without realizing that it  is no more than the _final consequence of Judaism_.    In my \"Genealogy of Morals\" I give the first psychological explanation  of the concepts underlying those two antithetical things, a _noble_  morality and a _ressentiment_ morality, the second of which is a mere  product of the denial of the former. The Judaeo-Christian moral system  belongs to the second division, and in every detail. In order to be able  to say Nay to everything representing an _ascending_ evolution of  life--that is, to well-being, to power, to beauty, to self-approval--the  instincts of _ressentiment_, here become downright genius, had to invent  an _other_ world in which the _acceptance of life_ appeared as the most  evil and abominable thing imaginable. Psychologically, the Jews are a  people gifted with the very strongest vitality, so much so that when  they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose  voluntarily, and with a profound talent for self-preservation, the side  of all those instincts which make for _decadence_--_not_ as if mastered  by them, but as if detecting in them a power by which \"the world\" could  be _defied_. The Jews are the very opposite of _decadents_: they have  simply been forced into _appearing_ in that guise, and with a degree of  skill approaching the _non plus ultra_ of histrionic genius they have  managed to put themselves at the head of all _decadent_ movements (--for  example, the Christianity of Paul--), and so make of them something  stronger than any party frankly saying _Yes_ to life. To the sort of  men who reach out for power under Judaism and Christianity,--that is to  say, to the _priestly_ class--_decadence_ is no more than a means to an  end. Men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind sick, and  in confusing the values of \"good\" and \"bad,\" \"true\" and \"false\" in a  manner that is not only dangerous to life, but also slanders it.      25.    The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt  to _denaturize_ all natural values: I point to five facts which bear  this out. Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel  maintained the _right_ attitude of things, which is to say, the natural  attitude. Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power,  its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for  victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them  whatever was necessary to their existence--above all, rain. Jahveh is  the god of Israel, and _consequently_ the god of justice: this is the  logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in  the use of it. In the religious ceremonial of the Jews both aspects of  this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high  destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the  benign procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its  herds and its crops.--This view of things remained an ideal for a long  while, even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows:  anarchy within and the Assyrian without. But the people still retained,  as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who  was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge--a vision best  visualized in the typical prophet (_i. e._, critic and satirist of the  moment), Isaiah.--But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old god no  longer _could_ do what he used to do. He ought to have been abandoned.  But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him was  _changed_--the conception of him was _denaturized_; this was the price  that had to be paid for keeping him.--Jahveh, the god of \"justice\"--he  is in accord with Israel _no more_, he no longer vizualizes the national  egoism; he is now a god only conditionally.... The public notion of this  god now becomes merely a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who  interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment  for obedience or disobedience to him, for \"sin\": that most fraudulent of  all imaginable interpretations, whereby a \"moral order of the world\" is  set up, and the fundamental concepts, \"cause\" and \"effect,\" are stood on  their heads. Once natural causation has been swept out of the world by  doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of _un_-natural causation  becomes necessary: and all other varieties of the denial of nature  follow it. A god who _demands_--in place of a god who helps, who gives  counsel, who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of  courage and self-reliance.... _Morality_ is no longer a reflection of  the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the  people; it is no longer the primary life-instinct; instead it has become  abstract and in opposition to life--a fundamental perversion of the  fancy, an \"evil eye\" on all things. _What_ is Jewish, _what_ is  Christian morality? Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted  with the idea of \"sin\"; well-being represented as a danger, as a  \"temptation\"; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of  conscience....      26.    The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;--but  even here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel  ceased to be of any value: out with it!--These priests accomplished that  miracle of falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the  documentary evidence; with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the  face of all tradition and all historical reality, they translated the  past of their people into _religious_ terms, which is to say, they  converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation, whereby all  offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was  rewarded. We would regard this act of historical falsification as  something far more shameful if familiarity with the _ecclesiastical_  interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our  inclinations for uprightness _in historicis_. And the philosophers  support the church: the _lie_ about a \"moral order of the world\" runs  through the whole of philosophy, even the newest. What is the meaning  of a \"moral order of the world\"? That there is a thing called the will  of God which, once and for all time, determines what man ought to do and  what he ought not to do; that the worth of a people, or of an individual  thereof, is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this  will of God; that the destinies of a people or of an individual are  _controlled_ by this will of God, which rewards or punishes according to  the degree of obedience manifested.--In place of all that pitiable lie  _reality_ has this to say: the _priest_, a parasitical variety of man  who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life, takes the  name of God in vain: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#9)"],[1,"blankets; the fire which had burned through  the previous ceremonies was first removed and all traces of it covered  with sand. As the artists were to begin the painting with the center of  the picture only a portion of the ground color was laid at first, in order  to enable them to work with greater facility. While the ground color was  being laid a man sat on one side of the lodge grinding with a metate and  mixing the colors. A quantity of coals were taken from the exhausted fire  from which to prepare black paint. A small quantity of red sand was mixed  with the charcoal to give it body or weight. The colors used in this sand  painting have all been referred to in the description of the rainbow over  the sweat house. After the central portion of the ground work for the  painting was smoothed off a Jerusalem cross was drawn in black. The eye  usually was the only guide for drawing lines, though on two occasions a  weaving stick was used. As a rule four artists were employed, one  beginning at each point of the cross. Each arm of the cross was completed  by the artist who began the work. For illustration of painting see PL  CXXI.    The black cross-bars in the illustration denote pine logs; the white lines  the froth of the water; the yellow, vegetable debris gathered by the logs;  the blue and red lines, sunbeams. The blue spot in center of cross denotes  water. There are four Hostjobokon with their wives the Hostjoboard; each  couple sit upon one of the cross arms of the logs. These gods carry in  their right hands a rattle, and in their left sprigs of pinon; the wives  or goddesses carry pinon sprigs in both hands; the rattle brings male  rains, and the pinon, carried by the women, female rains; these rains meet  upon the earth, conceive and bring forth all vegetation. Their heads are  ornamented with eagle plumes tied on with cotton cord. (Note: In all cases  the round head denotes male and octangular head female.) The gods have  also a bunch of night-owl feathers and eagle plumes on the left side of  the head; both male and female wear turquois earrings and necklaces of the  same. The larynx is represented by the parallel lines across the blue. A  line of sunlight encircles the head of both males and females. The white  spots on the side of the females' heads represent the ears. The arms of  the goddesses are covered with corn pollen, and long ribbons of fox skins  are attached to the wrists, as shown on painting number one. All wear  beaded moccasins tied on with cotton cord. Their chins are covered with  corn pollen and red sunlight surrounds the body. The skirts only have an  additional line of blue sunlight. Hasjelti is to the east of the painting.  He carries a squirrel skin filled with tobacco. His shirt is white cotton  and very elastic. The leggings are of white deer skin fringed, and the  moccasins are similar to the others. His head is ornamented with an  eagle's tail, and to the tip of each plume there is a fluffy feather from  the breast of the eagle. A bunch of night-owl feathers is on either side  of the eagle tail where it is attached to the head. The horizontal and  perpendicular lines on the face were referred to in the description of the  first sand painting. The projection on the right of the throat is a fox  skin. Hostjoghon's headdress is similar to that of Hasjelti's. Two strips  of beaver skin tipped with six quills of the porcupine are attached to the  right of the throat. The four colored stars on the body are ornaments of  beads. The shirt of this god is invisible; the dark is the dark of the  body. Hostjoghon carries a staff colored black from a charred plant. The  Navajo paint their bodies with the same plant. The top of the staff is  ornamented with a turkey's tail tied to the staff with white cotton cord;  eagle and turkey plumes are alternately attached to the staff with a cord.    The Naaskiddi are to the north and south of the painting; they carry  staffs of lightning ornamented with eagle plumes and sunbeams. Their  bodies are nude except the loin skirt; their leggings and moccasins are  the same as the others. The hunch upon the back is a black cloud, and the  three groups of white lines denote corn and other seeds of vegetation.  Five eagle plumes are attached to the cloud backs (eagles live with the  clouds); the body is surrounded with sunlight; the lines of red and blue  which border the bunch upon the back denote sunbeams penetrating storm  clouds. The black circle zigzagged with white around the head is a cloud  basket filled with corn and seeds of grass. On either side of the head are  five feathers of the red shafted flicker (_Colaptes cafer_); a fox skin is  attached to the right side of the throat; the mountain sheep horns are  tipped with the under tail feathers of the eagle, tied on with cotton  cord. The horns are filled with clouds. The rainbow goddess, upon which  these gods often travel, completes the picture.                                  [Illustration]      Upon completion of the painting the song-priest, who stood to the east of  it holding in his hand a bag of sacred meal, stepped carefully between the  figures, sprinkling pollen upon the feet and heart of each. He then  sprinkled a thread of pollen up each cheek and down the middle of the face  of the figures, afterwards extending his right hand toward the east. The  face of the encircling rainbow goddess was also sprinkled. The song-priest  placed the sacred wands around the rainbow, commencing on the west side of  the painting, and repeated a prayer, pointing his finger to the head of  each figure. He also placed a small gourd of medicine water in the hands  of the rainbow goddess and laid a small cedar twig on the gourd. The  invalid upon entering the lodge was handed an Apache basket containing  sacred meal, which he sprinkled over the painting and placed the basket  near the feet of the rainbow goddesses; the song-priest and choir sang to  the accompaniment of the rattle. A short time after the entrance of the  invalid Hasjelti appeared, and taking the evergreen from the gourd dipped  it into the medicine water and sprinkled the feet, heart, and heads of the  sand figures, after which the invalid sat in the center of the cross.  Hasjelti gave him a sip of the sacred water from the gourd and returned  the gourd to its place; then he touched the feet, heart, and head of each  figure successively with his right hand, each time touching the  corresponding parts of the body of the invalid. Every time Hasjelti  touched the invalid he gave a weird hoot. After he had been touched with  sands from all the paintings the theurgist, selecting a few live coals  from a small fire which had been kept burning near the door, threw them in  front of the invalid, who still retained his seat in the center of the  painting. The theurgist placed herbs, which he took from a buckskin bag,  on the coals from which a very pleasant aroma arose. An attendant  sprinkled water on the coals and a moment after threw them out of the fire  opening. The song-priest gathered the wands from around the edge of the  painting and four attendants began to erase it by scraping the sands from  the cardinal points to the center. Again the people hurried to take sand  from the hearts, heads, and limbs of the figures to rub upon themselves.  The sands were gathered into a blanket and deposited at the base of a  pinon tree about one hundred yards north of the lodge. A chant closed the  ceremony.            SEVENTH DAY.      The first business of the day was the preparation of an elaborate sand  picture, and though the artists worked industriously from dawn, it was not  completed until after 3 o'clock. The paint grinder was kept busy to supply  the artists. It was observed that in drawing some of the lines the artists  used a string of stretched yarn instead of the weaving stick. When five of  the figures had been completed, six young men came into the lodge, removed  their clothes, and whitened their bodies and limbs with kaolin; they then  left the lodge to solicit food from the people, who were now quite thickly  gathered over the mesa to witness the closing ceremonies. The mesa top for  a mile around was crowded with Indians, horses, sheep, and hogans  (lodges); groups of 3 to 20 Indians could be seen here and there gambling,  while foot and horse racing were features of special interest. Indeed, the  people generally were enjoying themselves at the expense of the invalid.  The rainbow goddess, Nattsilit, surrounding the painting, was about 25  feet in length. Upon the completion of the painting the song-priest  sprinkled the figures with pollen as before described and planted the  feather wands around the pictures.    In the illustration of this painting, Pl. CXXIII, Hasjelti will be  recognized as the leader. He carries a fawn skin filled with sacred meal;  the spots on the skin are seven and in the form of a great bear. The fawn  skin indicates him as the chief of all game. It was Hasjelti who created  game. The first six figures following Hasjelti are the Ethsethle. The next  six figures are their wives. Toneennili, the water sprinkler (_to_, water,  and _yonily_, to sprinkle), follows carrying a water jug, from which he  sprinkles the earth. The Ethsethle wear leggings of corn pollen and the  forearms of the gods are covered with pollen. Their wives have their arms  and bodies covered with the same. The skirts of the Ethsethle are  elaborately ornamented and their pouches at their sides are decorated with  many beads, feathers, and fringes. The gods are walking upon black clouds  and mist (the yellow denoting mist), the women upon blue clouds and mist.    During the ceremony an Apache basket containing meal was brought in and  placed at the feet of the rainbow goddess. The invalid entered the lodge,  which had become quite filled with privileged spectators, and receiving  the basket of meal, sprinkled the figures from left"]]]
