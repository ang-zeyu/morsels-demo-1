The economy, and especially  the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects  of Hurricane Luis in September but recovered in 1996. Anguillan  officials have put substantial effort into developing the offshore  financing sector. A comprehensive package of financial services  legislation was enacted in late 1994. In the medium term, prospects  for the economy will depend on the tourism sector and, therefore, on  continuing income growth in the industrialized nations.
