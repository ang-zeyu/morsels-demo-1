The next step is to reduce the student's theoretical knowledge to  practice, in a department devoted to actual business operations. This  business or finishing department is shown at the upper left corner of  our front page illustration. The work in this department is as exacting  and as real as the work in the best business houses and banks. At the  extreme end of the room is a bank in complete operation, as perfect in  its functions as any bank in this city or elsewhere. The records made in  its books come from the real transactions of dealers who are engaged in  different lines of business at their desks and in the offices. The small  office adjoining the bank, on the right, is a post office, the only one  in the country, perhaps, where true civil service rules are strictly  observed. In connection with it is a transportation office. From fifty  to a hundred letters daily are received and delivered by the post  office, written by or to the students of this department.    The correspondence thus indicated goes on not only between the students  of this college, but between members of this and other similar  institutions in different parts of the country. A perfected system of  intercommunication has for years been in practice between co-ordinate  schools in New York, Boston, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore,  and other cities, by which is carried on an elaborate scheme of  interchangeable business, little less real in its operations and results  than the more tangible and obtrusive activity which the world recognizes  as business.    The work of the transportation office corresponds with that of the post  office in its simulation of reality. The alleged articles handled are  represented by packages bearing all the characteristic marks of freight  and express packages. They are sent by mail to the transportation  company, and by this agency delivered to the proper parties, from whom  the charges are collected in due form, and the requisite vouchers  passed. Whatever is necessary in the way of manipulation to secure the  record on either hand is done, and, so far as the clerical duties are  concerned, there is no difference between handling pieces of paper which  represent merchandise and handling the real article.    In the bank is employed a regular working force, such as may be found in  any bank, consisting of a collector or runner, a discount clerk, a  deposit bookkeeper, a general bookkeeper, and a cashier. The books are  of the regular form, and the work is divided as in most banks of medium  size, and the business that is presented differs in no important  particular from that which comes to ordinary banks. After getting a fair  knowledge of theory, the student is placed in this bank. He begins in  the lowest place, and works up gradually to the highest, remaining long  enough in each position to acquaint himself with its duties. He is made  familiar with the form and purpose of all kinds of business paper, and  the rules which govern a bank's dealings with its customers. He gets a  practical knowledge of the law of indorsement and of negotiability  generally, and is called upon to decide important questions which arise  between the bank and its dealers. Wherever he finds himself at fault he  has access to a teacher whose duty it is to give the information for  which he asks, and who is competent to do it.    Throughout the whole of this course of study and practice the students  are treated like men and are expected to behave like men.    The college thus becomes a self-regulating community, in which the  students learn not only to govern themselves, but to direct and control  others. As one is advanced in position his responsibilities are  increased. He is first a merchant or agent, directing his own work;  next, a sub-manager, and finally manager in a general office or the  bank, with clerks subject to his direction and criticism, until he  arrives at the exalted position of \"superintendent of offices,\" which  gives him virtual control of the department. This is, in fact, an  important part of his training, and the reasonable effect of the system  is that the student, being subject to orders from those above him, and  remembering that he will shortly require a like consideration from those  below him, concludes that he cannot do a better thing for his own future  comfort than to set a wholesome example of subordination.    This, however, is not the only element of personal discipline that the  college affords. At every step the student's conduct, character, and  progress are noted, recorded, and securely kept for the teacher's  inspection, as well as that of his parents and himself. Such records are  kept in the budget room, shown in the lower left corner of the front  page.    This budget system was suggested by the difficulties encountered in  explaining to parents the progress and standing of their sons. The  inconvenience of summoning teachers, and of taking students from their  work, made necessary some simpler and more effective plan. The first  thing required of a new student is that he should give some account of  himself, and to submit to such examinations and tests as will acquaint  his teachers with his status. This account and these tests constitute  the subject-matter of his first budget, which is placed at the bottom of  his box, and every four weeks thereafter, while he remains in the  school, he is required to present the results of his work, such as his  written examinations in the various studies, his test examples in  arithmetic, his French, German, and Spanish translations and exercises,  various letters and forms, with four weekly specimens of improvement in  writing, the whole to be formally submitted to the principal in an  accompanying letter; the letter itself to exhibit what can be thus shown  of improvement in writing, expression, and general knowledge. These  budgets, accumulating month by month, are made to cover as much as  possible of the student's school work, and to constitute the visible  steps of his progress.    Besides this is a character record, kept in a small book assigned to  each student, every student having free access to his own record, but  not to that of any fellow student. Each book contains the record of a  student's deportment from the first to the last day of his attendance,  with such comments and recommendations as his several teachers may think  likely to be of encouragement or caution to him.    In addition to the strictly technical training furnished by the  college, there is given also not a little collateral instruction  calculated to be of practical use to business men. For example, after  roll call every morning some little time is spent in exercises designed  to cultivate the art of intelligent expression of ideas. Each day a  number of students are appointed to report orally, in the assembly room,  upon such matters or events mentioned in the previous day's newspapers  as may strike the speaker as interesting or important. Or the student  may describe his personal observation of any event, invention,  manufacture, or what not; or report upon the condition, history, or  prospects of any art, trade, or business undertaking. This not to teach  elocution, but to train the student to think while standing, and to  express himself in a straightforward, manly way.    Instruction is also given in the languages likely to be required in  business intercourse or correspondence; in phonography, so far as it may  be required for business purposes; commercial law relative to contracts,  negotiable paper, agencies, partnerships, insurance, and other business  proceedings and relations; political economy, and incidentally any and  every topic a knowledge of which may be of practical use to business  men.    In all this the ultimate end and aim of the instruction offered are  practical workable results. Mr. Packard regards education as a tool. If  the tool has no edge, is not adapted to its purpose, is not practically  usable, it is worthless as a tool. This idea is kept prominent in all  the work of the college, and its general results justify the position  thus taken. The graduates are not turned out as finished business men,  but as young men well started on the road toward that end. As Mr.  Packard puts it: \"Their diplomas do not recommend them as bank cashiers  or presidents, or as managers of large or small enterprises, but simply  as having a knowledge of the duties of accountantship. They rarely fail  to fulfill reasonable expectations; and they are not responsible for  unreasonable ones.\"           *       *       *       *       *          AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS.      The fourteenth annual convention of the American Institute of Architects  began in Philadelphia, November 17. Mr. Thomas U. Walter, of  Philadelphia, presided, and fifty or more prominent architects were  present. In his annual address the president spoke of the tendency of  the architectural world as decidedly in the direction of originality.  But little attention is paid to the types of building drawn from the  works of by-gone ages or to the mannerisms of the more recent past.  Progress in the development of the elements of taste and beauty, and the  concretion of aesthetic principles with common sense in architectural  design, are now everywhere apparent. The responsibilities of architects  are greater than they have ever before been; the growing demand of the  times calls for intelligent studies in all that relates to architecture,  whether it be in the realm of aesthetics, in sciences that relate to  construction, in the nature and properties of the materials used, in the  atmosphere that surrounds us, or in the availability of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#9)"],[1,"fagging he acquires the blessed power  himself to fag. In passing he launches, for the first recorded time,  against the master of the remove from which he has just been promoted,  an invective that in volume and intensity anticipates the wrath of later  attacks on Neapolitan kings and Turkish sultans.    His letters written from Eton breathe in every line the warm breath of  family affection, and of all those natural pieties that had so firm a  root in him from the beginning to the end. Of the later store of genius  and force that the touch of time was so soon to kindle into full glow,  they gave but little indication. We smile at the precocious _copia  fandi_ that at thirteen describes the language of an admonishing  acquaintance as 'so friendly, manly, sound, and disinterested that  notwithstanding his faults I must always think well of him.' He sends  contributions to his brother's scrap-book, and one of the first of them,  oddly enough, in view of one of the great preoccupations of his later  life, is a copy of Lord Edward Fitzgerald's stanzas on the night of his  arrest:--      'O Ireland, my country, the hour       Of thy pride and thy splendour has passed.     And the chain which was spurned in thy moment of power,       Hangs heavy around thee at last.'    The temper and dialect of evangelical religion are always there. A  friend of the family dies, and the boy pours out his regret, but after  all what is the merely natural death of Dr. N. compared with the awful  state of a certain clergyman, also an intimate friend, who has not only  been guilty of attending a fancy ball, but has followed that vicious  prelude by even worse enormities, unnamed, that surely cannot escape the  vigilance and the reproof of his bishop?    His father is the steady centre of his life. 'My father,' he writes to  his brother, 'is as active in mind and projects as ever; he has two  principal plans now in embryo. One of these is a railroad between  Liverpool and Manchester for the conveyance of goods by  locomotive-steam-engine. The other is for building a bridge over the  Mersey at Runcorn.' In May 1827, the Gloucester and Berkeley canal is  opened: 'a great and enterprising undertaking, but still there is no  fear of it beating Liverpool.' Meanwhile, 'what prodigiously quick  travelling to leave Eton at twelve on Monday, and reach home at eight on  Tuesday!' 'I have,' he says in 1826, 'lately been writing several  letters in the _Liverpool Courier_.' His father had been attacked in the  local prints for sundry economic inconsistencies, and the controversial  pen that was to know no rest for more than seventy years to come, was  now first employed, like the pious AEneas bearing off Anchises, in the  filial duty of repelling his sire's assailants. Ignorant of his nameless  champion, John Gladstone was much amused and interested by the anonymous  'Friend to Fair Dealing,' while the son was equally diverted by the  criticisms and conjectures of the parent.                              YOUTHFUL READING    With the formidable Keate the boy seems to have fared remarkably well,  and there are stories that he was even one of the tyrant's  favourites.[26] His school work was diligently supplemented. His daily  reading in 1826 covers a good deal of miscellaneous ground, including  Moliere and Racine, Blair's _Sermons_ ('not very substantial'), _Tom  Jones_, Tomline's _Life of Pitt_, Waterland's _Commentaries_, Leslie _on  Deism_, Locke's _Defence of The Reasonableness of Christianity_, which  he finds excellent; _Paradise Lost_, Milton's _Latin Poems_ and  _Epitaphium Damonis_ ('exquisite'), Massinger's _Fatal Dowry_ ('most  excellent'), Ben Jonson's _Alchemist_; Scott, including the _Bride of  Lammermoor_ ('a beautiful tale, indeed,' and in after life his favourite  of them all), Burke, Clarendon, and others of the shining host whose  very names are music to a scholar's ear. In the same year he reads 'a  most violent article on Milton by Macaulay, fair and unfair, clever and  silly, allegorical and bombastic, republican and anti-episcopal--a  strange composition, indeed.' In 1827 he went steadily through the  second half of Gibbon, whom he pronounces, 'elegant and acute as he is,  not so clear, so able, so attractive as Hume; does not impress my mind  so much.' In the same year he reads Coxe's _Walpole_, _Don Quixote_,  Hallam's _Constitutional History_, _Measure for Measure_ and _Much Ado_,  Massinger's _Grand Duke of Florence_, Ford's _Love's Melancholy_ ('much  of it good, the end remarkably beautiful') and _Broken Heart_ (which he  liked better than either the other or _'Tis Pity_), Locke _on  Toleration_ ('much repetition').    There is, of course, a steady refrain of Greek iambics, Greek anapaests,  'an easy and nice metre,' 'a hodge-podge lot of hendecasyllables,' and  thirty alcaic stanzas for a holiday task. Mention is made of many  sermons on 'Redeeming the time,' 'Weighed in the balance and found  wanting,' 'Cease to do evil, learn to do well,' and the other ever  unexhausted texts. One constant entry, we may be sure, is 'Read Bible,'  with Mant's notes. In a mood of deep piety he is prepared for  confirmation. His appearance at this time was recalled by one who had  been his fag, 'as a good-looking, rather delicate youth, with a pale  face and brown curling hair, always tidy and well dressed.'[27]    He became captain of the fifth at the end of October 1826, and on  February 20, 1827, Keate put him into the sixth. 'Was very civil,  indeed; told me to take pains, etc.: to be careful in using my  authority, etc.' He finds the sixth very preferable to all other parts  of the school, both as regards pleasure and opportunity for improvement.  They are more directly under the eye of Keate; he treats them with more  civility and speaks to them differently. So the days follow one another  very much alike--studious, cheerful, sociable, sedulous. The debates in  parliament take up a good deal of his time, and he is overwhelmed by the  horrible news of the defeat of the catholics in the House of Commons  (March 8,1827). On a summer's day in 1826, 'Mr. Canning here; inquired  after me and missed me.' He was not at Eton but at home when he heard of  Mr. Canning's death. 'Personally I must remember his kindness and  condescension, especially when he spoke to me of some verses which H.  Joy had injudiciously mentioned to him.'                                        II                               DEBATING SOCIETY    Youthful intellect is imitative, and in a great school so impregnated as  Eton with the spirit of public life and political association, the few  boys with active minds mimicked the strife of parliament in their  debating society, and copied the arts of journalism in the _Eton  Miscellany_. In both fields the young Gladstone took a leading part. The  debating society was afflicted with 'the premonitory lethargy of death,'  but the assiduous energy of Gaskell, seconded by the gifts of Gladstone,  Hallam, and Doyle, soon sent a new pulse beating through it. The  politics of the hour, that is to say everything not fifty years off,  were forbidden ground; but the execution of Strafford or of his royal  master, the deposition of Richard II., the last four years of the reign  of Queen Anne, the Peerage bill of 1719, the characters of Harley and  Bolingbroke, were themes that could be made by ingenious youth to admit  a hundred cunning sidelights upon the catholic question, the struggle of  the Greeks for independence, the hard case of Queen Caroline, and the  unlawfulness of swamping the tories in the House of Lords. On duller  afternoons they argued on the relative claims of mathematics and  metaphysics to be the better discipline of the human mind; whether  duelling is or is not inconsistent with the character that we ought to  seek; or whether the education of the poor is on the whole beneficial.  It was on this last question (October 29, 1825) that the orator who made  his last speech seventy years later, now made his first. 'Made my first  or maiden speech at the society,' he enters in his diary, 'on education  of the poor; funked less than I thought I should, by much.' It is a  curious but a characteristic circumstance not that so many of his Eton  speeches were written out, but that the manuscript should have been  thriftily preserved by him all through the long space of intervening  years. 'Mr. President,' it begins, 'in this land of liberty, in this age  of increased and gradually increasing civilization, we shall hope to  find few, if indeed any, among the higher classes who are eager or  willing to obstruct the moral instruction and mental improvement of  their fellow creatures in the humbler walks of life. If such there are,  let them at length remember that the poor are endowed with the same  reason, though not blessed with the same temporal advantages. Let them  but admit, what I think no one can deny, that they are placed in an  elevated situation principally for the purpose of doing good to their  fellow creatures. Then by what argument can they repel, by what pretence  can they evade the duty?' And so forth and so forth. Already we seem to  hear the born speaker in the amplitude of rhetorical form in which,  juvenile though it may be, a commonplace is cast. 'Is human grandeur so  stable that they may deny to others that which they would in an humble  situation desire themselves? Or has human pride reached such a pitch of  arrogance that they have learned to defy both right and reason, to  reject the laws of natural kindness that ought to reign in the breast of  all, and to look on their fellow countrymen as the refuse of mankind?...  Is it morally just or politically expedient to keep down the industry  and genius of the artisan, to blast his rising hopes, to quell his  spirit? A thirst for knowledge has arisen in the minds of the poor; let  them satisfy it with wholesome nutriment and beware lest driven to  "]]]
