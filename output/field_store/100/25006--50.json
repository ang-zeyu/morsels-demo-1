[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#9)"],[1," and Jesus.\" Similar statements have been made by Imam 'Ali. Sayings  such as these, which indicate the essential unity of those Exponents of  Oneness, have also emanated from the Channels of God's immortal utterance,  and the Treasuries of the gems of Divine knowledge, and have been recorded  in the Scriptures. These Countenances are the recipients of the Divine  Command, and the Day Springs of His Revelation. This Revelation is exalted  above the veils of plurality and the exigencies of number. Thus He saith:  \"Our Cause is but One.\" Inasmuch as the Cause is one and the same, the  Exponents thereof also must needs be one and the same. Likewise, the Imams  of the Muhammadan Faith, those lamps of certitude, have said: \"Muhammad is  our first, Muhammad is our last, Muhammad our all.\"    It is clear and evident to thee that all the Prophets are the Temples of  the Cause of God, Who have appeared clothed in divers attire. If thou wilt  observe with discriminating eyes, thou wilt behold Them all abiding in the  same tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the same throne,  uttering the same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith. Such is the  unity of those Essences of Being, those Luminaries of infinite and  immeasurable splendor! Wherefore, should one of these Manifestations of  Holiness proclaim saying: \"I am the return of all the Prophets,\" He,  verily, speaketh the truth. In like manner, in every subsequent  Revelation, the return of the former Revelation is a fact, the truth of  which is firmly established....    The other station is the station of distinction, and pertaineth to the  world of creation, and to the limitations thereof. In this respect, each  Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a definitely  prescribed mission, a predestined revelation, and specially designated  limitations. Each one of them is known by a different name, is  characterized by a special attribute, fulfils a definite mission, and is  entrusted with a particular Revelation. Even as He saith: \"Some of the  Apostles We have caused to excel the others. To some God hath spoken, some  He hath raised and exalted. And to Jesus, Son of Mary, We gave manifest  signs, and We strengthened Him with the Holy Spirit.\"    It is because of this difference in their station and mission that the  words and utterances flowing from these Well Springs of Divine knowledge  appear to diverge and differ. Otherwise, in the eyes of them that are  initiated into the mysteries of Divine wisdom, all their utterances are,  in reality, but the expressions of one Truth. As most of the people have  failed to appreciate those stations to which We have referred, they,  therefore, feel perplexed and dismayed at the varying utterances  pronounced by Manifestations that are essentially one and the same.    It hath ever been evident that all these divergencies of utterance are  attributable to differences of station. Thus, viewed from the standpoint  of their oneness and sublime detachment, the attributes of Godhead,  Divinity, Supreme Singleness, and Inmost Essence, have been, and are  applicable to those Essences of Being, inasmuch as they all abide on the  throne of Divine Revelation, and are established upon the seat of Divine  Concealment. Through their appearance the Revelation of God is made  manifest, and by their countenance the Beauty of God is revealed. Thus it  is that the accents of God Himself have been heard uttered by these  Manifestations of the Divine Being.    Viewed in the light of their second station--the station of distinction,  differentiation, temporal limitations, characteristics and standards--they  manifest absolute servitude, utter destitution, and complete  self-effacement. Even as He saith: \"I am the servant of God. I am but a  man like you.\"...    Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: \"I am  God,\" He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth thereto. For  it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their Revelation, their  attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His names and His attributes,  are made manifest in the world. Thus, He hath revealed: \"Those shafts were  God's, not Thine.\" And also He saith: \"In truth, they who plighted fealty  unto Thee, really plighted that fealty unto God.\" And were any of them to  voice the utterance, \"I am the Messenger of God,\" He, also, speaketh the  truth, the indubitable truth. Even as He saith: \"Muhammad is not the  father of any man among you, but He is the Messenger of God.\" Viewed in  this light, they are all but Messengers of that ideal King, that  unchangeable Essence. And were they all to proclaim, \"I am the Seal of the  Prophets,\" they, verily, utter but the truth, beyond the faintest shadow  of doubt. For they are all but one person, one soul, one spirit, one  being, one revelation. They are all the manifestation of the \"Beginning\"  and the \"End,\" the \"First\" and the \"Last,\" the \"Seen\" and the \"Hidden\"--all  of which pertain to Him Who is the Innermost Spirit of Spirits and Eternal  Essence of Essences. And were they to say, \"We are the Servants of God,\"  this also is a manifest and indisputable fact. For they have been made  manifest in the uttermost state of servitude, a servitude the like of  which no man can possibly attain. Thus in moments in which these Essences  of Being were deep immersed beneath the oceans of ancient and everlasting  holiness, or when they soared to the loftiest summits of Divine mysteries,  they claimed their utterances to be the Voice of Divinity, the Call of God  Himself.    Were the eye of discernment to be opened, it would recognize that in this  very state, they have considered themselves utterly effaced and  non-existent in the face of Him Who is the All-Pervading, the  Incorruptible. Methinks, they have regarded themselves as utter  nothingness, and deemed their mention in that Court an act of blasphemy.  For the slightest whispering of self within such a Court is an evidence of  self-assertion and independent existence. In the eyes of them that have  attained unto that Court, such a suggestion is itself a grievous  transgression. How much more grievous would it be, were aught else to be  mentioned in that Presence, were man's heart, his tongue, his mind, or his  soul, to be busied with any one but the Well-Beloved, were his eyes to  behold any countenance other than His beauty, were his ear to be inclined  to any melody but His Voice, and were his feet to tread any way but His  way....    By virtue of this station they have claimed for themselves the Voice of  Divinity and the like, whilst by virtue of their station of Messengership,  they have declared themselves the Messengers of God. In every instance  they have voiced an utterance that would conform to the requirements of  the occasion, and have ascribed all these declarations to Themselves,  declarations ranging from the realm of Divine Revelation to the realm of  creation, and from the domain of Divinity even unto the domain of earthly  existence. Thus it is that whatsoever be their utterance, whether it  pertain to the realm of Divinity, Lordship, Prophethood, Messengership,  Guardianship, Apostleship, or Servitude, all is true, beyond the shadow of  a doubt. Therefore these sayings which We have quoted in support of Our  argument must be attentively considered, that the divergent utterances of  the Manifestations of the Unseen and Day Springs of Holiness may cease to  agitate the soul and perplex the mind.            XXIII: CONSIDER THE FORMER GENERATIONS. WITNESS...      Consider the former generations. Witness how every time the Day Star of  Divine bounty hath shed the light of His Revelation upon the world, the  people of His Day have arisen against Him, and repudiated His truth. They  who were regarded as the leaders of men have invariably striven to hinder  their followers from turning unto Him Who is the Ocean of God's limitless  bounty.    Behold how the people, as a result of the verdict pronounced by the  divines of His age, have cast Abraham, the Friend of God, into fire; how  Moses, He Who held converse with the Almighty, was denounced as liar and  slanderer. Reflect how Jesus, the Spirit of God, was, notwithstanding His  extreme meekness and perfect tender-heartedness, treated by His enemies.  So fierce was the opposition which He, the Essence of Being and Lord of  the visible and invisible, had to face, that He had nowhere to lay His  head. He wandered continually from place to place, deprived of a permanent  abode. Ponder that which befell Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, may  the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him. How severe the afflictions  which the leaders of the Jewish people and of the idol-worshipers caused  to rain upon Him, Who is the sovereign Lord of all, in consequence of His  proclamation of the unity of God and of the truth of His Message! By the  righteousness of My Cause! My Pen groaneth, and all created things weep  with a great weeping, as a result of the woes He suffered at the hands of  them that have broken the Covenant of God, violated His Testament,  rejected His proofs, and disputed His signs. Thus recount We unto thee the  tale of that which happened in days past, haply thou mayest comprehend.    Thou hast known how grievously the Prophets of God, His Messengers and  Chosen Ones, have been afflicted. Meditate a while on the motive and  reason which have been responsible for such a persecution. At no time, in  no Dispensation, have the Prophets of God escaped the blasphemy of their  enemies, the cruelty of their oppressors, the denunciation of the learned  of their age, who appeared in the guise of uprightness and piety. Day and  night they passed through such agonies as none can ever measure, except  the knowledge of the one true God, exalted be His glory.    Consider this wronged One. Though the clearest proofs attest the truth of  His Cause; though the prophecies He, in an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#9)"],[1,"still in our possession, and the          other is an arrow sent from the bow.\" And another          Persian poet, whose name I have not ascertained,          eloquently exclaims: \"O my heart! if thou desirest ease          in this life, keep thy secrets undisclosed, like the          modest rose-bud. Take warning from that lovely flower,          which, by expanding its hitherto hidden beauties when in          full bloom, gives its leaves and its happiness to the          winds.\"    The imperative duty of active benevolence is thus inculcated: \"Bestow  thy gold and thy wealth while they are thine; for when thou art gone  they will be no longer in thy power. Distribute thy treasure readily  to-day, for to-morrow the key may be no longer in thy hand. Exert  thyself to cast a covering over the poor, that God's own veil may be a  covering to thee.\"    In the following passage the man of learning and virtue is contrasted  with the stupid and ignorant blockhead:    \"If a wise man, falling into company with mean people, does not get  credit for his discourse, be not surprised, for the sound of the harp  cannot overpower the noise of the drum, and the fragrance of ambergris  is overcome by fetid garlic. The ignorant fellow was proud of his loud  voice, because he had impudently confounded the man of understanding. If  a jewel falls in the mud it is still the same precious stone,[20] and if  dust flies up to the sky it retains its original baseness. A capacity  without education is deplorable, and education without capacity is  thrown away. Sugar obtains not its value from the cane, but from its  innate quality. Musk has fragrance of itself, and not from being called  a perfume by the druggist. The wise man is like the druggist's chest,  silent, but full of virtues; while the blockhead resembles the warrior's  drum, noisy, but an empty prattler. A wise man in the company of those  who are ignorant has been compared by the sages to a beautiful girl in  the company of blind men, and to the Kuran in the house of an  infidel.\"--The old proverb that \"an evil bird has an evil egg\" finds  expression by Saadi thus: \"No one whose origin is bad ever catches the  reflection of the good.\" Again, he says: \"How can we make a good sword  out of bad iron? A worthless person cannot by education become a person  of any worth.\" And yet again: \"Evil habits which have taken root in  one's nature will only be got rid of at the hour of death.\"       [20] Is such a thing as an emerald made worse than it was if          it is not praised?--_Marcus Aurelius_.              If glass be used to decorate a crown,            While gems are taken to bedeck a foot,            'Tis not that any fault lies in the gem,            But in the want of knowledge of the setter.            --_Panchatantra_, a famous Indian book of Fables.    Firdausi, the Homer of Persia (eleventh century), has the following  remarks in his scathing satire on the sultan Mahmud, of Ghazni  (Atkinson's rendering):      Alas! from vice can goodness ever spring?    Is mercy hoped for in a tyrant king?    Can water wash the Ethiopian white?    Can we remove the darkness from the night?    The tree to which a bitter fruit is given    Would still be bitter in the bowers of heaven;    And a bad heart keeps on its vicious course,    Or, if it changes, changes for the worse;    Whilst streams of milk where Eden's flow'rets blow    Acquire more honied sweetness as they flow.    The striking words of the Great Teacher, \"How hardly shall they that  have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\" find an interesting analogue  in this passage by Saadi: \"There is a saying of the Prophet, 'To the  poor death is a state of rest.' The ass that carries the lightest burden  travels easiest. In like manner, the good man who bears the burden of  poverty will enter the gate of death lightly loaded, while he who lives  in affluence, with ease and comfort, will, doubtless, on that very  account find death very terrible. And in any view, the captive who is  released from confinement is happier than the noble who is taken  prisoner.\"    A singular anecdote is told of another celebrated Persian poet, which  may serve as a kind of commentary on this last-cited passage: Faridu  'd-Din 'Attar, who died in the year 1229, when over a hundred years old,  was considered the most perfect Sufi[21] philosopher of the time in  which he lived. His father was an eminent druggist in Nishapur, and for  a time Faridu 'd-Din followed the same profession, and his shop was the  delight of all who passed by it, from the neatness of its arrangements  and the fragrant odours of drugs and essences. 'Attar, which means  druggist, or perfumer, Faridu 'd-Din adopted for his poetical title. One  day, while sitting at his door with a friend, an aged dervish drew near,  and, after looking anxiously and closely into the well-furnished shop,  he sighed heavily and shed tears, as he reflected on the transitory  nature of all earthly things. 'Attar, mistaking the sentiment uppermost  in the mind of the venerable devotee, ordered him to be gone, to which  he meekly rejoined: \"Yes, I have nothing to prevent me from leaving thy  door, or, indeed, from quitting this world at once, as my sole  possession is this threadbare garment. But O 'Attar, I grieve for thee:  for how canst thou ever bring thyself to think of death--to leave all  these goods behind thee?\" 'Attar replied that he hoped and believed that  he should die as contentedly as any dervish; upon which the aged  devotee, saying, \"We shall see,\" placed his wooden bowl upon the ground,  laid his head upon it, and, calling on the name of God, immediately  resigned his soul. Deeply impressed with this incident, 'Attar at once  gave up his shop, and devoted himself to the study of Sufi  philosophy.[22]       [21] The Sufis are the mystics of Islam, and their poetry,          while often externally anacreontic--bacchanalian and          erotic--possesses an esoteric, spiritual signification:          the sensual world is employed to symbolise that which is          to be apprehended only by the _inward_ sense. Most of          the great poets of Persia, Afghanistan, and Turkey are          generally understood to have been Sufis.       [22] Sir Gore Ouseley's _Biographical Notices of Persian Poets_.    The death of Cardinal Mazarin furnishes another remarkable illustration  of Saadi's sentiment. A day or two before he died, the cardinal caused  his servant to carry him into his magnificent art gallery, where, gazing  upon his collection of pictures and sculpture, he cried in anguish, \"And  must I leave all these?\" Dr. Johnson may have had Mazarin's words in  mind when he said to Garrick, while being shown over the famous actor's  splendid mansion: \"Ah, Davie, Davie, these are the things that make a  death-bed terrible!\"    Few passages of Shakspeare are more admired than these lines:      And this our life, exempt from public haunts,    Finds _tongues in trees_, books in the running brooks,    Sermons in stones, and good in everything.[23]       [23] Cf. these lines, from Herrick's \"Hesperides\":              But you are _lovely leaves_, where we              May read, how soon things have              Their end, tho' ne'er so brave;            And after they have shown their pride,              Like you, a while, they glide                    Into the grave.    Saadi had thus expressed the same sentiment before him: \"The foliage of  a newly-clothed tree, to the eye of a discerning man, displays a whole  volume of the wondrous works of the Creator.\" Another Persian poet,  Jami, in his beautiful mystical poem of _Yusuf wa Zulaykha_, says:  \"Every leaf is a tongue uttering praises, like one who keepeth crying,  'In the name of God.'\"[24] And the Afghan poet Abdu 'r-Rahman says:  \"Every tree, every shrub, stands ready to bend before him; every herb  and blade of grass is a tongue to mutter his praises.\" And Horace Smith,  that most pleasing but unpretentious writer, both of verse and prose,  has thus finely amplified the idea of \"tongues in trees\":      Your voiceless lips, O Flowers, are living preachers,    Each cup a pulpit, every leaf a book,    Supplying to my fancy numerous teachers,                    From loneliest nook.      'Neath cloistered boughs, each floral bell that swingeth,    And tolls its perfume on the passing air,    Makes Sabbath in the fields, and ever ringeth                    A call to prayer;--      Not to the domes where crumbling arch and column    Attest the feebleness of mortal hand,    But to that fane, most catholic and solemn,                    Which God hath planned:      To that cathedral, boundless as our wonder,    Whose quenchless lamps the sun and moon supply;    Its choir, the winds and waves, its organ, thunder,                    Its dome, the sky.      There, amid solitude and shade, I wander    Through the green aisles, and, stretched upon the sod,    Awed by the silence, reverently ponder                    The ways of God.       [24] \"In the name of God\" is part of the formula employed by          pious Muslims in their acts of worship, and on entering          upon any enterprise of danger or          uncertainty--_bi'smi'llahi ar-rahman ar-rahimi_, \"In the          name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!\" These          words are usually placed at the beginning of Muhammedan          books, secular as well as religions; and they form part          of the Muslim Confession of Faith, used in the last          extremity: \"In the name of God, the Merciful, the          Compassionate! There is no strength nor any power save          in God, the High, the Mighty. To God we belong, and          verily to him we return!\"           *       *       *       *       *    When Saadi composed his _Gulistan_, in 1278, he was between eighty and  ninety years of age, with his great mind still vigorous as ever; and he  lived many years after, beloved"]]]
