Will ye not fear the One true God, He  Who is your Lord, the Ancient of Days?... O ye who profess belief in God!  I adjure you by Him Who is the Eternal Truth, have ye discerned among the  precepts of these Gates anything inconsistent with the commandments of God  as set forth in this Book? Hath your learning deluded you by reason of  your impiety? Take ye heed then, for verily your God, the Lord of Eternal  Truth, is with you and in very truth is watchful over you... _Chapter  XXVII._          \"O ye kinsmen of the Most Great Remembrance! This ...\"      O ye kinsmen of the Most Great Remembrance! This Tree of Holiness, dyed  crimson with the oil of servitude, hath verily sprung forth out of your  own soil in the midst of the Burning Bush, yet ye comprehend nothing  whatever thereof, neither of His true, heavenly attributes, nor of the  actual circumstances of His earthly life, nor of the evidences of His  powerful and unblemished behaviour. Actuated by your own fancies, you  consider Him to be alien to the sovereign Truth, while in the estimation  of God He is none other than the Promised One Himself, invested with the  power of the sovereign Truth, and verily He is, as decreed in the Mother  Book, held answerable in the midst of the Burning Bush...    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Deliver the summons of the most exalted Word unto the  handmaids among Thy kindred, caution them against the Most Great Fire and  announce unto them the joyful tidings that following this mighty Covenant  there shall be everlasting reunion with God in the Paradise of His  good-pleasure, nigh unto the Seat of Holiness. Verily God, the Lord of  creation, is potent over all things.    O Thou Mother of the Remembrance! May the peace and salutation of God rest  upon thee. Indeed thou hast endured patiently in Him Who is the sublime  Self of God. Recognize then the station of thy Son Who is none other than  the mighty Word of God. He hath verily pledged Himself to be answerable  for thee both in thy grave and on the Judgement Day, while thou hast, in  the Preserved Tablet of God, been immortalized as the 'Mother of the  Faithful' by the Pen of His Remembrance. _Chapter XXVIII._          \"O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Stretch not Thy hands wide open ...\"      O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Stretch not Thy hands wide open in the Cause, inasmuch  as the people would find themselves in a state of stupor by reason of the  Mystery, and I swear by the true, Almighty God that there is yet for Thee  another turn after this Dispensation.    And when the appointed hour hath struck, do Thou, by the leave of God, the  All-Wise, reveal from the heights of the Most Lofty and Mystic Mount a  faint, an infinitesimal glimmer of Thy impenetrable Mystery, that they who  have recognized the radiance of the Sinaic Splendour may faint away and  die as they catch a lightning glimpse of the fierce and crimson Light that  envelops Thy Revelation. And God is, in very truth, Thine unfailing  Protector. _Chapter XXVIII._          \"O People of Persia! Are ye not satisfied with this glorious ...\"      O People of Persia! Are ye not satisfied with this glorious honour which  the supreme Remembrance of God hath conferred upon you? Verily ye have  been especially favoured by God through this mighty Word. Then do not  withdraw from the sanctuary of His presence, for, by the righteousness of  the One true God, He is none other than the sovereign Truth from God; He  is the most exalted One and the Source of all wisdom, as decreed in the  Mother Book...    O peoples of the earth! Cleave ye tenaciously to the Cord of the  All-Highest God, which is but this Arabian Youth, Our Remembrance--He Who  standeth concealed at the point of ice amidst the ocean of fire. _Chapter  XXIX._          \"O People of the earth! By the righteousness of the One ...\"      O People of the earth! By the righteousness of the One true God, I am the  Maid of Heaven begotten by the Spirit of Baha, abiding within the Mansion  hewn out of a mass of ruby, tender and vibrant; and in this mighty  Paradise naught have I ever witnessed save that which proclaimeth the  Remembrance of God by extolling the virtues of this Arabian Youth. Verily  there is none other God but your Lord, the All-Merciful. Magnify ye, then,  His station, for behold, He is poised in the midmost heart of the  All-Highest Paradise as the embodiment of the praise of God in the  Tabernacle wherein His glorification is intoned.    At one time I hear His Voice as He acclaimeth Him Who is the Ever-Living,  the Ancient of Days, and at another time as He speaketh of the mystery of  His most august Name. And when He intoneth the anthems of the greatness of  God all Paradise waileth in its longing to gaze on His Beauty, and when He  chanteth words of praise and glorification of God all Paradise becomes  motionless like unto ice locked in the heart of a frost-bound mountain.  Methinks I visioned Him moving along a straight middle path wherein every  paradise was His Own paradise, every heaven His Own heaven, while the  whole earth and all that is therein appeared but as a ring upon the finger  of His servants. Glorified be God, His Creator, the Lord of everlasting  sovereignty. Verily He is none other but the servant of God, the Gate of  the Remnant of God your Lord, the Sovereign Truth. _Chapter XXIX._          \"O Thou the Supreme Word of God! Fear not, nor be ...\"      O Thou the Supreme Word of God! Fear not, nor be Thou grieved, for indeed  unto such as have responded to Thy Call, whether men or women, We have  assured forgiveness of sins, as known in the presence of the Best Beloved  and in conformity with what Thou desirest. Verily His knowledge embraceth  all things. I adjure Thee by My life, set Thy face towards Me and be not  apprehensive. Verily Thou art the Exalted One among the Celestial  Concourse, and Thy hidden Mystery hath, of a truth, been recorded upon the  Tablet of creation in the midst of the Burning Bush. Ere long God will  bestow upon Thee rulership over all men, inasmuch as His rule transcendeth  the whole of creation. _Chapter XXXI._          \"O Concourse of Shi'ihs! Fear ye God and Our Cause ...\"      O Concourse of _Sh_i'ihs! Fear ye God and Our Cause which concerneth Him  Who is the Most Great Remembrance of God. For great is its fire, as  decreed in the Mother Book. _Chapter XL._          \"Recite ye as much as convenient from this Qur'an both ...\"      Recite ye as much as convenient from this Qur'an both at morn and at  eventide, and chant the verses of this Book, by the leave of the eternal  God, in the sweet accents of this Bird which warbleth its melody in the  vault of heaven. _Chapter XLI._          \"Issue forth from your cities, O peoples of the West and ...\"      Issue forth from your cities, O peoples of the West and aid God ere the  Day when the Lord of mercy shall come down unto you in the shadow of the  clouds with the angels circling around Him,(30) exalting His praise and  seeking forgiveness for such as have truly believed in Our signs. Verily  His decree hath been issued, and the command of God, as given in the  Mother Book, hath indeed been revealed...    Become as true brethren in the one and indivisible religion of God, free  from distinction, for verily God desireth that your hearts should become  mirrors unto your brethren in the Faith, so that ye find yourselves  reflected in them, and they in you. This is the true Path of God, the  Almighty, and He is indeed watchful over your actions. _Chapter XLVI._          \"O ye peoples of the earth! Hearken unto My call, ringing ...\"      O ye peoples of the earth! Hearken unto My call, ringing forth from the  precincts of this sacred Tree--a Tree set ablaze by the pre-existent Fire:  There is no God but Him; He is the Exalted, the All-Wise. O ye the  servants of the Merciful One! Enter ye, one and all, through this Gate and  follow not the steps of the Evil One, for he prompteth you to walk in the  ways of impiety and wickedness; he is, in truth, your declared enemy.(31)  _Chapter LI._          \"Be Thou patient, O Qurratu'l-'Ayn, for God hath indeed ...\"      Be Thou patient, O Qurratu'l-'Ayn, for God hath indeed pledged to  establish Thy sovereignty throughout all countries and over the people  that dwell therein. He is God and verily He is powerful over all things.  _Chapter LIII._          \"By My glory! I will make the infidels to taste, with the ...\"      By My glory! I will make the infidels to taste, with the hands of My  power, retributions unknown of any one except Me, and will waft over the  faithful those musk-scented breaths which I have nursed in the midmost  heart of My throne; and verily the knowledge of God embraceth all things.    O concourse of light! By the righteousness of God, We speak not according  to selfish desire, nor hath a single letter of this Book been revealed  save by the leave of God, the Sovereign Truth. Fear ye God and entertain  no doubts regarding His Cause, for verily, the Mystery of this Gate is  shrouded in the mystic utterances of His Writ and hath been written beyond  the impenetrable veil of concealment by the hand of God, the Lord of the  visible and the invisible.    Indeed God hath created everywhere around this Gate oceans of divine  elixir, tinged crimson with the essence of existence and vitalized through  the animating power of the desired fruit; and for them God hath provided  Arks of ruby, tender, crimson-coloured, wherein none shall sail but the  people of Baha, by the leave of God, the Most Exalted; and verily He is  the All-Glorious, the All-Wise. _Chapter LVII._          \"The Lord hath, in truth, inspired Me: Verily, verily, I am ...\"      The Lord hath, in truth, inspired Me: Verily, verily, I am God, He besides  Whom there is none other God, and I am indeed the Ancient of Days...

Long ere this Mr. James and the boats' crews had  gained the vessel, and were engaged in combating the fire, which had  broken out in three places.    The boats were sent back to shore, and returned with Captain Thompson  and the rest of the sailors, and this reinforcement soon enabled them  to get the mastery of the flames. The ship was found to be the Dover  Castle, a new and very fast ship of the Company's service, of which  all traces had been lost since she left Bombay two years before. She  was now painted entirely black, and a snake had been added for her  figurehead. The original name, however, still remained upon the  binnacle and ship's bell. Her former armament had been increased and  she now carried thirty guns, of which ten were thirty-two pounders.    A subsequent search showed that her hold was stored with valuable  goods; which had, by the marks upon the bales, evidently belonged to  several ships; which she had, no doubt, taken and sunk after removing  the pick of their cargoes. The prize was a most valuable one, and the  captain felt that the board of directors would be highly delighted at  the recovery of their ship, and still more by the destruction of the  two bands of pirates.    The deck of the ship was thickly strewn with dead. Among them was the  body of a man who, by his dress, was evidently the captain. From some  of the pirates who still lived, Captain Thompson learned that the brig  was the original pirate, that she had captured the Dover Castle, that  from her and subsequent prizes they had obtained sufficient hands to  man both ships, all who refused to join being compelled to walk the  plank. These were the only two pirate ships in those seas, so far as  the men knew. Their rendezvous was at a large native town on the  mainland, at the mouth of a river three days' sail distant.    The news of the Indiaman being laid up, refitting at the island, was  brought by the native craft they had seen on the day after their  arrival; and upon its being known, the natives had insisted in joining  in the attack. The pirate captain, whose interest it was to keep well  with them, could not refuse to allow them to join, although he would  gladly have dispensed with their aid, believing his own force to be  far more than sufficient to capture the vessel, which he supposed to  be lying an easy prize at his hands.    Another ten days were spent in getting the cargo and guns on board the  Lizzie Anderson, and in fitting out both ships for sea. Then, Mr.  James and a portion of the crew being placed on board the prize, they  sailed together for India. The Dover Castle proved to be much the  faster sailer, but Captain Thompson ordered her to reduce sail, and to  keep about a mile in his wake, as she could at any time close up when  necessary; and the two, together, would be able to oppose a determined  front, even to a French frigate, should they meet with one on their  way.    The voyage passed without incident save that, when rounding the  southern point of Ceylon, a sudden squall from the land struck them.  The vessel heeled over suddenly, and a young soldier, who was sitting  on the bulwarks to leeward, was jerked backwards and fell into the  water.    Charlie Marryat was on the quarterdeck, leaning against the rail,  watching a shoal of flying fish passing at a short distance. In the  noise and confusion, caused by the sudden squall, the creaking of  cordage, the flapping of sails, and the shouts of the officer to let  go the sheets, the fall of the soldier was unnoticed; and Charlie was  startled by perceiving, in the water below him, the figure of a  struggling man.    He saw, at once, that he was unable to swim. Without an instant's  hesitation Charlie threw off his coat, and kicked off his shoes, and  with a loud shout of \"Man overboard!\" sprang from the taffrail and,  with a few vigorous strokes, was alongside the drowning man. He seized  him by the collar, and held him at a distance.    \"Now,\" he said, \"don't struggle, else I'll let you go. Keep quiet, and  I can hold you up till we're picked up.\"    In spite of the injunction, the man strove to grasp him; but Charlie  at once let go his hold, and swam a pace back as the man sunk. When he  came up he seized him again, and again shouted:    \"Keep quite quiet, else I'll leave go.\"    This time the soldier obeyed him and, turning him on his back, and  keeping his face above water, Charlie looked around at the vessel he  had left.    The Indiaman was still in confusion. The squall had been sudden and  strong. The sheets had been let go, the canvas was flapping in the  wind, and the hands were aloft reducing sail. She was already some  distance away from him. The sky was bright and clear, and Charlie, who  was surprised at seeing no attempt to lower a boat, saw a signal run  up to the masthead.    Looking the other way, he saw at once why no boat had been lowered.  The Dover Castle was but a quarter of a mile astern. Carrying less  sail than her consort, she had been better prepared for the squall,  and was running down upon him at a great rate.    A moment later a boat was swung out on davits, and several men climbed  into it. The vessel kept on her course, until scarcely more than her  own length away. Then she suddenly rounded up into the wind, and the  boat was let fall, and rowed rapidly towards him.    All this time, Charlie had made no effort beyond what was necessary to  keep his own head, and his companion's face, above the water. He now  lifted the soldier's head up, and shouted to him that aid was at hand.  In another minute they were dragged into the boat. This was soon  alongside the ship, and three minutes later the Dover Castle was  pursuing her course, in the track of the Lizzie Anderson, having  signalled that the pair had been rescued.    Charlie found that the soldier was an Irish lad, of some nineteen  years old. His name, he said, was Tim Kelly, and as soon as he had  recovered himself sufficiently to speak, he was profuse in his  professions of gratitude to his preserver. Tim, like the majority of  the recruits in the Company's service, had been enlisted while in a  state of drunkenness; had been hurried on board a guard ship, where,  when he recovered, he found a number of other unfortunates like  himself. He had not been permitted to communicate with his friends on  shore, but had been kept in close confinement, until he had been put  in uniform and conveyed on board the Lizzie Anderson, half an hour  before she sailed.    The Company's service was not a popular one. There was no fighting in  India, and neither honor, glory, nor promotion to be won. The climate  was unsuited to Europeans, and few, indeed, of those who sailed from  England as soldiers in the Company's service ever returned. The  Company, then, were driven to all sorts of straits to keep up even the  small force which they then maintained in India, and their recruiting  agents were, by no means, particular as to the means they employed to  make up the tale of recruits.    The vessels did not again communicate until they came to anchor in  Madras roads, as the wind was fair and Captain Thompson anxious to  arrive at his destination. During these few days, Tim Kelly had  followed Charlie about like a shadow. Having no duties to perform on  board, he asked leave to act as Charlie's servant; and Charlie was  touched by the efforts which the grateful fellow made to be of service  to him.    Upon their arrival they saw, to their satisfaction, that the British  flag was waving over the low line of earthworks, which constitute the  British fort. Not far from this, near the water's edge, stood the  white houses and stores of the Company's factors; and behind these,  again, were the low hovels of the black town. The prospect was not an  inviting one, and Charlie wondered how on earth a landing was to be  effected, through the tremendous surf which broke upon the shore.    He soon found that, until the wind went down and the surf moderated  somewhat, no communication could be effected. The next morning,  however, the wind lulled, and a crowd of curious native boats were  seen putting off from the shore.    Charlie had, after the vessel anchored, rejoined his ship with Tim  Kelly, and he now bade goodbye to all on board; for only the doctor,  two civilians, and the troops were destined for Madras; all the rest  going on in the ship to Calcutta, after she had discharged that  portion of her cargo intended for Madras. Charlie had, during the last  twelve hours, been made a great deal of, on account of the gallantry  he had displayed in risking his life for that of the soldier. Peters  and one of the other young writers were also to land; and, taking his  seat with these in a native boat, paddled by twelve canoe men, he  started for the shore.    As they approached the line of surf, Charlie fairly held his breath;  for it seemed impossible that the boat could live through it. The  boatmen, however, ceased rowing outside the line of broken water, and  lay on their paddles for three or four minutes.    At last a wave, larger than any of its predecessors, was seen  approaching. As it passed under them, the steersman gave a shout. In  an instant the rowers struck their paddles into the water, and the  boat dashed along, with the speed of a racehorse, on the crest of the  wave. There was a crash. For a moment the boat seemed, to the lads,  engulfed in white foam; and then she ran high up upon the beach. The  rowers seized the boys and, leaping out, carried them beyond the reach  of the water, before the next wave broke upon them; and then  triumphantly demanded a present, for their skilful management. This  the lads were glad to give, for they considered that their escape had  been something miraculous.    For a while they stood on the"]]]
