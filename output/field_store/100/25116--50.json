All right, you play it--but not with me.\"    \"And what are you going to do, take to the woods?\"    \"What I do is my business, Hume.\"    \"No, my business, too, very much so. I'm giving you a warning, boy, in  return for your help here.\" He nodded at the pit. \"There's something  in that woods--something which didn't show up when the Guild had their  survey exploration here.\"    \"The watchers.\" Rynch retreated step by step, keeping the needler  ready. \"I saw them.\"    \"You've seen them!\" Hume was eager. \"What do they look like?\"    In spite of his desire to be rid of Hume, Rynch found himself  answering that in detail, discovering that on demand he could recall  minutely the description of the animal hiding in the tree, the one who  had waited in the shelter, and those he had glimpsed drawing in about  the L-B clearing.    \"No intelligence.\" Hume turned his head to survey the distant wood.  \"The verifier reported no intelligence.\"    \"These watchers--you don't know them?\"    \"No. Nor do I like what you've seen of them, Brodie. So I'm willing to  call a truce. The Guild believed Jumala an open planet, our records  accredited it so. If that is not true we may be in for bad trouble. As  an Out-Hunter I am responsible for the safety of three civs back there  in the safari camp.\"    Hume made sense, much as Rynch disliked admitting it. And the Hunter  must have read something of his agreement in his face for now he  nodded and added briskly:    \"Best place now is the safari camp. We'll head back at once.\"    Only time had run out. A noise sounded with a metallic ring. Rynch  whirled, needler cocked. A glittering ball about the size of his fist  rolled away from contact with a boulder, came to rest in the deep  depression of one of Hume's boot tracks. Then another flash through  the air, a clatter as a second ball spun across a patch of gravel.    The balls seemed to appear out of the air. Displaying rainbow glints  they rolled in a semicircle about the two men. Rynch stooped, then  Hume's fingers latched about his wrist, dragging his hand away from  the globe. It was only then that he realized that sharp action had  detached his attention from that ball he had wanted to take up.    \"Don't touch!\" Hume barked. \"And don't look at that too closely! Come  along!\" He pulled Rynch forward through the yet unclosed arc of the  globe circle.    Hume detoured around the feasting scavengers and brought Rynch with  him at a trot. They could hear behind them the plop and tinkle of more  globes. Glancing back Rynch saw one fall close to the bodies of the  water-cats.    \"Wait a minute!\" He pulled back against Hume's hold. Here was a chance  to see what effect that crystal had on the clawed carrion eater.    There was a change in the crystal: Yellow now, then red--red as the  few scraps of fur remaining on the rapidly disappearing body.    \"Look!\"    The pulsating carpet which had covered the dead feline ceased to move.  But towards that spot rolled two more of the globes, approaching the  scavengers. Now the clawed things were stirring, dropping away from  their prey. They spread out in a patch, moved purposefully forward.  Behind them, as guardians might head a flock, rolled three globes,  flushing scarlet, then more.    Hume's hand came up. From the cone tip of the ray tube spat a lance of  fire, to strike the middle crystal. The beam was reflected into the  block of scavengers. Scaled bodies, twisted, crisped, were ash. But  the crystal continued to roll at the same pace.    \"Move!\" Hume's other hand hit Rynch's shoulder, knocked him forward in  an impetuous shove which nearly took him off his feet. Both men began  to run.    \"What--what are those things?\" Rynch appealed between panting breaths.    \"I don't know--and I don't like their looks. They're between us and  the safari camp if we keep to the river--\"    \"Between us and the river now.\" Rynch saw that glittering swoop  through the air, marked the landing of a ball near the water's edge.    \"Might be trying to box us in. But that's not going to work.  See--ahead there where that log's caught between two rocks? Run out on  that when we reach there and take to the water. I don't think those  things can float and if they sink to the bottom that ought to fix them  as far as we are concerned.\"    Rynch ran, still holding the needler. He balanced along the drift log  Hume had pointed out and a jump sent him floundering in the brown  stream thigh deep. Hume joined him, his face grim.    \"Downstream--\"    Rynch looked. One shape--two--three--Clearly detailed where matching  vegetation gave them no covering camouflage, the watchers had come out  of the woods at last. A line of them were walking quietly and upright  towards the humans, their blue-green fuzz covering like a mist under  the direct rays of the sun. Quiet as they seemed at present, the  things out of the Jumalan forest were a picture of sheer brute  strength as they moved.    \"Let's get out of here--fast!\"    The men kept moving, and always after them padded that silent line of  green-blue, pushing them farther and farther away from the safari  camp, on towards the rising mountain peaks. Just as the globes had  shaken the scavengers loose from their meal and sent them marching on,  so were the humans being herded for some unknown purpose.    At least, once the march of the beasts began, they saw and heard no  more of the globes. And as they reached a curve in the river, Hume  stopped, swung around, stood studying the line of decorously pacing  animals.    \"We can pick them off with the needler or the ray.\"    The Hunter shook his head. \"You don't kill,\" he recited the credo of  his Guild, \"not until you are sure. There is a method behind this, and  method means intelligence.\"    Handling of X-tee creatures and peoples was a part of Guild training.  In spite of his devious game here on Jumala, Hume was Guild educated  and Rynch was willing to leave such decisions to him.    The other held out the ray tube. \"Take this, cover me, but don't use  it until I say so. Understand?\"    He waited only for Rynch's nod before he started, at a deliberate pace  which matched that of the beasts, back through the river shallows to  meet them. But that advancing line halted, stood waiting in silence.  Hume's hands went up, palm out, he spoke slowly in Basic-X-Tee clicks:    \"Friend.\" This was all Rynch could make out of that sing-song of  syllables Rynch knew to be a contact pattern.    The dark eye pits continued to stare. A light breeze ruffled the fuzz  covering of wide shoulders, long muscular arms. Not a head moved, not  one of those heavy, rounded jaws opened to emit any answering sound.  Hume halted. The silence was threatening, a portending atmosphere  spread from the alien things as might a tangible wave.    For perhaps two breaths they stood so, man facing alien. Then Hume  turned, walked back, his face set. Rynch offered him the ray tube.    \"Fight our way out?\"    \"Too late. Look!\"    Moving lines of blue-green coming down to the river. Not five or six  now--a dozen--twenty. There was a small trickle of moisture down the  side of the Hunter's brown face.    \"We're penned--except straight ahead.\"    \"But we're going to fight!\" Rynch protested.    \"No. Move on!\"          7      It was some time before Hume found what he wanted, an islet in  midstream lacking any growth and rising to a rough pinnacle. The sides  were seamed with crevices and caves which promised protection for  one's back in any desperate struggle. And they had discovered it none  too soon, for the late afternoon shadows were lengthening.    There had been no attack, just the trailing to herd the men to the  northeast. And Rynch had lost the first tight pinch of panic, though  he knew the folly of underestimating the unknown.    They climbed with unspoken consent, going clear to the top, where they  huddled together on a four-foot tableland. Hume unhooked his distance  lenses, but it was toward the rises of the mountains that he aimed  them, not along the back trail.    Rynch wriggled about, studied the river and its banks. The beasts  there were quiet, blue-green lumps, standing down on the river bank or  squatting in the grass.    \"Nothing.\" Hume lowered the lenses, held them before his broad chest  as he still watched the peaks.    \"What did you expect?\" Rynch snapped. He was hungry, but not hungry  enough to abandon the islet.    Hume laughed shortly. \"I don't know. Only I'm sure they are heading us  in that direction.\"    \"Look here,\" Rynch rounded on him. \"You know this planet, you've been  here before.\"    \"I was one of the survey team that approved it for the Guild.\"    \"Then you must have combed it pretty thoroughly. How is it that you  didn't know about them?\" He gestured to their pursuers.    \"That is what I would like to ask a few assorted experts right about  now,\" Hume returned. \"The verifiers registered no intelligent native  life here.\"    \"No native life.\" Rynch chewed that over, came up with the obvious  explanation. \"All right--so then maybe our blue-backed friends are  imported. Suppose someone's running a private business of his own here  and wants to get rid of visitors?\"    Hume looked thoughtful. \"No.\" He did not enlarge upon his negative.  Sitting down he pulled a cylinder container from a belt loop and shook  out four tablets, handing two to Rynch, mouthing the others.    \"Vita-blocks--good for twenty-four hours sustenance.\"    The iron rations depended upon by all exploring services did not have  the satisfying taste of real food. However Rynch swallowed them  dutifully before he descended with Hume to river level. The Hunter  splashed water from the stream into a depression in the rock and  dropped a pinch of clarifying powder into it.    \"With the dark,\" he announced, \"we might be able to get through their  lines.\"    \"You believe that?\"    Hume laughed. \"No--but one doesn't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19092"],[0,"The Adventures of Paddy Beaver (#9)"],[1,"something. What was it? Why a little  water-path led right up to the aspen-trees, and there, at the end of the  little water-path, was Paddy the Beaver hard at work. He was digging and  piling the earth on one side very neatly. In fact, he was making the  water-path longer. Jerry swam right up the little water-path to where  Paddy was working. \"Good morning, Cousin Paddy,\" said he. \"What are you  doing?\"    \"Oh,\" replied Paddy, \"Sammy Jay and I are building a canal.\"    Sammy Jay looked down at Jerry in triumph, and Jerry looked at Paddy as  if he thought that he was joking.    \"Sammy Jay? What's Sammy Jay got to do about it?\" demanded Jerry.    \"A whole lot,\" replied Paddy. \"You see, he keeps watch while I work. If  he didn't, I couldn't work, and there wouldn't be any canal. Old Man  Coyote has been trying to catch me, and I wouldn't dare work on shore if  it wasn't that I am sure that the sharpest eyes in the Green Forest are  watching for danger.\"    Sammy Jay looked very much pleased indeed and very proud. \"So you see it  takes both of us to make this canal; I dig while Sammy watches. So we  are building it together,\" concluded Paddy with a twinkle in his eyes.    \"I see,\" said Jerry slowly. Then he turned to Sammy Jay. \"I beg your  pardon, Sammy,\" said he. \"I do, indeed.\"    \"That's all right,\" replied Sammy airily. \"What do you think of  our canal?\"    \"I think it is wonderful,\" replied Jerry.    And indeed it was a very fine canal, straight, wide, and deep enough  for Paddy to swim in and float his logs out to the pond. Yes, indeed, it  was a very fine canal.          XXII    PADDY FINISHES HIS HARVEST      \"Sharp his tongue and sharp his eyes--    Sammy guards against surprise.    If 'twere not for Sammy Jay    I could do no work to-day.\"      When Sammy overheard Paddy the Beaver say that to Jerry Muskrat, it  made him swell up all over with pure pride. You see, Sammy is so used to  hearing bad things about himself that to hear something nice like that  pleased him immensely. He straightway forgot all the mean things he had  said to Paddy when he first saw him--how he had called him a thief  because he had cut the aspen-trees he needed. He forgot all this. He  forgot how Paddy had made him the laughing-stock of the Green Forest and  the Green Meadows by cutting down the very tree in which he had been  sitting. He forgot everything but that Paddy had trusted him to keep  watch and now was saying nice things about him. He made up his mind that  he would deserve all the nice things that Paddy could say, and he  thought that Paddy was the finest fellow in the world.    Jerry Muskrat looked doubtful. He didn't trust Sammy, and he took  care not to go far from the water when he heard that Old Man Coyote  had been hanging around. But Paddy worked away just as if he hadn't  a fear in the world.    \"The way to make people want to be trusted is to trust them,\" said he  to himself. \"If I show Sammy Jay that I don't really trust him, he will  think it is of no use to try and will give it up. But if I do trust him,  and he knows that I do, he'll be the best watchman in the Green Forest.\"    And this shows that Paddy the Beaver has a great deal of wisdom, for it  was just as he thought. Sammy was on hand bright and early every  morning. He made sure that Old Man Coyote was nowhere in the Green  Forest, and then he settled himself comfortably in the top of a tall  pine-tree where he could see all that was going on while Paddy the  Beaver worked.    Paddy had finished his canal, and a beautiful canal it was, leading  straight from his pond up to the aspen-trees. As soon as he had finished  it, he began to cut the trees. As soon as one was down he would cut it  into short lengths and roll them into the canal. Then he would float  them out to his pond and over to his storehouse. He took the larger  branches, on which there was sweet, tender bark, in the same way, for  Paddy is never wasteful.    After a while he went over to his storehouse, which, you know, was  nothing but a great pile of aspen-logs and branches in his pond close by  his house. He studied it very carefully. Then he swam back and climbed  up on the bank of his canal.    \"Mr. Jay,\" said he, \"I think our work is about finished.\"    \"What!\" cried Sammy, \"Aren't you going to cut the rest of those  aspen-trees?\"    \"No,\" replied Paddy. \"Enough is always enough, and I've got enough to  last me all winter. I want those trees for next year. Now I am fixed for  the winter. I think I'll take it easy for a while.\"    Sammy looked disappointed. You see he had just begun to learn that the  greatest pleasure in the world comes from doing things for other people.  For the first time since he could remember some one wanted him around  and it gave him such a good feeling down deep inside!"]]]
