No manufacturer could have  afforded to do this, and therefore the inference had been drawn that  the pottery was made purely for pleasure by some one who had an  abundance of leisure. Perhaps this very Bernard, the librarian, who  may have become interested in the art as a recreation, and done the  work in his idle hours.\"    \"What a funny thing to do as a pastime!\" exclaimed Theo.    \"No stranger than that now many persons take up metal work,  wood-carving, or other of the so-called arts and crafts for  diversion.\"    \"I suppose not,\" admitted Theo thoughtfully.    \"It certainly is possible such a thing might have happened even so  long ago as the time when the Henri Deux ware was made. History offers  us no aid in solving the puzzle, so we can only find an answer as best  we may. The ware, however, is unique, and there is no mistaking it.  Some of it bears the monogram of King Henry II, and that accounts for  the name by which the product passes. There are authorities that  assert the H does not stand for the king's name, but for Helene,  mistress of the Chateau d'Orion; others declare the king's monogram  was used merely to fix the date when the pottery was made. Hence you  will find some china collectors calling it Henri Deux ware, and others  speaking of it as Faience d'Orion; while still others refer to it as  Saint Porchaire. When examining it it is interesting to notice how  much finer the later pieces are than the earlier ones. Evidently  Bernard, if Bernard it was, improved a great deal with practice.\"    It was obvious that Mr. Croyden had no more to say about the elusive  Bernard, for he came to an abrupt stop.    Theo waited a second, and then remarked suggestively:    \"And Palissy?\"    \"Palissy? Oh, he was another matter altogether. What did you learn  about him when you were at school?\"    \"Not much, I'm afraid,\" responded Theo with a shrug. \"At least I do  not remember much of it now. The teacher told us that one day Palissy  saw an enameled cup of Saracen workmanship and that he was so anxious  to discover how the glaze on it was made that he worked years  experimenting; he even chopped up all his furniture as fuel for his  furnaces.\"    \"This is quite correct,\" smiled Mr. Croyden. \"I see you recall a good  deal. What you have told me are the main facts of the story. Palissy  did work fifteen years. He used every splinter of wood he could lay  hands on as fuel, and indeed burned up every particle of his household  furniture, until he had not a chair to sit upon. He spent every cent  he had, too, until he was so poor that he could scarcely feed his  family, and owed money to all his neighbors.\"    \"In the end did he find out how to make the enamel?\" came breathlessly  from Theo.    \"No, not that particular kind of enamel the Moors made in Spain. That  is the sad part of the story,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"He did, however,  find out by his experimenting how to get marvelous colored enamels of  another kind, and this was a very important discovery. He colored his  glazes before putting them over the clay, instead of using a white  enamel and then painting it as had previously been done everywhere. So  you see after all Palissy did a great deal for pottery-making, since  up to this time no one had ever thought of coloring the glaze  itself. He made many vases, platters, and covered dishes adorned with  designs in this colored enamel, often putting on the cover of a dish a  fruit or vegetable in relief, tinted in its natural colors. Much of  this work now can be seen in the museums of France; but it never  became a distinctive type of art. What we chiefly remember of Palissy  is his introduction into china-making of these hitherto unknown  colored enamels.\"    [Illustration: BURNED HIS CHAIRS \"HE USED EVERY SPLINTER OF WOOD\"]    \"What became of him?\" inquired Theo at last. \"Did he ever get any  more money?\"    \"He had a strange life,\" mused Mr. Croyden. \"He was a Huguenot, and  at that time the Catholic party was in power, and an edict went forth  that all Huguenots should be killed. Many of them fled into other  countries and thus escaped death. But Palissy refused to flee, and  because he was a man skilled in pottery-making, one of the things  France was eager to perfect, the king wanted to retain him in his  kingdom. Therefore he took Palissy under his protection, and for a  long time allowed him to work unmolested in a little building in the  grounds of the Tuileries. But by and by the Catholic adherents of the  king became too strong even for their royal master's control, and so  insistently did they clamor for Palissy's death that the king was  forced to send for the potter and beg him to renounce his Protestant  faith. Now by this time Palissy was a white-haired man of  eighty. Nevertheless when the king told him he must either recant or  lose his life he did not flinch. Fearlessly he clung to his religion.\"    \"Did they kill him?\"    \"No. Perhaps it was because the people did not dare displease the  king,\" answered Mr. Croyden. \"They did, however, imprison the old man  in the Bastille and there, after years of confinement, he wasted away  and died. It was probably only the influence of his royal patron that  prevented him from being murdered in the first place. Both the  Henri Deux ware and Palissy's colored enamels brought fame to  France. In 1800 at Nevers, where the blue and white ware similar to  Delft was made, there were twelve factories. Then there was a quaint  pottery made at Beauvais with the coats of arms of France and Brittany  upon it. At Rouen, too, an extensive pottery industry sprang up, and  it was to these factories that in 1713 Louis XIV, when forced to pay  his war debts, sent his silver service to be melted up and replaced by  a less expensive earthenware dinner set. Some pieces marked with the  fleur-de-lis, and probably remnants of this set, are to be found in  French museums. There were various other small potteries in different  parts of France: some at Marseilles, others at Moustiers and Nancy.  There were a number in Paris itself. All of these were making a more  or less fine variety of earthenware. But the time was not ripe for  France's greatest contribution to china-making. Of that you shall hear  some other day. Now have I not told you quite a long story?\"    \"A long one and a very good one,\" said Theo. \"I hope you'll tell me  another very soon.\"    \"Will you never have enough of all this chinaware?\"    Laughingly Theo shook his head.    \"I'd like you to keep right on until----\"    \"Until you are on your feet again,\" interrupted Mr. Croyden  teasingly. \"Then I suppose you will promptly run off and forget all  about it.\"    \"Not at all, sir!\" contradicted Theo. \"I was going to say I wished you  would keep on telling me about it until I got well and could go to see  some of these potteries and porcelains made.\"    \"Oh-ho! So you want to come to Trenton and steal my business away from  me, do you, you young rascal? We'll see about that.\"    With a broad smile Mr. Croyden rose and shaking his fist playfully at  Theo sauntered out the door.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER VI    FROM VASES TO DRAIN-PIPES      During the week that followed neither Dr. Swift nor Mr. Croyden took  any more long trips away from the camp. They went, to be sure, on  short fishing excursions, often being absent an entire morning or  afternoon; but they passed no nights away from Theo. The boy suspected  that his father's reason for this decision was because for the last  few days try as he would he had been unable to conceal how miserable  and uncomfortable he felt. Dr. Swift, however, would not own that this  was the cause of his loitering at home. He merely declared that when  the near-at-hand sport was so good it was foolish to tramp ten miles  to waylay some unwary and distant trout. And indeed this logic  appeared to be sound, for not once did the anglers return from one of  their brief tours that they did not bring with them baskets well lined  with yellow perch, trout, or land-loch salmon.    As a consequence the Doctor managed to keep very close watch of his  son, and Theo saw a great deal both of his father and Mr. Croyden.    The friendship of the latter for the sick lad was no empty pose.    He sincerely liked Theo--liked his manliness and his intelligence; his  brave attempt at unselfishness; his boyish love of fun.    Mr. Croyden was very fond of boys and, in fact, often betrayed the  circumstance that in reality he himself had never really grown up.    Accordingly he sought Theo out whenever he had leisure, and many a  happy hour did the two spend together.    One day when he chanced to be sitting beside the invalid's couch Theo  said:    \"You told me once that there were three famous potters in history, and  that Palissy was one of them; who were the others?\"    \"If I should tell you their names and nothing more about them it would  be only so much dry sawdust,\" was Mr. Croyden's reply. \"The only  reason they were great was because of what they did; and that is a  long story.\"    \"Too long to tell?\"    \"Too long to put in a nutshell.\"    \"Wouldn't you have time to tell me some of it now?\"    \"I might have time to tell you about one of the men, but not both; and  even were I to tell you about one of them, in order to make you  understand how truly great he was I should have to tell you much that  happened before he began his pottery-making,\" answered Mr. Croyden  slowly.    \"I shouldn't mind that at all,\" laughed Theo. \"The longer your  stories are the better I like them.\"    Mr. Croyden smiled.    \"Suppose, then, we begin,\" he said, \"and I will try before luncheon to  introduce you to our second great potter. But before I do this we must  go back a little that you may recall exactly where we left off.

Visitors will notice with interest a  fairly successful mural painting representing the resurrection, the  soldiers in armour being drawn with considerable spirit.    #Sylke Chantry# is in the north transept. Sylke was a person of  considerable importance in his day, and one who deserved and obtained no  little honour from his contemporaries. He administered the affairs of  the diocese as vicar-general during the absence of Bishop Courtenay, and  also during that of Bishop Fox. In 1499 he was made precentor, and held  that office till his death. The priests, grateful for the efforts he had  made to further their comfort, decided to keep his obit. The abbot and  convent of St. Mary of Cleeve, in Somersetshire, willing to show their  sense of obligation to him and Canon Moore, gave yearly to the Dean and  Chapter the sum of L6 13s. 4d. to be spent in celebrating their  anniversary. Sylke's tomb represents a very ghostly figure with the  epitaph, \"Sum quod eris, fueram quod es, pro me, precor, ora.\" The  chantry is in the style of the later Gothic, and is one of those \"final  touches\" to the cathedral Archdeacon Freeman esteems so happily imparted  to it. The ancient works of the thirteenth-century clock, upon the north  wall, have been placed in this chantry, the machinery being in motion  though it does not now work any part of the actual clock. The various  parts are of different dates; the oldest wheel has been working more or  less regularly for about 700 years. The dial represents the sun and moon  revolving round the earth in the centre, the varying phases of the moon  being indicated.    #St. Paul's Chapel# is on the east side of the north transept.  Attributed to the time of Marshall or his immediate predecessors. On the  tiles are the arms of Henry III.'s brother, Richard of Cornwall, who was  elected King of the Romans. It is used as a vestry for the lay choral  vicars.    #South Transept.#--Opening from the east wall is the #Chapel of St. John  the Baptist#. It corresponds with that of St. Paul in the north  transept. Some of the glass in the windows was placed there at the  restoration of 1870. The screen dividing it from the transept is  Oldham's work. The chapel is now furnished for private meditation and  prayer.    [Illustration: THE TRANSEPT, NORTH, SHOWING THE ORGAN AND CLOCK.                 The Photochrom. Co. Photo.]    #Chapel of the Holy Ghost.#--This, one of the most ancient parts of the  cathedral, lies between the south tower and chapter house. It occupies  the place of the passage known as the slype in monastic churches. The  plain stone barrel roof should be noted. It is now used as the  choristers' vestry.    The south transept contains a very interesting collection of monuments.    #Monuments in South Transept.#--On the east wall a shallow recess, in  which are set some fragments of sculpture, is traditionally described as  the tomb of Leofric, first Bishop of Exeter. Hoker thus tells the story:  \"This Leofricus died an. 1073, and was buried in the cemetery or  churchyard of his own church, under a simple or broken marble stone;  which place, by the since enlarging of his church is now within the  South Tower of the same, where of late, anno 1568, a new monument was  erected to the memory of so good, worthy & noble a personage, by the  industry of the writer hereof but at the charges of the Dean & Chapter.\"    In the corner at the south-east is the grave of Bishop John the  Chaunter, who died in 1191. He was for thirty years precentor of the  cathedral, and was consecrated bishop by Baldwin, Archbishop of  Canterbury, \"preacher and pilgrim of the Crusade,\" and a native of  Exeter. Bishop John assisted at the coronation of Richard I. He held the  see for six years.    Sir Peter Carew, whose mural tablet is a conspicuous feature, was buried  at Waterford in Ireland. He is one of the most distinguished members of  an ancient western family. On the Whitsunday of 1549, the village of  Samford Courtenay rose in revolt against the new prayer-book that Edward  VI. had ordered to be used in the churches, and the whole diocese  speedily followed the lead. The people swore that \"they would keep the  old and ancient religion as their forefathers before them had done.\" Sir  Gawain Carew, Sir Peter Carew, and Sir Thomas Dennis, the sheriff, were  busy in stemming the tide of rebellion. Efforts at compromise were  useless. The people bitterly demanded the old religion, and called the  new form of worship \"a Christian game,\" while the Cornishmen declared  that they, since \"certain of us understand no English, utterly refuse  the new English.\" Early in July the malcontents set siege to Exeter. The  wealth of the civic dignitaries stimulated the besiegers, who summoned  the city to surrender three times, vowing that \"they would enter by  force and take the spoil of it,\" were their demands refused. There was  discontent and plotting within the walls, and food gave out. Many were  eager to let in the rebels, and Hoker records that \"but two days before  the delivery of the city,\" the malcontents paraded the streets, crying  out: \"Come out these heretics and twopenny bookmen! Where be they! By  God's wounds and blood we will not be pinned in to serve their turn: we  will go out and have in our neighbours; they be honest good and godly  men.\" But the principal citizens, though nurtured in the old faith, held  out grimly for the king. The siege was raised by John, Lord Russell,  whom Sir Peter had hastily summoned from Hinton St. George, in  Somersetshire. Food was supplied to the city \"by the special industry  and travels of a thousand Welshmen under Sir William Herbert.\" Sir  Peter, on his arrival in London, was threatened with hanging by the Lord  Protector \"as having caused the commotion by burning the barns at  Crediton. He pleaded the king's letter under his hand and privy signet.\"  But he escaped with difficulty, though he obtained from Lord Russell the  lands of Winislacre as a reward. Later on he opposed Queen Mary's  marriage with the King of Naples, and as Fuller puts it: \"This active  gentleman had much adoe to expedite himself, and save his life, being  imprisoned for his compliance with Sir Thomas Wyate.\" He lived an  active, reckless life to the last, closing his career by some \"signal  service\" in Ireland. He was a brother of the Earl of Totnes. The  handsome Elizabethan monument is to Sir John Gilbert, brother of the  more famous Humphrey, and his wife, Elizabeth Chudleigh. He was one of  the merchant adventurers and a half-brother of Raleigh. His relations  with Exeter were very friendly, the merchants being keenly interested in  maritime discoveries, for they hoped in far away Asia to get a new  market for their cloth.    Heroes of later days are not forgotten in this gallant company, and a  tablet on the east wall commemorates the men of the 32nd Regiment  (Cornwall Light Infantry) who fell in the Indian Mutiny. The colours of  the regiment show the names of Waterloo and Lucknow.    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE NAVE IN THE LAST CENTURY                 (FROM A PRINT IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM).]    #The Choir Screen.#--This is the work of Bishop Stapledon, and was  probably completed about 1324. The Dean and Chapter anticipated the  admiration which this screen would cause in after ages, and we read that  they presented William Canon, the executor of the marble work, \"L4, out  of their courtesy.\" High above the screen, as we learn from the Fabric  Rolls, the rood with Mary and John rested on an iron bar.    [Illustration: CHOIR SCREEN, LOOKING N.E.                 (FROM BRITTON'S 'EXETER,' 1826).]    The paintings within the panels above the beautifully carved spandrils  have little interest or merit, though it is thought that they date from  the same period as the screen itself. It is difficult, however, to  believe that they can be so old, or that such good and bad work could  belong to the same period. James I. introduced into the foliage of the  spandrils the rose and thistle; but this uncalled-for emendation was  summarily removed in the year 1875. The side arches of the screen were  at one period filled up with thick walls, and two strong doors barred  the arch of entrance, but this was altered by the restorers in 1875.    #The Organ# was originally built by John Loosemore about 1665. In its  existing form it is an enlarged reconstruction by Messrs. Willis, the  old instrument being incorporated in it as a choir-organ. The organ  case, which was an elegant specimen of Renaissance woodwork, has also  undergone alteration and renovation.    #The Choir.#--If the chief glory with regard to the exterior of the  cathedral remains undoubtedly with the designer and builder of the great  towers, the choir, the work of Bytton and Stapledon, is no less  certainly the supreme glory of the interior. The Norman choir reached no  farther than the third bay, counting from the choir screen. Traces  recently discovered seem to prove that it had an apsidal termination.  Bishop Marshall, in completing Warelwast's work, added four bays and  destroyed the triple apse. It is also possible that, as the transition  period to Early English was in its birth, some of the vaulting was  pointed. Bytton converted the choir as left by Marshall into the  Decorated style, inspired to the work by the success which had attended  Quivil's efforts in the easternmost bay of the nave. The whole work--the  transformation of the choir with its aisles--took about fifteen years to  complete, the speed and skill with which it was accomplished being due  to the fact that the task was not entirely in the hands of one body of  labourers. It seems to have been divided into two portions, at which the  builders worked simultaneously. Admirable as Quivil's work in the nave"]]]
