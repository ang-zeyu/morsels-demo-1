But the  poison-tipped arrow Dalgard now handled, with confidence in its  complete efficiency, paralyzed within moments and killed in a  quarter-hour one of the scaled monstrosities.    \"Lair--\"    Dalgard did not need that warning thought from his companion. There  was no mistaking that sickly sweet stench born of decaying animal  matter, which was the betraying effluvium of a snake-devil's lair. He  turned to the right-hand wall and with a running leap reached its  broad top. The lane curved to end in an archway cut through another  wall, which was higher than Dalgard's head even when he stood on his  present elevation. But bands of ornamental patterning ran along the  taller barrier, and he was certain that it could be climbed. He  lowered a hand to Sssuri and hoisted the merman up to join him.    But Sssuri stood for a long moment looking ahead, and Dalgard knew  that the merman was disturbed, that the wall before them had some  terrifying meaning for the native Astran. So vivid was the impression  of what could only be termed horror--that Dalgard dared to ask a  question:    \"What is it?\"    The merman's yellow eyes turned from the wall to his companion. Behind  his hatred of this place there was another emotion Dalgard could not  read.    \"This is the place of sorrow, the place of separation. But _they_  paid--oh, how they paid--after that day when the fire fell from the  sky.\" His scaled and taloned feet moved in a little shuffling war  dance, and his spear spun and quivered in the sunlight, as Dalgard had  seen the spears of the mer-warriors move in the mock combats of their  unexplained, and to his kind unexplainable, rituals. \"Then did our  spears drink, and knives eat!\" Sssuri's fingers brushed the hilt of  the wicked blade swinging from his belt. \"Then did the People make  separations and sorrows for _them_! And it was accomplished that we  went forth into the sea to be no longer bond but free. And _they_ went  down into the darkness and were no more--\" In Dalgard's head the chant  of his friend skirled up in a paean of exultation. Sssuri shook his  spear at the wall.    \"No more the beast and the death,\" his thoughts swelled, a shout of  victory. \"For where are _they_ who sat and watched many deaths? _They_  are gone as the wave smashes itself upon the coast rocks and is no  more. But the People are free and never more shall Those Others put  bonds upon them! Therefore do I say that this is a place of nothing,  where evil has turned in upon itself and come to nothing. Just as  Those Others will come to nothing since their own evil will in the end  eat them up!\"    He strode forward along the wall until he came to the barrier,  seemingly oblivious of the carrion reek which told of a snake-devil's  den somewhere about. And he raised his arm high, bringing the point of  his spear gratingly along the carved surface. Nor did it seem to  Dalgard a futile gesture, for Sssuri lived and breathed, stood free  and armed in the city of his enemies--and the city was dead.    Together they climbed the barrier, and then Dalgard discovered that it  was the rim of an arena which must have seated close to a thousand in  the days of its use. It was a perfect oval in shape with tiers of  seats now forming a staircase down to the center, where was a section  ringed about by a series of archways. A high stone grille walled this  portion away from the seats as if to protect the spectators from what  might enter through those portals.    Dalgard noted all this only in passing, for the arena was occupied,  very much occupied. And he knew the occupiers only too well.    Three full-grown snake-devils were stretched at pulpy ease, their  filled bellies obscenely round, their long necks crowned with their  tiny heads flat on the sand as they napped. A pair of half-grown  monsters, not yet past the six-foot stage, tore at some indescribable  remnants of their elders' feasting, hissing at each other and aiming  vicious blows whenever they came within possible fighting distance.  Three more, not long out of their mothers' pouches scrabbled in the  earth about the sleeping adults.    \"A good catch,\" Dalgard signaled Sssuri, and the merman nodded.    They climbed down from seat to seat. This could not rightfully be  termed hunting when the quarry might be picked off so easily without  risk to the archer. But as Dalgard notched his first arrow, he sighted  something so surprising that he did not let the poisoned dart fly.    The nearest sleeping reptile which he had selected as his mark  stretched lazily without raising its head or opening its small eyes.  And the sun caught on a glistening band about its short foreleg just  beneath the joint of the taloned pawhands. No natural scales could  reflect the light with such a brilliant glare. It could be only one  thing--metal! A metal bracelet about the tearing arm of a snake-devil!  Dalgard looked at the other two sleepers. One was lying on its belly  with its forearms gathered under it so that he could not see if it,  also, were so equipped. But the other--yes, it was banded!    Sssuri stood at the grille, one hand on its stone divisions. His  surprise equaled Dalgard's. It was not in his experience either that  the untamed snake-devils, regarded by merman and human alike as so  dangerous as to be killed on sight, could be banded--as if they were  personal pets!    For a moment or two a wild idea crossed Dalgard's mind. How long was  the natural life span of a snake-devil? Until the coming of the  colonists they had been the undisputed rulers of the deserted  continent, stupid as they were, simply because of their strength and  ferocity. A twelve-foot, scale-armored monster, that could tear apart  a duocorn with ease, might not be successfully vanquished by any of  the fauna of Astra. And since the monsters did not venture into the  sea, contact between them and the mermen had been limited to casual  encounters at rare intervals. So, how long did a snake-devil live?  Were these creatures sprawled here in sleep ones that had known the  domination of Those Others--though the fall of the master race of  Astra must have occurred generations, hundreds of years in the past?    \"No,\" Sssuri's denial cut through that. \"The smaller one is not yet  full-grown. It lacks the second neck ring. Yet it is banded.\"    The merman was right. That unpleasant wattle of armored flesh which  necklaced the serpent throat of the devil Dalgard had picked as his  target was thin, not the thick roll of fat such as distinguished its  two companions. It was not fully adult, yet the band was plain to see  on the foreleg now stretched to its full length as the sun bored down  to supply the heavy heat the snake-devils relished next to food.    \"Then--\" Dalgard did not like to think of what might be the answer to  that \"then.\"    Sssuri shrugged. \"It is plain that these are not wild roamers. They  are here for a purpose. And that purpose--\" Suddenly his arm shot out  so that his fingers protruded through the slits in the stone grille.  \"See?\"    Dalgard had already seen, in seeing he knew hot and terrible anger.  Out of the filthy mess in which the snake-devils wallowed, something  had rolled, perhaps thrown about in play by the unspeakable offspring.  A skull, dried scraps of fur and flesh still clinging to it, stared  hollow-eyed up at them. At least one merman had fallen prey to the  nightmares who ruled the arena.    Sssuri hissed and the red rage in his mind was plain to Dalgard. \"Once  more they deal death here--\" His eyes went from the skull to the  monsters. \"Kill!\" The command was imperative and sharp.    Dalgard had qualified as a master bowman before he had first gone  roving. And the killing of snake-devils was a task which had been set  every colonist since their first brush with the creatures.    He snapped the cap off the glass splinter point, designed to pin and  then break off in the hide so that any clawing foot which tore out an  arrow could not rid the victim of the poisonous head. The archer's  mark was under the throat where the scales were soft and there was a  chance of piercing the skin with the first shot.    The growls of the two feeding youngsters covered the snap of the bow  cord as Dalgard shot. And he did not miss. The brilliant scarlet  feather of the arrow quivered in the baggy roll of flesh.    With a scream which tore at the human's eardrums, the snake-devil  reared to its hind feet. It made a tearing motion with the banded  forearm which scraped across the back of one of its companions. And  then it fell back to the blood-stained sand, limp, a greenish foam  drooling from its fangs.    As the monster that the dead devil had raked roused, Dalgard had his  chance for another good mark. And the second scarlet shaft sped  straight to the target.    But the third creature which had been sleeping belly down on the sand  presented only its armored back, a hopeless surface for an arrow to  pierce. It had opened its eyes and was watching the now motionless  bodies of its fellows. But it showed no disposition to move. It was  almost as if it somehow understood that as long as it remained in its  present position it was safe.    \"The small ones--\"    Dalgard needed no prompting. He picked off easily enough the two  half-grown ones. The infants were another problem. Far less sluggish  than their huge elders they sensed that they were in danger and fled.  One took refuge in the pouch of its now-dead parent, and the others  moved so fast that Dalgard found them difficult targets. He killed one  which had almost reached an archway and at length nicked the second in  the foot, knowing that, while the poison would be slower in acting, it  would be as sure.    Through all of this the third"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I. (of X.)

He was forced to fly from Pisa, we are told by the  historian, and we are assured at the same time that Galileo, who had  always been far, far ahead of all competitors in other things, was  equally successful as a fleer.    Galileo received but sixty scudi per year as his salary while at Pisa,  and a part of that he took in town orders, worth only sixty cents on the  scudi.          WANTED--A COOK    BY ALAN DALE      There was a ring at the front door-bell. Letitia, wrought-up, nervously  clutched my arm. For a moment a sort of paralysis seized me. Then,  alertly as a young calf, I bounded toward the door, hope aroused, and  expectation keen. It was rather dark in the outside hall, and I could  not quite perceive the nature of our visitor. But I soon gladly realized  that it was something feminine, and as I held the door open, a thin,  small, soiled wisp of a woman glided in and smiled at me.    \"_Talar ni svensk?_\" she asked, but I had no idea what she meant. She  may have been impertinent, or even rude, or perhaps improper, but she  looked as though she might be a domestic, and I led her gently,  reverently, to Letitia in the drawing-room. I smiled back at her, in a  wild endeavor to be sympathetic. I would have anointed her, or bathed  her feet, or plied her with figs and dates, or have done anything that  any nationality craves as a welcome. As the front door closed I heaved a  sigh of relief. Here was probably the quintessence of five  advertisements. Out of the mountain crept a mouse, and quite a little  mouse, too!    \"_Talar ni svensk?_\" proved to be nothing more outrageous than \"Do you  speak Swedish?\" My astute little wife discovered this intuitively. I  left them together, my mental excuse being that women understand each  other and that a man is unnecessary, under the circumstances. I had  some misgivings on the subject of Letitia and _svensk_, but the  universal language of femininity is not without its uses. I devoutly  hoped that Letitia would be able to come to terms, as the mere idea of a  cook who couldn't excoriate us in English was, at that moment,  delightful. At the end of a quarter of an hour I strolled back to the  drawing-room. Letitia was smiling and the hand-maiden sat grim and  uninspired.    \"I've engaged her, Archie,\" said Letitia. \"She knows nothing, as she has  told me in the few words of English that she has picked up, but--you  remember what Aunt Julia said about a clean slate.\"    I gazed at the maiden, and reflected that while the term \"slate\" might  be perfectly correct, the adjective seemed a bit over-enthusiastic. She  was decidely soiled, this quintessence of a quintette of advertisements.  I said nothing, anxious not to dampen Letitia's elation.    \"She has no references,\" continued my wife, \"as she has never been out  before. She is just a simple little Stockholm girl. I like her face  immensely, Archie--immensely. She is willing to begin at once, which  shows that she is eager, and consequently likely to suit us. Wait for  me, Archie, while I take her to the kitchen. _Kom_, Gerda.\"    Exactly why Letitia couldn't say \"Come, Gerda,\" seemed strange. She  probably thought that _Kom_ must be Swedish, and that it sounded well.  She certainly invented _Kom_ on the spur of the Scandinavian moment, and  I learned afterward that it was correct. My inspired Letitia! Still, in  spite of all, my opinion is that \"Come, Gerda,\" would have done just as  well.    \"Isn't it delightful?\" cried Letitia, when she joined me later. \"I am  really enthusiastic at the idea of a Swedish girl. I adore Scandinavia,  Archie. It always makes me think of Ibsen. Perhaps Gerda Lyberg--that's  her name--will be as interesting as Hedda Gabler, and Mrs. Alving, and  Nora, and all those lovely complex Ibsen creatures.\"    \"They were Norwegians, dear,\" I said gently, anxious not to shatter  illusions; \"the Ibsen plays deal with Christiania, not with Stockholm.\"    \"But they are so near,\" declared Letitia, amiable and seraphic once  more. \"Somehow or other, I invariably mix up Norway and Sweden and  Denmark. I know I shall always look upon Gerda as an Ibsen girl, who has  come here to 'live her life,' or 'work out her inheritance.' Perhaps,  dear, she has some interesting internal disease, or a maggoty brain.  Don't you think, Archie, that the Ibsen inheritances are always most  fascinating? A bit morbid, but surely fascinating.\"    \"I prefer a healthy cook, Letitia,\" I said meditatively, \"somebody  willing to interest herself in our inheritance, rather than in her own.\"    \"I don't mind what you say now,\" she pouted, \"I am not to be put down by  clamor. We really have a cook at last, and I feel more lenient toward  you, Archie. Of course I was only joking when I suggested the Ibsen  diseases. Gerda Lyberg may have inherited from her ancestors something  quite nice and attractive.\"    \"Then you mustn't look upon her as Ibsen, Letitia,\" I protested. \"The  Ibsen people never inherit nice things. Their ancestors always bequeath  nasty ones. That is where their consistency comes in. They are  receptacles for horrors. Personally, if you'll excuse my flippancy, I  prefer Norwegian anchovies to Norwegian heroines. It is a mere matter of  opinion.\"    \"I'm ashamed of you,\" retorted Letitia defiantly. \"You talk like some of  the wretchedly frivolous criticisms, so called, that men like Acton  Davies and Alan Dale inflict upon the long-suffering public. They never  amuse me. Ibsen may make his heroines the recipients of ugly legacies,  but he has never yet cursed them with the odious incubus known as 'a  sense of humor.' The people with a sense of humor have something in  their brains worse than maggots. We'll drop the subject, Archie. I'm  going to learn Swedish. Before Gerda Lyberg has been with us a month I  intend to be able to talk fluently. It will be most useful. Next time we  go to Europe we'll take in Sweden, and I'll do the piloting. I am going  to buy some Swedish books, and study. Won't it be jolly? And just think  how melancholy we were this morning, you and I, looking out of that  window, and trying to materialize cooks. Wasn't it funny, Archie? What  amusing experiences we shall be able to chronicle, later on!\"    Letitia babbled on like half a dozen brooks, and thinking up a gentle  parody, in the shape of, \"cooks may come, and men may go,\" I decided to  leave my household gods for the bread-earning contest down-town. I could  not feel quite as sanguine as Letitia, who seemed to have forgotten the  dismal results of the advertisement--just one little puny Swedish  result. I should have preferred to make a choice. Letitia was as pleased  with Gerda Lyberg as though she had been a selection instead of a  that-or-nothing.    If somebody had dramatized Gerda Lyberg's initial dinner, it would  probably have been considered exceedingly droll. As a serious episode,  however, its humor, to my mind, lacked spontaneity. Letitia had asked  her to cook us a little Swedish meal, so that we could get some idea of  Stockholm life, in which, for some reason or other, we were supposed to  be deeply interested. Unfortunately I was extremely hungry, and had  carefully avoided luncheon in order to give my appetite a chance. We  sat down to a huge bowl of cold, greasy soup, in which enormous lumps of  meat swam, as though for their life, awaiting rescue at the prongs of a  fork. In addition to this epicurean dish was a teeming plate of  water-soaked potatoes, delicately boiled. That was all. Letitia said  that it was Swedish, and the most annoying part of the entertainment was  that I was alone in my critical disapprobation. Letitia was so engrossed  with a little Swedish conversation book that she brought to table that  she forgot the mere material question of food--forgot everything but the  horrible jargon she was studying, and the soiled, wisp-like maiden, who  looked more unlike a clean slate than ever.    \"What shall I say to her, Archie?\" asked Letitia, turning over the pages  of her book, as I tried to rescue a block of meat from the cold fat in  which it lurked. \"Here is a chapter on dinner. 'I am very hungry,' '_Jag  aer myckel hungrig_.' Rather pretty, isn't it? Hark at this: '_Kypare gif  mig matsedeln och vinlistan._' That means: 'Waiter, give me the bill of  fare, and the list of wines.'\"    \"Don't,\" I cried; \"don't. This woman doesn't know what dining means.  Look out a chapter on feeding.\"    Letitia was perfectly unruffled. She paid no attention to me whatsoever.  She was fascinated with the slovenly girl, who stood around and gaped at  her Swedish.    \"Gerda,\" said Letitia, with her eyes on the book, \"_Gif mir apven senap  och naegra potaeter_.\" And then, as Miss Lyberg dived for the drowned  potatoes, Letitia exclaimed in an ecstasy of joy, \"She understands,  Archie, she understands. I feel I am going to be a great success. _Jag  tackar_, Gerda. That means 'I thank you,' _Jag tackar_. See if you can  say it, Archie. Just try, dear, to oblige me. _Jag tackar._ Now, that's  a good boy, _jag tackar_.\"    \"I won't,\" I declared spitefully. \"No _jag tackar_ing for a parody like  this, Letitia. You don't seem to realize that I'm hungry. Honestly, I  prefer a delicatessen dinner to this.\"    \"'Pray, give me a piece of venison,'\" read Letitia, absolutely  disregarding my mood. \"'_Var god och gif mig ett stycke vildt._' It is  almost intelligible, isn't it, dear? '_Ni aeter icke_': you do not eat.\"    \"I can't,\" I asserted mournfully, anxious to gain Letitia's sympathy.    It was not forthcoming. Letitia's eyes were fastened on Gerda, and I  could not help noting on the woman's face an expression of scorn. I felt  certain of it. She appeared to regard my wife as a sort of irresponsible  freak, and I was vexed to think that Letitia should make such an  exhibition of herself, and countenance the alleged meal that was"]]]
