The English had taken with them no firearms,  but each man carried his bow and arrows, and with these they shot  fast and hard at the Spaniards, and silenced their fire.    At this moment, however, it happened, sadly for the success of the  enterprise, that a ball struck Captain Drake, and inflicted a  serious wound. Ned was standing near him, and observed him stagger.    \"Are you hit, sir?\" he asked anxiously.    \"Tush, my boy,\" he replied, \"it is a scratch; say nothing of it.    \"Now, forward to the Treasury. The town is in your hands, my lads.  It only remains to you to sack as much treasure as you can carry;  but remember, do not lose your discipline, and keep together. If we  straggle, we are lost.    \"Now, light at once the torches which you have brought with you,  and shout aloud to the inhabitants, you that can speak Spanish,  that if any more resistance is offered, we will burn the whole town  to the ground.\"    This threat mightily alarmed the inhabitants, and the firing ceased  altogether; for as these were not regular soldiers, and knew that  the object of the English attack was to plunder the public  treasuries, rather than private property, the townsmen readily  deemed it to their interest to hold aloof, rather than to bring  upon their city and themselves so grievous a calamity as that  threatened by the English.    In the advance, two or three Spaniards had fallen into the hands of  the men and, these being threatened with instant death if they  hesitated, at once led the way to the governor's house, where the  silver, brought down on mules from Panama, was stored. A party were  placed at the door of this building, and Captain Drake, with the  rest, entered.    The governor had fled, with his attendants. The house was richly  furnished; full of silk hangings, of vessels of gold and silver,  and of all kinds of beautiful things. These, however, attracted  little attention from the English, although Ned and his young  comrades marveled much. Never had they seen, in England, anything  approaching to the wealth and beauty of this furnishing. It seemed  to them, indeed, as if they had entered one of the houses of the  magicians and enchanters, of whom they had read in books during  their childhood.    Captain Drake, however, passed through these gorgeous rooms with  scarce a glance and, led by the Spaniards, descended some steps  into a vast cellar.    A cry of astonishment and admiration burst from the whole party, as  they entered this treasury. Here, piled up twelve feet high, lay a  mighty mass of bars of silver, carefully packed. This heap was no  less than 70 feet long and 10 feet wide, and the bars each weighed  from 35 to 40 pounds.    \"My lads,\" Captain Drake said, \"here is money enough to make us all  rich for our lives; but we must leave it for the present, and make  for the Treasury House, which is as full of gold and of precious  stones as this is of silver.\"    The men followed Captain Drake and his brother, feeling quite  astonished, and almost stupefied at the sight of this pile of  silver; but they felt, moreover, the impossibility of their  carrying off so vast a weight, unless the town were completely in  their hands.    This, indeed, was very far from being the case, for the whole town  was now rising. The troops, who had at the first panic fled, were  now being brought forward; and as the day lightened, the Spaniards,  sorely ashamed that so small a body of men should have made  themselves masters of so great and rich a city, were plucking up  heart and preparing to attack them.    Ill was it, then, for the success of the adventure, that Captain  Francis had suffered so heavy a wound in the marketplace. Up to  this time he had kept bravely on, and none except Ned, all being  full of the prospect of vast plunder, had noticed his pale face, or  seen the blood which streamed down from him, and marked every  footstep as he went; but nature could now do no more and, with his  body well nigh drained of all its blood, he suddenly fell down  fainting.    Great was the cry that rose from the men, as they saw the admiral  thus fall. Hastily gathering round him, they lifted his body from  the ground, and shuddered at seeing how great a pool of blood was  gathered where he had been standing. It seemed almost as if, with  the fall of their captain, the courage which had animated these  men, and would animate them again in fighting against ever so great  odds, had for the moment deserted them.    In spite of the orders of Captain John, that four or five should  carry his brother to the boats; and that the rest should seize,  without delay, the treasures of gold and diamonds in the Treasury,  and carry off as great a weight as they might bear, none paid  attention. They gathered round the body of Captain Francis and,  lifting him on their shoulders, they hurried to the boats, careless  of the promised treasures, and thinking only to escape, and bear  with them their beloved commander from the forces of the Spaniards;  who, as they saw the party fall back, with great shouting fell upon  them, shooting hotly.    The swoon of the admiral had lasted but a few moments. As cordial  was poured down his throat he opened his eyes and, seeing what the  men were minded to do, protested with all his force against their  retreat. His words, however, had no weight with them and, in spite  of his resistance, they carried him down to the battery; and there,  placing him in a pinnace, the whole took to their boats, and rowed  on board ship.    Wonderful to relate, although many were wounded, but one man, and  he Giles Taunton the armorer, was killed in this attack upon the  great city, in which they only missed making themselves masters of  one of the greatest treasures upon earth by the accident of their  commander fainting, at a critical moment, and to the men being  seized by an unaccountable panic. Some of the crew had, indeed,  carried off certain plunder, which they had snatched in passing  through the governor's house, and in such short searches as they  had been able to make in private dwellings; but the men, in  general, had been so struck with amazement and sorrow at the sight  of their general's wound, that although this wealth was virtually  at their mercy, they put off with him without casting a thought  upon what they were leaving behind.    The boats now rowed without pausing to the isle, which they called  the Isle of Victuals; and there they stayed two days, nursing their  wounds, and supporting themselves with poultry, of which there was  a great abundance found in the island, and with vegetables and  fruits from the gardens. There was great joy among them when it was  found that Captain Drake's wound, although severe enough, was yet  not likely to imperil his life; and that it was loss of blood,  alone, which had caused him to faint. At this news the men all took  heart, and rejoiced so exceedingly that a stranger would have  supposed that they had attained some great victory, rather than  have come out unsuccessful from an adventure which promised to make  each man wealthy.    Upon the second day after their arrival at the Isle of Victuals,  they saw a boat rowing out from the direction of Nombre de Dios. As  they knew that there was no fleet in that harbor which would  venture to attack them, the English had no fear of the approaching  boat; although, indeed, they wondered much what message could have  been sent them. On board the boat was an hidalgo, or Spanish noble,  who was rowed by four negroes. He said that he had come from the  mainland to make inquiries as to the gallant men who had performed  so great a feat, and that he cherished no malice, whatever, against  them. He wished to know whether the Captain Drake who commanded  them was the same who had been there before, and especially did he  inquire whether the arrows used by the English were poisoned; for,  he said, great fear and alarm reigned in the town, many believing  that all who had been struck by the English shafts would certainly  die.    Upon this head he was soon reassured; and the English were, indeed,  mightily indignant at its being supposed that they would use such  cowardly weapons as poisoned arrows.    Then the hidalgo inquired why the English had so suddenly retreated  from the town, when it was in their hands, and why they had  abstained from carrying off the three hundred and sixty tons of  silver which lay at the governor's house, and the still greater  value of gold in the treasure house--the gold, indeed, being far  more valuable than the silver, insomuch as it was more portable.  The answers to all these questions were freely given, for in those  days there was a curious mixture of peace and war, of desperate  violence and of great courtesy, between combatants; and whereas,  now, an enemy arriving with a view merely to obtain information  would be roughly treated, in those days he was courteously  entertained, and his questions as freely answered as if he had been  a friend and ally.    When he heard of the wound of Captain Drake he expressed great  sorrow; and, after many compliments were exchanged, he returned to  Nombre de Dios; while, the next day, Captain Drake and the English  rowed away to the Isle of Pines, where Captain Rause was remaining  in charge of the ships. He was mightily glad to see them return, as  were their comrades who had remained; for their long absence had  caused great fear and anxiety, as it was thought that Captain Drake  must have fallen into some ambuscade, and that ill had come to the  party.    Although there was some regret at the thought that the chance of  gaining such vast booty had been missed, yet the joy at the safe  return overpowered this feeling; and, for a day or two, the crews  feasted merrily and held festival. Captain Rause then determined to  continue the adventure no further, but to separate with his ship  and men from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#9)"],[1,"iendly, wise, and devoted animal.    When the King decided to have him sent away for a while, for he feared  that his son was getting a touch of Poldo's barky manner of speaking,  from too close an association, the little Prince became really ill from  grief, and the King was forced to alter his decision.    During his imprisonment in the tower, in spite of all precautions, the  Prince sneezed three times. At the first sneeze, all the dogs in the  kingdom except Poldo changed into cats, and all the cats into dogs.  Though this was not a serious trouble, the change was certainly  inconvenient. All the dog-cats came out meowing at people as the dogs  used to bark at them, and they chased people down the street; the  cat-dogs, on the other hand, stayed in the kitchen under the stove, and  watched for mice in the pantry. Great St. Bernards might be seen licking  their paws and rubbing them over their foreheads, and fat, old  cat-lap-dogs used to try to purr.    At the second sneeze, all the elderly gentlemen over seventy changed  into elm trees, a proceeding that caused a terrible lot of trouble.    At the third sneeze, all the people in the pictures at the Art Museum  became alive, and for a week the soldiers of the royal guard spent most  of their time rescuing poor, bewildered fauns, satyrs, nymphs, Roman  senators, and long dead celebrities and historical personages from the  worst destitution. The King finally had to build a special castle for  them.    As the Prince's twenty-first birthday drew near, he began to feel very  sad at the idea of having to stay shut up in the tower all his life.  Though he was a very brave and very manly young man, he lay down on his  couch and wept in sorrow.    Suddenly, standing with his forepaws on the coverlet, \"Why do you weep,  dear master?\" said the little dog.    \"At my fate,\" replied the poor Prince. \"I cannot bear to think that I  may have to spend all my days in this tower, and never see the great  wide world.\"    The poodle was silent for a few minutes. At length he said, \"Dear Prince  Rolandor, do not give up hope. Have you ever thought of consulting my  old master, the Giant of the North Pole? He has a large chest in his  palace full of secrets which the winds have overheard, and perhaps the  key to Malvolia's spell is among them. If you will have a warm fur coat  and four fur boots made for me, I will go to the Giant and ask him.\"    The Prince gave his consent, and on the next day the royal tailor made  the poodle a magnificent sealskin coat and four splendid fur-lined  boots. Then the King wished him good speed, the Queen cried over him,  and the Prince, who could see from his high tower every corner of the  kingdom, watched him till he disappeared over the hills and far away.    Straight north the poodle ran. Soon he had left the fertile plains  behind him, and entered great, black pine forests where never a road was  to be seen. The cold wind howled through the trees, and at night the  brilliant stars sparkled over the dark and waving branches. Hungry  wolves and savage bears often pursued him, but somehow he always managed  to escape them all. At the end of the forest he found the frozen ocean  lit by the shuddering light of the aurora, flashing in a great fan from  east to west. Past white-tusked walruses and sleepy penguins he flew,  till on the eleventh day he saw the green, icy pinnacles of the Giant's  palace against the waving curtain of the Polar lights. On the evening of  the twelfth day he entered the castle.    The Giant of the North Pole was a tall, strong, yellow-haired fellow  wearing a crown of ice and a great sweeping mantle made from the white  fur of the polar bear. His servants were the Gusts,--strange, supple,  shadowy creatures moving quickly  to and fro,--and his courtiers were  the whirlwinds and the storms. The Giant's wife sat by his side; she had  dark hair and eyes of icy, burning blue.    \"Welcome, little Poldo,\" said the Giant; and his voice sounded like the  wind in the treetops; \"what seek you here?\"    \"I seek some words of the Fairy Malvolia which were carried away by the  northeast wind at Prince Rolandor's christening,\" replied the poodle.    \"Whew, oo-oo,\" whistled the Giant of the North Pole. \"If I have them,  the words are yours.\"    He summoned two Gusts to bring forth the chest of secrets. It was made  of black stone; and edged with diamonds of ice. In it were stored all  the mysteries which the wind had ever overheard; there were secrets,  confessions, vows, merry laughs, and simple words. And sure enough, in  the corner of the chest lay the rest of Malvolia's spell--a row of  little, old-fashioned, dusty words; the words: \"Until he finds someone  brave enough to marry him.\"    So the good poodle learned the words by heart, thanked the Giant, and  hurried home with the message. When he came to the King's palace, he  ran, barking with joy, right into the King's own room. There he saw the  unhappy parents.    \"Have you found the last of the sentence?\" cried the Queen.    \"Yes,\" said Poldo. \"The spell will end when the prince marries.\"    That very evening the King and the Queen sent forth ambassadors to ask  for the hand of the loveliest princess of all Fairyland, Princess Adatha  of the Adamant Mountains. But so afraid was Adatha of being turned into  something else, that she refused the offer.    The King and the Queen then made a request for the hand of Princess  Alicia of the Crystal Lakes. But Alicia also was afraid of being turned  into something else, and she too refused the alliance. So did the  Princess of the Golden Coasts, the Princess of the Seven Cities, and  many others. Finally the only princess left in all Fairyland was a  princess who herself lay under an enchantment. A jealous witch had  turned her golden hair bright blue, and given her a nose a foot long.  This unhappy maiden was the only princess willing to accept poor  Rolandor.    The wedding day arrived. The Prince, though perhaps a little pale from  his confined life, looked very handsome, and led his ugly bride to the  altar like a man. Just exactly as the marriage ceremony was half over, a  spasm contorted the muscles of the Prince's face; the poor young man  felt strongly inclined to sneeze. Though he could be seen making heroic  efforts to control the impulse, the audience got very nervous and  panicky.    All was in vain! The Prince sneezed, \"Ker choo!\" A terrific clap of  thunder rent the air, and everybody looked about to see what had  happened.    The effect of the sneeze was an odd one. As it had occurred exactly at  the moment when the Prince was half-married, the spell had reacted upon  itself. \"Just like a kick from a gun,\" Dr. Pill said next day.    The cats became dogs again, and the dogs became cats; the elm trees  became cross, elderly gentlemen looking for their families; the poor,  excited Roman senators, fauns, nymphs, satyrs, celebrities and  historical personages, went back to their pictures; and to cap the  climax, the ugly bride became once more her sweet and lovely self.    While everybody was cheering, who should walk out of the sacristy but  the Court Astrologer! An instant later, he had fallen into the  affectionate arms of the faithful wife who had wound him up for  twenty-one years.    After the wedding reception, the Prince and his bride went on a  honeymoon to the Enchanted Islands. As for Poldo the poodle, he was  created Prime Minister and lived to a fine old age.             MARIANNA    [Illustration: Young girl sitting on tree trunk; a small bird is perched  on her left hand; a small bottle is fastened to her belt.]      Once upon a time a wicked nobleman rose in rebellion against his  rightful king, and taking the royal forces by surprise, defeated them  and seized the kingdom. The dethroned King, who had been severely  wounded in battle, was cast in prison, where he soon died; but his  widow, the Queen, managed to escape from the palace before the usurper  could lay hands upon her.    Into the dark forest which lay behind the palace ran the Queen, holding  her baby daughter in her arms. It was winter time, and a heavy snow had  hidden the foot-paths and the roads. Presently the Queen realized that  she was lost. All afternoon, however, she trudged bravely on through the  silence and the cold, her heart sinking as mile after mile revealed no  sign of a house or a shelter.    But late in the afternoon, when the red shield of the sun could scarcely  be seen through the tangle of the wild wood-branches, she perceived a  light coming from a little grove of cedars by the shore of a frozen  lake. The Queen made her way toward this light, and discovered a little  thatched hut in the silent wood; it was the house of one of the dwarfs  of the forest. The dwarf took pity on the Queen, but his efforts were  vain, for the poor woman was so weak and exhausted that she died without  telling the dwarf anything about herself or the child she carried.    So the little dwarf, who was a good, kind old fellow, brought the little  girl up as if she were his own child. His brother, the dwarf of the  mountain, made her the prettiest red-leather shoes, and his cousins, the  dwarfs of the pines, made the little girl dresses from cloth woven on  fairy looms.    Now, on the night her mother brought her to the hut, the little girl was  wearing a golden heart-shaped locket, with a crown and the letter M upon  it in diamonds. So the dwarf called the little girl Marianna.    Seventeen years passed, and Marianna grew to be quite the loveliest lass  in all the world. Her hair was as black as the raven's wing, her eyes  were as blue as the midsummer sea, and her skin was fair as the petal of  a rose. One spring morning a little yellow bird flew into the cedar  grove, and gave the dwarf a letter which it held in its beak.    The dwarf read the letter, and said to Marianna, \"Little Marianna, the  Emperor of the Elves has bidden me come to the"]]]
