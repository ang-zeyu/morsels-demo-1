According to White, the President  had apparently never considered the use of integrated units, but after  some discussion he seemed to accept the suggestion that the Army could  assign black regiments or batteries alongside white units and from  there \"the Army could 'back into' the formation of units without  segregation.\"[1-34]                       [Footnote 1-33: Memo, White for Roy Wilkins et al.,                     Oct 39; Ltr, Houston to White, Oct 39; Memo,                     Wilkins to White, 23 Oct 39.

Although the policy announced by  the White House subsequent to the meeting contained concessions  regarding the employment and distribution of Negroes in the services,  it did not provide for integrated units. The wording of the press  release on the conference implied, moreover, that the administration's  entire program had been approved by White and the others. To have  their names associated with any endorsement of segregation was  particularly infuriating to these civil rights leaders, who  immediately protested to the President.[1-35] The White House later  publicly absolved the leaders of any such endorsement, and Press  Secretary Early was forced to retract the \"damaging impression\" that  the leaders had in any way endorsed segregation. The President later  assured White, Randolph, and Hill that further policy changes would be  made to insure fair treatment for Negroes.[1-36]                       [Footnote 1-35: Ltr, White to Stephen Early, 21 Oct                     40.

The organization encountered  opposition at first when some black leaders were willing to accept  segregated units as the price for obtaining the formation of more  all-black divisions. The NAACP stood firm, however, and demanded at  its annual convention in 1941 an immediate end to segregation.    In a related move symbolizing the growing unity behind the campaign to  integrate the military, the leaders of the March on Washington  Movement, a group of black activists under A. Philip Randolph,     (p. 016)  specifically demanded the end of segregation in the Army and Navy. The  movement was the first since the days of Marcus Garvey to involve the  black masses; in fact Negroes from every social and economic class  rallied behind Randolph, ready to demonstrate for equal treatment and  opportunity. Although some black papers objected to the movement's  militancy, the major civil rights organization showed no such hesitancy.  Roy Wilkins, a leader of the NAACP, later claimed that Randolph could  supply only about 9,000 potential demonstrators and that the NAACP had  provided the bulk of the movement's participants.[1-37]                       [Footnote 1-37: Roy Wilkins Oral History Interview,                     Columbia University Oral History Collection. See                     also A. Philip Randolph, \"Why Should We March,\"                     _Survey Graphic_ 31 (November 1942), as reprinted                     in John H. Franklin and Isidore Starr, eds., _The                     Negro in Twentieth Century America_ (New York:                     Random House, 1967).]    Although Randolph was primarily interested in fair employment  practices, the NAACP had been concerned with the status of black  servicemen since World War I. Reflecting the degree of NAACP support,  march organizers included a discussion of segregation in the services  when they talked with President Roosevelt in June 1941. Randolph and  the others proposed ways to abolish the separate racial units in each  service, charging that integration was being frustrated by prejudiced  senior military officials.[1-38]                       [Footnote 1-38: White, _A Man Called White_, pp.                     190-93.]    The President's meeting with the march leaders won the administration  a reprieve from the threat of a mass civil rights demonstration in the  nation's capital, but at the price of promising substantial reform in  minority hiring for defense industries and the creation of a federal  body, the Fair Employment Practices Committee, to coordinate the  reform. While it prompted no similar reform in the racial policies of  the armed forces, the March on Washington Movement was nevertheless a  significant milestone in the services' racial history.[1-39] It signaled  the beginning of a popularly based campaign against segregation in the  armed forces in which all the major civil rights organizations, their  allies in Congress and the press, and many in the black community  would hammer away on a single theme: segregation is unacceptable in a  democratic society and hypocritical during a war fought in defense of  the four freedoms.                       [Footnote 1-39: Herbert Garfinkle, _When Negroes                     March: The March on Washington Movement in the                     Organizational Politics of FEPC_ (Glencoe: The Free                     Press, 1959), provides a comprehensive account of                     the aims and achievements of the movement.]          CHAPTER 2                                                          (p. 017)    World War II: The Army      Civil rights leaders adopted the \"Double V\" slogan as their rallying  cry during World War II. Demanding victory against fascism abroad and  discrimination at home, they exhorted black citizens to support the  war effort and to fight for equal treatment and opportunity for  Negroes everywhere. Although segregation was their main target, their  campaign was directed against all forms of discrimination, especially  in the armed forces. They flooded the services with appeals for a  redress of black grievances and levied similar demands on the White  House, Congress, and the courts.    Black leaders concentrated on the services because they were public  institutions, their officials sworn to uphold the Constitution. The  leaders understood, too, that disciplinary powers peculiar to the  services enabled them to make changes that might not be possible for  other organizations; the armed forces could command where others could  only persuade. The Army bore the brunt of this attention, but not  because its policies were so benighted. In 1941 the Army was a fairly  progressive organization, and few institutions in America could match  its record. Rather, the civil rights leaders concentrated on the Army  because the draft law had made it the nation's largest employer of  minority groups.    For its part, the Army resisted the demands, its spokesmen contending  that the service's enormous size and power should not be used for  social experiment, especially during a war. Further justifying their  position, Army officials pointed out that their service had to avoid  conflict with prevailing social attitudes, particularly when such  attitudes were jealously guarded by Congress. In this period of  continuous demand and response, the Army developed a racial policy  that remained in effect throughout the war with only superficial  modifications sporadically adopted to meet changing conditions.      _A War Policy: Reaffirming Segregation_    The experience of World War I cast a shadow over the formation of the  Army's racial policy in World War II.[2-1] The chief architects of the  new policy, and many of its opponents, were veterans of the first war  and reflected in their judgments the passions and prejudices of that  era.[2-2] Civil rights activists were determined to eliminate the  (p. 018)  segregationist practices of the 1917 mobilization and to win a  fair representation for Negroes in the Army. The traditionalists of  the Army staff, on the other hand, were determined to resist any  radical change in policy. Basing their arguments on their evaluation  of the performance of the 92d Division and some other black units in  World War I, they had made, but not publicized, mobilization plans  that recognized the Army's obligation to employ black soldiers yet  rigidly maintained the segregationist policy of World War I.[2-3] These  plans increased the number of types of black units to be formed and  even provided for a wide distribution of the units among all the arms  and services except the Army Air Forces and Signal Corps, but they did  not explain how the skilled Negro, whose numbers had greatly increased  since World War I, could be efficiently used within the limitations of  black units. In the name of military efficiency the Army staff had, in  effect, devised a social rather than a military policy for the  employment of black troops.                       [Footnote 2-1: This survey of the Army and the Negro                     in World War II is based principally on Lee's                     _Employment of Negro Troops_.

Bababalouk did all in his power to console the ambassadors, but the two  most infirm expired on the spot; the rest were carried to their beds,  from whence, being heart-broken with sorrow and shame, they never arose.    The succeeding night Vathek, attended by his mother, ascended the tower  to see if everything were ready for his journey; for he had great faith  in the influence of the stars.  The planets appeared in their most  favourable aspects.  The Caliph, to enjoy so flattering a sight, supped  gaily on the roof, and fancied that he heard during his repast loud  shouts of laughter resound through the sky, in a manner that inspired the  fullest assurance.    All was in motion at the palace; lights were kept burning through the  whole of the night; the sound of implements and of artisans finishing  their work, the voices of women and their guardians who sung at their  embroidery, all conspired to interrupt the stillness of nature and  infinitely delight the heart of Vathek, who imagined himself going in  triumph to sit upon the throne of Soliman.    The people were not less satisfied than himself; all assisted to  accelerate the moment which should rescue them from the wayward caprices  of so extravagant a master.    The day preceding the departure of this infatuated prince was employed by  Carathis in repeating to him the decrees of the mysterious parchment,  which she had thoroughly gotten by heart, and in recommending him not to  enter the habitation of any one by the way; \"for well thou knowest,\"  added she, \"how liquorish thy taste is after good dishes and young  damsels; let me, therefore, enjoin thee to be content with thy old cooks,  who are the best in the world, and not to forget that in thy ambulatory  seraglio there are three dozen pretty faces, which Bababalouk hath not  yet unveiled.  I myself have a great desire to watch over thy conduct,  and visit the subterranean palace, which no doubt contains whatever can  interest persons like us; there is nothing so pleasing as retiring to  caverns; my taste for dead bodies and everything like mummy is decided;  and I am confident thou wilt see the most exquisite of their kind.  Forget me not, then, but the moment thou art in possession of the  talismans which are to open to thee the mineral kingdoms and the centre  of the earth itself, fail not to despatch some trusty genius to take me  and my cabinet, for the oil of the serpents I have pinched to death will  be a pretty present to the Giaour, who cannot but be charmed with such  dainties.\"    Scarcely had Carathis ended this edifying discourse when the sun, setting  behind the mountain of the Four Fountains, gave place to the rising moon;  this planet, being that evening at full, appeared of unusual beauty and  magnitude in the eyes of the women, the eunuchs, and the pages, who were  all impatient to set forward.  The city re-echoed with shouts of joy and  flourishing of trumpets; nothing was visible but plumes nodding on  pavilions, and aigrets shining in the mild lustre of the moon; the  spacious square resembled an immense parterre, variegated with the most  stately tulips of the East.    Arrayed in the robes which were only worn at the most distinguished  ceremonials, and supported by his Vizir and Bababalouk, the Caliph  descended the grand staircase of the tower in the sight of all his  people; he could not forbear pausing at intervals to admire the superb  appearance which everywhere courted his view, whilst the whole multitude,  even to the camels with their sumptuous burdens, knelt down before him.  For some time a general stillness prevailed, which nothing happened to  disturb but the shrill screams of some eunuchs in the rear; these  vigilant guards, having remarked certain cages of the ladies swagging  somewhat awry, and discovered that a few adventurous gallants had  contrived to get in, soon dislodged the enraptured culprits.  The majesty  of so magnificent a spectacle was not, however, violated by incidents  like these.  Vathek meanwhile saluted the moon with an idolatrous air,  that neither pleased Morakanabad nor the Doctors of the Law, any more  than the vizirs and the grandees of his court, who were all assembled to  enjoy the last view of their sovereign.    At length the clarions and trumpets from the top of the tower announced  the prelude of departure; though the instruments were in unison with each  other, yet a singular dissonance was blended with their sounds; this  proceeded from Carathis, who was singing her direful orisons to the  Giaour, whilst the negresses and mutes supplied thorough-base without  articulating a word.  The good Mussulmans fancied that they heard the  sullen hum of those nocturnal insects which presage evil, and importuned  Vathek to beware how he ventured his sacred person.    On a given signal the great standard of the Califat was displayed, twenty  thousand lances shone around it, and the Caliph, treading loyally on the  cloth of gold which had been spread for his feet, ascended his litter  amidst the general awe that possessed his subjects.    The expedition commenced with the utmost order and so entire a silence,  that even the locusts were heard from the thickets on the plain of  Catoul.  Gaiety and good-humour prevailing, six good leagues were past  before the dawn; and the morning star was still glittering in the  firmament when the whole of this numerous train had halted on the banks  of the Tigris, where they encamped to repose for the rest of the day.    The three days that followed were spent in the same manner; but on the  fourth the heavens looked angry, lightnings broke forth in frequent  flashes, re-echoing peals of thunder succeeded, and the trembling  Circassians clung with all their might to their ugly guardians.  The  Caliph himself was greatly inclined to take shelter in the large town of  Gulchissar, the governor of which came forth to meet him, and tendered  every kind of refreshment the place could supply; but, having examined  his tablets, he suffered the rain to soak him almost to the bone,  notwithstanding the importunity of his first favourites.  Though he began  to regret the palace of the senses, yet he lost not sight of his  enterprise, and his sanguine expectations confirmed his resolution; his  geographers were ordered to attend him, but the weather proved so  terrible that these poor people exhibited a lamentable appearance; and,  as no long journeys had been undertaken since the time of Haroun al  Raschid, their maps of the different countries were in a still worse  plight than themselves; every one was ignorant which way to turn; for  Vathek, though well versed in the course of the heavens, no longer knew  his situation on earth; he thundered even louder than the elements, and  muttered forth certain hints of the bow-string, which were not very  soothing to literary ears.  Disgusted at the toilsome weariness of the  way, he determined to cross over the craggy heights and follow the  guidance of a peasant, who undertook to bring him in four days to  Rocnabad.  Remonstrances were all to no purpose; his resolution was  fixed, and an invasion commenced on the province of the goats, who sped  away in large troops before them.  It was curious to view on these half  calcined rocks camels richly caparisoned, and pavilions of gold and silk  waving on their summits, which till then had never been covered but with  sapless thistles and fern.    The females and eunuchs uttered shrill wailings at the sight of the  precipices below them, and the dreary prospects that opened in the vast  gorges of the mountains.  Before they could reach the ascent of the  steepest rock, night overtook them, and a boisterous tempest arose,  which, having rent the awnings of the palanquins and cages, exposed to  the raw gusts the poor ladies within, who had never before felt so  piercing a cold.  The dark clouds that overcast the face of the sky  deepened the horrors of this disastrous night, insomuch that nothing  could be heard distinctly but the mewling of pages and lamentations of  sultanas.    To increase the general misfortune, the frightful uproar of wild beasts  resounded at a distance, and there were soon perceived, in the forest  they were skirting, the glaring of eyes which could belong only to devils  or tigers.  The pioneers, who, as well as they could, had marked out a  track, and a part of the advanced guard were devoured before they had  been in the least apprized of their danger.  The confusion that prevailed  was extreme; wolves, tigers, and other carnivorous animals, invited by  the howling of their companions, flocked together from every quarter; the  crashing of bones was heard on all sides, and a fearful rush of wings  overhead, for now vultures also began to be of the party.    The terror at length reached the main body of the troops which surrounded  the monarch and his harem, at the distance of two leagues from the scene.  Vathek (voluptuously reposed in his capacious litter upon cushions of  silk, with two little pages beside him of complexions more fair than the  enamel of Franguestan, who were occupied in keeping off flies) was  soundly asleep, and contemplating in his dreams the treasures of Soliman.  The shrieks, however, of his wives awoke him with a start, and, instead  of the Giaour with his key of gold, he beheld Bababalouk full of  consternation.    \"Sire,\" exclaimed this good servant of the most potent of monarchs,  \"misfortune is arrived at its height; wild beasts, who entertain no more  reverence for your sacred person than for that of a dead ass, have beset  your camels and their drivers; thirty of the richest laden are already  become their prey, as well as your confectioners, your cooks, and  purveyors; and, unless our holy Prophet should protect us, we shall have  all eaten our last meal.\"    At the mention of eating the Caliph lost "]]]
