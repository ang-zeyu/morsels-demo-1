Andrews_ Church, the Captaine of the Guard was _White_ the Barber.    \"Till noon, they were quiet, then came one _Joyce_, a Hackney man,  whom _White_ bid stand, the fellow asked what the matter was, and  withall called him _Roundhead_; whereat _White_ being moved, cocked  his Pistoll and would have shot him, but the Major wisht him to hold:  Neverthelesse he shot, and the fellow fell down, but was not dead.  Whence arose a sudden clamour that a man was murdered, whereupon the  people came forth with clubs, and the _Major_ and _Aldermen_ made  haste away; the Towne rose againe, and the Country came in, took  possession of the Gates, and made enquiry for _White_; they found him  in a hay loft, where they broke his head, and drag'd him in the  streets, setting open the Prison dores and releasing those that were  in hold.    \"Next, they vowed vengeance on the _Major_, pulling up his posts,  breaking his windowes; but, at last, being perswaded by Sir _William  Man_, Master _Lovelise_, Master _Harris_, and Master _Purser_, had  much adoe to persuade them from taking of his Person; so came  tumultuously into the high street, and their demands were so high,  that those Gentlemen could not perswade them. Afterward, meeting  Master _Burly_, the Town Clark, demanded the Keyes of the Prison from  him, which, being granted, they, with those Gentlemen formerly named,  went again to the Town Hall to Treat, and came to an agreement, which  was, that forty or fifty of their own men should keep the Town that  night, being compleatly armed, which being performed (the morning  issued) and they continued in arms till Tuesday morning: There are  none as yet dead, but diverse dangerously hurt.    \"Master _Sheriffe_ taking _White's_ part, and striving to keep the  Peace, was knockt down, and his head fearfully broke; it was God's  mercy his braines were not beat out, but it should seem he had a  clung[10] pate of his own.    [Footnote 10: Tough or strong.]    \"They went also without S. _George's_ gate, and did much injury to Mr.  _Lee_.    \"As I am credibly informed, the injuries done are these.    \"They have beat down all the windowes of Mr. _Major's_ House, burnt  the Stoups at the comming in of his dore, Master _Reeves'_ Windowes  were broke, Master _Page_, and Master _Pollen_, one _Buchurst_,  Captaine _Bridge_, _Thomas Harris_, a busie prating fellow, and others  were sorely wounded.    \"It is Ordered that _Richard White_ and _Robert Hues_, being in  fetters, be tryed according to the Law, and upon faire Composition,  the multitude have delivered their Armes into the Hands of the City,  upon engagements of the best of the City that no man shall further  question or trouble them.\"    On this Christmas day, Parliament,[11] \"on Saturday, December 25th,  commonly called Christmas day, received some complaints of the  countenancing of malignant ministers in some parts of London, where  they preach and use the Common Prayer Book, contrary to the order of  Parliament, and some delinquent Ministers have power given them to  examine and punish churchwardens, sequestrators, and others that do  countenance delinquent ministers to preach, and commit them, if they  see cause; upon which some were taken into Custody.\" One instance of  this is given in Whitelocke's _Memorials_ (p. 286). \"Mr. Harris, a  Churchwarden of St. Martius, ordered to be committed for bringing  delinquents to preach there, and to be displaced from his office of  Churchwarden.\"    [Footnote 11: Rushworth's _Historical Collections_, pt. iv. vol. ii.  p. 944.]    And so it went on, the Parliament and Nonconformists doing their best  to suppress Christ-tide, and the populace stubbornly refusing to  submit, as is shown in a letter from Sir Thomas Gower to Mr. John  Langley, on December 28, 1652.[12] \"There is little worth writing,  most of the time being spent in endeavouring to take away the esteem  held of Christmas Day, to which end, order was made that whoever would  open shops should be protected by the State; yet I heard of no more  than two who did so, and one of them had better have given L50, his  wares were so dirtyed; and secondly, that no sermons should be  preached, which was observed (for aught I hear) save at Lincoln's  Inn.\"    [Footnote 12: Hist. MSS. Commission Reports, v. p. 192.]    Evelyn, who was a staunch Episcopalian, writes in deep despondency as  to the keeping of Christ-tide. \"1652, Dec. 25, Christmas day, no  Sermon any where, no church being permitted to be open, so observed it  at home. The next day, we went to Lewisham, where an honest divine  preached.\" \"1653, Dec. 25, Christmas-day. No churches, or public  assembly. I was fain to pass the devotions of that Blessed day with my  family at home.\" \"1654, Dec. 25, Christmas-day. No public offices in  Churches, but penalties on observers, so as I was constrained to  celebrate it at home.\"    On November 27, 1655, Cromwell promulgated an edict, prohibiting all  ministers of the Church of England from preaching or teaching in any  schools, and Evelyn sadly notes the fact. \"Dec. 25. There was no more  notice taken of Christmas day in Churches. I went to London, where  Dr. Wild preached the funeral sermon of Preaching,[13] this being the  last day; after which, Cromwell's proclamation was to take place, that  none of the Church of England should dare either to preach, or  administer Sacraments, teach school, etc., on pain of imprisonment or  exile. So this was the mournfullest day that in my life I had seen, or  the Church of England herself, since the Reformation; to the great  rejoicing of both Papist and Presbyter. So pathetic was his discourse,  that it drew many tears from the auditory. Myself, wife, and some of  our family received the Communion: God make me thankful, who hath  hitherto provided for us the food of our souls as well as bodies! The  Lord Jesus pity our distressed Church, and bring back the captivity of  Zion!\"    [Footnote 13: His text was 2 Cor. xiii. 9.]    His next recorded Christ-tide was an eventful one for him, and he thus  describes it: \"1657, Dec. 25. I went to London with my wife to  celebrate Christmas day, Mr. Gunning preaching in Exeter Chapel, on  Michah vii. 2. Sermon ended, as he was giving us the Holy Sacrament,  the Chapel was surrounded with soldiers, and all the Communicants and  assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in the house,  others carried away. It fell to my share to be confined to a room in  the house, where yet I was permitted to dine with the master of it,  the Countess of Dorset, Lady Hatton, and some others of quality who  invited me. In the afternoon, came Colonel Whalley, Goffe, and others,  from Whitehall, to examine us one by one; some they committed to the  Marshal, some to prison. When I came before them, they took my name  and abode, examined me why, contrary to the ordinance made, that none  should any longer observe the superstitious time of the Nativity (so  esteemed by them), I durst offend, and particularly be at Common  Prayers, which they told me was but the Mass in English, and  particularly pray for Charles Stuart, for which we had no Scripture. I  told them we did not pray for Charles Stuart, but for all Christian  Kings, Princes, and Governors. They replied, in doing so we prayed for  the King of Spain, too, who was their enemy, and a Papist, with other  frivolous and ensnaring questions and much threatening; and, finding  no colour to detain me, they dismissed me with much pity of my  ignorance. These were men of high flight and above ordinances, and  spake spiteful things of our Lord's Nativity. As we went up to receive  the Sacrament, the miscreants held their muskets against us, as if  they would have shot us at the Altar, but yet suffering us to finish  the Office of the Communion, as, perhaps, not having instructions what  to do, in case they found us in that action. So I got home late the  next day: blessed be God!\"    Cromwell himself seems to have been somewhat ashamed of these  persecutions and severities, for[14] (25th December 1657) \"Some  Congregations being met to observe this day, according to former  solemnity, and the _Protector_ being moved that Souldiers might be  sent to repress them, he advised against it, as that which was  contrary to the _Liberty of Conscience_ so much owned and pleaded for  by the _Protector_ and his friends; but, it being contrary to  Ordinances of Parliament (which were also opposed in the passing of  them) that these days should be so solemnized, the _Protector_ gave  way to it, and those meetings were suppressed by the Souldiers.\"    [Footnote 14: Whitelock's _Memorials_, ed. 1682, p. 666.]    But his life was drawing to a close, and with the Restoration of the  king came also that of Christ-tide, and there was no longer any need  of concealment, as Pepys tells us how he spent his Christmas day in  1662. \"Had a pleasant walk to White Hall, where I intended to have  received the Communion with the family, but I came a little too late.  So I walked up into the house, and spent my time looking over  pictures, particularly the ships in King Henry the VIII.ths voyage to  Bullaen; marking the great difference between those built then and  now. By and by down to the Chapel again, where Bishop Morley[15]  preached upon the Song of the Angels, 'Glory to God on high, on earth  peace, and good will towards men.'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#9)"],[1,"not contrary to mere worldly wisdom: whether,  even supposing we knew that splendour of dress did not cost suffering or  hunger, we might not put the splendour better in other things than  dress. And, supposing our mode of dress were really graceful or  beautiful, this might be a very doubtful question; for I believe true  nobleness of dress to be an important means of education, as it  certainly is a necessity to any nation which wishes to possess living  art, concerned with portraiture of human nature. No good historical  painting ever yet existed, or ever can exist, where the dresses of the  people of the time are not beautiful: and had it not been for the lovely  and fantastic dressing of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries,  neither French, nor Florentine, nor Venetian art could have risen to  anything like the rank it reached. Still, even then, the best dressing  was never the costliest; and its effect depended much more on its  beautiful and, in early times, modest, arrangement, and on the simple  and lovely masses of its colour, than on gorgeousness of clasp or  embroidery.      55. Whether we can ever return to any of those more perfect types of  form, is questionable; but there can be no more question that all the  money we spend on the forms of dress at present worn, is, so far as any  good purpose is concerned, wholly lost. Mind, in saying this, I reckon  among good purposes the purpose which young ladies are said sometimes  to entertain--of being married; but they would be married quite as soon  (and probably to wiser and better husbands) by dressing quietly, as by  dressing brilliantly: and I believe it would only be needed to lay  fairly and largely before them the real good which might be effected by  the sums they spend in toilettes, to make them trust at once only to  their bright eyes and braided hair for all the mischief they have a  mind to. I wish we could, for once, get the statistics of a London  season. There was much complaining talk in Parliament, last week,  of the vast sum the nation has given for the best Paul Veronese in  Venice--14,000_l._: I wonder what the nation meanwhile has given for its  ball-dresses! Suppose we could see the London milliners' bills, simply  for unnecessary breadths of slip and flounce, from April to July; I  wonder whether 14,000_l._ would cover _them_. But the breadths of slip  and flounce are by this time as much lost and vanished as last year's  snow; only they have done less good: but the Paul Veronese will last for  centuries, if we take care of it; and yet, we grumble at the price given  for the painting, while no one grumbles at the price of pride.      56. Time does not permit me to go into any farther illustration of the  various modes in which we build our statue out of snow, and waste our  labour on things that vanish. I must leave you to follow out the subject  for yourselves, as I said I should, and proceed, in our next lecture, to  examine the two other branches of our subject--namely, how to accumulate  our art, and how to distribute it. But, in closing, as we have been much  on the topic of good government, both of ourselves and others, let me  just give you one more illustration of what it means, from that old art  of which, next evening, I shall try to convince you that the value, both  moral and mercantile, is greater than we usually suppose.      57. One of the frescoes by Ambrozio Lorenzetti, in the town-hall of  Siena, represents, by means of symbolical figures, the principles of  Good Civic Government and of Good Government in general. The figure  representing this noble Civic Government is enthroned, and surrounded by  figures representing the Virtues, variously supporting or administering  its authority. Now, observe what work is given to each of these  virtues. Three winged ones--Faith, Hope, and Charity--surround the head  of the figure; not in mere compliance with the common and heraldic laws  of precedence among Virtues, such as we moderns observe habitually, but  with peculiar purpose on the part of the painter. Faith, as thus  represented ruling the thoughts of the Good Governor, does not mean  merely religious faith, understood in those times to be necessary to all  persons--governed no less than governors--but it means the faith which  enables work to be carried out steadily, in spite of adverse appearances  and expediencies; the faith in great principles, by which a civic ruler  looks past all the immediate checks and shadows that would daunt a  common man, knowing that what is rightly done will have a right issue,  and holding his way in spite of pullings at his cloak and whisperings in  his ear, enduring, as having in him a faith which is evidence of things  unseen.      58. And Hope, in like manner, is here not the heavenward hope which  ought to animate the hearts of all men; but she attends upon Good  Government, to show that all such government is _expectant_ as well as  _conservative_; that if it ceases to be hopeful of better things, it  ceases to be a wise guardian of present things: that it ought never, as  long as the world lasts, to be wholly content with any existing state of  institution or possession, but to be hopeful still of more wisdom and  power; not clutching at it restlessly or hastily, but feeling that its  real life consists in steady ascent from high to higher: conservative,  indeed, and jealously conservative of old things, but conservative of  them as pillars, not as pinnacles--as aids, but not as idols; and  hopeful chiefly, and active, in times of national trial or distress,  according to those first and notable words describing the queenly  nation: \"She riseth, _while it is yet night_.\"      59. And again, the winged Charity which is attendant on Good Government  has, in this fresco, a peculiar office. Can you guess what? If you  consider the character of contest which so often takes place among kings  for their crowns, and the selfish and tyrannous means they commonly take  to aggrandize or secure their power, you will, perhaps, be surprised to  hear that the office of Charity is to crown the King. And yet, if you  think of it a little, you will see the beauty of the thought which sets  her in this function: since, in the first place, all the authority of a  good governor should be desired by him only for the good of his people,  so that it is only Love that makes him accept or guard his crown: in the  second place, his chief greatness consists in the exercise of this love,  and he is truly to be revered only so far as his acts and thoughts are  those of kindness; so that Love is the light of his crown, as well as  the giver of it: lastly, because his strength depends on the affections  of his people, and it is only their love which can securely crown him,  and for ever. So that Love is the strength of his crown as well as the  light of it.      60. Then, surrounding the King, or in various obedience to him, appear  the dependent virtues, as Fortitude, Temperance, Truth, and other  attendant spirits, of all which I cannot now give account, wishing you  only to notice the one to whom are entrusted the guidance and  administration of the public revenues. Can you guess which it is likely  to be? Charity, you would have thought, should have something to do with  the business; but not so, for she is too hot to attend carefully to it.  Prudence, perhaps, you think of in the next place. No, she is too timid,  and loses opportunities in making up her mind. Can it be Liberality  then? No: Liberality is entrusted with some small sums; but she is a bad  accountant, and is allowed no important place in the exchequer. But the  treasures are given in charge to a virtue of which we hear too little in  modern times, as distinct from others; Magnanimity: largeness of heart:  not softness or weakness of heart, mind you--but capacity of heart--the  great _measuring_ virtue, which weighs in heavenly balances all that may  be given, and all that may be gained; and sees how to do noblest things  in noblest ways: which of two goods comprehends and therefore chooses  the greater: which of two personal sacrifices dares and accepts the  larger: which, out of the avenues of beneficence, treads always that  which opens farthest into the blue fields of futurity: that character,  in fine, which, in those words taken by us at first for the description  of a Queen among the nations, looks less to the present power than to  the distant promise; \"Strength and honour are in her clothing,--and she  shall rejoice IN TIME TO COME.\"          LECTURE II.    THE ACCUMULATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ART.    _Continuation of the previous Lecture; delivered July 13, 1857._      61. The heads of our subject which remain for our consideration this  evening are, you will remember, the accumulation and the distribution of  works of art. Our complete inquiry fell into four divisions--first, how  to get our genius; then, how to apply our genius; then, how to  accumulate its results; and lastly, how to distribute them. We  considered, last evening, how to discover and apply it;--we have  to-night to examine the modes of its preservation and distribution.      62. III. ACCUMULATION.--And now, in the outset, it will be well to face  that objection which we put aside a little while ago; namely, that  perhaps it is not well to have a great deal of good art; and that it  should not be made too cheap.    \"Nay,\" I can imagine some of the more generous among you exclaiming, \"we  will not trouble you to disprove that objection; of course it is a  selfish and base one: good art, as well as other good things, ought to  be made as cheap as possible, and put as far as we can within the reach  of everybody.\"      63. Pardon me, I am not prepared to admit that. I rather side with the  selfish objectors, and believe that art ought not to be made cheap,  beyond a certain point; for the amount of pleasure that you can receive  from any great work,"]]]
