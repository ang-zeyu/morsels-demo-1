Cast me not out, I implore Thee, of the presence of Thy grace,  neither do Thou withhold from me the outpourings of Thy generosity and  bounty. Ordain for me, O my Lord, what Thou hast ordained for them that  love Thee, and write down for me what Thou hast written down for Thy  chosen ones. My gaze hath, at all times, been fixed on the horizon of Thy  gracious providence, and mine eyes bent upon the court of Thy tender  mercies. Do with me as beseemeth Thee. No God is there but Thee, the God  of power, the God of glory, Whose help is implored by all men.    --Baha'u'llah        \"I am he, O my Lord, that hath set his face towards...\"      I am he, O my Lord, that hath set his face towards Thee, and fixed his  hope on the wonders of Thy grace and the revelations of Thy bounty. I pray  Thee that Thou wilt not suffer me to turn away disappointed from the door  of Thy mercy, nor abandon me to such of Thy creatures as have repudiated  Thy Cause.    I am, O my God, Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have recognized  Thy truth in Thy days, and have directed my steps towards the shores of  Thy oneness, confessing Thy singleness, acknowledging Thy unity, and  hoping for Thy forgiveness and pardon. Powerful art Thou to do what Thou  willest; no God is there beside Thee, the All-Glorious, the  Ever-Forgiving.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Thou seest me, O my Lord, with my face...\"      Thou seest me, O my Lord, with my face turned towards the heaven of Thy  bounty and the ocean of Thy favor, withdrawn from all else beside Thee. I  ask of Thee, by the splendors of the Sun of Thy revelation on Sinai, and  the effulgences of the Orb of Thy grace which shineth from the horizon of  Thy Name, the Ever-Forgiving, to grant me Thy pardon and to have mercy  upon me. Write down, then, for me with Thy pen of glory that which will  exalt me through Thy Name in the world of creation. Aid me, O my Lord, to  set myself towards Thee, and to hearken unto the voice of Thy loved ones,  whom the powers of the earth have failed to weaken, and the dominion of  the nations has been powerless to withhold from Thee, and who, advancing  towards Thee, have said: \"God is our Lord, the Lord of all who are in  heaven and all who are on earth!\"    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I venture to make mention of  Thee, I am held back by my mighty sins and grievous trespasses against  Thee, and find myself wholly deprived of Thy grace, and utterly powerless  to celebrate Thy praise. My great confidence in Thy bounty, however,  reviveth my hope in Thee, and my certitude that Thou wilt bountifully deal  with me emboldeneth me to extol Thee, and to ask of Thee the things Thou  dost possess.    I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy mercy that hath surpassed all created  things, and to which all that are immersed beneath the oceans of Thy names  bear witness, not to abandon me unto my self, for my heart is prone to  evil. Guard me, then, within the stronghold of Thy protection and the  shelter of Thy care. I am he, O my God, whose only wish is what Thou hast  determined by the power of Thy might. All I have chosen for myself is to  be assisted by Thy gracious appointments and the ruling of Thy will, and  to be aided with the tokens of Thy decree and judgment.    I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of the hearts which long for  Thee, by the Manifestations of Thy Cause and the Daysprings of Thine  inspiration, and the Exponents of Thy majesty, and the Treasuries of Thy  knowledge, not to suffer me to be deprived of Thy holy Habitation, Thy  Fane and Thy Tabernacle. Aid me, O my Lord, to attain His hallowed court,  and to circle round His person, and to stand humbly at His door.    Thou art He Whose power is from everlasting to everlasting. Nothing  escapeth Thy knowledge. Thou art, verily, the God of power, the God of  glory and wisdom.    Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds!    --Baha'u'llah        \"Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of all things, my Glory and the  Glory of all things, my Desire and the Desire of all things, my Strength  and the Strength of all things, my King and the King of all things, my  Possessor and the Possessor of all things, my Aim and the Aim of all  things, my Mover and the Mover of all things! Suffer me not, I implore  Thee, to be kept back from the ocean of Thy tender mercies, nor to be far  removed from the shores of nearness to Thee.    Aught else except Thee, O my Lord, profiteth me not, and near access to  anyone save Thyself availeth me nothing. I entreat Thee by the  plenteousness of Thy riches, whereby Thou didst dispense with all else  except Thyself, to number me with such as have set their faces towards  Thee, and arisen to serve Thee.    Forgive, then, O my Lord, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens. Thou, truly,  art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O God our Lord! Protect us through Thy...\"      O God our Lord! Protect us through Thy grace from whatsoever may be  repugnant unto Thee, and vouchsafe unto us that which well beseemeth Thee.  Give us more out of Thy bounty, and bless us. Pardon us for the things we  have done, and wash away our sins, and forgive us with Thy gracious  forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting.    Thy loving providence hath encompassed all created things in the heavens  and on the earth, and Thy forgiveness hath surpassed the whole creation.  Thine is sovereignty; in Thy hand are the Kingdoms of Creation and  Revelation; in Thy right hand Thou holdest all created things, and within  Thy grasp are the assigned measures of forgiveness. Thou forgivest  whomsoever among Thy servants Thou pleasest. Verily, Thou art the  Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge,  and naught is there which is hidden from Thee.    O God our Lord! Protect us through the potency of Thy might, enable us to  enter Thy wondrous surging ocean, and grant us that which well befitteth  Thee.    Thou art the Sovereign Ruler, the Mighty Doer, the Exalted, the  All-Loving.    --The Bab        \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord. Forgive us our...\"      Praise be unto Thee, O Lord. Forgive us our sins, have mercy upon us and  enable us to return unto Thee. Suffer us not to rely on aught else besides  Thee, and vouchsafe unto us, through Thy bounty, that which Thou lovest  and desirest and well beseemeth Thee. Exalt the station of them that have  truly believed, and forgive them with Thy gracious forgiveness. Verily,  Thou art the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    --The Bab        \"I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every...\"      I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every mention but the mention of  Thee, and for every praise but the praise of Thee, and for every delight  but delight in Thy nearness, and for every pleasure but the pleasure of  communion with Thee, and for every joy but the joy of Thy love and of Thy  good-pleasure, and for all things pertaining unto me which bear no  relationship unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of lords, He Who provideth  the means and unlocketh the doors.    --The Bab        \"Glory be unto Thee, O God. How can I make...\"      Glory be unto Thee, O God. How can I make mention of Thee while Thou art  sanctified from the praise of all mankind. Magnified be Thy Name, O God,  Thou art the King, the Eternal Truth; Thou knowest what is in the heavens  and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return. Thou hast sent down Thy  divinely ordained Revelation according to a clear measure. Praised art  Thou, O Lord! At Thy behest Thou dost render victorious whomsoever Thou  willest, through the hosts of heaven and earth and whatsoever existeth  between them. Thou art the Sovereign, the Eternal Truth, the Lord of  invincible might.    Glorified art Thou, O Lord, Thou forgivest at all times the sins of such  among Thy servants as implore Thy pardon. Wash away my sins and the sins  of those who seek Thy forgiveness at dawn, who pray to Thee in the daytime  and in the night season, who yearn after naught save God, who offer up  whatsoever God hath graciously bestowed upon them, who celebrate Thy  praise at morn and eventide, and who are not remiss in their duties.    --The Bab        \"O Thou forgiving Lord! Thou art the shelter...\"      O Thou forgiving Lord! Thou art the shelter of all these Thy servants.  Thou knowest the secrets and art aware of all things. We are all helpless,  and Thou art the Mighty, the Omnipotent. We are all sinners, and Thou art  the Forgiver of sins, the Merciful, the Compassionate. O Lord! Look not at  our shortcomings. Deal with us according to Thy grace and bounty. Our  shortcomings are many, but the ocean of Thy forgiveness is boundless. Our  weakness is grievous, but the evidences of Thine aid and assistance are  clear. Therefore, confirm and strengthen us. Enable us to do that which is  worthy of Thy holy Threshold. Illumine our hearts, grant us discerning  eyes and attentive ears. Resuscitate the dead and heal the sick. Bestow  wealth upon the poor and give peace and security to the fearful. Accept us  in Thy kingdom and illumine us with the light of guidance. Thou are the  Powerful and the Omnipotent. Thou art the Generous. Thou art the Clement.  Thou art the Kind.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          THE FUND        \"O God, my God! Illumine the brows of Thy...\"      All the friends of God ... should contribute to the extent possible,  however modest their offering may be. God doth not burden a soul beyond  its capacity. Such contributions must come from all centers and all  believers. ... O Friends of God!

It should be consistently demonstrated in every phase of their  activity and life, whether in the Baha'i community or outside it, in  public or in private, formally as well as informally, individually as well  as in their official capacity as organized groups, committees and  Assemblies. It should be deliberately cultivated through the various and  everyday opportunities, no matter how insignificant, that present  themselves, whether in their homes, their business offices, their schools  and colleges, their social parties and recreation grounds, their Baha'i  meetings, conferences, conventions, summer schools and Assemblies. It  should, above all else, become the keynote of the policy of that august  body which, in its capacity as the national representative, and the  director and coordinator of the affairs of the community, must set the  example, and facilitate the application of such a vital principle to the  lives and activities of those whose interests it safeguards and  represents.    \"O ye discerning ones!\" Baha'u'llah has written, \"Verily, the words which  have descended from the heaven of the Will of God are the source of unity  and harmony for the world. Close your eyes to racial differences, and  welcome all with the light of oneness.\" \"We desire but the good of the  world and the happiness of the nations,\" He proclaims, \"...that all  nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds  of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened;  that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be  annulled.\" \"Baha'u'llah hath said,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"that the various  races of humankind lend a composite harmony and beauty of color to the  whole. Let all associate, therefore, in this great human garden even as  flowers grow and blend together side by side without discord or  disagreement between them.\" \"Baha'u'llah,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha moreover has said,  \"once compared the colored people to the black pupil of the eye surrounded  by the white. In this black pupil is seen the reflection of that which is  before it, and through it the light of the spirit shineth forth.\"    \"God,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself declares, \"maketh no distinction between the  white and the black. If the hearts are pure both are acceptable unto Him.  God is no respecter of persons on account of either color or race. All  colors are acceptable unto Him, be they white, black, or yellow. Inasmuch  as all were created in the image of God, we must bring ourselves to  realize that all embody divine possibilities.\" \"In the estimation of God,\"  He states, \"all men are equal. There is no distinction or preference for  any soul, in the realm of His justice and equity.\" \"God did not make these  divisions,\" He affirms; \"these divisions have had their origin in man  himself. Therefore, as they are against the plan and purpose of God they  are false and imaginary.\" \"In the estimation of God,\" He again affirms,  \"there is no distinction of color; all are one in the color and beauty of  servitude to Him. Color is not important; the heart is all-important. It  mattereth not what the exterior may be if the heart is pure and white  within. God doth not behold differences of hue and complexion. He looketh  at the hearts. He whose morals and virtues are praiseworthy is preferred  in the presence of God; he who is devoted to the Kingdom is most beloved.  In the realm of genesis and creation the question of color is of least  importance.\" \"Throughout the animal kingdom,\" He explains, \"we do not find  the creatures separated because of color. They recognize unity of species  and oneness of kind. If we do not find color distinction drawn in a  kingdom of lower intelligence and reason, how can it be justified among  human beings, especially when we know that all have come from the same  source and belong to the same household? In origin and intention of  creation mankind is one. Distinctions of race and color have arisen  afterward.\" \"Man is endowed with superior reasoning power and the faculty  of perception\"; He further explains, \"he is the manifestation of divine  bestowals. Shall racial ideas prevail and obscure the creative purpose of  unity in his kingdom?\" \"One of the important questions,\" He significantly  remarks, \"which affect the unity and the solidarity of mankind is the  fellowship and equality of the white and colored races. Between these two  races certain points of agreement and points of distinction exist which  warrant just and mutual consideration. The points of contact are many....  In this country, the United States of America, patriotism is common to  both races; all have equal rights to citizenship, speak one language,  receive the blessings of the same civilization, and follow the precepts of  the same religion. In fact numerous points of partnership and agreement  exist between the two races, whereas the one point of distinction is that  of color. Shall this, the least of all distinctions, be allowed to  separate you as races and individuals?\" \"This variety in forms and  coloring,\" He stresses, \"which is manifest in all the kingdoms is  according to creative Wisdom and hath a divine purpose.\" \"The diversity in  the human family,\" He claims, \"should be the cause of love and harmony, as  it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of  a perfect chord.\" \"If you meet,\" is His admonition, \"those of a different  race and color from yourself, do not mistrust them, and withdraw yourself  into your shell of conventionality, but rather be glad and show them  kindness.\" \"In the world of being,\" He testifies, \"the meeting is blessed  when the white and colored races meet together with infinite spiritual  love and heavenly harmony. When such meetings are established, and the  participants associate with each other with perfect love, unity and  kindness, the angels of the Kingdom praise them, and the Beauty of  Baha'u'llah addresseth them, 'Blessed are ye! Blessed are ye!'\" \"When a  gathering of these two races is brought about,\" He likewise asserts, \"that  assemblage will become the magnet of the Concourse on high, and the  confirmation of the Blessed Beauty will surround it.\" \"Strive earnestly,\"  He again exhorts both races, \"and put forth your greatest endeavor toward  the accomplishment of this fellowship and the cementing of this bond of  brotherhood between you. Such an attainment is not possible without will  and effort on the part of each; from one, expressions of gratitude and  appreciation; from the other, kindliness and recognition of equality. Each  one should endeavor to develop and assist the other toward mutual  advancement.... Love and unity will be fostered between you, thereby  bringing about the oneness of mankind. For the accomplishment of unity  between the colored and white will be an assurance of the world's peace.\"  \"I hope,\" He thus addresses members of the white race, \"that ye may cause  that downtrodden race to become glorious, and to be joined with the white  race, to serve the world of man with the utmost sincerity, faithfulness,  love, and purity. This opposition, enmity, and prejudice among the white  race and the colored cannot be effaced except through faith, assurance,  and the teachings of the Blessed Beauty.\" \"This question of the union of  the white and the black is very important,\" He warns, \"for if it is not  realized, erelong great difficulties will arise, and harmful results will  follow.\" \"If this matter remaineth without change,\" is yet another  warning, \"enmity will be increased day by day, and the final result will  be hardship and may end in bloodshed.\"    A tremendous effort is required by both races if their outlook, their  manners, and conduct are to reflect, in this darkened age, the spirit and  teachings of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Casting away once and for all the  fallacious doctrine of racial superiority, with all its attendant evils,  confusion, and miseries, and welcoming and encouraging the intermixture of  races, and tearing down the barriers that now divide them, they should  each endeavor, day and night, to fulfill their particular responsibilities  in the common task which so urgently faces them. Let them, while each is  attempting to contribute its share to the solution of this perplexing  problem, call to mind the warnings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and visualize, while  there is yet time, the dire consequences that must follow if this  challenging and unhappy situation that faces the entire American nation is  not definitely remedied.    Let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to contribute their  share to the solution of this problem, to abandon once for all their  usually inherent and at times subconscious sense of superiority, to  correct their tendency towards revealing a patronizing attitude towards  the members of the other race, to persuade them through their intimate,  spontaneous and informal association with them of the genuineness of their  friendship and the sincerity of their intentions, and to master their  impatience of any lack of responsiveness on the part of a people who have  received, for so long a period, such grievous and slow-healing wounds. Let  the Negroes, through a corresponding effort on their part, show by every  means in their power the warmth of their response, their readiness to  forget the past, and their ability to wipe out every trace of suspicion  that may still linger in their hearts and minds. Let neither think that  the solution of so vast a problem is a matter that exclusively concerns  the other. Let neither think that such a problem can either easily or  immediately be resolved. Let neither think that they can wait confidently  for the solution of this problem until the initiative has been taken, and  the"]]]
