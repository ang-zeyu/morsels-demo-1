Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases.      I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,      But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not.      I'm not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,      But of a thundering No! point-blank from the mouth of a woman,      That I confess I am afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!      Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!\"        Then made answer John Alden: \"The name of friendship is sacred;      What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!\"      So the strong will prevailed, subduing and molding the gentler,      Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand.          II        So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,      Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,      Into the tranquil woods, where bluebirds and robins were building      Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of [v]verdure,      Peaceful, [v]aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom.      All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,      Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse.        So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;      Saw the new-built house, and people at work in a meadow;      Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla      Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,      Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many.      Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden      Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift      Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,      While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.        So he entered the house; and the hum of the wheel and the singing      Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,      Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,      Saying, \"I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;      For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.\"      Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled      Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,      Silent before her he stood.      \"I have been thinking all day,\" said gently the Puritan maiden,      \"Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedgerows of          England,--      They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;      Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,      Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors      Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together.      Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;      Still my heart is so sad that I wish myself back in Old England.      You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it; I almost      Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.\"        Thereupon answered the youth: \"Indeed I do not condemn you;      Stouter hearts than a woman's have quailed in this terrible winter.      Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;      So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage      Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!\"      Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters,--      Did not [v]embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,      But came straight to the point and blurted it out like a schoolboy;      Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.      Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden      Looked into Alden's face, her eyes dilated with wonder,      Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned and rendered her          speechless;      Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:      \"If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,      Why does he not come himself and take trouble to woo me?      If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!\"      Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,      Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,--      Had no time for such things;--such things! the words grating harshly,      Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:      \"Has he not time for such things, as you call it, before he is married,      Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?\"      Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,      Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding.      But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,      Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,      Archly the maiden smiled, and with eyes overrunning with laughter,      Said, in a tremulous voice, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\"    With conflicting feelings of love for Priscilla and duty to his friend,  Miles Standish, John Alden does not \"speak for himself,\" but returns to  Plymouth to tell Standish the result of the interview.        Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure,      From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;      How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,      Only smoothing a little and softening down her refusal.      But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,      Words so tender and cruel: \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\"      Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, till his          armor      Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen.      All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,      E'en as a hand grenade, that scatters destruction around it.      Wildly he shouted and loud: \"John Alden! you have betrayed me!      Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded, betrayed          me!      You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;      Henceforth let there be nothing between us save war, and implacable          hatred!\"        So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,      Chafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins on his          temples.      But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,      Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,      Rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians!      Straightway the Captain paused, and, without further question or          parley,      Took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,      Buckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed.      Alden was left alone. He heard the clank of the scabbard      Growing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance.      Then he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,      Felt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,      Lifted his eyes to the heavens and, folding his hands as in childhood,      Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.          III.    A report comes to the settlement that Miles Standish has been killed in  a fight with the Indians. John Alden, feeling that Standish's death has  freed him from the need of keeping his own love for Priscilla silent,  woos and wins her. At last the wedding-day arrives.        This was the wedding-morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.      Friends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also      Graced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the          Gospel,      One with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven.      Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz.      Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,      Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate's presence,      After the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of Holland.      Fervently then, and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth      Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in          affection,      Speaking of life and death, and imploring Divine benedictions.      Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,      Clad in armor of steel, a somber and sorrowful figure!      Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?      Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?      Is it a phantom of air,--a bodiless, spectral illusion?      Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?      Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;      Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression      Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them.      Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,      As if an iron will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19723"],[0,"The Cliff Ruins of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona (#9)"],[1,"of cultivable land on both  sides of the canyon. There is a large isolated mass of rock here, nearly  as high as the cliffs on either side, and connected with those back of  it by a slope of talus and debris, partly bare rock, partly covered with  sand dunes. At the point where the ruin occurs the rock is bare and  about 40 feet high, partly overhanging the site. The remains, shown in  plan in figure 12, occupy the summit of a hill about 10 feet high,  composed principally of debris of walls. Only a few faint traces now  remain, but two kivas are still clearly distinguishable. The one on the  south had an interior bench, which apparently extended around it. The  other shows walls 2 feet high, and has been plastered with a number of  successive coats. The small wall on the extreme right of the plan is  composed of almost pure mud.    There are a number of ruins in the canyons of the type shown in figure  13. They are generally located directly on the bottom, and seldom as  much as 5 feet above it, within coves or under overhanging cliffs; they  are always of small area, and generally so far obliterated that no walls  or wall remains are now visible. The obliteration is due not so much to  antiquity, which may or may not have been a cause, but to the character  of the site they occupied. They are always in sheltered situations, and  being on the canyon bottom are much used by the Navaho as sheepfolds and  have been so used for years. Sometimes, although rarely, faint traces of  kivas can be made out.      [Illustration: Fig. 13--Ground plan of a small ruin on bottom land.]    The example illustrated occurs at the point marked 43 on the map. It is  situated in a cove in a point of rock jutting out from the main cliff.  The rock is about 60 feet high and the cove about 30 feet deep, and the  remains are but a few feet above the level of the bottom land outside.  The walls are composed of rather small stones; the interstices were  chinked with spawls, and the masonry was laid up with an abundance of  mud mortar. The back wall of the cove is considerably blackened by  smoke.    One of the most striking and most important ruins in the canyon is shown  in plan in figures 14 and 15. This is the ruin seen by Lieutenant  Simpson in 1849 and subsequently called Casa Blanca. It is also known  under the equivalent Navaho term, Kini-na e-kai or White House. The  general character of the ruin is shown in plate XLVII, which is from a  photograph. At first sight this ruin appears not to belong to this  class, or rather to belong both to this class and the succeeding one  composed of villages located with reference to defense; but, as will  appear later, it has nothing in common with the latter.      [Illustration: Plate XLVII    Casa Blanca Ruin, Canyon De Chelly]    In its present condition the ruin consists of two distinct parts--a  lower part, comprising a large cluster of rooms on the bottom land  against the vertical cliff, and an upper part which was much smaller and  occupied a cave directly over the lower portion and was separated from  it only by some 35 feet of vertical cliff. There is evidence, however,  that some of the houses in the lower settlement were four stories high  against the cliff, and in fact that the structures were practically  continuous; but for convenience of description we may regard the ruin as  composed of two.    The lower ruin covers an area of about 150 by 50 feet, raised but a few  feet above the bottom land, probably by its own debris. Within this area  there are remains of 45 rooms on the ground, in addition to a circular  kiva. On the east side there are walls still standing to a height of 12  and 14 feet. It is probable that the lower ruin comprised about 60  rooms, which, with a liberal allowance for the rooms in the cave, would  make a total of 80. This would furnish accommodations for a maximum of  10 or 12 families or a total population of 50 or 60 persons. It is  probable, however, that this estimate is excessive and that the total  population at any one time did not exceed 30 or 40 persons.      [Illustration: Fig. 14--Ground plan of the lower part of Casa Blanca    ruin.]    The ground plans shown are the result of a very careful survey, plotted  on the ground on a large scale (10 feet to 1 inch--1:120), and the  irregularities shown were carefully noted and put down at the time.  These irregularities, which are commonly ignored in the preparation of  plans of ruins, are of the highest importance. From them the sequence of  construction can often be determined.      [Illustration: Fig. 15--Ground plan of the upper part of Casa Blanca    ruin.]    The walls of the lower ruin are somewhat obscured by loose debris, of  which a large amount is lying about. Roof debris is especially abundant;  it consists of small twigs and lumps of clay, with ends of beams  projecting here and there. The principal walls occur in the eastern  part, where some of them are 2 feet thick and still standing to a height  of 10 and 12 and in one place of 14 feet. An inspection of the plan will  show that, as is invariably the case where a wall rises to a height of  more than one story, the lower part is massive and the upper wall sets  back 5 or 6 inches, reducing its thickness by that amount. All the heavy  walls occur either about the kiva or east of it. Apparently these walls  were built first especially heavy and massive, and afterward, when upper  stories were added, it was not found necessary to carry them up the full  thickness. It will be noticed that the wall extending eastward from the  corner of the kiva, and which is from a foot to 6 feet high at the  present time, extends through the heavy wall which crosses it 33 feet to  the east, and is continuous to its termination about 50 feet east,  against another heavy wall. The last-mentioned wall is also continuous  from the cliff out to the front of the ruin, a distance of about 46  feet.    The heavy walls of the lower ruin are immediately under the upper cave.  Back of them the cliff presents an almost smooth face of rock, 35 feet  high and slightly overhanging. On this rock face there are marks which  show that formerly there were upper stories, the rooms of which are  outlined upon it. The rock surface was coated in places with a thin wash  of clay, doubtless to correspond with the other walls of the rooms, but  this coating was necessarily omitted where the partition walls and roofs  and floors abutted on the rock. This is shown in plate XLVII. Although  the marks are now so faint as to be easily overlooked, at a certain hour  in the day, when the light falls obliquely on the rock, they can be  clearly made out. At a point about 50 feet east of the kiva the  structure was three stories higher than it is now. The roof of the upper  story was within 4 feet of the floor of the cave, and under the gap or  gateway in front of the main room above. West of this point there are  the marks of but two stories additional. Farther west the structure rose  again, but not to the height attained on the east.    The kiva was placed directly against the cliff. This is an unusual  arrangement; but it will be noticed that the walls in front of it are of  a different character from those on the east, and it is probable that  when the kiva was built it opened to the air. The kiva is also anomalous  in its construction. It presents the usual features of the inner  circular chamber and an inclosing rectangular wall, but in this case the  intermediate space was filled in solidly, and perhaps was so  constructed. The kiva is still 6 feet deep inside, which must be nearly  its maximum depth, and the roof was probably placed at a level not more  than a foot or two above the present top. Whether the village was placed  on a slight raise, or on the flat, level with the bottom land about it,  and subsequently filled up with the debris of masonry, etc, can not be  determined without excavation; but the top of the kiva is now 16 feet  above the general level of the bottom land, and its bottom 10 feet above  that level. It is possible that the kiva was much deeper than now  appears, as no sign of the usual interior bench can be seen above the  present ground surface, nor can any connection with the chimney-like  structure to the south of it be determined, yet such connection must  have existed. Probably not only this kiva but the whole ruin would well  repay excavation.    The interior of the kiva was not exactly circular, being a little  elongated northeast and southwest. The inclosing wall on the east is  still standing in one place to a height of 5 feet above the top of the  kiva structure, and about a foot above that level is marked by a  setback, which reduces its thickness. Apparently the upper part was  added at a date some time subsequent to the completion of the kiva  structure, as the wall on the south, now some 3 feet above the level  mentioned, does not conform to the lower exterior wall on which it was  placed. On the western side there is another fragment of the upper  inclosing wall. Both this wall and the one on the south are less than 15  inches in thickness.    West of the kiva there are remains of other stone walls which differ in  character from those on the east. They are now usually less than 3 feet  high; they were 12 to 15 inches thick, and the lines are very irregular.  South of the kiva, in the center of the ruin, there are other stone  walls even thinner and more irregularly placed than those on the west,  but most of the walls here are of adobe. As the use of adobe blocks is  not an aboriginal feature, the occurrence of these walls is a matter of  much interest, especially as they are so intimately associated with the  stonework that it is not always an easy matter to separate them.    The occurrence and distribution of adobe walls is shown on the ground  plan. They are not found as subordinate walls, dividing larger rooms,  except perhaps in"]]]
