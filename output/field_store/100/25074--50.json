I strongly  incline to the opinion that there was an objective cause for the vision,  and that it was genuinely apparitional.\"    So interested was Mr. Kendall in the case that he visited the spot some  short time later. He was taken into the cellar where the manifestations  took place, and his guide, an old official of the North Road Station,  informed him he well remembered the clerk--a man of the name of  Winter--who committed suicide there, and showed him the exact spot where  he had shot himself with a pistol. In dress and appearance Mr. Winter  corresponded minutely with the phenomenon described by James Durham, and  he had had a black retriever.    Mr. Kendal came away more convinced than ever of the veracity of James  Durham's story, though he admits it was not evidential after the high  standard of the S.P.R. I do not know whether the S.P.R. published the  case, and I certainly do not think Mr. Kendall need have minded if they  did not--for after all there is no reason to suppose the judgment of the  S.P.R. is always infallible.    Mr. Stead does not comment on the apparition of the dog, which leads one  to suppose cases of animal phantasms were by no means uncommon to him.      _The Grey Dog of ---- House, Birmingham_    According to a story current in the Midlands, a house in Birmingham,  near the Roman Catholic Cathedral, was once very badly haunted. A family  who took up their abode in it in the 'eighties complained of hearing all  sorts of uncanny sounds--such as screams and sighs--coming from a room  behind the kitchen. On one occasion the tenant's wife, on entering the  sitting-room, was almost startled out of her senses at seeing, standing  before the fireplace, the figure of a tall, stout man with a large, grey  dog by his side. What was so alarming about the man was his face--it was  apparently a mere blob of flesh without any features in it. The lady  screamed out, whereupon there was a terrific crash, as if all the  crockery in the house had been suddenly clashed on the stone floor; and  a friend of the lady's, attracted to the spot by the noise, saw two  clouds of vapour, one resembling a man and the other a dog, which, after  hovering over the hearth for several seconds, finally dispersed  altogether.    A gasfitter, when working in the house, saw the same figures no less  than nine times, and so distinctly that he was able to give a detailed  description of both the man and dog.    The house seems to have been well known in Birmingham, and was certainly  standing as recently as 1885. Many theories were advanced as to its  history, the one gaining most credence being that it was occupied, in  1829, by a man who supplied the medical students with human bodies.    It was noticed at the time that many people who were seen to enter the  house in the company of the owner were never seen to leave it, which  accords well with the theory of resurrection men.    No suggestion has been offered to account for the animal, which may very  easily have been the phantom of the murderer's dog, or, what is rather  less likely, the dog of one of his numerous victims.    Anyhow, explanation or no explanation, the fact remains the house was  haunted in the manner described, and F. Grey, a Warwickshire Chief  Constable, in his _Recollections_, published 1821, alludes to it.      _The Dog in the Cupboard_    Miss Prettyman, whom I met some years ago in Cornwall, told me she once  lived in a house in Westmorland that was haunted by the apparition of a  large dog, enveloped in a blueish glow, which apparently emanated from  within it. The dog, whilst appearing in all parts of the house,  invariably vanished in a big cupboard at the back of the hall staircase.  Miss Prettyman, her family, several of their visitors, and the servants  all saw the same phantasm, and were, perhaps, more frightened by the  suddenness of its advent than by its actual appearance.    The theory was that it was the ghost of some dog that had been cruelly  done to death--possibly by starvation--in the cupboard.      _How the Ghost of a Dog saved Life_    When I was a boy, an elderly friend of mine, Miss Lefanu, narrated to me  an anecdote which impressed me much. It was to this effect.    Miss Lefanu was walking one day along a very lonely country lane, when  she suddenly observed an enormous Newfoundland dog following in her wake  a few yards behind. Being very fond of dogs, she called out to it in a  caressing voice and endeavoured to stroke it. To her disappointment,  however, it dodged aside, and repeated the manoeuvre every time she  tried to touch it. At length, losing patience, she desisted, and resumed  her walk, the dog still following her. In this fashion they went on,  until they came to a particularly dark part of the road, where the  branches of the trees almost met overhead, and there was a pool of  stagnant, slimy water, suggestive of great depth. On the one side the  hedge was high, but on the other there was a slight gap leading into a  thick spinney. Miss Lefanu never visited the spot alone after dusk, and  had been warned against it even in the daytime. As she drew near to it,  everything that she had ever heard about it flashed across her mind, and  she was more than once on the verge of turning back, when the sight of  the big, friendly-looking dog plodding behind, reassuring her, she  pressed on. Just as she came to the gap, there was a loud snapping of  twigs, and, to her horror, two tramps, with singularly sinister faces,  sprang out, and were about to strike her with their bludgeons, when the  dog, uttering a low, ominous growl, dashed at them. In an instant the  expression of murderous joy in their eyes died out, one of abject terror  took its place, and, dropping their weapons, they fled, as if the very  salvation of their souls depended on it. As may be imagined, Miss Lefanu  lost no time in getting home, and the first thing she did on arriving  there was to go into the kitchen and order the cook to prepare, at once,  a thoroughly good meal for her gallant rescuer--the Newfoundland dog,  which she had shut up securely in the back yard, with the laughing  remark, \"There--you can't escape me now.\" Judge of her astonishment,  however, when, on her return, the dog had gone. As the walls of the back  yard were twelve feet high, and the doors had been shut all the  while--no one having passed through them--it was impossible for the  animal to have escaped, and the only interpretation that could possibly  be put on the matter was that the dog was superphysical--a conclusion  that was subsequently confirmed by the experiences of various other  people. As the result of exhaustive enquiries Miss Lefanu eventually  learned that many years before, on the very spot where the tramps had  leaped out on her, a pedlar and his Newfoundland dog had been discovered  murdered.    This story being true, then, there is one more link in the chain of  evidence to show that dogs, as well as men, have spirits, and spirits  that can, on occasion, at least, perform deeds of practical service.      _A Precentor's Story_    The late Mr. W.T. Stead, in his volume of _Real Ghost Stories_, narrates  the following, which by reason of its being witnessed by three people  simultaneously, may be regarded as highly evidential.    In reply to Mr. Stead's request to hear the anecdote the precentor says  (I quote him _ad verbum_):    \"I was walking, about nine years ago, one night in August, about ten  o'clock, and about half a mile from the house where we are now sitting.  I was going along the public road between the hamlets of Mill of Haldane  and Ballock. I had with me two young women, and we were leisurely  walking along, when suddenly we were startled by seeing a woman, a child  about seven years old, and a Newfoundland dog jump over the stone wall  which was on one side of the road, and walk on rapidly in front of us. I  was not in the least frightened, but my two companions were very much  startled. What bothered me was that the woman, the child, and the dog,  instead of coming over the wall naturally one after the other, as would  have been necessary for them to do, had come over with a bound,  simultaneously leaping the wall, lighting on the road, and then hurrying  on without a word. Leaving my two companions, who were too frightened to  move, I walked rapidly after the trio. They walked on so quickly that it  was with difficulty that I got up to them. I spoke to the woman, she  never answered. I walked beside her for some little distance, and then  suddenly the woman, the child, and the Newfoundland dog disappeared. I  did not see them go anywhere, they simply were no longer there. I  examined the road minutely, at the spot where they had disappeared, to  see if it was possible for them to have gone through a hole in the wall  on either side; but it was quite impossible for a woman and a child to  get over a high dyke on either side. They had disappeared, and I only  regret that I did not try to pass my stick right through their bodies,  to see whether or not they had any resistance. Finding they had gone, I  returned to my lady friends, who were quite unnerved, and who, with  difficulty, were induced to go on to the end of their journey.\"    One of his companions, Mr. Stead goes on to explain, who heard him tell  the story at the time, corroborated the fact that it had made a great  impression on those who had seen it. Nothing was ever ascertained as to  any woman, child, or Newfoundland dog that had ever been in the district  before. When they got to Ballock they enquired of the keeper of the  bridge whether a woman, a child, and a dog had passed that way, but he  had seen nothing. The apparition had disappeared as suddenly as it had  appeared. Mr. Stead's article ends here. Of course, one can only surmise  as to the nature of the phenomena. No member of the Psychical Research  Society could do more--and in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#9)"],[1," the moat towards evening raises a dense cloud  of pigeons, \"obscuring utterly the waning day and deafening one with  the mighty rushing sound of countless strong and rapidly-plied  pinions.\" According to Hume the breeding season for these birds in  Upper India lasts from Christmas to May day. The experience of the  writer is that April, May and June are the months in which to look for  their nests. However, in justice to Hume, it must be said that  recently Mr. A. J. Currie found a nest, containing eggs, in February.    In April the green pigeons pair and build slender cradles, high up in  mango trees, in which two white eggs are laid.    The songster of the house-top--the brown rock-chat (_Cercomela  fusca_)--makes sweet music throughout the month for the benefit of his  spouse, who is incubating four pretty pale-blue eggs in a nest built  on a ledge in an outhouse or on the sill of a clerestory window. This  bird, which is thought by some to be a near relative of the sparrow of  the Scriptures, is clothed in plain brown and seems to suffer from St.  Vitus' dance in the tail. Doubtless it is often mistaken for a hen  robin. For this mistake there is no excuse, because the rock-chat  lacks the brick-red patch under the tail.    April is the month in which to look for two exquisite little  nests--those of the white-eye (_Zosterops palpebrosa_) and the iora  (_Aegithina tiphia_). White-eyes are minute greenish-yellow birds with  a conspicuous ring of white feathers round the eye. They go about in  flocks. Each individual utters unceasingly a plaintive cheeping note  by means of which it keeps its fellows apprised of its whereabouts. At  the breeding season, that is to say in April and May, the cock sings  an exceedingly sweet, but very soft, lay of six or seven notes. The  nest is a cup, about 2-1/2 inches in diameter and 3/4 of an inch in  depth. It is usually suspended, like a hammock, from the fork of a  branch; sometimes it is attached to the end of a single bough; it then  looks like a ladle, the bough being the handle. It is composed of  cobweb, roots, hair and other soft materials. Three or four tiny  pale-blue eggs are laid.    The iora is a feathered exquisite, about the size of a tomtit. The  cock is arrayed in green, black and gold; his mate is gowned in green  and yellow.    The iora has a great variety of calls, of these a soft and rather  plaintive long-drawn-out whistle is uttered most frequently in April  and May.    In shape and size the nest resembles an after-dinner coffee cup. It is  beautifully woven, and, like those of the white-eye and fantail  flycatcher, covered with cobweb; this gives it a very neat appearance.  In it are laid two or three eggs of salmon hue with reddish-brown and  purple-grey blotches.    Throughout April the sprightly tailor-birds are busy with their nests.  The tailor-bird (_Orthotomus sutorius_) is a wren with a long tail. In  the breeding season the two median caudal feathers of the cock project  as bristles beyond the others. The nest is a wonderful structure.  Having selected a suitable place, which may be a bush in a garden or a  pot plant in a verandah, the hen tailor-bird proceeds to make, with  her sharp bill, a series of punctures along the margins of one or more  leaves. The punctured edges are then drawn together, by means of  strands of cobweb, to form a purse or pocket. When this has been done  the frail bands of cobweb, which hold the edges of the leaves _in  situ_, are strengthened by threads of cotton. Lastly, the purse is  cosily lined with silk-cotton down or other soft material. Into the  cradle, thus formed, three or four white eggs, speckled with red, find  their way.    In April cavities in trees and buildings suitable for nesting purposes  are at a premium owing to the requirements of magpie-robins, brahminy  mynas, common mynas, yellow-throated sparrows and rollers. Not  uncommonly three or four pairs of birds nest in one weather-beaten old  tree.    Bank-mynas, white-breasted kingfishers, bee-eaters and a few belated  sand-martins are nesting in sandbanks in cavities which they  themselves have excavated. The nests of the kingfisher and the  sand-martin have already been described, that of the bank-myna belongs  to May rather than to April.    Bee-eaters working at the nest present a pleasing spectacle. The sexes  excavate turn about. The site chosen may be a bunker on the golf  links, the butts on the rifle range, a low mud boundary between two  fields, or any kind of bank. The sharp claws of the bee-eaters enable  the birds to obtain a foothold on an almost vertical surface; this  foothold is strengthened by the tail which, being stiff, acts as a  third leg. In a surprisingly short time a cavity large enough to  conceal the bird completely is formed. The bee-eater utilises the bill  as pickaxe and the feet as ejectors. The little clouds of sand that  issue at short intervals from each cavity afford evidence of the  efficacy of these implements and the industry of those that use them.    Two of the most charming birds in India are now occupied with family  cares. These are both black-and-white birds--the magpie-robin  (_Copsychus saularis_) and the pied wagtail (_Motacilla  maderaspatensis_). The former has already been noticed as the best  songster in the plains of India. The pattern of its plumage resembles  that of the common magpie; this explains its English name. The hen is  grey where the cock is black, otherwise there is no external  difference between the sexes. For some weeks the cock has been singing  lustily, especially in the early morning and late afternoon. In April  he begins his courtship. His display is a simple affair--mere  tail-play; the tail is expanded into a fan, so as to show the white  outer feathers, then it is either raised and lowered alternately, or  merely held depressed. Normally the tail is carried almost vertically.  The nest is invariably placed in a cavity of a tree or a building.    The pied wagtail always nests near water. If not on the ground, the  nursery rests on some structure built by man.    A visit to a bridge of boats in April is sure to reveal a nest of this  charming bird. Hume records a case of a pair of pied wagtails nesting  in a ferry-boat. This, it is true, was seldom used, but did  occasionally cross the Jumna. On such occasions the hen would continue  to sit, while the cock stood on the gunwale, pouring forth his sweet  song, and made, from time to time, little sallies over the water after  a flying gnat. Mr. A. J. Currie found at Lahore a nest of these  wagtails in a ferry-boat in daily use; so that the birds must have  selected the site and built the nest while the boat was passing to and  fro across the river!    Yet another black-and-white bird nests in April. This is the pied  bush-chat (_Pratincola caprata_). The cock is black all over, save for  a white patch on the rump and a bar of white in the wing. He delights  to sit on a telegraph wire or a stem of elephant grass and there make  cheerful melody. The hen is a dull reddish-grey bird. The nest is  usually placed in a hole in the ground or a bank or a wall, sometimes  it is wedged into a tussock of grass.    Allied to the magpie-robin and the pied bush-chat is the familiar  Indian robin (_Thamnobia cambayensis_), which, like its relatives, is  now engaged in nesting operations. This species constructs its  cup-shaped nest in all manner of strange places. Spaces in stacks of  bricks, holes in the ground or in buildings, and window-sills are held  in high esteem as nesting sites. The eggs are not easy to describe  because they display great variation. The commonest type has a pale  green shell, speckled with reddish-brown spots, which are most densely  distributed at the thick end of the egg.    Many of the grey partridges (_Francolinus pondicerianus_) are now  nesting. This species is somewhat erratic in respect of its breeding  season. Eggs have been taken in February, March, April, May, June,  September, October, and November. The April eggs, however, outnumber  those of all the other months put together. The nest is a shallow  depression in the ground, lined with grass, usually under a bush. From  six to nine cream-coloured eggs are laid.    Another bird which is now incubating eggs on the ground is the  did-he-do-it or red-wattled lapwing (_Sarcogrammus indicus_). The  curious call, from which this plover derives its popular name, is  familiar to every resident in India. This species nests between March  and August. The 122 eggs in the possession of Hume were taken, 12 in  March, 46 in April, 24 in May, 26 in June, 4 in July, and 8 in August.  Generally in a slight depression on the ground, occasionally on the  ballast of a rail-road, four pegtop-shaped eggs are laid; these are,  invariably, placed in the form of a cross, so that they touch each  other at their thin ends. They are coloured like those of the common  plover. The yellow-wattled lapwing (_Sarciophorus malabaricus_), which  resembles its cousin in manners and appearance, nests in April, May  and June.    The nesting season of the various species of sand-grouse that breed in  India is now beginning. These birds, like lapwings, lay their eggs on  the ground.    In April one may come across an occasional nest of the pied starling,  the king-crow, the paradise flycatcher, the grey hornbill, and the  oriole, but these are exceptions. The birds in question do not as a  rule begin to nest until May, and their doings accordingly are  chronicled in the calendar for that month.          MAY      The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year.                            _The Minstrelsy of the Woods_.
