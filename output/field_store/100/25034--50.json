She was a kind of Isis or  hospitable Hathor, whose subjects in the other world adapted themselves  to the nebulous and dreary existence provided for their disembodied  \"doubles.\" The Osirian and solar doctrines were afterwards blended  together in this local mythology, and from the XIth dynasty onwards the  Theban nobility had adopted, along with the ceremonies in use in the  Memphite period, the Heliopolitan beliefs concerning the wanderings  of the soul in the west, its embarkation on the solar ship, and its  resting-places in the fields of Ialu. The rock-tombs of the XVIIIth  dynasty demonstrate that the Thebans had then no different concept of  their life beyond the world from that entertained by the inhabitants  of the most ancient cities: they ascribed to that existence the same  inconsistent medley of contradictory ideas, from which each one might  select what pleased him best--either repose in a well-provisioned tomb,  or a dwelling close to Osiris in the middle of a calm and agreeable  paradise, or voyages with Ra around the world.*         * The Pyramid texts are found for the most part in the tombs       of Nofiru and Harhotpu; the texts of the Book of the Dead       are met with on the Theban coffins of the same period.    [Illustration: 060.jpg DECORATED WRAPPINGS OF A MUMMY]    The fusion of Ra and Amon, and the predominance of the solar idea which  arose from it, forced the theologians to examine more closely these  inconsistent notions, and to eliminate from them anything which might be  out of harmony with the new views. The devout servant of Amon, desirous  of keeping in constant touch with his god both here and in the other  would, could not imagine a happier future for his soul than in its going  forth in the fulness of light by day, and taking refuge by night on  the very bark which carried the object of his worship through the thick  darkness of, Hades. To this end he endeavoured to collect the formulae  which would enable him to attain to this supreme happiness, and also  inform him concerning the hidden mysteries of that obscure half of the  world in which the sun dwelt between daylight and daylight, teaching him  also how to make friends and supporters of the benevolent genii, and how  to avoid or defeat the monsters whom he would encounter. The best  known of the books relating to these mysteries contained a geographical  description of the future world as it was described by the Theban  priests towards the end of the Ramesside period; it was, in fact, an  itinerary in which was depicted each separate region of the underworld,  with its gates, buildings, and inhabitants.*         * The monumental text of this book is found sculptured on a       certain number of the tombs of the Theban kings. It was       first translated into English by Birch, then into French by       Deveria, and by Maspero.    The account of it given by the Egyptian theologians did not exhibit much  inventive genius. They had started with the theory that the sun, after  setting exactly west of Thebes, rose again due east of the city, and  they therefore placed in the dark hemisphere all the regions of the  universe which lay to the north of those two points of the compass. The  first stage of the sun's journey, after disappearing below the horizon,  coincided with the period of twilight; the orb travelled along the open  sky, diminishing the brightness of his fires as he climbed northward,  and did not actually enter the underworld till he reached Abydos,  close to the spot where, at the \"Mouth of the Cleft,\" the souls of the  faithful awaited him. As soon as he had received them into his boat,  he plunged into the tunnel which there pierces the mountains, and the  cities through which he first passed between Abydos and the Fayum were  known as the Osirian fiefs. He continued his journey through them for  the space of two hours, receiving the homage of the inhabitants, and  putting such of the shades on shore as were predestined by their special  devotion for the Osiris of Abydos and his associates, Horus and Anubis,  to establish themselves in this territory. Beyond Heracleopolis, he  entered the domains of the Memphite gods, the \"land of Sokaris,\" and  this probably was the most perilous moment of his journey.    [Illustration: 062.jpg ONE OF THE MYSTERIOUS BOOKS OF AMON]    The feudatories of Phtah were gathered together in grottoes, connected  by a labyrinth of narrow passages through which even the most fully  initiated were scarcely able to find their way; the luminous boat,  instead of venturing within these catacombs, passed above them by  mysterious tracks. The crew were unable to catch a glimpse of the  sovereign through whose realm they journeyed, and they in like manner  were invisible to him; he could only hear the voices of the divine  sailors, and he answered them from the depth of the darkness. Two hours  were spent in this obscure passage, after which navigation became easier  as the vessel entered the nomes subject to the Osirises of the Delta:  four consecutive hours of sailing brought the bark from the province in  which the four principal bodies of the god slept to that in which  his four souls kept watch, and, as it passed, it illuminated the eight  circles reserved for men and kings who worshipped the god of Mendes.  From the tenth hour onwards it directed its course due south, and passed  through the Augarit, the place of fire and abysmal waters to which the  Heliopolitans consigned the souls of the impious; then finally quitting  the tunnel, it soared up in the east with the first blush of dawn. Each  of the ordinary dead was landed at that particular hour of the twelve,  which belonged to the god of his choice or of his native town. Left to  dwell there they suffered no absolute torment, but languished in the  darkness in a kind of painful torpor, from which condition the approach  of the bark alone was able to rouse them. They hailed its daily coming  with acclamations, and felt new life during the hour in which its rays  fell on them, breaking out into lamentations as the bark passed away and  the light disappeared with it. The souls who were devotees of the sun  escaped this melancholy existence; they escorted the god, reduced though  he was to a mummied corpse, on his nightly cruise, and were piloted by  him safe and sound to meet the first streaks of the new day. As the  boat issued from the mountain in the morning between the two trees which  flanked the gate of the east, these souls had their choice of several  ways of spending the day on which they were about to enter. They might  join their risen god in his course through the hours of light, and  assist him in combating Apophis and his accomplices, plunging again at  night into Hades without having even for a moment quitted his side.    [Illustration: 066.jpg THE ENTRANCE TO A ROYAL TOMB]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph, by Beato, of the       tomb of Ramses IV.    [Illustration: 066b.jpg ONE OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT]    They might, on the other hand, leave him and once more enter the world  of the living, settling themselves where they would, but always by  preference in the tombs where their bodies awaited them, and where they  could enjoy the wealth which had been accumulated there: they might walk  within their garden, and sit beneath the trees they had planted; they  could enjoy the open air beside the pond they had dug, and breathe the  gentle north breeze on its banks after the midday heat, until the time  when the returning evening obliged them to repair once more to Abydos,  and re-embark with the god in order to pass the anxious vigils of the  night under his protection. Thus from the earliest period of Egyptian  history the life beyond the tomb was an eclectic one, made up of a  series of earthly enjoyments combined together.    The Pharaohs had enrolled themselves instinctively among the most ardent  votaries of this complex doctrine. Their relationship to the sun made  its adoption a duty, and its profession was originally, perhaps, one of  the privileges of their position. Ra invited them on board because they  were his children, subsequently extending this favour to those whom  they should deem worthy to be associated with them, and thus become  companions of the ancient deceased kings of Upper and Lower Egypt.*         * This is apparently what we gather from the picture       inserted in chapter xvii. of the \"Book of the Dead,\" where       we see the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt guiding the divine       bark and the deceased with them.    The idea which the Egyptians thus formed of the other world, and of the  life of the initiated within it, reacted gradually on their concept of  the tomb and of its befitting decoration. They began to consider the  entrances to the pyramid, and its internal passages and chambers, as a  conventional representation of the gates, passages, and halls of Hades  itself; when the pyramid passed out of fashion, and they had replaced  it by a tomb cut in the rock in one or other of the branches of the Bab  el-Moluk valley, the plan of construction which they chose was an exact  copy of that employed by the Memphites and earlier Thebans, and they  hollowed out for themselves in the mountain-side a burying-place on the  same lines as those formerly employed within the pyramidal structure.  The relative positions of the tunnelled tombs along the valley were not  determined by any order of rank or of succession to the throne; each  Pharaoh after Ramses I. set to work on that part of the rock where the  character of the stone favoured his purpose, and displayed so little  respect for his predecessors, that the workmen, after having tunnelled  a gallery, were often obliged to abandon it altogether, or to change the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#9)"],[1,"Euphrates, at the eastern extremity of Mount Bisuru, near       the frontier of the Laqi.         ** The country of Shugab is mentioned between Birejik (Tul-       Barsip) and Bit-Zamani, in one of the campaigns of       Shalmaneser III., which obliges us to place it in the caza       of Rum-kaleh; the name has been read Sumu.         *** Tul-Abni, which was at first sought for near the sources       of the Tigris, has been placed in the Mesopotamian plain.       The position which it occupies among the other names obliges       us to put it near Bit-Adini and Bit-Zamani: the only       possible site that I can find for it is at Orfah, the Edessa       of classical times.         **** The country of Harran is nowhere mentioned as belonging       either to Bit-Adini or to Tul-Abni: we must hence conclude       that at this period it formed a little principality       independent of those two states.         ^ The situation of Bit-Bakhiani is shown by the position       which it occupies in the account of the campaign, and by the       names associated with it in another passage of the _Annals_.    Bit-Zamani had belonged to Assyria by right of conquest ever since the  death of Ammibaal; Izalla and Bit-Bakhiani had fulfilled their duties  as vassals whenever Assur-nazir-pal had appeared in their neighbourhood;  Bit-Adini alone had remained independent, though its strength was more  apparent than real. The districts which it included had never been able  to form a basis for a powerful state. If by chance some small kingdom  arose within it, uniting under one authority the tribes scattered over  the burning plain or along the river banks, the first conquering  dynasty which sprang up in the neighbourhood would be sure to effect its  downfall, and absorb it under its own leadership. As Mitani, saved by  its remote position from bondage to Egypt, had not been able to escape  from acknowledging the supremacy of the Khati, so Bit-Adini was destined  to fall almost without a struggle under the yoke of the Assyrians. It  was protected from their advance by the volcanic groups of the Uraa and  Tul-Aba, which lay directly in the way of the main road from the marshes  of the Khabur to the outskirts of Tul-Barsip. Assur-nazir-pal, who might  have worked round this line of natural defence to the north through  Nirbu, or to the south through his recently acquired province of Laqi,  preferred to approach it in front; he faced the desert, and, in spite of  the drought, he invested the strongest citadel of Tul-Aba in the month  of June, 877 B.C. The name of the place was Kaprabi, and its inhabitants  believed it impregnable, clinging as it did to the mountain-side \"like  a cloud in the sky.\"*         * The name is commonly interpreted \"Great Rock,\" and divided       thus--Kap-rabi. It may also be considered, like Kapridargila       or Kapranisha, as being formed of _Kapru_ and _abi_; this       latter element appears to exist in the ancient name of       Telaba, Thallaba, now Tul-Aba. Kapr-abi might be a fortress       of the province of Tul-Aba.    The king, however, soon demolished its walls by sapping and by the use  of the ram, killed 800 of its garrison, burned its houses, and carried  off 2400 men with their families, whom he installed in one of the  suburbs of Calah. Akhuni, who was then reigning in Bit-Adini, had not  anticipated that the invasion would reach his neighbourhood: he at once  sent hostages and purchased peace by a tribute; the Lord of Tul-Abni  followed his example, and the dominion of Assyria was carried at a blow  to the very frontier of the Khati. It was about two centuries before  this that Assurirba had crossed these frontiers with his vanquished  army, but the remembrance of his defeat had still remained fresh in the  memory of the people, as a warning to the sovereign who should attempt  the old hazardous enterprise, and repeat the exploits of Sargon of Agade  or of Tiglath-pileser I. Assur-nazir-pal made careful preparations for  this campaign, so decisive a one for his own prestige and for the future  of the empire. He took with him not only all the Assyrian troops at his  disposal, but requisitioned by the way the armies of his most recently  acquired vassals, incorporating them with his own, not so much for the  purpose of augmenting his power of action, as to leave no force in his  rear when once he was engaged hand to hand with the Syrian legions.  He left Calah in the latter days of April, 876 B.C.,* receiving  the customary taxes from Bit-Bakhiani, Izalla, and Bit-Adini, which  comprised horses, silver, gold, copper, lead, precious stuffs, vessels  of copper and furniture of ivory; having reached Tul-Barsip, he accepted  the gifts offered by Tul-Abni, and crossing the Euphrates upon rafts of  inflated skins, he marched his columns against Oarchemish.         * On the 8th Iyyar, but without any indication of limmu, or       any number of the year or of the campaign; the date 876 B.C.       is admitted by the majority of historians.    The political organisation of Northern Syria had remained entirely  unaltered since the days when Tiglath-pileser made his first victorious  inroad into the country. The Cilician empire which succeeded to the  Assyrian--if indeed it ever extended as far as some suppose--did not  last long enough to disturb the balance of power among the various races  occupying Syria: it had subjugated them for a time, but had not been  able to break them up and reconstitute them. At the downfall of the  Cilician Empire the small states were still intact, and occupied, as of  old, the territory comprising the ancient Naharaim of the Egyptians, the  plateau between the Orontes and the Euphrates, the forests and marshy  lowlands of the Amanos, the southern slopes of Taurus, and the plains of  Cilicia.    [Illustration: 050.jpg CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN SYRIA]    Of these states, the most famous, though not then the most redoubtable,  was that with which the name of the Khati is indissolubly connected, and  which had Carchemish as its capital. This ancient city, seated on the  banks of the Euphrates, still maintained its supremacy there, but though  its wealth and religious ascendency were undiminished, its territory had  been curtailed. The people of Bit-Adini had intruded themselves between  this state and Kummukh, Arazik hemmed it in on the south, Khazazu  and Khalman confined it on the west, so that its sway was only freely  exercised in the basin of the Sajur. On the north-west frontier of the  Khati lay Gurgum, whose princes resided at Marqasi and ruled over the  central valley of the Pyramos together with the entire basin of the  Ak-su. Mikhri,* Iaudi, and Samalla lay on the banks of the Saluara, and  in the forests of the Amanos to the south of Gurgum. Kui maintained its  uneventful existence amid the pastures of Cilicia, near the marshes at  the mouth of the Pyramos. To the south of the Sajur, Bit-Agusi** barred  the way to the Orontes; and from their lofty fastness of Arpad, its  chiefs kept watch over the caravan road, and closed or opened it at  their will.         * Mikhri or Ismikhri, i.e. \"the country of larches,\" was the       name of a part of the Amanos, possibly near the Pyramos.         ** The real name of the country was Iakhanu, but it was       called Bit-Gusi or Bit-Agusi, like Bit-Adini, Bit-Bakhiani,       Bit-Omri, after the founder of the reigning dynasty. We must       place Iakhanu to the south of Azaz, in the neighbourhood of       Arpad, with this town as its capital.    They held the key of Syria, and though their territory was small in  extent, their position was so strong that for more than a century and  a half the majority of the Assyrian generals preferred to avoid this  stronghold by making a detour to the west, rather than pass beneath its  walls. Scattered over the plateau on the borders of Agusi, or hidden in  the valleys of Amanos, were several less important principalities, most  of them owing allegiance to Lubarna, at that time king of the Patina and  the most powerful sovereign of the district. The Patina had apparently  replaced the Alasia of Egyptian times, as Bit-Adini had superseded  Mitani; the fertile meadow-lands to the south of Samalla on the Afrin  and the Lower Orontes, together with the mountainous district between  the Orontes and the sea as far as the neighbourhood of Eleutheros, also  belonged to the Patina.    [Illustration: 052.jpg BAS-RELIEF FROM A BUILDING AT SINJIRLI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Perrot and Chipiez.    On the southern frontier of the Patina lay the important Phoenician  cities, Arvad, Arka, and Sina; and on the south-east, the fortresses  belonging to Hamath and Damascus. The characteristics of the country  remained unchanged. Fortified towns abounded on all sides, as well as  large walled villages of conical huts, like those whose strange outlines  on the horizon are familiar to the traveller at the present-day. The  manners and civilisation of Chaldaea pervaded even more than formerly the  petty courts, but the artists clung persistently to Asianic tradition,  and the bas-reliefs which adorned the palaces and temples were similar  in character to those we find scattered throughout Asia Minor; there  is the same inaccurate drawing, the same rough execution, the same  tentative and awkward composition.
