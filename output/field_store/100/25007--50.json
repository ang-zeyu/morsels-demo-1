Him We chose and rendered pure in this world:  And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous.    P: And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth  himself? Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he  is among the righteous.    S: And who forsakes the religion of Ibrahim but he who makes himself a  fool, and most certainly We chose him in this world, and in the  hereafter he is most surely among the righteous.    002.131  Y: Behold! his Lord said to him: \"Bow (thy will to Me):\" He said: \"I bow  (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe.\"    P: When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered  to the Lord of the Worlds.    S: When his Lord said to him, Be a Muslim, he said: I submit myself to  the Lord of the worlds.    002.132  Y: And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did  Jacob; \"Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not  except in the Faith of Islam.\"    P: The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, (saying):  O my sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) religion; therefore  die not save as men who have surrendered (unto Him).    S: And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and (so did) Yaqoub. O my  sons! surely Allah has chosen for you (this) faith, therefore die not  unless you are Muslims.    002.133  Y: Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said  to his sons: \"What will ye worship after me?\" They said: \"We shall  worship Thy god and the god of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma'il and  Isaac,- the one (True) Allah: To Him we bow (in Islam).\"    P: Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his  sons: What will ye worship after me? They said: We shall worship thy  god, the god of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One Allah,  and unto Him we have surrendered.    S: Nay! were you witnesses when death visited Yaqoub, when he said to  his sons: What will you serve after me? They said: We will serve your  God and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq, one  Allah only, and to Him do we submit.    002.134  Y: That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of  what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no  question in your case!    P: Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they  earned, and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of  what they used to do.    S: This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they  earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called  upon to answer for what they did.    002.135  Y: They say: \"Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (To  salvation).\" Say thou: \"Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham  the True, and he joined not gods with Allah.\"    P: And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided.  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of  Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters.    S: And they say: Be Jews or Christians, you will be on the right course.  Say: Nay! (we follow) the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was  not one of the polytheists.    002.136  Y: Say ye: \"We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to  Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses  and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no  difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in  Islam).\"    P: Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto  us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac,  and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and  that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no  distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered.    S: Say: We believe in Allah and (in) that which had been revealed to us,  and (in) that which was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and  Yaqoub and the tribes, and (in) that which was given to Musa and Isa,  and (in) that which was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do  not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit.    002.137  Y: So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path;  but if they turn back, it is they who are in schism; but Allah will  suffice thee as against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.    P: And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are  they rightly guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism,  and Allah will suffice thee (for defence) against them. He is the  Hearer, the Knower.    S: If then they believe as you believe in Him, they are indeed on the  right course, and if they turn back, then they are only in great  opposition, so Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the  Hearing, the Knowing.    002.138  Y: (Our religion is) the Baptism of Allah: And who can baptize better  than Allah? And it is He Whom we worship.    P: (We take our) colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at  colouring. We are His worshippers.    S: (Receive) the baptism of Allah, and who is better than Allah in  baptising? and Him do we serve.    002.139  Y: Say: Will ye dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord  and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours;  and that We are sincere (in our faith) in Him?    P: Say (unto the People of the Scripture): Dispute ye with us concerning  Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord? Ours are our works and yours  your works. We look to Him alone.    S: Say: Do you dispute with us about Allah, and He is our Lord and your  Lord, and we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds, and we  are sincere to Him.    002.140  Y: Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were  Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah? Ah! who is more  unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from Allah? but  Allah is not unmindful of what ye do!    P: Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the  tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah?  And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath  received from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what ye do.    S: Nay! do you say that Ibrahim and Ismail and Yaqoub and the tribes  were Jews or Christians? Say: Are you better knowing or Allah? And who  is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from Allah?  And Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.    002.141  Y: That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of  what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no  question in your case:    P: Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they  earned and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what  they used to do.    S: This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they  earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called  upon to answer for what they did.    002.142  Y: The fools among the people will say: \"What hath turned them from the  Qibla to which they were used?\" Say: To Allah belong both east and  West: He guideth whom He will to a Way that is straight.    P: The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the  qiblah which they formerly observed? Say: Unto Allah belong the East  and the West. He guideth whom He will unto a straight path.    S: The fools among the people will say: What has turned them from their  qiblah which they had? Say: The East and the West belong only to Allah;  He guides whom He likes to the right path.    002.143  Y: Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be  witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over  yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to  test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on  their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous,  except to those guided by Allah. And never would Allah Make your faith  of no effect. For Allah is to all people most surely full of kindness,  Most Merciful.    P: Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses  against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you.  And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We  might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his  heels. In truth it was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided.  But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith should be in vain, for  Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind.    S: And thus We have made you a medium (just) nation that you may be the  bearers of witness to the people and (that) the Messenger may be a  bearer of witness to you; and We did not make that which you would have  to be the qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the  Messenger from him who turns back upon his heels, and this was surely  hard except for those whom Allah has guided aright; and Allah was not  going to make your faith to be fruitless; most surely Allah is  Affectionate, Merciful to the people.    002.144  Y: We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens: now  Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy  face in the direction of the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your  faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that that is  the truth from their Lord. Nor is Allah unmindful of what they do.    P: We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O  Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a  qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable  Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be, turn your  faces (when ye pray) toward it. Lo! Those who have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#9)"],[1,"enough to beard a whole hunt--especially such a hunt as _ours_.'    'Finish the game first,' observed Captain Macer, who had rather the best of  it.    'No, leave the balls as they are till we come back,' rejoined Ned Stringer;  'we shall be late. See, it's only ten _to_, now,' continued he, pointing to  the timepiece above the fire; whereupon there was a putting away of cues,  hurrying on of coats, seeking of hats, sorting of sticks, and a general  desertion of the room for the railway station.    [Illustration: MR. SPONGE ARRIVES AT LAVERICK WELLS]          CHAPTER VII    OUR HERO ARRIVES AT LAVERICK WELLS      Punctual to the moment, the railway train, conveying the redoubtable  genius, glid into the well-lighted, elegant little station of Laverick  Wells, and out of a first-class carriage emerged Mr. Sponge, in a 'down the  road' coat, carrying a horse-sheet wrapper in his hand. So small and  insignificant did the station seem after the gigantic ones of London, that  Mr. Sponge thought he had wasted his money in taking a first-class ticket,  seeing there was no one to know. Mr. Leather, who was in attendance, having  received him hat in hand, with all the deference due to the master of  twenty hunters, soon undeceived him on that point. Having eased him of his  wrapper, and inquired about his luggage, and despatched a porter for a fly,  they stood together over the portmanteau and hat-box till it arrived.    'How are the horses?' asked Sponge.    'Oh, the osses be nicely, sir,' replied Leather; 'they travelled down  uncommon well, and I've had 'em both removed sin they com'd, so either on  'em is fit to go i' the mornin' that you think proper.'    'Where are the hounds?' asked our hero.    ''Ounds be at Whirleypool Windmill,' replied Leather, 'that's about five  miles off.'    'What sort of country is it?' inquired Sponge.    'It be a stiffish country from all accounts, with a good deal o' water  jumpin'; that is to say, the Liffey runs twistin' and twinin' about it like  a H'Eel.'    'Then I'd better ride the brown, I think,' observed Sponge, after a pause:  'he has size and stride enough to cover anything, if he will but face  water.'    'I'll warrant him for that,' replied Leather; 'only let the Latchfords well  into him, and he'll go.'    'Are there many hunting-men down?' inquired our friend casually.    'Great many,' replied Leather, 'great many; some good 'ands among 'em too;  at least to say their grums, though I never believe all these jockeys say.  There be some on 'em 'ere now,' observed Leather, in an undertone, with a  wink of his roguish eye, and jerk of his head towards where a knot of them  stood eyeing our friend most intently.    'Which?' inquired Sponge, looking about the thinly peopled station.    'There,' replied Leather, 'those by the book-stall. That be Mr. Waffles,'  continued he, giving his master a touch in the ribs as he jerked his  portmanteau into a fly, 'that be Mr. Waffles,' repeated he, with a knowing  leer.    'Which?' inquired Mr. Sponge eagerly.    'The gent in the green wide-awake 'at, and big-button'd overcoat,' replied  Leather, 'jest now a speakin' to the youth in the tweed and all tweed; that  be Master Caingey Thornton, as big a little blackguard as any in the  place--lives upon Waffles, and yet never has a good word to say for him,  no, nor for no one else--and yet to 'ear the little devil a-talkin' to him,  you'd really fancy he believed there wasn't not never sich another man i'  the world as Waffles--not another sich rider--not another sich  racket-player--not another sich pigeon-shooter--not another sich fine chap  altogether.'    'Has Thornton any horses?' asked Sponge.    'Not he,' replied Leather, 'not he, nor the gen'lman next him nouther--he,  in the pilot coat, with the whip sticking out of the pocket, nor the one in  the coffee-coloured 'at, nor none on 'em in fact'; adding, 'they all live  on Squire Waffles--breakfast with him--dine with him--drink with him--smoke  with him--and if any on 'em 'appen to 'ave an 'orse, why they sell to him,  and so ride for nothin' themselves.'    'A convenient sort of gentleman,' observed Mr. Sponge, thinking he, too,  might accommodate him.    The fly-man now touched his hat, indicative of a wish to be off, having a  fare waiting elsewhere. Mr. Sponge directed him to proceed to the Brunswick  Hotel, while, accompanied by Leather, he proceeded on foot to the stables.    Mr. Leather, of course, had the valuable stud under lock and key, with  every crevice and air-hole well stuffed with straw, as if they had been the  most valuable horses in the world. Having produced the ring-key from his  pocket, Mr. Leather opened the door, and having got his master in, speedily  closed it, lest a breath of fresh air might intrude. Having lighted a  lucifer, he turned on the gas, and exhibited the blooming-coated horses,  well littered in straw, showing that he was not the man to pay  four-and-twenty shillings a week for nothing. Mr. Sponge stood eyeing them  for some seconds with evident approbation.    'If any one asks you about the horses, you can say they are _mine_, you  know,' at length observed he casually, with an emphasis on the mine.    'In course,' replied Leather.    'I mean, you needn't say anything about their being _jobs_,' observed  Sponge, fearing Leather mightn't exactly 'take.'    'You trust me,' replied Leather, with a knowing wink and a jerk of his  elbow against his master's side; 'you trust me,' repeated he, with a look  as much as to say, 'we understand each other.'    'I've hadded a few to them, indeed,' continued Leather, looking to see how  his master took it.    'Have you?' observed Mr. Sponge inquiringly.    'I've made out that you've as good as twenty, one way or another,' observed  Leather; 'some 'ere, some there, all over in fact, and that you jest run  about the country, and 'unt with 'oever comes h'uppermost.'    'Well, and what's the upshot of it all?' inquired Mr. Sponge, thinking his  groom seemed wonderfully enthusiastic in his interest.    'Why, the hupshot of it is,' replied Leather, 'that the men are all mad,  and the women all wild to see you. I hear at my club, the Mutton Chop and  Mealy Potato Club, which is frequented by flunkies as well as grums, that  there's nothin' talked of at dinner or tea, but the terrible rich stranger  that's a comin', and the gals are all pulling caps, who's to have the first  chance.'    'Indeed,' observed Mr. Sponge, chuckling at the sensation he was creating.    'The Miss Shapsets, there be five on 'em, have had a game at fly loo for  you,' continued Leather, 'at least so their little maid tells me.'    'Fly _what_?' inquired Mr. Sponge.    'Fly loo,' repeated Leather, 'fly loo.'    Mr. Sponge shook his head. For once he was not 'fly.'    'You see,' continued Leather, in explanation, 'their father is one of them  tight-laced candlestick priests wot abhors all sorts of wice and  himmorality, and won't stand card playin', or gamblin', or nothin' o' that  sort, so the young ladies when they want to settle a point, who's to be  married first, or who's to have the richest 'usband, play fly loo. 'Sposing  it's at breakfast time, they all sit quiet and sober like round the table,  lookin' as if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, and each has a lump o'  sugar on her plate, or by her cup, or somewhere, and whoever can 'tice a  fly to come to her sugar first, wins the wager, or whatever it is they play  for.'    'Five on 'em,' as Leather said, being a hopeless number to extract any good  from, Mr. Sponge changed the subject by giving orders for the morrow.    Mr. Sponge's appearance being decidedly of the sporting order, and his  horses maintaining the character, did not alleviate the agitated minds of  the sporting beholders, ruffled as they were with the threatening,  vapouring insinuations of the coachman-groom, Peter Leather. There is  nothing sets men's backs up so readily, as a hint that any one is coming to  take the 'shine' out of them across country. We have known the most deadly  feuds engendered between parties who never spoke to each other by adroit  go-betweens reporting to each what the other said, or, perhaps, did not  say, but what the 'go-betweens' knew would so rouse the British lion as to  make each ride to destruction if necessary.    'He's a varmint-looking chap,' observed Mr. Waffles, as the party returned  from the railway station; 'shouldn't wonder if he can go--dare say he'll  try--shouldn't wonder if he's floored--awfully stiff country this for  horses that are not used to it--most likely his are Leicestershire nags,  used to fly--won't do here. If he attempts to take some of our big banked  bullfinches in his stride, with a yawner on each side, will get into  grief.'    'Hang him,' interrupted Caingey Thornton, 'there are good men in all  countries.'    'So there are!' exclaimed Mr. Spareneck, the steeple-chase rider.    'I've no notion of a fellow lording it, because he happens to come out of  Leicestershire,' rejoined Mr. Thornton.    'Nor I!' exclaimed Mr. Spareneck.    'Why doesn't he stay in Leicestershire?' asked Mr. Hoppey, now raising his  voice for the first time--adding, 'Who asked him here?'    'Who, indeed?' sneered Mr. Thornton.    In this mood our friends arrived at the Imperial Hotel, where there was  always a dinner the day before hunting--a dinner that, somehow, was served  up in Mr. Waffles's rooms, who was allowed the privilege of paying for all  those who did not pay for themselves; rather a considerable number, we  believe.    The best of everything being good enough for the guests, and profuse  liberality the order of the day, the cloth generally disappeared before a  contented audience, whatever humour they might have set down in. As the  least people can do who dine at an inn and don't pay their own shot, is to  drink the health of the man who does pay, Mr. Waffles was always lauded and  applauded to the skies--such "]]]
