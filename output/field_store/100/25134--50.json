[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#9)"],[1,"to labor in this Day in the Divine Vineyard! Is it not incumbent  upon us to arise and teach His Cause with such an ardor which no worldly  adversity can quell, nor any measure of success can satiate?          Election of Local Assemblies      And, now that this all-important Work may suffer no neglect, but rather  function vigorously and continuously in every part of the Baha'i world;  that the unity of the Cause of Baha'u'llah may remain secure and  inviolate, it is of the utmost importance that in accordance with the  explicit text of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book, in every locality,  be it city or hamlet, where the number of adult (21 years and above)  declared believers exceeds nine, a local \"Spiritual Assembly\" be forthwith  established. To it all local matters pertaining to the Cause must be  directly and immediately referred for full consultation and decision. The  importance, nay the absolute necessity of these local Assemblies is  manifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into  the local Houses of Justice, and at present provide the firm foundation on  which the structure of the Master's Will is to be reared in future.          Duties of Spiritual Assemblies      The matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its extension,  its consolidation, essential as they are to the interests of the Cause,  constitute by no means the only issue which should receive the full  attention of these Assemblies. A careful study of Baha'u'llah's and  'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets will reveal that other duties, no less vital to the  interests of the Cause, devolve upon the elected representatives of the  friends in every locality.    It is incumbent upon them to be vigilant and cautious, discreet and  watchful, and protect at all times the Temple of the Cause from the dart  of the mischief-maker and the onslaught of the enemy.    They must endeavor to promote amity and concord amongst the friends,  efface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement from  every heart, and secure in its stead an active and whole-hearted  cooperation for the service of the Cause.    They must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the  poor, the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of  color, caste and creed.    They must promote by every means in their power the material as well as  the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of  children, institute, whenever possible, Baha'i educational institutions,  organize and supervise their work and provide the best means for their  progress and development.    They must make an effort to maintain official, regular, and frequent  correspondence with the various Baha'i centers throughout the world,  report to them their activities, and share the glad-tidings they receive  with all their fellow-workers in the Cause.    They must encourage and stimulate by every means at their command, through  subscription, reports and articles, the development of the various Baha'i  magazines, such as the \"Star of the West\" and the \"Magazine of the  Children of the Kingdom\" in the United States of America, the \"Baha'i  News\" of India, the \"Sun of the East\" (Khurshid-i Khavar) in Turkestan,  the \"Star of the East\" in Japan, the \"Sun of Truth\" in Germany.    They must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the  friends, the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special  gatherings designed to serve and promote the social, intellectual and  spiritual interests of their fellow-men.    They must supervise in these days when the Cause is still in its infancy  all Baha'i publications and translations, and provide in general for a  dignified and accurate presentation of all Baha'i literature and its  distribution to the general public.    These rank among the most outstanding obligations of the members of every  Spiritual Assembly. In whatsoever locality the Cause has sufficiently  expanded, and in order to insure efficiency and avoid confusion, each of  these manifold functions will have to be referred to a special Committee,  responsible to that Assembly, elected by it from among the friends in that  locality, and upon whose work the Assembly will have to exercise constant  and general supervision.    These local Spiritual Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the  friends, and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from  standing aloof and assuming an indifferent or independent attitude, should  regard it his sacred duty to take part conscientiously and diligently, in  the election, the consolidation and the efficient working of his own local  Assembly.          National Assemblies      Regarding the establishment of \"National Assemblies,\" it is of vital  importance that in every country, where the conditions are favorable and  the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size, such  as America, Great Britain and Germany, that a \"National Spiritual  Assembly\" be immediately established, representative of the friends  throughout that country.    Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent  personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as  the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the  Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the  Cause in that country.    It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in  the course of time it shall evolve into the National House of Justice  (referred to in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will as the \"secondary House of Justice\"),  which according to the explicit text of the Testament will have, in  conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i  world, to elect directly the members of the International House of  Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the  affairs of the Movement throughout the world.    It is expressly recorded in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Writings that these National  Assemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that is, the friends  in every country must elect a certain number of delegates, who in their  turn will elect from among all the friends in that country the members of  the National Spiritual Assembly. In such countries, therefore, as America,  Great Britain and Germany, a fixed number of secondary electors must first  be decided upon (95 for America, including the Pacific Islands; 95 for  Germany; and 19 for Great Britain). The friends then in every locality  where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine must directly  elect its quota of secondary electors assigned to it in direct proportion  to its numerical strength. These secondary electors will then, either  through correspondence, or preferably by gathering together, and first  deliberating upon the affairs of the Cause throughout their country (as  the delegates to the Convention), elect from among all the friends in that  country nine who will be the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.    This National Spiritual Assembly, which, pending the establishment of the  Universal House of Justice, will have to be re-elected once a year,  obviously assumes grave responsibilities, for it has to exercise full  authority over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have to  direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God,  and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general.    Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country such as  the matter of translation and publication, the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the  Teaching Work, and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly  local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National  Assembly.    It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local  Assemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the  National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country,  which will bear to it the same relation as the local committees bear to  their respective local Assemblies.    With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is  strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration  and decision of the local Assembly, or whether it should fall under its  own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its  special attention. The National Spiritual Assembly will also decide upon  such matters which in its opinion should be referred to the Holy Land for  consultation and decision.    With these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously,  vigorously, and efficiently functioning throughout the Baha'i world, the  only means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have  been secured. And when this Supreme Body will have been properly  established, it will have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay  down the principle which shall direct, so long as it deems advisable, the  affairs of the Cause.          Annual Election of Assemblies      Pending its establishment, and to insure uniformity throughout the East  and throughout the West, all local Assemblies will have to be re-elected  once a year, during the first day of Ridvan, and the result of polling, if  possible, be declared on that day.    In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not fall a  prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its purity and  pristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with efficiency and  promptness, it is necessary that every one should conscientiously take an  active part in the election of these Assemblies, abide by their decisions,  enforce their decree, and cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task  of stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. The  members of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their  own likes and dislikes, their personal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#9)"],[1,"of light, and stars shining from  the horizon of perfection, and brilliant lamps shedding their radiance  upon men.\"            CONTRIBUTION OF THE WEST TO WORLD ORDER      In the light of these glowing tributes, these ardent hopes, these  soul-stirring promises, recorded by the pen of the Center of the Covenant,  is it surprising to find that the Author of the Covenant Himself has,  anticipating the great contribution which the West is destined to make to  the establishment of His World Order, made such a momentous statement in  His writings: \"In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in the  West have appeared the signs of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts,  O people, and be not of those who have turned a deaf ear to the  admonitions of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised.\"    'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, confirming this statement, has written: \"From the  beginning of time until the present day the light of Divine Revelation  hath risen in the East and shed its radiance upon the West. The  illumination thus shed hath, however, acquired in the West an  extraordinary brilliancy. Consider the Faith proclaimed by Jesus. Though  it first appeared in the East, yet not until its light had been shed upon  the West did the full measure of its potentialities become manifest.\" \"The  day is approaching when ye shall witness how, through the splendor of the  Faith of Baha'u'llah the West will have replaced the East, radiating the  light of divine guidance.\" \"The West hath acquired illumination from the  East, but, in some respects the reflection of the light hath been greater  in the Occident.\" \"The East hath, verily, been illumined with the light of  the Kingdom. Erelong will this same light shed a still greater  illumination through the potency of the teachings of God, and their souls  be set aglow by the undying fire of His love.\"    Invested, among its sister communities in East and West, with the primacy  conferred upon it by 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan; armed with the mandatory  provisions of His momentous Tablets; equipped with the agencies of a  quarter-century-old Administrative Order, whose fabric it has reared and  consolidated; encouraged by the marvelous success achieved by its daughter  communities throughout the Americas, a success which has sealed the  triumph of the first stage of that Plan; launched on a campaign of vaster  dimensions, of superior merit, of weightier potentialities, than any it  has hitherto initiated, a campaign destined to multiply its spiritual  progeny in distant lands and amidst divers races, the community of the  Most Great Name in the North American continent must arise, as it has  never before in its history, and demonstrate anew its capacity to perform  such deeds as are worthy of its high calling. Its members, the executors  of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Plan, the champion-builders of Baha'u'llah's embryonic  Order, the torchbearers of a world-girdling civilization, must, in the  years immediately ahead, bestir themselves, and, as bidden by  'Abdu'l-Baha, \"increase\" their exertions \"a thousandfold,\" lay bare  further vistas in the \"range\" of their \"future achievements\" and of their  \"unspeakably glorious\" mission, and hasten the day when, as prophesied by  Him, their community will \"find itself securely established upon the  throne of an everlasting dominion,\" when \"the whole earth\" will be stirred  and shaken by the results of its \"achievements\" and \"resound with the  praises of majesty and greatness,\" when America will \"evolve into a center  from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the  Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly  established.\"    In every state of the United States, in every province of the Dominion of  Canada, in every republic of Latin America, in each of the ten European  countries to which its inescapable responsibilities are insistently  calling it, this community, so blessed in the past, so promising at  present, so dazzling in its future destiny, must, if it would guard its  priceless birthright and enhance its heritage, forge ahead with equal  zeal, with unrelaxing vigilance, with indomitable courage, with tireless  energy, until the present stage of its mission is triumphantly concluded.            THE WORKINGS OF TWO SIMULTANEOUS PROCESSES      How could it forfeit its birthright or mar its heritage, when the country  from which the vast majority of its members have sprung, the great  republic of the West, government and people alike, is itself, through  experiment and trial, slowly, painfully, unwittingly and irresistibly  advancing towards the goal destined for it by both Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha? Indeed if we would read aright the signs of the times, and  appraise correctly the significances of contemporaneous events that are  impelling forward both the American Baha'i Community and the nation of  which it forms a part on the road leading them to their ultimate destiny,  we cannot fail to perceive the workings of two simultaneous processes,  generated as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic Age of our  Faith, each clearly defined, each distinctly separate, yet closely related  and destined to culminate, in the fullness of time, in a single glorious  consummation.    One of these processes is associated with the mission of the American  Baha'i Community, the other with the destiny of the American nation. The  one serves directly the interests of the Administrative Order of the Faith  of Baha'u'llah, the other promotes indirectly the institutions that are to  be associated with the establishment of His World Order. The first process  dates back to the revelation of those stupendous Tablets constituting the  Charter of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan. It was held in abeyance for  well-nigh twenty years while the fabric of an indispensable Administrative  Order, designed as a divinely appointed agency for the operation of that  Plan, was being constructed. It registered its initial success with the  triumphant conclusion of the first stage of its operation in the republics  of the Western Hemisphere. It signalized the opening of the second phase  of its development through the inauguration of the present teaching  campaign in the European continent. It must pass into the third stage of  its evolution with the initiation of the third Seven Year Plan, designed  to culminate in the establishment of the structure of the Administrative  Order in all the remaining sovereign states and chief dependencies of the  globe. It must reach the end of the first epoch in its evolution with the  fulfillment of the prophecy mentioned by Daniel in the last chapter of His  Book, related to the year 1335, and associated by 'Abdu'l-Baha with the  world triumph of the Faith of His Father. It will be consummated through  the emergence of the Baha'i World Commonwealth in the Golden Age of the  Baha'i Dispensation.    The other process dates back to the outbreak of the first World War that  threw the great republic of the West into the vortex of the first stage of  a world upheaval. It received its initial impetus through the formulation  of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, closely associating for the first  time that republic with the fortunes of the Old World. It suffered its  first setback through the dissociation of that republic from the newly  born League of Nations which that president had labored to create. It  acquired added momentum through the outbreak of the second World War,  inflicting unprecedented suffering on that republic, and involving it  still further in the affairs of all the continents of the globe. It was  further reinforced through the declaration embodied in the Atlantic  Charter, as voiced by one of its chief progenitors, Franklin D. Roosevelt.  It assumed a definite outline through the birth of the United Nations at  the San Francisco Conference. It acquired added significance through the  choice of the City of the Covenant itself as the seat of the newly born  organization, through the declaration recently made by the American  president related to his country's commitments in Greece and Turkey, as  well as through the submission to the General Assembly of the United  Nations of the thorny and challenging problem of the Holy Land, the  spiritual as well as the administrative center of the World Faith of  Baha'u'llah. It must, however long and tortuous the way, lead, through a  series of victories and reverses, to the political unification of the  Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to the emergence of a world government  and the establishment of the Lesser Peace, as foretold by Baha'u'llah and  foreshadowed by the Prophet Isaiah. It must, in the end, culminate in the  unfurling of the banner of the Most Great Peace, in the Golden Age of the  Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.            A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE AMERICAN BAHA'I COMMUNITY AND THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC      Might not a still closer parallel be drawn between the community singled  out for the execution of this world-embracing Plan, in its relation to its  sister communities, and the nation of which it forms a part, in its  relation to its sister nations? On the one hand is a community which ever  since its birth has been nursed in the lap of 'Abdu'l-Baha and been  lovingly trained by Him through the revelation of unnumbered Tablets,  through the dispatch of special and successive messengers, and through His  own prolonged visit to the North American continent in the evening of His  life. It was to the members of this community, the spiritual descendants  of the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age of our Faith, that He, whilst  sojourning in the City of the Covenant, chose to reveal the implications  of that Covenant. It was in the vicinity of this community's earliest  established center that He laid, with His own hands, the cornerstone of  the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the western world. It was to the  members of"]]]
