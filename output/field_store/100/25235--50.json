It was no  new experience to Sam Stay to find an unconcerned-looking detective  strolling along behind him; but for the first time in his life the  burglar was neither disconcerted nor embarrassed by these attentions.    The death of Thornton Lyne had been the most tragic blow which had  ever overtaken him. And if they had arrested him he would have been  indifferent. For this hang-dog criminal, with the long, melancholy  face, lined and seamed and puckered so that he appeared to be an old man,  had loved Thornton Lyne as he had loved nothing in his wild and barren  life. Lyne to him had been some divine creature, possessed gifts and  qualities which no other would have recognised in him. In Sam's eyes Lyne  could have done no wrong. By Sam Stay's standard he stood for all that  was beautiful in human nature.    Thornton Lyne was dead! Dead, dead, dead.    Every footfall echoed the horrible, unbelievable word. The man was  incapable of feeling--every other pain was deadened in this great  suffering which was his.    And who had been the cause of it all? Whose treachery had cut short this  wonderful life? He ground his teeth at the thought. Odette Rider! He  remembered the name. He remembered all the injuries she had done to this  man, his benefactor. He remembered that long conversation which Lyne and  he had had on the morning of Sam's release from prison and the plannings  which had followed.    He could not know that his hero was lying, and that in his pique and hurt  vanity he was inventing grievances which had no foundation, and offences  which had never been committed. He only knew that, because of the hate  which lay in Thornton Lyne's heart, justifiable hate from Sam's view, the  death of this great man had been encompassed.    He walked aimlessly westward, unconscious of and uncaring for his  shadower, and had reached the end of Piccadilly when somebody took him  gently by the arm. He turned, and as he recognised an acquaintance, his  thick lips went back in an ugly snarl.    \"It's all right, Sam,\" said the plain-clothes policeman with a grin.  \"There's no trouble coming to you. I just want to ask you a few  questions.\"    \"You fellows have been asking questions day and night since--since that  happened,\" growled Sam.    Nevertheless, he permitted himself to be mollified and led to a seat in  the Park.    \"Now, I'm putting it to you straight, Sam,\" said the policeman. \"We've  got nothing against you at the Yard, but we think you might be able to  help us. You knew Mr. Lyne; he was very decent to you.\"    \"Here, shut up,\" said Sam savagely. \"I don't want to talk about it. I  don't want to think about it! D'ye hear? He was the grandest fellow that  ever was, was Mr. Lyne, God bless him! Oh, my God! My God!\" he wailed,  and to the detective's surprise this hardened criminal buried his face in  his hands.    \"That's all right, Sam. I know he was a nice fellow. Had he any  enemies--he might have talked to a chap like you where he wouldn't have  talked to his friends.\"    Sam, red-eyed, looked up suspiciously.    \"Am I going to get into any trouble for talking?\" he said.    \"None at all, Sam,\" said the policeman quickly. \"Now, you be a good lad  and do all you can to help us, and maybe, if you ever get into trouble,  we'll put one in for you. Do you see? Did anybody hate him?\"    Sam nodded.    \"Was it a woman?\" asked the detective with studied indifference.    \"It was,\" replied the other with an oath. \"Damn her, it was! He treated  her well, did Mr. Lyne. She was broke, half-starving; he took her out of  the gutter and put her into a good place, and she went about making  accusations against him!\"    He poured forth a stream of the foulest abuse which the policeman had  ever heard.    \"That's the kind of girl she was, Slade,\" he went on, addressing the  detective, as criminals will, familiarly by their surnames. \"She ain't  fit to walk the earth----\"    His voice broke.    \"Might I ask her name?\" demanded Slade.    Again Sam looked suspiciously around.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"leave me to deal with her. I'll settle with her,  and don't you worry!\"    \"That would only get you into trouble, Sam,\" mused Slade. \"Just give us  her name. Did it begin with an 'R'?\"    \"How do I know?\" growled the criminal. \"I can't spell. Her name was  Odette.\"    \"Rider?\" said the other eagerly.    \"That's her. She used to be cashier in Lyne's Store.\"    \"Now, just quieten yourself down and tell me all Lyne told you about her,  will you, my lad?\"    Sam Stay stared at him, and then a slow look of cunning passed over his  face.    \"If it was her!\" he breathed. \"If I could only put her away for it!\"    Nothing better illustrated the mentality of this man than the fact that  the thought of \"shopping\" the girl had not occurred to him before. That  was the idea, a splendid idea! Again his lips curled back, and he eyed  the detective with a queer little smile.    \"All right, sir,\" he said. \"I'll tell the head-split. I'm not going to  tell you.\"    \"That's as it ought to be, Sam,\" said the detective genially. \"You can  tell Mr. Tarling or Mr. Whiteside and they'll make it worth your while.\"    The detective called a cab and together they drove, not to Scotland Yard,  but to Tarling's little office in Bond Street. It was here that the man  from Shanghai had established his detective agency, and here he waited  with the phlegmatic Whiteside for the return of the detective he had sent  to withdraw Sam Stay from his shadower.    The man shuffled into the room, looked resentfully from one to the other,  nodded to both, and declined the chair which was pushed forward for him.  His head was throbbing in an unaccountable way, as it had never throbbed  before. There were curious buzzes and noises in his ears. It was strange  that he had not noticed this until he came into the quiet room, to meet  the grave eyes of a hard-faced man, whom he did not remember having seen  before.    \"Now, Stay,\" said Whiteside, whom at least the criminal recognised, \"we  want to hear what you know about this murder.\"    Stay pressed his lips together and made no reply.    \"Sit down,\" said Tarling, and this time the man obeyed. \"Now, my lad,\"  Tarling went on--and when he was in a persuasive mood his voice was  silky--\"they tell me that you were a friend of Mr. Lyne's.\"    Sam nodded.    \"He was good to you, was he not?\"    \"Good?\" The man drew a deep breath. \"I'd have given my heart and soul to  save him from a minute's pain, I would, sir! I'm telling you straight,  and may I be struck dead if I'm lying! He was an angel on earth--my God,  if ever I lay me hands on that woman, I'll strangle her. I'll put her  out! I'll not leave her till she's torn to rags!\"    His voice rose, specks of foam stood on his lips his whole face seemed  transfigured in an ecstasy of hate.    \"She's been robbing him and robbing him for years,\" he shouted. \"He  looked after her and protected her, and she went and told lies about him,  she did. She trapped him!\"    His voice rose to a scream, and he made a move forward towards the desk,  both fists clenched till the knuckles showed white. Tarling sprang up,  for he recognised the signs. Before another word could be spoken, the man  collapsed in a heap on the floor, and lay like one dead.    Tarling was round the table in an instant, turned the unconscious man on  his back, and, lifting one eyelid, examined the pupil.    \"Epilepsy or something worse,\" he said. \"This thing has been preying on  the poor devil's mind--'phone an ambulance, Whiteside, will you?\"    \"Shall I give him some water?\"    Tarling shook his head.    \"He won't recover for hours, if he recovers at all,\" he said. \"If Sam  Stay knows anything to the detriment of Odette Rider, he is likely to  carry his knowledge to the grave.\"    And in his heart of hearts J. O. Tarling felt a little sense of  satisfaction that the mouth of this man was closed.          CHAPTER IX    WHERE THE FLOWERS CAME FROM      Where was Odette Rider? That was a problem which had to be solved. She  had disappeared as though the earth had opened and swallowed her up.  Every police station in the country had been warned; all outgoing ships  were being watched; tactful inquiries had been made in every direction  where it was likely she might be found; and the house at Hertford was  under observation day and night.    Tarling had procured an adjournment of the inquest; for, whatever might  be his sentiments towards Odette Rider, he was, it seemed, more anxious  to perform his duty to the State, and it was very necessary that no  prurient-minded coroner should investigate too deeply into the cause and  the circumstances leading up to Thornton Lyne's death, lest the suspected  criminal be warned.    Accompanied by Inspector Whiteside, he reexamined the flat to which the  bloodstained carpet pointed unmistakably as being the scene of the  murder. The red thumb prints on the bureau had been photographed and were  awaiting comparison with the girl's the moment she was apprehended.    Carrymore Mansions, where Odette Rider lived, were, as has been  described, a block of good-class flats, the ground floor being given over  to shops. The entrance to the flats was between two of these, and a  flight of stairs led down to the basement. Here were six sets of  apartments, with windows giving out to the narrow areas which ran  parallel to the side streets on either side of the block.    The centre of the basement consisted of a large concrete store-room,  about which were set little cubicles or cellars in which the tenants  stored such of their baggage, furniture, etc., as they did not need. It  was possible, he discovered, to pass from the corridor of the basement  flat, into the store room, and out through a door at the back of the  building into a small courtyard. Access to the street was secured through  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#9)"],[1,",  prevents his judging of the true tint until his colour has dried, when  he frequently finds it harsh and chalky, and out of tone with the rest  of his painting. As little gum as possible should be employed with it,  gum being inimical to its body, or whiteness. The best way of preparing  this pigment, as well as other terrene whites, so as to preserve their  opacity, is to grind them in simple water, and to add towards the end of  the grinding sufficient only of clear _cold_ jelly of gum tragacanth as  will connect them into a body, and attach them to the paper in painting.  Cold starch will answer the same purpose.    Constant white is a sulphate of baryta, found native and known under the  name of heavy-spar, or prepared artificially by adding sulphuric acid,  or a soluble sulphate, to a solution of a barytic salt. In the first  mode, if the white be not well purified from free acid, it is apt to act  injuriously on some pigments. Sulphate of baryta is often used for the  purpose of adulterating white lead, the native salt being ground to fine  powder, and washed with dilute sulphuric acid, by which its colour is  improved, and a little oxide of iron probably dissolved out. Whether  native or artificial, the compound is quite unaffected by impure air,  and is not poisonous.      LEAD WHITES    Comprise and are known under the names of:--_White lead_, _Flake white_  and _Body-white_, _Cremnitz_, or _Kremnitz_, _Crems_ or _Krems white_,  _London_ and _Nottingham white_, _Flemish white_, _Pattison's white_,  _Blanc d'argent_ or _Silver white_, _Ceruse_, _Dutch white_, _French  white_, _Venetian white_, _Hamburgh white_, _Kremser white_, _Sulphate  of lead_, &c.    The heaviest and whitest of these are the best, and in point of colour  and body, are superior to all other whites. When pure and properly  applied in oil and varnish, they are comparatively safe and durable,  drying well without addition; but excess of oil discolours them, and in  water-painting they are changeable even to blackness. Upon all vegetable  lakes, except those of madder, they have a destructive effect; and are  injurious to gamboge, as well as to those almost obsolete pigments, red  and orange leads, king's and patent yellow, massicot, and orpiment. With  ultramarine, however, red and orange vermilions, yellow and orange  chromes, yellow and orange and red cadmiums, aureolin, the ochres,  viridian and other oxides of chromium, Indian red &c., they compound  with little or no injury. Lead colours must not be employed in  water-colour or crayon painting, distemper, or fresco. The whites of  lead are carbonates of that metal, with two exceptions:--Flemish white  or the sulphate, and Pattison's white or the oxychloride. In using all  pigments of which lead is the basis, cleanliness is essential to health.    White lead, by which we must be understood to mean the carbonate, always  contains when commercially prepared a certain proportion of hydrated  oxide. The less of the latter there is present, the better does the  white cover, and the less liable is it to turn brown. The products  formed by precipitation have proved to be inferior in body: otherwise,  pure mono-carbonate of lead-oxide, obtained by mixing solutions of  carbonate of potash and a lead-salt, might be best adapted for a  pigment. However, such a carbonate has been lately produced by Mr.  Spence's process of passing carbonic acid gas into a caustic soda or  potash solution of lead, and for this white an opacity is claimed equal  to that of the ordinary compound.    Great as is the opacity of white lead, it is apt to lose that property  in some measure in course of time, and become more or less transparent.  If, over a series of dry oil-colour rubs of varied hues, there were  brushed sufficient white lead paint to utterly obscure them, after some  years those rubs would indistinctly appear, and by degrees become more  and more visible, until at last their forms--if not their very  colours--could be recognised. From this it would seem that white lead  must slowly but surely part with some of its carbonic acid, and be at  length converted into dicarbonate, a compound possessing less carbonic  acid, and less coating power.    Impure air, or sulphuretted hydrogen, browns or blackens white lead,  converting it partially or wholly into sulphide. It would appear from  the recent investigations of Dr. D. S. Price, that white lead is less  liable to be thus affected, when the pictures in which it is used are  exposed to a strong light; also, that when such pictures have so  suffered, a like exposure will restore them. We have ourselves noticed  the rapidity with which an oil rub of white lead that has been damaged  by foul gas, regains its former whiteness when submitted to air and  sunshine. The action of drying oils has been likewise proved to be very  powerful upon sulphide of lead, an exposure to light for a few days only  being sufficient to change a surface of it, coated with a thin layer of  boiled linseed oil, into a white one. Probably, these agents may have a  similar effect upon other pigments injured by sulphuretted hydrogen, and  many of the colours in paintings may be restored by treating them with  boiled linseed oil, and submitting them to a strong light. That the  result is due to oxidation, there can be no doubt. Indeed, the eminent  French chemist, M. Thénard, was consulted some years back upon the means  of bringing to their original whiteness the black spots which had formed  upon a valuable drawing, by the changing of the white lead, and  employed for that purpose oxygenated water. He had ascertained its power  of converting the black sulphide of lead into the white sulphate, and,  by touching the spots with a brush dipped in the fluid, soon succeeded  in restoring the drawing to its primitive state. Here, again, the use of  the agent might doubtless be extended to other colours, to which foul  air is inimical.    In oil painting white lead is essential in the ground, in dead  colouring, in the formation of tints of all colours, and in scumbling,  either alone or mixed with other pigments. It is also the best local  white, when neutralized with ultramarine or black; and it is the true  representative of light, when warmed with Naples yellow, or orange  vermilion or cadmium, or with a mixture of the yellow and either of the  orange pigments, according to the light.    Ordinary white lead is often mixed with considerable quantities of heavy  spar, gypsum, or chalk. These injure it in body and brightness, dispose  it to dry more slowly, keep its place less firmly, and discolour the oil  with which it is applied, as well as prevent it dissolving completely in  boiling dilute potash-ley, a test by which pure white lead may be known.    The adulteration of pigments, which we have in some instances found  practised to a large extent abroad, is comparatively unfrequent in our  own country, so far at least as regards the superior class of colours  employed by artists. As a rule, such colours when manufactured in  England may be fairly assumed to be genuine; and certainly the  respectable colourmen of the present day are not in the habit of  sophisticating them. We must bear testimony, indeed, to the zeal with  which they purvey, regardless of necessary expense, the choicest and  most perfect materials. This should be a matter of congratulation to the  painter, who must of necessity rely on the faith and honesty of his  colour-dealer; for if he were ever so good a chemist, it would be  impossible for him to analyse each pigment before proceeding to use it.  The fault must rest with himself, therefore, if, through a mistaken  economy, he do not frequent the best houses and pay the best prices. Of  a surety, the colours of the artist are not among those things in which  quality can, or should, be sacrificed to cheapness.    2. BLANC D'ARGENT, OR SILVER WHITE.    These are false appellations of a white lead, called also _French  white_. It is brought from Paris in the form of drops, is exquisitely  white, but of less body than flake white, and has all the properties of  the best white leads. Being subject to the same changes, it is unfit  for general use as a water-colour, though good in oil or varnish.    3. CREMNITZ WHITE,    Known likewise as _Kremnitz_, _Crems_, or _Krems white_, is a carbonate  of lead which derives its names from Kremnitz in Hungary, or Crems or  Krems in Austria. It is also called _Vienna white_, being brought from  Vienna in cakes of a cubical form. Cremnitz white is the brightest white  that is used in oil: it possesses rather less body than flake white,  because the particles are finer. When newly prepared, it gives out a  strong smell of vinegar.    4. FLAKE WHITE,    Called, when levigated, _Body white_, is an English white lead in the  form of scales or plates, sometimes grey on the surface. It takes its  name from its figure, is occasionally equal to Crems white in colour,  and generally surpasses in body all other white leads. In composition,  it is a mixture of protocarbonate and hydrated oxide of lead, the latter  decreasing the opacity of the product according to the greater  proportion in which it is present.    5. FLEMISH WHITE, OR SULPHATE OF LEAD    Is an exceedingly white precipitate from any solution of lead by  sulphuric acid, much resembling the blanc d'argent. It is inferior,  however, both in body and permanence to the ordinary carbonate. Hence,  white lead which has more or less been converted by sulphuretted  hydrogen into sulphide, and again been converted into sulphate by  oxidation, with a view to restoring its colour, becomes peculiarly  liable to the influence of impure air.    6. LONDON AND NOTTINGHAM WHITES.    The best of these do not essentially differ from each other, nor from  the white leads of other manufactories. The latter variety, being  prepared from flake white, is usually the greyer of the two.    7. PATTISON'"]]]
