The beauty of the day was of itself  sufficient to inspire philanthropy. Notwithstanding the frostiness of  the morning, the sun in his cloudless journey had acquired sufficient  power to melt away the thin covering of snow from every southern  declivity, and to bring out the living green which adorns an English  landscape even in mid-winter. Large tracts of smiling verdure contrasted  with the dazzling whiteness of the shaded slopes and hollows. Every  sheltered bank, on which the broad rays rested, yielded its silver rill  of cold and limpid water, glittering through the dripping grass; and  sent up slight exhalations to contribute to the thin haze that hung just  above the surface of the earth. There was something truly cheering in  this triumph of warmth and verdure over the frosty thraldom of winter;  it was, as the Squire observed, an emblem of Christmas hospitality,  breaking through the chills of ceremony and selfishness, and thawing  every heart into a flow. He pointed with pleasure to the indications of  good cheer reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farm-houses and  low thatched cottages. \"I love,\" said he, \"to see this day well kept by  rich and poor; it is a great thing to have one day in the year, at  least, when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go, and of  having, as it were, the world all thrown open to you; and I am almost  disposed to join with Poor Robin, in his malediction of every churlish  enemy to this honest festival:--              \"Those who at Christmas do repine,               And would fain hence despatch him,             May they with old Duke Humphry dine,               Or else may Squire Ketch catch 'em.\"    The Squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and  amusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower  orders, and countenanced by the higher: when the old halls of castles  and manor-houses were thrown open at daylight; when the tables were  covered with brawn, and beef, and humming ale; when the harp and the  carol resounded all day long, and when rich and poor were alike welcome  to enter and make merry.[G] \"Our old games and local customs,\" said he,  \"had a great effect in making the peasant fond of his home, and the  promotion of them by the gentry made him fond of his lord. They made the  times merrier, and kinder, and better; and I can truly say, with one of  our old poets,--              \"I like them well--the curious preciseness               And all-pretended gravity of those             That seek to banish hence these harmless sports,               Have thrust away much ancient honesty.    [Illustration]    \"The nation,\" continued he, \"is altered; we have almost lost our simple  true-hearted peasantry. They have broken asunder from the higher  classes, and seem to think their interests are separate. They have  become too knowing, and begin to read newspapers, listen to alehouse  politicians, and talk of reform. I think one mode to keep them in good  humour in these hard times would be for the nobility and gentry to pass  more time on their estates, mingle more among the country people, and  set the merry old English games going again.\"    Such was the good Squire's project for mitigating public discontent;  and, indeed, he had once attempted to put his doctrine in practice, and  a few years before had kept open house during the holidays in the old  style. The country people, however, did not understand how to play their  parts in the scene of hospitality; many uncouth circumstances occurred;  the manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country, and more  beggars drawn into the neighbourhood in one week than the parish  officers could get rid of in a year. Since then he had contented himself  with inviting the decent part of the neighbouring peasantry to call at  the hall on Christmas day, and distributing beef, and bread, and ale,  among the poor, that they might make merry in their own dwellings.    [Illustration]    We had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a  distance. A band of country lads without coats, their shirt-sleeves  fancifully tied with ribands, their hats decorated with greens, and  clubs in their hands, were seen advancing up the avenue, followed by a  large number of villagers and peasantry. They stopped before the hall  door, where the music struck up a peculiar air, and the lads performed a  curious and intricate dance, advancing, retreating, and striking their  clubs together, keeping exact time to the music; while one, whimsically  crowned with a fox's skin, the tail of which flaunted down his back,  kept capering round the skirts of the dance, and rattling a  Christmas-box with many antic gesticulations.    [Illustration]    The Squire eyed this fanciful exhibition with great interest and  delight, and gave me a full account of its origin, which he traced to  the times when the Romans held possession of the island; plainly proving  that this was a lineal descendant of the sword-dance of the ancients.  \"It was now,\" he said, \"nearly extinct, but he had accidentally met  with traces of it in the neighbourhood, and had encouraged its revival;  though, to tell the truth, it was too apt to be followed up by rough  cudgel-play and broken heads in the evening.\"    [Illustration]    After the dance was concluded, the whole party was entertained with  brawn and beef, and stout home-brewed. The Squire himself mingled among  the rustics, and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference  and regard. It is true I perceived two or three of the younger peasants,  as they were raising their tankards to their mouths when the Squire's  back was turned, making something of a grimace, and giving each other  the wink; but the moment they caught my eye they pulled grave faces, and  were exceedingly demure. With Master Simon, however, they all seemed  more at their ease. His varied occupations and amusements had made him  well known throughout the neighbourhood. He was a visitor at every  farm-house and cottage; gossiped with the farmers and their wives;  romped with their daughters; and, like that type of a vagrant bachelor,  the humble bee, tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country  round.    The bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and  affability. There is something genuine and affectionate in the gaiety of  the lower orders, when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of  those above them; the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth,  and a kind word or a small pleasantry, frankly uttered by a patron,  gladdens the heart of the dependant more than oil and wine. When the  Squire had retired the merriment increased, and there was much joking  and laughter, particularly between Master Simon and a hale, ruddy-faced,  white-headed farmer, who appeared to be the wit of the village; for I  observed all his companions to wait with open mouths for his retorts,  and burst into a gratuitous laugh before they could well understand  them.    [Illustration]    The whole house indeed seemed abandoned to merriment. As I passed to my  room to dress for dinner, I heard the sound of music in a small court,  and, looking through a window that commanded it, I perceived a band of  wandering musicians, with pandean pipes and tambourine; a pretty  coquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad, while  several of the other servants were looking on. In the midst of her sport  the girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window, and, colouring up,  ran off with an air of roguish affected confusion.

Without the door let sorrow lie,                  And if, for cold, it hap to die,                We'll bury't in a Christmas pye,                  And evermore be merry.                                   WITHERS'S _Juvenilia._          [Illustration: THE CHRISTMAS DINNER]      I had finished my toilet, and was loitering with Frank Bracebridge in  the library, when we heard a distant thwacking sound, which he informed  me was a signal for the serving up of the dinner. The Squire kept up  old customs in kitchen as well as hall; and the rolling-pin, struck upon  the dresser by the cook, summoned the servants to carry in the meats.    [Illustration]              Just in this nick the cook knock'd thrice,            And all the waiters in a trice              His summons did obey;            Each serving man, with dish in hand,            March'd boldly up, like our train-band,              Presented and away.[H]    [Illustration]    The dinner was served up in the great hall, where the Squire always held  his Christmas banquet. A blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped  on to warm the spacious apartment, and the flame went sparkling and  wreathing up the wide-mouthed chimney. The great picture of the crusader  and his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the  occasion; and holly and ivy had likewise been wreathed round the helmet  and weapons on the opposite wall, which I understood were the arms of  the same warrior. I must own, by the by, I had strong doubts about the  authenticity of the painting and armour as having belonged to the  crusader, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#9)"],[1,"as he swallowed  could be plainly seen by his companions.    Bill looked at his ally as if to confirm some sudden understanding  between them. They took Slone's attitude gravely and they wagged their  heads doubtfully, as they might have done had Slone just acquainted  them with a hopeless and deathless passion for a woman. It was  significant of the nature of riders that they accepted his attitude and  had consideration for his feelings. For them the situation subtly  changed. For weeks they had been three wild-horse wranglers on a hard  chase after a valuable stallion. They had failed to get even close to  him. They had gone to the limit of their endurance and of the outfit,  and it was time to turn back. But Slone had conceived that strange and  rare longing for a horse--a passion understood, if not shared, by all  riders. And they knew that he would catch Wildfire or die in the  attempt. From that moment their attitude toward Slone changed as subtly  as had come the knowledge of his feeling. The gravity and gloom left  their faces. It seemed they might have regretted what they had said  about the futility of catching Wildfire. They did not want Slone to see  or feel the hopelessness of his task.    \"I tell you, Lin,\" said Bill, \"your hoss Nagger's as good as when we  started.\"    \"Aw, he's better,\" vouchsafed the other rider. \"Nagger needed to lose  some weight. Lin, have you got an extra set of shoes for him?\"    \"No full set. Only three left,\" replied Lin, soberly.    \"Wal, thet's enough. You can keep Nagger shod. An' MEBBE thet red  stallion will get sore feet an' go lame. Then you'd stand a chance.\"    \"But Wildfire keeps travelin' the valleys--the soft ground,\" said Slone.    \"No matter. He's leavin' the country, an' he's bound to strike  sandstone sooner or later. Then, by gosh! mebbe he'll wear off them  hoofs.\"    \"Say, can't he ring bells offen the rocks?\" exclaimed Bill. \"Oh, Lordy!  what a hoss!\"    \"Boys, do you think he's leavin' the country?\" inquired Slone,  anxiously.    \"Sure he is,\" replied Bill. \"He ain't the first stallion I've chased  off the Sevier range. An' I know. It's a stallion thet makes for new  country, when you push him hard.\"    \"Yep, Lin, he's sure leavin',\" added the other comrade. \"Why, he's  traveled a bee-line for days! I'll bet he's seen us many a time.  Wildfire's about as smart as any man. He was born wild, an' his dam was  born wild, an' there you have it. The wildest of all wild creatures--a  wild stallion, with the intelligence of a man! A grand hoss, Lin, but  one thet'll be hell, if you ever ketch him. He has killed stallions all  over the Sevier range. A wild stallion thet's a killer! I never liked  him for thet. Could he be broke?\"    \"I'll break him,\" said Lin Slone, grimly. \"It's gettin' him thet's the  job. I've got patience to break a hoss. But patience can't catch a  streak of lightnin'.\"    \"Nope; you're right,\" replied Bill. \"If you have some luck you'll get  him--mebbe. If he wears out his feet, or if you crowd him into a narrow  canyon, or ran him into a bad place where he can't get by you. Thet  might happen. An' then, with Nagger, you stand a chance. Did you ever  tire thet hoss?\"    \"Not yet.\"    \"An' how fur did you ever run him without a break? Why, when we ketched  thet sorrel last year I rode Nagger myself--thirty miles, most at a  hard gallop. An' he never turned a hair!\"    \"I've beat thet,\" replied Lin. \"He could run hard fifty miles--mebbe  more. Honestly, I never seen him tired yet. If only he was fast!\"    \"Wal, Nagger ain't so durned slow, come to think of thet,\" replied  Bill, with a grunt. \"He's good enough for you not to want another hoss.\"    \"Lin, you're goin' to wear out Wildfire, an' then trap him somehow--is  thet the plan?\" asked the other comrade.    \"I haven't any plan. I'll just trail him, like a cougar trails a deer.\"    \"Lin, if Wildfire gives you the slip he'll have to fly. You've got the  best eyes for tracks of any wrangler in Utah.\"    Slone accepted the compliment with a fleeting, doubtful smile on his  dark face. He did not reply, and no more was said by his comrades. They  rolled with backs to the fire. Slone put on more wood, for the keen  wind was cold and cutting; and then he lay down, his head in his  saddle, with a goatskin under him and a saddle-blanket over him.    All three were soon asleep. The wind whipped the sand and ashes and  smoke over the sleepers. Coyotes barked from near in darkness, and from  the valley ridge came the faint mourn of a hunting wolf. The desert  night grew darker and colder.    The Stewart brothers were wild-horse hunters for the sake of trades and  occasional sales. But Lin Slone never traded nor sold a horse he had  captured. The excitement of the game, and the lure of the desert, and  the love of a horse were what kept him at the profitless work. His type  was rare in the uplands.    These were the early days of the settlement of Utah, and only a few of  the hardiest and most adventurous pioneers had penetrated the desert in  the southern part of that vast upland. And with them came some of that  wild breed of riders to which Slone and the Stewarts belonged. Horses  were really more important and necessary than men; and this singular  fact gave these lonely riders a calling.    Before the Spaniards came there were no horses in the West. Those  explorers left or lost horses all over the southwest. Many of them were  Arabian horses of purest blood. American explorers and travelers, at  the outset of the nineteenth century, encountered countless droves of  wild horses all over the plains. Across the Grand Canyon, however, wild  horses were comparatively few in number in the early days; and these  had probably come in by way of California.    The Stewarts and Slone had no established mode of catching wild horses.  The game had not developed fast enough for that. Every chase of horse  or drove was different; and once in many attempts they met with success.    A favorite method originated by the Stewarts was to find a water-hole  frequented by the band of horses or the stallion wanted, and to build  round this hole a corral with an opening for the horses to get in. Then  the hunters would watch the trap at night, and if the horses went in to  drink, a gate was closed across the opening. Another method of the  Stewarts was to trail a coveted horse up on a mesa or highland, places  which seldom had more than one trail of ascent and descent, and there  block the escape, and cut lines of cedars, into which the quarry was  ran till captured. Still another method, discovered by accident, was to  shoot a horse lightly in the neck and sting him. This last, called  creasing, was seldom successful, and for that matter in any method ten  times as many horses were killed as captured.    Lin Slone helped the Stewarts in their own way, but he had no especial  liking for their tricks. Perhaps a few remarkable captures of  remarkable horses had spoiled Slone. He was always trying what the  brothers claimed to be impossible. He was a fearless rider, but he had  the fault of saving his mount, and to kill a wild horse was a tragedy  for him. He would much rather have hunted alone, and he had been alone  on the trail of the stallion Wildfire when the Stewarts had joined him.    Lin Slone awoke next morning and rolled out of his blanket at his usual  early hour. But he was not early enough to say good-by to the Stewarts.  They were gone.    The fact surprised him and somehow relieved him. They had left him more  than his share of the outfit, and perhaps that was why they had slipped  off before dawn. They knew him well enough to know that he would not  have accepted it. Besides, perhaps they felt a little humiliation at  abandoning a chase which he chose to keep up. Anyway, they were gone,  apparently without breakfast.    The morning was clear, cool, with the air dark like that before a  storm, and in the east, over the steely wall of stone, shone a redness  growing brighter.    Slone looked away to the west, down the trail taken by his comrades,  but he saw nothing moving against that cedar-dotted waste.    \"Good-by,\" he said, and he spoke as if he was saying good-by to more  than comrades.    \"I reckon I won't see Sevier Village soon again--an' maybe never,\" he  soliloquized.    There was no one to regret him, unless it was old Mother Hall, who had  been kind to him on those rare occasions when he got out of the  wilderness. Still, it was with regret that he gazed away across the red  valley to the west. Slone had no home. His father and mother had been  lost in the massacre of a wagon-train by Indians, and he had been one  of the few saved and brought to Salt Lake. That had happened when he  was ten years old. His life thereafter had been hard, and but for his  sturdy Texas training he might not have survived. The last five years  he had been a horse-hunter in the wild uplands of Nevada and Utah.    Slone turned his attention to the pack of supplies. The Stewarts had  divided the flour and the parched corn equally, and unless he was  greatly mistaken they had left him most of the coffee and all of the  salt.    \"Now I hold that decent of Bill an' Abe,\" said Slone, regretfully. \"But  I could have got along without it better 'n they could.\"    Then he swiftly set about kindling a fire and getting a meal. In the  midst of his task a sudden ruddy brightness fell around him. Lin Slone  paused in his work to look up.    The sun had risen over the eastern wall.    \"Ah!\" he said, and drew a deep breath.    The cold, steely, darkling sweep of desert had been transformed. It was  now a world of red earth and gold rocks and purple sage, with  everywhere the endless straggling green cedars. A breeze whipped in,  making the fire roar softly. The sun felt warm on his cheek. And at the  moment he heard the whistle of his horse.    \"Good old Nagger!\" he said. \"I shore won't have to track you this  mornin'.\"    "]]]
