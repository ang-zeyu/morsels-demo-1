[Sidenote: Discontent growing.]  Several of his followers began to demand more radical reforms than he  was willing to grant. The autocracy exercised by Mr. Sen was strongly  objected to, and a constitution of the Somaj was demanded. Mr. Sen  openly maintained that heaven from time to time raises up men endowed  with special powers, and commissioned to introduce new forms or  \"dispensations\" of religion; and his conduct fully proved that he  regarded himself as far above his followers. Complaints became louder;  and although the eloquence and genius of Keshub were able to keep the  rebellious elements from exploding it was evident, as early as 1873,  that a crisis was approaching. This came in 1878, when Mr. Sen's  daughter was married to the Maharaja of Kuch Behar. The bride was not  fourteen, and the bridegroom was sixteen. Now, Mr. Sen had been earnest  and successful in getting the Brahmo Marriage Act passed, which ruled  that the lowest marriageable age for a woman was fourteen, and for a man  eighteen. Here was gross inconsistency. What could explain it?  \"Ambition,\" exclaimed great numbers; \"the wish to exalt himself and his  daughter by alliance with a prince.\" But Mr. Sen declared that he had  consented to the marriage in consequence of an express intimation that  such was the will of heaven. Mr. Sen denied miracles, but believed in  inspiration; and of his own inspiration he seems to have entertained no  doubt. We thus obtain a glimpse into the peculiar working of his mind.  Every full conviction, every strong wish of his own he ascribed to  divine suggestion. This put him in a position of extreme peril. It was  clear that an enthusiastic, imaginative, self-reliant nature like his  might thus be borne on to any extent of fanaticism.    [Sidenote: Revolt; a third Samaj.  \"New Dispensation.\"]  A great revolt from Mr. Sen's authority now took place, and the Sadharan  Samaj was organized in May, 1878. An appeal had been made to the members  generally, and no fewer than twenty-one provincial Samajes, with more  than four hundred members, male and female, joined the new society.  This number amounted to about two thirds of the whole body. Keshub and  his friends denounced the rebels in very bitter language; and yet, in  one point of view, their secession was a relief. Men of abilities equal,  and education superior, to his own had hitherto acted as a drag on his  movements; he was now delivered from their interference and could deal  with the admiring and submissive remnant as he pleased. Ideas that had  been working in his mind now attained rapid development. Within two  years the flag of the \"New Dispensation\" was raised; and of that  dispensation Mr. Sen was the undoubted head. Very daring was the  language Mr. Sen used in a public lecture regarding this new creation.  He claimed equality for it with the Jewish and Christian dispensations,  and for himself \"singular\" authority and a divine commission.    [Sidenote: Its creed.]  In the Creed of the New Dispensation the name of Christ does not occur.  The articles were as follows:         _a._ One God, one Scripture, one Church. _b._ Eternal progress of       the soul. _c._ Communion of prophets and saints. _d._ Fatherhood       and motherhood of God. _e._ Brotherhood of man and sisterhood of       woman. _f._ Harmony of knowledge and holiness, love and work, yoga       and asceticism in their highest development. _g._ Loyalty to       sovereign.    [Sidenote: Omission of Christ's name.]  The omission of Christ's name is the more remarkable because Mr. Sen  spoke much of him in his public lectures. He had said in May, 1879,  \"None but Jesus, none but Jesus, none but Jesus ever deserved this  precious diadem, India; and Jesus shall have it.\" But he clearly  indicated that the Christ he sought was an Indian Christ; one who was \"a  Hindu in faith,\" and who would help the Hindus to \"realize their  national idea of a yogi\" (ascetic).    [Sidenote: \"Motherhood of God.\"]  Let it be noted that, from the beginning of his career, Mr. Sen had  spoken earnestly of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of  man--though, these great conceptions are not of Hindu origin. It is  difficult to see why, in later days, he insisted so much on the  \"motherhood of God.\" Perhaps it was a repetition--he probably would have  called it an exaltation--of the old Hindu idea, prevalent especially  among the worshipers of Siva, that there is a female counterpart--a  Sakti--of every divinity. Or, possibly, it may have been to conciliate  the worshipers of Durga and Kali, those great goddesses of Bengal.    [Sidenote: Public proclamation said to be from God.]  A public proclamation was soon issued, purporting to be from God  himself, as India's mother. The whole thing was very startling; many,  even of Keshub's friends, declared it blasphemous. Next, in the \"Flag  Ceremony,\" the flag or banner of the New Dispensation received a homage  scarcely distinguishable from worship. Then--as if in strict imitation  of the ancient adoration of Agni, or Fire--a pile of wood was lighted,  clarified butter poured on it, and prayers addressed to it, ending  thus--\"O, brilliant Fire! in thee we behold our resplendent Lord.\" This  was, at least, symbolism run wild; and every one, except those who were  prepared to follow their leader to all lengths, saw that in a land like  India, wedded to idolatry, it was fearfully perilous.    [Sidenote: \"Apostolic Durbar.\"]  In March, 1881, Mr. Sen and his friends introduced celebrations which,  to Christian minds, seemed a distressing caricature of the Christian  sacraments. Other institutions followed; an Apostolic Durbar (Court of  Apostles), for instance, was established. There was no end to Mr. Sen's  inventiveness.    In a public lecture delivered in January, 1883, on \"Asia's message to  Europe,\" he elaborately expounded the idea that all the great religions  are of Asiatic origin, and that all of them are true, and that the one  thing required to constitute the faith of the future--the religion of  humanity--is the blending of all these varied Oriental systems into one.    [Sidenote: Inconsistencies between Mr. Sen's public and private  utterances.  Mr. Sen's policy of reserve.]  It was not easy to reconcile Mr. Sen's public utterances with his  private ones--though far be it from us to tax him with insincerity.  Thus, in an interview extending over two hours, which the writer and two  missionary friends had with him a week or so before the lecture now  referred to, he said he accepted as true and vital all the leading  doctrines of the Christian faith, with the exception of the resurrection  of Christ. But another fundamental difference remained--he avowedly  dissented from the orthodox creed in rejecting the miraculous element in  Scripture. At an interview I had with him some time before he earnestly  disclaimed all intention to put Christ on a level with Buddha or  Mohammed. \"I am educating my friends,\" he said, \"to understand and  approve of Christianity; I have not yet said my last word about Christ.\"  It is a solemn question, Had he said it when his career was ended? If  so, it was far from a satisfactory word. His policy of reserve and  adaptation had probably kept him from uttering all that was in his  heart; but it was a sorely mistaken policy. Had he temporized less he  would have accomplished more.    Since the death of Mr. Sen there has been a violent dispute between his  family and the \"Apostolic Durbar,\" on one side, and one of his ablest  followers, on the other; and the New Dispensation will probably split in  two, if it does not perish altogether.    [Sidenote: The Sadharan Samaj.]  In the meantime, the Sadharan Samaj, which broke off from Keshub's party  in 1878, has been going on with no small vigor. Vagaries, either in  doctrine or rites, have been carefully shunned; its partisans profess a  pure Theistic creed and labor diligently in the cause of social reform.  Their position is nearly that of Unitarian Christianity, and we fear  they are not at present approximating to the full belief of the Church  Catholic.    [Sidenote: Movements in western India.  Tenets of the Prarthana Sabha.]  Very similar in character to the Brahmo Somaj is the Prarthana Somaj in  western India. As far back as 1850, or a little earlier, there was  formed a society called the Prarthana Sabha (Prayer-meeting). Its  leading tenets were as follows:         1. I believe in one God. 2. I renounce idol-worship. 3. I will do       my best to lead a moral life. 4. If I commit any sin through the       weakness of my moral nature I will repent of it and ask the pardon       of God.    The society, after some time, began to languish; but in 1867 it was  revived under the name of Prarthana Somaj. Its chief branches are in  Bombay, Poona, Ahmedabad, and Surat.    [Sidenote: Arya Samaj.]  An interesting movement called the Arya Samaj was commenced a few years  ago by a Pandit--Dayanand Sarasvati. He received the Vedas as fully  inspired, but maintained that they taught monotheism--Agni, Indra, and  all the rest being merely different names of God. It was a desperate  effort to save the reputation of the ancient books; but, as all Sanskrit  scholars saw at a glance, the whole idea was a delusion. The Pandit is  now dead; and the Arya Samaj may not long survive him.    At the time we write we hear of an attempt to defend idolatry and caste  made by men of considerable education.    [Sidenote: Theosophists.]  The so-called \"Theosophists\" have, for several years, been active in  India. Of existing religions, Buddhism is their natural ally. They are  atheists. A combination which they formed with the Arya Samaj speedily  came to an end.    Lastly, the followers of Mr. Bradlaugh are diligent in supplying their  books to Indian students.    Poor India! No wonder if her mind is bewildered as she listens to such  a Babel "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#9)"],[1,"ehold, making three members of equal  grade, and to have no deputy for the Resident, or President of the  Regency. It may also be well to add the mother of the heir apparent  to the persons to be consulted in the selection of the members of the  regency, though she is a person of no mark or influence in either  public or private affairs at present.    The mother of the present King, his brother, the mother of the heir-  apparent, and the young heir-apparent himself will be enough to have  a voice in the selection.    I conclude that it will be the Governor-General's wish that the heir-  apparent should be placed on the throne immediately after the death  of his father, for the slightest hesitation or delay in this matter  would be mischievous in such a place as Lucknow. As soon as this is  done, I can proceed to consult about the nomination of the regency.  The members will, of course, be chosen from among the highest and  most able members of the aristocracy present at the capital, and they  can be installed in office the day they are chosen. I do not  apprehend any confusion or disturbance; but measures must be adopted  immediately to pay up arrears due to the establishments, and dismiss  all that are useless.    The, King is not worse--on the contrary, he is said to be better; but  the hot season may be too much for him. His present state, with a  minister weak in body and not very strong in mind, is very  unsatisfactory. Fortunately the harvest is unusually fine.

My Lord,    Dr. Bell, has relieved Dr. Leekie from his charge, and I am glad that  so able and experienced a medical officer has been appointed to it by  your Lordship, for he will have the means of doing much good here if  he can secure the confidence and esteem of his native patients. The  way has been well paved for him by Dr. Leekie, who, in professional  ability, large experience, and perfect frankness of character, is one  of the first men I have met; and I regret exceedingly that the King  has never manifested any wish to consult him or any other European  physician.    Being anxious that both Dr. Leekie and Dr. Bell should have an  opportunity of seeing the King, and forming some opinion as to his  state of health, I proposed that his Majesty should receive them at  the same time with Captain Bird on his taking leave previous to his  departure for Simla. As it is usual for the residency surgeon to wait  on his Majesty when he first enters on his charge and when he quits  it, I knew that such a proposal would not give rise to any feelings  of doubt or uneasiness, and he at once expressed his wish to see  them. Yesterday, about noon, all three went to the palace, and sat  for some time in conversation with the King. They found him much  better in bodily health than they expected, and in the course of  conversation, found no signs of any confusion of ideas, and are of  opinion that in the hands of a skilful European physician he would  soon be quite well. His Majesty is hypochondriac, and frequently  under the influence of the absurd delusions common to such persons;  but he is quite sane during long intervals, and on all subjects not  connected with such delusions.    When in health, the King never paid much attention to business, and  his illness is, therefore, less felt than it would have been in the  conduct of affairs; but it is nevertheless felt, and that in a very  vital part--the collection of the revenue. The expenses of Government  are about one hundred (100) lacs a-year; and the collections this  year have not amounted to more than sixty (60), owing to this  illness, and to a deficiency in the autumn harvests. All  establishments are greatly in arrears in consequence; and the King  has been obliged to make some heavy drafts upon the reserved fund  left him by his father. I only wish none had been made for a less  legitimate purpose. The parasites, by whom he has surrounded himself  exclusively, have, it is said, been drawing upon it still more  largely during the King's illness, under the apprehension of a speedy  dissolution. The minister is a weak man, who stands somewhat in awe  of these musicians and eunuchs, who have no fear of anybody but the  Resident, whom it is, of course, their interest to keep as much as  possible in the dark. As soon as his Majesty gets stronger, I shall  see him more frequently than I have yet done, and be better able to  judge of what prospect of amendment there may be while he reigns. If  he ever conversed with his male relations, or any of the gentlemen at  the capital worthy of his confidence, I should have more hope than I  now have.                  With great respect I remain            Your Lordship's obedient humble servant,                       (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.    To the Right Hon.  The Earl of Dalhousie, K.T.,  Governor-General of India.                     ___________________________________                                              Lucknow, 11th June, 1849.  My Dear Elliot,    It will be desirable to have at least the wing of a regiment sent as  soon as possible to Jhansee. Bukhut Sing, who was allowed to escape  after having been surrendered to Ellis at Kyrma, has been since  allowed to get too much a-head. He is aided by the Khereecha people  openly; and secretly, I fear, by some of the Powar Thakoors of Gigree  under the rose. There are four small fortified places between thirty  and forty miles west of Jhansee, and not far from the Sinde, held by  Powar Thakoors, who are a shade higher in caste than the Bondeylas;  and, in consequence, all the principal chiefs take their daughters in  marriage. They are needy, and as proud as Lucifer, and will always  eke out their means by robbery if they can. The Jhansee chief cannot  keep them in order without our aid. While I was there, they did not  venture to rob after the surrender of the Jylpoor man in September,  1844; and the Hareecha and Hyrwa people ventured only to send a few  highwaymen into the Gwalior state west of the Sinde river.    The Powar places I mean are Jignee, Odgow, and Belchree. There was a  fourth near them just as bad, called Nowneer; but the Thakoors of  that place are all well disposed towards the Jbansee chief, and are  obedient. All are in the Jhansee state. If the marauders are pressed  with energy and sagacity, they will be soon put down; and you may  rely upon the native chiefs not supporting them, though, from their  marriage connection, they may afford them an asylum secretly when  fugitives.    Who the Gwalior men are that are plundering I know not; but they are  men of no note, and, if pressed skilfully and rigorously in time,  will soon be put down. The chiefs may all be relied upon, I believe.  They are mere gangs of robbers; and you know how easily a fanatic or  successful robber may collect a body for plunder in any part of  India, where the danger of pursuit is small. Had they been dealt with  properly at first, they would never have got a-head so far: time has  been lost, and they will now give trouble, particularly at such a  season. The evil will be confined to the tract west of Jhansee  occupied by these Powars. The chiefs are to the east, north, and  south of Jhansee; and the marauders would be allowed to enter their  estates. The Governor-General need not feel uneasy about them. The  Nurwar chief was always needy, and disposed to keep and shelter  robbers. His few villages were resumed on his death last year, and  his widows pensioned; but some of his relations are, I conclude,  among the marauders. There is a wild tract west of the Sinde in the  Gwalior territory, to which the marauders will fly when hard pressed  in the Jhansee state.                     Yours sincerely,              (Signed)       W. H. SLEEMAN.    To H. M. Elliot, Esq.,       &c. &c.                 ___________________________________                                      Lucknow, 18th June, 1849.    My Dear Elliot,    I was writing the last sentence of a long Report on Oude affairs when  your note came in. There are some parts that will amuse, some that  will interest, and the whole gives, I believe, a fair exposition of  the evils, with a suggestion for the best remedy that I can think of.  It is the formation of a Board, consisting of a President and two  members nominated by the King, subject to the confirmation of the  Governor-General, and not to be dismissed without his Lordship's  previous sanction. This Board to make the settlement of the revenue  proposed when Lord Hardinge was here, and to have the carrying it  out.    This Board will be a substitute for the Regency, but not so good. The  King is well in body; and, unless he will abdicate, we cannot get the  minority for the Regency. I think, upon the whole, the Governor-  General will think the Report worth reading, and the remedy worth  considering. It will bring little additional trouble on Government,  but a good deal on the Resident, who will require to have had much  administrative experience.    Things are coming fast to the crisis, in which I must be called upon  to advise and act, a thing which the fiddlers and eunuchs dread. I  can't trust the Report in the office, and the hand may not be so  legible as I could wish.    The Court is very averse to the appointment of a successor to Wilcox;  and it is with reluctance they have kept on the native officers who  go on with the work. I told them either to keep them on or to pension  them. I don't think a successor should be urged upon them in the  present state of beggary to which they are reduced. Nobody sees any  use in it, while there are a vast number of useful things neglected  for want of funds; as to the instruments, the Court care nothing  about them,"]]]
