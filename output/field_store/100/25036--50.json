To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#9)"],[1,"garrisoned with Greeks, whose presence in  the old cities could not but be extremely galling to the Egyptians. This  was done by means of these new Greek cities, where the power by which  Egypt was governed was stronger by being united, and less hateful by  being out of sight. Seldom or never was so great a monarchy founded with  so little force and so little crime.    Ptolemy, however, did not attempt the difficult task of uniting the two  races, and of treating the conquered and the conquerors as entitled to  the same privileges. From the time of Necho and Psammetichus, many of  the Greeks who settled in Egypt intermarried with the natives, and very  much laid aside their own habits; and sometimes their offspring, after  a generation or two, became wholly Egyptian. By the Greek laws the  children of these mixed marriages were declared to be barbarians; not  Greeks but Egyptians, and were brought up accordingly. They left the  worship of Jupiter and Juno for that of Isis and Osiris, and perhaps the  more readily for the greater earnestness with which the Egyptian gods  were worshipped. We now trace their descendants by the form of their  skulls, even into the priestly families; and of one hundred mummies  covered with hieroglyphics, taken up from the catacombs near Thebes,  about twenty show a European origin, while of those from the tombs  near Memphis, seventy out of every hundred have lost their Koptic  peculiarities. It is easy to foresee that an important change would  have been wrought in the character of the people and in their political  institutions, if the Greek laws had been humane and wise enough to grant  to the children of mixed marriages the privileges, the education, and  thereby the moral feelings of the more favoured parent; and it is not  too much to suppose, if the Greek law of marriage had been altered by  Ptolemy, that within three centuries above half the nation would have  spoken the Greek language, and boasted of its Greek origin.    [Illustration: 055.jpg THE GOD SERAPIS]    The stimulus given by Ptolemy Soter to the culture of the age has been  already mentioned. The founding of the famous museum and library  of Alexandria may be, perhaps, regarded as the rounding-off of his  political plans for the consolidation of his kingdom. Alexandria became,  in fact, not only a centre of commerce and government, but also the  intellectual capital of the Greeks. But for this supreme importance of  the city, it is doubtful whether the descendants of Ptolemy Lagus could  have continued to rule the Valley of the Nile.    In return for the literature which Greece then gave to Egypt, she gained  the knowledge of papyrus, a tall rush which grows wild near the sources  of the Nile, and was then cultivated in the Egyptian marshes. Before  that time books had been written on linen, wax, bark, or the leaves of  trees; and public records on stone, brass, or lead: but the knowledge of  papyrus was felt by all men of letters like the invention of printing  in modern Europe. Books were then known by many for the first time,  and very little else was afterwards used in Greece or Rome; for, when  parchment was made about two centuries later, it was too costly to be  used as long as papyrus was within reach. Copies were multiplied on  frail strips of this plant, and it was found that mere thoughts, when  worth preserving, were less liable to be destroyed by time than temples  and palaces of the hardest stone.    [Illustration: 056.jpb MANUSCRIPT ON PAPYRUS; HIEROGLYPHICS, THEBES]    While Egypt, under Ptolemy, was thus enjoying the advantages of its  insulated position, and cultivating the arts of peace, the other  provinces were being harassed by the unceasing wars of Alexander's  generals, who were aiming, like Ptolemy, at raising their own power.  Many changes had taken place among them in the short space of eight  years which had passed since the death of Alexander. Philip Arridaeus,  in whose name the provinces had been governed, had been put to death;  Antigonus was master of Asia Minor, with a kingdom more powerful though  not so easily guarded as Egypt; Cassander held Macedonia, and had the  care of the young Alexander AEgus, who was then called the heir to the  whole of his father's wide conquests, and whose life, like that of  Arridaeus, was soon to end with his minority; Lysimachus was trying  to form a kingdom in Thrace; and Seleucus had for a brief period held  Babylonia.    Ptolemy bore no part in the wars which brought about these changes,  beyond being once or twice called upon to send troops to guard his  province of Cole-Syria.    [Illustration: 057.jpg Alexander adoring Horus]    But Antigonus, in his ambitious efforts to stretch his power over all  the provinces, had by force or by treachery driven Seleucus out of  Babylon, and forced him to seek Egypt for safety, where Ptolemy received  him with the kindness and good policy which had before gained so many  friends. No arguments of Seleucus were wanting to persuade Ptolemy that  Antigonus was dreaming of universal conquest, and that his next attack  would be upon Egypt. He therefore sent ambassadors to make treaties of  alliance with Cassander and Lysimachus, who readily joined him against  the common enemy.    The large fleet and army which Antigonus got together for the invasion  of Egypt proved his opinion of the strength and skill of Ptolemy. All  Syria, except one or two cities, laid down its arms before him on his  approach. But he found that the whole of the fleet had been already  removed to the ports of Egypt, and he ordered Phoenicia to furnish him  with eight thousand shipbuilders and carpenters, to build galleys from  the forests of Lebanon and Antilibanus, and ordered Syria to send four  hundred and fifty thousand medimni, or nearly three millions of bushels  of wheat, for the use of his army within the year. By these means he  raised his fleet to two hundred and forty-three long galleys or ships of  war.    Ptolemy was for a short time called off from the war in Syria by a  rising in Cyrene. The Cyrenians, who clung to their Doric love of  freedom, and were latterly smarting at its loss, had taken arms and were  besieging the Egyptian, or, as they would have called themselves, the  Macedonian garrison, who had shut themselves up in the citadel. He at  first sent messengers to order the Cyrenians to return to their duty;  but his orders were not listened to; the rebels no doubt thought  themselves safe, as his armies seemed more wanted on the eastern  frontier; his messengers were put to death, and the siege of the citadel  pushed forward with all possible speed. On this he sent a large land  force, followed by a fleet, in order to crush the revolt at a single  blow; and the ringleaders were brought to Alexandria in chains. Magas, a  son of Queen Berenice and stepson of Ptolemy, was then made governor of  Cyrene.    When this trouble at home was put an end to, Ptolemy crossed over to  Cyprus to punish the kings of the little states on that island for  having joined Antigonus. For now that the fate of empires was to be  settled by naval battles the friendship of Cyprus became very important  to the neighbouring states. The large and safe harbours gave to this  island a great value in the naval warfare between Egypt, Phoenicia, and  Asia Minor. Alexander had given it as his opinion that the command  of the sea went with the island of Cyprus. When he held Asia Minor he  called Cyprus the key to Egypt; and with still greater reason might  Ptolemy, looking from Egypt, think that island the key to Phoenicia.  Accordingly he landed there with so large a force that he met with no  resistance. He added Cyprus to the rest of his dominions: he banished  the kings, and made Nicocreon governor of the whole island.    From Cyprus, Ptolemy landed with his army in Upper Syria, as the  northern part of that country was called, while the part nearer to  Palestine was called Coele-Syria. Here he took the towns of Posideion  and Potami-Caron, and then marching hastily into Asia Minor he took  Malms, a city of Cilicia. Having rewarded his soldiers with the booty  there seized, he again embarked and returned to Alexandria. This inroad  seems to have been meant to draw off the enemy from Coele-Syria; and it  had the wished-for effect, for Demetrius, who commanded the forces of  his father Antigonus in that quarter, marched northward to the relief  of Cilicia, but he did not arrive there till Ptolemy's fleet was already  under sail for its return journey to Egypt.    Ptolemy, on reaching Alexandria, set his army in motion towards  Pelusium, on its way to Palestine. His forces were eighteen thousand  foot and four thousand horse, part Macedonians, as the Greeks living in  Egypt were always called, and part mercenaries, followed by a crowd of  Egyptians, of whom some were armed for battle, and some were to take  care of the baggage. He had twenty-two thousand Greeks, and was met at  Gaza by the young Demetrius with an army of eleven thousand foot and  twenty-three hundred horse, followed by forty-three elephants and a  body of light-armed barbarians, who, like the Egyptians in the army of  Ptolemy, were not counted. But the youthful courage of Demetrius was no  match for the cool skill and larger army of Ptolemy; the elephants were  easily stopped by iron hurdles, and the Egyptian army, after gaining a  complete victory, entered Gaza, while Demetrius fled to Azotus. Ptolemy,  in his victory, showed a generosity unknown in modern warfare; he not  only gave leave to the conquered army to bury their dead, but sent back  the whole of the royal baggage which had fallen into his hands, and also  those personal friends of Demetrius who were found among the prisoners;  that is to say, all those who wished to depart, as the larger part of  these Greek armies were equally ready to fight on either side.

During the first century and a half of Roman sway in Egypt the school  of Alexandria was nearly silent. We have a few poems by Leonides of  Alexandria, one of which is addressed to the Empress Poppaea, as the wife  of Jupiter, on his presenting a celestial globe to her on her birthday.  Pamphila wrote a miscellaneous history of entertaining stories, and her  lively, simple style makes us very much regret its loss. Chaeremon, a  Stoic philosopher, had been, during the last reign, at the head of the  Alexandrian library, but he was removed to Rome as one of the tutors to  the young Nero.    [Illustration: 059.jpg COIN OF NERO]    He is ridiculed by Martial for writing in praise of death, when, from  age and poverty, he was less able to enjoy life. We still possess a  most curious though short account by him of the monastic habits of the  ancient Egyptians. He also wrote on hieroglyphics, and a small fragment  containing his opinion of the meanings of nineteen characters still  remains to us. But he is not always right; he thinks the characters were  used allegorically for thoughts, not for sounds; and fancies that the  priests used them to keep secret the real nature of the gods.    He was succeeded at the museum by his pupil Dionysius, who had the  charge of the library till the reign of Trajan. Dionysius was also  employed by the prefect as a secretary of state, or, in the language of  the day, secretary to the embassies, epistles, and answers. He was the  author of the _Periegesis_, and aimed at the rank of a poet by writing  a treatise on geography in heroic verse. From this work he is named  Dionysius Periegetes. While careful to remind us that his birthplace  Alexandria was a Macedonian city, he gives due honour to Egypt and the  Egyptians. There is no river, says he, equal to the Nile for carrying  fertility and adding to the happiness of the land. It divides Asia from  Libya, falling between rocks at Syene, and then passing by the old and  famous city of Thebes, where Memnon every morning salutes his beloved  Aurora as she rises. On its banks dwells a rich and glorious race of  men, who were the first to cultivate the arts of life; the first to make  trial of the plough and sow their seed in a straight furrow; and the  first to map the heavens and trace the sloping path of the sun.    According to the traditions of the church, it was in this reign that  Christianity was first brought into Egypt by the Evangelist Mark, the  disciple of the Apostle Peter. Many were already craving for religious  food more real than the old superstitions. The Egyptian had been shaken  in his attachment to the sacred animals by Greek ridicule. The Greek had  been weakened in his belief of old Homer's gods by living with men  who had never heard of them. Both were dissatisfied with the scheme of  explaining the actions of their gods by means of allegory. The crumbling  away of the old opinions left men more fitted to receive the new  religion from Galilee. Mark's preaching converted crowds in Alexandria;  but, after a short stay, he returned to Rome, in about the eleventh  year of this reign, leaving Annianus to watch over the growing church.  Annianus is usually called the first bishop of Alexandria; and Eusebius,  who lived two hundred years later, has given us the names of his  successors in an unbroken chain. If we would inquire whether the early  converts to Christianity in Alexandria were Jews, Greeks, or Egyptians,  we have nothing to guide us but the names of these bishops. Annianus,  or Annaniah, as his name was written by the Arabic historians, was very  likely a Jew; indeed, the Evangelist Mark would begin by addressing  himself to the Jews, and would leave the care of the infant church to  one of his own nation. In the platonic Jews, Christianity found soil  so exactly suited to its reception that it is only by he dates that the  Therapeute of Alexandria and their historian Philo are proved not to be  Christian; and, again, it was in the close union between the platonic  Jews and the platonists that Christianity found its easiest path to the  ears and hearts of the pagans. The bishops that followed seem to have  been Greek converts. Before the death of Annaniah, Jerusalem had been  destroyed by the Roman armies, and the Jews sunk in their own eyes  and in those of their fellow-citizens throughout the empire; hence the  second bishop of Alexandria was less likely to be of Hebrew blood; and  it was long before any Egyptians aimed at rank in the church. But though  the spread of Christianity was rapid, both among the Greeks and the  Egyptians, we must not hope to find any early traces of it in the  historians. It was at first embraced by the unlearned and the poor,  whose deeds and opinions are seldom mentioned in history; and we may  readily believe the scornful reproach of the unbelievers, that it was  chiefly received by the unfortunate, the unhappy, the despised, and the  sinful. When the white-robed priestesses of Ceres carried the sacred  basket through the streets of Alexandria, they cried out, \"Sinners away,  or keep your eyes to the ground; keep your eyes to the ground!\" When  the crier, standing on the steps of the portico in front of the great  temple, called upon the pagans to come near and join in the celebration  of their mysteries, he cried out, \"All ye who are clean of hands and  pure of heart, come to the sacrifice; all ye who are guiltless in  thought and deed, come to the sacrifice.\"    But many a repentant sinner and humble spirit must have drawn back in  distrust from a summons which to him was so forbidding, and been glad  to hear the good tidings of mercy offered by Christianity to those who  labour and are heavy laden, and to the broken-hearted who would turn  away from their wickedness. While such were the chief followers of the  gospel, it was not likely to be much noticed by the historians; and we  must wait till it forced its way into the schools and the palace before  we shall find many traces of the rapidity with which it was spreading.    [Illustration: 063.jpg ETHIOPIAN ARABS]    During these reigns the Ethiopian Arabs kept up their irregular warfare  against the southern frontier. The tribe most dreaded were the Blemmyes,  an uncivilised people, described by the affrighted neighbours as having  no heads, but with eyes and mouth on the breast; and it was under that  name that the Arabs spread during each century farther and farther into  Egypt, separating the province from the more cultivated tribes of Upper  Ethiopia or Meroe. The cities along the banks of the Nile in Lower  Ethiopia, between Nubia and Meroe, were ruined by being in the debatable  land between the two nations. The early Greek travellers had counted  about twenty cities on each side of the Nile between Syene and Meroe;  but when, in a moment of leisure, the Roman government proposed to  punish and stop the inroads of these troublesome neighbours, and sent  forward a tribune with a guard of soldiers, he reported on his return  that the whole country was a desert, and that there was scarcely a  city inhabited on either side of the Nile beyond Nubia. But he had not  marched very far. The interior of Africa was little known; and to seek  for the fountain of the Nile was another name for an impossible or  chimerical undertaking.    But Egypt itself was so quiet as not to need the presence of so large  a Roman force as usual to keep it in obedience; and when Vespasian, who  commanded Nero's armies in Syria, found the Jews more obstinate in their  rebellion and less easily crushed than he expected, the emperor sent the  young Titus to Alexandria, to lead to his father's assistance all the  troops that could be spared. Titus led into Palestine through Arabia two  legions, the Fifth and the Tenth, which were then in Egypt.    We find a temple of this reign in the oasis of Dakleh, or the Western  Oasis, which seems to have been a more flourishing spot in the time  of the Romans than when Egypt itself was better governed. It is so far  removed from the cities in the valley of the Nile that its position, and  even existence, was long unknown to Europeans, and to such hiding-places  as this many of the Egyptians fled, to be farther from the tyranny of  the Roman tax-gatherers.    Hitherto the Roman empire had descended for just one hundred years  through five emperors like a family inheritance; but, on the death of  Nero, the Julian and Claudian families were at an end, and Galba, who  was raised to the purple by the choice of the soldiers, endeavoured to  persuade the Romans and their dependent provinces that they had regained  their liberties. The Egyptians may have been puzzled by the word  _freedom_, then struck upon the coins by their foreign masters, but must  have been pleased to find it accompanied with a redress of grievances.    Galba began his reign with the praiseworthy endeavour of repairing the  injustice done by his cruel predecessor. He at once recalled the prefect  of Egypt, and appointed in his place Tiberius Julius Alexander, an  Alexandrian, a son of the former prefect of that name; and thus Egypt  was under the government of a native prefect. The peaceable situation of  the Great Oasis has saved a long Greek inscription of the decree which  was now issued in redress of the grievances suffered under Nero. It is  a proclamation by Julius Demetrius, the commander of the Oasis, quoting  the decree of Tiberius Julius Alexander, the new prefect of Egypt.    The prefect acknowledges that the loud complaints with which he was met  on entering upon his government were well founded, and he promises that  the"]]]
