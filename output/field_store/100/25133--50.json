'Send out Thy  Light and Thy Truth O God: Let them lead us to the Holy Mountains!' May we  be refreshed by the holy springs that are renewing the life of the world!  As day follows night, and after sunset comes the dawn, so Jesus Christ  appeared on the horizon of this world like a Sun of Truth; even so when  the people--after forgetting the teachings of Christ and His example of  love to all humanity--had again grown tired of material things, a heavenly  Star shone once more in Persia, a new illumination appeared and now a  great light is spreading throughout all lands.    \"Men keep their possessions for their own enjoyment and do not share  sufficiently with others the bounty received from God. Spring is thus  changed into the winter of selfishness and egotism. Jesus Christ said 'Ye  must be born again' so that divine Life may spring anew within you. Be  kind to all around and serve one another; love to be just and true in all  your dealings; pray always and so live your life that sorrow cannot touch  you. Look upon the people of your own race and those of other races as  members of one organism; sons of the same Father; let it be known by your  behaviour that you are indeed the people of God. Then wars and disputes  shall cease and over the world will spread the Most Great Peace.\"    After 'Abdu'l-Baha had retired Tamaddun'ul-Mulk and Mr. W. Tudor Pole gave  short addresses in which references were made to the martyrdom of the  faithful in Persia, special mention being made of the eminent poetess  Qurratu'l-'Ayn.    The next day was a bright Sunday and 'Abdu'l-Baha went out with his  friends driving and walking on the downs. Afterwards he gathered the  servants of the house together, spoke of the dignity of labour and thanked  them for their service, giving to each some remembrance of his visit. He  went over the Guest house and blessed it as a centre for pilgrims from  every part of the world, and said it would become indeed a House of Rest.    On the morning of the third day, a Canon of the Anglican Church met him at  breakfast. The conversation turned on the reluctance of the rich to part  with their possessions, 'Abdu'l-Baha, quoting the saying of Jesus, \"How  hardly shall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.\" He  remarked that only when the true seeker finds that attachments to the  material are keeping him from his spiritual heritage, will he gladly enter  the way of renunciation. Then will the rich man joyfully share his worldly  possessions with the needy. 'Abdu'l-Baha contrasted the unpretentious  hospitality before him with the costly banquets of the wealthy, who too  often sit at their feasts forgetting the hungry multitudes.    He urged his hearers to spread the light in their own homes so that  finally it would illuminate the whole community.    'Abdu'l-Baha then returned to London. It was the earnest wish of those who  had the privilege of meeting him that his followers in other lands should  know how much the Clifton people appreciated his visit and realized his  spiritual power and love.    Thomas Pole.            AT BYFLEET.      On the afternoon of September 9th, a number of working women of the  Passmore Edwards' Settlement, who were spending their holidays with Miss  Schepel and Miss Buckton at Vanners, in Byfleet, a village some twenty  miles out of London, had the great privilege of meeting 'Abdu'l-Baha. They  wrote a short record of his sayings to keep for themselves. The following  is an extract:--    We gathered round him in a circle, and he made us sit beside him in the  window seat. One of the members, who was ill, had a specially beautiful  greeting from him. 'Abdu'l-Baha began by saying, as he seated himself:  \"Are you happy?\" and our faces must have shown him that we were. He then  said: \"I love you all, you are the children of the Kingdom, and you are  accepted of God. Though you may be poor here, you are rich in the  treasures of the Kingdom. I am the Servant of the poor. Remember how His  Holiness Jesus said: 'Blessed are the poor!' If all the queens of the  earth were gathered here, I could not be more glad!\"    'Abdu'l-Baha knew that we had a treasury box from which we try to help  people less fortunate than ourselves. Presently he rose, and said: \"You  are dear to me. I want to do something for you! I cannot cook for you (he  had previously seen us busy in the kitchen) but here is something for your  fund.\" He went round the circle to each, with a beautiful smile, shaking  hands with all, and giving the Baha'i greeting: \"Allah'u'Abha!\"    Later on he walked in the village, and many poor children came to him, and  mothers with sick babies and men out of work. He spoke to them all,  through an interpreter. At tea-time other friends joined us. 'Abdu'l-Baha  liked the cottage garden at Vanners, the little orchard and the roses. He  said: \"This is like a Persian garden. The air is very pure.\"    On leaving for London he presented every one with a purple heartsease from  the garden, and said again and again: \"Good-bye\" in English.    On the 28th September, 'Abdu'l-Baha again visited Vanners, the little farm  house on the old royal manor that dates back to the time of Edward II. He  motored down from London and stayed over night, returning on the evening  of the second day.    'Abdu'l-Baha was much struck during the drive by two detachments of Boy  Scouts tramping the road. When told of the Scouts' motto, \"Be Prepared,\"  and that an act of kindness each day is one of their laws and that some of  these boys had put out a fire and assisted at a recent railway accident,  he said. \"This makes me very happy.\"    Arriving at Vanners, he found a large, strangely mixed crowd, assembled  about the gate to welcome him, from the quite poor to the wealthy who had  motored over from their country places. A great number followed him and as  many as could do so pressed into the garden and sat down around him. The  silence was most impressive. The same attention and eagerness to hear was  noticed among the people each time 'Abdu'l-Baha appeared in the village.    After expressing his joy at being with them, he began to speak to the  little group in answer to a question about the elaborate civilization of  the West.            THE CAPTIVITY OF MAN      'Abdu'l-Baha said:--\"Luxuries cut off the freedom of communication. One who  is imprisoned by desires is always unhappy; the children of the Kingdom  have unchained themselves from their desires. Break all fetters and seek  for spiritual joy and enlightenment; then, though you walk on this earth,  you will perceive yourselves to be within the divine horizon. To man alone  is this possible. When we look about us we see every other creature  captive to his environment.    \"The bird is a captive in the air and the fish a captive in the sea. Man  alone stands apart and says to the elements, I will make you my servants!  I can govern you! He takes electricity, and through his ingenuity  imprisons it and makes of it a wonderful power for lighting, and a means  of communication to a distance of thousands of miles. But man himself may  become a captive to the things he has invented. His true second birth  occurs when he is freed from all material things: for he only is free who  is not a captive to his desires. He has then as Jesus has said, become  captive to the Holy Spirit.\"            THE POWER OF GOD      A friend asked 'Abdu'l-Baha how far the individual could attain to that  Christ consciousness in himself of which St. Paul speaks as our hope of  Glory.    'Abdu'l-Baha turned with a look of great joy and said with an impressive  gesture: \"The bounty and power of God is limitless for each human soul.  Consider what was the quickening power of the Christ when He was on earth.  Look at His disciples! They were poor and uncultured men. Out of the rough  fisherman He made the great Peter, and out of the poor village girl of  Magdala He made one who is a power in all the world today. Many queens  have reigned who are remembered by their dates in history, and nothing  more is known of them. But Mary the Magdalene is greater than them all. It  was she whose love strengthened the disciples when their faith was  failing. What she did for the world cannot be measured. See what a divine  power was enkindled in her by the power of God!\"            INSPIRED MESSENGERS      When asked if it would be always necessary for prophets to come from time  to time--\"would not the world in the course of events through progress  reach to a full realization of God?\"--'Abdu'l-Baha replied: \"Mankind needs  a universal motive power to quicken it. The inspired messenger who is  directly assisted by the power of God brings about universal results.  Baha'u'llah rose as a light in Persia and now that light is going out to  the whole world.\"    \"Is this what is meant by the Second Coming of Christ?\" \"Christ is an  Expression of the Divine Reality, the Single Essence and Heavenly Entity,  which hath no beginning or ending. It has appearance, arising, and  manifestation and setting in each one of the Cycles.\"    Those who have been with 'Abdu'l-Baha notice how, often, after speaking  earnestly with people, he will suddenly turn and walk away to be alone. At  such times no one follows him. On this occasion, when he finished speaking  and went out through the orchard gate into the village, all were struck  with his free and wonderful walk which has been described by one of our  American friends as that of a shepherd or a king.    As he passed along the ragged children clustered about him by dozens, the  boys saluting him as they had been taught in school, showing how  instinctively they felt the greatness of his presence. Most noticeable was  the silence of even the roughest men when 'Abdu'l-Baha appeared. One poor  tramp exclaimed \"He is a good man,\" and added, \"Ay, he's suffered!\"    He took particular interest in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#9)"],[1,"rendering our glorious Faith in Australia, and particularly Perth,  during the past two years. Your trip has been of real assistance to the  teaching work, and it pleased him greatly.    Regarding Mr. ...: it was with the approval of the Guardian that his name  was removed from the voting list. It is very bad for the Cause to have a  member of the Community, actively, in the public eye, teaching the Faith,  and at the same time showing dishonest characteristics. We cannot possibly  say that because a person also has many virtues, faults as grave as lying  and dishonourable conduct regarding money, can be overlooked! This means  that we tolerate as representatives of our Faith people who flagrantly  disobey its laws and fundamental teachings. This does not mean there is no  hope for Mr. ...; let him change his conduct, if he really loves the  Cause, and then a way will be opened for him to again be active. But the  change must be real and obvious; mere protestations will serve no purpose.    He urges you to continue your services in the teaching field in New  Zealand, and also to write to the friends in Australia who are disturbed  about Mr. ..., and strengthen their faith and determination.    With warmest greetings,  R. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Almighty, Whose Cause you serve with such zeal and devotion,  reward you for your labours, and graciously assist you to win great  victories for His Faith and its institutions,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (39) December 18th, 1949      Dear Baha'i Brother:    Your letter of November 1st was received, and, although our beloved  Guardian is so busy at present on the Shrine work here that his mail is  piling up alarmingly, he does want to send you a word of appreciation for  your fine, constructive spirit and the services you are rendering the  Faith.    Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity. But its root is lack of faith in  the system of Baha'u'llah (i.e. the administrative order) and lack of  obedience to Him--for He has forbidden it. If the Baha'is would follow the  Baha'i laws in voting, in electing, in serving, and in abiding by assembly  decisions, all this waste of strength thru criticizing others could be  diverted into cooperation and achieving the Plan. Keep on trying to point  this out to them!    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Assuring you of my loving prayers for the success of every effort you  exert for the promotion of our beloved Faith, and the realization of every  desire you cherish for its progress,_    _Your true and grateful brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (40) June 11th, 1952      Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your two letters of May 25th have been received, and the beloved Guardian  thanks you for them, and for the loving sympathy which you express.    He hopes that you will make every effort to attend the New Delhi  Conference, as it will be a very historic occasion, and the more Baha'is  from Australia and New Zealand that are present, the better.    You should get in touch with the Indian National Spiritual Assembly as  regards accommodation etc.    This has been a very tiring winter for the beloved Guardian. He has had so  many pilgrims, and so many problems locally, and an ever-increasing amount  of work, so I will make this letter brief.    He assures you your services are deeply appreciated, and that he will  remember you in his prayers.    With warm Baha'i greetings,  R.

He is happy to know that the New Zealand Haziratu'l-Quds is being made  attractive for the many activities that will take place in this Center,  and he hopes it will become the means of the greatest unity and loving  cooperation among the friends.    He assures all the friends in New Zealand of his deep appreciation of  their devoted services.    With warm Baha'i greetings,  R.

(42) March 31st, 1926      Dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  Feb. 18th 1926. He well appreciates the whole-hearted contributions the  friends, the world over, have made to safeguard the neighbourhood of the  shrines. We all hope that this spirit of quick response and action will  permeate all the different activities of the Cause.    Shoghi Effendi as well as the other members of the family send you, and  through you, the Australian and New Zealand friends their best love and  greetings. They all await the good news of the progress of the Movement in  Australasia.    With loving greetings I remain,  Yours very sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear fellow-worker,_    _I fully appreciate the self-sacrificing efforts of the New-Zealand  Baha'is and am glad to inform them that the surroundings of the Shrines on  Mt Carmel are secure. May the Beloved reward them a hundredfold!

He has already received and cashed the first draft and has sent you the  receipt for it.    He appreciates very much indeed the help of the New Zealand friends and I  am sure they would all be very glad to know that the surroundings of the  holy Shrines on Mt Carmel have already been safeguarded. This is such a  relief to Shoghi Effendi and all the friends who feared lest the  approaches should fall into the hands of speculators and interested men.    With heartfelt greetings to the friends in New Zealand. I am    Yours ever in His Service,  Soheil Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear fellow-worker:_    _I wish to reassure you in person of my continued prayers for you as well  as for those friends who in the distant city of Auckland are labouring for  the advancement of the Cause in New Zealand.

He also wishes me to ask you to kindly inform Mrs Blundell of the receipt  of the twenty five copies of the Maori pamphlet which she had lately  mailed to him. These, together with those she had sent previously, have  all been placed in his own library, and a few copies have also been placed  in the Mansion of Baha'u'llah at Bahji for the information of the general  public.    In closing the Guardian wishes me to renew to you the expressions of his  abiding and genuine appreciation of your labours for the Cause in  Auckland, and particularly in connection with your duties as secretary of  the local assembly. He is praying from the very depths of his heart for  your progress and success in this important field of Baha'i service.    With heartiest greetings to you and all the friends.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dearly beloved co-worker:_    _I wish to assure you of my deepest appreciation of your constant and  manifold services to the Faith, and particularly of the share you have had  in consolidating its administrative institutions in both Australia and New  Zealand, whether local or national.

(46) April 26th, 1936      Beloved Baha'i Sister,    I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letter of the 30th  March informing him of the date of Miss Kitty Carpenter's arrival in  Port-Said. You can be sure that the friends will be most delighted to meet  her, and to render her journey to Haifa as safe and comfortable as  possible.    The Guardian himself is eagerly looking forward to the pleasure of meeting  her, and cherishes the hope that through this pilgrimage she may receive a  renewed stimulus to better work for the promotion of the Faith upon her  return home....
