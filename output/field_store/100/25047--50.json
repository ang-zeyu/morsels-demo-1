Romantic composers are those who have  sought their ideals in other regions and striven to give expression to  them irrespective of the restrictions and limitations of form and the  conventions of law--composers with whom, in brief, content outweighs  manner. This definition presents Classicism as the regulative and  conservative principle in the history of the art, and Romanticism as  the progressive, regenerative, and creative principle. It is easy to  see how the notion of contest between them grew up, and the only harm  which can come from such a notion will ensue only if we shut our eyes  to the fact that it is a contest between two elements whose very  opposition stimulates life, and whose union, perfect, peaceful,  mutually supplemental, is found in every really great art-work. No law  which fixes, and hence limits, form, can remain valid forever. Its end  is served when it enforces itself long enough to keep lawlessness in  check till the test of time has determined what is sound, sweet, and  wholesome in the innovations which are always crowding eagerly into  every creative activity in art and science. In art it is ever true, as  _Faust_ concludes, that \"In the beginning was the deed.\" The laws of  composition are the products of compositions; and, being such, they  cannot remain unalterable so long as the impulse freshly to create  remains. All great men are ahead of their time, and in all great  music, no matter when written, you shall find instances of profounder  meaning and deeper or newer feeling than marked the generality of  contemporary compositions. So Bach frequently floods his formal  utterances with Romantic feeling, and the face of Beethoven, serving  at the altar in the temple of Beauty, is transfigured for us by divine  light. The principles of creation and conservation move onward  together, and what is Romantic to-day becomes Classic to-morrow.  Romanticism is fluid Classicism. It is the emotional stimulus  informing Romanticism which calls music into life, but no sooner is it  born, free, untrammelled, nature's child, than the regulative  principle places shackles upon it; but it is enslaved only that it may  become and remain art.

IV    _The Modern Orchestra_      [Sidenote: _The orchestra as an instrument._]    [Sidenote: _What may be heard from a band._]    The most eloquent, potent, and capable instrument of music in the  world is the modern orchestra. It is the instrument whose employment  by the classical composers and the geniuses of the Romantic School in  the middle of our century marks the high tide of the musical art. It  is an instrument, moreover, which is never played upon without giving  a great object-lesson in musical analysis, without inviting the eye to  help the ear to discern the cause of the sounds which ravish our  senses and stir up pleasurable emotions. Yet the popular knowledge of  its constituent parts, of the individual value and mission of the  factors which go to make up its sum, is scarcely greater than the  popular knowledge of the structure of a symphony or sonata. All this  is the more deplorable since at least a rudimentary knowledge of these  things might easily be gained, and in gaining it the student would  find a unique intellectual enjoyment, and have his ears unconsciously  opened to a thousand beauties in the music never perceived before. He  would learn, for instance, to distinguish the characteristic timbre of  each of the instruments in the band; and after that to the delight  found in what may be called the primary colors he would add that which  comes from analyzing the vast number of tints which are the products  of combination. Noting the capacity of the various instruments and the  manner in which they are employed, he would get glimpses into the  mental workshop of the composer. He would discover that there are  conventional means of expression in his art analogous to those in the  other arts; and collating his methods with the effects produced, he  would learn something of the creative artist's purposes. He would find  that while his merely sensuous enjoyment would be left unimpaired, and  the emotional excitement which is a legitimate fruit of musical  performance unchecked, these pleasures would have others consorted  with them. His intellectual faculties would be agreeably excited, and  he would enjoy the pleasures of memory, which are exemplified in music  more delightfully and more frequently than in any other art, because  of the role which repetition of parts plays in musical composition.    [Sidenote: _Familiar instruments._]    [Sidenote: _The instrumental choirs._]    The argument is as valid in the study of musical forms as in the study  of the orchestra, but it is the latter that is our particular business  in this chapter. Everybody listening to an orchestral concert  recognizes the physical forms of the violins, flutes, cornets, and big  drum; but even of these familiar instruments the voices are not always  recognized. As for the rest of the harmonious fraternity, few give  heed to them, even while enjoying the music which they produce; yet  with a few words of direction anybody can study the instruments of the  band at an orchestral concert. Let him first recognize the fact that  to the mind of a composer an orchestra always presents itself as a  combination of four groups of instruments--choirs, let us call them,  with unwilling apology to the lexicographers. These choirs are: first,  the viols of four sorts--violins, violas, violoncellos, and  double-basses, spoken of collectively as the \"string quartet;\" second,  the wind instruments of wood (the \"wood-winds\" in the musician's  jargon)--flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons; third, the wind  instruments of brass (the \"brass\")--trumpets, horns, trombones, and  bass tuba. In all of these subdivisions there are numerous variations  which need not detain us now. A further subdivision might be made in  each with reference to the harmony voices (showing an analogy with the  four voices of a vocal choir--soprano, contralto, tenor, and bass);  but to go into this might make the exposition confusing. The fourth  \"choir\" (here the apology to the lexicographers must be repeated with  much humility and earnestness) consists of the instruments of  percussion--the kettle-drums, big drum, cymbals, triangle, bell chime,  etc. (sometimes spoken of collectively in the United States as \"the  battery\").    [Illustration: SEATING PLAN OF THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.]    [Sidenote: _How orchestras are seated._]    [Sidenote: _Plan of the New York Philharmonic._]    The disposition of these instruments in our orchestras is largely a  matter of individual taste and judgment in the conductor, though the  general rule is exemplified in the plan given herewith, showing how  Mr. Anton Seidl has arranged the desks for the concerts of the  Philharmonic Society of New York. Mr. Theodore Thomas's arrangement  differed very little from that of Mr. Seidl, the most noticeable  difference being that he placed the viola-players beside the second  violinists, where Mr. Seidl has the violoncellists. Mr. Seidl's  purpose in making the change was to gain an increase in sonority for  the viola part, the position to the right of the stage (the left of  the audience) enabling the viola-players to hold their instruments  with the F-holes toward the listeners instead of away from them. The  relative positions of the harmonious battalions, as a rule, are as  shown in the diagram. In the foreground, the violins, violas, and  'cellos; in the middle distance, the wood-winds; in the background,  the brass and the battery; the double-basses flanking the whole body.  This distribution of forces is dictated by considerations of sonority,  the most assertive instruments--the brass and drums--being placed  farthest from the hearers, and the instruments of the viol tribe,  which are the real backbone of the band and make their effect by a  massing of voices in each part, having the place of honor and greatest  advantage. Of course it is understood that I am speaking of a concert  orchestra. In the case of theatrical or operatic bands the arrangement  of the forces is dependent largely upon the exigencies of space.    [Sidenote: _Solo instruments._]    Outside the strings the instruments are treated by composers as solo  instruments, a single flute, oboe, clarinet, or other wind instrument  sometimes doing the same work in the development of the composition as  the entire body of first violins. As a rule, the wood-winds are used  in pairs, the purpose of this being either to fill the harmony when  what I may call the principal thought of the composition is consigned  to a particular choir, or to strengthen a voice by permitting two  instruments to play in unison.    [Sidenote: _Groupings for harmony effects._]    [Sidenote: _Wagner's instrumental characterization._]    [Sidenote: _An instrumental language._]    Each choir, except the percussion instruments, is capable of playing  in full harmony; and this effect is frequently used by composers.

This picture, the _Embarquement de Cythere_, is the wonder of wonders of  this master.        _L'Art du Dix-huitieme Siecle_ (3d ed., Paris, 1880).          THE SISTINE MADONNA    (_RAPHAEL_)    F.A. GRUYER      Raphael seemed to have attained perfection in the _Virgin with the  Fish_; however, four or five years later, he was to rise infinitely  higher and display something superior to art and inaccessible to  science.    It was in 1518 that the Benedictines of the monastery of St. Sixtus  ordered this picture. They had required that the Virgin and the Infant  Jesus should be in the company of St. Sixtus and St. Barbara. This is  how Raphael entered into their views.    Deep shadows were veiling from us the majesty of the skies. Suddenly  light succeeds the obscurity, and the Infant Jesus and Mary appear  surrounded by a brightness so intense that the eyes can scarcely bear  it. Between two green curtains drawn to either side of the picture, amid  an aureole of innumerable cherubin, the Virgin is seen standing upon the  clouds, with her son in her arms, showing him to the world as its  Redeemer and Sovereign Judge. Lower down, St. Sixtus and St. Barbara are  kneeling on the clouds on either side. Nothing is visible of the earth,  but it is divined by the gestures and glances of the two saints, who are  pointing to the multitude for whom they are imploring the divine mercy.  Two angels are leaning on a kind of balustrade whose horizontal line  forms a solid plane at the base of the composition. Nothing could be  more elementary than the idea of such a picture; the ancient symmetry  and the most rigid parallelism are scrupulously observed. Raphael  becomes almost archaic, and, while returning to the simplicity of  primitive traditions, by the force of genius he confounds the scientific  exaggeration that is already so close to decadence. Doubtless he had  raised his eyes high every time he had taken antiquity as a model, but  he raised them much higher still by becoming exclusively Christian  again, and by comprehending that the humblest way is not only the  surest, but also the most sublime. Why is such simple means so highly  successful in exalting our feelings? Why is it, when looking at this  picture, we have moments of divine oblivion in which we fancy ourselves  in Heaven? That is what we must try to penetrate and comprehend.    [Illustration: THE SISTINE MADONNA.          _Raphael_.]    The principal figure of the picture is the Infant Jesus. He is no longer  the graceful _Bambino_ that we have so often seen in the arms of  Raphael's Madonnas, gentle and encouraging to the eyes of mankind, or  again he who, erewhile, in the _Virgin with the Fish_, leaned towards  the young Tobit; it is the God himself, it is the God of Justice and of  the Last Day. In the most humble state of our flesh, beneath the veil of  infancy, we see the terrifying splendour of infinite majesty in this  picture. The divine Infant leaves between himself and us a place for  fear, and in his presence we experience something of the fear of God  that Adam felt and that he transmitted to his race. For attaining such  heights of impression the means employed by Raphael are of an  incomprehensible simplicity. The Infant Jesus nestles familiarly in his  mother's arms. Sitting on a fold of the white veil that the Virgin  supports with her left hand, he leans against the Madonna's right arm;  his legs are crossed one above the other; the whole of the left arm  follows the bend of the body and the left hand rests upon the right leg;  at the same time, the right shoulder being raised by Mary's hand, the  right arm is bent at the elbow and the hand grasps the Virgin's veil.  This attitude, so natural, so true, so unstudied, expresses grandeur and  sovereignty. Nothing can be more elementary nor more powerful. The light  rests calmly upon every part of this beautiful body and all its members  in such fine repose. Humanity was never seen under such radiance. The  Son of God, in transporting to Heaven the terrestrial form of his  infancy, has made it divine for all eternity. Raphael doubtless owed to  antiquity something of the power that enabled him spontaneously to  create such a masterpiece; but in this case he has far surpassed his  models, and we should search vainly in antique art for a more ideal and  grand figure than that of this marvellous infant. However, hitherto we  have only examined the body, what shall we say about the head to give a  true idea of it? In fact, that is perhaps the most extraordinary and  most indescribable part of the whole picture. The Infant Jesus seems to  recoil from the spectacle of human shame; he lovingly presses against  the Virgin's breast, softly rests his forehead against his Mother's  cheek, and darts towards the world one of those flaming and terrible  glances at which, it is said, everything in heaven, on earth, and in  hell trembles. His disordered hair stands upright and quivers as in the  breath of the tempest, and sombre clouds pass across the widely modelled  forehead; the brows are frowning, the pupils dilate and the flame is  ready to dart forth; the eyes, profound and terrible, are preparing to  flash with lightning; they still withhold it, but we feel that it may  break forth, and we tremble. This glance is truly splendid; it  fascinates you, attracts you, and, at the same time, fills you with  terror. The lips are quivering, and, from the point of view of line,  that is the great mystery, I think; the upper lip, visibly lifted on the  left side, assumes a strange accent of anger and indignation. This  deviation of a single feature is materially a small matter, and yet it  suffices to stamp the whole countenance with irresistible action. The  Infant Jesus assumes a formidable aspect; we recognize in him the  Sovereign Judge; his power is infinite and one act of his will be  sufficient to condemn or absolve. The _Virgin of the Chair_ had given us  a presentiment of this image in 1516; the _Virgin of St. Sixtus_ shows  it to us in 1518, in its eternal grandeur and sublime reality. But the  Word of God would scarcely leave room for anything but fear, if the  Virgin did not immediately come to shed hope in the soul terrified at  the idea of justice.    In fact, the Virgin remains calm and serene beside her enraged son, and  reassures our heart also with her confidence. If she presents the Son of  God to the world under a terrifying aspect, at the same time she presses  him so tenderly against her breast, and her features, under the  splendour of the divine radiance, shine with such purity that we feel  the flame that purifies all passing within ourselves. The Virgin  appears here like the dawning light. She advances from right to left,  beautiful as the skies, light as the cloud that bears her. Her gait, or  rather her flight through the air, is stamped with royal nobleness and  dignity. Her right hand, raised as high as the shoulder, holds the body  of Jesus under his right arm, and the Saviour lies back against his  Mother's right arm, while Mary's left arm is placed under the Infant's  body to support and carry him. The Virgin of St. Sixtus, like every  Madonna, wears a red robe and a white mantle; and Art has never done  greater things with drapery with such simple elements. The mantle falls  with a beautiful movement over the lower part of the body and floats in  wide folds, which, while sharply defining the form and movement of the  lower limbs, reveals the bare feet which are of admirable form and  colour. The robe, ornamented only with a little gold embroidery on the  sleeve, is of a purple tint in the shadows and becomes rose in the  light; it is girdled below the breast like the antique statues, and  reveals the neck as well as the top of the shoulders, which are  surrounded by a veil of white gauze. A long scarf of the same colour as  the veil but tinted with bistre, is placed on the crown of the head,  and, distending like a sail above the left shoulder, returns to the left  hand to serve as a support for the Infant, and runs along the body of  Jesus, who grasps it with his right hand. The Virgin's head appears in  full illumination without any artifice, and glows solely with its own  beauty. It is three quarters left, indeed almost full face, in a similar  position but in opposition to the Saviour's head, which, as we have  seen, is three quarters right and almost full face also. The hair, a  light chestnut, is arranged simply in smooth and flat bands lightly  waved above the brow, leaving the ears, cheeks, and temples completely  uncovered, and not interfering in any way with the outlines of the face.  The forehead, of a medium height, presents a widely developed surface,  in the centre of which glows a light that is continued down the bridge  of the nose. The eyes, of irreproachable shape, are full of brilliance,  and their gaze sheds over all it illumines an infinite softness mingled  with an indefinable exaltation. The mouth trembles with divine emotion  and seems to quiver with celestial bliss.    Another remarkable thing in this supreme manifestation of genius is that  in the Virgin and the Infant, of such different, we might almost say  such opposite expressions, the same features are noticeably repeated.  Raphael has been faithful to the last to the system he adopted in almost  his earliest pictures, and to make this intentional resemblance more  noticeable here he has placed the two heads close together, and shown  them almost full face, so that there shall be no distracting element;  and has opposed them to each other by turning them in different ways so  that they may complement each other and be reflected in one another as  in a mirror. Therefore, as the same glory surrounds both Mother and Son  at the same time, so the same character of beauty is found faithfully  reproduced in each. The skulls of"]]]
