(#9)"],[1,"founded  on an assertion that he had thrown away the best advantages in the  treaty of peace. He was joined in his opposition by the old Duke of  Newcastle, whose halls again became the resort of politicians. Meetings  were held at his residence, in which nobles and commons alike concerted  together the means of making the peace unpopular, and bringing Bute into  still greater contempt with the public. Pens, dipped in gall, were set  to work to demonstrate to the people that Martinique, Guadaloupe, St.  Lucie, Pondicherry, and the Havannah ought to have been retained in the  treaty of Fontainebleau; that compensation in money ought to have been  obtained from both France and Spain; that, by demolishing the forts  in Honduras, English subjects were deprived of the log-wood trade, and  subjected to the jealous rage of the Spaniards; and that an opportunity  of humbling the house of Bourbon had been completely thrown away. In  maintaining these propositions, dark insinuations were thrown out,  reflecting upon the characters of Bute, the king's mother, and the Duke  of Bedford. They had all, it was said, touched French gold. Epigrams,  scandals, and stories, also, concerning Bute and the princess dowager,  rang from one end of the country to the other. And the conduct of the  princess and Bute seemed to justify the scandal, although it does not  appear to have rested on sure grounds. Thus they precluded, as much as  possible, all access to the king, except to Bute's relatives connexions,  and dependents; and when Bute visited the princess it was generally  in the evening, and then in a sedan-chair belonging to a lady of the  household of the princess, and with close-drawn curtains. His enemies  did not fail to take advantage of his imprudent conduct, and they soon  succeeded in making him the most unpopular man in the three kingdoms.  This soon became manifest to the royal favourite; for addresses on  occasion of this peace were refused by the counties of York and Surrey,  and they came in slowly and ill-supported from other quarters. Bute,  however, was too proud and unconciliating to make any attempt to set  himself right in public opinion, and he suffered his enemies to work on,  till his character became unredeemable, and his downfall was effected.    Still Bute might possibly have enjoyed his high station for some time  longer had there not existed at this time a necessity for an increase  of taxation, and for a loan of three millions and a half, to enable  government to pay debts contracted during the war. This necessity could  not be fairly imputed to Bute, but he was unfortunate in his plan of  raising the loan, and in his choice of new taxes. Instead of throwing  the loan open to competition, he disposed of the shares privately, and  they immediately rose to eleven per cent, premium; whence he was charged  with gratifying himself or his dependents with L350,000 at the public  expense. His new tax was produced in the shape of ten shillings duty  per hogshead on cider and perry, which was to be paid by the first  purchaser, while an additional duty of eight pounds per ton was proposed  to be laid on French wines, and half that sum on other wines. The tax  on cider raised such a storm of opposition from the country members  generally, without reference to party, that Bute was induced to alter  both the sum and the mode of levying it--four shillings per hogshead was  to be paid, and it was to be levied upon the grower, through the medium  of the exciseman. This was not an unreasonable tax, for ale and porter  were already taxed both directly and indirectly, and no argument could  show that while a liquor produced from malt contributed to the public  exigencies, a liquor produced from apples should be exempt. Englishmen,  however, were always averse to the visits of the excisemen; and the  city of London, the cities of Exeter and Worcester, and the counties of  Devonshire and Herefordshire, the interests of which were concerned  in the matter more nearly than the citizens of London, petitioned the  commons, the lords, and the throne, against the bill. A general threat  was made, that the apples should rot upon the ground rather than be made  into a beverage subject to such a duty and such annoyances. In the  house of commons, also, Pitt spoke long and eloquently against the bill;  inveighing bitterly against the intrusion of officers into the private  dwellings of Englishmen; quoting the well-known maxim that in England  \"every man's house is his castle.\" Stern opposition was, moreover, made  in the house of lords; and, had Bute been wise, he would have bowed  deferentially to the public feeling, and have adopted some other mode  of raising the money less repugnant to the temper and disposition of the  people. Bute, however, to use a figurative expression, proudly bared his  head to the tempest which was playing around him. He was determined  that the bill should pass, and he carried his point despite the fierce  opposition of the whole country. The bill passed into a law, and  although there were four different kinds of cider, varying in price from  five to fifty shillings per hogshead, they were all taxed alike.    Yet Bute was not made of such stern material that he could defy the  people with impunity. He had gained this victory over them, but he  evidently felt that their voice was omnipotent, and that if he longer  resisted it, he might possibly one day, and that soon, be doomed to  suffer disgrace by defeat. Under these circumstances, almost as soon  as the bill passed into a law, he surprised his friends and his enemies  alike, by suddenly tendering his resignation. Opinions varied as to his  motives for taking such a step. Some of his enemies said that he had  retired from the rising storm of national indignation, and that Pitt  had politically killed him; others that the king and queen, whose strict  morality of conduct was well known, had at length taken umbrage at his  intimacy with the queen dowager; while others asserted that he abandoned  his post from a consciousness of guilt, and a dread of impeachment for  certain acts not yet made known to the public. On the other hand,  his friends asserted that his retirement arose from his hatred of the  intrigues of a public life, and represented him as panting in the midst  of the toils of his office for literary and rural retirement. His own  reason, as expressed to a friend, was, that he found himself powerless  in his own cabinet. \"Single in a cabinet of my own forming,\" he  observed, \"no aid in the house of lords to support me, except two peers,  [Denbigh and Pomfret]; both the secretaries of state silent, and the  lord chief justice, whom I myself brought into office, voting for me,  yet speaking against me; the ground I tread upon is so hollow, that I am  afraid, not only of falling myself, but of involving my royal master in  my ruin. It is time for me to retire.\" Bute retired as proudly as he had  exercised his office, for he neither asked for pension nor sinecure, and  his retirement was followed by that of Sir Francis Dashwood, chancellor  of the exchequer, and of Fox, who were elevated to the peerage: the  former as Baron le Despencer, and the latter as Baron Holland. Mr.  George Grenville succeeded to the premiership, and also to the place  which had been occupied by Dashwood, uniting in himself the offices of  chancellor of the exchequer and first lord of the treasury. But Bute  still acted behind the scenes. He pulled the strings, and Grenville and  the rest of the cabinet answered his motions, as mechanically as though  they had been so many puppets. Grenville, indeed, seems to have been  chosen by the king and Bute, as a willing instrument for carrying their  plans into ready execution.          THE CHARACTER AND IMPEACHMENT OF WILKES.    One of the most sturdy opponents of Bute and his administration had been  the celebrated John Wilkes, member of parliament for Aylesbury, and a  lieutenant-colonel in the Buckinghamshire militia. On first entering  into office, Bute, by the advice of Bubb Doddington, had established a  newspaper, styled \"The Briton,\" the ostensible object of which was,  to advocate the measures of Bute's administration. Many writers were  employed to write for this paper; and while they exalted the premier,  they did not fail to vilify his opponents. To oppose this organ of the  ministers, another paper was set on foot, and conducted by Wilkes, under  the the title of \"The North Briton.\" Wilkes was a man of ruined fortune  and of dissolute habits; but he was active, enterprising, and daring,  and possessed a considerable fund of wit and repartee. In the beginning  of this reign, he had solicited a lucrative post under government,  but had been disappointed. His failure was attributed by him to the  influence which Bute held over the monarch, and he began to vent his  spleen against the minister and his coadjutors in scandalizing and  calumniating their actions and private characters. Both in conversation  and in the \"North Briton,\" they were ever made the butts of his ready  wit. He even reviled, stigmatized, and heaped curses upon Bute's country  and countrymen. According to his showing, the river Tweed was the line  of demarcation between all that was honourable and noble, and all that  was dishonourable and servile--south of that river, honour, virtue,  and patriotism flourished; north of it, malice, meanness, and slavery  prevailed. Every Scotchman was painted by him as a hungry beggar,  time-server, and traitor. Wilkes was, perhaps, not singular in his  antipathies at this time against the Scotch, for wiser men than him  exhibited them in their writings and in their conversation, arising in a  great measure from the circumstance of the introduction of large numbers  of them into the offices of government. But in this, Bute acted as any  other man would have done under similar circumstances, as every one  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19226"],[0,"The Dog's Book of Verse (#9)"],[1," on my brow.      I'm weaker, an' weaker, an' weaker; I fancy the end ain't fur,    But you know why here on my deathbed I think o' the Lord and her,    And he who, by men's hands tortured, uttered that prayer divine,    'Ull pardon me linkin' him like with a dawg as forgave like mine.

THE DOG OF THE LOUVRE        With gentle tread, with uncovered head,      Pass by the Louvre gate,    Where buried lie the \"men of July,\"    And flowers are hung by the passers-by,      And the dog howls desolate.      That dog had fought in the fierce onslaught,      Had rushed with his master on,    And both fought well;    But the master fell,      And behold the surviving one!      By his lifeless clay,    Shaggy and gray,      His fellow-warrior stood;    Nor moved beyond,    But mingled fond      Big tears with his master's blood.      Vigil he keeps    By those green heaps      That tell where heroes lie.    No passer-by    Can attract his eye,      For he knows it is not He!      At the dawn, when dew    Wets the garlands new      That are hung in this place of mourning,    He will start to meet    The coming feet      Of him whom he dreamt returning.      On the grave's wood-cross    When the chaplets toss,      By the blast of midnight shaken,    How he howleth! hark!    From that dwelling dark      The slain he would fain awaken.      When the snow comes fast    On the chilly blast,      Blanching the bleak church-yard,    With limbs outspread    On the dismal bed      Of his liege, he still keeps guard.      Oft in the night,    With main and might,      He strives to raise the stone;    Short respite takes:    \"If master wakes,      He'll call me,\" then sleeps on.      Of bayonet blades,    Of barricades,      And guns he dreams the most;    Starts from his dream,    And then would seem      To eye a pleading ghost.      He'll linger there    In sad despair      And die on his master's grave.    His home?--'tis known    To the dead alone,--      He's the dog of the nameless brave!      Give a tear to the dead,    And give some bread      To the dog of the Louvre gate!    Where buried lie the men of July,    And flowers are hung by the passers-by,      And the dog howls desolate.        RALPH CECIL.            THE CHASE        Huntsman, take heed; they stop in full career.    Yon crowding flock, that at a distance gaze,    Have haply foil'd the turf. See that old hound!    How busily he works, but dares not trust    His doubtful sense; draws yet a wider ring.    Hark! Now again the chorus fills. As bells,    Sally'd awhile, at once their paean renew,    And high in air the tuneful thunder rolls,    See how they toss, with animated rage    Recovering all they lost! That eager haste    Some doubling wile foreshows. Ah! Yet once more      They're checked, hold back with speed--on either hand    They flourish round--e'en yet persist--'tis right.    Away they spring. The rustling stubbles bend    Beneath the driving storm. Now the poor chase    Begins to flag, to her last shifts reduced.    From brake to brake she flies, and visits all    Her well-known haunts, where once she ranged secure,    With love and plenty blest. See! There she goes,    She reels along, and by her gait betrays    Her inward weakness. See how black she looks!    The sweat, that clogs the obstructed pores, scarce leaves    A languid scent. And now in open view    See! See! She flies! Each eager hound exerts    His utmost speed, and stretches every nerve;    How quick she turns! Their gaping jaws eludes,    And yet a moment lives--till, round enclosed    By all the greedy pack, with infant screams    She yields her breath, and there, reluctant, dies.        LORD SOMERVILLE.            THE UNDER DOG        I know that the world, the great big world,      Will never a moment stop    To see which dog may be in the fault,      But will shout for the dog on top.    But for me, I shall never pause to ask      Which dog may be in the right,    For my heart will beat, while it beats at all,      For the under dog in the fight.        ANONYMOUS.            THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG        My dog and I are both grown old;      On these wild downs we watch all day;    He looks in my face when the wind blows cold,      And thus methinks I hear him say:      The gray stone circlet is below,      The village smoke is at our feet;    We nothing hear but the sailing crow,      And wandering flocks that roam and bleat.      Far off, the early horseman hies,      In shower or sunshine rushing on;    Yonder the dusty whirlwind flies;      The distant coach is seen and gone.      Though solitude around is spread,      Master, alone thou shalt not be;    And when the turf is on thy head,      I only shall remember thee.      I marked his look of faithful care,      I placed my hand on his shaggy side;    \"There is a sun that shines above,      A sun that shines on both,\" I cried.        WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES.            BETH GELERT        The spearman heard the bugle sound,      And cheerily smiled the morn;    And many a brach, and many a hound,      Attend Llewellyn's horn:      And still he blew a louder blast,      And gave a louder cheer:    \"Come, Gelert! Why art thou the last      Llewellyn's horn to hear?      \"Oh, where does faithful Gelert roam?      The flower of all his race!    So true, so brave, a lamb at home,      A lion in the chase!\"      In sooth, he was a peerless hound,      The gift of royal John,    But now no Gelert could be found,      And all the chase rode on.      And now, as over rocks and dells,      The gallant chidings rise,    All Snowdon's craggy chaos yells      With many mingled cries.      That day Llewellyn little loved      The chase of hart or hare,    And small and scant the booty proved,      For Gelert was not there.      Unpleased, Llewellyn homeward hied,      When near the portal-seat,    His truant Gelert he espied,      Bounding his lord to meet.      But when he gained the castle door,      Aghast the chieftain stood;    The hound was smeared with gouts of gore,      His lips and fangs ran blood.      Llewellyn gazed with wild surprise,      Unused such looks to meet;    His favorite checked his joyful guise,      And crouched and licked his feet.      Onward in haste Llewellyn passed,      And on went Gelert, too,    And still, where'er his eyes were cast,      Fresh blood-gouts shocked his view.      O'erturned his infant's bed he found,      The blood-stained covert rent;    And all around, the walls and ground,      With recent blood besprent.      He called the child--no voice replied;      He searched, with terror wild;    Blood! Blood! He found on every side,      But nowhere found the child!      \"Hell-hound! By thee my child's devoured!\"      The frantic father cried;    And to the hilt his vengeful sword      He plunged in Gelert's side.      His suppliant, as to earth he fell,      No pity could impart,    But still his Gelert's dying yell      Passed heavy o'er his heart.      Aroused by Gelert's dying yell,      Some slumberer wakened nigh;    What words the parent's joy can tell      To hear his infant cry!      Concealed beneath a mangled heap      His hurried search had missed,    All glowing from his rosy sleep,      His cherub-boy he kissed.      Nor scratch had he, nor harm, nor dread,      But, the same couch beneath,    Lay a great wolf, all torn and dead--      Tremendous still in death.      Ah! What was then Llewellyn's pain!      For now the truth was clear:    The gallant hound the wolf had slain      To save Llewellyn's heir.      Vain, vain was all Llewellyn's woe;      \"Best of thy kind, adieu!    The frantic deed which laid thee low      This heart shall ever rue!\"      And now a gallant tomb they raise,      With costly sculpture decked,    And marbles, storied with his praise,      Poor Gelert's bones protect.      Here never could the spearman pass,      Or forester, unmoved!    Here oft the tear-besprinkled grass      Llewellyn's sorrow proved.      And here he hung his horn and spear,      And oft, as evening fell,    In fancy's piercing sounds would hear      Poor Gelert's dying yell.        WILLIAM ROBERT SPENCER.

Ah, Muggsie, good and faithful dog,              Gone to your rest!    You served your country and your flag              The very best    That lay within your humble power,              And in that far    Have been much better than some men              And women are.    As you had lived, good dog, you died,              And it is meet    The flag you served your best should be              Your winding sheet.        WILLIAM J. LAMPTON.            A GUARDIAN AT THE GATE        The dog beside the threshold lies,    Mocking sleep with half-shut eyes--    With head crouched down upon his feet,    Till strangers pass his sunny seat--    Then quick he pricks his ears to hark    And bustles up to growl and bark;    While boys in fear stop short their song,    And sneak in startled speed along;    And beggar, creeping like a snail,    To make his hungry hopes prevail    O'er the warm heart of charity,    Leaves his lame halt and hastens by.
