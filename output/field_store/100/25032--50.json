They drew  their inspirations from the books of magic written by Thot, which  taught them the art of interpreting dreams or of curing the sick, or  of invoking and obliging the gods to assist them, and of arresting  or hastening the progress of the sun on the celestial ocean. Some are  mentioned as being able to divide the waters at their will, and to  cause them to return to their natural place, merely by means of a short  formula. An image of a man or animal made by them out of enchanted  wax, was imbued with life at their command, and became an irresistible  instrument of their wrath. Popular stories reveal them to us at work.  \"Is it true,\" said Kheops to one of them, \"that thou canst replace a  head which has been cut off?\" On his admitting that he could do so,  Pharaoh immediately desired to test his power. \"Bring me a prisoner from  prison and let him be slain.\" The magician, at this proposal, exclaimed:  \"Nay, nay, not a man, sire my master; do not command that this sin  should be committed; a fine animal will suffice!\" A goose was brought,  \"its head was cut off and the body was placed on the right side, and  the head of the goose on the left side of the hall: he recited what he  recited from his book of magic, the goose began to hop forward, the head  moved on to it, and, when both were united, the goose began to cackle.  A pelican was produced, and underwent the same process. His Majesty then  caused a bull to be brought forward, and its head was smitten to the  ground: the magician recited what he recited from his book of magic,  the bull at once arose, and he replaced on it what had fallen to the  earth.\" The great lords themselves deigned to become initiated into  the occult sciences, and were invested with these formidable powers.  A prince who practised magic would enjoy amongst us nowadays but small  esteem: in Egypt sorcery was not considered incompatible with royalty,  and the magicians of Pharaoh often took Pharaoh himself as their pupil.*    Such were the king's household, the people about his person, and those  attached to the service of his family. His capital sheltered a still  greater number of officials and functionaries who were charged with  the administration of his fortune--that is to say, what he possessed  in Egypt.** In theory it was always supposed that the whole of the  soil belonged to him, but that he and his predecessors had diverted and  parcelled off such an amount of it for the benefit of their favourites,  or for the hereditary lords, that only half of the actual territory  remained under his immediate control. He governed most of the nomes of  the Delta in person:*** beyond the Fayum, he merely retained isolated  lands, enclosed in the middle of feudal principalities and often at  considerable distance from each other.         * We know the reputation, extending even to the classical       writers of antiquity, of the Pharaohs Nechepso and Nectanebo       for their skill in magic. Arab writers have, moreover,       collected a number of traditions concerning the marvels       which the sorcerers of Egypt were in the habit of       performing; as an instance, I may quote the description       given by Makrizi of one of their meetings, which is probably       taken from some earlier writer.         ** They were frequently distinguished from their provincial       or manorial colleagues by the addition of the word _khonu_       to their titles, a term which indicates, in a general       manner, the royal residence. They formed what we should       nowadays call the departmental staff of the public officers,       and might be deputed to act, at least temporarily, in the       provinces, or in the service of one of the feudal princes,       without thereby losing their status as functionaries of the       _khonu_ or central administration.         *** This seems, at any rate, an obvious inference from the       almost total absence of feudal titles on the most ancient       monuments of the Delta. Erman, who was struck by this fact,       attributed it to a different degree of civilization in the       two halves of Egypt; I attribute it to a difference in       government. Feudal titles naturally predominate in the       South, royal administrative titles in the North.    The extent of the royal domain varied with different dynasties, and even  from reign to reign: if it sometimes decreased, owing to too frequently  repeated concessions,* its losses were generally amply compensated by  the confiscation of certain fiefs, or by their lapsing to the crown. The  domain was always of sufficient extent to oblige the Pharaoh to confide  the larger portion of it to officials of various kinds, and to farm  merely a small remainder of the \"royal slaves:\" in the latter case,  he reserved for himself all the profits, but at the expense of all the  annoyance and all the outlay; in the former case, he obtained without  any risk the annual dues, the amount of which was fixed on the spot,  according to the resources of the nome.         * We find, at different periods, persons who call themselves       masters of new domains or strongholds--Pahurnofir, under the       IIIrd dynasty; several princes of Hermopolis, under the VIth       and VIIth; Khnumhotpu at the begining of the XIIth. In       connection with the last named, we shall have occasion,       later on, to show in what manner and with what rapidity one       of these great _new_ fiefs was formed.    In order to understand the manner in which the government of Egypt was  conducted, we should never forget that the world was still ignorant of  the use of money, and that gold, silver, and copper, however abundant we  may suppose them to have been, were mere articles of exchange, like  the most common products of Egyptian soil. Pharaoh was not then, as the  State is with us, a treasurer who calculates the total of his receipts  and expenses in ready money, banks his revenue in specie occupying but  little space, and settles his accounts from the same source. His fiscal  receipts were in kind, and it was in kind that he remunerated his  servants for their labour: cattle, cereals, fermented drinks, oils,  stuffs, common or precious metals,--\"all that the heavens give, all  that the earth produces, all that the Nile brings from its mysterious  sources,\"* --constituted the coinage in which his subjects paid him their  contributions, and which he passed on to his vassals by way of salary.         * This was the most usual formula for the offering on the       funerary stelo, and sums up more completely than any other       the nature of the tax paid to the gods by the living, and       consequently the nature of that paid to the king; here, as       elsewhere, the domain of the gods is modelled on that of the       Pharaohs.    One room, a few feet square, and, if need be, one safe, would easily  contain the entire revenue of one of our modern empires: the largest  of our emporiums would not always have sufficed to hold the mass of  incongruous objects which represented the returns of a single Egyptian  province. As the products in which the tax was paid took various forms,  it was necessary to have an infinite variety of special agents and  suitable places to receive it; herdsmen and sheds for the oxen,  measurers and granaries for the grain, butlers and cellarers for  the wine, beer, and oils. The product of the tax, while awaiting  redistribution, could only be kept from deteriorating in value by  incessant labour, in which a score of different classes of clerks and  workmen in the service of the treasury all took part, according to their  trades. If the tax were received in oxen, it was led to pasturage, or at  times, when a murrain threatened to destroy it, to the slaughter-house  and the currier; if it were in corn, it was bolted, ground to flour, and  made into bread and pastry; if it were in stuffs, it was washed, ironed,  and folded, to be retailed as garments or in the piece. The royal  treasury partook of the character of the farm, the warehouse, and the  manufactory.    Each of the departments which helped to swell its contents, occupied  within the palace enclosure a building, or group of buildings, which was  called its \"house,\" or, as we should say, its storehouse.    [Illustration: 059.jpg THE PACKING OF THE LINEN AND ITS REMOVAL TO THE  WHITE STOREHOUSE.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a chromolithograph in Lepsius,       _Denhm._, ii. 96.    There was the \"White Storehouse,\" where the stuffs and jewels were  kept, and at times the wine; the \"Storehouse of the Oxen,\" the \"Gold  Storehouse,\" the \"Storehouse for Preserved Fruits,\" the \"Storehouse for  Grain,\" the \"Storehouse for Liquors,\" and ten other storehouses of the  application of which we are not always sure. In the \"Storehouse of  Weapons\" (or Armoury) were ranged thousands of clubs, maces, pikes,  daggers, bows, and bundles of arrows, which Pharaoh distributed to his  recruits whenever a war forced him to call out his army, and which were  again warehoused after the campaign. The \"storehouses\" were further  subdivided into rooms or store-chambers,* each reserved for its own  category of objects.         * Ait, Ai. Lefebure has collected a number of passages in       which these storehouses are mentioned, in his notes _Sur       differents mots et noms Egyptiens._ In many of the cases       which he quotes, and in which he recognizes an office of the       State, I believe reference to be made to a trade: many of       the ari ait-afu, \"people of the store-chambers for meat,\"       were probably butchers; many of the ari ait-hiqItu, \"people       of the store-chamber for beer,\" were probably keepers of       drink-shops, trading on their own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#9)"],[1," it amulets of sovereign virtue against evil spells.    [Illustration: 051.jpg THE JUDI MOUNTAINS SOMETIMES IDENTIFIED WITH TUB  NTSIB MOUNTAINS.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by G. Smith, _Assyrian       Discoveries_, p. 108.         * We are ignorant of the object which the goddess lifted up:       it may have been the sceptre surmounted by a radiating star,       such as we see on certain cylinders. Several Assyriologists       translate it arrows or lightning. Ishtar is, in fact, an       armed goddess who throws the arrow or lightning made by her       father Anu, the heaven.         ** Bekossus, fragm. xv. The legend about the remains of the       ark has passed into Jewish tradition concerning the Deluge.       Nicholas of Damascus relates, like Berossus, that they were       still to be seen on the top of Mount Baris. From that time       they have been continuously seen, sometimes on one peak and       sometimes on another. In the last century they were pointed       out to Chardin, and the memory of them has not died out in       our own century. Discoveries of charcoal and bitumen, such       as those made at Gebel Judi, upon one of the mountains       identified with Nisir, probably explain many of these local       traditions.    The chronicle of these fabulous times placed, soon after the abating of  the waters, the foundation of a new dynasty, as extraordinary or almost  as extraordinary in character as that before the flood. According to  Berossus it was of Chaldaean origin, and comprised eighty-six kings, who  bore rule during 34,080 years; the first two, Evechous and Khomasbelos,  reigned 2400 and 2700 years, while the later reigns did not exceed  the ordinary limits of human life. An attempt was afterwards made to  harmonize them with probability: the number of kings was reduced to  six, and their combined reigns to 225 years. This attempt arose from  a misapprehension of their true character; names and deeds, everything  connected with them belongs to myth and fiction only, and is irreducible  to history proper. They supplied to priests and poets material for  scores of different stories, of which several have come down to us in  fragments. Some are short, and serve as preambles to prayers or magical  formulas; others are of some length, and may pass for real epics. The  gods intervene in them, and along with kings play an important part. It  is Nera, for instance, the lord of the plague, who declares war against  mankind in order to punish them for having despised the authority of  Anu. He makes Babylon to feel his wrath first: \"The children of Babel,  they were as birds, and the bird-catcher, thou wert he! thou takest them  in the net, thou enclosest them, thou decimatest them--hero Nera!\"  One after the other he attacks the mother cities of the Euphrates and  obliges them to render homage to him--even Uruk, \"the dwelling of Anu  and Ishtar--the town of the priestesses, of the _almehs_, and the sacred  courtesans; \"then he turns upon the foreign nations and carries his  ravages as far as Phoenicia. In other fragments, the hero Etana makes an  attempt to raise himself to heaven, and the eagle, his companion, flies  away with him, without, however, being able to bring the enterprise to  a successful issue. Nimrod and his exploits are known to us from the  Bible.* \"He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said,  Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of  his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of  Shinar.\" Almost all the characteristics which are attributed by Hebrew  tradition to Nimrod we find in G-ilgames, King of Uruk and descendant of  the Shamashnapishtim who had witnessed the deluge.**         * Genesis x. 9, 10. Among the Jews and Mussulmans a complete       cycle of legends have developed around Nimrod. He built the       Tower of Babel; he threw Abraham into a fiery furnace, and       he tried to mount to heaven on the back of an eagle. Sayce       and Grivel saw in Nimrod an heroic form of Merodach, the god       of Babylonia: the majority of living Assyriologists prefer       to follow Smith's example, and identify him with the hero       Gilgames.         ** The name of this hero is composed of three signs, which       Smith provisionally rendered Isdubar--a reading which,       modified into Gishdhubar, Gistubar, is still retained by       many Assyriologists. There have been proposed one after       another the renderings Dhubar, Namrudu, Anamarutu, Numarad,       Namrasit, all of which exhibit in the name of the hero that       of Nimrod. Pinches discovered, in 1890, what appears to be       the true signification of the three signs,Gilgamesh,       Gilgames; Sayce and Oppert have compared this name with that       of Gilgamos, a Babylonian hero, of whom. AElian has preserved       the memory. A. Jeremias continued to reject both the reading       and the identification.    Several copies of a poem, in which an unknown scribe had celebrated his  exploits, existed about the middle of the VIIth century before our era  in the Royal Library at Nineveh; they had been transcribed by order of  Assur-banipal from a more ancient copy, and the fragments of them which  have come down to us, in spite of their lacunae, enable us to restore  the original text, if not in its entirety, at least in regard to  the succession of events. They were divided into twelve episodes  corresponding with the twelve divisions of the year, and the ancient  Babylonian author was guided in his choice of these divisions by  something more than mere chance. Gilgames, at first an ordinary mortal  under the patronage of the gods, had himself become a god and son of the  goddess Aruru: \"he had seen the abyss, he had learned everything that  is kept secret and hidden, he had even made known to men what had taken  place before the deluge.\" The sun, who had protected him in his human  condition, had placed him beside himself on the judgment-seat, and  delegated to him authority to pronounce decisions from which there was  no appeal: he was, as it were, a sun on a small scale, before whom the  kings, princes, and great ones of the earth humbly bowed their heads.*  The scribes had, therefore, some authority for treating the events of  his life after the model of the year, and for expressing them in twelve  chants, which answered to the annual course of the sun through the  twelve months.         * The identity of Gilgames with the Accadian fire-god, or       rather with the sun, was recognized from the first by H.       Rawlinson, and has been accepted since by almost all       Assyriologists. A tablet brought back by G. Smith, called       attention to by Fr. Delitzsch, and published by Haupt,       contains the remains of a hymn addressed to Gilgames, \"the       powerful king, the king of the Spirits of the Earth.\"    [Illustration: 057.jpg GILGAMES STRANGLES A LION.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an Assyrian bas-relief from       Khorsabad, in the Museum of the Louvre    The whole story is essentially an account of his struggles with Ishtar,  and the first pages reveal him as already at issue with the goddess. His  portrait, such as the monuments have preserved it for us, is singularly  unlike the ordinary type: one would be inclined to regard it as  representing an individual of a different race, a survival of some very  ancient nation which had held rule on the plains of the Euphrates before  the arrival of the Sumerian or Semitic* tribes.         * Smith (The Chaldaean Account of Genesis, p. 194) remarked       the difference between the representations of Gilgames and       the typical Babylonian: he concluded from this that the hero       was of Ethiopian origin. Hommel declares that his features       have neither a Sumerian nor Semitic aspect, and that they       raise an insoluble question in ethnology.    His figure is tall, broad, muscular to an astonishing degree, and  expresses at once vigour and activity; his head is massive, bony, almost  square, with a somewhat flattened face, a large nose, and prominent  cheek-bones, the whole framed by an abundance of hair, and a thick beard  symmetrically curled. All the young men of Uruk, the well-protected,  were captivated by the prodigious strength and beauty of the hero; the  elders of the city betook themselves to Ishtar to complain of the state  of neglect to which the young generation had relegated them. \"He has no  longer a rival in their hearts, but thy subjects are led to battle, and  Gilgames does not send one child back to his father. Night and day they  cry after him: 'It is he the shepherd of Uruk, the well-protected, he  is its shepherd and master, he the powerful, the perfect and the wise.'\"  Even the women did not escape the general enthusiasm: \"he leaves not a  single virgin to her mother, a single daughter to a warrior, a single  wife to her master. Ishtar heard their complaint, the gods heard it, and  cried with a loud voice to Aruru: 'It is thou, Aruru, who hast given him  birth; create for him now his fellow, that he may be able to meet him on  a day when it pleaseth him, in order that they may fight with each other  and Uruk may be delivered.'When Aruru heard them, she created in her  heart a man of Anu. Aruru washed her hands, took a bit of clay, cast it  upon the earth, kneaded it and created Babani, the warrior, the exalted  scion, the man of Ninib, whose whole body is covered with hair, whose  tresses are as long as those of a woman; the locks of his hair bristle  on his head like those on the corn-god; he is clad in a vestment  like that of the god of the fields; he browses with the gazelles, he  quenches his thirst with the beasts of the field, he sports with the  beasts of the waters.\" Frequent representations of Eabani are found upon  the monuments; he has the horns of a goat, the legs and tail of a bull.*  He possessed not only the"]]]
