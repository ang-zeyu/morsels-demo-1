By degrees Greek became the language of the upper  classes in all the Bulgarian towns, the Bulgarian language was written in  Greek characters, and the illiterate peasants, though speaking the  vernacular, called themselves Greeks. The Slavonic liturgy was suppressed  in favour of the Greek, and in many places the old Bulgarian manuscripts,  images, testaments and missals were committed to the flames. The patriots  of the literary movement, recognizing in the patriarchate the most  determined foe to a national revival, directed all their efforts to the  abolition of Greek ecclesiastical ascendancy and the restoration of the  Bulgarian autonomous church. Some of the leaders went so far as to open  negotiations with Rome, and an archbishop of the Uniate Bulgarian church  was nominated by the pope. The struggle was prosecuted with the utmost  tenacity for forty years. Incessant protests and memorials were addressed  to the Porte, and every effort was made to undermine the position of the  Greek bishops, some of whom were compelled to abandon their sees. At the  same time no pains were spared to diffuse education and to stimulate the  national sentiment. Various insurrectionary movements were attempted by the  patriots Rakovski, Panayot Khitoff, Haji Dimitr, Stephen Karaja and others,  but received little support from the mass of the people. The recognition of  Bulgarian nationality was won by the pen, not the sword. The patriarchate  at length found it necessary to offer some concessions, but these appeared  illusory to the Bulgarians, and long and acrimonious discussions followed.  Eventually the Turkish government intervened, and on the 28th of February  1870 a firman was issued establishing the Bulgarian exarchate, with  jurisdiction over fifteen dioceses, including Nish, Pirot and Veles; the  other dioceses in dispute were to be added to these in case two-thirds of  the Christian population so desired. The election of the first exarch was  delayed till February 1872, owing to the opposition of the patriarch, who  immediately afterwards excommunicated the new head of the Bulgarian church  and all his followers. The official recognition now acquired tended to  consolidate the Bulgarian nation and to prepare it for the political  developments which were soon to follow. A great educational activity at  once displayed itself in all the districts subjected to the new  ecclesiastical power.    _The Revolt of 1876._--Under the enlightened administration of Midhat Pasha  (1864-1868) Bulgaria enjoyed comparative prosperity, but that remarkable  man is not remembered with gratitude by the people owing to the severity  with which he repressed insurrectionary movements. In 1861, 12,000 Crimean  Tatars, and in 1864 a still larger number of Circassians from the Caucasus,  were settled by the Turkish government on lands taken without compensation  from the Bulgarian peasants. The Circassians, a lawless race of  mountaineers, proved a veritable scourge to the population in their  neighbourhood. In 1875 the insurrection in Bosnia and Herzegovina produced  immense excitement throughout the Peninsula. The fanaticism of the Moslems  was aroused, and the Bulgarians, fearing a general massacre of Christians,  endeavoured to anticipate the blow by organizing a general revolt. The  rising, which broke out prematurely at Koprivshtitza and Panagurishte in  May 1876, was mainly confined to the sanjak of Philippopolis. Bands of  bashi-bazouks were let loose throughout the district by the Turkish  authorities, the Pomaks, or Moslem Bulgarians, and the Circassian colonists  were called to arms, and a succession of horrors followed to which a  parallel can scarcely be found in the history of the middle ages. The  principal scenes of massacre were Panagurishte, Perushtitza, Bratzigovo and  Batak; at the last-named town, according to an official British report,  5000 men, women and children were put to the sword by the Pomaks under  Achmet Aga, who was decorated by the sultan for this exploit. Altogether  some 15,000 persons were massacred in the [v.04 p.0782] district of  Philippopolis, and fifty-eight villages and five monasteries were  destroyed. Isolated risings which took place on the northern side of the  Balkans were crushed with similar barbarity. These atrocities, which were  first made known by an English journalist and an American consular  official, were denounced by Gladstone in a celebrated pamphlet which  aroused the indignation of Europe. The great powers remained inactive, but  Servia declared war in the following month, and her army was joined by 2000  Bulgarian volunteers. A conference of the representatives of the powers,  held at Constantinople towards the end of the year, proposed, among other  reforms, the organization of the Bulgarian provinces, including the greater  part of Macedonia, in two vilayets under Christian governors, with popular  representation. These recommendations were practically set aside by the  Porte, and in April 1877 Russia declared war (see RUSSO-TURKISH WARS, and  PLEVNA). In the campaign which followed the Bulgarian volunteer contingent  in the Russian army played an honourable part; it accompanied Gourko's  advance over the Balkans, behaved with great bravery at Stara Zagora, where  it lost heavily, and rendered valuable services in the defence of Shipka.    _Treaties of San Stefano and Berlin._--The victorious advance of the  Russian army to Constantinople was followed by the treaty of San Stefano  (3rd March 1878), which realized almost to the full the national  aspirations of the Bulgarian race. All the provinces of European Turkey in  which the Bulgarian element predominated were now included in an autonomous  principality, which extended from the Black Sea to the Albanian mountains,  and from the Danube to the Aegean, enclosing Ochrida, the ancient capital  of the Shishmans, Dibra and Kastoria, as well as the districts of Vranya  and Pirot, and possessing a Mediterranean port at Kavala. The Dobrudja,  notwithstanding its Bulgarian population, was not included in the new  state, being reserved as compensation to Rumania for the Russian annexation  of Bessarabia; Adrianople, Salonica and the Chalcidian peninsula were left  to Turkey. The area thus delimited constituted three-fifths of the Balkan  Peninsula, with a population of 4,000,000 inhabitants. The great powers,  however, anticipating that this extensive territory would become a Russian  dependency, intervened; and on the 13th of July of the same year was signed  the treaty of Berlin, which in effect divided the \"Big Bulgaria\" of the  treaty of San Stefano into three portions. The limits of the principality  of Bulgaria, as then defined, and the autonomous province of Eastern  Rumelia, have been already described; the remaining portion, including  almost the whole of Macedonia and part of the vilayet of Adrianople, was  left under Turkish administration. No special organization was provided for  the districts thus abandoned; it was stipulated that laws similar to the  organic law of Crete should be introduced into the various parts of Turkey  in Europe, but this engagement was never carried out by the Porte. Vranya,  Pirot and Nish were given to Servia, and the transference of the Dobrudja  to Rumania was sanctioned. This artificial division of the Bulgarian nation  could scarcely be regarded as possessing elements of permanence. It was  provided that the prince of Bulgaria should be freely elected by the  population, and confirmed by the Sublime Porte with the assent of the  powers, and that, before his election, an assembly of Bulgarian notables,  convoked at Trnovo, should draw up the organic law of the principality. The  drafting of a constitution for Eastern Rumelia was assigned to a European  commission.    _The Constitution of Trnovo._--Pending the completion of their political  organization, Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia were occupied by Russian troops  and administered by Russian officials. The assembly of notables, which met  at Trnovo in 1879, was mainly composed of half-educated peasants, who from  the first displayed an extremely democratic spirit, in which they proceeded  to manipulate the very liberal constitution submitted to them by Prince  Dondukov-Korsakov, the Russian governor-general. The long period of Turkish  domination had effectually obliterated all social distinctions, and the  radical element, which now formed into a party under Tzankoff and  Karaveloff, soon gave evidence of its predominance. Manhood suffrage, a  single chamber, payment of deputies, the absence of property qualification  for candidates, and the prohibition of all titles and distinctions, formed  salient features in the constitution now elaborated. The organic statute of  Eastern Rumelia was largely modelled on the Belgian constitution. The  governor-general, nominated for five years by the sultan with the  approbation of the powers, was assisted by an assembly, partly  representative, partly composed of _ex-officio_ members; a permanent  committee was entrusted with the preparation of legislative measures and  the general supervision of the administration, while a council of six  \"directors\" fulfilled the duties of a ministry.    _Prince Alexander._--On the 29th of April 1879 the assembly at Trnovo, on  the proposal of Russia, elected as first sovereign of Bulgaria Prince  Alexander of Battenberg, a member of the grand ducal house of Hesse and a  nephew of the tsar Alexander II. Arriving in Bulgaria on the 7th of July,  Prince Alexander, then in his twenty-third year, found all the authority,  military and civil, in Russian hands. The history of the earlier portion of  his reign is marked by two principal features--a strong Bulgarian reaction  against Russian tutelage and a vehement struggle against the autocratic  institutions which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#9)"],[1,"the entrance, and the ants  attempt to crawl over it and are glued to it. He walks in a very unique  way by going upon the backs of his feet. This preserves his wonderful  claws for bursting open ants' nests, as his chief food consists of these  tiny insects and their eggs.    A cousin of the scaly ant-eater, the great ant-eater of South America,  has the same general habits of his near-kinsman. He has an immense bushy  tail with which some naturalists claim he sweeps up ants. This is not  true, however; he uses his tail, when he lies down, to cover himself.  The hairs of the tail part in such a manner as to fall over the body  like a thatched roof, protecting it from rain and storm alike.    A part of the head and under portion of this ant-eater's body are  unprotected, and this is why he rolls himself up like a ball when danger  is near. In this position, his scales stand out in such a way as to make  a complete row of sharp points, as uninviting as the wires on a barbed  wire fence. Yet, it is claimed that certain of his enemies, like the  leopard, know his one great weakness--a terror of being wet--and often  make him uncoil by rolling him into the water. His coat of hard covering  is really compact masses of hardened hair drawn out to sharp dagger  points, and might be likened to pine cones endued with power. Through  ages of experience, the scaly ant-eater has learned that even his  powerful coat of protection is not altogether a success in life's  battles, and from time to time his armour has been made lighter and  lighter, and because he has been so slow in making the necessary  changes, he is to-day very scarce, and able only by the greatest caution  to drag out a dull existence as a nocturnal and burrowing animal. It  would seem that with such powerful protection as he originally had, he  would have outlived the puny armadillos, but his fast disappearance  proves that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the  strong.    Among the animals which have discarded their old-fashioned coats of  mail, and have successfully protected themselves against all enemies,  may be mentioned the frogs, newts, and their kinspeople, the reptiles.  These latter, the learned, with their delight in multiplying terms, have  classed as amphibians. During the period when the coal forests were  growing over what we now know as England, there were innumerable  amphibians, and even to-day their petrified footmarks are found in  sandstone. The underside of their chests were covered with large bony  plates, and in some cases the rest of the body was covered with  scale-like bones. Yet, all the newts and frogs of to-day have wisely  discarded the old coats of armour used by their forefathers.    The armadillo has an armour of quite another kind, notwithstanding the  fact that pangolins and armadillos belong to the same great family, and  each eats ants. Their plates of armour, or shields, have nothing at all  to do with the hair, nor do they have anything to do with the  exo-skeleton; they are formed of bone material, which appears in the  true skin in the form of tiny shields, and each shield is itself  covered with a hard plate which grows in the outer skin. The actual  formation of these shields differs largely in the various species of  armadillo.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    NAOSAURUS AND DIMETRODON, TWO EXTINCT ARMOUR-BEARERS WHO SHOULD HAVE  BEEN WELL ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.]    [Illustration: AN ARMOUR-BEARER OF PREHISTORIC TIMES WHOSE SHIELD WAS AN  EFFECTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST ENEMY HORNS.]    It is well to remember that the pangolins and armadillos are the last  survivors of a great and ancient family of armour-bearers. Many of their  remote ancestors have been found in the rocks and hills of South  America, and all of their representatives of to-day are small  animals--the last of a doomed race--creatures of yesterday. The  glyptodon is known to have been more than eleven feet in length, and his  near-kinsman, the chlamydothere, was even larger. He was nearly the size  of our present-day rhinoceros. These extinct giants carried on their  backs huge domes of bony plates, that must have rivalled our much-feared  tanks, of trench war fame. One would think they were invulnerable, yet  the glyptodon and the chlamydothere, with many other equally well  protected creatures, have long ago disappeared from the earth, but how  and why nobody knows. This total disappearance of these marvellously  protected giants, which seemed capable of defending themselves against  any and all kinds of enemies that might have arisen, is one of the  strangest and most unsolvable problems of science.    Another mail-clad animal of importance is the armadillo of the tropical  and temperate regions of South America. He is nocturnal in habits,  sleeping in his underground home during the day, and coming out at night  to seek for food. This underground home is rather large, and the nursery  is well protected from enemies by its location. In it the mother  armadillo rears her young until they are large enough to care for  themselves.    All species of the armadillos are powerful burrowers, and they are well  equipped for their tunnelling in the earth with strong fore limbs. They  feed upon all kinds of insects and animal substances. It is claimed that  the giant armadillo is a veritable grave-robber and sometimes digs up  dead bodies for the purpose of eating them.    These animals are plentiful upon the savannas of South America, and they  feast upon the bodies of dead cattle. So hard are their coats of armour  that the Gauchos sharpen their Spanish knives, which they always carry,  upon them. Should the armadillo be attacked by a man on horseback, he  will burrow so rapidly that only by the quickest movements of the man  can he be caught; and if he is, watch out for his terrible claws!    No animal is better protected by nature from its enemies than the  pichiciago, whose scientific name is _chlamyphorus truncatus_. This  strange little mantle-bearer wears a coat of mail which is as flexible  as the human-made coats of armour of olden times, and he is as safe  under its cover, which allows him perfect freedom, as if he were under  the ground. He is about the size of the ordinary mole, and his general  habits are not unlike those of the mole. He is an underground-dweller,  with enormous fore-paws, palm-shaped, upon which are five powerful  claws. These he uses to great advantage in digging in the earth for  insects and for building his home. He has a small snout, reminding one  of that of a pig; while his piercing little eyes are deeply hidden in  his fur. He is a native of Chile, and because of his shy nature and  subterranean habits is rarely seen.    The most interesting feature about this little creature is the cuirass  which so perfectly protects his body. Its formation and arrangement is  quite unusual; it appears like a number of squared plates of horn,  tightly united to short strips of tape, which are sewed together. The  cuirass is not connected with the entire body of the animal, but only on  the top of the head and along the spine. It covers the entire back, and  when it reaches the tail, turns downward, forming a perfect flap, which  protects the hindquarters.    The various species of manis are famed for their powerful coats of  armour. They, also, belong to the great group of burrowers, and their  coats of mail assume both offensive and defensive characters. These  mail-bearers are covered with numerous sharp-edged scales, like  miniature horns, which entirely overlap one another, like shingles on a  house. They are of great hardness, and form a belt which no animal of  their regions can penetrate. A revolver shot will produce not the  slightest effect upon the body of this iron-protected animal.    These animals are plentiful in India, and when they are molested, they  deliberately wind themselves up, coil their tails over their bodies, and  remain in conscious security against the fruitless blows of their  enemies, who soon weary of the wounds caused from the prickly scales of  impenetrable armour.    Instead of wearing heavy coats of mail, certain animals, such as the  hedgehog and porcupine, prefer to wear coats covered with needles and  pins. Of course, a coat of spines is used purely for protection. And  against the attacks of such enemies as dogs, it proves all-sufficient,  but it is a well-known fact that pumas and leopards will kill and eat  porcupines at all times, paying small attention to their spines, as is  shown by the number which are sometimes found sticking in the body of a  porcupine-eating animal.    There are several species of this great spine-bearing family; and many  of them, especially the true porcupines and the echidnas, have burrows  in the ground and thus have a double means of protecting themselves. But  others, such as the hedgehog, depend for their protection upon their  ability to roll up into a ball, thus presenting a barbed wire  protection. Still others live largely in the trees and seek by other  means to protect themselves.    One of the most interesting coats of armour is that worn by the  porcupine ant-eater--oft-times erroneously called porcupine or hedgehog.  He is a native of Australia, and is a powerful burrower. He is  marvellously protected by means of a coat of needles or spines which  inflict painful wounds on the dog or other enemy that ventures to attack  him. In case of danger, he curls himself up into a ball, and defies any  one to come near. Not only does he possess the coat of prickles with  which he defends himself, but he also has a large perforated claw or  spur on each hind foot through which pours an ill-smelling liquid, and  these also aid in protecting him. There are several varieties of  porcupines which inhabit Asia, Africa, Southern Europe and America.    When a porcupine wishes to attack an enemy, he rushes "]]]
