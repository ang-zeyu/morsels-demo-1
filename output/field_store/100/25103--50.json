Giovanni on the Albano  road (to be reached also from the Tavolato station, on the upper Albano  railway); the other is the Vicolo del Mandrione, which leaves the  Labicana one mile outside the Porta Maggiore and falls into the  Tusculana at the place called Porta Furba.          THE QUARRIES AND BRICKS OF THE ANCIENT CITY[16]    BY RODOLFO LANCIANI      The materials used in Roman constructions are the \"lapis ruber\" (tufa);  the \"lapis Albanus\" (peperino); the \"lapis Gabinus\" (sperone); the  \"lapis Tiburtinus\" (travertino); the silex (\"selce\"); and bricks and  tiles of various kinds. The cement was composed of pozzolana and lime.  Imported marbles came into fashion toward the end of the republic, and  became soon after the pride and glory of Rome....    The only material which the first builders of Rome found at hand was the  volcanic conglomerate called tufa. The quality of the stone used in  those early days was far from perfect. The walls of the Palatine hill  and of the Capitoline citadel were built of material quarried on the  spot--a mixture of charred pumice-stones and reddish volcanic sand. The  quarries used for the fortification of the Capitol were located at the  foot of the hill toward the Argiletum, and were so important as to give  their name, Lautumiae, to the neighboring district. It is probable that  the prison called Tullianum, from a jet of water, \"tullus,\" which sprang  from the rock, was originally a portion of this quarry. The tufa blocks  employed by Servius Tullius for the building of the city walls, and of  the agger, appear to be of three qualities--yellowish, reddish, and  gray; the first, soft and easily broken up, seems to have been quarried  from the Little Aventine, near the church of St. Saba. The galleries of  this quarry, much disfigured by medieval and modern use, can be followed  to a considerable distance, altho the collapsing of the vaults makes it  dangerous to visit them....    The quarries of the third quality were, or rather one of them was,  discovered on February 7, 1872, in the Vigna Querini, outside the Porta  St. Lorenzo, near the first milestone of the Vicolo di Valle Cupa. It  was a surface quarry, comprising five trenches 16 feet wide, 9 feet  deep. Some of the blocks, already squared, were lying on the floor of  the trenches, others were detached on two or three sides only, the size  of others was simply traced on the rock by vertical or horizontal lines.  This tufa, better known by the name of cappellaccio, is very bad. The  only buildings in which it was used, besides the inner wall of the  Servian agger, are the platform of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, in  the gardens of the German Embassy, and the \"puticuli\" in the  burial-grounds of the Esquiline. Its use must have been given up before  the end of the period of the Kings, in consequence of the discovery of  better quarries on the right bank of the Tiber, at the foot of the  hills now called Monte Verde....    They cover a space one mile in length and a quarter of a mile wide on  each side of the valley of Pozzo Pantaleo. In fact, this valley, which  runs from the Via Portuensis toward the lake of the Villa Pamphili,  seems to be artificial; I mean, produced by the extraction of the rock  of millions of cubic meters in the course of twenty-four centuries. If  the work of the ancient quarrymen could be freed from the loose material  which conceals it from view, we should possess within a few minutes'  drive from the Porta Portese a reproduction of the famous mines of El  Masarah, with beds of rock cut into steps and terraces, with roads and  lanes, shafts, inclines, underground passages, and outlets for the  discharge of rain-water. When a quarry had given out, its galleries were  filled up with the refuse of the neighboring ones--chips left over after  the squaring of the blocks; so that, in many cases, the color and  texture of the chips do not correspond with those of the quarry in which  they are found. This layer of refuse, transformed by time into humus,  and worked upon by human and atmospheric forces, has given the valley a  different aspect, so that it looks as if it were the work not of  quarrymen, but of nature.    Tufa may be found used in many existing monuments of ancient Rome, such  as the drains of the middle and southern basin of the left bank, the  channels and arches of the Marcia and Anio Vetus, the Servian walls, the  temples of Fortuna Virilis, of Hercules Magnus Custos, the Rostra, the  embankment of the Tiber, etc. The largest and most magnificent quarries  in the suburban district are the so-called Grotte della Cervara. No  words can convey an idea of their size and of the regularity of their  plan. They seem to be the work of a fanciful architect who has hewn out  of the rock halls and galleries, courts and vestibules, and imitated the  forms of an Assyrian palace.    For the study of the peperino mines, which contain a stone special to  the Alban district, formed by the action of hot water on gray volcanic  cinders, the reader should follow on foot the line of the new Albano  railway, from the place called Il Sassone to the town of Marino. Many of  the valleys in this district, now made beautiful by vineyards and  oliveyards, owe their existence to the pickax of the Roman stonecutter,  like the valley of Pozzo Pantaleo. The most curious sight is a dolmen or  isolated rock 10 meters high, left in the center of one of the quarries  to certify the thickness of the bed of rock excavated. In fact, the  whole district is very interesting both to the archeologist and to the  paysagiste. The mines of Marino, still worked in the neighborhood of the  railway station, would count, like the Grotte della Cervara, among the  wonders of the Campagna, were they known to the student as they deserve  to be.    The principal Roman buildings in which the lapis Albanus has been used  are: the Claudian aqueduct, the Cloaca Maxima, the temples of Antonius  and Faustina, of Cybele, of the Eventus Bonus, of Neptune, the inclosure  wall of the Forum Augustum, Forum Transitorium, and Forum Pacis, the  Porticus Argonautarum, Porticus Pompeii, the Ustrinum of the Appian Way,  etc. The sarcophagus of Cornelius Scipio Barbatus in the Vatican  museum, and the tomb of the Tibicines in the Museo Municipale al Celio  are also of this stone.    Travertine stone was quarried in the plains of Tivoli at places now  called Le Caprine, Casal Bernini, and Il Barco. This last was reopened  after an interval of many centuries by Count G. Brazza, brother of the  African explorer. Lost in the wilderness and overgrown with shrubs, it  had not been examined, I believe, since the visit of Brocchi. It can be  reached by stopping at the station of the Aquae Albulae, on the Tivoli  line, and following the ancient road which led to the works. This road,  twice as wide as the Appian Way, is flanked by substructures, and is not  paved, but macadamized. Parallel with it runs an aqueduct which supplied  the works with motive power, derived probably from the sulfur springs.  There are also remains of tombs, one of which, octagonal in shape,  serves as a foundation to the farmhouse del Barco.    The most remarkable monument of the whole group is the Roman quarry from  which five and a half million cubic meters of travertine have been  extracted, as proved by the measurement of the hollow space between the  two opposite vertical sides. That this is the most important ancient  quarry of travertine, and the largest one used by the Romans, is proved,  in the first place, by its immense size. The sides show a frontage of  more than two and a half kilometers; the surface amounts to 500,000  square meters. The sides are quite perpendicular, and have the  peculiarity of projecting buttresses, at an angle of 90 degrees. Some of  these buttresses are isolated on three sides, and still preserve the  grooves, by means of which they could be separated from the solid  mass....    In order to keep the bottom of the works clean and free from the  movement of the carts, for the action of the cranes, and for the  maneuvres of the workmen, the chips, or useless product of the squaring  of the blocks, were transported to a great distance, as far as the banks  of the Anio, and there piled up to a great height. This is the origin of  that chain of hills which runs parallel to the river, and of whose  artificial formation no one, as far as I know, had the least suspicion.  One of these hills, visible from every point of the neighboring  district, from Hadrian's villa as well as from the Sulfur Baths, is  elliptical in shape, 22 meters high, 90 meters long, and 65 meters wide.  It can with reason be compared with our Testaccio. It is easy to imagine  how immense must have been the number of blocks cut from the Cava del  Barco during the period of the formation of this hill alone. Another  proof of the antiquity of the quarry, and of its abandonment from  imperial times down to our own day, is given by this fact....    There are three collections of brick-stamps in Rome; one, of little  value, in the Kircherian museum; the second in the last room of the  Vatican library, past the \"Nozze aldobrandine;\" the third and best in  the Museo Municipale al Celio. This last contains over a thousand  specimens, and a unique set of the products of Roman kilns. In fact, the  first hall of the Museo is set apart exclusively for the study of  ancient building and decorative materials.    Roman bricks were square, oblong, triangular, or round, the latter being  used only to build columns in the Pompeiian style. The largest bricks  that have been discovered in my time measure 1.05 meters in length.  They were set into an arch of one of the great stairs leading to the  avenue or boulevard established in Imperial times on the top of the  agger of Servius. Roman bricks are very often stamped with a seal, the  legend of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#9)"],[1,"se,\" he reported. \"It could be one of half a dozen drugs, or  some native stuff from here which we've never classified.\"    \"True. There are drugs we have found here.\" Asaki scowled down at the  green mat of jungle. \"So our water is poisoned?\"    \"Do you always purify it?\" Tau asked the Chief Ranger. \"Surely during  the centuries since your ancestors landed on Khatka you must have  adapted to native water. You couldn't have lived otherwise. We must use  the purifier, but must you?\"    \"There is water and water.\" Asaki shook his own canteen, his scowl  growing fiercer as the gurgle from its depths was heard. \"From springs  on the other side of the mountains we drink--yes. But over here, this  close to the Mygra swamps, we have not done so. We may have to chance  it.\"    \"Do you think we are literally poisoned?\" Jellico bored directly to the  heart of their private fears.    \"None of us have been drinking too heavily,\" Tau observed thoughtfully.  \"And I don't believe Lumbrilo had outright killing in mind. How long the  effect will last I have no way of telling.\"    \"If we saw one rock ape,\" Dane wondered, \"why didn't we see others? And  why here and now?\"    \"That!\" Tau pointed ahead on the trail Asaki had picked for their  ascent. For a long moment Dane could see nothing of any interest there  and then he located it--a finger of rock. It did not point directly  skyward this time, in fact it slanted so that its tip indicated their  back trail. Yet in outline the spire was very similar to that outcrop  from which the real rock ape had charged them the day before.    Asaki exclaimed in his own tongue and slapped his hand hard against the  stock of the needler.    \"We saw that and so again we saw an ape also! Had earlier we been  charged by graz or jumped by a lion in such a place, then again we would  have been faced by graz or lion here!\"    Captain Jellico gave a bark of laughter colored only by the most  sardonic humor. \"Clever enough. He merely leaves it to us to select our  own ghost and then repeat the performance in the next proper setting. I  wonder how many rocks shaped like that one there are in these mountains?  And how long will a rock ape continue to pop out from behind each one we  do find?\"    \"Who knows? But as long as we drink this water we're going to continue  to have trouble; I feel safe in promising that,\" Tau replied. He put  the vial of doctored purifier into a separate pocket of his medical kit.  \"It may be a problem of how long we can go without water.\"    \"Perhaps,\" Asaki said softly. \"Only not all the water on Khatka comes  running in streams.\"    \"Fruit?\" Tau asked.    \"No, trees. Lumbrilo is not a hunter, nor could he be certain when and  where his magic would go to work. Unless the flitter was deliberately  sabotaged, he was planning for us to use our canteens in the preserve.  That is lion country and there are long distances between springs. This  is jungle below us and there is a source there I think we can safely  tap. But first I must find Nymani and prove to him that this is truly  deviltry of a sort, but not demon inspired.\"    He was gone, running lightly down-slope in the direction his hunter had  taken, and Dane spoke to Captain Jellico.    \"What's this about water in trees, sir?\"    \"There is a species of tree here, not too common, with a thickened  trunk. It stores water during the rainy season to live on in the hot  months. Since we are in the transition period between rains, we could  tap it--if we locate one of the trees. How about that, Tau? Dare we  drink that without a purifier?\"    \"Probably a choice of two evils, sir. But we have had our preventive  shots. Personally, I'd rather battle disease than take a chance on a  mind-twisting drug. You can go without water just so long....\"    \"I'd like to have a little talk with Lumbrilo,\" remarked Jellico, the  mildness in his voice very deceptive.    \"I'm _going_ to have a little talk with Lumbrilo, if and when we see him  again!\" promised Tau.    \"What are our chances, sir?\" Dane asked. He screwed the cap back on his  canteen, his mouth feeling twice as dry since he knew he dared not  drink.    \"Well, we've faced gambles before.\" Tau sealed the medical kit. \"I'd  like to see one of those trees before sundown. And I don't want to face  another pointed rock today!\"    \"Why the leopard?\" asked Jellico reflectively. \"Another case of using  flame to fight fire? But Lumbrilo wasn't among those present to be  impressed.\"    Tau rubbed his hand across his forehead. \"I don't really know, sir.  Maybe I could have made the ape vanish without a counter projection, but  I don't think so. With these hallucinations it is better to battle one  vision against another for the benefit of those involved. And I can't  even tell you why I selected a leopard--it just flashed into mind as  about the fastest and most deadly animal fighter I could recall at that  moment.\"    \"You'd better work out a good list of such fighters.\" Jellico's grim  humor showed again. \"I can supply a few if you need them. Not that I  don't share your hope we won't see any more trigger rocks. Here comes  Asaki with his wandering boy.\"    The Chief Ranger was half-leading, half-supporting his hunter, and  Nymani seemed only half-conscious. Tau got to his feet and hurried to  meet them. It would appear that their search for the water tree would be  delayed.          VI      They withdrew to a spot hacked from the edge of the jungle, leaving a  screen of green between them and the traitorous up-slope. But within the  few hours of daylight left them, it was proven that Asaki had been  overly optimistic in his hopes of discovering a water tree. They were  now in a narrow tongue of land between the range and the swamps, and  this territory was limited. Nymani, still shaken, was of little help,  and the spacemen did not dare to strike out into unexplored land alone.    So they mouthed dry concentrates and dared not drink. Dane was tempted  to pour out the liquid in his canteen. Water so close to hand was a  continual torment. And, now that they were away from the heights and the  possibility of more finger-shaped rocks, surely the threat in that  moisture was small in comparison to the needs of his body. Only that  caution which was drilled into every Free Trader supplied a brake to his  thirst.    Jellico drew the back of his hand across cracked lips. \"Suppose we  should draw lots--some of us drink, one or two not. Could we manage that  way until we were over the mountains?\"    \"I wouldn't want to chance it, unless we are left with no other choice.  There is no way of telling how long the drug works. Frankly, right now  I'm not even sure I could detect a hallucination for very long under  these conditions,\" was Tau's discouraging verdict.    If any of them slept that night, they did so only in snatches. The  apprehension which had come with the previous night was back,  intensified, and that lurking, indefinable fear rode them hard.    They were shaken out of their private terrors shortly after dawn. There  were always sounds to be heard in the jungle: the cries of unseen birds,  the crash of some tree eaten alive by parasitic sapping. But what broke  now was no bird call, no isolated tree falling. A trumpeting roar, the  crackling smash of vegetation, heralded a real menace. Asaki spun to  face northward, though there was nothing to be seen there except the  unshaken wall of the jungle.    \"Graz! Graz on stampede!\" Nymani joined his superior.    Jellico arose swiftly and Dane read on the captain's face the  seriousness of this. The off-worlder turned to his own men with a sharp  order. \"On your feet! We may have to move on the double. Up-mountain?\"  he demanded of the Chief Ranger.    The other was still listening, not only with his ears but with the whole  of his tense body. Three of the deer-like creatures they had hunted for  food broke out of the green wall, fled past the men as if the latter was  invisible. And behind them, the hunted now and not the hunter, came a  lion, its strikingly marked black-and-white hide dramatic in the light  of the morning. It showed fangs in a snarl and then was gone in one huge  bound. More deer things, scurrying of other small creatures, moving too  fast for clear identification, and behind them the fury of destruction  which marked the headlong advance of Khatka's largest mammals slamming  through the jungle.    They had started up-slope when Nymani cried out. A white bulk, hard to  distinguish in that light against the gray of the earth, headed after  them. Dane had a fleeting glimpse of curled tusks, of an open mouth,  raw-red and wide enough to engulf his whole head, of shaggy legs driving  at an unbelievable pace. Asaki snapped a beam from the needler. The  white monster roared and came on. They dived for the scant cover offered  as the graz bull died, not two yards away from the Chief Ranger, its  heavy body skidding along the earth with the force of its speed as it  went down.    \"That did it!\" Jellico sighted coolly with his blaster as a second bull,  fighting mad, tore from the jungle and pounded at them. Behind it a  third tusked head thrust out of the brush, large eyes searched for an  enemy. Dane studied the dead bull, but the animal did not come to life  this time. These were not hallucinations. And the malignancy of the rock  apes, the cunning of the native Khatkan lion, were pallid things  compared to a graz herd on the rampage.    The second bull yelped with an almost canine complaint as Jellico's  blaster caught it head-on. Blinded, the beast blundered ahead, climbing  the mountain side. The third met a ray from Nymani's needler. But the  Chief Ranger leaped from behind his sheltering rock to the one where the  captain had taken refuge and pulled him into the open.    \"They must not corner us here!\"    Jellico agreed to that. \"Come on!\" he barked to Tau and Dane.    They fled along a rough way, trying to gain altitude,"]]]
