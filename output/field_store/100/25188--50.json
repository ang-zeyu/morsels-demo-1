That mutual intolerance of differences in religious belief which, in the  seventeenth century, was, throughout Christendom, coextensive with  religious earnestness had its important part to play in the colonization  of America. Of the persecutions and oppressions which gave direct  impulse to the earliest colonization of America, the most notable are  the following: (1) the persecution of the English Puritans in the reigns  of James I. and Charles I., ending with the outbreak of the civil war in  1642; (2) the persecution of the English Roman Catholics during the same  period; (3) the persecution of the English Quakers during the  twenty-five years of Charles II. (1660-85); (4) the persecution of the  French Huguenots after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685); (5)  the disabilities suffered by the Presbyterians of the north of Ireland  after the English Revolution (1688); (6) the ferocious ravaging of the  region of the Rhenish Palatinate by the armies of Louis XIV. in the  early years of the seventeenth century; (7) the cruel expulsion of the  Protestants of the archiepiscopal duchy of Salzburg (1731).    Beyond dispute, the best and most potent elements in the settlement of  the seaboard colonies were the companies of earnestly religious people  who from time to time, under severe compulsion for conscience' sake,  came forth from the Old World as involuntary emigrants. Cruel wars and  persecutions accomplished a result in the advancement of the kingdom of  Christ which the authors of them never intended. But not these agencies  alone promoted the great work. Peace, prosperity, wealth, and the hope  of wealth had their part in it. The earliest successful enterprises of  colonization were indeed marked with the badge of Christianity, and  among their promoters were men whose language and deeds nobly evince the  Christian spirit; but the enterprises were impelled and directed by  commercial or patriotic considerations. The immense advantages that were  to accrue from them to the world through the wider propagation of the  gospel of Christ were not lost sight of in the projecting and organizing  of the expeditions, nor were provisions for church and ministry omitted;  but these were incidental, not primary.    This story of the divine preparations carried forward through  unconscious human agencies in different lands and ages for the founding  of the American church is a necessary preamble to our history. The scene  of the story is now to be shifted to the other side of the sea.          CHAPTER V.    THE PURITAN BEGINNINGS OF THE CHURCH IN VIRGINIA--ITS DECLINE ALMOST TO  EXTINCTION.      There is sufficient evidence that the three little vessels which on the  13th of May, 1607, were moored to the trees on the bank of the James  River brought to the soil of America the germ of a Christian church. We  may feel constrained to accept only at a large discount the pious  official professions of King James I., and critically to scrutinize many  of the statements of that brilliant and fascinating adventurer, Captain  John Smith, whether concerning his friends or concerning his enemies or  concerning himself. But the beauty and dignity of the Christian  character shine unmistakable in the life of the chaplain to the  expedition, the Rev. Robert Hunt, and all the more radiantly for the  dark and discouraging surroundings in which his ministry was to be  exercised.    For the company which Captain Smith and that famous mariner, Captain  Bartholomew Gosnold, had by many months of labor and \"many a forgotten  pound\" of expense succeeded in recruiting for the enterprise was made up  of most unhopeful material for the founding of a Christian colony. Those  were the years of ignoble peace with which the reign of James began; and  the glittering hopes of gold might well attract some of the brave men  who had served by sea or land in the wars of Elizabeth. But the last  thirty years had furnished no instance of success, and many of  disastrous and sometimes tragical failure, in like attempts--the  enterprises of Humphrey Gilbert, of Raleigh, of John White, of Gosnold  himself, and of Popham and Gorges. Even brave men might hesitate to  volunteer for the forlorn hope of another experiment at colonizing.    The little squadron had hardly set sail when the unfitness of the  emigrants for their work began to discover itself. Lying weather-bound  within sight of home, \"some few, little better than atheists, of the  greatest rank among them,\" were busying themselves with scandalous  imputations upon the chaplain, then lying dangerously ill in his berth.  All through the four months' passage by way of the Canaries and the West  India Islands discontents and dissensions prevailed. Wingfield, who had  been named president of the colony, had Smith in irons, and at the  island of Nevis had the gallows set up for his execution on a charge of  conspiracy, when milder counsels prevailed, and he was brought to  Virginia, where he was tried and acquitted and his adversary mulcted in  damages.    Arrived at the place of settlement, the colonists set about the work of  building their houses, but found that their total number of one hundred  and five was made up in the proportion of four carpenters to forty-eight  \"gentlemen.\" Not inadequately provisioned for their work, they came  repeatedly almost to perishing through their sheer incapacity and  unthrift, and their needless quarrels with one another and with the  Indians. In five months one half of the company were dead. In January,  1608, eight months from the landing, when the second expedition arrived  with reinforcements and supplies, only thirty-eight were surviving out  of the one hundred and five, and of these the strongest were conspiring  to seize the pinnace and desert the settlement.    The newcomers were no better than the first. They were chiefly  \"gentlemen\" again, and goldsmiths, whose duty was to discover and refine  the quantities of gold that the stockholders in the enterprise were  resolved should be found in Virginia, whether it was there or not. The  ship took back on her return trip a full cargo of worthless dirt.    Reinforcements continued to arrive every few months, the quality of  which it might be unfair to judge simply from the disgusted complaints  of Captain Smith. He begs the Company to send but thirty honest laborers  and artisans, \"rather than a thousand such as we have,\" and reports the  next ship-load as \"fitter to breed a riot than to found a colony.\" The  wretched settlement became an object of derision to the wits of London,  and of sympathetic interest to serious minds. The Company, reorganized  under a new charter, was strengthened by the accession of some of the  foremost men in England, including four bishops, the Earl of  Southampton, and Sir Francis Bacon. Appeals were made to the Christian  public in behalf of an enterprise so full of promise of the furtherance  of the gospel. A fleet of nine ships was fitted out, carrying more than  five hundred emigrants, with ample supplies. Captain Smith, representing  what there was of civil authority in the colony, had a brief struggle  with their turbulence, and recognized them as of the same sort with the  former companies, for the most part \"poor gentlemen, tradesmen,  serving-men, libertines, and such like, ten times more fit to spoil a  commonwealth than either begin one or help to maintain one.\" When only  part of this expedition had arrived, Captain Smith departed for England,  disabled by an accidental wound, leaving a settlement of nearly five  hundred men, abundantly provisioned. \"It was not the will of God that  the new state should be formed of these materials.\"[41:1] In six months  the number of the colonists was reduced to sixty, and when relief  arrived it was reckoned that in ten days' longer delay they would have  perished to the last man. With one accord the wretched remnant of the  colony, together with the latest comers, deserted, without a tear of  regret, the scene of their misery. But their retreating vessels were met  and turned back from the mouth of the river by the approaching ships of  Lord de la Warr with emigrants and supplies. Such were the first three  unhappy and unhonored years of the first Christian colony on the soil of  the United States.    One almost shrinks from being assured that this worthless crew, through  all these years of suicidal crime and folly, had been assiduous in  religious duties. First under an awning made of an old sail, seated upon  logs, with a rail nailed to two trees for a pulpit, afterward in a poor  shanty of a church, \"that could neither well defend wind nor rain,\" they  \"had daily common prayer morning and evening, every Sunday two sermons,  and every three months the holy communion, till their minister died\";  and after that \"prayers daily, with an homily on Sundays, two or three  years, till more preachers came.\" The sturdy and terrible resolution of  Captain Smith, who in his marches through the wilderness was wont to  begin the day with prayer and psalm, and was not unequal to the duty,  when it was laid on him, of giving Christian exhortation as well as  righteous punishment, and the gentle Christian influence of the Rev.  Robert Hunt, were the salt that saved the colony from utterly perishing  of its vices. It was not many months before the frail body of the  chaplain sank under the hardships of pioneer life; he is commemorated by  his comrade, the captain, as \"an honest, religious, and courageous  divine, during whose life our factions were oft qualified, our wants and  greatest extremities so comforted that they seemed easy in comparison of  what we endured after his memorable death.\" When, in 1609, in a nobler  spirit than that of mere commercial enterprise,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#9)"],[1," arches, deeply and richly moulded, supported on marble columns  carved with foliage. Over the arches is a hood mould terminating with  heads. In the spandrels are a series of deeply-sunk and moulded  quatrefoils, two of which contain sculpture. The bases of the columns  rest on a plinth. Surmounting this arcade is a moulded string, from the  level of which rise the windows, and above the windows another string  course and a second range of windows. In the centre bay, however, is  the large rose window, which is over thirty feet in diameter.    [Illustration: The Nine Altars Chapel.]    The division of the chapel into three bays is effected by two main  vaulting arches, which spring on the western side from the piers of the  east end of the choir, and on the eastern side from responds of  clustered shafts alternately of marble and stone, banded at intervals  and having richly carved capitals. The arches themselves are deeply  moulded and ornamented with dog-tooth ornament and foliage. The vault of  the central bay has eight ribs--two springing from each of the clusters  just described, and two from each of the choir piers. The vaulting of  the remaining bays is quadripartite, but has peculiarities which are  worthy of notice, arising from inequality of width. We must not omit to  call attention to the exquisite sculpture of the vaulting. The centre  has figures of the Four Evangelists, while in the north is a beautifully  executed carving of vine and grapes, and in the south, figure subjects.  Among the sculptured heads on the wall arcade at the south end, at the  western side of the two bays into which the south wall is divided, are  two which are portraits of the men to whom we owe the design and  execution of the beautiful sculpture of this chapel. One is an elderly  man, the other much younger, and both wear linen dust-caps over their  heads.    The nine lancet windows were originally filled with ancient stained  glass, which, as the reader will remember, was removed, Below each  window was an altar. They were dedicated a follows, beginning at the  south end of the chapel:--      1. S. Andrew and S. Mary Magdalene.          \\    2. S. John the Baptist and S. Margaret.       > South bay.    3. S. Thomas of Canterbury and S. Catherine. /      4. S. Oswald and S. Lawrence.                \\    5. S. Cuthbert and S. Bede.                   > Middle bay.    6. S. Martin.                                /      7. S. Peter and S. Paul.                     \\    8. S. Aidan and S. Helen.                     > North bay.    9. S. Michael the Archangel.                 /    The rose window over the lancets of the middle bay is Wyatt's  \"restoration\" of the original one. It consists of an outer circle of  twenty-four and an inner circle of twelve radiating lights, the mullions  of which are received on a foliated circle in the centre.    In the north wall of the chapel is a very fine window, known as the  Joseph window, on account of the stained glass it originally contained,  which illustrated the life-history of Joseph. It is a beautiful example  of Early Decorated or geometrical Gothic, and is of six lights. There is  an inner plane of tracery resting on clustered shafts, which is  connected to the mullions of the window proper by through stones. The  window occupies the complete width of the north end of the chapel. The  painted glass which it once contained is thus described in the \"Rites of  Durham\":        \"In the North Alley of the said Nine Altars, there is another goodly      faire great glass window, called Joseph's Window, the which hath in      it all the whole storye of Joseph, most artificially wrought in      pictures in fine coloured glass, accordinge as it is sett forth in      the Bible, verye good and godly to the beholders thereof.\"    This window deserves the attention of the architectural student, as it  is an exceedingly fine specimen of the tracery of its date.    The south wall of the chapel contains two windows, each divided by a  central mullion, and having an inner mullion connected by through  stones. They are widely splayed inwards, and separated by a group of  vaulting shafts. One or both of these windows contained stained glass,  with the history of the life and miracles of S. Cuthbert. As seen at  present, they contain tracery of the Perpendicular period, a restoration  of that inserted by Prior Wessington. Each window is of two lights,  crossed by a transom. Entry to the nine altars was provided for, as well  as from the choir and aisles, by two doors on the western side of its  north and south walls. The northern doorway is now walled up. They enter  through the wall arcade. The writer of the \"Rites of Durham\" says the  north door was made in order to bring in the body of Bishop Anthony Bek,  who is buried in the chapel. The architectural features of the doorway  would, however, seem to contradict this theory, and there is little room  to doubt that both north and south doorways formed part of the original  design of the structure.    Before leaving this interesting portion of the building we must direct  our attention to its most important contents, the #Tomb of S.  Cuthbert#. This, as at present to be seen, is a great oblong  platform, thirty-seven feet long by twenty-three feet wide, and its  upper surface or floor six feet above the floor of the chapel. Beneath a  slab in the centre the bones of the patron saint rest. The shrine of S.  Cuthbert at one time stood upon this platform, but of that no vestige  remains.    The floor of the platform is reached by two doors through the Neville  screen in the choir, and by a small stairway from the south aisle. The  wanderings of the monks of Lindisfarne with the body of their saint,  their many difficulties and trials, and their ultimate settlement at  Dunholme or Durham, have already been described. The shrine was  eventually set up in its present position by Bishop Carileph, in 1104,  when he brought it from the cloister garth from the tomb he had there  set up for its temporary reception, until his church was sufficiently  advanced to permit of its removal thither. It was visited by large  numbers of pilgrims, and many important personages were among them. Of  these may be mentioned William the Conqueror, Henry III. (1255), Edward  II. (1322), and Henry VI. (1448). The shrine was destroyed soon after  the surrender of the monastery to the Crown, in 1540, when the body was  buried beneath the place where its former receptacle had stood. There  have since this time been traditions that the exact place of the burial  was secret, and known only, according to one account, to three  Benedictine monks, who each handed the secret down to a successor. The  other tradition places the knowledge of the place of burial in the hands  of the Roman Catholic bishops of the Northern Province. One of these  traditions was made public in the year 1867, and gave the place of  interment as being under the second and third steps leading to the tower  from the south transept. This place was excavated and examined, but no  trace of any burial could be found there. It is to these traditions  that Scott refers, in _Marmion_, in the following lines:--      Chester-le-Street, and Ripon saw    His holy corpse, ere Wardilaw        Hailed him with joy and fear;    And after many wanderings past,    He chose his lordly seat at last,    Where his cathedral, huge and vast,        Looks down upon the Wear.    There deep in Durham's Gothic shade    His relics are in secret laid;        But none may know the place,    Save of his holiest servants three,    Deep sworn to solemn secrecy,        Who share that wondrous grace.    In May 1827 the grave in the Nine Altars Chapel was opened in the  presence of two of the church dignitaries and other persons. Dr Raine,  who was also present, has left a careful account of the discoveries then  made.[3] The outer coffin, that made in 1542, was first removed,  revealing a second and much decayed coffin and many bones. After the  removal of these relics the lid of a third oak coffin was revealed, in a  very advanced state of decay. This innermost coffin was covered over its  entire surface with carvings of human figures, the heads surrounded by a  nimbus. When this coffin was removed the skeleton was exposed to view,  wrapped in coverings, the outer of which had been of linen. The robes  beneath were much decayed, and only portions of them could be preserved.  On the breast of the body, among the robes, a comb was found, answering  exactly to that described by Reginald in 1104. Among the most  interesting of the finds were a stole and maniple.      [3] Raine. S. Cuthbert.    The stole is of very early date, and is of needlework in colours and  gold. The centre design is a quatrefoil, inside which is a lamb with  nimbus, and the letters AGNV DI. On either side are figures of Old  Testament prophets, with their names. Near the ends the embroidery  occurs on both sides of the stole, on the back of one of which among  foliage is the inscription AELFFLAED FIERI PRECEPIT, which is continued  on the back of the opposite end, thus--PIO EPISCOPO FRIDESTANO. The  translation of this inscription is to the effect that Aelfled commanded  the stole to be made for the pious Bishop Frithestan. The maniple is of  a similar character, and also bears ornament, figures, and  inscriptions.[4] Frithestan was made Bishop of Winchester in 905.  Aelfled, who was Queen of Eadward, the son and successor of Alfred, died  in 916. It was therefore during these ten years that she caused this  stole and maniple to be made for the Bishop Frithestan. It is recorded  that the son and successor of Eadward, by name Athelstan, when on a  journey in the north visited Chester-le-Street and the shrine of S.  Cuthbert, which was then at that place. Among other presents he left as  offerings a stole and maniple, and a girdle and two bracelets of gold.  It is a curious fact"]]]
