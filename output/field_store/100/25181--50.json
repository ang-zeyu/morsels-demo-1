A _square_ form of house will afford more area within a given line of  wall than any other _sensible_ form which may be adopted. Yet a square  house is not so agreeable to the eye as an oblong. Thus, a house should  stand somewhat broader on one front than on another. It should also be  relieved from an appearance of monotony and tameness, by one or more  wings; and such wings should, at their junction with the main building,  retreat or advance a sufficient distance from a continuous line, as to  relieve it effectually from an appearance of stiffness, and show a  different character of occupation from that of the main structure. The  front of a house should be the most imposing and finished in its  architecture of any one of its parts; and unless some motive of greater  convenience control otherwise, its entrance the most highly wrought,  as indicating the luxury of the establishment--for even the humblest  habitations have their luxuries. The side rooms, or more usually  occupied apartments, require less pretension in both architectural  effect and finish, and should wear a more subdued appearance; while the  kitchen section, and from that, the several grades of apartments  stretching beyond it, should distinctly show that they are subservient  in their character, and wear a style and finish accordingly. Thus, each  part of the house speaks for itself. It is its own finger-board,  pointing the stranger to its various accommodation, as plainly as if  written on its walls, and saying as significantly as dumb walls can do,  that here dwells a well regulated family, who have a parlor for their  friends; a library, or sitting-room for their own leisure and comfort;  an ample bedroom and nursery, for the parents and the little ones; a  kitchen for the cooking; and a scullery and closets, and all the other  etceteras which belong to a perfect family homestead.    And so with the grounds. The lawn or \"dooryard,\" should be the best kept  ground on the place. The most conspicuous part of the garden should show  its shrubbery and its flowers. The side or rear approach should be  separated from the lawn, and show its constant _business_ occupation,  and openly lead off to where men and farm stock meet on common ground,  devoted to every purpose which the farm requires. Such arrangement would  be complete in all its parts, satisfactory, and lasting. Tinsel  ornament, or gewgaw decoration should never be permitted on any building  where the sober enjoyment of agricultural life is designed. It can never  add consideration or dignity to the retired gentleman even, and least of  all should it be indulged in by the farmer, dwelling on his own  cultivated acres.          THE CONSTRUCTION OF CELLARS.      Every farm house and farm cottage, where a family of any size occupy the  latter, should have a good, substantial _stone_-walled cellar beneath  it. No room attached to the farm house is more profitable, in its  occupation, than the cellar. It is useful for storing numberless  articles which are necessary to be kept warm and dry in winter, as well  as cool in summer, of which the farmer is well aware. The walls of a  cellar should rise at least one, to two, or even three feet above the  level of the ground surrounding it, according to circumstances, and the  rooms in it well ventilated by _two_ or more sliding sash windows in  each, according to size, position, and the particular kind of storage  for which it is required, so that a draft of pure air can pass through,  and give it thorough ventilation at all times. It should also be at  least seven and a half feet high in the clear; and if it be even nine  feet, that is not too much. If the soil be compact, or such as will hold  water, it should be thoroughly drained from the lowest point or corner,  and the drain always kept open; (a stone drain is the best and most  durable,) and if floored with a coat of flat, or rubble stones, well set  in good hydraulic cement--or cement alone, when the stone cannot be  obtained--all the better. This last will make it _rat proof_. For the  purpose of avoiding these destructive creatures, the _foundation_ stones  in the wall should be brought to a joint, and project at least six  inches on each side, from the wall itself, when laid upon this bottom  course; as the usual manner of rats is to burrow in a nearly  perpendicular direction from the surface, by the side of the wall, when  intending to undermine it. On arriving at the bottom, if circumvented by  the projecting stones, they will usually abandon their work. Plank of  hard wood, or hard burnt bricks, may answer this purpose when stone  cannot be had.    All cellar walls should be laid in good lime mortar, or if that be not  practicable, they should be well pointed with it. This keeps them in  place, and renders them less liable to the ingress of water and vermin.  The thickness of wall should not be less than fifteen to eighteen  inches, in any event, when of stone; and if the house walls above be  built of stone or brick, two feet is better; and in all cases the cellar  wall should be full three inches thicker than the wall resting upon it.    In the cellar of every farm house there should be an outside door, with  a flight of steps by which to pass roots and other bulky or heavy  articles, to which a wagon or cart may approach, either to receive or  discharge them. This is indispensable.    Every out-building upon the farm, let it be devoted to what purpose it  may, having a wooden floor on the ground story, should be set up  sufficiently high from the surface to admit a cat or small terrier dog  beneath such floor, with openings for them to pass in and out, or these  hiding places will become so many rat warrens upon the premises, and  prove most destructive to the grain and poultry. Nothing can be more  annoying to the farmer than these vermin, and a trifling outlay in the  beginning, will exclude them from the foundations and walls of all  buildings. Care, therefore, should be taken to leave no haunt for their  convenience.    With these suggestions the ingenuity of every builder will provide  sufficient guards against the protection of vermin beneath his  buildings.          VENTILATION OF HOUSES.      Pure air, and enough of it, is the cheapest blessing one can enjoy; and  to deny one's self so indispensable an element of good health, is little  short of criminal neglect, or the sheerest folly. Yet thousands who  build at much needless expense, for the protection of their health and  that of their families, as they allege, and no doubt suppose, by  neglecting the simplest of all contrivances, in the work of ventilation,  invite disease and infirmity, from the very pains they so unwittingly  take to ward off such afflictions.    A man, be he farmer or of other profession, finding himself prosperous  in life, sets about the very sensible business of building a house for  his own accommodation. Looking back, perhaps, to the days of his  boyhood, in a severe climate, he remembers the not very highly-finished  tenement of his father, and the wide, open fireplace which, with its  well piled logs, was scarcely able to warm the large living-room, where  the family were wont to huddle in winter. He possibly remembers, with  shivering sympathy, the sprinkling of snow which he was accustomed to  find upon his bed as he awaked in the morning, that had found its way  through the frail casing of his chamber window--but in the midst of all  which he grew up with a vigorous constitution, a strong arm, and a  determined spirit. He is resolved that _his_ children shall encounter no  such hardships, and that himself and his excellent helpmate shall suffer  no such inconvenience as his own parents had done, who now perhaps, are  enjoying a strong and serene old age, in their old-fashioned, yet to  them not uncomfortable tenement. He therefore determines to have a snug,  _close_ house, where the cold cannot penetrate. He employs all his  ingenuity to make every joint an air-tight fit; the doors must swing to  an air-tight joint; the windows set into air-tight frames; and to  perfect the catalogue of his comforts, an air-tight stove is introduced  into every occupied room which, perchance, if he can afford it, are  further warmed and poisoned by the heated flues of an air-tight furnace  in his air-tight cellar. In short, it is an air-tight concern  throughout. His family breathe an air-tight atmosphere; they eat their  food cooked in an \"air-tight kitchen witch,\" of the latest \"premium  pattern;\" and thus they start, father, mother, children, all on the high  road--if persisted in--to a galloping consumption, which sooner or later  conducts them to an air-tight dwelling, not soon to be changed. If such  melancholy catastrophe be avoided, colds, catarrhs, headaches, and all  sorts of bodily afflictions shortly make their appearance, and they  wonder what is the matter! They live so snug! their house is so warm!  they sleep so comfortable! how can it be? True, in the morning the air  of their sleeping-rooms feels close, but then if a window is opened it  will chill the rooms, and that will give them colds. What _can_ be the  matter? The poor creatures never dream that they have been breathing,  for hour after hour, decomposed air, charged with poisonous gases, which  cannot escape through the tight walls, or over the tight windows, or  through the tight stoves; and thus they keep on in the sure course to  infirmity, disease, and premature death--all for the want of a little  ventilation! Better indeed, that instead of all this painstaking, a pane  were knocked out of every window, or a panel out of every door in the  house.    We are not disposed to talk about cellar furnaces for heating a farmer's  house. They have little to do in the farmer's inventory of goods at all,  unless it be to give warmth to the hall--and even then a snug box stove,  with its pipe passing into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#9)"],[1," he died, his dominions reached from the Tigris  to the Indus.  Abbas distinguished himself, not only by his  successes in arms, and by the magnificence of his court and  of the buildings which he erected, but also by his reforms in  the administration of his kingdom.  He encouraged commerce,  and, by constructing highways and building bridges, did much  to facilitate it.  To foreigners, especially Christians, he  showed a spirit of tolerance; two Englishmen, Sir Anthony  and Sir Robert Shirley, or Sherley, were admitted to his  confidence.  His fame is tarnished, however, by numerous deeds  of tyranny and cruelty.  His own family, especially, suffered  from his fits of jealousy; his eldest son was slain, and  the eyes of his other children were put out, by his orders.    See The Three Brothers, or Travels of Sir Anthony, Sir  Robert Sherley, &c. (London, 1823); Sir C. R. Markham,  General Sketch of the History of Persia (London, 1874).    ABBASIDS, the name generally given to the caliphs of Bagdad,  the second of the two great dynasties of the Mahommedan  empire.  The Abbasid caliphs officially based their claim  to the throne on their descent from Abbas (A.D. 566-652),  the eldest uncle of Mahomet, in virtue of which descent they  regarded themselves as the rightful heirs of the Prophet as  opposed to the Omayyads, the descendants of Omayya.  Throughout  the second period of the Omayyads, representatives of this  family were among their most dangerous opponents, partly by  the skill with which they undermined the reputation of the  reigning princes by accusations against their orthodoxy,  their moral character and their administration in general,  and partly by their cunning manipulation of internecine  jealousies among the Arabic and non-Arabic subjects of the  empire.  In the reign of Merwan II. this opposition culminated  in the rebellion of Ibrahim the Imam, the fourth in descent  from Abbas, who, supported hy the province of Khorasan, achieved  considerable successes, but was captured (A.D. 747) and died  in prison (as some hold, assassinated).  The quarrel was taken  up by his brother Abdallah, known by the name of Abu'l-Abbas  as-Saffah, who after a decisive victory on the Greater Zab  (750) finally crushed the Omayyads and was proclaimed caliph.    The history of the new dynasty is marked by perpetual  strife and the development of luxury and the liberal arts,  in place of the old-fashioned austerity of thought and  manners.  Mansur, the second of the house, who transferred  the seat of government to Bagdad, fought successfully against  the peoples of Asia Minor, and the reigns of Harun al-Rashid  (786--809) and Mamun (813-833) were periods of extraordinary  splendour.  But the empire as a whole stagnated and then decayed  rapidly.  Independent monarchs established themselves in  Africa and Khorasan (Spain had remained Omayyad throughout),  and in the north-west the Greeks successfully encroached.  The ruin of the dynasty came, however, from those Turkish  slaves who were constituted as a royal bodyguard by Moqtasim  (833-842).  Their power steadily grew until Radi (934-941) was  constrained to hand over most of the royal functions to Mahommed  b.  Raik.  Province after province renounced the authority  of the caliphs, who were merely lay figures, and finally  Hulagu, the Mongol chief, burned Bagdad (Feb. 28th, 1258).  The Abbasids still maintained a feeble show of authority,  confined to religious matters, in Egypt under the Mamelukes,  but the dynasty finally disappeared with Motawakkil III., who  was carried away as a prisoner to Constantinople by Selim I.    See CALIPHATE (Sections B, 14 and C), where a  detailed account of the dynasty will be found.    ABBAS MIRZA (c. 1783-1833), prince of Persia, was a  younger son of the shah, Feth Ali, but on account of his  mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed  him.  Entrusted with the government of a part of Persia, he  sought to rule it in European fashion, and employed officers  to reorganize his army.  He was soon at war with Russia, and  his aid was eagerly solicited by both England and Napoleon,  anxious to checkmate one another in the East.  Preferring  the friendship of France, Abbas continued the war against  Russia, but his new ally could give him very little assistance,  and in 1814 Persia was compelled to make a disadvantageous  peace.  He gained some successes during a war between Turkey  and Persia which broke out in 1821, but cholera attacked his  army, and a treaty was signed in 1823.  His second war with  Russia, which began in 1825, was attended with the same want of  success as the former one, and Persia was forced to cede some  territory.  When peace was made in 1828 Abbas then sought  to restore order in the province of Khorasan, which was  nominally under Persian supremacy, and while engaged in the  task died at Meshed in 1833.  In 1834 his eldest son, Mahommed  Mirza, succeeded Feth Ali as shah.  Abbas was an intelligent  prince, possessed some literary taste, and it noteworthy  on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.    ABBAS-TUMAN, a spa in Russian Transcaucasia, government of  Tiflis, 50 m.  S.W. of the Borzhom railway station and 65  m.  E. of Batum, very picturesquely situated in a cauldron-shaped  valley.  It has hot sulphur baths (93 1/2 deg. -118 1/2 deg.  Fahr.) and an astronomical observatory (4240 ft.).    ABBAZIA, a popular summer and winter resort of Austria, in  Istria, 56 m.  S.E. of Trieste by rail.  Pop. (1900) 2343.  It  is situated on the Gulf of Quarnero in a sheltered position at  the foot of the Monte Maggiore (4580 ft.), and is surrounded  by beautiiul woods of laurel.  The average temperature is 50 deg.  Fahr. in winter, and 77 deg.  Fahr. in summer.  The old abbey,  San Giacomo della Priluca, from which the place derives its  name, has been converted into a villa.  Abbazia is frequented  annually by about 16,000 visitors.  The whole sea-coast to  the north and south of Abbazia is rocky and picturesque,  and contains several smaller winter-resorts.  The largest  of them is Lovrana (pop. 513), situated 5 m. to the south.    ABBESS (Lat. abbatissa, fem. form of abbas, abbot),  the female superior of an abbey or convent of nuns.  The  mode of election, position, rights and authority of an abbess  correspond generally with those of an abbot (q.v.). The  office is elective, the choice being by the secret votes of the  sisters from their own body.  The abbess is solemnly admitted  to her office by episcopal benediction, together with the  conferring of a staff and pectoral cross, and holds for life,  though liable to be deprived for misconduct.  The council of  Trent fixed the qualifying age at forty, with eight years of  profession.  Abbesses have a right to demand absolute obedience  of their nuns, over whom they exercise discipline, extending  even to the power of expulsion, subject, however, to the  bishop.  As a female an abbess is incapable of performing the  spiritual functions of the priesthood belonging to an abbot.  She cannot ordain, confer the veil, nor excommunicate.  In  England abbesses attended ecclesiastical councils, e.g. that  of Becanfield in 694, where they signed before the presbyters.    By Celtic usage abbesses presided over joint-houses of monks and  nuns.  This custom accompanied Celtic monastic missions to France  and Spain, and even to Rome itself.  At a later period, A.D.  1115, Robert, the founder of Fontevraud, committed the government  of the whole order, men as well as women, to a female superior.    In the German Evangelical church the title of abbess (Aebtissin)  has in some cases--e.g. Itzehoe--survived to designate the  heads of abbeys which since the Reformation have continued as  Stifte, i.e. collegiate foundations, which provide a home  and an income for unmarried ladies, generally of noble birth,  called canonesses (Kanonissinen) or more usually Stiftsdamen.  This office of abbess is of considerable social dignity, and  is sometimes filled by princesses of the reigning houses.    ABBEVILLE, a town of northern France, capital of an  arrondissement in the department of Somme, on the Somme, 12  m. from its mouth in the English Channel, and 28 m.  N,W. of  Amiens on the Northern railway.  Pop. (1901) 18,519; (1906)  18,971.  It lies in a pleasant and fertile valley, and is  built partly on an island and partly on both sides of the  river, which is canalized from this point to the estuary.  The  streets are narrow, and the houses are mostly picturesque old  structures, built of wood, with many quaint gables and dark  archways.  The most remarkable building is the church of St  Vulfran, erected in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.  The  original design was not completed.  The nave has only two bays  and the choir is insignificant.  The facade is a magnificent  specimen of the flamboyant Gothic style, flanked by two Gothic  towers.  Abbeville has several other old churches and an  hotel-de-ville, with a belfry of the 13th century.  Among  the numerous old houses, that known as the Maison de Francois  Ie, which is the most remarkable, dates from the 16th century.  There is a statue of Admiral Courbet (d. 1885) in the chief  square.  The public institutions include tribunals of first instance  and of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, and a communal  college.  Abbeville is an important industrial centre; in addition  to its old-established manufacture of cloth, hemp-spinning,  sugar-making, ship-building and locksmiths' work are carried on;  there is active commerce in grain, but the port has little trade.    Abbeville, the chief town of the district of Ponthieu, first  appears in history during the 9th century.  At that time  belonging to the abbey of St Riquier, it was afterwards  governed by the counts of Ponthieu.  Together with that county,  it came into the possession of the Alencon and other French  families, and afterwards into that of "]]]
