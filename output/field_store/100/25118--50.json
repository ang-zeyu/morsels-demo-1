The Blessed Virgin beyond all others, affords us an example of the same  faith, in that she was purified according to the law of Moses, and like  all other women, though she was bound by no such law and had no need  of purification. Still she submitted to the law voluntarily and of free  love, making herself like the rest of women, that she might not offend  or throw contempt on them. She was not justified by doing this; but,  being already justified, she did it freely and gratuitously. Thus ought  our works too to be done, and not in order to be justified by them; for,  being first justified by faith, we ought to do all our works freely and  cheerfully for the sake of others.    St. Paul circumcised his disciple Timothy, not because he needed  circumcision for his justification, but that he might not offend or  contemn those Jews, weak in the faith, who had not yet been able to  comprehend the liberty of faith. On the other hand, when they contemned  liberty and urged that circumcision was necessary for justification, he  resisted them, and would not allow Titus to be circumcised. For, as he  would not offend or contemn any one's weakness in faith, but yielded  for the time to their will, so, again, he would not have the liberty of  faith offended or contemned by hardened self-justifiers, but walked in  a middle path, sparing the weak for the time, and always resisting the  hardened, that he might convert all to the liberty of faith. On the same  principle we ought to act, receiving those that are weak in the faith,  but boldly resisting these hardened teachers of works, of whom we shall  hereafter speak at more length.    Christ also, when His disciples were asked for the tribute money, asked  of Peter whether the children of a king were not free from taxes. Peter  agreed to this; yet Jesus commanded him to go to the sea, saying, \"Lest  we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up  the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth thou  shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for Me and  thee\" (Matt. xvii. 27).    This example is very much to our purpose; for here Christ calls Himself  and His disciples free men and children of a King, in want of nothing;  and yet He voluntarily submits and pays the tax. Just as far, then,  as this work was necessary or useful to Christ for justification or  salvation, so far do all His other works or those of His disciples avail  for justification. They are really free and subsequent to justification,  and only done to serve others and set them an example.    Such are the works which Paul inculcated, that Christians should be  subject to principalities and powers and ready to every good work (Titus  iii. 1), not that they may be justified by these things--for they are  already justified by faith--but that in liberty of spirit they may thus  be the servants of others and subject to powers, obeying their will out  of gratuitous love.    Such, too, ought to have been the works of all colleges, monasteries,  and priests; every one doing the works of his own profession and state  of life, not in order to be justified by them, but in order to bring his  own body into subjection, as an example to others, who themselves  also need to keep under their bodies, and also in order to accommodate  himself to the will of others, out of free love. But we must always  guard most carefully against any vain confidence or presumption of being  justified, gaining merit, or being saved by these works, this being the  part of faith alone, as I have so often said.    Any man possessing this knowledge may easily keep clear of danger among  those innumerable commands and precepts of the Pope, of bishops, of  monasteries, of churches, of princes, and of magistrates, which some  foolish pastors urge on us as being necessary for justification and  salvation, calling them precepts of the Church, when they are not so  at all. For the Christian freeman will speak thus: I will fast, I will  pray, I will do this or that which is commanded me by men, not as having  any need of these things for justification or salvation, but that I  may thus comply with the will of the Pope, of the bishop, of such a  community or such a magistrate, or of my neighbour as an example to him;  for this cause I will do and suffer all things, just as Christ did and  suffered much more for me, though He needed not at all to do so on His  own account, and made Himself for my sake under the law, when He was  not under the law. And although tyrants may do me violence or wrong in  requiring obedience to these things, yet it will not hurt me to do them,  so long as they are not done against God.    From all this every man will be able to attain a sure judgment and  faithful discrimination between all works and laws, and to know who  are blind and foolish pastors, and who are true and good ones. For  whatsoever work is not directed to the sole end either of keeping under  the body, or of doing service to our neighbour--provided he require  nothing contrary to the will of God--is no good or Christian work. Hence  I greatly fear that at this day few or no colleges, monasteries, altars,  or ecclesiastical functions are Christian ones; and the same may be said  of fasts and special prayers to certain saints. I fear that in all these  nothing is being sought but what is already ours; while we fancy that  by these things our sins are purged away and salvation is attained, and  thus utterly do away with Christian liberty. This comes from ignorance  of Christian faith and liberty.    This ignorance and this crushing of liberty are diligently promoted by  the teaching of very many blind pastors, who stir up and urge the people  to a zeal for these things, praising them and puffing them up with their  indulgences, but never teaching faith. Now I would advise you, if you  have any wish to pray, to fast, or to make foundations in churches, as  they call it, to take care not to do so with the object of gaining any  advantage, either temporal or eternal. You will thus wrong your faith,  which alone bestows all things on you, and the increase of which, either  by working or by suffering, is alone to be cared for. What you give,  give freely and without price, that others may prosper and have increase  from you and your goodness. Thus you will be a truly good man and a  Christian. For what to you are your goods and your works, which are done  over and above for the subjection of the body, since you have abundance  for yourself through your faith, in which God has given you all things?    We give this rule: the good things which we have from God ought to flow  from one to another and become common to all, so that every one of us  may, as it were, put on his neighbour, and so behave towards him as if  he were himself in his place. They flowed and do flow from Christ to us;  He put us on, and acted for us as if He Himself were what we are.  From us they flow to those who have need of them; so that my faith  and righteousness ought to be laid down before God as a covering and  intercession for the sins of my neighbour, which I am to take on myself,  and so labour and endure servitude in them, as if they were my own; for  thus has Christ done for us. This is true love and the genuine truth  of Christian life. But only there is it true and genuine where there  is true and genuine faith. Hence the Apostle attributes to charity this  quality: that she seeketh not her own.    We conclude therefore that a Christian man does not live in himself, but  in Christ and in his neighbour, or else is no Christian: in Christ by  faith; in his neighbour by love. By faith he is carried upwards  above himself to God, and by love he sinks back below himself to his  neighbour, still always-abiding in God and His love, as Christ says,  \"Verily I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the  angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man\" (John i.  51).    Thus much concerning liberty, which, as you see, is a true and spiritual  liberty, making our hearts free from all sins, laws, and commandments,  as Paul says, \"The law is not made for a righteous man\" (1 Tim. i. 9),  and one which surpasses all other external liberties, as far as heaven  is above earth. May Christ make us to understand and preserve this  liberty. Amen.    Finally, for the sake of those to whom nothing can be stated so well but  that they misunderstand and distort it, we must add a word, in case they  can understand even that. There are very many persons who, when they  hear of this liberty of faith, straightway turn it into an occasion of  licence. They think that everything is now lawful for them, and do not  choose to show themselves free men and Christians in any other way than  by their contempt and reprehension of ceremonies, of traditions, of  human laws; as if they were Christians merely because they refuse  to fast on stated days, or eat flesh when others fast, or omit the  customary prayers; scoffing at the precepts of men, but utterly passing  over all the rest that belongs to the Christian religion. On the other  hand, they are most pertinaciously resisted by those who strive after  salvation solely by their observance of and reverence for ceremonies,  as if they would be saved merely because they fast on stated days,  or abstain from flesh, or make formal prayers; talking loudly of the  precepts of the Church and of the Fathers, and not caring a straw about  those things which belong to our genuine faith. Both these parties  are plainly culpable, in that, while they neglect matters which are of  weight and necessary for salvation, they contend noisily about such as  are without weight and not necessary.    How much more rightly does the Apostle Paul teach us to walk in the  middle path, condemning either extreme and saying, \"Let not him that  eateth despise him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#9)"],[1,"in the third century.  Seeck added the suggestion that these regiments remained in garrison  till 383, when Maximus marched them off to the continent. According to  him, the garrison of the Wall through the first eighty years of the  fourth century was much the same as it had been in the third century,  with certain changes and additions. Mr. Craster holds a different view.  He thinks that most of the troops named in these chapters were due to  Stilicho's reorganization in 395-9, but that one section, headed 'per  lineam valli', records troops who had been in Britain in the third  century and had been destroyed before 369. I cannot feel that he has  proved his case. One would have thought that, when the compiler of the  Notitia in 425 wanted to fill the gap left by the loss of the Wall, he  would have gone back to the last garrison of the Wall, that is, on Mr.  Craster's view, the garrison of 369-83, not to arrangements which had  vanished some years earlier. But the problems of this obscure period are  not to be solved without many attacks. We must be glad that Mr. Craster  has delivered a serious attack; even if he has not succeeded, his  scholarly discussion may make things easier for the next assailants.    (3) The _Antiquary_ for 1914 contains an attempt by Mr. W. J. Kaye  to catalogue all the examples of triple vases of Roman date found in  Britain. It also prints a note by myself (p. 439) on the topography of  the campaign of Suetonius against Boudicca, which argues that the defeat  of the British warrior queen occurred somewhere on Watling Street  between Chester (or Wroxeter) and London.    [Illustration: FIG. 18. TILE GRAVES IN THE INFIRMARY FIELD, CHESTER]    (4) In the _Sitzungsberichte der kgl. preuss. Akademie_ (1914, p. 635),  prof. Kuno Meyer, late of Liverpool, argues that the Celtic name of St.  Patrick, commonly spelt Sucat and explained as akin to Celtic words  meaning 'brave in war' (stem _su_-, 'good'), ought to be really spelt  Succet and connected with Gaulish names like Succius and Sucelus. This,  he thinks, destroys the last remnant of a reason for Zimmer's idea that  Patrick was the same as Palladius.      2. SPECIAL SITES OR DISTRICTS      _Berks_    (5) Some notes of traces, near Kintbury west of Speen (Spinae), of the  Roman road from Silchester to Bath are given by Mr. O. G. S. Crawford in  the _Berks, Bucks, and Oxon Archaeological Journal_ for Oct. 1914  (xx. 96).      _Cheshire_    [Illustration: FIG. 17. GRAVES IN THE INFIRMARY FIELD, CHESTER]    (6) In _Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology_ (Liverpool, 1914,  vol. vi, pp. 121-67) Prof. Newstead describes and illustrates fully  the thirty-five graves found in 1912-3 in the Infirmary Field, Chester,  of which I gave a brief account in my Report for 1913 (p. 14). Save  for a few first-century remains in one corner, the graveyard seems to  be an inhumation cemetery, used during the second half of the second  century--rather an early date for such a cemetery. I do not myself feel  much doubt that some at least of the tombstones extracted in 1890-2  from the western half of the North City Wall were taken from this area.  They belong to the first and second centuries and suggest (as I pointed  out when they were found) that the Wall was built about A.D. 200. That,  however, is just the date when the cemetery was closed; the seizure  of the tombstones for the construction of the Wall would explain why  the Infirmary Field has yielded no tombstones from all its graves.  By the kindness of Professors Bosanquet and Newstead I can add some  illustrations of the graves themselves, from blocks used for Prof.  Newstead's paper. Fig. 17 shows two of the simpler graves, fig. 18, two  built with tiles. Fig. 19 illustrates some curious nails found with the  bodies.      _Derbyshire_    (7) A list of the place-names of Derbyshire with philological notes is  commenced by Mr. B. Walker, sometime of Liverpool University, in the  _Proceedings of the Derbyshire Archaeological and Natural History  Society_ for 1913 (xxxvi. 123-284, Derby, 1914); it is to be completed  in a future volume. I venture two suggestions. First, like, many similar  treatises on place-names which are now being issued, this work has too  limited a scope. It deals mainly with certain names of modern towns and  villages; it takes little or no heed of ancient names of houses and  fields or of lanes and roads (as Bathamgate, Doctorgate), or of rivers  (as Noe), or (lastly) of the place-names of the older England which are  preserved only in charters, chronicles, and the like; unless they chance  to come among the select list of modern names which the writer chooses  to admit, they find no notice. Yet it is the older names of all sorts,  irrespective of their survival in prominent fashion to-day, with which  historical students and even philologists are most really concerned.  Secondly, writers on place-names take too little account of facts  outside the phonetic horizon. In the present instalment of Derbyshire,  the one Roman item noted is Derby. Here, in the suburb of Little  Chester, was a Roman fort or village, and past it flows the river then  and now called Derwent or something similar. Yet the etymology of Derby  is discussed without any reference to the river name. No doubt Derby is  not derived by regular phonetic process from Derwent; its earliest  spellings, Deoraby and the like, connect it with either the word for  'wild beast' or the proper name Deor. Still, it is incredible that the  Derwent should flow past Derby and the adjacent Darley (formerly Derley)  and be unrelated. One may guess with little rashness that the invaders  who renamed the site took over the Romano-British name (Deruentio or the  like) and reshaped that after analogies of their own speech. Does not a  form Deorwenta occur (though Mr. Walker has missed it) to show that the  two names interacted? Again, Chesterfield (Cesterfelda, A.D. 955) is  glossed as 'the field by the fort'. What fort? There is none, nor does  'Chester' necessarily mean that there was. Etymologizing without  reference to facts is wasted work.    [Illustration: FIG. 19. NAILS FROM THE CHESTER GRAVES. (p. 42)]    [Illustration: FIG. 20. THE MERSEA GRAVE MOUND. (p. 43)]    [Illustration: FIG. 21. LEADEN CASKET AND GLASS SEPULCHRAL VESSEL FROM  THE MERSEA BURIAL-MOUND. (p. 43)]      _Dorset_    (8) In the _Numismatic Chronicle_ for 1914 (pp. 92-5), Mr. H. Symonds  lists 107 'third brass' from a hoard found (it seems) about 1850 near  Puncknoll. They consist of 3 Gallienus, 2 Salonina, 55 Postumus, 40  Victorinus, 3 Tetricus, 1 Tetricus junior, 2 Claudius Gothicus, and 1  Garausius. The hoard was, then, of a familiar type; its original size  we cannot guess. A brief reference to the same hoard occurs in the  _Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club_  (xxxv, p. li).    (9) The latter periodical (pp. 88, 118) also contains Mr. H. Gray's  Fifth Report on the gradual exploration of the Roman amphitheatre and  the underlying prehistoric remains at Maumbury Rings, Dorchester--now  substantially concluded--and an interesting little note on the New  Forest pottery-works by Mr. Sumner (p. xxxii).      _Essex_    [Illustration: FIG. 22. RESTORATION OF THE TILE-BUILT GRAVE-CHAMBER OF  THE MERSEA MOUND]    (10) By the kindness of the Morant Club and the Essex Archaeological  Society, I am able to reproduce here three illustrations of the finds in  the Mersea Mound, which I mentioned in my Report for 1913 (p. 42). Figs.  20, 22 show a view of the actual tomb; fig. 21 shows the chief contents.  The interest of these half-native, half-Roman grave-mounds, which occur  in eastern Britain and in the Low Countries opposite, will justify their  insertion here. I may also correct an error in my account. No 'Samian  stamped VITALIS' was found at Mersea, but objects which have been  elsewhere found in association with that stamp.    (11) Two small Essex excavations are recorded in the _Transactions of  the Essex Archaeological Society_, vol. xiii. At Chadwell St. Mary,  near Tilbury, Mr. Miller Christy and Mr. F. W. Reader explored an  early-looking mound, only to find that it was probably mediaeval (pp.  218-33). At Hockley, also in South Essex, the same archaeologists with  Mr. E. B. Francis dug into a similar mound and met with many potsherds  of Roman date and a coin of Domitian; no trace of a burial was detected,  such as has come to light in other Romano-British mounds at Mersea,  Bartlow, and elsewhere (_ibid._, p. 224). Indeed, it does not seem quite  clear that the mound was thrown up in Roman times; it may have been  reared later, with earth which contained Romano-British objects.      _Gloucester_    (12) The _Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological  Society_ (vol. xxxvi) refers to excavations at Sea Mills, on the King's  Weston estate, in February 1913; the finds appear not to have been  extensive. They also record the transfer of the Roman 'villa' at  Witcombe to the care of H.M. Office of Works by the owner, Mr. W. F.  Hicks-Beach.      _Hants_    (13) Mr. Heywood Sumner's pamphlet _Excavations on Rockbourne Down_  (London, 1914, p. 43) is a readable, scholarly, and well-illustrated  account of a Romano-British farm-site five miles south-west of Salisbury  on the edge of Cranborne Chase. Mr. Sumner excavated parts of it in  1911-13; his account appeared so early in 1914 that it found a place in  my Report for 1913 (pp. 23-5).    (14) Some Roman roads in Hampshire are treated in the _Papers and  Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club and Archaeological Society_  (vii, part 1). Capt. G. A. Kempthorne writes on the road east and west  of Silchester and Mr. Karslake adds a word as to the line outside the  west gate of that town, which he puts north of the generally assumed  line (p. 25). Mr. O. G. S. Crawford and Mr. J. P. Freeman-Williams deal  with very much more uncertain roads in the"]]]
