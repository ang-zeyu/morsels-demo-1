In the triforium over, as previously noted in description of exterior,  the side walls were raised, the original Norman windows blocked up and  Perpendicular ones placed over, the roof being at the same time raised  on the outside to the necessary height, and made of a shallower pitch;  this is clearly noticeable from the triforium walks.    In the easternmost bays, two windows were raised still more to gain  additional light for the choir.    In the seventh bay from the west end occurs the door once leading to the  _green yard_.    [Illustration: The North Aisle of Nave, looking West.]    #The South Aisle of Nave# corresponds with the north, and is covered  with a plain quadri-partite vault, with the exception of the seventh and  eighth bays from the west; these were converted by Bishop Nykke into a  chapel enclosed by screens, and are marked on the plan as E.E. The  Norman vaults were here removed and the late Perpendicular ones  constructed in their stead; the windows appear to be of still later  date, but are supposed to have been, and most probably were, inserted at  this period.    #Monuments in Nave.#--The nave suffered severely at the hands of the  Puritans, who destroyed many of the early tombs and effigies. Especially  noticeable is the lack of brasses; all these have disappeared, with the  exception only of one in the Jesus Chapel. Another singularity is that  the burial-place of most of the bishops who are known to have been  interred in the cathedral is quite uncertain. The best of them seem to  have been content with a plain slab and inscribed brass; only Nykke, of  infamous memory, left so gorgeous a chapel behind to perpetuate it.    Bishop Hall, in his \"Hard Measure,\" gives a sketch of vivid historical  interest of the sacrilege committed during the Puritan rebellion, and  when, in 1643, the cathedral was in the possession of the fanatics.  \"Lord, what work was here, what clattering of glasses, what beating down  of Walls, what tearing up of Monuments, what pulling down of Seates,  what wresting out of Irons and Brass from the Windows and Graves. What  defacing of Armes, what demolishing of curious stone work, that had not  any representation in the World, but only of the cost of the Founder and  skill of the Mason, what toting and piping upon the destroyed Organ  pipes, and what a hideous triumph on the Market day before all the  Countrey, when, in a kind of Sacrilegious and profane procession, all  the Organ pipes, Vestments, both Copes and Surplices, together with the  Leaden Crosse which had been newly sawne down from over the Green-Yard  Pulpit, and the Service books and singing books that could be had, were  carried to the fire in the publick Market place; A leud wretch walking  before the Train, in his Cope trailing in the dirt, with a Service book  in his hand, imitating in an impious scorne the tune, and usurping the  words of the Letany; neer the Publick Crosse, all these monuments of  Idolatry must be sacrificed to the fire, not without much Ostentation of  a zealous joy.\"    #Monuments in North Aisle of Nave.#--In the fifth bay of the nave arcade  (marked I on plan) is the altar tomb of Sir Thomas Wyndham and his four  wives. This was originally in the Lady Chapel, then, for a time, the  Jesus Chapel, and about 1869 moved to its present position.    Between the sixth and seventh bay is buried Dean Prideaux (d. 1724). The  ninth bay of aisle is lighted by a memorial window to William Smith (d.  1849), Professor of Modern History at Cambridge. In the tenth bay  (marked 2 on plan) is the altar tomb, with panelled sides, to Sir John  Hobart (d. 1507), Attorney-General to Henry VII.    #Monuments in South Aisle of Nave# from the west.--In the sixth bay is a  memorial window by Wailes to members of the Hales family. In the seventh  bay (marked 3 on plan) is the tomb of Chancellor Spencer; the rents of  the dean and chapter were formerly paid here. The ninth bay (marked 4 on  plan) contains the altar tomb of Bishop Parkhurst (1560-74).    [Illustration: The East Walk of the Cloisters.]    #The Cloisters# and destroyed monastic buildings.--The cloisters are  on the south side of the cathedral, the interior garth being about 145  feet square.    [Illustration: The Cloisters from the Garth.]    The original Norman cloisters, which were probably of a wooden  construction, were destroyed by the fire of 1272; and the work of  building the present cloisters was commenced by Bishop Walpole (1289-99)  about 1297, but they were not completely finished until 1430, in the  time of Bishop Alnwyck (1426-36). They present an interesting, and, at  the same time, complex study of the development of the styles during the  one hundred and thirty-three years which passed during their erection; a  paper by the Rev. D.J. Stewart (published in vol. 32 of the  _Archaeological Journal_) goes minutely into their construction, and the  several parts the various bishops of Norwich played in their design.  Those who wish to study this part of the cathedral thoroughly cannot do  better than refer to this paper.    It will be noticed that, despite the lengthy period occupied in the  construction of the cloisters, the result is in no way inharmonious; it  is only in the detail, and especially the open tracery to the bays, that  the difference of style is very perceptible.    Counting the angle severies as in each walk, it will be noticed that  there are fourteen severies on the east side; and thirteen on the other  three. Each is nearly square on plan, and vaulted over with horizontal  longitudinal and transverse ribs, between which occur diagonals and  _tiercerons_; with carved bosses at the intersections. The piers  carrying the vaults consist of groups of separate cylindrical shafts of  Purbeck marble.    On the three sides--east, west, and south--there are separate storeys of  apartments over the vaults, which were used for various purposes by the  monks.    In elevation--and of course this can best be seen from the Garth--each  bay is divided by a projecting buttress with diagonal one in the angles;  the arches are filled with open tracery carried by two mullions; it is  this tracery which marks most clearly the various changes of style. The  shape of the arch is similar throughout. This was a concession on the  part of the later builders which ensured harmony in the whole; but on  each side the tracery is varied. On the east side it is geometrical in  character, the work being transitional between Early English and  Decorated; on the south side the tracery is more flowing and has  advanced to Decorated; on the west side again, we get the transitional  style between Decorated and Perpendicular, with some _flamboyant_ or  flame-like detail; while on the north and latest side it is frankly  Perpendicular.    #The East Walk# of cloisters is the earliest; access to which is gained  from the south aisle of nave of cathedral, through the #Prior's Door#;  of this fine specimen of early Decorated work we give an illustration.  In the sixth bay, from, and counting the angle, may be seen the  walled-up entrance to the Slype. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth bays  remain the arches which once gave entrance to the chapter-house; these  were walled up until about 1850.    According to the itinerary of William of Worcester, the chapter-house,  which was built by Bishop Walpole (1289-99), projected eastward about 80  feet, terminating with a polygonal apse, as shown by the dotted lines to  our plan.    The prolongation of this east walk southwards beyond the south walk of  the cloisters, led formerly to the infirmary; of which now only remain  the three piers in the lower close; the greater part having been pulled  down in 1804. During some time in the eighteenth century the infirmary  was used as a workhouse.    The dormitories in all monasteries were connected with one of the  transepts, usually the south, so that the monks could at all hours  easily gain access to the cathedral for the performance of the offices  of their order; it is probable, therefore, that the rooms over this east  walk of the cloisters here at Norwich may have been used as dormitories,  with a staircase on the western side of the south transept leading to  them. The dormitories are supposed by some antiquarians to have been  placed south of the destroyed chapter-house; the door in the twelfth bay  of the east wall of the cloisters (marked 5 on plan) probably giving  rise to the supposition.    The sculptured vault-bosses in this walk are illustrative of incidents  in Gospel story and of the legends of the four evangelists.    #The South Walk#, the south wall of which was also the wall of the  refectory. A door (marked 6 on plan) at the western end of this walk led  to the refectory. To the west were probably the kitchen and offices. The  sculptured bosses of the vault over this walk are illustrations of  scenes from the Book of Revelation.    [Illustration: The Prior's Door.]    #The West Walk.#--In the first two bays (marked 7 on plan) are the  lavatories of the monks; and in the fourth bay, a door (marked 8 on  plan) that formerly led to the guest hall, pulled down by Dean Gardiner,  1573-89. The cellarer whose duty it was to look after the guests  probably had apartments above.    A door in the last bay leads to the #Choir School#; this was formerly  the #Locutory#, where the monks indulged in their daily gossip. The  western wall is in the Early Decorated style; the body of the room  dating from Norman times.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],[0,"The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#9)"],[1," chief  exceptions are words in which the silent _e_ is retained to  preserve the soft sound of _c_ or _g_.    Rule 10.  Plurals are regularly formed by adding _s_; but if the  word end in a sibilant sound (_sh, zh, z, s, j, ch, x_), the plural  is formed by adding _es,_ which is pronounced as a separate syllable.  If the word end{s} in a sibilant sound followed by silent _e,_  that _e_ unites with the _s_ to form a separate syllable.  Examples: _seas, cans; boxes, churches, brushes; changes, services_.    Rule 11.  Final _y_ is regularly changed to _i_ when a syllable is  added.  In plurals it is changed to _ies,_ except when preceded by a  vowel, when a simple _s_ is added without change of the _y_.  Examples: _clumsy, clumsily_; _city, cities_; _chimney, chimneys_.  We have _colloquies_ because _u_ after _q_ has the value of the  consonant _w_.  There are a few exceptions to the above rule.  When two  _i_'s would come together, the _y_ is not changed, as in _carrying_.    Rule 12.  Words ending, in a double consonant commonly retain the double  consonant in derivatives.  The chief exception is _all,_ which drops one  _l,_ as in _almighty, already, although,_ etc.  According to English  usage other words ending in double _l_ drop one _l_ in derivatives,  and we have _skilful_ (for _skillful_), _wilful_ (for _willful_), etc.,  but Webster does not approve this custom.  _Ful_ is an affix,  not the word _full_ in a compound.      EXCEPTIONS AND IRREGULARITIES.    1.  Though in the case of simple words ending in a double consonant the  derivatives usually retain the double consonant, _pontific_ and  _pontifical_ (from _pontiff_) are exceptions, and when three letters of  the same kind would come together, one is usually dropped, as in  _agreed_ (_agree_ plus _ed_), _illy_ (_ill_ plus _ly_), _belless,_ etc.  We may write _bell-less,_ etc., however, in the case of words in which  three _l_'s come together, separating the syllables by a hyphen.    2.  To prevent two _i_'s coming together, we change _i_ to _y_ in  _dying, tying, vying,_ etc., from _die, tie,_ and _vie_.    3.  Derivatives from _adjectives_ ending in _y_ do not change _y_ to  _i_, and we have _shyly, shyness, slyly,_ etc., though _drier_ and  _driest_ from _dry_ are used.  The _y_ is not changed before _ship,_  as in _secretaryship, ladyship,_ etc., nor in _babyhood_ and _ladykin_.    4.  We have already seen that _y_ is not changed in derivatives when it  is preceded by another vowel, as in the case of _joyful,_ etc.;  but we find exceptions to this principle in _daily, laid, paid, said,  saith, slain,_ and _staid_; and many write _gaily_ and _gaiety,_  though Webster prefers _gayly_ and _gayety_.    5.  Nouns of one syllable ending in _o_ usually take a silent _e_ also,  as _toe, doe, shoe,_ etc, but other parts of speech do not take the _e,_  as _do, to, so, no,_ and the like, and nouns of more than one syllable,  as _potato, tomato,_ etc., omit the _e_.  Monosyllables ending in _oe_  usually retain the silent _e_ in derivatives, and we have _shoeing,  toeing,_ etc.  The commoner English nouns ending in _o_ also have the  peculiarity of forming the plural by adding _es_ instead of _s,_ and we  have _potatoes, tomatoes, heroes, echoes, cargoes, embargoes, mottoes_;  but nouns a trifle more foreign form their plurals regularly, as _solos,  zeros, pianos,_ etc.  When a vowel precedes the _o,_ the plural is  always formed regularly.  The third person singular of the verb _woo_  is _wooes,_ of _do does,_ of _go goes,_ etc., in analogy with the  plurals of the nouns ending in _o_.    6.  The following are exceptions to the rule that silent _e_ is retained  in derivatives when the added syllable begins with a consonant:  _judgment, acknowledgment, lodgment, wholly, abridgment, wisdom,_ etc.    7.  Some nouns ending in _f_ or _fe_ change those terminations to _ve_  in the plural, as _beef---beeves, leaf---leaves, knife---knives,  loaf---loaves, life---lives, wife---wives, thief---thieves,  wolf---wolves, self---selves, shelf---shelves, calf---calves,  half---halves, elf---elves, sheaf---sheaves_.  We have _chief---chiefs_  and _handkerchief---handkerchiefs,_ however, and the same is true of all  nouns ending in _f_ or _fe_ except those given above.    8.  A few nouns form their plurals by changing a single vowel, as  _man---men, woman---women, goose---geese, foot---feet, tooth---teeth,_  etc.  Compounds follow the rule of the simple form, but the plural of  _talisman_ is _talismans,_ of _German_ is _Germans,_ of _musselman_ is  _musselmans,_ because these are not compounds of _men_.    9.  A few plurals are formed by adding _en,_ as _brother---brethren,  child---children, ox---oxen_.    10.  _Brother, pea, die,_ and _penny_ have each two plurals, which  differ in meaning.  _Brothers_ refers to male children of the same  parents, _brethren_ to members of a religious body or the like;  _peas_ is used when a definite number is mentioned, _pease_ when  bulk is referred to; _dies_ are instruments used for stamping, etc.,  _dice_ cubical blocks used in games of chance; _pennies_ refer to a  given number of coins, _pence_ to an amount reckoned by the coins.  _Acquaintance_ is sometimes used in the plural for _acquaintances_ with  no difference of meaning.    11.  A few words are the same in the plural as in the singular,  as _sheep, deer, trout,_ etc.    12.  Some words derived from foreign languages retain the plurals of  those languages.  For example:  datum---data  criterion---criteria  genus---genera  larva---larvae=  crisis---crises  matrix---matrices  focus---foci  monsieur---messieurs    13.  A few allow either a regular plural or the plural retained  from the foreign language:  formula---formulae or formulas  beau---beaux or beaus  index---indices or indexes  stratum---strata or stratums  bandit---banditti or bandits  cherub---cherubim or cherubs  seraph---seraphim or seraphs    14.  In very loose compounds in which a noun is followed by an adjective  or the like, the noun commonly takes the plural ending, as in  _courts-martial, sons-in-law, cousins-german_.  When the adjective is  more closely joined, the plural ending must be placed at the end of the  entire word.  Thus we have _cupfuls, handfuls,_ etc.    Different Spellings for the same Sound.    Perhaps the greatest difficulty in spelling English words arises from  the fact that words and syllables pronounced alike are often spelled  differently, and there is no rule to guide us in distinguishing.  In order to fix their spelling, in mind we should know what classes of  words are doubtful, and when we come to them constantly refer to the  dictionary.  To try to master these except in the connections in which  we wish to use them the writer believes to be worse than folly.  By studying such words in pairs, confusion is very likely to be fixed  forever in the mind.  Most spelling-books commit this error, and so are  responsible for a considerable amount of bad spelling, which their  method has actually introduced and instilled into the child's mind.    Persons who read much are not likely to make these errors, since they  remember words by the form as it appeals to the eye, not by the sound  in which there is no distinction.  The study of such words should  therefore be conducted chiefly while writing or reading, not orally.    While we must memorize, one at a time as we come to them in reading or  writing, the words or syllables in which the same sound is represented  by different spellings, still we should know clearly what classes of  words to be on the lookout for.  We will now consider some of the  classes of words in which a single syllable may be spelled in various ways.
