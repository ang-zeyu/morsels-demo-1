Without any political experience  whatever, the people attempted to lay the foundation of a new system of  government and society. With head and hearts perverted by monkish  superstition and Spanish tyranny, yet set on fire by the French  Revolution, what did they know of liberty! Endless civil wars have  followed independence. \"Political ambition,\" says a late United States  minister, \"personal jealousies, impracticable theories, official  venality, reckless disregard of individual rights and legal obligations,  foolish meddling and empirical legislation, and an absolute want of  political morality, form the principal features of their republican  history.\"[20] To-day they tread on the dust of an ancient race whose  government was in every respect a most complete contrast to their own.    [Footnote 20: _Four Years among Spanish Americans, by Hon. F.  Hassaurek_: a truthful work, to which we refer the reader for details,  especially concerning Ecuadorian life and manners.]    At the foot of volcanic Pichincha, only five hours' travel from its  smoking crater, lies \"the city above the clouds,\" \"the navel of the  world,\" \"magnificent Quito.\" On the north is the plain of Rumibamba, the  battle-field where Gonzalo Pizarro routed the first viceroy of Peru, and  the scene, two centuries later, of the nobler achievements of La  Condamine, which made it the classic ground of astronomy. On the  southern edge of the city rises Panecillo, reminding one of Mount Tabor  by its symmetrical form, and over-looking the beautiful and well-watered  plain of Turubamba. On the east flows the Rio Machangara, and just  beyond it stand the Puengasi hills hiding the Chillo valley, while the  weary sun goes early to rest behind the towering peaks of Pichincha. So  encircled is this sequestered spot, the traveler, approaching by the  Guayaquil road, sees only a part of it, and is disappointed; and even  when standing on Panecillo, with the entire city spread out before him,  he is not wholly satisfied. Buried between treeless, sombre sierras, and  isolated from the rest of the world by impassable roads and gigantic  Cordilleras, Quito appears to us of the commercial nineteenth century as  useless as the old feudal towns perched on the mountains of Middle  Europe. Not a chimney rises above the red-tiled roofs, telling of  homely hearths beneath. No busy hum greets the ear; there are bugles  instead of spindles, and jingling church bells in place of rattling  carriages. The wandering eye does not look for a railroad or a  telegraph, for even the highways, such as they are, seem deserted, and,  save the music made for soldiers and saints, all is silent. The very  mountains, too, with their snow-mantled heads, and their sides scarred  by volcanic eruptions and ruptured by earthquake shocks, have a  melancholy look. In the words of a great artist, \"They look like a world  from which not only the human, but the spiritual presences had perished,  and the last of the archangels, building the great Andes for their  monuments, had laid themselves down to eternal rest, each in his  snow-white shroud.\"    But let us enter. Passing the ruined chapel \"Del Senor del buen pasaje,\"  and crossing by a substantial stone bridge the little Machangara  hastening to pay tribute to the Pacific, we leave behind us the dirty,  dilapidated suburbs of the capital. Soon we cross another bridge--the  Bridge of Buzzards--spanning a deep ravine, and gallop through the Plaza  de Santo Domingo. Very different are the sights and sounds from the stir  and style of Central Park. The scene has a semi-oriental cast--half  Indian, half Egyptian, as if this were the confluence of the Maranon and  Nile. Groups of men--not crowds, for there is plenty of elbow-room in  Ecuador--in gay ponchos stand chatting in front of little shops, or lean  against the wall to enjoy the sunshine; beggars in rags or sackcloth  stretch forth their leprous hands for charity; monks in white, and  canons in black, walk in the shade of immense hats; shoeless soldiers  saunter to and fro; Indians from the mountains in every variety of  costume cluster around heaps of vegetables for sale; women in red,  brown, and blue frocks are peddling oranges and alligator pears, or  bearing huge burdens on their heads; children, guiltless of clothing,  and obtuse donkeys, wander whithersoever they will; and water-carriers,  filling their jars at the fountain, start off on a dog-trot.    [Illustration: Quito, from the North.]    We cross the Plaza diagonally, pass down the Calle de San Fernando, up  the Calle del Algodon, and through the busy Calle del Correo, till we  reach the _Casa Frances_, opposite the mansion of the late General  Flores. This is our hotel--owned by a Frenchman, but kept by an Indian.  We ride under the low archway, bowing with ill grace, like all  republicans unaccustomed to royalty, tie our beasts in the court-yard,  ascend to our spacious quarters on the second floor, and, ordering  coffee, seat ourselves in the beautiful balcony to talk of Quito and  Quitonians.    [Illustration: Water-carriers.]    Quito, though not the highest city on the globe, is two thousand feet  higher than the Hospice of Great St. Bernard on the Alps, which is the  only permanent place of abode in Europe above six thousand five hundred  feet. When Mr. Hassaurek was appointed United States Minister to  Ecuador, he thanked Mr. Lincoln for conferring upon him the _highest_  gift in his power. The mean result of our numerous observations with  Green's standard barometer places the Grand Plaza nine thousand five  hundred and twenty feet above the sea, or fifty feet lower than the  calculation of Humboldt. Water boils at 194 deg..5. Cuzco and Potosi may  surpass it in altitude, but there is not a city in the world which can  show at once such a genial climate, such magnificent views, and such a  checkered history. It is unique likewise in its latitude, lying only  fifteen miles below the equator; no other capital comes within three  hundred miles of the equinoctial line.    [Illustration: Street in Quito.]    Whatever may have been the plan of Quito in the days of Huayna-Capac, it  is evident that the Spanish founders were guided more by the spurs of  Pichincha than by astronomy. The streets make an angle of forty-five  degrees with the meridian, so that not a single public building faces  any one of the four cardinal points of the compass. Two deep ravines  come down the mountain, and traverse the city from west to east. They  are mostly covered by arches, on which the houses rest; but where they  are open, they disclose as fit representatives of the place of torment  as the Valley of Hinnom. The outline of the city is as irregular as its  surface. It incloses one square mile. Twenty streets, all of them  straiter than the apostolic one in Damascus, cross one another very  nearly at right angles. None of them are too wide, and the walks are  painfully narrow; but, thanks to Garcia Moreno, they are well paved. The  inequality of the site, and its elevation above the Machangara, render  the drainage perfect.[21] The streets are dimly lighted by tallow  candles, every householder being obliged to hang out a lantern at 7  P.M., unless there is moonshine. The candles, however, usually expire  about ten o'clock. There are three \"squares\"--Plaza Mayor, Plaza de San  Francisco, and Plaza de Santo Domingo. The first is three hundred feet  square, and adorned with trees and flowers; the others are dusty and  unpaved, being used as market-places, where Indians and donkeys most do  congregate. All the plazas have fountains fed with pure water from  Pichincha.    [Footnote 21: The following quotation, however, is true to the letter,  and will apply equally well to Guayaquil and to Madrid--the mother of  them both: \"There is another want still more embarrassing in Quito than  the want of hotels--it is the want of water-closets and privies, which  are not considered as necessary fixtures of private residences. Men,  women, and children, of all ages and colors, may be seen in the middle  of the street, in broad daylight, making privies of the most public  thoroughfares; and while thus engaged, they will stare into the faces of  passers-by with a shamelessness that beggars description.\"--_Hassaurek_.]    Few buildings can boast of architectural beauty, yet Quito looks  palatial to the traveler who has just emerged from the dense forest on  the coast, \"crossing bridgeless rivers, floundering over bottomless  roads, and ascending and descending immense mountains.\" He is astonished  to find such elegant edifices and such a proud aristocracy in this lofty  lap of the Andes. The Indian habitations which girdle the city have no  more architectural pretensions than an Arab dwelling. They are low mud  hovels, the scene within and without of dirt and disorder.    As we approach the Grand Plaza, the centre of the city, the buildings  increase in size, style, and finish. The ordinary material is adobe, not  only because it is cheap, but also because it best resists earthquake  shocks. Fear of a _terremoto_ has likewise led to a massiveness in  construction which is slightly ludicrous when we see the poverty which  it protects; the walls are often two or three feet thick.

(#9)"],[1,"ominion, had made  such advances towards arts and civil manners, that they had built  twenty-eight considerable cities within their province, besides a great  number of villages and country seats; [*] but the fierce conquerors,  by whom they were now subdued, threw every thing back into ancient  barbarity; and those few natives, who were not either massacred or  expelled their habitations, were reduced to the most abject slavery.         [* Gildas, Sede, lib, i.]    None of the other northern conquerors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals, or  Burgundians, though they overran the southern provinces of the  empire like a mighty torrent, made such devastations in the conquered  territories, or were inflamed into so violent an animosity against the  ancient inhabitants. As the Saxons came over at intervals in separate  bodies, the Britons, however at first unwarlike, were tempted to make  resistance; and hostilities, being thereby prolonged, proved more  destructive to both parties, especially to the vanquished. The first  invaders from Germany, instead of excluding other adventurers, who must  share with them the spoils of the ancient inhabitants, were obliged to  solicit fresh supplies from their own country; and a total extermination  of the Britons became the sole expedient for providing a settlement and  subsistence to the new planters. Hence there have been found in history  few conquests more ruinous than that of the Saxons, and few revolutions  more violent than that which they introduced.      So long as the contest was maintained with the natives, the several  Saxon princes preserved a union of counsels and interests; but after the  Britons were shut up in the barren countries of Cornwall and Wales, and  gave no further disturbance to the conquerors, the band of alliance was  in a great measure dissolved among the princes of the Heptarchy. Though  one prince seems still to have been allowed, or to have assumed, an  ascendant over the whole, his authority, if it ought ever to be deemed  regular or legal, was extremely limited; and each state acted as if it  had been independent, and wholly separate from the rest Wars, therefore,  and revolutions and dissensions, were unavoidable among a turbulent and  military people; and these events, however intricate or confused, ought  now to become the objects of our attention But, added to the difficulty  of carrying on at once the history of seven independent kingdoms, there  is great discouragement to a writer, arising from the uncertainty, at  least barrenness, of the accounts transmitted to us. The monks, who were  the only annalists during those ages, lived remote from public  affairs, considered the civil transactions as entirely subordinate the  ecclesiastical, and, besides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity  which were then universal, were strongly infected with credulity, with  the love of wonder, and with a propensity to imposture; vices almost  inseparable from their profession and manner of life. The history of  that period abounds in names, but is extremely barren of events; or the  events are related so much without circumstances and causes, that the  most profound or most eloquent writer must despair of rendering them  either instructive or entertaining to the reader. Even the great  learning and vigorous imagination of Milton sunk under the weight; and  this author scruples not to declare, that the skirmishes of kites  or crows as much merited a particular narrative, as the confused  transactions and battles of the Saxon Heptarchy.[*] In order, however,  to connect the events in some tolerable measure, we shall give a  succinct account of the successions of kings, and of the more remarkable  revolutions in each particular kingdom; beginning with that of Kent,  which was the first established.         [* Milton in Kennet, p. 50]          THE KINGDOM OF KENT    Escus succeeded his father, Hengist, in the kingdom of Kent; but seems  not to have possessed the military genius of that conqueror, who first  made way for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain. All the  Saxons, who sought either the fame of valor, or new establishments by  arms, flocked to the standard of AElla, king of Sussex, who was carrying  on successful war against the Britons, and laying the foundations of a  new kingdom. Escus was content to possess in tranquillity the kingdom  of Kent, which he left in 512 to his son Octet, in whose time the East  Saxons established their monarchy, and dismembered the provinces of  Essex and Middlesex from that of Kent. His death, after a reign of  twenty two years, made room for his son Hermenric in 534, who performed  nothing memorable during a reign of thirty-two years; excepting  associating with him his son Ethelbert in the government, that he might  secure the succession hi his family, and prevent such revolutions as are  incident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy.    Ethelbert revived the reputation of his family, which had languished for  some generations. The inactivity of his predecessors, and the situation  of his country, secured from all hostility with the Britons, seem  to have much enfeebled the warlike genius of the Kentish Saxons;  and Ethelbert, in his first attempt to aggrandize his country, and  distinguish his own name, was unsuccessful.[*] He was twice discomfited  in battle by Ceaulin, king of Wessex, and obliged to yield the  superiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch, who preserved  no moderation in his victory, and by reducing the kingdom of Sussex to  subjection, excited jealousy in all the other princes. An association  was formed against him; and Ethelbeit, intrusted with the command of the  allies, gave him battle, and obtained a decisive victory.[**] Ceaulin  died soon after; and Ethelbert succeeded as well to his ascendant among  the Saxon states, as to his other ambitious projects. He reduced all the  princes, except the king of Northumberland, to a strict dependence upon  him; and even established himself by force on the throne of Mercia,  the most extensive of the Saxon kingdoms. Apprehensive, however, of a  dangerous league against him, like that by which he himself had been  enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the prudence to resign the kingdom  of Mercia to Webba, the rightful heir, the son of Crida, who had first  founded that monarchy. But governed still by ambition more than by  justice, he gave Webba possession of the crown on such conditions, as  rendered him little better than a tributary prince under his artful  benefactor.    But the most memorable event which distinguished the reign of this great  prince, was the introduction of the Christian religion among the English  Saxons. The superstition of the Germans, particularly that of the  Saxons, was of the grossest and most barbarous kind; and being founded  on traditional tales, received from their ancestors, not reduced to  any system, not supported by political institutions, like that of the  druids, it seems to have made little impression on its votaries, and to  have easily resigned its place to the new doctrine promulgated to them.  Woden, whom they deemed the ancestor of all their princes, was regarded  as the god of war, and, by a natural consequence, became their supreme  deity, and the chief object of their religious worship. They believed  that, if they obtained the favor of this divinity by their valor, (for  they made less account of the other virtues,) they should be admitted  after their death into his hall; and reposing on couches, should satiate  themselves with ale from the skulls of their enemies, whom they had  slain in battle. Incited by this idea of paradise, which gratified  at once the passion of revenge and that of intemperance, the ruling  inclinations of barbarians, they despised the dangers of war, and  increased their native ferocity against the vanquished by their  religious prejudices.         [* Chron. Sax. p. 21.]         [** H. Hunting, lib ii.]    We know little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons; we only  learn that they were polytheists; that they worshipped the sun and moon;  that they adored the god of thunder, under the name of Thor; that they  had images in their temples; that they practised sacrifices; believed  firmly in spells and enchantments; and admitted in general a system  of doctrines which they held as sacred, but which, like all other  superstition must carry the air of the wildest extravagance, if  propounded to those who are not familiarized to it from their earliest  infancy.    The constant hostilities which the Saxons maintained against the  Britons, would naturally indispose them for receiving the Christian  faith, when preached to them by such inveterate enemies; and perhaps the  Britons, as is objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not over-fond  of communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal life  and salvation. But as a civilized people, however subdued by arms, still  maintain a sensible superiority over barbarous and ignorant nations,  all the other northern conquerors of Europe had been already induced to  embrace the Christian faith, which they found established in the empire;  and it was impossible but the Saxons, informed of this event, must have  regarded with some degree of veneration a doctrine which had acquired  the ascendant over all their brethren. However limited in their news,  they could not but have perceived a degree of cultivation in the  southern countries beyond what they themselves possessed; and it was  natural for them to yield to that superior knowledge, as well as zeal,  by which the inhabitants of the Christian kingdoms were even at that  time distinguished.    But these causes might long have failed of producing any considerable  effect, had not a favorable incident prepared the means of introducing  Christianity into Kent. Ethelbert, in his father's lifetime, had married  Bertha, the only daughter of Cariben,"]]]
