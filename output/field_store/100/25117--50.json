Of the learned writers the best is a woman,  Francoise Paschal, of Lyons (b. about 1610); in spite of her Latinity she  shows a real feeling for her subjects. Some of her _Noels_ are dialogues  between the sacred personages; one presents |62| Joseph and Mary as  weary wayfarers seeking shelter at all the inns of Bethlehem and  everywhere refused by host or hostess:--            \"_Saint Joseph._        Voyons la _Rose-Rouge_.      Madame de ceans,      Auriez-vous quelque bouge      Pour de petites gens?            _L'Hotesse._        Vous n'avez pas la mine      D'avoir de grands tresors;      Voyez chez ma voisine,      Car, quant a moi, je dors.            _Saint Joseph._        Monsieur des _Trois-Couronnes_,      Avez-vous logement,      Chez vous pour trois personnes,      Quelque trou seulement.            _L'Hote._        Vous perdez votre peine,      Vous venez un peu tard,      Ma maison est fort pleine,      Allez quelqu'autre part.\"{10}    The most remarkable of the _patois Noelistes_ of the seventeenth century  are the Provencal Saboly and the Burgundian La Monnoye, the one kindly  and tender, the other witty and sarcastic. Here is one of Saboly's  Provencal _Noels_:--       \"Quand la miejonue sounavo,      Ai sauta dou liech au sou;      Ai vist un bel ange que cantavo      Milo fes pu dous qu'un roussignou.        Lei mastin dou vesinage      Se soun toutes atroupa; |63|      N'avien jamai vist aqueu visage      Se soun tout-d'un-cop mes a japa.        Lei pastre dessus la paio      Dourmien coume de soucas;      Quand an aussi lou bru dei sounaio      Au cresegu qu'ero lou souiras.        S'eron de gent resounable,      Vendrien sens estre envita:      Trouvarien dins un petit estable      La lumiero emai la verita.\"[24]{11}    As for La Monnoye, here is a translation of one of his satirical  verses:--\"When in the time of frost Jesus Christ came into the world the  ass and ox warmed Him with their breath in the stable. How many asses and  oxen I know in this kingdom of Gaul! How many asses and oxen I know who  would not have done as much!\"{12}           *       *       *       *       *    Apart from the rustic _Noels_, the eighteenth century produced little  French Christmas poetry of any charm. Some of the carols most sung in  French churches to-day belong, however, to this period, _e.g._, the  \"Venez, divin Messie\" of the Abbe Pellegrin.{13}           *       *       *       *       *    One cannot leave the France of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  without some mention of its Latin hymnody. From a date near 1700,  apparently, comes the sweet and solemn \"Adeste, fideles\"; by its music  and its rhythm, perhaps, rather than by its actual words it has become  the best beloved of Christmas hymns. The present writer has heard it sung  with equal reverence and heartiness in English, German, French, and  Italian churches, and no other hymn seems so full of the spirit of  Christmas devotion--wonder, |64| awe, and tenderness, and the sense of  reconciliation between Heaven and earth. Composed probably in France,  \"Adeste, fideles\" came to be used in English as well as French Roman  Catholic churches during the eighteenth century. In 1797 it was sung at  the chapel of the Portuguese Embassy in London; hence no doubt its once  common name of \"Portuguese hymn.\" It was first used in an Anglican church  in 1841, when the Tractarian Oakley translated it for his congregation at  Margaret Street Chapel, London.    Another fine Latin hymn of the eighteenth-century French Church is  Charles Coffin's \"Jam desinant suspiria.\"{14} It appeared in the  Parisian Breviary in 1736, and is well known in English as \"God from on  high hath heard.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Revolution and the decay of Catholicism in France seem to have killed  the production of popular carols. The later nineteenth century, however,  saw a revival of interest in the _Noel_ as a literary form. In 1875 the  bicentenary of Saboly's death was celebrated by a competition for a  _Noel_ in the Provencal tongue, and something of the same kind has been  done in Brittany.{15} The _Noel_ has attracted by its aesthetic charm  even poets who are anything but devout; Theophile Gautier, for instance,  wrote a graceful Christmas carol, \"Le ciel est noir, la terre est  blanche.\"    On a general view of the vernacular Christmas poetry of France it must be  admitted that the devotional note is not very strong; there is indeed a  formal reverence, a courtly homage, paid to the Infant Saviour, and the  miraculous in the Gospel story is taken for granted; but there is little  sense of awe and mystery. In harmony with the realistic instincts of the  nation, everything is dramatically, very humanly conceived; at times,  indeed, the personages of the Nativity scenes quite lose their sacred  character, and the treatment degenerates into grossness. At its best,  however, the French _Noel_ has a gaiety and a grace, joined to a genuine,  if not very deep, piety, that are extremely charming. Reading these  rustic songs, we are carried in imagination to French countrysides; we  think of the long walk through the snow to the Midnight Mass, the  cheerful _reveillon_ spread on the |65| return, the family gathered  round the hearth, feasting on wine and chestnuts and _boudins_, and  singing in traditional strains the joys of _Noel_.           *       *       *       *       *    Across the Pyrenees, in Spain, the late sixteenth and early seventeenth  centuries saw a great output of Christmas verse. Among the chief writers  were Juan Lopez de Ubeda, Francisco de Ocana, and Jose de  Valdivielso.{16} Their _villancicos_ remind one of the paintings of  Murillo; they have the same facility, the same tender and graceful  sentiment, without much depth. They lack the homely flavour, the  quaintness that make the French and German folk-carols so delightful;  they have not the rustic tang, and yet they charm by their simplicity and  sweetness.    Here are a few stanzas by Ocana:--       \"Dentro de un pobre pesebre      y cobijado con heno      yace Jesus Nazareno.          En el heno yace echado      el hijo de Dios eterno,      para librar del infierno      al hombre que hubo criado,      y por matar el pecado      el heno tiene por bueno      nuestro Jesus Nazareno.          Esta entre dos animales      que le calientan del frio,      quien remedia nuestros males      con su grande poderio:      es su reino y senorio      el mundo y el cielo sereno,      y agora duerme en el heno.          Tiene por bueno sufrir      el frio y tanta fortuna,      sin tener ropa ninguna      con que se abrigar ni cubrir, |66|      y por darnos el vivir      padecio frio en el heno,      nuestro Jesus Nazareno.\"[25]{17}    More of a peasant flavour is found in some snatches of Christmas carols  given by Fernan Caballero in her sketch, \"La Noche de Navidad.\"          \"Ha nacido en un portal,      Llenito de telaranas,      Entre la mula y el buey      El Redentor de las almas.           *       *       *       *       *          En el portal de Belen      Hay estrella, sol y luna:      La Virgen y San Jose      Y el nino que esta en la cuna.          En Belen tocan a fuego,      Del portal sale la llama,      Es una estrella del cielo,      Que ha caido entre la paja.          Yo soy un pobre gitano      Que vengo de Egipto aqui,      Y al nino de Dios le traigo      Un gallo quiquiriqui          Yo soy un pobre gallego      Que vengo de la Galicia,      Y al nino de Dios le traigo      Lienzo para una camisa. |67|          Al nino recien nacido      Todos le traen un don;      Yo soy chico y nada tengo;      Le traigo mi corazon.\"[26]{18}    In nearly every western language one finds traditional Christmas carols.  Europe is everywhere alive with them; they spring up like wild flowers.  Some interesting Italian specimens are given by Signor de Gubernatis in  his \"Usi Natalizi.\" Here are a few stanzas from a Bergamesque cradle-song  of the Blessed Virgin:--          \"Dormi, dormi, o bel bambin,      Re divin.      Dormi, dormi, o fantolin.      Fa la nanna, o caro figlio,      Re del Ciel,      Tanto bel, grazioso giglio.          Chiuedi i luemi, o mio tesor,      Dolce amor,      Di quest' alma, almo Signor;      Fa la nanna, o regio infante,      Sopra il fien,      Caro ben, celeste amante.          Perche piangi, o bambinell,      Forse il giel      Ti da noia, o l'asinell?      Fa la nanna, o paradiso      Del mio cor,      Redentor, ti bacio il viso.\"[27]{19}    |68| With this lullaby may be compared a singularly lovely and quite  untranslatable Latin cradle-song of unknown origin:--       \"Dormi, fili, dormi! mater           Cantat unigenito:      Dormi, puer, dormi! pater,           Nato clamat parvulo:      Millies tibi laudes canimus           Mille, mille, millies.        Lectum stravi tibi soli,           Dormi, nate bellule!      Stravi lectum foeno molli:           Dormi, mi animule.      Millies tibi laudes canimus           Mille, mille, millies.        Ne quid desit, sternam rosis,           Sternam foenum violis,      Pavimentum hyacinthis           Et praesepe liliis.      Millies tibi laudes canimus           Mille, mille, millies. |69|        Si vis musicam, pastores          Convocabo protinus;      Illis nulli sunt priores;          Nemo canit castius.      Millies tibi laudes canimus          Mille, mille, millies.\"{21}    Curious little poems are found in Latin and other languages, making a  dialogue of the cries of animals at the news of Christ's birth.{22} The  following French example is fairly typical:--       \"Comme les bestes autrefois      Parloient mieux latin que francois,      Le coq, de loin voyant le fait,      S'ecria: _Christus natus est._      Le boeuf, d'un air tout ebaubi,      Demande: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#9)"],[1," fancies: for some of them considering the mysteries implied  in the number 3. concluded that there must necessarily bee a Trinity of  worlds, whereof the first is this of ours, the second in the Moone whose  element of water is represented by the spheare of _Mercury_, the aire by  _Uenus_, and the fire by the Sunne. And that the whole Universe might  the better end in earth as it began, they have contrived it, that _Mars_  shall be a spheare of the fire, _Iupiter_ of aire, _Saturne_ of water;  and above all these, the Elysian fields, spacious and pleasant places  appointed for the habitation of those unspotted soules, that either  never were imprisoned in, or else now have freed themselves from any  commerce with the body. _Scaliger_[2] speaking of this _Platonicke_  fancie, _quae in tres trientes mundum quasi assem divisit_, thinks 'tis  confutation enough, to say, 'tis _Plato's_. However for the first part  of this assertion, it was assented unto by many others, and by reason of  the grossnesse and inequality of this planet, 'twas frequently called  _quasi terra coelestis_, as being esteemed the sediment and more  imperfect part of those purer bodies, you may see this proved by  _Plutarch_,[3] in that delightfull work which he properly made for the  confirmition of this particular. With him agreed _Alcinous_[4] and  _Plotinus_, later Writers. Unto these I might also adde the imperfect  testimony of _Mahomet_, whose authority of grant can adde but little  credit to this opinion, because hee was an ignorant imposter, but yet  consider that originall, from whence hee derived most of his knowledge,  and then, perhaps, his witnesse may carry with it some probablity. He is  commonly thought by birth to be an Ismaelite, being instructed by the  Jewes in the secrets of their Philosophy,[5] and perhaps, learned this  from those Rabbies, for in his _Alcaron_, hee talkes much of mountaines,  pleasant fields, and cleare rivers in the heavens, but because he was  for the maine very unlearned, he was not able to deliver any thing so  distinctly as he was informed.[6] The Cardinall _Cusanus_ and _Iornandus  Bunus_, held a particular world in every Starre, and therefore one of  them defining our earth, he saies, it is      _stella quaedam nobilis, quae lunam & calorem & influentiam habet    aliam, & diversam ab omnibus aliis stellis_;    a \"noble starre having a distinct light, heat and influence from all the  rest.\" Unto this _Nichol. Hill_, a country man of ours was inclined,  when he said _Astrea terrae natura probabilis est_: \"That 'tis probable  the earth hath a starry nature.\"[7]      [Sidenote 1: _Plat. de conviviis._    _Macrob. Somn. Scip. lib. 1. ca. 11._]      [Sidenote 2: _Exercit. 62._]      [Sidenote 3: _De facie Lunae._]      [Sidenote 4: _Instit. ad discip._ Plat. _Cael. Rhodig. l. 1. c. 4._]      [Sidenote 5: _Azoara. 57. & 65._]      [Sidenote 6: _Cusa. de doct. ign. l. 2. cap. 12._]      [Sidenote 7: _Philos. epicur. part. 434._]    But the opinion which I have here delivered was more directly proved by  _Maeslin_, _Keplar_, and _Galilaeus_, each of them late writers, and  famous men for their singular skill in Astronomy.[1] As for those workes  of _Maeslin_ and _Keplar_ wherein they doe more expresly treate of this  opinion, I have not yet had the happinesse to see them. However their  opinions appeare plaine enough from their owne writings, and the  testimony of others concerning them. But _Iulius Caesar_, whom I have  above quoted, speaking of their testimony whom I now cite for this  opinion,[2] _viz._ _Keplar_ and _Galilaeus_ affirmes that to his  knowledge they did but jest in those things which they write concerning  this, and as for any such world, he assuredly knowes they never so much  as dreamt of it. But I had rather believe their owne words, then his  pretended knowledge.      [Sidenote 1: _In Thesibus_    _dissertatio cum Nic. Hill._    _Nuncius Sydereus._]      [Sidenote 2: _De phaenom. lunae. c. 4._]    'Tis true indeed, in many things they doe but trifle, but for the maine  scope of those discourses, 'tis as manifest they seriously meant it, as  any indifferent Reader may easily discerne; otherwise sure _Campanella_  (a man as well acquainted with his opinion, and perhaps his person as  _Caesar_ was) would never have writ an apologie for him. And besides 'tis  very likely if it had beene but a jest, _Galilaeus_ would never have  suffered so much for it as afterwards he did. But as for the knowledge  which hee pretends, you may guesse what it was by his confidence (I say  not presumption) in other assertions, and his boldnesse[1] in them may  well derogate from his credit in this. For speaking of _Ptolome's_  _Hypothesis_ he pronounces this verdict,      _Impossibile est excentricorum & epicyclorum positio, nec aliquis    est ex Mathematicis adeo stultus qui veram illam existimet._      \"The position of _Excentricks_ and _Epicycles_ is altogether    impossible, nor is there any Mathematician such a foole as to    thinke it true.\"    I should guesse hee could not have knowledge enough to maintaine any  other Hypothesis who was so ignorant in Mathematicks, as to deny that  any good Authour held this. For I would faine know whether there were  never any that thought the Heavens to be solid bodies, and that there  were such kindes of motion as is by those feined Orbes supplyed; if so,  then _Caesar la Galla_ was much mistaken. I thinke his assertions are  equally true, that _Galilaeus_ and _Keplar_ did not hold this, and that  there were none which ever held that other.      [Sidenote 1: _Cap. 7._]    But in my following discourse I shall most insist on the observation of  _Galilaeus_, the inventour of that famous perspective, whereby we may  discerne the heavens hard by us, whereby those things which others have  formerly guest at are manifested to the eye, and plainely discovered  beyond exception or doubt, of which admirable invention, these latter  ages of the world may justly boast, and for this expect to be celebrated  by posterity. 'Tis related of _Eudoxus_, that hee wished himselfe burnt  with _Phaeton_, so he might stand over the Sunne to contemplate its  nature; had hee lived in these daies, he might have enjoyed his wish at  an easie rate, and scaling the heavens by this glasse, might plainely  have discerned what hee so much desired. _Keplar_ considering those  strange discoveries which this perspective had made, could not choose  but cry out in a +prosopopeia+ and rapture of admiration.      _O multiscium & quovis sceptro pretiosius perspicillum! an qui te    dextra tenet, ille non dominus constituatur operum Dei?_    And _Johannes Fabricius_[1] an elegant writer, speaking of the same  glasse, and for this invention preferring our age before those former  times of greater ignorance, saies thus;      _Adeo sumus superiores veteribus, ut quam illi carminis magici    pronunciatu de missam representasse putantur nos non tantum    innocenter demittamus, sed etiam familiari quodam intuitu ejus quasi    conditionem intueamur._      \"So much are wee above the ancients, that whereas they were faine by    their magical charms to represent the Moones approach, wee cannot    onely bring her lower with a greater innocence, but may also with a    more familiar view behold her condition.\"    And because you shall have no occasion to question the truth of those  experiments, which I shal afterwards urge from it; I will therefore set  downe the testimony of an enemy, and such a witnesse hath alwaies beene  accounted prevalent: you may see it in the abovenamed _Caesar la  Galla_,[2] whose words are these:      _Mercurium caduceum gestantem, coelestia nunciare, & mortuorum animas    ab inferis revacare sapiens finxit antiquitas. Galilaeum vero novum    Iovis interpretem Telescopio caducaeo instructum Sydera aperire, &    veterum Philosophorum manes ad superos revocare solers nostra aetas    videt & admiratur._    Wise antiquity fabled _Mercury_ carrying a rodde in his hand to relate  newes from Heaven, and call backe the soules of the dead, but it hath  beene the happinesse of our industrious age to see and admire _Galilaeus_  the new Embassadour of the Gods furnished with his perspective to unfold  the nature of the Starres, and awaken the ghosts of the ancient  Philosophers. So worthily and highly did these men esteeme of this  excellent invention.      [Sidenote 1: _De macula in sole obser._]      [Sidenote 2: _De phaenom. c. 1._]    Now if you would know what might be done by this glasse, in the sight of  such things as were neerer at hand, the same Authour will tell you,[1]  when hee sayes, that by it those things which could scarce at all bee  discerned by the eye at the distance of a mile and a halfe, might  plainely and distinctly bee perceived for 16 Italian miles, and that as  they were really in themselves, without any transposition or falsifying  at all. So that what the ancient Poets were faine to put in a fable, our  more happy age hath found out in a truth, and we may discerne as farre  with these eyes which _Galilaeus_ hath bestowed upon us, as _Lynceus_  could with those which the Poets attributed unto him. But if you yet  doubt whether all these observations were true, the same Authour may  confirme you,[2] when hee saies they were shewed,      _Non uni aut alteri, sed quamplurimis, neque gregariis hominibus,    sed praecipuis atque disciplinis omnibus, necnon Mathematicis &    opticis praeceptis, optime instructis sedula ac diligenti inspectione_.      \"Not to one or two, but to very many, and those not ordinary men,    but to those who were well vers'd in Mathematickes and Opticks,    and that not with a meere glance but with a sedulous and diligent    inspection.\"    And least any scruple might remaine unanswered, or you might thinke the  men who beheld all this though they might be skilfull, yet they came  with credulous minds, and so were more easie to be deluded.
