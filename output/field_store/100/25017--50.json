Since then more  than 53,000,000 tons have been taken out of these beds and the  exportation has risen to a rate of 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 tons a year.  How much longer they will last is a matter of opinion and opinion is  largely influenced by whether you have your money invested in Chilean  nitrate stock or in one of the new synthetic processes for making  nitrates. The United States Department of Agriculture says the nitrate  beds will be exhausted in a few years. On the other hand the Chilean  Inspector General of Nitrate Deposits in his latest official report says  that they will last for two hundred years at the present rate and that  then there are incalculable areas of low grade deposits, containing less  than eleven per cent., to be drawn upon.    Anyhow, the South American beds cannot long supply the world's need of  nitrates and we shall some time be starving unless creative chemistry  comes to the rescue. In 1898 Sir William Crookes--the discoverer of the  \"Crookes tubes,\" the radiometer and radiant matter--startled the British  Association for the Advancement of Science by declaring that the world  was nearing the limit of wheat production and that by 1931 the  bread-eaters, the Caucasians, would have to turn to other grains or  restrict their population while the rice and millet eaters of Asia would  continue to increase. Sir William was laughed at then as a  sensationalist. He was, but his sensations were apt to prove true and it  is already evident that he was too near right for comfort. Before we  were half way to the date he set we had two wheatless days a week,  though that was because we persisted in shooting nitrates into the air.  The area producing wheat was by decades:[1]    THE WHEAT FIELDS OF THE WORLD                          Acres    1881-90             192,000,000  1890-1900           211,000,000  1900-10             242,000,000  Probable limit      300,000,000    If 300,000,000 acres can be brought under cultivation for wheat and the  average yield raised to twenty bushels to the acre, that will give  enough to feed a billion people if they eat six bushels a year as do the  English. Whether this maximum is correct or not there is evidently some  limit to the area which has suitable soil and climate for growing wheat,  so we are ultimately thrown back upon Crookes's solution of the problem;  that is, we must increase the yield per acre and this can only be done  by the use of fertilizers and especially by the fixation of atmospheric  nitrogen. Crookes estimated the average yield of wheat at 12.7 bushels  to the acre, which is more than it is in the new lands of the United  States, Australia and Russia, but less than in Europe, where the soil is  well fed. What can be done to increase the yield may be seen from these  figures:      GAIN IN THE YIELD OF WHEAT IN BUSHELS PER ACRE                         1889-90  1913      Germany              19      35    Belgium              30      35    France               17      20    United Kingdom       28      32    United States        12      15    The greatest gain was made in Germany and we see a reason for it in the  fact that the German importation of Chilean saltpeter was 55,000 tons in  1880 and 747,000 tons in 1913. In potatoes, too, Germany gets twice as  big a crop from the same ground as we do, 223 bushels per acre instead  of our 113 bushels. But the United States uses on the average only 28  pounds of fertilizer per acre, while Europe uses 200.    It is clear that we cannot rely upon Chile, but make nitrates for  ourselves as Germany had to in war time. In the first chapter we  considered the new methods of fixing the free nitrogen from the air. But  the fixation of nitrogen is a new business in this country and our chief  reliance so far has been the coke ovens. When coal is heated in retorts  or ovens for making coke or gas a lot of ammonia comes off with the  other products of decomposition and is caught in the sulfuric acid used  to wash the gas as ammonium sulfate. Our American coke-makers have been  in the habit of letting this escape into the air and consequently we  have been losing some 700,000 tons of ammonium salts every year, enough  to keep our land rich and give us all the explosives we should need. But  now they are reforming and putting in ovens that save the by-products  such as ammonia and coal tar, so in 1916 we got from this source 325,000  tons a year.    [Illustration: Courtesy of _Scientific American_.    Consumption of potash for agricultural purposes in different countries]    Germany had a natural monopoly of potash as Chile had a natural monopoly  of nitrates. The agriculture of Europe and America has been virtually  dependent upon these two sources of plant foods. Now when the world was  cleft in twain by the shock of August, 1914, the Allied Powers had the  nitrates and the Central Powers had the potash. If Germany had not had  up her sleeve a new process for making nitrates she could not long have  carried on a war and doubtless would not have ventured upon it. But the  outside world had no such substitute for the German potash salts and  has not yet discovered one. Consequently the price of potash in the  United States jumped from $40 to $400 and the cost of food went up with  it. Even under the stimulus of prices ten times the normal and with  chemists searching furnace crannies and bad lands the United States was  able to scrape up less than 10,000 tons of potash in 1916, and this was  barely enough to satisfy our needs for two weeks!    [Illustration: What happened to potash when the war broke out. This  diagram from the _Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_ of  July, 1917, shows how the supply of potassium muriate from Germany was  shut off in 1914 and how its price rose.]    Yet potash compounds are as cheap as dirt. Pick up a handful of gravel  and you will be able to find much of it feldspar or other mineral  containing some ten per cent. of potash. Unfortunately it is in  combination with silica, which is harder to break up than a trust.    But \"constant washing wears away stones\" and the potash that the  metallurgist finds too hard to extract in his hottest furnace is washed  out in the course of time through the dropping of the gentle rain from  heaven. \"All rivers run to the sea\" and so the sea gets salt, all sorts  of salts, principally sodium chloride (our table salt) and next  magnesium, calcium and potassium chlorides or sulfates in this order of  abundance. But if we evaporate sea-water down to dryness all these are  left in a mix together and it is hard to sort them out. Only patient  Nature has time for it and she only did on a large scale in one place,  that is at Stassfurt, Germany. It seems that in the days when  northwestern Prussia was undetermined whether it should be sea or land  it was flooded annually by sea-water. As this slowly evaporated the  dissolved salts crystallized out at the critical points, leaving beds of  various combinations. Each year there would be deposited three to five  inches of salts with a thin layer of calcium sulfate or gypsum on top.  Counting these annual layers, like the rings on a stump, we find that  the Stassfurt beds were ten thousand years in the making. They were  first worked for their salt, common salt, alone, but in 1837 the  Prussian Government began prospecting for new and deeper deposits and  found, not the clean rock salt that they wanted, but bittern, largely  magnesium sulfate or Epsom salt, which is not at all nice for table use.  This stuff was first thrown away until it was realized that it was much  more valuable for the potash it contains than was the rock salt they  were after. Then the Germans began to purify the Stassfurt salts and  market them throughout the world. They contain from fifteen to  twenty-five per cent. of magnesium chloride mixed with magnesium  chloride in \"carnallite,\" with magnesium sulfate in \"kainite\" and sodium  chloride in \"sylvinite.\" More than thirty thousand miners and workmen  are employed in the Stassfurt works. There are some seventy distinct  establishments engaged in the business, but they are in combination. In  fact they are compelled to be, for the German Government is as anxious  to promote trusts as the American Government is to prevent them. Once  the Stassfurt firms had a falling out and began a cutthroat competition.  But the German Government objects to its people cutting each other's  throats. American dealers were getting unheard of bargains when the  German Government stepped in and compelled the competing corporations to  recombine under threat of putting on an export duty that would eat up  their profits.    The advantages of such business cooeperation are specially shown in  opening up a new market for an unknown product as in the case of the  introduction of the Stassfurt salts into American agriculture. The  farmer in any country is apt to be set in his ways and when it comes to  inducing him to spend his hard-earned money for chemicals that he never  heard of and could not pronounce he--quite rightly--has to be shown.  Well, he was shown. It was, if I remember right, early in the nineties  that the German Kali Syndikat began operations in America and the United  States Government became its chief advertising agent. In every state  there was an agricultural experiment station and these were provided  liberally with illustrated literature on Stassfurt salts with colored  wall charts and sets of samples and free sacks of salts for field  experiments.

To ancient, sweet-do-nothing days        Among the kirtle-robed Sicilians.        And as it stilled the multitude,        And yet more joyous rose, and shriller,      I saw the minstrel where he stood        At ease against a Doric pillar:      One hand a droning organ played,        The other held a Pan's-pipe (fashioned      Like those of old) to lips that made        The reeds give out that strain impassioned.        'Twas Pan himself had wandered here        A-strolling through this sordid city,      And piping to the civic ear        The prelude of some pastoral ditty!      The demigod had crossed the seas,--        From haunts of shepherd, nymph, and satyr,      And Syracusan times,--to these        Far shores and twenty centuries later.        A ragged cap was on his head;        But--hidden thus--there was no doubting      That, all with crispy locks o'erspread,        His gnarled horns were somewhere sprouting;      His club-feet, cased in rusty shoes,        Were crossed, as on some frieze you see them,      And trousers, patched of divers hues,        Concealed his crooked shanks beneath them.        He filled the quivering reeds with sound,        And o'er his mouth their changes shifted,      And with his goat's-eyes looked around        Where'er the passing current drifted;      And soon, as on Trinacrian hills        The nymphs and herdsmen ran to hear him,      Even now the tradesmen from their tills,        With clerks and porters, crowded near him.        The bulls and bears together drew        From Jauncey Court and New Street Alley,      As erst, if pastorals be true,        Came beasts from every wooded valley;      And random passers stayed to list,--        A boxer AEgon, rough and merry,      A Broadway Daphnis, on his tryst        With Nais at the Brooklyn Ferry.        A one-eyed Cyclops halted long        In tattered cloak of army pattern,      And Galatea joined the throng,--        A blowsy apple-vending slattern;      While old Silenus staggered out        From some new-fangled lunch-house handy,      And bade the piper, with a shout,        To strike up Yankee Doodle Dandy!        A newsboy and a peanut-girl        Like little Fauns began to caper;      His hair was all in tangled curl,        Her tawny legs were bare and taper;      And still the gathering larger grew,        And gave its pence and crowded nigher,      While aye the shepherd-minstrel blew        His pipe, and struck the gamut higher.        O heart of Nature, beating still        With throbs her vernal passion taught her,--      Even here, as on the vine-clad hill,        Or by the Arethusan water!      New forms may fold the speech, new lands        Arise within these ocean-portals,      But Music waves eternal wands,--        Enchantress of the souls of mortals!        So thought I,--but among us trod        A man in blue, with legal baton,      And scoffed the vagrant demigod,        And pushed him from the step I sat on.      Doubting I mused upon the cry,        \"Great Pan is dead!\"--and all the people      Went on their ways:--and clear and high        The quarter sounded from the steeple.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    The author sees an organ-grinder playing his gay tunes in Wall Street,  New York, among the buildings where enormous financial transactions are  carried on. He (the author) imagines this wandering minstrel to be Pan  himself, assuming a modern form. Read the notes carefully for what is  said about Pan. Notice, in the poem, how skillfully the author brings  out the contrast between the easy-going days of ancient Greece and the  busy, rushing times of modern America. Of what value is the word  _serenely_ in the first stanza? What is the \"curbstone war\"? Do you  think the old-fashioned Pan's pipe is common now? Could a man play an  organ and a pipe at the same time? Why is the city spoken of as  \"sordid\"? What is the \"civic ear\"? In the description of the player, how  is the idea of his being Pan emphasized? How was it that the bulls and  bears drew together? In plain words who were the people whom the author  describes under Greek names? Show how aptly the mythological characters  are fitted to modern persons. Read carefully what is said about the  power of music, in the stanza beginning \"O heart of Nature.\" Who was the  man in blue? Why did he interfere? Why is the organ-grinder called a  \"vagrant demigod\"? What was it that the author doubted? What is meant  here by \"Great Pan is dead\"? Does the author mean more than the mere  words seem to express? Do you think that people are any happier in these  commercial times than they were in ancient Greece? After you have  studied the poem and mastered all the references, read the poem through,  thinking of its meaning and its lively measure.    Read Mrs. Browning's poem, _A Musical Instrument_, which is about Pan  and his pipe of reeds.
