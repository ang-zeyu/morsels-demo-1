Meantime David was to  remain in hiding, but on the third day Jonathan was to return with the  required information. Before they parted they entered into a solemn  covenant, one with the other, to remain firm friends during life; and  David promised to show kindness to Jonathan and his children, after  God should make him king.    At the time appointed, after ascertaining that Saul still sought  David's life, Jonathan went to the field where David lay concealed.  Jonathan took with him his bow and arrows and a little lad. Shooting  an arrow beyond the lad, he cried, \"Make speed, haste, stay not!\"  These words were intended as a warning to David to flee quickly. When  the lad had gone, David arose from his hiding place and came to  Jonathan, bowing three times before him. Then they kissed each other,  wept, and again pledged themselves to be faithful; after which David  fled, and Jonathan returned to the city.             *       *       *       *       *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17163"],[0,"Mother Stories from the New Testament (#9)"],[1,"r's name was Lois.  Both loved the little boy Timothy, or Timotheus as he was called, and  they sought to instil into his young mind and heart the love of God  and the knowledge of His holy Word. In our picture we see Eunice  teaching her son. She has not a bound Bible, but a manuscript, wound  round small rollers. From this she reads to Timothy; while Lois, the  aged grandmother, sits by.    Paul warned Timothy not to forget the teaching of his good mother and  grandmother; and especially to value his knowledge of the Scriptures.  Because, said Paul, \"they are able to make thee wise unto salvation.\"  Many young folks have good mothers and grandmothers, who love to teach  them about Jesus. Are they receiving this teaching as Timothy did, and  being made wise unto salvation?    [Illustration: LOIS, EUNICE AND TIMOTHY.]          CHRIST BLESSING THE CHILDREN.    (_See_ Frontispiece).      Jesus had left Galilee, and was journeying toward Jerusalem, where He  was to be put to death. He was in the country beyond Jordan, called  Peraea, and had been speaking some very wise words to the Pharisees,  and also to His disciples, when some women came to Him, bringing  infants and young children that He might put His hands upon them and  pray for them. The disciples thinking probably that Jesus, who had so  many important things to attend to, would not wish to be troubled by  women bringing their children, rebuked them for so doing. But Jesus  loved children. So, when He saw the disciples about to send them away,  He was displeased; and, calling the disciples to Him, He said, \"Suffer  little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of such is  the kingdom of God.\" Then, we are told, Jesus \"took them up in His  arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them.\" How kind was Jesus!  and how willing that the little ones should be brought to Him! And He  is the same now. May all our young readers learn to love Him, and find  for themselves how willing He is to love and bless them.             *       *       *       *       *"]]]
