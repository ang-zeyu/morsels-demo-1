Des  Marets, La Routte, a pilot, and nine men accompanied the expedition. On  their voyage they passed certain rivers to which Champlain gave the  following names, Ste. Suzanne (River du Loup), du Pont (Nicolet), de  Genes (Yamaska), and the Three Rivers.[11] The party stopped at the  entrance of the Iroquois River. Continuing their journey southwards,  they arrived at the Chambly Rapids. \"No Christians had been in this  place before us,\" says Champlain. Seeing no prospect of being able to  cross the rapids alone, Champlain embarked with the Indians in their  canoes, taking only two men with him. Champlain's army, comprising  sixty men, then proceeded slowly towards Lake Champlain, and a few days  after the party arrived at Lake St. Sacrament (Lake George). On July  29th they encountered the Iroquois, who had come to fight, at the  extremity of Lake Champlain, on the western bank. The entire night was  spent by each army in dancing and singing, and in bandying words. At  daybreak Champlain's men stood to arms. The Iroquois were composed of  about two hundred men, stout and rugged in appearance, with their three  chiefs at their head, who could be distinguished by their large plumes.  The Indians opened their ranks and called upon Champlain to go to the  front. The arrows were beginning to fly on both sides when Champlain  discharged his musket, which was loaded with four balls, and killed two  of the chiefs and mortally wounded the third. This unexpected blow  caused great alarm among the Iroquois, who lost courage, abandoned their  camp and took to flight, seeking shelter in the woods. Fifteen or  sixteen men of Champlain's party were wounded, but the enemy had many  wounded, and ten or twelve were taken prisoners.    This victory did not entail much hardship on the part of the French.  Champlain and his two companions did more to rout the Iroquois than the  sixty allies with their shower of arrows. The result of this day's  proceedings was highly satisfactory to the Indians, who gathered up the  arms and provisions left behind by the Iroquois, and feasted  sumptuously amidst dancing and singing. \"The spot where this attack took  place,\" says Champlain, \"is in the latitude of 43 deg. and some minutes, and  the lake is called Champlain.\" This place is now called Ticonderoga, or  the Cheondoroga of the Indians.    Champlain returned to Quebec with the Montagnais, and a few days after  he set out for Tadousac to see whether Pont-Grave had arrived from  Gaspe. He met Pont-Grave on the morrow, and they both decided to sail  for France, and to leave Quebec in the meantime under the command of  Pierre de Chauvin,[12] pending the decision of de Monts as to the future  of the colony. Both visited Quebec in order to invest Chauvin with  authority, and after leaving him everything necessary for the use of the  settlement, and placing fifteen men under his command, the two  commanders left Quebec on September 1st, 1609, and sailed from Tadousac  for France on the fifth day of the same month.    Champlain had sojourned in New France since the beginning of July, 1608,  and during that interval he had made good use of his time. He had chosen  the most suitable place for a habitation which was destined to become  the metropolis of the French colony; he had constructed a fort and a  storehouse, and he had also explored a very important tract of country.  Champlain had also visited a part of the river Saguenay; he had made  himself acquainted with the vicinity of Quebec, and with the rivers,  streams and tributaries of the St. Lawrence and Ste. Croix. For the  second time he had seen the river St. Lawrence as far as the Iroquois  River over which he had sailed as far as Lake Champlain, whence it  receives its waters. Besides his achievements in exploration Champlain  had cemented friendly relations with the Montagnais, Algonquins and  Hurons; he had renewed his acquaintance with Anadabijou and formed an  alliance with Iroquet and Ochateguin, three of the most powerful chiefs  of these tribes. He was also well versed in their methods of warfare and  had studied their manners and customs and their treatment of their  prisoners, so that when he returned to France he was in a position to  give de Monts a great deal of valuable information, both as regards the  inhabitants and the best means of promoting trade with them.    On his arrival in France Champlain proceeded at once to Fontainebleau,  where he met King Henry IV and de Monts. He had an audience with the  king and gave His Majesty a satisfactory account of his proceedings. He  also presented to the king a girdle made of porcupine quills, two little  birds of carnation colour, and the head of a fish caught in Lake  Champlain, which had a very long snout, and two or three rows of very  sharp teeth.    To de Monts the visit of Champlain was of great importance, because the  fate of Quebec was bound up with him. After hearing Champlain's  narrative of his voyages in New France, de Monts decided to visit Rouen  in order to consult Collier and Legendre, his associates. After  deliberation they resolved to continue their efforts to colonize New  France and to further explore the great river St. Lawrence. In order to  realize means for defraying the expenses of the expedition, Pont-Grave  was authorized to engage in any traffic that would help to accomplish  this end. In the meantime Lucas Legendre was ordered to purchase  merchandise for the expedition, to see to the repairs of the vessels,  and to obtain crews. After these details had been arranged de Monts and  Champlain returned to Paris to settle the more important questions.    De Monts' commission, which had been issued for one year, had expired,  but he hoped that it would be renewed. His requests, which appeared just  and reasonable, were, however, refused, owing to protests on the part of  merchants of Bretagne and Normandy, who claimed that this monopoly was  ruinous to their commerce. Finally de Monts appealed to his former  partners, who decided to furnish two vessels, at their own expense, with  supplies and stores necessary for the settlement. Pont-Grave was given  the command of a fur-trading vessel, and the other was laden with  provisions and stores necessary for the use of the settlers. Champlain  was informed that his services were dispensed with, but not believing  that this news could be true, he saw de Monts and asked him frankly  whether such was the case. De Monts told him that he could accompany the  expedition, if he chose to do so. Champlain therefore set out from Paris  on the last day of February, 1610, and proceeded to Rouen, where he  remained for two days, and then left for Honfleur, to meet Pont-Grave  and Legendre, who informed him that the vessels were ready to sail.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] Le Testu's Christian name was Guillaume. His first voyage to  Newfoundland was made in 1601. He came to Quebec in 1608, 1610, 1611,  1612, 1613, 1614, and 1616. He was successively captain of the _Fleur de  Lys_, the _Trinite_ and the _Nativite_. He was very circumspect in his  dealings.    [10] Champlain often speaks of this man. His true name was Claude Godet,  Sieur des Marets. His father, Cleophas Godet, a lawyer, had three sons,  Claude, Jean and Jesse. Jean was Sieur du Parc, and Jesse parish priest  of Chambois in 1634. Both Claude and Jean came to Canada. Claude des  Marets was married, in 1615, to Jeanne Grave, only daughter of Francois  Grave, Sieur du Pont. He died about the year 1626, leaving one child  named Francois, who came to New France with his grandfather, and was  present at the capitulation of Quebec in 1629.    [11] This is the river _de Fouez_ of Jacques Cartier, and the  _Metaberoutin_ of the Indians, and now the river St. Maurice, to which  historians have given the name of Three Rivers, because two islands  divide it into three branches at its entrance; these branches are called  _Les Chenaux_, or the narrow channels.    [12] Pierre de Chauvin, Sieur de la Pierre, called Captain Pierre by  Champlain, was born at Dieppe, but after the death of his relative,  Pierre de Chauvin, Sieur de Tontuit, he resided at Honfleur. There were  many families of Chauvin in Normandy during the seventeenth century,  notably the Chauvins, Sieurs de Tontuit, and the Chauvins, Sieurs de la  Pierre.          CHAPTER IV    CHAMPLAIN'S VOYAGES OF 1610, 1611, 1613      Champlain embarked at Honfleur with eleven artisans for Quebec, on March  7th, 1610. The rough weather experienced during the first days of the  voyage rendered it necessary for the vessel to run into Portland, on the  English coast, and later to seek refuge in the harbour of the Isle of  Wight. At this time Champlain was taken suddenly ill, and was obliged to  return by boat to Havre de Grace to undergo medical treatment. A month  after he rejoined his former vessel, which in the meantime had returned  to Honfleur to take in ballast. Champlain had now somewhat recovered,  although he was still weak and ill.    The vessel left Honfleur on April 8th, and reached Tadousac on the 26th  of the same month; which was one of the shortest passages ever made up  to that time. \"There were vessels,\" says Champlain, \"which had arrived  on the 18th of the month, a thing which had not been seen for more than  sixty years, as the old mariners said who sail regularly to this  country.\" This remark proves that for more than half a century French  fishermen and navigators had been accustomed to proceed as far as  Tadousac. A Basque, named Lavalette, who had been accustomed to fish on  the Acadian coast from about the year 1565, also confirms the statement.    On his arrival at Tadousac, Champlain ascertained from a young nobleman,  named du Parc,[13] who had wintered with Chauvin at Quebec, that all the  settlers were in good health, and that only a few of them had been  slightly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],[0,"The House of the Vampire (#9)"],[1,"  Ernest's attention.    \"What do you see?\" he asked quickly.    \"Nothing,\" Reginald replied, with immovable calm, \"only that your state  of nerves is still far from satisfactory.\"          XVIII      After Ernest's departure Ethel Brandenbourg's heart was swaying hither  and thither in a hurricane of conflicting feelings. Before she had time  to gain an emotional equilibrium, his letter had hurled her back into  chaos. A false ring somewhere in Ernest's words, reechoing with an  ever-increasing volume of sound, stifled the voice of love. His jewelled  sentences glittered, but left her cold. They lacked that spontaneity  which renders even simple and hackeneyed phrases wonderful and unique.  Ethel clearly realised that her hold upon the boy's imagination had been  a fleeting midsummer night's charm, and that a word from Reginald's lips  had broken the potency of her spell. She almost saw the shadow of  Reginald's visage hovering over Ernest's letter and leering at her from  between the lines in sinister triumph. Finally reason came and  whispered to her that it was extremely unwise to give her heart into the  keeping of a boy. His love, she knew, would have been exacting,  irritating at times. He would have asked her to sympathise with every  phase of his life, and would have expected active interest on her part  in much that she had done with long ago. Thus, untruth would have stolen  into her life and embittered it. When mates are unequal, Love must paint  its cheeks and, in certain moods at least, hide its face under a mask.  Its lips may be honeyed, but it brings fret and sorrow in its train.    These things she told herself over and over again while she penned a  cool and calculating answer to Ernest's letter. She rewrote it many  times, and every time it became more difficult to reply. At last she put  her letter aside for a few days, and when it fell again into her hand it  seemed so unnatural and strained that she destroyed it.    Thus several weeks had passed, and Ernest no longer exclusively occupied  her mind when, one day early in September, while glancing over a  magazine, she came upon his name in the table of contents. Once more  she saw the boy's wistful face before her, and a trembling something  stirred in her heart. Her hand shook as she cut the pages, and a mist of  tears clouded her vision as she attempted to read his poem. It was a  piece of sombre brilliance. Like black-draped monks half crazed with  mystic devotion, the poet's thoughts flitted across the page. It was the  wail of a soul that feels reason slipping from it and beholds madness  rise over its life like a great pale moon. A strange unrest emanated  from it and took possession of her. And again, with an insight that was  prophetic, she distinctly recognised behind the vague fear that had  haunted the poet the figure of Reginald Clarke.    A half-forgotten dream, struggling to consciousness, staggered her by  its vividness. She saw Clarke as she had seen him in days gone by,  grotesquely transformed into a slimy sea-thing, whose hungry mouths shut  sucking upon her and whose thousand tentacles encircled her form. She  closed her eyes in horror at the reminiscence. And in that moment it  became clear to her that she must take into her hands the salvation of  Ernest Fielding from the clutches of the malign power that had  mysteriously enveloped his life.          XIX      The summer was brief, and already by the middle of September many had  returned to the pleasures of urban life. Ethel was among the  first-comers; for, after her resolve to enter the life of the young poet  once more, it would have been impossible for her to stay away from the  city much longer. Her plan was all ready. Before attempting to see  Ernest she would go to meet Reginald and implore him to free the boy  from his hideous spell. An element of curiosity unconsciously entered  her determination. When, years ago, she and Clarke had parted, the man  had seemed, for once, greatly disturbed and had promised, in his  agitation, that some day he would communicate to her what would  exonerate him in her eyes. She had answered that all words between them  were purposeless, and that she hoped never to see his face again. The  experience that the years had brought to her, instead of elucidating  the mystery of Reginald's personality, had, on the contrary, made his  behaviour appear more and more unaccountable. She had more than once  caught herself wishing to meet him again and to analyse dispassionately  the puzzling influences he had exerted upon her. And she could at last  view him dispassionately; there was triumph in that. She was dimly aware  that something had passed from her, something by which he had held her,  and without which his magnetism was unable to play upon her.    So when Walkham sent her an invitation to one of his artistic \"at homes\"  she accepted, in the hope of meeting Reginald. It was his frequentation  of Walkham's house that had for several years effectively barred her  foot from crossing the threshold. It was with a very strange feeling she  greeted the many familiar faces at Walkham's now; and when, toward ten  o'clock, Reginald entered, politely bowing in answer to the welcome from  all sides, her heart beat in her like a drum. But she calmed herself,  and, catching his eye, so arranged it that early in the evening they  met in an alcove of the drawing-room.    \"It was inevitable,\" Reginald said. \"I expected it.\"    \"Yes,\" she replied, \"we were bound to meet.\"    Like a great rush of water, memory came back to her. He was still  horribly fascinating as of old--only she was no longer susceptible to  his fascination. He had changed somewhat in those years. The lines about  his mouth had grown harder and a steel-like look had come into his eyes.  Only for a moment, as he looked at her, a flash of tenderness seemed to  come back to them. Then he said, with a touch of sadness: \"Why should  the first word between us be a lie?\"    Ethel made no answer.    Reginald looked at her half in wonder and said: \"And is your love for  the boy so great that it overcame your hate of me?\"    Ah, he knew! She winced.    \"He has told you?\"    \"Not a word.\"    There was something superhuman in his power of penetration. Why should  she wear a mask before him, when his eyes, like the eyes of God, pierced  to the core of her being?    \"No,\" she replied, \"it is not love, but compassion for him.\"    \"Compassion?\"    \"Yes, compassion for your victim.\"    \"You mean?\"    \"Reginald!\"    \"I am all ear.\"    \"I implore you.\"    \"Speak.\"    \"You have ruined one life.\"    He raised his eyebrows derogatively.    \"Yes,\" she continued fiercely, \"ruined it! Is not that enough?\"    \"I have never wilfully ruined any one's life.\"    \"You have ruined mine.\"    \"Wilfully?\"    \"How else shall I explain your conduct?\"    \"I warned you.\"    \"Warning, indeed! The warning that the snake gives to the sparrow  helpless under its gaze.\"    \"Ah, but who tells you that the snake is to blame? Is it not rather the  occult power that prescribes with blood on brazen scroll the law of our  being?\"    \"This is no solace to the sparrow. But whatever may be said, let us drop  the past. Let us consider the present. I beg of you, leave this boy--let  him develop without your attempting to stifle the life in him or  impressing upon it the stamp of your alien mind.\"    \"Ethel,\" he protested, \"you are unjust. If you knew--\" Then an idea  seemed to take hold of him. He looked at her curiously.    \"What if I knew?\" she asked.    \"You shall know,\" he said, simply. \"Are you strong?\"    \"Strong to withstand anything at your hand. There is nothing that you  can give me, nothing that you can take away.\"    \"No,\" he remarked, \"nothing. Yes, you have changed. Still, when I look  upon you, the ghosts of the past seem to rise like live things.\"    \"We both have changed. We meet now upon equal grounds. You are no  longer the idol I made of you.\"    \"Don't you think that to the idol this might be a relief, not a  humiliation? It is a terrible torture to sit in state with lips  eternally shut. Sometimes there comes over the most reticent of us a  desire to break through the eternal loneliness that surrounds the soul.  It is this feeling that prompts madmen to tear off their clothes and  exhibit their nakedness in the market-place. It's madness on my part, or  a whim, or I don't know what; but it pleases me that you should know the  truth.\"    \"You promised me long ago that I should.\"    \"To-day I will redeem my promise, and I will tell you another thing that  you will find hard to believe.\"    \"And that is?\"    \"That I loved you.\"    Ethel smiled a little sceptically. \"You have loved often.\"    \"No,\" he replied. \"Loved, seriously loved, I have, only once.\"          XX      They were sitting in a little Italian restaurant where they had often,  in the old days, lingered late into the night over a glass of Lacrimae  Christi. But no pale ghost of the past rose from the wine. Only a  wriggling something, with serpent eyes, that sent cold shivers down her  spine and held her speechless and entranced.    When their order had been filled and the waiter had posted himself at a  respectful distance, Reginald began--at first leisurely, a man of the  world. But as he proceeded a strange exultation seemed to possess him  and from his eyes leaped the flame of the mystic.    \"You must pardon me,\" he commenced, \"if I monopolise the conversation,  but the revelations I have to make are of such a nature that I may well  claim your attention. I will start with my earliest childhood. You  remember the picture of me that was taken when I was five?\"    She remembered, indeed. Each detail of his life was deeply engraven on  her mind.    \"At that time,\" he continued, \"I was not held to be particularly bright.  The reason was that my mind, being pre-eminently and extraordinarily  receptive, needed a stimulus from without. The moment I was"]]]
