Nobody on board was prepared to defend the ship. It was the same old  story; resting quietly in a peaceful harbor, what danger had they to  expect? As usual the pirates had everything their own way; they were  ready to fight, and the others were not, and they were led by a man who  was determined to take that ship without giving even a thought to the  ordinary alternative of dying in the attempt. The affair was more of a  massacre than a combat, and there were people on board who did not know  what was taking place until the vessel had been captured.    As soon as Bartholemy was master of the great vessel he gave orders to  slip the cable and hoist the sails, for he was anxious to get out of  that harbor as quickly as possible. The fight had apparently attracted  no attention in the town, but there were ships in the port whose company  the bold buccaneer did not at all desire, and as soon as possible he got  his grand prize under way and went sailing out of the port.    Now, indeed, was Bartholemy triumphant; the ship he had captured was a  finer one and a richer one than that other vessel which had been taken  from him. It was loaded with valuable merchandise, and we may here  remark that for some reason or other all Spanish vessels of that day  which were so unfortunate as to be taken by pirates, seemed to be richly  laden.    If our bold pirate had sung wild pirate songs, as he passed the flowing  bowl while carousing with his crew in the cabin of the Spanish vessel he  had first captured, he now sang wilder songs, and passed more flowing  bowls, for this prize was a much greater one than the first. If  Bartholemy could have communicated his great good fortune to the other  buccaneers in the West Indies, there would have been a boom in piracy  which would have threatened great danger to the honesty and integrity of  the seafaring men of that region.    But nobody, not even a pirate, has any way of finding out what is going  to happen next, and if Bartholemy had had an idea of the fluctuations  which were about to occur in the market in which he had made his  investments he would have been in a great hurry to sell all his stock  very much below par. The fluctuations referred to occurred on the ocean,  near the island of Pinos, and came in the shape of great storm waves,  which blew the Spanish vessel with all its rich cargo, and its  triumphant pirate crew, high up upon the cruel rocks, and wrecked it  absolutely and utterly. Bartholemy and his men barely managed to get  into a little boat, and row themselves away. All the wealth and  treasure which had come to them with the capture of the Spanish vessel,  all the power which the possession of that vessel gave them, and all the  wild joy which came to them with riches and power, were lost to them in  as short a space of time as it had taken to gain them.    In the way of well-defined and conspicuous ups and downs, few lives  surpassed that of Bartholemy Portuguez. But after this he seems, in the  language of the old English song, \"All in the downs.\" He had many  adventures after the desperate affair in the bay of Campeachy, but they  must all have turned out badly for him, and, consequently, very well, it  is probable, for divers and sundry Spanish vessels, and, for the rest of  his life, he bore the reputation of an unfortunate pirate. He was one of  those men whose success seemed to have depended entirely upon his own  exertions. If there happened to be the least chance of his doing  anything, he generally did it; Spanish cannon, well-armed Spanish crews,  manacles, imprisonment, the dangers of the ocean to a man who could not  swim, bloodhounds, alligators, wild beasts, awful forests impenetrable  to common men, all these were bravely met and triumphed over by  Bartholemy.    But when he came to ordinary good fortune, such as any pirate might  expect, Bartholemy the Portuguese found that he had no chance at all.  But he was not a common pirate, and was, therefore, obliged to be  content with his uncommon career. He eventually settled in the island of  Jamaica, but nobody knows what became of him. If it so happened that he  found himself obliged to make his living by some simple industry, such  as the selling of fruit upon a street corner, it is likely he never  disposed of a banana or an orange unless he jumped at the throat of a  passer-by and compelled him to purchase. As for sitting still and  waiting for customers to come to him, such a man as Bartholemy would not  be likely to do anything so commonplace.          Chapter IX    A Pirate Author      In the days which we are considering there were all sorts of pirates,  some of whom gained much reputation in one way and some in another, but  there was one of them who had a disposition different from that of any  of his fellows. He was a regular pirate, but it is not likely that he  ever did much fighting, for, as he took great pride in the brave deeds  of the Brethren of the Coast, he would have been sure to tell us of his  own if he had ever performed any. He was a mild-mannered man, and,  although he was a pirate, he eventually laid aside the pistol, the  musket, and the cutlass, and took up the pen,--a very uncommon weapon  for a buccaneer.    This man was John Esquemeling, supposed by some to be a Dutchman, and by  others a native of France. He sailed to the West Indies in the year  1666, in the service of the French West India Company. He went out as a  peaceable merchant clerk, and had no more idea of becoming a pirate  than he had of going into literature, although he finally did both.    At that time the French West India Company had a colonial establishment  on the island of Tortuga, which was principally inhabited, as we have  seen before, by buccaneers in all their various grades and stages, from  beef-driers to pirates. The French authorities undertook to supply these  erratic people with the goods and provisions which they needed, and  built storehouses with everything necessary for carrying on the trade.  There were plenty of purchasers, for the buccaneers were willing to buy  everything which could be brought from Europe. They were fond of good  wine, good groceries, good firearms, and ammunition, fine cutlasses, and  very often good clothes, in which they could disport themselves when on  shore. But they had peculiar customs and manners, and although they were  willing to buy as much as the French traders had to sell, they could not  be prevailed upon to pay their bills. A pirate is not the sort of a man  who generally cares to pay his bills. When he gets goods in any way, he  wants them charged to him, and if that charge includes the features of  robbery and murder, he will probably make no objection. But as for  paying good money for what is received, that is quite another thing.    That this was the state of feeling on the island of Tortuga was  discovered before very long by the French mercantile agents, who then  applied to the mother country for assistance in collecting the debts due  them, and a body of men, who might be called collectors, or deputy  sheriffs, was sent out to the island; but although these officers were  armed with pistols and swords, as well as with authority, they could do  nothing with the buccaneers, and after a time the work of endeavoring to  collect debts from pirates was given up. And as there was no profit in  carrying on business in this way, the mercantile agency was also given  up, and its officers were ordered to sell out everything they had on  hand, and come home. There was, therefore, a sale, for which cash  payments were demanded, and there was a great bargain day on the island  of Tortuga. Everything was disposed of,--the stock of merchandise on  hand, the tables, the desks, the stationery, the bookkeepers, the  clerks, and the errand boys. The living items of the stock on hand were  considered to be property just as if they had been any kind of  merchandise, and were sold as slaves.    Now poor John Esquemeling found himself in a sad condition. He was  bought by one of the French officials who had been left on the island,  and he described his new master as a veritable fiend. He was worked  hard, half fed, treated cruelly in many ways, and to add to his misery,  his master tantalized him by offering to set him free upon the payment  of a sum of money equal to about three hundred dollars. He might as well  have been asked to pay three thousand or three million dollars, for he  had not a penny in the world.    At last he was so fortunate as to fall sick, and his master, as  avaricious as he was cruel, fearing that this creature he owned might  die, and thus be an entire loss to him, sold him to a surgeon, very much  as one would sell a sick horse to a veterinary surgeon, on the principle  that he might make something out of the animal by curing him.    His new master treated Esquemeling very well, and after he had taken  medicine and food enough to set him upon his legs, and had worked for  the surgeon about a year, that kind master offered him his liberty if he  would promise, as soon as he could earn the money, to pay him one  hundred dollars, which would be a profit to his owner, who had paid but  seventy dollars for him. This offer, of course, Esquemeling accepted  with delight, and having made the bargain, he stepped forth upon the  warm sands of the island of Tortuga a free and happy man. But he was as  poor as a church mouse. He had nothing in the world but the clothes on  his back, and he saw no way in which he could make money enough to keep  himself alive until he had paid for himself. He tried various ways of  support, but there was no opening for a young business man in that  section of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#9)"],[1,"around.  A bound  file of The Publishers' Weekly to give her a smack of trade matters.  Jo's Boys in case she needs a little relaxation.  The Lays of Ancient  Rome and Austin Dobson to show her some good poetry.  I wonder if they  give them The Lays to read in school nowadays?  I have a horrible fear  they are brought up on the battle of Salamis and the brutal redcoats of  '76.  And now we'll be exceptionally subtle: we'll stick in a Robert  Chambers to see if she falls for it.\"    He viewed the shelf with pride.  \"Not bad,\" he said to himself.  \"I'll  just add this Leonard Merrick, Whispers about Women, to amuse her.  I  bet that title will start her guessing.  Helen will say I ought to have  included the Bible, but I'll omit it on purpose, just to see whether  the girl misses it.\"    With typical male curiosity he pulled out the bureau drawers to see  what disposition his wife had made of them, and was pleased to find a  little muslin bag of lavender dispersing a quiet fragrance in each.  \"Very nice,\" he remarked.  \"Very nice indeed!  About the only thing  missing is an ashtray.  If Miss Titania is as modern as some of them,  that'll be the first thing she'll call for.  And maybe a copy of Ezra  Pound's poems.  I do hope she's not what Helen calls a bolshevixen.\"      There was nothing bolshevik about a glittering limousine that drew up  at the corner of Gissing and Swinburne streets early that afternoon.  A  chauffeur in green livery opened the door, lifted out a suitcase of  beautiful brown leather, and gave a respectful hand to the vision that  emerged from depths of lilac-coloured upholstery.    \"Where do you want me to carry the bag, miss?\"    \"This is the bitter parting,\" replied Miss Titania.  \"I don't want you  to know my address, Edwards.  Some of my mad friends might worm it out  of you, and I don't want them coming down and bothering me.  I am going  to be very busy with literature.  I'll walk the rest of the way.\"    Edwards saluted with a grin--he worshipped the original young  heiress--and returned to his wheel.    \"There's one thing I want you to do for me,\" said Titania.  \"Call up my  father and tell him I'm on the job.\"    \"Yes, miss,\" said Edwards, who would have run the limousine into a  government motor truck if she had ordered it.    Miss Chapman's small gloved hand descended into an interesting purse  that was cuffed to her wrist with a bright little chain.  She drew out  a nickel--it was characteristic of her that it was a very bright and  engaging looking nickel--and handed it gravely to her charioteer.  Equally gravely he saluted, and the car, after moving through certain  dignified arcs, swam swiftly away down Thackeray Boulevard.    Titania, after making sure that Edwards was out of sight, turned up  Gissing Street with a fluent pace and an observant eye.  A small boy  cried, \"Carry your bag, lady?\" and she was about to agree, but then  remembered that she was now engaged at ten dollars a week and waved him  away.  Our readers would feel a justifiable grudge if we did not  attempt a description of the young lady, and we will employ the few  blocks of her course along Gissing Street for this purpose.    Walking behind her, the observer, by the time she had reached Clemens  Place, would have seen that she was faultlessly tailored in genial  tweeds; that her small brown boots were sheltered by spats of that pale  tan complexion exhibited by Pullman porters on the Pennsylvania  Railroad; that her person was both slender and vigorous; that her  shoulders were carrying a sumptuous fur of the colour described by the  trade as nutria, or possibly opal smoke.  The word chinchilla would  have occurred irresistibly to this observer from behind; he might also,  if he were the father of a family, have had a fleeting vision of many  autographed stubs in a check book.  The general impression that he  would have retained, had he turned aside at Clemens Place, would be  \"expensive, but worth the expense.\"    It is more likely, however, that the student of phenomena would have  continued along Gissing Street to the next corner, being that of  Hazlitt Street.  Taking advantage of opportunity, he would overtake the  lady on the pavement, with a secret, sidelong glance.  If he were wise,  he would pass her on the right side where her tilted bonnet permitted a  wider angle of vision.  He would catch a glimpse of cheek and chin  belonging to the category known (and rightly) as adorable; hair that  held sunlight through the dullest day; even a small platinum wrist  watch that might pardonably be excused, in its exhilarating career, for  beating a trifle fast.  Among the greyish furs he would note a bunch of  such violets as never bloom in the crude springtime, but reserve  themselves for November and the plate glass windows of Fifth Avenue.    It is probable that whatever the errand of this spectator he would have  continued along Gissing Street a few paces farther.  Then, with  calculated innocence, he would have halted halfway up the block that  leads to the Wordsworth Avenue \"L,\" and looked backward with carefully  simulated irresolution, as though considering some forgotten matter.  With apparently unseeing eyes he would have scanned the bright  pedestrian, and caught the full impact of her rich blue gaze.  He would  have seen a small resolute face rather vivacious in effect, yet with a  quaint pathos of youth and eagerness.  He would have noted the cheeks  lit with excitement and rapid movement in the bracing air.  He would  certainly have noted the delicate contrast of the fur of the wild  nutria with the soft V of her bare throat.  Then, to his surprise, he  would have seen this attractive person stop, examine her surroundings,  and run down some steps into a rather dingy-looking second-hand  bookshop.  He would have gone about his affairs with a new and  surprised conviction that the Almighty had the borough of Brooklyn  under His especial care.    Roger, who had conceived a notion of some rather peevish foundling of  the Ritz-Carlton lobbies and Central Park riding academies, was  agreeably amazed by the sweet simplicity of the young lady.    \"Is this Mr. Mifflin?\" she said, as he advanced all agog from his smoky  corner.    \"Miss Chapman?\" he replied, taking her bag.  \"Helen!\" he called.  \"Miss  Titania is here.\"    She looked about the sombre alcoves of the shop.  \"I do think it's  adorable of you to take me in,\" she said.  \"Dad has told me so much  about you.  He says I'm impossible.  I suppose this is the literature  he talks about.  I want to know all about it.\"    \"And here's Bock!\" she cried.  \"Dad says he's the greatest dog in the  world, named after Botticelli or somebody.  I've brought him a present.  It's in my bag.  Nice old Bocky!\"    Bock, who was unaccustomed to spats, was examining them after his own  fashion.    \"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"We are delighted to see you.  I  hope you'll be happy with us, but I rather doubt it.  Mr. Mifflin is a  hard man to get along with.\"    \"Oh, I'm sure of it!\" cried Titania.  \"I mean, I'm sure I shall be  happy!  You mustn't believe a word of what Dad says about me.  I'm  crazy about books.  I don't see how you can bear to sell them.  I  brought these violets for you, Mrs. Mifflin.\"    \"How perfectly sweet of you,\" said Helen, captivated already.  \"Come  along, we'll put them right in water.  I'll show you your room.\"    Roger heard them moving about overhead.  It suddenly occurred to him  that the shop was rather a dingy place for a young girl.  \"I wish I had  thought to get in a cash register,\" he mused.  \"She'll think I'm  terribly unbusiness-like.\"    \"Now,\" said Mrs. Mifflin, as she and Titania came downstairs again,  \"I'm making some pastry, so I'm going to turn you over to your  employer.  He can show you round the shop and tell you where all the  books are.\"    \"Before we begin,\" said Titania, \"just let me give Bock his present.\"  She showed a large package of tissue paper and, unwinding innumerable  layers, finally disclosed a stalwart bone.  \"I was lunching at  Sherry's, and I made the head waiter give me this.  He was awfully  amused.\"    \"Come along into the kitchen and give it to him,\" said Helen.  \"He'll  be your friend for life.\"    \"What an adorable kennel!\" cried Titania, when she saw the remodelled  packing-case that served Bock as a retreat.  The bookseller's ingenious  carpentry had built it into the similitude of a Carnegie library, with  the sign READING-ROOM over the door; and he had painted imitation  book-shelves along the interior.    \"You'll get used to Mr. Mifflin after a while,\" said Helen amusedly.  \"He spent all one winter getting that kennel fixed to his liking.  You  might have thought he was going to live in it instead of Bock.  All the  titles that he painted in there are books that have dogs in them, and a  lot of them he made up.\"    Titania insisted on getting down to peer inside.  Bock was much  flattered at this attention from the new planet that had swum into his  kennel.    \"Gracious!\" she said, \"here's 'The Rubaiyat of Omar Canine.' I do think  that's clever!\"    \"Oh, there are a lot more,\" said Helen.  \"The works of Bonar Law, and  Bohn's 'Classics,' and 'Catechisms on Dogma' and goodness knows what.  If Roger paid half as much attention to business as he does to jokes of  that sort, we'd be rich.  Now, you run along and have a look at the  shop.\"    Titania found the bookseller at his desk.  \"Here I am, Mr. Mifflin,\"  she said.  \"See, I brought a nice sharp pencil along with me to make  out sales slips.  I've been practicing sticking it in my hair.  I can  do it quite nicely now.  I hope you have some of those big red books  with all the carbon paper in them and everything.  I've been watching  the girls up at Lord and Taylor's make them out, and I think they're  fascinating.  And you must teach me to run the elevator.  I'm awfully  keen about elevators.\"    \"Bless me,\" said Roger, \"You'll"]]]
