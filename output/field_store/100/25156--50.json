In general, it is more  difficult to decide whether a mental trait is germinal, than whether a  physical one is; and great care should be used in classification.    To make the distinction, one ought to be familiar with an individual  from birth, and to have some knowledge of the conditions to which he was  exposed, in the period between conception and birth,--for of course a  modification which takes place during that time is as truly an acquired  character as one that takes place after parturition. Blindness, for  example, may be an inborn defect. The child from conception may have  lacked the requisites for the development of sight. On the other hand,  it may be an acquired character, due to an ill-advised display of  patriotism on July 4, at some time during childhood; or even to  infection at the moment of birth. Similarly small size may be an inborn  character, due to a small-sized ancestry; but if the child comes of a  normal ancestry and is stunted merely because of lack of proper care and  food, the smallness is an acquired character. Deafness may be congenital  and inborn, or it may be acquired as the result, say, of scarlet fever  during childhood.    Now the inborn characters (excepting modifications _in utero_) are  admittedly heritable, for inborn characters must exist potentially in  the germ-plasm. The belief that acquired characters are also inherited,  therefore, involves belief that in some way the trait acquired by the  parent is incorporated in the germ-plasm of the parent, to be handed on  to the child and reappear in the course of the child's development. The  impress on the parental _body_ must in some way be transferred to the  parental _germ-plasm_; and not as a general influence, but as a specific  one which can be reproduced by the germ-plasm.    This idea was held almost without question by the biologists of the  past, from Aristotle on. Questionings indeed arose from time to time,  but they were vague and carried no weight, until a generation ago  several able men elaborated them. For many years, it was the question of  chief dispute in the study of heredity. The last word has not yet been  said on it. It has theoretical bearings of immense importance; for our  conception of the process of evolution will be shaped according to the  belief that acquired characters are or are not inherited. Herbert  Spencer went so far as to say, \"Close contemplation of the facts  impresses me more strongly than ever with two alternatives--either that  there has been inheritance of acquired characters, or there has been no  evolution.\" But its practical bearings are no less momentous. Again to  quote Spencer: \"Considering the width and depth of the effects which the  acceptance or non-acceptance of one or the other of these hypotheses  must have on our views of life, the question, Which of them is true?  demands beyond all other questions whatever the attention of scientific  men. A grave responsibility rests on biologists in respect of the  general question, since wrong answers lead, among other effects, to  wrong belief about social affairs and to disastrous social actions.\"    Biologists certainly have not shirked this \"grave responsibility\" during  the last 30 years, and they have, in our opinion, satisfactorily  answered the general question. The answer they give is not the answer  Herbert Spencer gave.    But the popular mind frequently lags a generation behind, in its grasp  of the work of science, and it must be said that in this case the  popular mind is still largely under the influence of Herbert Spencer and  his school. _Whether they know it or not_, most people who have not made  a particular study of the question still tacitly assume that the  acquirements of one generation form part of the inborn heritage of the  next, and the present social and educational systems are founded in  large part on this false foundation. Most philanthropy starts out  unquestioningly with the assumption that by modifying the individual for  the better, it will thereby improve the germinal quality of the race.  Even a self-styled eugenist asks, \"Can prospective parents who have  thoroughly and systematically disciplined themselves, physically,  mentally and morally, transmit to their offspring the traits or  tendencies which they have developed?\" and answers the question with the  astounding statement, \"It seems reasonable to suppose that they have  this power, it being simply a phase of heredity, the tendency of like to  beget like.\"    The right understanding of this famous problem is therefore fraught with  the most important consequences to eugenics. The huge mass of  experimental evidence that has been accumulated during the last quarter  of a century has, necessarily, been almost wholly based on work with  plants and lower animals. Even though we can not attempt to present a  general review of this evidence, for which the reader must consult one  of the standard works on biology or genetics, we shall point out some of  the considerations underlying the problem and its solution.    In the first place, it must be definitely understood that we are dealing  only with specific, as distinguished from general, transmission. As the  germ-cells derive their nourishment from the body, it is obvious that  any cause profoundly affecting the latter might in that way exercise an  influence on the germ-cells; that if the parent was starved, the  germ-cells might be ill-nourished and the resulting offspring might be  weak and puny. There is experimental evidence that this is the case; but  that is not the inheritance of an acquired character. If, however, a  white man tanned by long exposure to the tropical sun should have  children who were brunettes, when the family stock was all blond; or if  men whose legs were deformed through falls in childhood should have  children whose legs, at birth, appeared deformed in the same manner;  then there would be a distinct case of the transmission of an acquired  characteristic. \"The precise question,\" as Professor Thomson words it,  \"is this: Can a structural change in the body, induced by some change in  use or disuse, or by a change in surrounding influence, affect the  germ-cells in such a _specific_ or representative way that the offspring  will through its inheritance exhibit, even in a slight degree, the  modification which the parent acquired?\" He then lists a number of  current misunderstandings, which are so widespread that they deserve to  be considered here.    (1) It is frequently argued (as Herbert Spencer himself suggested) that  unless modifications are inherited, there could be no such thing as  evolution. Such pessimism is unwarranted. There _is_ abundant  explanation of evolution, in the abundant supply of germinal variations  which every individual presents.    (2) It is common to advance an _interpretation_ of some observation, in  support of the Lamarckian doctrine, as if it were a _fact_.  Interpretations are not facts. What is wanted are the facts; each  student has a right to interpret them as he sees fit, but not to  represent his interpretation as a fact. It is easy to find structural  features in Nature which _may be interpreted_ as resulting from the  inheritance of acquired characters; but this is not the same as to say  and to prove that they _have resulted_ from such inheritance.    (3) It is common to beg the question by pointing to the transmission of  some character that is not proved to be a modification. Herbert Spencer  cited the prevalence of short-sightedness among the \"notoriously  studious\" Germans as a defect due to the inheritance of an acquired  character. But he offered no evidence that this is an acquirement rather  than a germinal character. As a fact, there is reason to believe that  weakness of the eyes is one of the characteristics of that race, and  existed long before the Germans ever became studious--even at a time  when most of them could neither read nor write.    (4) The reappearance of a modification may be mistaken for the  transmission of a modification. Thus a blond European family moves to  the tropics, and the parents become tanned. The children who grow up  under the tropical sun are tanned from infancy; and after the  grandchildren or great-grandchildren appear, brown from childhood, some  one points to the case as an instance of permanent modification of  skin-color. But of course the children at the time of birth are as white  as their distant cousins in Europe, and if taken back to the North to be  brought up, would be no darker than their kinsmen who had never been in  the tropics. Such \"evidence\" has often been brought forward by careless  observers, but can deceive no one who inquires carefully into the facts.    (5) In the case of diseases, re-infection is often mistaken for  transmission. The father had pneumonia; the son later developed it;  ergo, he must have inherited it. What evidence is there that the son in  this case did not get it from an entirely different source? Medical  literature is heavily burdened with such spurious evidence.    (6) Changes in the germ-cells _along with_ changes in the body are not  relevant to this discussion. The mother's body, for example, is poisoned  with alcohol, which is present in large quantities in the blood and  therefore might affect the germ-cells directly. If the children  subsequently born are consistently defective it is not an inheritance of  a body character but the result of a direct modification of the  germ-plasm. The inheritance of an acquired modification of the body can  only be proved if some particular change made in the parent is inherited  as such by the child.    (7) There is often a failure to distinguish between the possible  inheritance of a particular modification, and the possible inheritance  of indirect results of that modification, or of changes correlated with  it.

Professor Lange, give us the news from the  seat of war!\"    A window on the first floor was hastily opened, and the pale, frightened  face of a gentleman looked out. \"What do you want to see me for?\" asked  a tremulous and hollow voice. \"Why do you mention the _Telegraph_?\"    \"We want news from the army! We want to know whether it is true that we  have lost a battle!\"    \"God forbid!\" said the gentleman at the window. \"I have not received any  news whatever for the last three days; I know only one thing, and that  is, that Cabinet Counsellor Lombard, who was at the headquarters of the  army in Weimar, returned last night to Berlin, and is now at his  residence. Counsellor Lombard, therefore, would be the man to whom you  ought to apply.\"    \"Lombard! Lombard!\" shouted the crowd, accompanying the name with bitter  imprecations. When this name was heard, all faces turned gloomy, and  every voice assumed an angry and threatening tone.    \"Lombard is to blame for every thing!\" grumbled a few here and there,  and \"Lombard is to blame for every thing!\" was repeated louder and  louder. The excitement was as when a storm, sweeping over the sea,  lashes its waves, until, rising higher and higher, they foam with fury.    \"Lombard sides with the French!\" reiterated the surging mass. \"He has  secretly informed the enemy of all the operations of our army, and if  the Prussians are defeated, he will be glad of it. We will go to  Lombard, and he must tell us all he knows. But woe to him if the news  should be bad!\"    And the multitude with savage yells hastened down the street, back to  the Linden, and toward the residence of Cabinet Counsellor Lombard.    All the window-blinds of his house were closed, as they had been for the  last two weeks, since this well-known favorite of Minister von Haugwitz  had repaired to the headquarters of the army at Weimar. But Professor  Lange had stated, perhaps for the sole purpose of diverting the general  attention from himself, and of directing it toward the unpopular cabinet  counsellor, that Lombard had returned, and the people believed him.    \"Lombard! Lombard!\" shouted hundreds of voices. Eyes which had hitherto  looked only sad and anxious became threatening; many a fist was lifted  up to the closed windows, and many an imprecation uttered.    \"If a disaster has taken place, it is Lombard's fault,\" cried one of the  crowd.    \"If it is his fault, he shall and must atone for it,\" exclaimed another.    \"He has no heart for Prussia's honor,\" said a third. \"He is a  German-Frenchman, and would not object if the whole of Prussia should  become a French province. If he knew how to do it, he certainly would  not shrink from it, even should he bring captivity and distress upon the  king and the queen!\"    \"He has already done much mischief,\" shouted another. \"The Russian army  which was to support ours ought to have been here long ago, but he  detained the dispatches in which the king informed the czar that our  army had advanced against the French. It is his fault that the Russians  have not yet arrived.\"    \"It is his fault that the Russians have not yet arrived!\" roared the  wild chorus, and the furious men began to rush toward the house. Many  armed themselves with stones, hurled them at the walls and broke the  windows; others commenced striking with vigorous fists at the closed  door.    \"Open the door! open the door! We want to see Lombard! He shall account  for what he has done!\" exclaimed the enraged men. \"Woe to him if it be  true that we have lost a battle! Woe to him if--\"    \"Silence! silence!\" suddenly thundered a loud, imperious voice. \"See,  there is a courier!\"    \"A courier! A courier!\" and all rushed back from the house into the  street; every eye turned toward the horseman, who approached at full  gallop.    As if obeying a military command, the multitude made way for him, but at  every step they closed behind him, and, pressing him on all sides, his  progress was exceedingly slow.    But the courier, with his gloomy mien and pale cheeks, looked like a  bearer of bad news, and when the people had scanned his features, they  murmured, \"He brings bad news! A disaster is written on his forehead!\"    \"Let me pass,\" he said in an imploring voice; \"in the name of the king,  let me pass!\" And as he spurred his horse, the bystanders fell back in  alarm.    \"'In the name of the king!' the king, then, is still alive?\"    \"Yes, the king is alive!\" replied the courier, sadly. \"I have dispatches  from him for the Governor of Berlin and Cabinet Counsellor Lombard.\"    \"And what do these dispatches contain?\" asked a thousand voices.    \"I do not know, and even though I did, I am not at liberty to tell you.  The governor will communicate the news to the inhabitants of Berlin.\"    \"Tell us the news!\" demanded the people.    \"I cannot do so; and, moreover, I do not know any thing about it,\"  replied the courier, who had now reached Lombard's house, and whose  horse was again so closely surrounded that it was scarcely able to move  its feet.    \"Do not detain me, my friends, I beseech you--let me dismount here,\"  said the courier. \"I must deliver my dispatches to Cabinet Counsellor  Lombard.\"    \"Oh, let him deliver his dispatches. We can afterward compel M. Lombard  to communicate their contents.\"    \"Yes; let him deliver his dispatches,\" said all; \"Lombard shall  presently tell us what they contain.\"    The crowd stood back on both sides of the door, and busy hands were  ready to assist the rider in dismounting. But before he had been able to  do so, a voice from the rear was heard: \"Ask him where the queen is at  present!\"    \"Yes, yes, where is the queen? where is the queen?\"    \"The queen?\" said he. \"I passed her fifteen minutes ago near the city  and delivered dispatches to her, too. The queen? Look there!\" And he  pointed to the Brandenburg gate.    A carriage, drawn by six horses, was seen rapidly approaching.    \"The queen! It is the queen!\" joyfully shouted every one, and the  thousands who had been a moment before so anxious to learn the news, and  to call Lombard to account, rushed toward the carriage. Meantime the  courier, whose presence seemed to be entirely forgotten, dismounted, and  rapped softly at the door. It was at once opened in a cautious manner,  and a voice whispered: \"Take your horse into the house. You can  afterward ride through the garden, and out of the back gate to the  governor's residence.\"    The door was hastily thrown open, and closed as soon as the courier had  entered with his horse. No notice was taken of this movement, for every  one thought only of the queen, and looked anxiously through the closed  coach windows.    \"The queen! It is the queen!\" exclaimed the people, greeting the beloved  lady in the most rapturous manner. All arms were raised in sign of  respect, and every voice uttered a welcome of \"Long live the queen!\"    The carriage window was lowered, and Louisa's beautiful face appeared;  but she looked pale and afflicted; her eyes, generally so radiant,  seemed dimmed and tearful; yet she tried to smile, and bowed repeatedly  to her enthusiastic friends, who rushed impetuously toward her, and, in  their exultation, forgetful of the rules of etiquette, seized the reins  and stopped the horses.    \"We want to see our queen! Long live our Queen Louisa!\" cried thousands  of voices. Those who stood nearest the carriage, and beheld her  countenance, fell on their knees in the fervor of their love, and eyes  that never before had wept were filled with tears; for she seemed as an  angel of sorrow and suffering. She rose, and, leaning out of the coach  door, returned the affectionate greetings of her faithful subjects, and,  weeping, stretched out her arms as if to bless them.    \"Long live the queen! Long live Louisa!\" they cried, and those who held  the horses, in order to stop the carriage, dropped the reins, rushed  toward the coach door, threw up their hats, and joined in the welcome  cry. The coachman, profiting by this movement, drove onward. The people,  whose desire had been satisfied in having seen their queen, no longer  resisted, and permitted the carriage to roll away.    Louisa closed her coach window, and, sinking back upon the cushions,  exclaimed in a heart-rending tone, \"Alas! it is perhaps the last time  that they thus salute me! Soon, perhaps, I shall be no longer Queen of  Prussia!\" She buried her face in her hands, and sobbed aloud.    \"Do not weep,\" whispered Madame von Berg, the queen's intimate friend,  who was sitting by her side, \"do not weep. It may be a dispensation of  Providence that the crown shall fall from your head for a moment, but He  will replace it more firmly, and one day you will again be happy.\"    \"Oh, it is not for the sake of my own majesty, and for my little worldly  splendor, that I am lamenting at this moment,\" said the queen, removing  her hands from her face. \"I should gladly plunge into obscurity and  death if my husband and my children were exempted from humiliation, and  if these good people, who love me, and are attached to their king,  should not be compelled to recognize a foreigner as their master, and  bow to him!\"    \"Even though the people should be subjugated at present,\" said Madame  von Berg, solemnly, \"they will rise one day and avenge their disgrace!\"    \"Would you were a true prophetess!\" exclaimed Louisa. \"I hope the people  will remain faithful to us in adversity, and never forget their love for  their king! Yes, I will hope for that day, and pray that it may come  speedily. I will weep no more; but remember that I am a mother, and  shall see my children again--not to leave them, but to hasten with them  to my husband, who is waiting for me at"]]]
