But I'll be  billblowed if I'm going to let Christmas go by without saying something  about it in the window.\"    \"Night before Christmas'll be too late to advertise anything,\" said  Ebenezer. \"If I was in trade,\" he said, half closing his eyes, \"I'd fill  my window up with useful articles--caps and mittens and stockings and  warm underwear and dishes and toothbrushes. And I'd say: 'Might as well  afford these on what you saved out of Christmas.' You'd ought to get all  the advertising you can out of any situation.\"    Abel shook his head.    \"I ain't much on such,\" he said lightly--and then looked intently at  Ebenezer. \"Jenny's been buying quite a lot here for her Christmas,\" he  said.    Ebenezer was blank. \"Jenny?\" he said. \"Jenny Wing? I heard she was here.  I ain't seen her. Is she bound to keep Christmas anyhow?\"    \"Just white goods, it was,\" said Abel, briefly.    Ebenezer frowned his lack of understanding.    \"I shouldn't think her and Bruce had much of anything to buy anything  with,\" he said. \"I s'pose you know,\" he added, \"that Bruce, the young  beggar, quit working for me in the City after the--the failure? Threw up  his job with me, and took God knows what to do.\"    Abel nodded gravely. All Old Trail Town knew that, and honoured Bruce  for it.    \"Headstrong couple,\" Ebenezer added. \"So Jenny's bent on having  Christmas, no matter what the town decides, is she?\" he added, \"it's  like her, the minx.\"    \"I don't think it was planned that way,\" Abel said simply; \"she's only  buying white goods,\" he repeated. And, Ebenezer still staring, \"Surely  you know what Jenny's come home for?\" Abel said.    A moment or two later Ebenezer was out on the street again, his face  turned toward the factory. He was aware that Abel caught open the door  behind him and called after him, \"Whenever you get ready to sell me that  there star glass, you know....\" Ebenezer answered something, but his  responses were so often guttural and indistinguishable that his will to  reply was regarded as nominal, anyway. He also knew that now, just  before him, Buff Miles was proceeding with the snowplow, cutting a firm,  white way, smooth and sparkling for soft treading, momentarily bordered  by a feathery flux, that tumbled and heaped and then lay quiet in a  glitter of crystals. But his thought went on without these things and  without his will.    Bruce's baby! It would be a Rule, too.... the third generation, the  third generation. And accustomed as he was to relate every experience to  himself, measure it, value it by its own value to him, the effect of his  reflection was at first single: The third generation of Rules. _Was he  as old as that?_    It seemed only yesterday that Bruce had been a boy, in a blue necktie to  match his eyes, and shoes which for some reason he always put on wrong,  so that the buttons were on the inside. Bruce's baby. Good heavens! It  had been a shock when Bruce graduated from the high school, a shock when  he had married, but his baby ... it was incredible that he himself  should be so old as that.    ... This meant, then, that if Malcolm had lived, Malcolm might have had  a child now....    Ebenezer had not meant to think that. It was as if the Thought came and  spoke to him. He never allowed himself to think of that other life of  his, when his wife, Letty, and his son Malcolm had been living. Nobody  in Old Trail Town ever heard him speak of them or had ever been answered  when Ebenezer had been spoken to concerning them. A high white shaft in  the cemetery marked the two graves. All about them doors had been  closed. But with the thought of this third generation, the doors all  opened. He looked along ways that he had forgotten.    As he went he was unconscious, as he was always unconscious, of the  little street. He saw the market square, not as the heart of the town,  but as a place for buying and selling, and the little shops were to him  not ways of providing the town with life, but ways of providing their  keepers with a livelihood. Beyond these was a familiar setting, arranged  that day with white background and heaped roofs and laden boughs, the  houses standing side by side, like human beings. There they were, like  the chorus to the thing he was thinking about. They were all thinking  about it, too. Every one of them knew what he knew. Yet he never saw the  bond, but he thought they were only the places where men lived who had  been his factory hands and would be so yet if he had not cut them away:  Ben Torrey, shoveling off his front walk with his boy sweeping behind  him; August Muir, giving his little girl a ride on the snow shovel;  Nettie Hatch, clearing the ice out of her mail box, while her  sister--the lame one--watched from her chair by the window, interested  as in a real event. Ebenezer spoke to them from some outpost of  consciousness which his thought did not pass. The little street was not  there, as it was never there for him, as an entity. It was merely a  street. And the little town was not an entity. It was merely where he  lived. He went behind Buff Miles and the snowplow--as he always went--as  if space had been created for folk to live in one at a time, and as if  this were his own turn.    When he reached the bend from the Old Trail to the road where the  factory was, he understood at last that he had been hearing a song sung  over a great many times.        \"... One for the way it all begun,      Two for the way it all has run,      What three'll be for I do forget,      But what's to be has not been yet....      So holly and mistletoe,      So holly and mistletoe,      So holly and mistletoe,      Over and over and over, oh.\"    Buff, who was singing it, looked over his shoulder, and nodded.    \"They said you can't have no Christmas on Christmas Day,\" he observed,  grinning, \"but I ain't heard nothing to prevent singing Christmas carols  right up to the day that is the day.\"    Ebenezer halted.    \"How old are you?\" he abruptly demanded of Buff--whom he had known from  Buff's boyhood.    \"Thirty-three,\" said Buff, \"dum it.\"    \"You and Bruce about the same age, ain't you?\" said Ebenezer.    Buff nodded.    \"Well,\" said Ebenezer, \"well....\" and stood looking at him. Malcolm  would have been his age, too.    \"Going down to the factory, are you?\" Buff said. \"Wait a bit. I'll hike  on down ahead of you.\"    He turned the snowplow down the factory road, as if he were making a  triumphal progress, fashioning his snow borders with all the freedom of  some sculpturing wind on summer clouds.        \"One for the way it all begun,      Two for the way it all has run....\"    he sang to the soft push and thud and clank of his going. He swept a  circle in front of the little house that was the factory office, as if  he had prepared the setting for a great event; and Ebenezer, following  in the long, bright path, stepped into the hall of the house.    For thirty years he had been accustomed to enter the little house with  his mind ready to receive its interior of desks and shelves and safes  and files. To-day, quite unexpectedly, as he opened the door, the thing  that was in his mind was a hall stair with a red carpet, and a parlour  adjoining with figured stuff at the windows and a coal fire in the  stove.... And thirty-five years ago it had been that way, when he and  his wife and child had lived in the little house where his business was  then just starting at a machine set up in the woodshed. As his project  had grown and his factory had arisen in the neighbouring lots, the  family had moved farther up in the town. Remembrance had been divorced  from this place for decades. To-day, without warning, it waited for him  on the threshold.    He had asked his bookkeeper to meet him there, but the man had not yet  arrived. So Ebenezer himself kindled a fire in the rusty office stove,  in the room where the figured curtains had been. The old account books  that he wanted were not here on the shelves, nor in the cupboards of the  cold adjoining rooms. They dated so far back that they had been filed  away upstairs. He had not been upstairs in years, and his first impulse  was to send his bookkeeper, when he should appear. But this, after all,  was not Ebenezer's way; and he went up the stairs himself.    Each upper room was like some one unconscious in stupor or death, and  still as distinct in personality as if in some ancient activity. There  was the shelf he had put up in their room, the burned place on the floor  where he had tipped over a lamp, tattered shreds of the paper she had  hung to surprise him, the little storeroom which they had cleared out  for Malcolm when he was old enough, and whose door had had to be kept  closed because innumerable uncaged birds lived there....    When he had gone through the piles of account books in a closet and  those he sought were not found among them, he remembered the trunkful up  in the tiny loft. He let down from the passage ceiling the ladder he had  once hung there, and climbed up to the little roof recess.    Light entered through four broken panes of skylight. It fell in a faint  rug on the dusty floor. The roof sloped sharply, and the trunks and  boxes had been pressed back to the rim of the place. Ebenezer put his  hands out, groping. They touched an edge of something that swayed. He  laid hold of it and drew it out and set down on the faint rug of light  a small wooden hobbyhorse.    He stood staring at it, remembering it as clearly as if some one had set  before him the old white gate which he bestrode in his own boyhood. It  was Malcolm's hobbyhorse, dappled gray, the tail and the mane missing  and the paint worn off--and tenderly licked off--his nose. When they had  moved to the other house, he had bought the boy a pony, and this horse  had been left behind. Something else stirred in his memory, the name by  which Malcolm had used to call his hobbyhorse, some ringing name ... but  he had forgotten. He thrust the"]]]
