Sec. 26. And now when his Affection towards it was increas'd to the highest  degree, both upon the account of its Beneficial Effects, and its  Extraordinary Power; he began to think that the Substance which was  departed from the Heart of his Mother the Roe, was, if not the very same  with it, yet at least of a Nature very much like it. He was confirm'd in  his Opinion, because he had observ'd in all Animals, that as long as  they liv'd, they were constantly warm without any Intermission, and as  constantly Cold after Death, Besides he found in himself, that there was  a greater degree of Heat by much in his Breast, near that place where he  had made the Incision in the _Roe_. This made him think that if he could  dissect any Animal alive, and look into that Ventricle which he had  found empty when he dissected his Dam the _Roe_, he might possibly find  it full of that Substance which inhabited it, and so inform himself  whether it were of the Substance with the Fire, and whether it had any  Light or Heat in it or not. In order to this he took a Wild Beast and  ty'd him down, so that he could not stir, and dissected him after the  same manner he had dissected the _Roe_, till he came to the Heart; and  Essaying the left Ventricle first, and opening it, he perceiv'd it was  full of an Airy Vapour, which look'd like a little Mist or white Cloud,  and putting in his Finger, he found it hotter than he could well endure  it, and immediately the Creature Dyed. From whence he assuredly  concluded, that it was that Moist Vapour which communicated Motion to  that Animal, and that there was accordingly in every Animal of what kind  soever, something like it upon the departure of which Death follow'd.    Sec. 27. He had then a great desire to enquire into the other parts of  Animals, to find out their Order and Situation, their Quantity and the  manner of there Connexion one with another, and by what means of  Communication they enjoy the Benefit of that Moist Vapour, so as to live  by it. How that Vapour is continu'd the time it remains, from whence it  has its Supplies, and by what Means its Heat is preserv'd. The way which  he us'd in this Enquiry was the Dissection of all sorts of Animals, as  well Living as Dead, neither did he leave off to make an accurate  Enquiry into them, till at length he arrived to the highest degree of  Knowledge in this kind which the most Learned Naturalists ever attain'd  to.    Sec. 28. And now he Apprehended plainly that every particular Animal, tho'  it had a great many Limbs, and variety of Senses and Motions, was  nevertheless _One_ in respect of that Spirit, whose Original was from  one firm Mansion, _viz_. the Heart, from whence, its Influence was  diffus'd among all the Members. And that all the Members were  subservient to it, or inform'd and supported by it, and that this Spirit  made use of those Members, in the same manner as a Soldier do's of his  Weapons, or an Huntsman or Fisherman of his Tackling, who makes use of  different ways and things, according to the difference of the Creatures  he intends to catch. Now the Soldiers Weapons are some of 'em defensive  and offensive, and the Sportsman's too are some for Land, and some for  Water: So the Anatomists Instruments, are some for Fission, others for  Fraction, and others for Perforation. And thus tho' the Body was _One_,  yet that governing Spirit made use of it several ways, according to the  respective uses of each Member, and the several ends which it propos'd  to obtain.    Sec. 29. Thus he perceiv'd that there was all this while but _One_ Animal  Spirit, whose Action when he made use of the Eye, was _Sight_; when of  the Ear, _Hearing_; when of the Nose, _Smelling_; when of the Tongue,  _Tasting_; and when of the Skin and Flesh, _Feeling_. When it employ'd  any Limb, then its Operation was _Motion_; and when it made use of the  Liver, _Nutrition_ and _Concoction_. And that, tho' there were Members  fitted to every one of these uses, yet none of them could perform their  respective Offices, without having Correspondence with that Spirit, by  means of the Nerves; and that if at any time it chanc'd that their  passages were either broken off or obstructed, such a Member would be  altogether useless. Now these; Nerves derive this Spirit from the Brain,  which has it from the Heart (and contains abundance of Spirit, because  it is divided into a great many partitions) and by what means soever any  limb is depriv'd of his Spirit, it's Action ceases, and 'tis like a cast  off Tool, not fit for use. And if this Spirit depart wholly from the  Body, or is consum'd or dissolv'd by any means whatsoever, then the  whole Body is depriv'd of Motion all at once, and reduced to a State of  Death.    Sec. 30. Thus far had his Observations brought him about the end of the  Third Seventh Year of his Age, _viz_. when he was One and Twenty Years  Old. In which time, he had made abundance of pretty Contrivances. He  made himself both Cloaths and Shoes of the Skins of such Wild Beasts as  he had dissected. His thread was made of Hair, and of the Bark of the  Stalks of Althaea, Mallows or any other Plants, which afforded such  Strings as were fit for that purpose. He learn'd the making of these  threads from the use which he had made of the Rushes before. He made  Awls of sharp Thorns, and Splinters of Cane, sharpned with Flints. He  learn'd the Art of Building, from the Observations he made upon the  Swallows Nests. He Builds himself a Store-house and a Pantry, to lay up  the remainder of his Provision in: and made a Door to it of Canes  twisted together, to prevent any of the Beasts getting in, during his  absence. He took Birds of prey and brought them up for Hawking; and kept  tame    Poultry for their Eggs and Chickens. He took the tips of the Buffalo's  Horns and fastned them upon the strongest Canes he could get, and Staves  of the Tree _Alzan_ and Others; and so, partly by the help of the Fire,  and partly of sharp edg'd Stones, he so fitted them that they serv'd him  instead of so many Spears. He made him a shield of Hides folded  together. All this pains he took to furnish himself with Artificial  Weapons, because he found himself destitute of Natural ones.    Sec. 31. Now when he perceiv'd that his Hand supplied all these defects  very well, and that none of all the various kinds of Wild Beasts durst  stand against him, but ran away from him, and were too Nimble for him.  He began to contrive how to be even with them, and thought there would  be no way so proper as to chuse out some of the strongest and swiftest  Beasts of the Island, and bring 'em up tame, and feed them with proper  Food, till they would let him back them and then he might persue the  other kinds of Wild Beasts. There were in that Island both Wild Horses  and Asses; he chose of both sorts, such as seem'd fittest for his  purpose, and by exercise he made them so gentle and tractable that he  was compleat Master of his Wishes. And when, he had made out of the  Skins of Beasts, such things as serv'd him competently well, in the Room  of Bridles and Saddles, he could very easily then overtake such Beasts,  as he could scarce ever have been able to have catch'd any other manner  of way. He made all these discoveries whilst he was employed in the  Study of Anatomy, and the searching out of the Properties, peculiar to  each Part, and the difference between them; and all this about that time  I speak of, _viz_. of the Age of 21 Years.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration 5]           *       *       *       *       *    Sec. 32. He then proceeded further to examin the Nature of Bodies in this  Sublunary World, _viz_. The different kinds of Animal, Plants, Minerals,  and several sorts of Stones, Earth, Water, Exhalations, Ice, Snow, Hail,  Smoak, Hoar, Frost, Flame, and Heat. In which he observ'd different  Qualities, and different Actions, and that their Motions agreed in some  respects, and differ'd in others: and considering these things with  great Application, he perceiv'd that their Qualities also agreed in some  things, and differ'd in others; and that so far as they agreed, they  were _One_; but when consider'd with Relation to their differences, _a  great many_: so that when he came to consider the Properties of things  by which they were distinguish'd one from another,he found that they  Multiplied so fast upon him, that 'twas impossible for him, to  Comprehend them. Nay, when he consider'd the difference of his own  Limbs, which he perceiv'd were all distinct from one another, by some  Property and Action peculiar to each, it seem'd to him that there was a  _Plurality_ in his Own Essence. And when he look'd upon any one Member  it self, he found that it might be divided into a great many parts, from  whence he concluded, that there must needs be a Plurality in his own  Essence, and not only in his own but in every other also.    Sec. 33. Then he enter'd upon another sort of Speculation of the second  kind, by which he perceiv'd that tho' the parts of his Body were many,  yet they were Conjoyned and Compacted together so as to make one Body,  and that what difference there was between them consisted only in the  difference of their Actions, which diversity proceeded from that Animal  Spirit, the Nature of which he had before search'd into, and found out.  Now he knew that his Spirit was One in Essence, and was really the  Substance of his Being, and that all the rest of the Members serve that  Spirit as Instruments, and in this Respect he perceiv'd his own Essence,  to be _One_.    Sec.. 34. He proceeded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#9)"],[1,"to nothing but conviction and affection, for Buddhism is  not a faith politically useful to an energetic and warlike prince.    5      Sinhalese Buddhism is often styled primitive or original and it may fairly  be said to preserve in substance both the doctrine and practice inculcated  in the earliest Pali literature. In calling this primitive we must remember  the possibility that some of this literature was elaborated in Ceylon  itself. But, putting the text of the Pitakas aside, it would seem that the  early Sinhalese Buddhism was the same as that of Asoka, and that it never  underwent any important change. It is true that mediaeval Sinhalese  literature is full of supernatural legends respecting the Buddha,[101] but  still he does not become a god (for he has attained Nirvana) and the great  Bodhisattvas, Avalokita and Manjusri, are practically unknown. The  _Abhidhammattha-sangaha_,[102] which is still the text-book most in use  among the Bhikkhus, adheres rigidly to the methods of the Abhidhamma.[103]  It contains neither devotional nor magical matter but prescribes a course  of austere mental training, based on psychological analysis and culminating  in the rapture of meditation. Such studies and exercises are beyond the  capacity of the majority, but no other road to salvation is officially  sanctioned for the Bhikkhu. It is admitted that there are no Arhats  now--just as Christianity has no contemporary saints--but no other ideal,  such as the Boddhisattva of the Mahayanists, is held up for imitation.    Mediaeval images of Avalokita and of goddesses have however been found  in Ceylon.[104] This is hardly surprising for the island was on the  main road to China, Java, and Camboja[105] and Mahayanist teachers and  pilgrims must have continually passed through it. The Chinese  biographies of that eminent tantrist, Amogha, say that he went to  Ceylon in 741 and elaborated his system there before returning to  China. It is said that in 1408 the Chinese being angry at the  ill-treatment of envoys whom they had sent to the shrine of the tooth,  conquered Ceylon and made it pay tribute for fifty years. By  conquest no doubt is meant merely a military success and not  occupation, but the whole story implies possibilities of acquaintance  with Chinese Buddhism.    It is clear that, though the Hinayanist church was predominant  throughout the history of the island, there were up to the twelfth  century heretical sects called Vaitulya or Vetulyaka and Vajira which  though hardly rivals of orthodoxy were a thorn in its side. A party at  the Abhayagiri monastery were favourably disposed to the Vaitulya sect  which, though often suppressed, recovered and reappeared, being  apparently reinforced from India. This need not mean from southern  India, for Ceylon had regular intercourse with the north and perhaps  the Vaitulyas were Mahayanists from Bengal. The Nikaya-Sangrahawa also  mentions that in the ninth century there was a sect called  Nilapatadarsana,[106] who wore blue robes and preached indulgence  in wine and love. They were possibly Tantrists from the north but were  persecuted in southern India and never influential in Ceylon.    The Mahavamsa is inclined to minimize the importance of all sects  compared with the Mahavihara, but the picture given by the  Nikaya-Sangrahawa may be more correct. It says that the Vaitulyas,  described as infidel Brahmans who had composed a Pitaka of their  own, made four attempts to obtain a footing at the Abhayagiri  monastery.[107] In the ninth century it represents king Matvalasen as  having to fly because he had embraced the false doctrine of the  Vajiras. These are mentioned in another passage in connection with the  Vaitulyas: they are said to have composed the Gudha Vinaya[108] and  many Tantras. They perhaps were connected with the Vajrayana, a phase  of Tantric Buddhism. But a few years later king Mungayinsen set the  church in order. He recognized the three orthodox schools or nikayas  called Theriya, Dhammaruci and Sagaliya but proscribed the others and  set guards on the coast to prevent the importation of heresy.  Nevertheless the Vajiriya and Vaitulya doctrines were secretly  practised. An inscription in Sanskrit found at the Jetavana and  attributed to the ninth century[109] records the foundation of a  Vihara for a hundred resident monks, 25 from each of the four nikayas,  which it appears to regard as equivalent. But in 1165 the great  Parakrama Bahu held a synod to restore unity in the church. As a  result, all Nikayas (even the Dhammaruci) which did not conform to the  Mahavihara were suppressed[110] and we hear no more of the Vaitulyas  and Vajiriyas.    Thus there was once a Mahayanist faction in Ceylon, but it was  recruited from abroad, intermittent in activity and was finally  defeated, whereas the Hinayanist tradition was national and  continuous.    Considering the long lapse of time, the monastic life of Ceylon has  not deviated much in practice from the injunctions of the Vinaya.  Monasteries like those of Anuradhapura, which are said to have  contained thousands of monks, no longer exist. The largest now to be  found--those at Kandy--do not contain more than fifty but as a rule a  pansala (as these institutions are now called) has not more than five  residents and more often only two or three. Some pansalas have  villages assigned to them and some let their lands and do not scruple  to receive the rent. The monks still follow the ancient routine of  making a daily round with the begging bowl, but the food thus  collected is often given to the poor or even to animals and the  inmates of the pansala eat a meal which has been cooked there. The  Patimokkha is recited (at least in part) twice a month and ordinations  are held annually.[111]    The duties of the Bhikkhus are partly educational, partly clerical. In  most villages the children receive elementary education gratis in the  pansala, and the preservation of the ancient texts, together with the  long list of Pali and Sinhalese works produced until recent times  almost exclusively by members of the Sangha,[112] is a proof that it  has not neglected literature. The chief public religious  observances are preaching and reading the scriptures. This latter,  known as Bana, is usually accompanied by a word for word translation  made by the reciter or an assistant. Such recitations may form part of  the ordinary ceremonial of Uposatha days and most religious  establishments have a room where they can be held, but often monks are  invited to reside in a village during Was (July to October) and read  Bana, and often a layman performs a pinkama or act of merit by  entertaining monks for several days and inviting his neighbours to  hear them recite. The recitation of the Jatakas is particularly  popular but the suttas of the Digha Nikaya are also often read. On  special occasions such as entry into a new house, an eclipse or any  incident which suggests that it might be well to ward off the enmity  of supernatural powers, it is usual to recite a collection of texts  taken largely from the Suttanipata and called Pirit. The word appears  to be derived from the Pali _paritta_, a defence, and though the Pali  scriptures do not sanction this use of the Buddha's discourses they  countenance the idea that evil may be averted by the use of  formulae.[113]    Although Sinhalese Buddhism has not diverged much from the Pali  scriptures in its main doctrines and discipline, yet it tolerates a  superstructure of Indian beliefs and ceremonies which forbid us to  call it pure except in a restricted sense. At present there may be  said to be three religions in Ceylon; local animism, Hinduism and  Buddhism are all inextricably mixed together. By local animism I mean  the worship of native spirits who do not belong to the ordinary Hindu  pantheon though they may be identified with its members. The priests  of this worship are called Kapuralas and one of their principal  ceremonies consists in dancing until they are supposed to be possessed  by a spirit--the devil dancing of Europeans. Though this religion is  distinct from ordinary Hinduism, its deities and ceremonies find  parallels in the southern Tamil country. In Ceylon it is not merely a  village superstition but possesses temples of considerable  size,[114] for instance at Badulla and near Ratnapura. In the latter  there is a Buddhist shrine in the court yard, so that the Blessed One  may countenance the worship, much as the Pitakas represent him as  patronizing and instructing the deities of ancient Magadha, but the  structure and observances of the temple itself are not Buddhist. The  chief spirit worshipped at Ratnapura and in most of these temples is  Maha Saman, the god of Adam's Peak. He is sometimes identified with  Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, and sometimes with Indra.    About a quarter of the population are Tamils professing Hinduism.  Hindu temples of the ordinary Dravidian type are especially frequent  in the northern districts, but they are found in most parts and at  Kandy two may be seen close to the shrine of the Tooth.[115] Buddhists  feel no scruple in frequenting them and the images of Hindu deities  are habitually introduced into Buddhist temples. These often contain a  hall, at the end of which are one or more sitting figures of the  Buddha, on the right hand side a recumbent figure of him, but on the  left a row of four statues representing Mahabrahma, Vishnu,  Karttikeya and Mahasaman. Of these Vishnu generally receives marked  attention, shown by the number of prayers written on slips of paper  which are attached to his hand. Nor is this worship found merely as a  survival in the older temples. The four figures appear in the newest  edifices and the image of Vishnu never fails to attract votaries.  Yet though a rigid Buddhist may regard such devotion as dangerous, it  is not treasonable, for Vishnu is regarded not as a competitor but"]]]
