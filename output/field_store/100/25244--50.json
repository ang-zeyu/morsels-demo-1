I don't want you.  Come,  off you go, or I'll show you the way.\"    Charlie turned to go, yet still lingered.  A desperate struggle was  taking place, I could feel, within him, and then he stammered out, \"I  say, Tom Drift, if you'll only be friends I'll _give_ you my watch.\"    Poor boy!  Who knows what that offer cost him? it was indeed the dearest  bribe he had to give.    Tom laughed sneeringly.  \"Who wants your watch, young ass?--a miserable,  second-hand, tin ticker; I'd be ashamed to be seen with it.  Come, once  more, get out of here or I'll kick you out!\"    Charlie obeyed, miserable and disappointed.    He could stand being spoken roughly to, he could bear his  disappointment, but to hear his father's precious gift spoken of as a  \"miserable, second-hand tin ticker,\" was more than he could endure, and  he made his way back to his room conscious of having lost more than he  had gained by this thankless effort at reconciliation.    \"What are you in the sulks about?\" inquired Halliday that evening, as  Charlie was putting away his lord and master's jam in the cupboard.    \"I don't want to be sulky,\" Charlie said, \"but I wish I could make it up  with Tom Drift.\"    \"With who?\" exclaimed Joe, who, as we have before observed, was subject  to occasional lapses of grammar.    \"Tom Drift, you know; we had a row the first day.\"    \"I know,\" replied Joe; \"about that everlasting watch of yours, wasn't  it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Charlie, \"I didn't like to lend it him, because--\"    \"I know all about that,\" said Halliday.  \"You were squeamish about  something or other he wanted it for.  Well, the watch belonged to you, I  suppose, and you aren't obliged to lend it to anybody.  What on earth do  you want to go worrying about the thing any more for?\"    \"I'm not; only I wanted to be friends with Tom Drift.\"    \"What for?\" demanded Joe.    \"Oh, because--because I promised his mother I would be,\" pleaded  Charlie.    \"All I can say is, you had no business to promise any one to be friends  with a fellow you never saw.\"    \"But she said he was a nice fellow; and besides he made my watch go when  it had stopped,\" added Charlie, as a great argument.    \"Why, Charlie, you are a greater little noodle than I took you for.  Every one who calls that precious watch a good name is your master, and  you're his slave.\"    \"Not so bad as that, Joe,\" said Charlie; \"but I say, isn't Tom Drift a  nice boy, then?\"    \"Isn't he? that's all,\" replied the other.  \"I'm not going to abuse him  behind his back, but take my advice, young un.  You are better off as  Tom's enemy than his friend, and don't you try to make up to him any  more.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Charlie in bewilderment.    \"Never you mind,\" was all Joe's reply; \"and now hand me down my Liddell  and Scott and make yourself scarce.\"    Charlie, sorely puzzled, did as he was bid.    He certainly was not in love with Tom Drift; but it was not easy for him  to give up, without an effort, his promise to be his friend.    Tom, however, was by no means in need of friends.  Not many weeks after  the day when Charlie had left his study, disappointed and miserable, he  might have been seen entertaining company of quite a different sort.    [My readers, let me here observe, must not be too curious to understand  how it is I am able to speak of so many things which must have taken  place beyond the range of my observation.  They will find the reason all  in good time.]    The supper party over which Tom presided consisted of four boys,  including himself.  One was Shadbolt, on whose account, it will be  remembered, Tom had desired to borrow Charlie's watch.  Shadbolt was an  unwholesome-looking fellow of fifteen, with coarse features and eyes  that could not look you straight in the face if they had tried.  He was  accompanied by his chum Margetson, who certainly had the advantage of  his friend in looks, as well as in intellect.  The quartet was completed  by Gus Burke, one of the smallest and most vicious boys at Randlebury.  He was the son of a country squire, who had the unenviable reputation of  being one of the hardest drinkers and fastest riders in his county; and  the boy had already shown himself only too apt a pupil in the lessons in  the midst of which his childhood had been passed.  He had at his  tongue's tip all the slang of the stables and all the blackguardisms of  the betting-ring; and boy--almost child--as he was, he affected the  swagger and habits of a \"fast man,\" like a true son of his father.    At Randlebury he had wrought incredible mischief.  Tom Drift was not the  only soft-minded vain boy whom he had infected by his pernicious  example.  Like all reckless swaggerers, he had his band of admirers, who  marked every action and drank in every word that fell from their hero's  lips.    It was just with such boys as Drift that his influence was most telling;  for Tom was a boy not without aptitude to note and emulate a powerful  example, whether it were good or bad, while his vanity rendered him as  pliant as wax to the hand of the flatterer.    Such was the party which assembled surreptitiously in Tom's study that  evening and partook of the smuggled supper.    Tom had had hard work to provide for his guests, and had succeeded only  at the risk of grave penalties if detected.    \"I say, Tom, old horse, this is a prime spread!\" said Gus; \"where did  you get it?\"    \"Oh!\" said Tom, \"I had a new hat coming from Tiler's, so I got old  Tripes (the butcher) to make a neat brown-paper parcel of the kidneys,  and got them up in my gossamer.  The old donkey might have done the  thing better though, for the juice squeezed through, and the inside of  my hat looks as if I had lately been scalped.\"    \"Hard lines!  But never mind, perhaps they'll put it down to the crack  you got on your forehead.\"    Tom flushed scarlet; any reference to his inglorious scuffle with  Charlie Newcome was odious to him, as Gus and the others knew well  enough.  He said nothing, however, only scowled angrily.    \"What!\" said Gus, \"does it hurt you still then?  Never mind, it was a  good shot, and I wouldn't be ashamed of having floored you myself.\"    \"He didn't floor me; I fell!\" cried Tom indignantly.    \"Did you?  Rather a way fellows have when they get knocked down!\"    \"I was not knocked down, Gus, I tell you; and you'd better shut up!\"    \"All right, old horse! you mustn't mind a bit of chaff.  I'm sure you've  taken it all very well.\"    \"Yes,\" said Margetson, \"everybody thinks you must take after your  mother; you're such a sweet-tempered chap.\"    \"What do you know about my mother?\" snarled Tom.    \"Only what your young friend tells everybody about her.\"    \"What business has he to go talking all over the school about my  affairs?\" exclaimed Tom furiously.  \"What's my mother to do with him?\"    \"A great deal, it seems,\" replied Margetson, \"for he promised her, on  the strength of her assertion that you were a nice boy, to be your  friend, and now he's awfully hurt you won't let him.\"    \"I thought it was Tom who was awfully hurt,\" put in Gus, by way of  parenthesis.    \"I tell you what it is, you fellows,\" said Tom, \"it may be all very  funny for you, but I've had quite enough of it.  Ever since that young  canting humbug came here I've led the life of a dog.  If, instead of  making a fool of me, you'd tell me how I can pay him out, I should be  better pleased.\"    \"All very fine,\" said Margetson; \"why don't you pay your own bills?\"    \"If you want some one to punch his head,\" said Shadbolt the ugly, \"I  don't mind trying; my life is insured.\"    \"Suppose we make him stupid,\" suggested Gus, \"with milk punch, and shove  him inside the doctor's study.\"    \"Couldn't you get hold of his watch and boil it?\" said Margetson, who  had heard of the experiments practised on me in Mrs Packer's parlour.    \"If I got hold of it I'd smash it into fifty pieces!\" growled Tom  between his teeth.    \"Look here, you fellows, I've got a glorious plan!\" exclaimed Gus  suddenly.    \"What is it?\" they all cried.    But Gus's plan requires a new chapter.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    HOW A PLEASANT TREAT IN STORE WAS PREPARED FOR MY MASTER.    Gus proceeded then to divulge his plan for giving Tom Drift his revenge  on my master.    \"Let's take him to Gurley races on Saturday,\" said he.  \"You know it's a  holiday, and if we can only get him with us, well astonish his  sanctimonious young soul.  What do you say?\"    \"You'll never get him to come,\" said Margetson.    \"Won't we?  Well see about that,\" replied Gus, \"he needn't know where  he's going.\"    \"But even so,\" said Drift, \"you won't get him; he's not in love with me,  and I don't fancy any of you are much in his line.\"    \"Oh, you'll have to manage that part, Tom.  You know how the young  idiot's pining to make it up with you, for your dear old mother's sake!\"    \"Now you needn't start that nonsense again,\" put in Tom sulkily.    \"All right; but don't you see, if you were to take a forgiving fit and  make up to him, and talk about the old lady and his watch, and all that,  he'd be out of his wits with joy? and then if you asked him to come for  a day's fishing on Saturday, we could meet you somewhere on the road,  and then he'd have to come whether he liked or not; and won't we  astonish him!\"    Tom mused a little.    \"It's not a bad idea,\" said he presently, \"if it would only work.  But I  can't make up to the young puppy as you think.  Ten to one I should stop  short in the middle and kick him.\"    \"That would spoil all the fun.  Try it on, any way, it'll be a nice  little excitement to have young Innocent with us.  And now,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#9)"],[1,"th, and next moment he was  back in his bed.    I was vexed.  For I half guessed this alarm had been only an excuse for  not talking about home, and I didn't like being silenced in that way.  Altogether that night I was a good deal put out with Smith, and when  presently he whispered across \"Good-night,\" I pretended to be asleep,  and did not answer.    But I was not asleep, and could not sleep.  I worked myself first into a  rage, then into an injured state, and finally into a miserable condition  over my friend Smith.    Why should he keep secrets from me, when I kept none from him?  No, when  I came to think over it, I did not keep a single secret from him!  Did  he think I was not to be trusted, or was too selfish to care?  He might  have known me better by this time.  It was true I had told him my  secrets without his asking for them; in fact, all along he had not  seemed nearly as anxious as I had been for this friendship of ours.  My  conscience stung me at this last reflection; and there came upon me all  of a sudden a sense of the utter desolation of this awful place without  a single friend!  No, I determined it should take more than a little  pique to make me cast away my only friend.  And with the thought, though  it must have been far on in the night, I slipped from my bed and crawled  to his.    He was fast asleep, but at the first touch of my hand he started up and  said, \"What's the row?\"    \"I'm sorry, Jack; but I was in a temper to-night, and couldn't go to  sleep till I made it up.\"    \"A temper! what about?\" said he.  \"I didn't know you were.\"    \"I fancied you wouldn't--that is, that you thought--you didn't trust me,  Jack.\"    \"You're the only fellow I do trust, Fred, there,\" said he, taking my  arm.  Then, with a sigh, he added, \"Why shouldn't I?\"    \"What a beast I was, Jack!\" cried I, quite repentant.  \"I don't--\"    \"Hush!\" said Jack.  Then, whispering very close to my ear, he added,  \"There are some things, you know, I _can't_ tell even you--about home--\"    There was a sound in the room, as of a boy, suddenly aroused, starting  up in his bed.  Our blood turned cold, and we remained motionless,  hardly daring to breathe, straining our ears in the darkness.    Suddenly the boy, whoever he was, sprang from his bed, and seizing the  lucifers, struck a light.    It was Hawkesbury!  I had almost guessed it.  I felt Jack's hand tighten  on my arm as the sudden glare fell full upon us, and Hawkesbury's voice  cried, \"Oh, you fellows, what a start you gave me!  I couldn't make out  what the talking was.  I thought it must be thieves!\"    At the same moment the dormitory door opened, and a new glare lit up the  scene.  It was Miss Henniker in her dressing-gown, with a candle.    \"What, talking?  Who was talking?\" she said, overhearing Hawkesbury's  last exclamation.    It was a queer picture that moment, and I can recall it even now.  Hawkesbury standing in his night-shirt in the middle of the room.  I, as  lightly clad, crouching transfixed beside my friend's bed, who was  sitting up with his hand on my arm.  And the Henniker there at the door,  in her yellow-and-black dressing-gown and curl-papers, holding her  candle above her head, and looking from one to the other.    \"Who was talking?\" she demanded again, turning to Hawkesbury.    Hawkesbury, smiling, returned to his bed, as he replied, \"Oh, nothing.  I think I must have been dreaming, and woke in a fright.\"    But as he spoke his eyes turned to us two, and Miss Henniker's followed  naturally.  Then the whole truth dawned upon her.    I rose from my knees and walked sheepishly back to my bed.    \"What are you doing out of your bed, sir?\" demanded she.    It was little use delaying matters by a parley, so I replied, bluntly,  \"Talking to Smith.\"    \"And I,\" added the loyal Smith, \"was talking to Batchelor!\"    \"Silence!\" cried the Griffin.  \"Batchelor, dress immediately, and follow  me!\"    I did as I was bid, mechanically--that is, I slipped on my  knickerbockers and slippers--and found myself in a couple of minutes,  thus airily attired, following Miss Henniker, like a ghost, down the  long passage.  She led the way, not, as I expected, to the parlour, or  to Mr Ladislaw's room, but conducted me upstairs and ushered me into a  small and perfectly empty garret.    \"Remain here, Batchelor!\" said she, sternly.    The next moment she was gone, locking the door behind her, and I was  left shivering, and in total darkness, to spend the remainder of the  night in these unexpected quarters.    My first sensation was one of utter and uncontrollable rage.  I was  tempted to fling myself against the door, to shout, to roar until some  one should come to release me.  Then as suddenly came over me the  miserable certainty that I was helpless, and that anything I did would  be but labour lost, and injure no one but myself.  And, Smith, too!  It  was all up with our precious secret parleys; perhaps we should not even  be allowed to see one another any more.  In my misery I sat down on the  floor in a corner of my dungeon and felt as if I would not much care if  the house were to fall about my ears and bury me in the ruins.  Cheerful  reflection this for a youth of my tender years!    As I sat, shivering and brooding over my hard fate, I heard footsteps  ascending the stairs.  When you are sitting alone in an empty room, at  the dead of night, this is never a very fascinating sound, and I did not  much enjoy it.    And as I listened I could make out that the footsteps belonged to two  people.  Perhaps I was going to be murdered, I reflected, like Prince  Arthur, or the two boys in the Tower!  At the same moment a streak of  light glimmered through the crack of the door, and I heard a voice say,  \"Come this way, Smith.\"    So Smith, too, was going to be locked up for the night.  My heart  bounded as for an instant it occurred to me it would be in my dungeon!  No such good fortune!  They passed my door.  At any rate, my chum should  know where I was, so I proceeded to make a demonstration against my door  and beseech, in the most piteous way, to be released.  Of course, it was  no use, but that did not matter; I never expected it would.    I listened hard to the retreating footsteps, which stopped at the end of  the passage.  Then a door opened and shut again, a key turned, one pair  of steps again returned past my door, and as I peeped through the  keyhole I had a vague idea of a yellow-and-black gown, and knew that the  Henniker had gone back to her place.    If only Smith had been shut up next door to me I might have been able to  shout to him so that he could hear, but what chance was there when three  or four rooms at least divided us?  After all, except that he was near  me, and knew where I was, things were not much better than they had been  before.  So I sat down again in my corner and sulkily watched the first  glimmers of dawn peep in at the little window.  It must be about 3 a.m.,  I thought.  And that meant four good hours before any chance of a  release came.  And as it was, my feet were pretty nearly dead with cold,  and a thin nightgown is not much covering for a fellow's body and arms.  It rather pleased me to think the adventure might end fatally, and that  at my inquest Miss Henniker might be brought in guilty of manslaughter.    It must be breezy, for those leaves have been tapping away at my window  the last minute or so pretty hard.  Bother the leaves!  And yet, when  you come to think of it, you do not often hear leaves tap as hard as  that!  My window will be smashed in if they keep it up at that rate.  So  I get up lazily and approach the scene of action.    I nearly screamed as I did so, for there, close up against the window,  was a face!  I was so taken aback that it took me a good minute to  recover my wits and perceive that the apparition was none other than my  faithful friend Jack Smith, and that the tapping I had been giving the  leaves such credit for had been his eager attempts to attract my  attention.    I sprang to the window, jubilant, and opened it.    \"Oh, Jack! hurrah!  However did you get here?\"    \"Oh, you have _spotted_ me at last, have you?\" said he, with a grim  smile.  \"I've been here five or ten minutes.\"    \"You have!\" exclaimed I.    \"Yes.  My window opened on to this ledge, too; so I didn't see why I  shouldn't come.\"    \"You might have fallen and killed yourself.  But I say, Jack, won't you  come in?  Even if we do get caught things can't be much worse than they  are.\"    \"I know that--so I think you'd better come out.\"    \"What for?\" exclaimed I, in astonishment.    \"To get away--anywhere,\" said he.    In a moment I was up on the window-sill, scrambling out on to the ledge  beside him.  The fresh morning breeze blew on my face as I did so, and a  glorious sense of freedom took hold of both our drooping spirits.  We  needed no words.  Only let us get free!    \"Come along,\" said Jack, crawling along the narrow ledge which ran round  the top of the house.    \"How shall we get down?\"  I asked.    \"That's what I want to find out,\" said Jack.  \"Isn't there a water-pipe  or something in front?\"    Carefully we made our perilous journey round the side of the house  towards the front.  Smith leaned over and peered down.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"there's a water-pipe we could easily slide down, if we  could only get at it.  Look!\"    I looked over too.  The ground seemed a long way below, and I felt a  trifle nervous at the prospect of trying to reach it by such unorthodox  means as a water-pipe, even could we get at that pipe.  But the ledge on  which we were overhung the side of the house, and the pipe began under  it, just below where we stood.    \"We must try, anyhow,\" said Jack, desperately.  \"I'll go first; catch  hold of my hands, Fred.\"    And he was actually going to attempt to scramble over and round under  the ledge, when he suddenly paused, and cried, \"Hold hard.  I do believe  this bit of ledge is"]]]
