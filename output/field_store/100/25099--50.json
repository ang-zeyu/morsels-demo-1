The _left  semilunar_ valve is around the opening of the left ventricle into the  aorta, and is similar in all respects to the right semilunar valve.    *Differences in the Parts of the Heart.*--Marked differences are found in  the walls surrounding the different cavities of the heart. The walls of  the ventricles are much thicker and stronger than those of the auricles,  while the walls of the left ventricle are two or three times thicker than  those of the right. A less marked but similar difference exists between  the auricles and also between the valves on the two sides of the heart.  These differences in structure are all accounted for by the work done by  the different portions of the heart. The greater the work, the heavier the  structures that perform the work.                                    [Fig. 17]      Fig. 17--*Diagram of the circulation*, showing in general the work done by   each part of the heart. The right ventricle forces the blood through the   lungs and into the left auricle. The left ventricle forces blood through   all parts of the body and back to the auricle. The auricles force blood                             into the ventricles.      *Connection with Arteries and Veins.*--Though the heart is in communication  with all parts of the circulatory system, it makes actual connection with  only a few of the blood tubes. These enter the heart at its upper portion  (Fig. 15), but connect with its different cavities as follows:    1. _With the right auricle_, the superior and the inferior venae cavae and  the coronary veins. The superior vena cava receives blood from the head  and the upper extremities; the inferior vena cava, from the trunk and the  lower extremities; and the coronary veins, from the heart itself.    2. _With the left auricle_, the four pulmonary veins. These receive blood  from the lungs and empty it into the left auricle.    3. _With the right ventricle_, the pulmonary artery. This receives blood  from the heart and by its branches distributes it to all parts of the  lungs.    4. _With the left ventricle_, the aorta. The aorta receives blood from the  heart and through its branches delivers it to all parts of the body.    *How the Heart does its Work.*--The heart is a muscular pump(18) and does  its work through the contracting and relaxing of its walls. During  contraction the cavities are closed and the blood is forced out of them.  During relaxation the cavities open and are refilled. The valves direct  the flow of the blood, being so arranged as to keep it moving always in  the same direction (Fig. 17).    The heart, however, is not a single or a simple pump, but consists in  reality of _four_ pumps which correspond to its different cavities. These  connect with each other and with the blood vessels over the body in such a  manner that each aids in the general movement of the blood.                                    [Fig. 18]                  Fig. 18--Diagram illustrating the \"cardiac cycle.\"      *Work of Auricles and Ventricles Compared.*--In the work of the heart the  two auricles contract at the same time--their contraction being followed  immediately by the contraction of both ventricles. After the contraction  of the ventricles comes a period of rest, or relaxation, about equal in  time to the period of contraction of both the auricles and the  ventricles.(19) On account of the work which they perform, the auricles  have been called the \"feed pumps\" of the heart; and the ventricles, the  \"force pumps.\"(20) It is the function of the auricles to collect the blood  from the veins, to let this run slowly into the ventricles when both the  auricles and ventricles are relaxed, and finally, by contracting, _to  force an excess of blood into the ventricles_, thereby distending their  walls. The ventricles, having in this way been fully charged by the  auricles, now contract and force their contents into the large arteries.    *Sounds of the Heart.*--Two distinct sounds are given out by the heart as  it pumps the blood. One of them is a dull and rather heavy sound, while  the other is a short, sharp sound. The short sound follows quickly after  the dull sound and the two are fairly imitated by the words \"lubb, dup.\"  While the cause of the first sound is not fully understood, most  authorities believe it to be due to the contraction of the heart muscle  and the sudden tension on the valve flaps. The second sound is due to the  closing of the semilunar valves. These sounds are easily heard by placing  an ear against the chest wall. They are of great value to the physician in  determining the condition of the heart.    *Arteries and Veins.*--These form two systems of tubes which reach from the  heart to all parts of the body. The arteries receive blood from the heart  and distribute it to the capillaries. The veins receive the blood from the  capillaries and return it to the heart. The arteries and veins are similar  in structure, both having the form of tubes and both having three distinct  layers, or coats, in their walls. The corresponding coats in the arteries  and veins are made up of similar materials, as follows:    1. _The inner coat_ consists of a delicate lining of flat cells resting  upon a thin layer of connective tissue. The inner coat is continuous with  the lining of the heart and provides a smooth surface over which the blood  glides with little friction.    2. _The middle coat_ consists mainly of non-striated, or involuntary,  muscular fibers. This coat is quite thin in the veins, but in the arteries  it is rather thick and strong.    3. _The outer coat_ is made up of a variety of connective tissue and is  also much thicker and stronger in the arteries than in the veins.                                    [Fig. 19]                     Fig. 19--Artery dissected to show the coats.      Marked differences exist between the arteries and the veins, and these  vessels are readily distinguished from each other. The walls of the  arteries are much thicker and heavier than those of the veins (Fig. 19).  As a result these tubes stand open when empty, whereas the veins collapse.  The arteries also are highly elastic, while the veins are but slightly  elastic. On the other hand, many of the veins contain valves, formed by  folds in the inner coat (Fig. 20), while the arteries have no valves. The  blood flows more rapidly through the arteries than through the veins, the  difference being due to the fact that the system of veins has a greater  capacity than the system of arteries.                                    [Fig. 20]                     Fig. 20--Vein split open to show the valves.      *Why the Arteries are Elastic.*--The elasticity of the arteries serves a  twofold purpose. It keeps the arteries from bursting when the blood is  forced into them from the ventricles, and it is a means of _supplying  pressure to the blood while the ventricles are in a condition of  relaxation._ The latter purpose is accomplished as follows:    Contraction of the ventricles fills the arteries overfull, causing them to  swell out and make room for the excess of blood. Then while the ventricles  are resting and filling, the stretched arteries press upon the blood to  keep it flowing into the capillaries. In this way _they cause the  intermittent flow from, the heart to become a steady stream in the  capillaries_.    The swelling of the arteries at each contraction of the ventricle is  easily felt at certain places in the body, such as the wrist. This  expansion, known as the \"pulse,\" is the chief means employed by the  physician in determining the force and rapidity of the heart's action.    *Purpose of the Valves in the Veins.*--The valves in the veins are not used  for directing the _general_ flow of the blood, the valves of the heart  being sufficient for this purpose. Their presence is necessary because of  the pressure to which the veins are subjected in different parts of the  body. The contraction of a muscle will, for example, close the small veins  in its vicinity and diminish the capacity of the larger ones. The natural  tendency of such pressure is to empty the veins in two directions--one in  the same direction as the regular movement of the blood, but the other in  the opposite direction. The valves by closing cause the contracting muscle  to push the blood in one direction only--toward the heart. The valves in  the veins are, therefore, an economical device for _enabling variable  pressure_ in different parts of the body _to assist in the circulation_.  Veins like the inferior vena cava and the veins of the brain, which are  not compressed by movements of the body, do not have valves.    *Purposes of the Muscular Coat.*--The muscular coat, which is thicker in  the arteries than in the veins and is more marked in small arteries than  in large ones, serves two important purposes. In the first place it,  together with the elastic tissue, keeps the capacity of the blood vessels  _equal to the volume of the blood_. Since the blood vessels are capable of  holding more blood than may be present at a given time in the body, there  is a liability of empty spaces occurring in these tubes. Such spaces would  seriously interfere with the circulation, since the heart pressure could  not then reach all parts of the blood stream. This is prevented by the  contracted state, or \"tone,\" of the blood vessels, due to the muscular  coat.    In the second place, the muscular coat serves the purpose of _regulating_  the amount of blood which any given organ or part of the body receives.  This it does by varying the caliber of the arteries going to the organ in  question. To increase the blood supply, the muscular coat relaxes. The  arteries are then dilated by the blood pressure from within so as to let  through a larger quantity of blood. To diminish the supply, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#9)"],[1,"it spits it out on your finger.    What? You don't like its old molasses on your finger?    No, of course not.    It smells bad, and it is sticky and disagreeable to the touch, and if  you happen to put your finger in your mouth it has a nasty taste.    [Illustration]    John says he hates to touch the grasshopper on account of this molasses.    You _all_ do?    Well, I guess that is why it makes its molasses; it doesn't want you to  touch it.    It doesn't want birds to eat it, or other insects to bother it, and so  it smears them with this ill-smelling, sticky liquid.    Some birds eat it, however, in spite of its molasses.    Turkeys do.    What is that, Ned? turkeys are not birds, you think?    What are they?    If you think about it, you will have to come to the conclusion that  turkeys are birds.    Then chickens and ducks and geese must be birds?    Well, so they are. They are all birds.    But to return to turkeys.    A flock of turkeys will spread out in a long line, and go across a  field, driving the grasshoppers ahead of them, and eating them as fast  as they can pick them up.    It is a funny sight to see a big flock of turkeys hunting grasshoppers  in a meadow.    It is not funny to the grasshoppers, though.    What is that, Charlie? The grasshopper somehow reminds you of the  praying mantis?    Do you know it is a near relative of the mantis?    Now, I will tell you something funny about the mantis.    It makes \"molasses\" like the grasshopper. Yes, it is this harmless  \"molasses\" that has given it the name of \"mule-killer.\"    I will tell you something else. If you lie down in the grass and watch  the grasshoppers, you will have a good time, and you will see some  strange things.    Nobody can tell you very much about the grasshoppers--or about the  living creature. The best way is to use your own eyes and watch.    Just lie down in the grass perfectly still, and soon the insects that  live in the grass will begin to appear.    [Illustration]    What they will do you must find out for yourselves; but you may be sure  it will be worth finding out,--the funny, clever, wise little  people!--ah! they are good to watch.    They will soon go on chirping and shrilling and rasping and kricking and  tapping and whizzing and whirring and buzzing all about you; and if you  listen sharp, perhaps you can understand some of the things they say.    And this I am sure of; if you really watch and listen, you can learn to  know the different insects by their sounds, just as you can know the  birds by their songs. You can even tell whether you are listening to the  meadow grasshopper, or the locust.    If I thought you were not tired of hearing how grasshoppers are made, I  should tell you some more.    John says he would like to know some more.    Well, then, I will tell you about their rings.    You can see the rings of the grasshopper people very plainly in their  abdomens.    [Illustration]    Here is a picture of a grasshopper. It is not all drawn. The legs and  wings are not shown, and the abdomen is drawn by itself so you can see  it easily.    There are ten rings, you see.    The rings are covered with a hard, horny substance.    This horny substance is what makes the body of the insect so stiff. It  would be soft but for the chitin, as the horny substance is called.    It is better for the insect to have a chitinous covering.    If you had no bones, you would be glad to have your skin hardened with  chitin.    You see how it is, you wear your skeleton inside. Your skeleton is of  bones; it is an inside skeleton.    The grasshoppers and all the insects wear their skeleton outside. It is  made of chitin; it is an outside skeleton.    Insects have no bones.    They do not need any. They are kept stiff by the chitin.    Each ring in the insect's abdomen is made of four pieces, the back  piece, the side pieces, and the under piece. You can see the back piece  and one side piece in the picture, but you cannot see the other side  piece nor the under piece without turning the insect over.    The rings are made in pieces so the insect can move.    Suppose each ring were made of one stiff piece like a finger ring. What  a poor stiff, old grasshopper it would be! The rings are called  segments.    Segment number one has only a back piece, you see.    All the other segments have four pieces.    Segments two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight are alike.    Segments nine and ten are modified to form the ovipositor.    The segments are fastened together by skin. The skin is soft so the  segments can move back and forth.    The segments can be crowded close together to shorten the abdomen.    The segments can be separated from each other to lengthen the abdomen.    There is no chitin in the skin between the segments. It is soft so the  segments can move.    Do you know how a telescope is made?    The abdomen of the insect can lengthen and shorten somewhat like a  telescope.    It is easy to see the rings in the abdomen of the locust or grasshopper.    Now, what about the thorax?    That, you tell me, has no rings.    [Illustration]    Look again, and look carefully.    You will have to see another picture.    This is a picture of the head and thorax of the grasshopper. It is drawn  to show the separate parts of the thorax.    Yes, John, the thorax has three segments. They are grown so close  together you would not suspect it until you looked very close.    The front legs are fastened to the first segment.    What is fastened to the middle segment?    Yes, May, the middle pair of legs and the wing covers.    Mollie says the long hind legs and the flying wings are fastened to the  third or hind segment.    Oh, you funny little folks! you are all made up of rings.    Yes, indeed, little Nell, the segments of the thorax are made of chitin;  they are very stiff.    Ned thinks the segments of the legs are made of chitin too.    Their outside shell certainly is.    The whole outer shell of the insect is made of the horny chitin.    You hard little chitin-covered, segmented people, you are very different  from us.    Ah! yes, May, they are like us in many ways.    Indeed, Mollie, insects do have brains.    They have muscles, too, to move their little bodies with.    We have muscles under our skin, you know. The muscles move our arms and  legs and bodies.    If you clasp your fingers around your arm and then move your arm, you  can feel the muscles.    The insects have muscles inside their chitinous shells. The muscles move  their bodies.    The muscles are very, very strong.    They are stronger for their size than the muscles of a horse.    John, do you know how heavy a load a horse can pull?    Well, it cannot pull a load equal to the weight of its own body.    Now, listen to this,--almost any insect can pull a load that is five  times the weight of its body!    Ah, yes, some insects can pull a much heavier weight than that. The  honey bee, for instance, can pull a load twenty times as heavy as its  body.    And think how our little insect friends can jump! Why, a kangaroo cannot  begin to jump like a grasshopper.    No, indeed, Ned, the finest jumper in the world of men cannot begin to  jump as well as a grasshopper, not even with the aid of a spring board.  He is a mere baby in comparison.    Ah, yes, we can do a great many things better than the grasshoppers,  but, you see, they can do some things better than we can.    What is that, John?    You want to know about the mouth parts of the grasshopper?    Suppose we leave the mouth parts.    They are difficult to understand. We have had a good many new names to  learn lately.    What, May? You can't remember such hard words?    Oh, yes, of course you can.    You don't mind learning \"rhinoceros,\" and \"Mississippi,\" and  \"Popocatepetl,\" and \"eenie, meenie, monie mike,\" and they are quite as  hard as femur and tibia; and, besides, you have a femur yourself! Did  you know it?    Your thigh bone, like the grasshopper's thigh, is called a femur.    Yes, Mollie, there is a bone in your leg called the tibia, and you have  a tarsus in your foot.    So, after all, when you are learning hard words about insects you are  learning a great deal besides, as you will find.    [Illustration]          PRETTY KATYDIDS    [Illustration]      Katy did!    Katy didn't!    Katy did!    Well, well, did she or didn't she, and what of it anyway.    Come here, Katy did and Katy didn't, the children want to see you.    She's a pretty little Did and Didn't, isn't she.    Katy, why do you not know your own mind and always tell the same story?    Krick--krick--krick, there, she is talking; that's her way of saying  \"Katy did.\"    Krick--krick--krickkrick. Now she has said \"Katy didn't.\"    Well, we never shall know anything more about it.    No, little Nell, she doesn't really say Katy did or Katy didn't, but it  sounds like that, and we make believe she says it.    John says he is sure the katydids are first cousins to the grasshoppers  and locusts, and so they are.    They are very closely related to--which division of locusts, do you  think?    Oh, yes, the longhorned, of course.    See their long, long antennae, and the male has the same little musical  places on his wings, little membranes that vibrate and make his song of  Katy did and Katy didn't.    [Illustration]    No, the little lady katydid cannot sing--only the little male, and he  keeps it up all night long.    We sometimes wish he would get tired or sleepy and stop, but he never  does.    Why do you suppose he likes to sing so well in the night?    The katydids generally live on trees and bushes.    Yes, they are a beautiful, pale green people, and that is one reason we  do not often see them. It is not easy to find a katydid among the green  leaves.    The female katydids have a long sword-shaped ovipositor with which they  roughen the bark on twigs, and place the eggs there, fastening them with  a gummy substance.    The egg"]]]
