Blessed, also, is he  that hath inhaled Thy sweet savors, and been carried away by Thine  utterances in Thy days. Blessed, moreover, be the man that hath turned  unto Thee, and woe betide him that hath turned his back upon Thee.    Praised be Thou, the Lord of the worlds!            XXXIX: \"O THOU WHO DEALEST EQUITABLY WITH ALL WHO ARE...\"      O Thou Who dealest equitably with all who are in heaven and on earth, and  rulest over the kingdom of Thy creation and of Thy Revelation! I testify  that every man of equity hath recognized his unfairness in the face of the  revelation of the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy Justice, and the ablest  of pens hath confessed its impotence before the movement of Thy most  exalted Pen.    By Thy life, O Thou the Possessor of all names! The minds of the  profoundest thinkers are sore perplexed as they contemplate the ocean of  Thy knowledge, and the heaven of Thy wisdom, and the Luminary of Thy  grace. How can he who is but a creation of Thy will claim to know what is  with Thee, or to conceive Thy nature?    Praise, immeasurable praise be to Thee! I swear by Thy glory! My inner and  outer tongue, openly and secretly, testify that Thou hast been exalted  above the reach and ken of Thy creatures, above the utterance of Thy  servants, above the testimonies of Thy dear ones and Thy chosen ones, and  the apprehension of Thy Prophets and of Thy Messengers.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Name which Thou hast made to be the  Day-Spring of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Place of Thine inspiration,  to ordain for this wronged One and for them that are dear to Thee what  becometh Thy loftiness. Thou, in very truth, art the All-Bountiful, the  All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.            XL: \"PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! I IMPLORE THEE,...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I implore Thee, by Thy Name which none  hath befittingly recognized, and whose import no soul hath fathomed; I  beseech Thee, by Him Who is the Fountain-Head of Thy Revelation and the  Day-Spring of Thy signs, to make my heart to be a receptacle of Thy love  and of remembrance of Thee. Knit it, then, to Thy most great Ocean, that  from it may flow out the living waters of Thy wisdom and the crystal  streams of Thy glorification and praise.    The limbs of my body testify to Thy unity, and the hair of my head  declareth the power of Thy sovereignty and might. I have stood at the door  of Thy grace with utter self-effacement and complete abnegation, and clung  to the hem of Thy bounty, and fixed mine eyes upon the horizon of Thy  gifts.    Do Thou destine for me, O my God, what becometh the greatness of Thy  majesty, and assist me, by Thy strengthening grace, so to teach Thy Cause  that the dead may speed out of their sepulchers, and rush forth towards  Thee, trusting wholly in Thee, and fixing their gaze upon the orient of  Thy Cause, and the dawning-place of Thy Revelation.    Thou, verily, art the Most Powerful, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.            XLI: \"THY UNITY IS INSCRUTABLE, O MY GOD, TO ALL EXCEPT...\"      Thy unity is inscrutable, O my God, to all except them that have  recognized Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy singleness and the  Day-Spring of Thy oneness. Whoso assigneth a rival unto Him hath assigned  a rival unto Thee, and whoso hath set up a peer for Him hath set up a peer  for Thyself. No, no, none can withstand Thee in the whole of creation.  Thou hast everlastingly been exalted far above all comparison and  likeness. Thy oneness hath been demonstrated by the oneness of Him Who is  the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation. Whosoever denieth this, hath denied  Thy unity, and disputed with Thee about Thy sovereignty, and contended  with Thee in Thy realm, and repudiated Thy commandments.    Assist Thou Thy servants, O my Lord, to recognize Thy unity and to declare  Thy oneness, that all may gather together around what Thou didst desire in  this Day whereon the sun of Thine essence hath shone forth above the  horizon of Thy will, and the moon of Thine own being hath risen from the  Day-Spring of Thy behest. Thou art He, O my Lord, from Whose knowledge  nothing whatsoever escapeth, and Whom no one can frustrate. Thou doest Thy  pleasure, by Thy sovereignty that overshadoweth the worlds.    Thou well knowest, O my God, my Best-Beloved, that naught can quench the  thirst I suffer in my separation from Thee except the waters of Thy  presence, and that the tumult of my heart can never be stilled save  through the living fountain of my reunion with Thee. Send down, then, upon  me, O my Lord, out of the heaven of Thy bounty what will draw me nearer  unto the chalice of Thy gifts, and make me able to quaff the choice sealed  Wine, Whose seal hath been loosed in Thy name, and from Which the sweet  savors of Thy days have been shed abroad. Thou, in truth, art the  All-Bountiful, Whose grace is infinite.    The whole universe testifieth to Thy generosity. Have mercy, then, upon me  by Thy graciousness, and deal bountifully with me through the power of Thy  sovereignty, and suffer me to enjoy near access to Thee by Thy manifold  favors. Thou, truly, art the Great Giver, the Almighty, the  Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.            XLII: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD AND THE GOD OF...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of all things, my Glory and the  Glory of all things, my Desire and the Desire of all things, my Strength  and the Strength of all things, my King and the King of all things, my  Possessor and the Possessor of all things, my Aim and the Aim of all  things, my Mover and the Mover of all things! Suffer me not, I implore  Thee, to be kept back from the ocean of Thy tender mercies, nor to be far  removed from the shores of nearness to Thee.    Aught else except Thee, O my Lord, profiteth me not, and near access to  any one save Thyself availeth me nothing. I entreat Thee by the  plenteousness of Thy riches, whereby Thou didst dispense with all else  except Thyself, to number me with such as have set their faces towards  Thee, and arisen to serve Thee.    Forgive, then, O my Lord, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens. Thou, truly,  art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.            XLIII: \"O GOD, WHO ART THE AUTHOR OF ALL MANIFESTATIONS,...\"      O God, Who art the Author of all Manifestations, the Source of all  Sources, the Fountain-Head of all Revelations, and the Well-Spring of all  Lights! I testify that by Thy Name the heaven of understanding hath been  adorned, and the ocean of utterance hath surged, and the dispensations of  Thy providence have been promulgated unto the followers of all religions.    I beseech Thee so to enrich me as to dispense with all save Thee, and be  made independent of any one except Thyself. Rain down, then, upon me out  of the clouds of Thy bounty that which shall profit me in every world of  Thy worlds. Assist me, then, through Thy strengthening grace, so to serve  Thy Cause amidst Thy servants that I may show forth what will cause me to  be remembered as long as Thine own kingdom endureth and Thy dominion will  last.    This is Thy servant, O my Lord, who with his whole being hath turned unto  the horizon of Thy bounty, and the ocean of Thy grace, and the heaven of  Thy gifts. Do with me then as becometh Thy majesty, and Thy glory, and Thy  bounteousness, and Thy grace.    Thou, in truth, art the God of strength and power, Who art meet to answer  them that pray Thee. There is no God save Thee, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.            XLIV: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O THOU WHO ART MY GOD...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Thou Who art my God and throbbest within my heart!  Thou art well aware and dost witness that whatsoever shameth them that are  dear to Thee must shame also Him Who is the Manifestation of Thyself and  the Day-Spring of Thy Revelation. Nay, He is put to greater shame than  they when they are led to confess the good things which have escaped them  in Thy days.    These are Thy servants, O my Lord, who for love of Thee have abandoned  their homes, and sustained the tribulations decreed by Thee in Thy path. I  swear by Thy glory! Every time any one of them testifieth before Thee to  his evil doings, shame covereth my face, for they are Thy servants who  have tasted of the cup of woe in Thy Cause, who have quaffed from the  chalice of adversity when the light of Thy countenance was lifted upon  them, and who were so vexed by trials that peace was utterly denied them  within the precincts of Thy court.    The power of Thy might beareth me witness! My heart hath melted by reason  of my love for them that are dear to Thee, and my soul is laden with  anguish for the sorrows which have afflicted them at the revelation of Thy  Cause and the appearance of the billowing oceans of Thy grace and favors.  The sighs they uttered, O my Lord, have caused my sighs to ascend towards  Thee, and the burning of their hearts hath consumed mine own heart within  me.    I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all being and the Enlightener  of all things visible and invisible, to grant that every one of them may  become an ensign of Thy guidance among Thy servants, and a revelation of  the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy loving-kindness amidst Thy creatures.  Thou hast, O my God, chosen them to love Thee, and to stand before the  throne of Thy majesty. No other station hath excelled the station to which  Thou hast called them. How many the nights, O my God, when sleep failed to  overtake them because of their remembrance of Thee, and how numerous the  days which they spent in lamentation over the things that have befallen  Thee at the hands of Thine enemies! I entreat Thee, O Thou Who art the  Ruler of rulers, and the Uplifter of the downtrodden, to aid them so to  assist Thy Cause and exalt Thy word that through them Thy praise may be  shed abroad amidst Thy creatures, and Thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#9)"],[1,"thee from God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Leave thou the world  behind thee, and turn towards thy Lord, through Whom the whole earth hath  been illumined... Dwellest thou in palaces whilst He Who is the King of  Revelation liveth in the most desolate of abodes? Leave them unto such as  desire them, and set thy face with joy and delight towards the Kingdom...  Arise in the name of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, amidst the peoples of the  earth, and seize thou the Cup of Life with the hands of confidence, and  first drink thou therefrom, and proffer it then to such as turn towards it  amongst the peoples of all faiths...    Call thou to remembrance Him Who was the Spirit (Jesus), Who when He came,  the most learned of His age pronounced judgment against Him in His own  country, whilst he who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take heed,  then, ye men of understanding heart! Thou, in truth, art one of the suns  of the heaven of His names. Guard thyself, lest darkness spread its veils  over thee, and fold thee away from His light... Consider those who opposed  the Son (Jesus), when He came unto them with sovereignty and power. How  many the Pharisees who were waiting to behold Him, and were lamenting over  their separation from Him! And yet, when the fragrance of His coming was  wafted over them, and His beauty was unveiled, they turned aside from Him  and disputed with Him... None save a very few, who were destitute of any  power amongst men, turned towards His face. And yet, today, every man  endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself on His  Name! In like manner, consider how numerous, in these days, are the monks  who, in My Name, have secluded themselves in their churches, and who, when  the appointed time was fulfilled, and We unveiled Our beauty, knew Us not,  though they call upon Me at eventide and at dawn....    The Word which the Son concealed is made manifest. It hath been sent down  in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be the Lord Who is  the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great  majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous... This  is the day whereon the Rock (Peter) crieth out and shouteth, and  celebrateth the praise of its Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most High,  saying: 'Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the  Kingdom is fulfilled!...' My body longeth for the cross, and Mine head  waiteth the thrust of the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful, that the  world may be purged from its transgressions....    O Supreme Pontiff! Incline thine ear unto that which the Fashioner of  mouldering bones counselleth thee, as voiced by Him Who is His Most Great  Name. Sell all the embellished ornaments thou dost possess, and expend  them in the path of God, Who causeth the night to return upon the day, and  the day to return upon the night. Abandon thy kingdom unto the kings, and  emerge from thy habitation, with thy face set towards the Kingdom, and,  detached from the world, then speak forth the praises of thy Lord betwixt  earth and heaven. Thus hath bidden thee He Who is the Possessor of Names,  on the part of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Exhort thou the  kings and say: 'Deal equitably with men. Beware lest ye transgress the  bounds fixed in the Book.' This indeed becometh thee. Beware lest thou  appropriate unto thyself the things of the world and the riches thereof.  Leave them unto such as desire them, and cleave unto that which hath been  enjoined upon thee by Him Who is the Lord of creation. Should any one  offer thee all the treasures of the earth, refuse to even glance upon  them. Be as thy Lord hath been. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken  that which God hath made the ornament of the book of creation... Should  the inebriation of the wine of My verses seize thee, and thou determinest  to present thyself before the throne of thy Lord, the Creator of earth and  heaven, make My love thy vesture and thy shield remembrance of Me, and thy  provision reliance upon God, the Revealer of all power... Verily, the day  of ingathering is come, and all things have been separated from each  other. He hath stored away that which He chose in the vessels of justice,  and cast into fire that which befitteth it. Thus hath it been decreed by  your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, in this promised Day. He, verily,  ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is none other God save He, the Almighty,  the All-Compelling.            THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE OF VARIOUS FAITHS          \"At one time We address the people of the Torah and summon...\"      At one time We address the people of the Torah and summon them unto Him  Who is the Revealer of verses, Who hath come from Him Who layeth low the  necks of men.... At another, We address the people of the Evangel and say:  'The All-Glorious is come in this Name whereby the Breeze of God hath  wafted over all regions.'... At still another, We address the people of  the Qur'an saying: 'Fear the All-Merciful, and cavil not at Him through  Whom all religions were founded.'... Know thou, moreover, that We have  addressed to the Magians Our Tablets, and adorned them with Our Law.... We  have revealed in them the essence of all the hints and allusions contained  in their Books. The Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing.          \"CALL out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the...\"      CALL out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was  hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is  manifest; His all-encompassing splendour is revealed. Beware lest thou  hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that  hath descended from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled  in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the company of  the most exalted angels. O how I long to announce unto every spot on the  surface of the earth, and to carry to each one of its cities, the  glad-tidings of this Revelation--a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai  hath been attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling: 'Unto  God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven.' Verily  this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement,  the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a  bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for  revelation. Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest  the people of Baha who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.          \"THE Most Great Law is come, and the Ancient Beauty...\"      THE Most Great Law is come, and the Ancient Beauty ruleth upon the throne  of David. Thus hath My Pen spoken that which the histories of bygone ages  have related. At this time, however, David crieth aloud and saith: 'O my  loving Lord! Do Thou number me with such as have stood steadfast in Thy  Cause, O Thou through Whom the faces have been illumined, and the  footsteps have slipped!'          \"THE Breath hath been wafted, and the Breeze hath...\"      THE Breath hath been wafted, and the Breeze hath blown, and from Zion hath  appeared that which was hidden, and from Jerusalem is heard the Voice of  God, the One, the Incomparable, the Omniscient.          \"LEND an ear unto the song of David. He saith: 'Who will...\"      LEND an ear unto the song of David. He saith: 'Who will bring me into the  Strong City?' The Strong City is Akka, which hath been named the Most  Great Prison, and which possesseth a fortress and mighty ramparts...  Peruse that which Isaiah hath spoken in His Book. He saith: 'Get thee up  into the high mountain, O Zion, that bringest good tidings; lift up thy  voice with strength, O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings. Lift it up,  be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah: \"Behold your God! Behold the  Lord God will come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him.\"'  This Day all the signs have appeared. A great City hath descended from  heaven, and Zion trembleth and exulteth with joy at the Revelation of God,  for it hath heard the Voice of God on every side.          \"O CONCOURSE of Christians! We have, on a previous...\"      O CONCOURSE of Christians! We have, on a previous occasion, revealed  Ourself unto you, and ye recognized Me not. This is yet another occasion  vouchsafed unto you. This is the Day of God; turn ye unto Him... The  Beloved One loveth not that ye be consumed with the fire of your desires.  Were ye to be shut out as by a veil from Him, this would be for no other  reason than your own waywardness and ignorance. Ye make mention of Me, and  know Me not. Ye call upon Me, and are heedless of My Revelation.... O  people of the Gospel! They who were not in the Kingdom have now entered  it, whilst We behold you, in this day, tarrying at the gate. Rend the  veils asunder by the power of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bounteous,  and enter, then, in My name My Kingdom. Thus biddeth you He Who desireth  for you everlasting life... We behold you, O children of the Kingdom, in  darkness. This, verily, beseemeth you not. Are ye, in the face of the  Light, fearful because of your deeds? Direct yourselves towards Him...  Verily, He (Jesus) said: 'Come ye after Me, and I will make you to become  fishers of men.' In this day, however, We say: 'Come ye after Me, that We  may make you to become quickeners of mankind.'          \"WE, verily, have come for your sakes, and have borne...\"      WE, verily, have come for your sakes, and have borne the misfortunes of  the world for your salvation. Flee ye the One Who hath sacrificed His life  that ye may be quickened? Fear God, O followers of the Spirit (Jesus), and  walk not in the footsteps of every divine that hath gone far astray...  Open the doors of your hearts. He Who is the Spirit (Jesus) verily,  standeth before them. Wherefore keep ye afar from Him Who hath purposed to  draw you nigh unto a"]]]
