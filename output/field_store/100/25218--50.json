In  composition with men's names, this deity occurs more than any other,  even including Merodach himself--a clear indication of the estimation  in which the Babylonians and Assyrians held the possession of  knowledge. The character with which his name is written means, with  the pronunciation of /ak/, \"to make,\" \"to create,\" \"to receive,\" \"to  proclaim,\" and with the pronunciation of /me/, \"to be wise,\" \"wisdom,\"  \"open of ear,\" \"broad of ear,\" and \"to make, of a house,\" the last  probably referring to the design rather than to the actual building.  Under the name of /Dim-sara/ he was \"the creator of the writing of the  scribes,\" as /Ni-zu/, \"the god who knows\" (/zu/, \"to know\"), as  /Mermer/, \"the speeder(?) of the command of the gods\"--on the Sumerian  side indicating some connection with Addu or Rimmon, the thunderer,  and on the Semitic side with Enu-restu, who was one of the gods'  messengers. A small fragment in the British Museum gave his attributes  as god of the various cities of Babylonia, but unfortunately their  names are lost or incomplete. From what remains, however, we see that  Nebo was god of ditching(?), commerce(?), granaries(?), fasting(?),  and food; it was he who overthrew the land of the enemy, and who  protected planting; and, lastly, he was god of Borsippa.    The worship of Nebo was not always as popular as it became in the  later days of the Babylonian empire and after its fall, and Jastrow is  of opinion that Hammurabi intentionally ignored this deity, giving the  preference to Merodach, though he did not suppress the worship. Why  this should have taken place is not by any means certain, for Nebo was  a deity adored far and wide, as may be gathered from the fact that  there was a mountain bearing his name in Moab, upon which Moses--also  an \"announcer,\" adds Jastrow--died. Besides the mountain, there was a  city in Moab so named, and another in Judaea. That it was the  Babylonian Nebo originally is implied by the form--the Hebrew  corresponding word is /nabi/.    How old the worship of Tasmetum, his consort, is, is doubtful, but her  name first occurs in a date of the reign of Hammurabi. Details  concerning her attributes are rare, and Jastrow regards this goddess  as the result of Babylonian religious speculations. It is noteworthy  that her worship appears more especially in later times, but it may be  doubted whether it is a product of those late times, especially when  we bear in mind the remarkable seal-impression on an early tablet of  3500-4500 B.C., belonging to Lord Amherst of Hackney, in which we see  a male figure with wide-open mouth seizing a stag by his horns, and a  female figure with no mouth at all, but with very prominent ears,  holding a bull in a similar manner. Here we have the \"teacher\" and the  \"hearer\" personified in a very remarkable manner, and it may well be  that this primitive picture shows the idea then prevailing with regard  to these two deities. It is to be noted that the name of Tasmetum has  a Sumerian equivalent, namely, /Kurnun/, and that the ideograph by  which it is represented is one whose general meaning seems to be \"to  bind,\" perhaps with the additional signification of \"to accomplish,\"  in which case \"she who hears\" would also be \"she who obeys.\"                              Samas and his consort.    At all times the worship of the sun in Babylonia and Assyria was  exceedingly popular, as, indeed, was to be expected from his  importance as the greatest of the heavenly bodies and the brightest,  without whose help men could not live, and it is an exceedingly  noteworthy fact that this deity did not become, like Ra in Egypt, the  head of the pantheon. This place was reserved for Merodach, also a  sun-god, but possessing attributes of a far wider scope. Samas is  mentioned as early as the reign of E-anna-tum, whose date is set at  about 4200 B.C., and at this period his Semitic name does not,  naturally, occur, the character used being /Utu/, or, in its longer  form, /Utuki/.    It is worthy of note that, in consequence of the Babylonian idea of  evolution in the creation of the world, less perfect beings brought  forth those which were more perfect, and the sun was therefore the  offspring of Nannara or Sin, the moon. In accordance with the same  idea, the day, with the Semites, began with the evening, the time when  the moon became visible, and thus becomes the offspring of the night.  In the inscriptions Samas is described as \"the light of things above  and things below, the illuminator of the regions,\" \"the supreme judge  of heaven and earth,\" \"the lord of living creatures, the gracious one  of the lands.\" Dawning in the foundation of the sky, he opened the  locks and threw wide the gates of the high heavens, and raised his  head, covering heaven and earth with his splendour. He was the  constantly righteous in heaven, the truth within the ears of the  lands, the god knowing justice and injustice, righteousness he  supported upon his shoulders, unrighteousness he burst asunder like a  leather bond, etc. It will thus be seen, that the sun-god was the  great god of judgment and justice--indeed, he is constantly alluded to  as \"the judge,\" the reason in all probability being, that as the sun  shines upon the earth all day long, and his light penetrates  everywhere, he was regarded as the god who knew and investigated  everything, and was therefore best in a position to judge aright, and  deliver a just decision. It is for this reason that his image appears  at the head of the stele inscribed with Hammurabi's laws, and legal  ceremonies were performed within the precincts of his temples. The  chief seats of his worship were the great temples called E-babbara,  \"the house of great light,\" in the cities of Larsa and Sippar.    The consort of Samas was Aa, whose chief seat was at Sippar, side by  side with Samas. Though only a weak reflex of the sun-god, her worship  was exceedingly ancient, being mentioned in an inscription of  Man-istusu, who is regarded as having reigned before Sargon of Agade.  From the fact that, in one of the lists, she has names formed by  reduplicating the name of the sun-god, /Utu/, she would seem once to  have been identical with him, in which case it may be supposed that  she personified the setting sun--\"the double sun\" from the magnified  disc which he presents at sunset, when, according to a hymn to the  setting sun sung at the temple at Borsippa, Aa, in the Sumerian line  Kur-nirda, was accustomed to go to receive him. According to the list  referred to above, Aa, with the name of Burida in Sumerian, was more  especially the consort of Sa-zu, \"him who knows the heart,\" one of the  names of Merodach, who was probably the morning sun, and therefore the  exact counterpart of the sun at evening.    Besides Samas and Utu, the latter his ordinary Sumerian name, the  sun-god had several other non-Semitic names, including /Gisnu/,[*] \"the  light,\" /Ma-banda-anna/, \"the bark of heaven,\" /U-e/, \"the rising  sun,\" /Mitra/, apparently the Persian Mithra; /Ume-simas/ and Nahunda,  Elamite names, and Sahi, the Kassite name of the sun. He also  sometimes bears the names of his attendants Kittu and Mesaru, \"Truth\"  and \"Righteousness,\" who guided him upon his path as judge of the  earth.    [*] It is the group expressing this word which is used for Samas in      the name of Samas-sum-ukin (Saosduchinos), the brother of      Assur-bani-apli (Assurbanipal). The Greek equivalent implies the      pronunciation /Sawas/, as well as /Samas/.                                Tammuz and Istar.    The date of the rise of the myth of Tammuz is uncertain, but as the  name of this god is found on tablets of the time of Lugal-anda and  Uru-ka-gina (about 3500 B.C.), it can hardly be of later date than  4000 B.C., and may be much earlier. As he is repeatedly called \"the  shepherd,\" and had a domain where he pastured his flock, Professor  Sayce sees in Tammuz \"Daonus or Daos, the shepherd of Pantibibla,\"  who, according to Berosus, ruled in Babylonia for 10 /sari/, or 36,000  years, and was the sixth king of the mythical period. According to the  classic story, the mother of Tammuz had unnatural intercourse with her  own father, being urged thereto by Aphrodite whom she had offended,  and who had decided thus to avenge herself. Being pursued by her  father, who wished to kill her for this crime, she prayed to the gods,  and was turned into a tree, from whose trunk Adonis was afterwards  born. Aphrodite was so charmed with the infant that, placing him in a  chest, she gave him into the care of Persephone, who, however, when  she discovered what a treasure she had in her keeping, refused to part  with him again. Zeus was appealed to, and decided that for four months  in the year Adonis should be left to himself, four should be spent  with Aphrodite, and four with Persephone, and six with Aphrodite on  earth. He was afterwards slain, whilst hunting, by a wild boar.    Nothing has come down to us as yet concerning this legend except the  incident of his dwelling in Hades, whither Istar, the Babylonian  Venus, went in search of him. It is not by any means unlikely,  however, that the whole story existed in Babylonia, and thence spread  to Phoenicia, and afterwards to Greece. In Phoenicia it was adapted to  the physical conditions of the country, and the place of Tammuz's  encounter with the boar was said to be the mountains of Lebanon,  whilst the river named after him, Adonis (now the Nahr Ibrahim), which  ran red with the earth washed down by the autumn rains, was said to be  so coloured in consequence of being mingled with his blood.

Reckon there's been some queer happenin's 'round heah lately.  If  Shepp could talk he'd shore have lots to tell us.  Bill an' Guy have  been sleepin' out, trailin' strange hoss tracks, an' all that.  But  shore whoever's been prowlin' around heah was too sharp for them.  Some  bad, crafty, light-steppin' woodsmen 'round heah, Jean.... Three  mawnin's ago, just after daylight, I stepped out the back door an' some  one of these sneaks I'm talkin' aboot took a shot at me.  Missed my  head a quarter of an inch! To-morrow I'll show you the bullet hole in  the doorpost.  An' some of my gray hairs that 're stickin' in it!\"    \"Dad!\" ejaculated Jean, with a hand outstretched.  \"That's awful! You  frighten me.\"    \"No time to be scared,\" replied his father, calmly.  \"They're shore  goin' to kill me.  That's why I wanted you home.... In there with you,  now!  Go to sleep.  You shore can trust Shepp to wake you if he gets  scent or sound.... An' good night, my son.  I'm sayin' that I'll rest  easy to-night.\"    Jean mumbled a good night and stood watching his father's shining white  head move away under the starlight.  Then the tall, dark form vanished,  a door closed, and all was still.  The dog Shepp licked Jean's hand.  Jean felt grateful for that warm touch.  For a moment he sat on his  roll of bedding, his thought still locked on the shuddering revelation  of his father's words, \"They're shore goin' to kill me.\"  The shock of  inaction passed.  Jean pushed his pack in the dark opening and,  crawling inside, he unrolled it and made his bed.    When at length he was comfortably settled for the night he breathed a  long sigh of relief.  What bliss to relax!  A throbbing and burning of  his muscles seemed to begin with his rest.  The cool starlit night, the  smell of cedar, the moan of wind, the silence--an were real to his  senses.  After long weeks of long, arduous travel he was home.  The  warmth of the welcome still lingered, but it seemed to have been  pierced by an icy thrust.  What lay before him?  The shadow in the eyes  of his aunt, in the younger, fresher eyes of his sister--Jean connected  that with the meaning of his father's tragic words.  Far past was the  morning that had been so keen, the breaking of camp in the sunlit  forest, the riding down the brown aisles under the pines, the music of  bleating lambs that had called him not to pass by. Thought of Ellen  Jorth recurred.  Had he met her only that morning? She was up there in  the forest, asleep under the starlit pines. Who was she?  What was her  story?  That savage fling of her skirt, her bitter speech and  passionate flaming face--they haunted Jean. They were crystallizing  into simpler memories, growing away from his bewilderment, and  therefore at once sweeter and more doubtful. \"Maybe she meant  differently from what I thought,\" Jean soliloquized. \"Anyway, she was  honest.\"  Both shame and thrill possessed him at the recall of an  insidious idea--dare he go back and find her and give her the last  package of gifts he had brought from the city?  What might they mean to  poor, ragged, untidy, beautiful Ellen Jorth?  The idea grew on Jean.  It could not be dispelled.  He resisted stubbornly. It was bound to go  to its fruition.  Deep into his mind had sunk an impression of her  need--a material need that brought spirit and pride to abasement.  From  one picture to another his memory wandered, from one speech and act of  hers to another, choosing, selecting, casting aside, until clear and  sharp as the stars shone the words, \"Oh, I've been kissed before!\"  That stung him now.  By whom?  Not by one man, but by several, by many,  she had meant.  Pshaw! he had only been sympathetic and drawn by a  strange girl in the woods.  To-morrow he would forget.  Work there was  for him in Grass Valley.  And he reverted uneasily to the remarks of  his father until at last sleep claimed him.    A cold nose against his cheek, a low whine, awakened Jean.  The big dog  Shepp was beside him, keen, wary, intense.  The night appeared far  advanced toward dawn.  Far away a cock crowed; the near-at-hand one  answered in clarion voice.  \"What is it, Shepp?\" whispered Jean, and he  sat up.  The dog smelled or heard something suspicious to his nature,  but whether man or animal Jean could not tell.        CHAPTER III    The morning star, large, intensely blue-white, magnificent in its  dominance of the clear night sky, hung over the dim, dark valley  ramparts. The moon had gone down and all the other stars were wan, pale  ghosts.    Presently the strained vacuum of Jean's ears vibrated to a low roar of  many hoofs.  It came from the open valley, along the slope to the  south.  Shepp acted as if he wanted the word to run.  Jean laid a hand  on the dog.  \"Hold on, Shepp,\" he whispered.  Then hauling on his boots  and slipping into his coat Jean took his rifle and stole out into the  open.  Shepp appeared to be well trained, for it was evident that he  had a strong natural tendency to run off and hunt for whatever had  roused him.  Jean thought it more than likely that the dog scented an  animal of some kind.  If there were men prowling around the ranch  Shepp, might have been just as vigilant, but it seemed to Jean that the  dog would have shown less eagerness to leave him, or none at all.    In the stillness of the morning it took Jean a moment to locate the  direction of the wind, which was very light and coming from the south.  In fact that little breeze had borne the low roar of trampling hoofs.  Jean circled the ranch house to the right and kept along the slope at  the edge of the cedars.  It struck him suddenly how well fitted he was  for work of this sort.  All the work he had ever done, except for his  few years in school, had been in the open.  All the leisure he had ever  been able to obtain had been given to his ruling passion for hunting  and fishing.  Love of the wild had been born in Jean.  At this moment  he experienced a grim assurance of what his instinct and his training  might accomplish if directed to a stern and daring end.  Perhaps his  father understood this; perhaps the old Texan had some little reason  for his confidence.    Every few paces Jean halted to listen.  All objects, of course, were  indistinguishable in the dark-gray obscurity, except when he came close  upon them.  Shepp showed an increasing eagerness to bolt out into the  void.  When Jean had traveled half a mile from the house he heard a  scattered trampling of cattle on the run, and farther out a low  strangled bawl of a calf.  \"Ahuh!\" muttered Jean.  \"Cougar or some  varmint pulled down that calf.\"  Then he discharged his rifle in the  air and yelled with all his might.  It was necessary then to yell again  to hold Shepp back.    Thereupon Jean set forth down the valley, and tramped out and across  and around, as much to scare away whatever had been after the stock as  to look for the wounded calf.  More than once he heard cattle moving  away ahead of him, but he could not see them.  Jean let Shepp go,  hoping the dog would strike a trail.  But Shepp neither gave tongue nor  came back.  Dawn began to break, and in the growing light Jean searched  around until at last he stumbled over a dead calf, lying in a little  bare wash where water ran in wet seasons.  Big wolf tracks showed in  the soft earth.  \"Lofers,\" said Jean, as he knelt and just covered one  track with his spread hand.  \"We had wolves in Oregon, but not as big  as these.... Wonder where that half-wolf dog, Shepp, went.  Wonder if  he can be trusted where wolves are concerned. I'll bet not, if there's  a she-wolf runnin' around.\"    Jean found tracks of two wolves, and he trailed them out of the wash,  then lost them in the grass.  But, guided by their direction, he went  on and climbed a slope to the cedar line, where in the dusty patches he  found the tracks again.  \"Not scared much,\" he muttered, as he noted  the slow trotting tracks.  \"Well, you old gray lofers, we're goin' to  clash.\"  Jean knew from many a futile hunt that wolves were the wariest  and most intelligent of wild animals in the quest.  From the top of a  low foothill he watched the sun rise; and then no longer wondered why  his father waxed eloquent over the beauty and location and luxuriance  of this grassy valley.  But it was large enough to make rich a good  many ranchers.  Jean tried to restrain any curiosity as to his father's  dealings in Grass Valley until the situation had been made clear.    Moreover, Jean wanted to love this wonderful country.  He wanted to be  free to ride and hunt and roam to his heart's content; and therefore he  dreaded hearing his father's claims.  But Jean threw off forebodings.  Nothing ever turned out so badly as it presaged.  He would think the  best until certain of the worst.  The morning was gloriously bright,  and already the frost was glistening wet on the stones.  Grass Valley  shone like burnished silver dotted with innumerable black spots. Burros  were braying their discordant messages to one another; the colts were  romping in the fields; stallions were whistling; cows were bawling.  A  cloud of blue smoke hung low over the ranch house, slowly wafting away  on the wind.  Far out in the valley a dark group of horsemen were  riding toward the village.  Jean glanced thoughtfully at them and  reflected that he seemed destined to harbor suspicion of all men new  and strange to him.  Above the distant village stood the darkly green  foothills leading up to the craggy slopes, and these ending in the Rim,  a red, black-fringed mountain front, beautiful in the morning sunlight,  lonely, serene, and mysterious against the level skyline.  Mountains,  ranges, distances unknown to Jean, always called to him--to come, to  seek, to explore, to find, but no wild horizon ever before beckoned to  him as this one.  And the subtle vague emotion that had gone to"]]]
