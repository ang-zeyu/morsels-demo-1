This was a change, on the part of both men, from the manners of the  previous day; and yet I could not help thinking that each but ill  concealed his aversion to the other.    Months now slipped away, and Mr. Bransome was occupied in going up and  down the coast in a little steamer, shutting up factory after factory,  transferring their goods to ours, and getting himself much disliked by  all the Europeans under him, and hated by the natives, especially by  the boat-boys, who were a race or tribe by themselves, coming from one  particular part of the coast. He had, of course, been obliged to order  the dismissal of many of them, and this was one reason why they hated  him; but the chief cause was his treatment of Sooka, the patrao. That  man never forgave Mr. Bransome for beating him so unjustly; and the  news of the deed had travelled very quickly, as news does in savage  countries, so that I think nearly all of Sooka's countrymen knew of the  act and resented it.    Mr. Bransome was quite unaware of the antipathy he had thus created  toward himself, except so far as Sooka was concerned; and him he never  employed when he had to go off to vessels or land from them, but always  went in the other boat belonging to the factory, which was steered by a  much younger negro. In addition to humbling Sooka in this way, Bransome  took the opportunity of disgracing him whenever he could do so.  Therefore, one day when two pieces of cloth from the cargo-room were  found in the boatmen's huts, it was no surprise to me that Sooka was at  once fastened upon by Mr. Bransome as the thief who had stolen them,  and that he was tied to the flogging-post in the middle of the yard, and  sentenced to receive fifty lashes with the cat that was kept for such  a purpose, and all without any inquiry being made. In vain did the  unfortunate man protest his innocence. A swarthy Kroot-boy from Cape  Coast laid the cat on his brown shoulders right willingly, for he also  was an enemy of Sooka's; and in a few minutes the poor fellow's flesh  was cut and scored as if by a knife.    After the flogging was over Mr. Bransome amused himself by getting out  his rifle and firing fancy shots at Sooka, still tied to the post; that  is, he tried to put the bullets as close to the poor wretch as he could  without actually wounding him. To a negro, with his dread of firearms,  this was little short of absolute torture, and at each discharge Sooka  writhed and crouched as close to the ground as he could, while his  wide-opened eyes and mouth, and face of almost a slate colour, showed  how terribly frightened he was. To Mr. Bransome it appeared to be  fine sport, for he fired at least twenty shots at the man before he  shouldered his rifle and went indoors. Jackson said nothing to this  stupid exhibition of temper, but as soon as it was over he had Sooka  released; and I knew he attended to his wounds himself, and poured  friar's balsam into them, and covered his back with a soft shirt--for  all which, no doubt, the negro was afterward grateful. Whether Mr.  Bransome got to know of this, and was offended at it, I do not know, but  shortly afterward he ceased to live with us.    There was between the factory and the sea, and a little to the right of  the former, a small wooden cottage which had been allowed to fall into a  dilapidated state from want of some one to live in it. This Mr. Bransome  gave orders to the native carpenters to repair and make weather-tight;  and when they had done so, he caused a quantity of furniture to be  brought from St. Paul de Loanda and placed within in it. Then he  transferred himself and his baggage to the cottage.    Jackson displayed complete indifference to this change on the part of  the agent. In fact, there had been, ever since the arrival of the latter  upon the Point, and in spite of apparent friendliness, a perceptible  breach, widening daily, between the two men. As to the reason of this I  had my own suspicions, for I had made the discovery that Jackson had for  some time past been drinking very heavily.    In addition to the brandy which we white men had for our own use, I had,  to my horror, found out that he was secretly drinking the coarse  and fiery rum that was sold to the natives; and as I remembered the  mutterings and moanings that had formerly alarmed me, I wondered that I  had not guessed the cause of them at the time; but until the arrival of  Mr. Bransome, Jackson had always kept charge of the spirits himself, and  he was such a secret old fellow that there was no knowing what he had  then taken. Now that I was aware of his failing, I was very sorry for  the old sailor; for on such a coast and in such a climate there was only  one end to it; and although I could not actually prevent him from taking  the liquor, I resolved to watch him, and if such symptoms as I had seen  before again appeared, to tell Mr. Bransome of them at all hazards. But  I was too late to prevent what speedily followed my discovery. It had  come about that the same mail-steamer that had brought out Mr. Bransome  had again anchored off the Point, and again the weather was coarse and  lowering. A stiff breeze had blown for some days, which made the rollers  worse than they had been for a long while. Both Mr. Bransome and Jackson  watched the weather with eager looks, but each was differently affected  by it. Bransome appeared to be anxious and nervous, while Jackson was  excited, and paced up and down the veranda, and kept, strange to say,  for it was contrary to his late habit, a watch upon Bransome's every  movement.    Every now and then, too, he would rub his hands together as if in eager  expectation, and would chuckle to himself as he glanced seaward. Of his  own accord he gave orders to Sooka to get both the surf-boats ready for  launching, and to make the boys put on their newest loin-cloths; and  then, when everything was in readiness, he asked Bransome if he was  going off to the steamer.    \"I fear I must,\" said Bransome; \"but I--I don't like the look of those  cursed rollers.\"    At this Jackson laughed, and said something about \"being afraid of very  little.\"    \"The beach is perfectly good,\" he added; \"Sooka knows, and Sooka is the  oldest patrao on the Point.\"    And Sooka, who was standing by, made a low obeisance to the agent, and  said that \"the beach lived for well,\" which was his way of expressing in  English that the sea was not heavy.    At that moment a gun was fired from the steamer as a signal to be quick,  and Bransome said, \"I will go, but not in that black blackguard's boat;  it need not come,\" and he went down to the beach.    It was one of Jackson's rules that when a boat went through the surf  there should be some one to watch it, so I walked to the end of the  Point to see the agent put off. He got away safely; and I, seeing  Sooka's boat lying on the beach, and thinking that it would be as well  to have it hauled up under the boat-shed, was on the point of returning  to the factory to give the necessary order, when, to my surprise, I saw  the boat's crew rush down the beach to the boat and begin to push it  toward the sea.    I waved my arms as a signal to them to stop, but they paid no attention  to me; and I saw them run the boat into the water, jump into her, and  pull off, all singing a song to their stroke in their own language,  the sound of which came faintly up to the top of the Point. \"Stupid  fellows!\" I muttered to myself, \"they might have known that the boat  was not wanted;\" and I was again about to turn away, when I was suddenly  seized from behind, and carried to the very edge of the cliff, and then  as suddenly released.    I sprang to one side, and turning round saw Jackson, with a look of such  savage fury on his face that I retreated a step or two in astonishment  at him. He perceived my alarm, and burst out into a fit of laughter,  which, instead of reassuring me, had the opposite effect, it was  so demoniacal in character. \"Ha! ha!\" he laughed again, \"are you  frightened?\" and advancing toward me, he put his face close to mine,  peering into it with bloodshot eyes, while his breath, reeking of  spirits, poured into my nostrils.    Involuntarily I put up my arm to keep him off. He clutched it, and,  pointing with his other hand to the sea, whispered hoarsely, \"What do  you hear of the surf? Will the breakers be heavier before sundown? See  how they begin to curve! Listen how they already thunder, thunder,  on the beach! I tell you they are impatient--they seek some one,\" he  shouted. \"Do you know,\" he continued, lowering his voice again, and  speaking almost confidentially, \"sooner or later some one is drowned  upon that bar?\" And even as he spoke a fresh line of breakers arose from  the deep, farther out than any had been before. This much I observed,  but I was too greatly unnerved by the strange manner of Jackson to pay  further heed to the sea. It had flashed across my mind that he was on  the verge of an attack of delirium tremens, from the effects of the  liquor he had been consuming for so long, and the problem was to get him  back to the house quietly.    Suddenly a thought struck me. Putting my arm within his, I said,  as coolly as I could, \"Never mind the sea, Jackson; let us have a  _matabicho_\" (our local expression for a \"drink\"). He took the bait, and  came away quietly enough to the house. Once there, I enticed him into  the dining-room, and shutting to the door quickly, I locked it on the  outside, resolving to keep him there until Mr. Bransome should return;  for, being alone, I was afraid of him.    Then I went back to the end of the Point to look for the return of the  two boats. When I reached it I saw that the rollers had increased  in size in the short time that I had been absent, and that they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"or invalidity of his election were set at  rest by the ceremony of coronation (Dec. 1135).    (M74)    In the spring of the following year (April 1136), a brilliant council of  the clergy and magnates of the realm was held in London,(111) reminding  one of the Easter courts of the days of the Conqueror which latterly had  been shorn of much of their splendour. The occasion was one for  introducing the new king to his subjects as well as for confirming the  liberties of the church, and Stephen may have taken special care to  surround it with exceptional splendour as a set off against the meagreness  which had characterised the recent ceremony of his coronation.(112)    (M75)    In the meanwhile the injured Matilda appealed to Rome, but only with the  result that her rival received formal recognition from the Pope. Three  years later (1139) she landed in England accompanied by her brother, the  Earl of Gloucester. She soon obtained a following, more especially in the  west; and Winchester--the seat of the royal residence of the queens of  England since the time when Ethelred presented the city as a \"morning  gift\" to his consort at their marriage--became her headquarters and  rallying point for her supporters, whilst London served in the same way  for Stephen.    (M76)    After nine months of sieges and counter sieges, marches and counter  marches, in which neither party could claim any decided success, Stephen,  as was his wont, withdrew to London and shut himself up in the Tower, with  only a single bishop, and he a foreigner, in his train. Whilst safe behind  the walls of that stronghold, negotiations were opened between him and the  empress for a peaceful settlement of their respective claims (May, 1140),  Henry of Winchester acting as intermediary between the rival parties.(113)  The negotiations ended without effecting the desired result.    (M77)    Matters assumed an entirely different aspect when Stephen was made  prisoner at Lincoln in the following year (2nd Feb., 1141). Henry of  Winchester forsook his role of arbitrator, and entered into a formal  compact with the empress who arrived before Winchester with the laurels of  her recent success yet fresh, agreeing to receive her as \"Lady of  England,\" (_Domina Angliae_) and promising her the allegiance of himself  and his followers so long as she would keep her oath and allow him a free  hand in ecclesiastical matters.(114)    (M78)    This compact was entered into on the 2nd March, and on the following day  the empress was received with solemn pomp into Winchester Cathedral. It  remained for the compact to be ratified. For this purpose an  ecclesiastical synod was summoned to sit at Winchester on the 7th April.  The day was spent by the legate holding informal communications with the  bishops, abbots, and archdeacons who were in attendance, and who then for  the first time in England's history claimed the right not only of  consecration, but of election of the sovereign.(115)    On the 8th April, Henry in a long speech announced to the assembled clergy  the result of the conclave of the previous day. He extolled the good  government of the late king who before his death had caused fealty to be  sworn to his daughter, the empress. The delay of the empress in coming to  England (he said) had been the cause of Stephen's election. The latter had  forfeited all claim to the crown by his bad government, and God's judgment  had been pronounced against him. Lest therefore, the nation should suffer  for want of a sovereign, he, as legate, had summoned them together, and by  them the empress had been elected Lady of England. The speech was received  with unanimous applause, those to whom the election did not commend itself  being wise enough to hold their tongue.    (M79)    But there was another element to be considered before Matilda's new title  could be assured. What would the Londoners who had taken the initiative in  setting Stephen on the throne, and still owed to them their allegiance,  say to it? The legate had foreseen the difficulty that might arise if the  citizens, whom he described as very princes of the realm, by reason of the  greatness of their city (_qui sunt quasi optimates pro magnitudine  civitatis in Anglia_), could not be won over. He had, therefore, sent a  special safe conduct for their attendance, so he informed the meeting  after the applause which followed his speech had died away, and he  expected them to arrive on the following day. If they pleased they would  adjourn till then.    (M80)    The next day (9th April) the Londoners arrived, as the legate had  foretold, and were ushered before the council. They had been sent, they  said, by the so called \"commune\" of London; and their purpose was not to  enter into debate, but only to beg for the release of their lord, the  king.(116) The statement was supported by all the barons then present who  had entered the commune of the city(117) and met with the approval of the  archbishop and all the clergy in attendance. Their solicitations, however,  proved of no avail. The legate replied with the same arguments he had used  the day before, adding that it ill became the Londoners who were regarded  as nobles (_quasi proceres_) in the land to foster those who had basely  deserted their king on the field of battle, and who only curried favour  with the citizens in order to fleece them of their money.    (M81)    Here an interruption took place. A messenger presented to the legate a  paper from Stephen's queen to read to the council. Henry took the paper,  and after scanning its contents, refused to communicate them to the  meeting. The messenger, however, not to be thus foiled, himself made known  the contents of the paper. These were, in effect, an exhortation by the  queen to the clergy, and more especially to the legate himself, to restore  Stephen to liberty. The legate, however, returned the same answer as  before, and the meeting broke up, the Londoners promising to communicate  the decision of the council to their brethren at home, and to do their  best to obtain their support.    (M82)    The next two months were occupied by the empress and her supporters in  preparing the way for her admission into the city, the inhabitants of  which, had as yet shown but little disposition towards her. But however  great their inclination may have been to Stephen, they at length found  themselves forced to transfer their allegiance and to offer, for a time at  least, a politic submission to the empress. Accordingly, a deputation went  out to meet her at St. Albans (May 1141), and arrange terms on which the  city should surrender.(118)    More delay took place; and it was not until shortly before midsummer  (1141), that she entered the city. Her stay was brief. She treated the  inhabitants as vanquished foes,(119) extorted large sums of money,(120)  and haughtily refused to observe the laws of Edward the Confessor they  valued so much, preferring those of the late king, her father.(121)    (M83)    The consequence was that, within a few days of her arrival in London, the  inhabitants rose in revolt, drove her out of the city(122) and attacked  the Tower, of which Geoffrey de Mandeville was constable, as his father  William had been before him.(123)    (M84)    This Geoffrey de Mandeville had been recently created Earl of Essex by  Stephen, in the hope and expectation that the fortress over which Geoffrey  was governor, would be held secure for the royal cause. The newly fledged  earl, however, was one who ever fought for his own hand, and was ready to  sell his fortress and sword to the highest bidder. The few days that the  empress was in the city, afforded her an opportunity of risking a trial to  win over the earl from his allegiance. To this end she offered to confirm  him in his earldom and to continue him in his office of Constable of the  Tower, conferred upon him by Stephen; in addition to which, she was ready  to allow him to enjoy lands of the rent of L100 a year, a license to  fortify his castles, and the posts of sheriff and justiciar throughout his  earldom. The bait was too tempting for the earl not to accept; and a  charter to the above effect was drawn up and executed.(124)    (M85)    Scarcely had the fickle earl consented to throw in his lot with the  empress before she had to flee the city. The departure of the empress was  quickly followed by the arrival of her namesake, Matilda, the valiant  queen of the captured Stephen; and again the earl proved false to his  allegiance and actively supported the queen in concert with the  citizens.(125)    (M86)    With his aid(126) and the aid of the Londoners,(127) the queen was enabled  to reduce Winchester and to effect the liberation of her husband by  exchanging the Earl of Gloucester, brother of the empress, for the  captured king.    (M87)    After being solemnly crowned, for the second time,(128) at Canterbury,  Stephen issued a second charter (about Christmas time, 1141),(129) to  Geoffrey de Mandeville, confirming and augmenting the previous grant by  the empress. Instead of sheriff and justiciar of his own county of Essex  merely, he is now made sheriff and justiciar of London and Middlesex, as  well as of Hertfordshire.    (M88)    But even these great concessions failed to secure the earl's fidelity to  the king. Again he broke away from his allegiance and planned a revolt in  favour of the empress who recompensed him with still greater dignities and  possessions than any yet bestowed. This second charter of the  empress,(130) is remarkable for a clause in which she promises never to  make terms with the Londoners without the earl's consent, \"because they  are his mortal foes.\"(131) But the plans of the earl were doomed to be  frustrated. The empress, tired of the struggle, soon ceased to be  dangerous, and eventually withdrew to the continent, and Stephen was left  free to deal with the rebel earl alone. With the"]]]
