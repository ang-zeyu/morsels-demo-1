Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in  th' head.\"    Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her  think several entirely new things.    She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha  had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone down-stairs. She was  thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the  library. She did not care very much about the library itself, because  she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind  the hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all  really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them.  Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many doors  she could count? It would be something to do on this morning when she  could not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission to do  things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not  have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk about  the house, even if she had seen her.    She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she  began her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into other  corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to  others again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the  walls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but  oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes  made of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whose  walls were covered with these portraits. She had never thought there  could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this place and  stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as if  they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their  house. Some were pictures of children--little girls in thick satin  frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys  with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs  around their necks. She always stopped to look at the children, and  wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore  such odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like  herself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her  finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.    \"Where do you live now?\" said Mary aloud to her. \"I wish you were here.\"    Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed  as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small  self, wandering about up-stairs and down, through narrow passages and  wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever  walked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in  them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it  true.    It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of  turning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock  had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of  them and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt  that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door  itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and opened  into a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and  inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room. A  broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the  mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed  to stare at her more curiously than ever.    \"Perhaps she slept here once,\" said Mary. \"She stares at me so that she  makes me feel queer.\"    After that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that  she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred,  though she had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures  or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were curious  pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.    In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings were  all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little  elephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had  their mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than  the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had  seen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She opened  the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these  for quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants in  order and shut the door of the cabinet.    In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms,  she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just  after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.  It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from  which it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion,  and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole  peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.    Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to a  little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and  made a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near  her. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were  seven mice who did not look lonely at all.    \"If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me,\" said  Mary.    She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any  farther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way by  turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down  until she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor  again, though she was some distance from her own room and did not know  exactly where she was.    \"I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,\" she said, standing still  at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall. \"I  don't know which way to go. How still everything is!\"    It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that  the stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not quite  like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a  fretful, childish whine muffled by passing through walls.    \"It's nearer than it was,\" said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.  \"And it _is_ crying.\"    She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then  sprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of a  door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the  corridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of  keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.    \"What are you doing here?\" she said, and she took Mary by the arm and  pulled her away. \"What did I tell you?\"    \"I turned round the wrong corner,\" explained Mary. \"I didn't know which  way to go and I heard some one crying.\"    She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more the  next.    \"You didn't hear anything of the sort,\" said the housekeeper. \"You come  along back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears.\"    And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one  passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own  room.    \"Now,\" she said, \"you stay where you're told to stay or you'll find  yourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same as  he said he would. You're one that needs some one to look sharp after  you. I've got enough to do.\"    She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went  and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground  her teeth.    \"There _was_ some one crying--there _was_--there _was_!\" she said to  herself.    She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She had  found out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on a  long journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the  time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray  mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.          CHAPTER VII    THE KEY OF THE GARDEN      Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed  immediately, and called to Martha.    \"Look at the moor! Look at the moor!\"    The rain-storm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept  away in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a  brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had  Mary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing; this  was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters  of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the  arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The  far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of  gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.    \"Aye,\" said Martha with a cheerful grin. \"Th' storm's over for a bit. It  does like this at this time o' th' year. It goes off in a night like it  was pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again.  That's because th' springtime's on its way. It's a long way off yet, but  it's comin'.\"    \"I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,\" Mary  said.    \"Eh! no!\" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead  brushes. \"Nowt o' th' soart!\"    \"What does that mean?\" asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spoke  different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#9)"],[1,"ench,\"  Slim observed ponderously. \"There ain't any water. What's the use uh  talking foolish?\"    \"They're going to tackle it, just the same,\" Andy pointed out patiently.    \"Well, by golly, if you ain't just lyin' to hear yourself, that there  graftin' bunch had oughta be strung up!\"    \"Sure, they had. Nobody's going to argue about that. But seeing we can't  do that, the next best thing is to beat them to it. If they came out  here with their herd of pilgrims and found the land all took up--\" Andy  smiled hypnotically upon the goggling group.    \"Haw-haw-haw-w!\" bawled Big Medicine. \"It'd be wuth it, by cripes!\"    \"Yeah--it would, all right. If that talk Andy's been giving us is  straight, about grazing the land instead uh working it--\"    \"You can mighty quick find out,\" Andy retorted. \"Go up and ask Chip  for them land laws, and that plat. And ask him what he thinks about the  deal. You don't have to take my word for it.\" Andy grinned virtuously  and pushed back his chair. From their faces, and the remarks they had  made, he felt very confident of the ultimate decision. \"What about you,  Patsy?\" he asked suddenly, turning to the bulky, bald German cook who  was thumping bread dough in a far corner. \"You got any homestead or  desert rights you ain't used?\"    \"Py cosh, I got all der rights dere iss,\" Patsy returned querulously.  \"I got more rights as you shmartys. I got soldier's rights mit fightin'.  Und py cosh, I use him too if dem fellers coom by us mit der dry farms  alreatty!\"    \"Well, you son-of-a-gun!\" Andy smote him elatedly upon a fat shoulder.  \"What do you know about old Patsy for a dead game sport? By gracious,  that makes another three hundred and twenty to the good. Gee, it's lucky  this bunch has gone along turning up their noses at nesters and thinkin'  they couldn't be real punchers and hold down claims too. If any of us  had had sense enough to grab a piece of land and settle down to raise  families, we'd be right up against it now. We'd have to set back and  watch a bunch of down-east rubes light down on us like flies on spilt  molasses, and we couldn't do a thing.\"    \"As it is, we'll all turn nesters for the good of the cause!\" finished  Pink somewhat cynically, getting up and following Cal and Slim to the  door.    \"Aw, I betche they's some ketch to it!\" gloomed Happy Jack. \"I betche  Andy jest wants to see us takin' up claims on that dry bench, and then  set back and laugh at us fer bitin' on his josh.\"    \"Well, you'll have the claims, won't you. And if you hang onto them  there'll be money in the deal some day. Why, darn your bomb-proof skull,  can't you get it into your system that all this country's bound to  settle up?\" Andy's eyes snapped angrily. \"Can't you see the difference  between us owning the land between here and the mountains, and a bunch  of outsiders that'll cut it all up into little fields and try to farm  it. If you can't see that, you better go hack a hole in your head with  an axe, so an idea can squeeze in now and then when you ain't looking!\"    \"Well, I betche there ain't no colony comin' to settle that there  bench,\" Happy Jack persisted stubbornly.    \"Yes there is, by cripes!\" trumpeted Big Medicine behind him. \"Yes there  is! And that there colony is goin' to be us, and don't you forget it.  It's time I was doin' somethin' fer that there boy uh mine, by cripes!  And soon as we git that fence strung I'm goin' to hit the trail fer the  nearest land office. Honest to grandma, if Andy's lyin' it's goin' to be  the prof't'blest lie HE ever told, er anybody else. I don't care a cuss  about whether them dry-farmers is fixin' to light here or not. That  there land-pool looks good to ME, and I'm comin' in on it with all four  feet!\"    Big Medicine was nothing less than a human land slide when once he threw  himself into anything, be it a fight or a frolic. Now he blocked the  way to the door with his broad shoulders and his big bellow and his  enthusiasm, and his pale, frog-like eyes fixed their protruding stare  accusingly upon the reluctant ones.    \"Cal, you git up there and git that plat and bring it here,\" he ordered.  \"And fer criminy sakes git that table cleared off, Patsy, so's't we kin  have a place to lay it! What's eatin' on you fellers, standin' around  like girls to a party, waitin' fer somebody to come up and ast you to  dance! Ain't you got head enough to see what a cinch we got, if we only  got sense enough to play it! Honest to grandma you make me sick to look  at yuh! Down in Conconino County the boys wouldn't stand back and wait  to be purty-pleased into a thing like this. You're so scared Andy's got  a josh covered up somewheres, you wouldn't take a drink uh whisky if he  ast yuh up to the bar! You'd pass up a Chris'mas turkey, by cripes, if  yuh seen Andy washin' his face and lookin' hungry! You'd--\"    What further reproach he would have heaped upon them was interrupted by  Chip, who opened the door just then and bumped Big Medicine in the back.  In his hand Chip carried the land plat and the pamphlets, and in his  keen, brown eyes he carried the light of battle for his outfit. The eyes  of Andy Green sent bright glances from him to Big Medicine, and on  to the others. He was too wise then to twit those others with their  unbelief. His wisdom went farther than that; for he remained very  much in the background of the conversation and contented himself with  answering, briefly and truthfully, the questions they put to him about  Florence Grace Hallman and the things she had so foolishly divulged  concerning her plans.    Chip spread the plat upon an end of the table hastily and effectually  cleared by a sweep of Big Medicine's arm, and the Happy Family crowded  close to stare down at the checker-board picture of their own familiar  bench land. They did not doubt, now--nor did they Hang back reluctantly.  Instead they followed eagerly the trail Chip's cigarette-yellowed finger  took across the map, and they listened intently to what he said about  that trail.    The clause about grazing the land, he said, simplified matters a whole  lot. It was a cinch you couldn't turn loose and dry-farm that land and  have even a fair chance of reaping a harvest. But as grazing land they  could hold all the land along One Man Creek--and that was a lot. And the  land lying back of that, and higher up toward the foothills, they  could take as desert. And he maintained that Andy had been right in  his judgment: If they all went into it and pulled together they  could stretch a line of claims that would protect the Badland grazing  effectually.    \"I wouldn't ask you fellows to go into this,\" said Chip, straightening  from his stooping over the map and looking from one sober face to  another, \"just to help the outfit. But it'll be a good thing for you  boys. It'll give you a foothold--something better than wages, if you  stay with your claims and prove up. Of course, I can't say anything  about us buying out your claims--that's fraud, according to Hoyle;  but you ain't simple-minded--you know your land won't be begging for a  buyer, in case you should ever want to sell.    \"There's another thing. This will not only head off the dry-farmers  from overstocking what little range is left--it'll make a dead-line for  sheep, too. We've been letting 'em graze back and forth on the bench  back here beyond our leased land, and not saying much, so long as they  didn't crowd up too close, and kept going. With all our claims under  fence, do you realize what that'll mean for the grass?\"    \"Josephine! There's feed for considerable stock, right over there on our  claims, to say nothing of what we'll cover,\" exclaimed Pink.    \"I'd tell a man! And if we get water on the desert claims--\" Chip  grinned down at him. \"See what we've been passing up, all this time.  We've had some of it leased, of course--but that can't be done again.  There's been some wire-pulling, and because we ain't politicians we got  turned down when the Old Man wanted to renew the lease. I can see now  why it was, maybe. This dry-farm business had something to do with it,  if you ask me.\"    \"Gee whiz! And here we've been calling Andy a liar,\" sighed Cal Emmett.    \"Aw, jest because he happened to tell the truth once, don't cut no ice,\"  Happy Jack maintained with sufficient ambiguity to avert the natural  consequences.    \"Of course, it won't be any gold-mine,\" Chip added dispassionately.  \"But it's worth picking up, all right; and if it'll keep out a bunch  of tight-fisted settlers that don't give a darn for anything but what's  inside their own fence, that's worth a lot, too.\"    \"Say, my dad's a farmer,\" Pink declared defiantly in his soft treble.  \"And while I think of it, them eastern farmers ain't so worse--not the  brand I've seen, anyway. They're narrow, maybe--but they're human.  Damn it, you fellows have got to quit talking about 'em as if they were  blackleg stock or grasshoppers or something.\"    \"We ain't saying nothing aginst farmers AS farmers, Little One\" Big  Medicine explained forebearingly. \"As men, and as women, and as kids,  they're mighty nice folks. My folks have got an eighty-acre farm in  Wisconsin,\" he confessed unexpectedly, \"and I think a pile of 'em. But  if they was to come out here, trying to horn in on our range, I'd lead  'em gently to the railroad, by cripes, and tell 'em goodbye so's't  they'd know I meant it! Can't yuh see the difference?\" he bawled,  goggling at Pink with misleading savageness in his ugly face.    \"Oh, I see,\" Pink admitted mildly. \"I only just wanted to remind you  fellows that I don't mean anything personal and I don't want you to.  Say, what about One Man Coulee?\" he asked suddenly. \"That's marked  vacant on the map. I always thought--\"    \"Sure, you did!\" Chip grinned at him wisely, \"because we used it for  a line camp, you thought we owned a deed to it. Well, we don't. We had  that land leased, is all.\"    \"Say, by golly, I'll file on that,"]]]
