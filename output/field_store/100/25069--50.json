The Plymouth Colony was now often called the Old Colony, because it  had been settled first. After many years, these two colonies were  united, and still later they became the state of Massachusetts.

How other New England colonies grew up; the Revolution.--By the  time Governor Winthrop arrived, English settlements had been made  in Maine, New Hampshire, and later (1724), in the country which  afterward became the state of Vermont. Connecticut and Rhode Island  were first settled by emigrants who went from Massachusetts.    When the Revolution broke out, the people throughout New England took  up arms in defence of their rights. The first blood of the war was  shed on the soil of Massachusetts, near Boston.      75. Summary.--The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, New England, in 1620.  One of the chief men who came with them was Captain Myles Standish.  Had it not been for his help, the Indians might have destroyed the  settlement. In 1630, Governor John Winthrop, with a large company  of emigrants from England, settled Boston. Near Boston the first  battle of the Revolution was fought.      Why did some Englishmen in Holland call themselves Pilgrims? Why had  they left England? Why did they now wish to go to America? Who was  Myles Standish? From what place in England, and in what ship, did  the Pilgrims sail? What land did they first see in America? What did  they do at Cape Cod Harbor? What did the Pilgrims do on the Cape?  Where did they land on December 21st, 1620? What happened during the  winter? What is said of Samoset? What about Squanto? What about  Massasoit? What did Massasoit and Governor Carver do? What about the  first Thanksgiving? What is said about Canonicus and Governor  Bradford? What did the Pilgrims build to protect them from the  Indians? What is said about Weymouth? What did Myles Standish do  there? What else did Myles Standish do besides fight? What is said  of his death? What did Governor John Winthrop do? What did the people  of New England do in the Revolution? Where was the first blood shed?          LORD BALTIMORE  (1580-1632).      76. Lord Baltimore's settlement in Newfoundland; how Catholics were  then treated in England.--While Captain Myles Standish was helping  build up Plymouth, Lord Baltimore, an English nobleman, was trying  to make a settlement on the cold, foggy island of Newfoundland.    Lord Baltimore had been brought up a Protestant, but had become a  Catholic. At that time, Catholics were treated very cruelly in  England. They were ordered by law to attend the Church of England.  They did not like that church any better than the Pilgrims did; but  if they failed to attend it, they had to take their choice between  paying a large sum of money or going to prison.    Lord Baltimore hoped to make a home for himself and for other English  Catholics in the wilderness of Newfoundland, where there would be  no one to trouble them. But the unfortunate settlers were fairly  frozen out. They had winter a good share of the year, and fog all  of it. They could raise nothing, because, as one man said, the soil  was either rock or swamp: the rock was as hard as iron; the swamp  was so deep that you could not touch bottom with a ten-foot pole.      77. The king of England gives Lord Baltimore part of Virginia, and  names it Maryland; what Lord Baltimore paid for it.--King Charles  the First of England was a good friend to Lord Baltimore; and when  the settlement in Newfoundland was given up, he made him a present  of an immense three-cornered piece of land in America. This piece  was cut out of Virginia, north of the Potomac[1] River.    The king's wife, who was called Queen Mary, was a French Catholic.  In her honor, Charles named the country he had given Lord Baltimore,  Mary Land, or Maryland. He could not have chosen a better name,  because Maryland was to be a shelter for many English people who  believed in the same religion that the queen did.    [Illustration: TWO INDIAN ARROWS.]    All that Lord Baltimore was to pay for Maryland, with its twelve  thousand square miles of land and water, was two Indian arrows. These  he agreed to send every spring to the royal palace of Windsor[2]  Castle, near London.    [Illustration: PART OF WINDSOR CASTLE.]    The arrows would be worth nothing whatever to the king; but they were  sent as a kind of yearly rent. They showed that, though Lord Baltimore  had the use of Maryland, and could do pretty much as he pleased with  it, still the king did not give up all control of it. In Virginia  and in New England the king had granted all land to companies of  persons, and he had been particular to tell them just what they must  or must not do; but he gave Maryland to one man only. More than this,  he promised to let Lord Baltimore have his own way in everything,  so long as he made no laws in Maryland which should be contrary to  the laws of England. So Lord Baltimore had greater privileges than  any other holder of land in America at that time.    [Footnote 1: Potomac (Po-to'mak): see map, paragraph 140.]    [Footnote 2: Windsor (Win'zor).]      78. Lord Baltimore dies; his son sends emigrants to Maryland; the  landing; the Indians; St. Mary's.--Lord Baltimore died before he  could get ready to come to America. His eldest son then became Lord  Baltimore. He sent over a number of emigrants; part of them were  Catholics, and part were Protestants: all of them were to have equal  rights in Maryland. In the spring of 1634, these people landed on  a little island near the mouth of the Potomac River. There they cut  down a tree, and made a large cross of it; then, kneeling round that  cross, they all joined in prayer to God for their safe journey.    [Illustration: THE LANDING IN MARYLAND.]    A little later, they landed on the shore of the river. There they  met Indians. Under a huge mulberry-tree they bargained with the  Indians for a place to build a town, and paid for the land in hatchets,  knives, and beads.    The Indians were greatly astonished at the size of the ship in which  the white men came. They thought that it was made like their canoes,  out of the trunk of a tree hollowed out, and they wondered where the  English could have found a tree big enough to make it.    The emigrants named their settlement St. Mary's, because they had  landed on a day kept sacred to the Virgin Mary.[3] The Indians gave  up one of their largest wigwams to Father White, one of the priests  who had come over, and he made a church of it. It was the first English  Catholic Church which was opened in America.    [Illustration: Map of Maryland and Virginia.]    The Indians and the settlers lived and worked together side by side.  The red men showed the emigrants how to hunt in the forest, and the  Indian women taught the white women how to make hominy, and to bake  johnny-cake before the open fire.    [Footnote 3: March 25th: Annunciation or Lady Day.]      79. Maryland the home of religious liberty.--Maryland was different  from the other English colonies in America, because there, and there  only, every Christian, whether Catholic or Protestant, had the right  to worship God in his own way. In that humble little village of St.  Mary's, made up of thirty or forty log huts and wigwams in the woods,  \"religious liberty had its only home in the wide world.\"    But more than this, Lord Baltimore generously invited people who had  been driven out of the other settlements on account of their religion  to come and live in Maryland. He gave a hearty welcome to all, whether  they thought as he did or not. Thus he showed that he was a noble  man by nature as well as a nobleman by name.      80. Maryland falls into trouble; the city of Baltimore built.--But  this happy state of things did not last long. Some of the people of  Virginia were very angry because the king had given Lord Baltimore  part of what they thought was their land. They quarrelled with the  new settlers and made them a great deal of trouble.    Then worse things happened. Men went to Maryland and undertook to  drive out the Catholics. In some cases they acted in a very shameful  manner toward Lord Baltimore and his friends; among other things,  they put Father White in irons and sent him back to England as a  prisoner. Lord Baltimore had spent a great deal of money in building  up the settlement, but his right to the land was taken away from him  for a time, and all who dared to defend him were badly treated.    St. Mary's never grew to be much of a place, but not quite a hundred  years after the English landed there a new and beautiful city was  begun (1729) in Maryland. It was named Baltimore, in honor of that  Lord Baltimore who sent out the first emigrants. When the  Revolutionary War broke out, the citizens of Baltimore showed that  they were not a bit behind the other colonies of America in their  spirit of independence.      81. Summary.--King Charles the First of England gave Lord Baltimore,  an English Catholic, a part of Virginia and named it Maryland, in  honor of his wife, Queen Mary. A company of emigrants came out to  Maryland in 1634. It was the first settlement in America in which  all Christian people had entire liberty to worship God in whatever  way they thought right. That liberty they owed to Lord Baltimore.      Who was Lord Baltimore, and what did he try to do in Newfoundland?  How were Catholics then treated in England?

He is rendered absolutely  incapable of defending himself. He fails to realise what is said against  him or the significance of his own words.    His brain is the first to succumb to the strain, utter loneliness  speedily conducing to this result, aggravated by a sensation which is  produced by walking the cell, and which I will describe later.  Consequently he invariably achieves with his own mouth what his  persecutors desire--his own condemnation. To make their devilry  complete German justice resorts to a final phase which seals the fate of  the poor wretch irrevocably, as I will narrate.    I had been deprived of every belonging. I was denied paper, pencil and  reading material. Solitary confinement in Germany is carried out in  strict accordance with the interpretation of the term. One is left alone  with one's thoughts. At intervals of ten minutes the gaoler opens the  peep-hole and peers within. Consequently you are under constant  surveillance, and this contributes towards the unhinging of the mind.  Night and day, without a break, the peep-hole opens with mechanical  regularity. Not only is all mental exercise denied but physical exercise  as well. All that one can do towards stretching one's limbs is to pace  the tiny cell. The method is typically Prussian, and is complete in its  Prussian thoroughness and devilishness.    I sat down upon my bed with my bleeding, aching head in my hands, an  object of abject misery. Not a sound beyond the clanging of doors was to  be heard, punctuated at frequent intervals by the dull thud of blows, as  some hapless wretch was being clubbed, the shrieks and howls of  prisoners, and the groans of those on the verge of insanity. It was just  as if all the demons of the Nether Regions were at work worrying and  harrying their victims. While rocking myself to and fro I heard the  turning of the key. The gaoler entered with a bowl containing some  evil-looking and worse smelling soup. I ventured to speak, but he merely  glowered threateningly and departed without uttering a sound. The dinner  was revolting, but recognising that I was considered to be a criminal,  and as such was condemned to prison fare I ventured to taste the  nauseous skilly. I took one mouthful. My nose rebelled at the smell and  my stomach rose into my throat at the taste. One sip was more than  adequate, so I pushed the basin to one side. I threw myself upon the  plank bed. Ten minutes later the peep-hole opened. I took no notice but  started when a gruff voice roared \"Get up!\"    I ignored the command. The door opened and the guard came in. He gave me  a savage prod with his rifle. I sat up.    \"Get up! Pace!\" he roared.    I relapsed on to my bed without a murmur only to receive a resounding  clout which set my head throbbing once more with accentuated intensity.    \"Get up! Pace!\" came the roar again.    The guard pointed to the floor.    I saw what was expected of me. I was to walk to and fro up and down the  cell. I was not to be allowed to sit down. Wearily I got up and started  to \"pace!\" One--two--steps forward: one--two--steps back! Only that and  no more. The guard watched me for a few seconds and then went out.    I continued to do his bidding for a short while, but walking two paces,  then swinging round on the heels, taking two more strides, turning round  again, to make another two steps, soon brought on violent giddiness. But  that doesn't matter to the German. Within a few minutes I felt as if I  had been spun round like a top and stumbled rather than paced. But to  stumble was to court disaster because my ankles came into violent  contact with the plank bed. Again I had to keep my thoughts centred upon  the pacing. To allow them to stray was to essay a third step  inadvertently which brought my face into violent collision with the  wall. More than once I made my nose bleed copiously from this cause.    Within a few minutes my brain was whirling madly, my head throbbed from  my wound, while my face was bruised from colliding with the wall. I was  so giddy that I could not stand erect, while my eyes burned and ached as  if they had been seared with a red-hot iron. I fell upon the plank bed,  but open flew the peep-hole and again rang out the ominous growl,  \"Pace!\"    And this is what I was condemned to do hour after hour through the  livelong day. The only respite comes when meals are brought in and  during the night, when the prisoner is left alone. But throughout the  day, from 6.30 in the morning to about 7 at night one must pursue the  eternal round--two paces forward, right about, two paces back, right  about, and so on. The punishment cannot be escaped; it is not suspended  for illness until collapse comes to the relief of the hapless wretch. It  is a refinement of cruelty which probably is not to be found in any  other country. Little wonder that the continued dizziness and lack of  ability to stretch the limbs bring about a complete nervous prostration  and reduce the strongest man to a physical wreck within a very short  time. And if the hapless prisoner declines to answer the stern command  \"Pace!\" then bayonet prodding, clubbing and head-cuffing are brought  into action as a stimulant.    Ages seemed to have passed before the door opened again, although as a  matter of fact, there is only about 4-1/2 hours between the mid-day and  the afternoon meals. I lost all account of time, even during the first  day of my incarceration. An hour's pacing seemed like weeks. This time  the gaoler brought me another basin containing a greenish liquid, very  much like the water in which cabbages are cooked, accompanied by a hunk  of black bread.    The method of serving the meals is distinctly German. The gaoler opens  the door. He places the food on the ground at the entrance and pushes it  along the floor into the cell as if the inmate were a leper. I tasted  this repast, but it was even more noisome than the dinner, so I placed  it beside the bowl which I had first received, and which with its spoon  was left with me. Even if one could have swallowed it I should not have  received a very sustaining meal, seeing that it had to suffice until  5.30 the next morning--13 hours without food. Moreover the food is  served out sparingly. It is not designed to nourish the frame, but is  just sufficient to keep it going though with depreciating strength.    Daylight waned to give way to the blackness of night and in my cell I  could not see my hand before my face. Yet darkness was not an  unmitigated evil. It did bring relief from the enforced pacing for which  I was devoutly thankful. Although torn with hunger I was so exhausted as  to jump at the opportunity to lie down. But the planks were hard, and  being somewhat slender in build my thighs speedily became sore. My brain  from the fiendish exercise refused to stop spinning. I was like a  drunken man and to lie down was to provoke a feeling of nausea which was  worse than pacing. Then as the night wore on I began to shiver with the  cold because I was denied any covering. How I passed the first night I  cannot recall, but I am certain that a greater part of the time passed  in delirium, and I almost cried with delight when I saw the first rays  of the breaking day filter through the window. They at least did modify  the terrible darkness.    At 5.30 in the morning along came the gaoler. The cell was opened and a  broom was thrust into my hands. To me that domestic utensil was as a new  toy to a child. I grasped it with delight: it at least would give me  some occupation. I set to sweeping the cell furiously. I could have  enjoyed the company of that broom for hours, but a prisoner is only  allowed two minutes to sweep his cell. Then the broom was snatched out  of my hands and to the droning of \"Pace!\" which rang out continually  like the tolling of a funeral bell, I knew the next day had begun.    I fell back on to my bed almost broken at heart at being deprived of the  humble broom. But by now the significance of German solitary confinement  had been brought home to me fully. I would not be broken. I would ward  off the terrible results at all hazards. So when the gaoler came with my  breakfast he found me in high spirits--assumed for the occasion I may  say. When he pushed in the basin of skilly I picked it up and set it  beside the others. Pointing to the row of untouched food I turned to him  cynically and remarked, \"Don't you think you're making too much fuss of  me?\"    \"Ach!\" he growled in reply.    \"If you persist in going on like this I shall think I am in a nursing  home!\"    \"Ach!\" he retorted sharply, \"If you think you are in a nursing home  you'll soon change your mind,\" saying which he slammed the door with  extra vigour.    The only interlude to the daily round is shortly after sweeping cells.  The doors are thrown open and each prisoner, armed with his water jug  and sanitary pan, forms up in line in the corridor. They are spaced two  paces apart and this distance must be rigorously maintained. If you vary  it a fraction a smart rap over the head with the rifle brings you back  again to the correct position. The German warders never attempt to  correct by words. The rifle is a handy weapon and a smart knock  therewith is always forceful. Consequently, if you are dull of  comprehension, your body speedily assumes a zebra appearance with its  patches of black and blue.    We were marched off to a huge yard flanked by a towering wall studded  with hundreds of heavily barred windows--cells. Only those resident in  the \"Avenue of the Damned\" experience this limited latitude, the  ordinary prisoners being extended the privilege of ordinary exercise.  Not a word must be spoken; to do so is to invite a crash over the head,  insensibility being an effective protection against communication  between prisoners.    Reaching"]]]
