Mammy wove a lot of dat cloth and de clothes made out of  it sho would keep out de cold. Most of our stockin's and socks was knit  at home, but now and den somebody would git hold of a sto-bought pair  for Sunday-go-to-meetin' wear.    \"Colored folkses went to church wid deir own white folkses and sot in de  gallery. One Sunday us was all settin' in dat church listenin' to de  white preacher, Mr. Hansford, tellin' how de old debbil was gwine to git  dem what didn't do right.\" Here Neal burst into uncontrollable laughter.  His sides shook and tears ran down his face. Finally he began his story  again: \"Missy, I jus' got to tell you 'bout dat day in de meetin' 'ouse.  A Nigger had done run off from his marster and was hidin' out from one  place to another. At night he would go steal his somepin t'eat. He had  done stole some chickens and had 'em wid him up in de church steeple  whar he was hidin' dat day. When daytime come he went off to sleep lak  Niggers will do when dey ain't got to hustle, and when he woke up  Preacher Hansford was tellin' 'em 'bout de debbil was gwine to git de  sinners. Right den a old rooster what he had stole up and crowed so loud  it seemed lak Gabriel's trumpet on Judment Day. Dat runaway Nigger was  skeered 'cause he knowed dey was gwine to find him sho, but he warn't  skeered nuffin' compared to dem Niggers settin' in de gallery. Dey jus'  knowed dat was de voice of de debbil what had done come atter 'em. Dem  Niggers never stopped prayin' and testifyin' to de Lord, 'til de white  folkses had done got dat runaway slave and de rooster out of de steeple.  His marster was der and tuk him home and give him a good, sound  thrashin'.    \"Slaves was 'lowed to have prayermeetin' on Chuesday (Tuesday) and  Friday 'round at de diffunt plantations whar deir marsters didn't keer,  and dere warn't many what objected. De good marsters all give deir  slaves prayermeetin' passes on dem nights so de patterollers wouldn't  git 'em and beat 'em up for bein' off deir marster's lands. Dey 'most  nigh kilt some slaves what dey cotch out when dey didn't have no pass.  White preachers done de talkin' at de meetin'houses, but at dem Chuesday  and Friday night prayermeetin's, it was all done by Niggers. I was too  little to 'member much 'bout dem meetin's, but my older sisters used to  talk lots 'bout 'em long atter de war had brung our freedom. Dere warn't  many slaves what could read, so dey jus' talked 'bout what dey had done  heared de white preachers say on Sunday. One of de fav'rite texties was  de third chapter of John, and most of 'em jus' 'membered a line or two  from dat. Missy, from what folkses said 'bout dem meetin's, dere was sho  a lot of good prayin' and testifyin', 'cause so many sinners repented  and was saved. Sometimes at dem Sunday meetin's at de white folkses'  church dey would have two or three preachers de same dey. De fust one  would give de text and preach for at least a hour, den another one would  give a text and do his preachin', and 'bout dat time another one would  rise up and say dat dem fust two brudders had done preached enough to  save 3,000 souls, but dat he was gwine to try to double dat number. Den  he would do his preachin' and atter dat one of dem others would git up  and say: 'Brudders and Sisters, us is all here for de same and only  purpose--dat of savin' souls. Dese other good brudders is done preached,  talked, and prayed, and let the gap down; now I'm gwine to raise it. Us  is gwine to git 'ligion enough to take us straight through dem pearly  gates. Now, let us sing whilst us gives de new brudders and sisters de  right hand of fellowship. One of dem old songs went sort of lak dis:      'Must I be born to die     And lay dis body down?'    \"When dey had done finished all de verses and choruses of dat dey  started:      'Amazin' Grace, How sweet de sound     Dat saved a wretch lak me.'    \"'Fore dey stopped dey usually got 'round to singin':      'On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,     And cast a wishful eye,     To Canaan's fair and happy land     Whar my possessions lie.'    \"Dey could keep dat up for hours and it was sho' good singin', for dat's  one thing Niggers was born to do--to sing when dey gits 'ligion.    \"When old Aunt Flora come up and wanted to jine de church she told 'bout  how she had done seed de Hebenly light and changed her way of livin'.  Folkses testified den 'bout de goodness of de Lord and His many  blessin's what He give to saints and sinners, but dey is done stopped  givin' Him much thanks any more. Dem days, dey 'zamined folkses 'fore  dey let 'em jine up wid de church. When dey started 'zaminin' Aunt  Flora, de preacher axed her: 'Is you done been borned again and does you  believe dat Jesus Christ done died to save sinners?' Aunt Flora she  started to cry; and she said: 'Lordy, Is He daid? Us didn't know dat. If  my old man had done 'scribed for de paper lak I told him to, us would  have knowed when Jesus died?\" Neal giggled. \"Missy,\" he said, \"ain't dat  jus' lak one of dem old-time Niggers? Dey jus' tuk dat for ign'ance and  let her come on into de church.    \"Dem days it was de custom for marsters to hire out what slaves dey had  dat warn't needed to wuk on deir own land, so our marster hired out two  of my sisters. Sis' Anna hired to a fambly 'bout 16 miles from our  place. She didn't lak it dar so she run away and I found her hid out in  our 'tater 'ouse. One day when us was playin' she called to me right low  and soft lak and told me she was hongry and for me to git her somepin  t'eat but not to tell nobody she was dar. She said she had been dar  widout nothin' t'eat for several days. She was skeered Marster might  whup her. She looked so thin and bad I thought she was gwine to die, so  I told Mammy. Her and Marster went and brung Anna to de 'ouse and fed  her. Dat pore chile was starved most to death. Marster kept her at home  for 3 weeks and fed her up good, den he carried her back and told dem  folkses what had hired her dat dey had better treat Anna good and see  dat she had plenty t'eat. Marster was drivin' a fast hoss dat day, but  bless your heart, Anna beat him back home dat day. She cried and tuk on  so, beggin' him not to take her back dar no more dat he told her she  could stay home. My other sister stayed on whar she was hired out 'til  de war was over and dey give us our freedom.    \"Daddy had done hid all Old Marster's hosses when de yankees got to our  plantation. Two of de ridin' hosses was in de smokehouse and another  good trotter was in de hen 'ouse. Old Jake was a slave what warn't right  bright. He slep' in de kitchen, and he knowed whar Daddy had hid dem  hosses, but dat was all he knowed. Marster had give Daddy his money to  hide too, and he tuk some of de plasterin' off de wall in Marster's room  and put de box of money inside de wall. Den he fixed dat plasterin' back  so nice you couldn't tell it had ever been tore off. De night dem  yankees come, Daddy had gone out to de wuk 'ouse to git some pegs to fix  somepin (us didn't have no nails dem days). When de yankees rid up to de  kitchen door and found Old Jake right by hisself, dat pore old fool was  skeered so bad he jus' started right off babblin' 'bout two hosses in de  smoke'ouse and one in de hen 'ouse, but he was tremblin' so he couldn't  talk plain. Old Marster heared de fuss dey made and he come down to de  kitchen to see what was de matter. De yankees den ordered Marster to git  'em his hosses. Marster called Daddy and told him to git de hosses, but  Daddy, he played foolish lak and stalled 'round lak he didn't have good  sense. Dem sojers raved and fussed all night long 'bout dem hosses, but  dey never thought 'bout lookin' in de smoke'ouse and hen 'ouse for 'em  and 'bout daybreak dey left widout takin' nothin'. Marster said he was  sho proud of my Daddy for savin' dem good hosses for him.    [TR: 'Horses saved' written in margin.]    \"Marster had a long pocketbook what fastened at one end wid a ring. One  day when he went to git out some money he dropped a roll of bills dat he  never seed, but Daddy picked it up and handed it back to him right away.  Now my Daddy could have kept dat money jus' as easy, but he was a  'ceptional man and believed evvbody ought to do right.    \"Aunt Tama's old man, Uncle Griff, come to live wid her on our place  atter de war was over. 'Fore den he had belonged to a man named  Colquitt.[HW: !!] Marster pervided a home for him and Aunt Tama 'til dey  was both daid. When dey was buildin' de fust colored Methodist church in  dat section Uncle Griff give a whole hundred dollars to de buildin'  fund. Now it tuk a heap of scrimpin' for him to save dat much money  'cause he never had made over $10 a month. Aunt Tama had done gone to  Glory a long time when Uncle Griff died. Atter dey buried him dey come  back and was 'rangin' de things in his little cabin. When dey moved dat  little trunk what Aunt Tama used to keep gingerbread in, dey found jus'  lots of money in it. Marster tuk keer of dat money 'til he found Uncle  Griff's own sister and den he give it all to her.    \"One time Marster missed some of his money and he didn't want to 'cuse  nobody, so he 'cided he would find out who had done de debbilment. He  put a big rooster in a coop wid his haid stickin' out. Den he called all  de Niggers up to de yard and told 'em somebody had been stealin' his  money, and dat evvybody must git in line and march 'round dat coop and  tetch it. He said dat when de guilty ones tetched it de old rooster  would crow. Evvybody tetched it 'cept one old man and his wife; dey jus'  wouldn't come nigh dat coop whar dat rooster was a-lookin' at evvybody  out of his little red eyes. Marster had dat old man and 'oman sarched  and found all de money what had been stole.    \"Mammy died about a year atter de war, and I never will forgit how  Mist'ess cried and said: 'Neal, your mammy is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#9)"],[1," a third season,  indifferent seed and a wet harvest robbed him at once of half his  crop: he seems to have regarded this as an intimation from above, that  nothing which he undertook would prosper: and consoled himself with  joyous friends and with the society of the muse. The judgment cannot  be praised which selected a farm with a wet cold bottom, and sowed it  with unsound seed; but that man who despairs because a wet season robs  him of the fruits of the field, is unfit for the warfare of life,  where fortitude is as much required as by a general on a field of  battle, when the tide of success threatens to flow against him. The  poet seems to have believed, very early in life, that he was none of  the elect of Mammon; that he was too much of a genius ever to acquire  wealth by steady labour, or by, as he loved to call it, gin-horse  prudence, or grubbing industry.    And yet there were hours and days in which Burns, even when the rain  fell on his unhoused sheaves, did not wholly despair of himself: he  laboured, nay sometimes he slaved on his farm; and at intervals of  toil, sought to embellish his mind with such knowledge as might be  useful, should chance, the goddess who ruled his lot, drop him upon  some of the higher places of the land. He had, while he lived at  Tarbolton, united with some half-dozen young men, all sons of farmers  in that neighbourhood, in forming a club, of which the object was to  charm away a few evening hours in the week with agreeable chit-chat,  and the discussion of topics of economy or love. Of this little  society the poet was president, and the first question they were  called on to settle was this, \"Suppose a young man bred a farmer, but  without any fortune, has it in his power to marry either of two women;  the one a girl of large fortune, but neither handsome in person, nor  agreeable in conversation, but who can manage the household affairs of  a farm well enough; the other of them, a girl every way agreeable in  person, conversation, and behaviour, but without any fortune, which of  them shall he choose?\" This question was started by the poet, and once  every week the club were called to the consideration of matters  connected with rural life and industry: their expenses were limited to  threepence a week; and till the departure of Burns to the distant  Mossgiel, the club continued to live and thrive; on his removal it  lost the spirit which gave it birth, and was heard of no more; but its  aims and its usefulness were revived in Mauchline, where the poet was  induced to establish a society which only differed from the other in  spending the moderate fines arising from non-attendance, on books,  instead of liquor. Here, too, Burns was the president, and the members  were chiefly the sons of husbandmen, whom he found, he said, more  natural in their manners, and more agreeable than the self-sufficient  mechanics of villages and towns, who were ready to dispute on all  topics, and inclined to be convinced on none. This club had the  pleasure of subscribing for the first edition of the works of its  great associate. It has been questioned by his first biographer,  whether the refinement of mind, which follows the reading of books of  eloquence and delicacy,--the mental improvement resulting from such  calm discussions as the Tarbolton and Mauchline clubs indulged in, was  not injurious to men engaged in the barn and at the plough. A  well-ordered mind will be strengthened, as well as embellished, by  elegant knowledge, while over those naturally barren and ungenial all  that is refined or noble will pass as a sunny shower scuds over lumps  of granite, bringing neither warmth nor life.    In the account which the poet gives to Moore of his early poems, he  says little about his exquisite lyrics, and less about \"The Death and  dying Words of Poor Mailie,\" or her \"Elegy,\" the first of his poems  where the inspiration of the muse is visible; but he speaks with  exultation of the fame which those indecorous sallies, \"Holy Willie's  Prayer\" and \"The Holy Tulzie\" brought from some of the clergy, and the  people of Ayrshire. The west of Scotland is ever in the van, when  mutters either political or religious are agitated. Calvinism was  shaken, at this time, with a controversy among its professors, of  which it is enough to say, that while one party rigidly adhered to the  word and letter of the Confession of Faith, and preached up the palmy  and wholesome days of the Covenant, the other sought to soften the  harsher rules and observances of the kirk, and to bring moderation and  charity into its discipline as well as its councils. Both believed  themselves right, both were loud and hot, and personal,--bitter with a  bitterness only known in religious controversy. The poet sided with  the professors of the New Light, as the more tolerant were called, and  handled the professors of the Old Light, as the other party were  named, with the most unsparing severity. For this he had sufficient  cause:--he had experienced the mercilessness of kirk-discipline, when  his frailties caused him to visit the stool of repentance; and  moreover his friend Gavin Hamilton, a writer in Mauchline, had been  sharply censured by the same authorities, for daring to gallop on  Sundays. Moodie, of Riccarton, and Russel, of Kilmarnock, were the  first who tasted of the poet's wrath. They, though professors of the  Old Light, had quarrelled, and, it is added, fought: \"The Holy  Tulzie,\" which recorded, gave at the same time wings to the scandal;  while for \"Holy Willie,\" an elder of Mauchline, and an austere and  hollow pretender to righteousness, he reserved the fiercest of all his  lampoons. In \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\" he lays a burning hand on the  terrible doctrine of predestination: this is a satire, daring,  personal, and profane. Willie claims praise in the singular,  acknowledges folly in the plural, and makes heaven accountable for his  sins! in a similar strain of undevout satire, he congratulates Goudie,  of Kilmarnock, on his Essays on Revealed Religion. These poems,  particularly the two latter, are the sharpest lampoons in the  language.    While drudging in the cause of the New Light controversialists, Burns  was not unconsciously strengthening his hands for worthier toils: the  applause which selfish divines bestowed on his witty, but graceless  effusions, could not be enough for one who knew how fleeting the fame  was which came from the heat of party disputes; nor was he insensible  that songs of a beauty unknown for a century to national poesy, had  been unregarded in the hue and cry which arose on account of \"Holy  Willie's Prayer\" and \"The Holy Tulzie.\" He hesitated to drink longer  out of the agitated puddle of Calvinistic controversy, he resolved to  slake his thirst at the pure well-springs of patriot feeling and  domestic love; and accordingly, in the last and best of his  controversial compositions, he rose out of the lower regions of  lampoon into the upper air of true poetry. \"The Holy Fair,\" though  stained in one or two verses with personalities, exhibits a scene  glowing with character and incident and life: the aim of the poem is  not so much to satirize one or two Old Light divines, as to expose and  rebuke those almost indecent festivities, which in too many of the  western parishes accompanied the administration of the sacrament. In  the earlier days of the church, when men were staid and sincere, it  was, no doubt, an impressive sight to see rank succeeding rank, of the  old and the young, all calm and all devout, seated before the tent of  the preacher, in the sunny hours of June, listening to his eloquence,  or partaking of the mystic bread and wine; but in these our latter  days, when discipline is relaxed, along with the sedate and the pious  come swarms of the idle and the profligate, whom no eloquence can  edify and no solemn rite affect. On these, and such as these, the poet  has poured his satire; and since this desirable reprehension the Holy  Fairs, east as well as west, have become more decorous, if not more  devout.    His controversial sallies were accompanied, or followed, by a series  of poems which showed that national character and manners, as Lockhart  has truly and happily said, were once more in the hands of a national  poet. These compositions are both numerous and various: they record  the poet's own experience and emotions; they exhibit the highest moral  feeling, the purest patriotic sentiments, and a deep sympathy with the  fortunes, both here and hereafter of his fellow-men; they delineate  domestic manners, man's stern as well as social hours, and mingle the  serious with the joyous, the sarcastic with the solemn, the mournful  with the pathetic, the amiable with the gay, and all with an ease and  unaffected force and freedom known only to the genius of Shakspeare.  In \"The Twa Dogs\" he seeks to reconcile the labourer to his lot, and  intimates, by examples drawn from the hall as well as the cottage,  that happiness resides in the humblest abodes, and is even partial to  the clouted shoe. In \"Scotch Drink\" he excites man to love his  country, by precepts both heroic and social; and proves that while  wine and brandy are the tipple of slaves, whiskey and ale are the  drink of the free: sentiments of a similar kind distinguish his  \"Earnest Cry and Prayer to the Scotch Representatives in the House of  Commons,\" each of whom he exhorts by name to defend the remaining  liberties and immunities of his country. A higher tone distinguishes  the \"Address to the Deil:\" he records all the names, and some of them  are strange ones; and all the acts, and some of them are as whimsical  as they are terrible, of this far kenned and noted personage; to these  he adds some of the fiend's doings as they stand in Scripture,  together with his own experiences; and concludes by a hope, as  unexpected as merciful and relenting, that Satan may not be exposed to  "]]]
