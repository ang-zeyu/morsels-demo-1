Drew would have been content with Shiloh as a mount and a companion, but  now he was sure that the colt was more, so much more. This gray was going  to be one of the Great Ones, a racer and a sire--to leave his mark in horse  history and stamp his own quality on foals throughout miles and years in  this southwestern land. Drew licked the grit of dust from his lips, filled  his lungs with a deep breath as Shiloh turned under rein pressure.    It was a long time before the Kentuckian was able to separate Shiloh from  his ring of new admirers and bring him back to the stable. Drew refused  several offers for the colt, some of them so fantastic he could only  believe their makers sun-touched or completely carried away by the  excitement of the race.    But when he found _Don_ Cazar waiting for him at Kells', he guessed that  this was serious.    \"You do not wish to sell him, I suppose?\" Hunt Rennie smiled at Drew's  prompt shake of head. \"No, that would be too much to hope for, you are not  a fool. But I have something else to suggest. Reese Topham tells me you  are looking for work, preferably with horses. Well, I have a contract to  gentle some remounts for the army, and I need some experienced men to help  break them--\"    Drew could not understand the sudden pinch of--could it be alarm? Here it  was: a chance to work on the Range, to know Hunt Rennie, and learn whether  _Don_ Cazar was to remain a legend or become a father. But now he was not  sure.    \"I'm no breaker, suh. I've gentled, yes--but eastern style.\"    \"Breaking horses can be brutal, though we don't ride with red spurs on the  Range. Suppose we try some of the eastern methods and see how they work on  our wild ones. Do you think you can do it?\"    \"A man can't tell what he can do until he tries.\" Drew still hedged.    There was a trace of frown now between Rennie's brows. \"You told Topham  you wanted work.\" His tone implied that he found Drew's present hesitancy  odd. And--from _Don_ Cazar's point of view--it was. Tubacca was still in a  slump; the rest of the valley held about as many jobs for a man as Drew  had fingers on one hand. The Range was the big holding, and to ride there  meant security and an established position in the community. Also, perhaps  it was not an offer lightly made to an unknown newcomer.    \"I can't promise you blue-grass training, suh. That has to begin with a  foal.\" He hoped Rennie would credit his wavering to a modest appraisal of  his own qualifications.    \"Blue-grass training?\"    As his father repeated the expression Drew realized the slip of tongue he  had made. And if he took the job, there might be other slips, perhaps far  more serious ones. But to refuse, after Topham had spoken for him ... he  was caught in a pinch with cause for suspicion closing in on either side.    \"I was in Kentucky for about a year after the war. I went to stay with a  friend--\"    \"But you _are_ from Texas?\"    Was Rennie watching him too intently? No, he must ride a tighter rein on  his imagination. There was no reason in the wide world why _Don_ Cazar  should expect him to be anyone except Drew Kirby.    \"Yes, suh. Didn't have anythin' to go back to there. Thought I'd try for a  new start out here.\" There was the story of several thousand veterans.  Rennie should have heard it a good many times already.    \"Well, come and try some blue-grass training on our colts. And should you  let this stud of yours run with a picked _manada_ of mares, I could  promise good fees.\"    \"Suppose I said yes if the fees were some of the foals--of my own choosing,  suh?\" Drew asked.    Rennie ran a finger across the brand which scarred the gray's hide. \"Spur  R--that's a new one to me.\"    \"My own. Heard tell as how there's a custom of the country that a slick  this old can be branded and claimed by anyone bringing him in. I wasn't  going to lose him that way should he do any straying, accidental or  intentional.\"    _Don_ Cazar laughed. \"That's using your head, Kirby. All right. It's a  deal as far as I'm concerned. You draw wrangler's pay and take stud fees  in foals--say one in three, your choosing. Register that brand of yours  with _Don_ Lorenzo to be on the safe side. Then you're welcome to run Spur  R with the Double R on the Range.\"    He held out his hand, and Drew grasped it for a quick shake to seal their  agreement. He was committed now--to the Range and to a small partnership  with its master. But he still wondered if he had made the right choice.    Two days later he dropped bedroll and saddlebags on the spare bunk at one  end of the long adobe-walled room and studied his surroundings with deep  curiosity. It was a fort, all right, this whole stronghold of Rennie's--not  just the bunkhouse which formed part of a side wall. Bunkhouse, feed  store, and storage room, blacksmith shop, cookhouse, stables, main house,  the quarters for the married men and their families--all arranged to  enclose a patio into which choice stock could be herded at the time of an  attack, with a curbed well in the center.    The roofs of all the buildings were flat, with loopholed parapets to be  manned at need. A sentry post on the main house was occupied twenty-four  hours a day by relays of Pimas. A loaded rifle leaned at every window  opening, ready to be fired through loopholes in the wooden war shutters.  The walls were twenty-five inches thick, and mounted on the roof of the  stable, facing the hills from which Apache attacks usually came, was a  small brass cannon--_Don_ Cazar's legacy from troops marching away in '61.    What he saw of the resources of this private fort led Drew to accept the  other stories he had heard of the Range, like the one that _Don_ Cazar's  men practiced firing blindfolded at noise targets to be prepared for night  raids. The place was self-contained and almost self-supporting, with  stores of food, good water, its own forge and leather shop, its own  craftsmen and experts. No wonder the Apaches had given up trying to break  this Anglo outpost and Rennie had accomplished what others found  impossible. He had held his land secure against the worst and most  unbeatable enemy this country had nourished.    There were other Range forts, smaller, but as stoutly and ingeniously  designed, each built beside a water source on Rennie land--defense points  for _Don_ Cazar's riders, their garrisons rotated at monthly intervals.  And Drew had to thank that system for having taken Johnny Shannon away  from the Stronghold before the Kentuckian arrived. Rennie's foster son was  now riding inspection between one water-hole fortification and another.  But Drew was uncertain just how he would rub along with Shannon in the  future.    \"_Senor_ Kirby, _Don_ Cazar--he would speak with you in the Casa Grande,\"  Leon Rivas called through one of the patio side windows.    \"Coming.\" Drew left the huddle of his possessions on the bunk.    The Casa Grande of the Stronghold was a high-ceilinged, five-room building  about sixty feet long, the kitchen making a right angle to the other rooms  and joining the smoke house to form part of another wall for the patio.  Mesquite logs, adze-hewn and only partially smoothed, were placed over the  doorways, and the plank doors themselves were slung on hand-wrought iron  hinges or on leather straps, from oak turning-posts. Drew knocked on the  age-darkened surface of the big door.    \"Kirby? Come in.\"    Here in contrast to the brilliant sunlight of the patio was a dusky  coolness. There were no glass panes in the windows. Manta, the unbleached  muslin which served to cover such openings in the frontier ranches, was  tacked taut, allowing in air but only subdued light. The walls had been  smoothly plastered, and as in Topham's office, lengths of colorful woven  materials and a couple of Navajo blankets served as hangings. Rugs of  cougar and wolf skin were scattered on the beaten earth of the floor.  There was a tall carved cupboard with a grilled door, a bookcase, and two  massive chests shoved back against the walls. And over the stone mantel of  the fireplace hung a picture of a morose-looking, bearded man wearing a  steel breastplate, the canvas dim and dark with age and smoke.    _Don_ Cazar was seated at a table as massive as the chests, a pile of  papers before him flanked by two four-branch candelabra of native silver.  Bartolome Rivas' more substantial bulk weighed down the rawhide seat of  another chair more to one side.    \"Sit down--\" Rennie nodded to the seat in front of the table. \"Smoke?\" He  pushed forward a silver box holding the long cigarillos of the border  country. Drew shook his head.    \"Whisky? Wine?\" He gestured to a tray with waiting glasses.    \"Sherry.\" Drew automatically answered without thought.    \"What do you think of the stock you saw down in the corral?\" _Don_ Cazar  poured a honey-colored liquid from the decanter into a small glass.    As the Kentuckian raised it to sip, the scent of the wine quirked time for  him, making this for a fleeting moment the dining room at Red Springs  during a customary after-dinner gathering of the men of the household. The  talk there, too, had been of horses--always horses. Then Drew came back in  a twitch of eyelid to the here and now, to Hunt Rennie watching him with a  measuring he did not relish, to Bartolome's round face with its  close-to-hostile expression. Deliberately Drew sipped again before  answering the question.    \"I'd say, suh, if they're but a sample of Range stock, the breed is  excellent. However----\"    \"However what, _senor_?\" Bartolome's eyes challenged Drew. \"In this  territory, even in Sonora, there are none to compare with the horses of  this hacienda.\"    \"That is not what I was about to say, _Senor_ Rivas. But if _Don_ Cazar  wishes to try the eastern methods of training, these horses are too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#9)"],[1,"Gouging.]    In sharpening an outside bevel gouge, the main bevel is obtained on  the grindstone, care being taken to keep the gouge rocking on its  axis, so as to get an even curve. It is then whetted on the flat side  of a slipstone, Fig. 83, the bevel already obtained on the grindstone  being made slightly more obtuse at the edge. A good method is to rock  the gouge on its axis with the left hand, while the slipstone held in  the right hand is rubbed back and forth on the edge. Then the concave  side is rubbed on the round edge of the slipstone, care being taken to  avoid putting a bevel on it. Inside bevel gouges need to be ground on  a carborundum or other revolving stone having a round edge. The outfit  of the agacite grinder, (Fig. 224, p. 120), contains one of these  stones. The whetting, of course, is the reverse of that on the outside  bevel gouge.    [Illustration: Fig. 83. Whetting a Gouge.]    The _knife_ differs from the chisel in two respects, (1) the edge is  along the side instead of the end, and (2) it has a two-beveled edge.  Knives are sometimes made with one side flat for certain kinds of  paring work, but these are uncommon. The two-beveled edge is an  advantage to the worker in enabling him to cut into the wood at any  angle, but it is a disadvantage in that it is incapable of making flat  surfaces. The knife is particularly valuable in woodwork for scoring  and for certain emergencies. The sloyd knife, Fig. 84, is a tool  likely to be misused in the hands of small children, but when sharp  and in strong hands, has many valuable uses. A convenient size has a  2-1/2 inch blade. When grinding and whetting a knife, the fact that  both sides are beveled alike should be kept in mind.    [Illustration: Fig. 84. Sloyd Knife.]    [Illustration: Fig. 85. Draw-Knife.]    The _draw-knife_, Fig. 85, is ground like a chisel, with the bevel  only on one side, but the edge is along the side like a knife. Instead  of being pushed into the wood, like a chisel, it is drawn into it by  the handles which project in advance of the cutting edge. The handles  are sometimes made to fold over the edge, and thus protect it when not  in use. The size is indicated by the length of the cutting edge. It  is particularly useful in reducing narrow surfaces and in slicing off  large pieces, but it is liable to split rather than cut the wood.      SAWS.    [Illustration: Fig. 86. Hand Saw.]    The object of the saw is to cut thru a piece of material along a  determined line. Its efficiency depends upon (1) the narrowness of the  saw cut or \"kerf,\" and (2) upon the force required to drive it thru  the material. The thinner the blade, the less material will be cut out  and wasted, and the less force will have to be applied. In order to  have the saw as thin as possible, almost all the people of the world,  except the Anglo Saxons, have saws that cut when they are pulled  toward the worker. The blade is in tension while cutting and in  compression only when being returned for a new cut. German carpenters  use a saw like our turning-saw. English and Americans have developed  the saw on the opposite principle, namely, that it should cut on the  pushing stroke. As a matter of fact, the crosscut-saw cuts somewhat on  the back stroke. The pushing stroke necessitates a thickening of the  blade sufficient to prevent buckling,--a not uncommon occurrence  in the bands of a novice, in spite of this thickening. But tho  this requires more force, and involves more waste, there are the  compensations that the arm can exert more pressure in pushing than in  pulling, especially when the worker stands upright or stoops over his  work, and the stiffer wide blade acts as a guide to the sawyer. Each  method has its advantages. Whatever may be true of hand-saws, in  machine-saws the tension method, as illustrated by the gang-saw and  the band-saw, is steadily displacing the compression method utilized  in the circular-saw. Many kinds of work, however, can be done only on  the circular-saw.    In order to diminish the disadvantages of the thrusting stroke, the  modern hand-saw, Fig. 86, has been gradually improved as the result  of much experience and thought. The outline of the blade is tapered in  width from handle to point; it is thicker also at the heel (the handle  end) than at the point; its thickness also tapers from the teeth to  the back. All these tapers gives stiffness where it is most needed.  It is made wide for the sake of giving steadiness in sawing. The fact  that it is thinner at the back than along the teeth gives it clearance  in passing back and forth in the kerf, but the friction is still  great, especially in sawing soft or damp wood. To avoid this binding  still further, the teeth are \"set\" alternately one to one side and the  next to the other, and so on.    [Illustration: Fig. 87. Rip Saw Teeth: A-edge view, B-side view,  C cross-section. Crosscut-Saw Teeth: A'-edge view, B'-side view,  C'-cross-section.]    The size of saws is indicated by the length of the blade in inches.  The coarseness of the tooth is indicated by the number of \"points\"  to the inch. \"Points\" should not be confused with teeth as there is  always one more point per inch than there are teeth. For example,  a five point rip-saw has five points to the inch but only four  full teeth, Fig. 87. Rip-saws run from 4 to 7 points per inch;  crosscut-saws from 6 to 12 points per inch.    In general, saws are of two kinds, rip-saws and crosscut-saws.    The _rip-saw_, Fig. 87, may be thought of as a series of chisels set  in two parallel rows which overlap each other, for each tooth is filed  to a sharp edge which, at each stroke, chisels off a small particle  from the end of the wood fibers.    The shape of the teeth is the result of experience in uniting a number  of factors: as, strength of the individual tooth, the acuteness of  the cutting angle, and the ease of sharpening. The steel of a saw is  softer than that of a chisel, in order that it may be filed and set.  Hence it is weaker and the edge cannot be so acute. A typical form  of tooth is shown in Fig. 87, in which A is an edge view, B the side  view, and C a cross section. The angle of each tooth covers 60 deg., one  side, the \"face\", being at right angles to the line of the teeth. The  cutting edge runs at right angles to the sides of the blade.    This arrangement works with entire success along the grain, but if a  rip-saw is used to cut across the grain, since there is no provision  for cutting thru the fibers, each tooth catches in them and tears them  out, thus leaving a rough and jagged surface.    In the _crosscut-saw_, therefore, the teeth are filed to points, and  the cutting edge is on the forward side of each alternate tooth.  In Fig. 87. A' is the edge view, B' is the side view and C' is a  cross-section. In a properly filed crosscut-saw a needle will slide  between these two rows of teeth from one end of the saw to the other.    [Illustration: Fig. 88. Rip-Sawing on a Horse.]    In action the points, especially their forward edges, cut or score the  fibres of wood, and then the triangular elevation of wood left between  the two rows of points is crumbled off by friction as the saw  passes through. Thus it drops farther and farther into the cut. A  crosscut-saw may be thought of as a series of knife points, arranged  in two parallel rows. Ordinarily the angle of the \"face\" of each tooth  with the line of the teeth is about 65 deg., and slightly steeper than the  back of the tooth. The angle of the cutting edge of each tooth may be  filed more acute when the saw is to be used for soft wood only.    A crosscut-saw when used to rip a board, works slowly, for there is no  chisel action to cut out the fibres between the points, but the cut,  tho slow, is smooth. In cutting diagonally across a piece of wood,  especially soft wood, a rip-saw cuts faster, but a crosscut, smoother.  In ripping a board, allowance should always be made for planing to the  line afterward. In starting a cut with the rip-saw, the weight of the  saw should be borne by the right hand so that the teeth may pass over  the edge of the wood as lightly as possible. The left thumb acts as  a guide. If the saw be handled thus, and the angle with the board be  quite acute, it is not necessary to start with a back stroke. When the  kerf is well started, the whole weight of the saw may be applied. An  easy light stroke is better than a furious one. The line should  be followed carefully, but if the saw runs from the line it may be  brought back by taking short strokes near the point of the saw and  twisting the blade slightly in the desired direction. If the saw binds  and buckles because of the springing together of the wood, the kerf  may be wedged open with a screwdriver or a bit of waste wood. A drop  of oil rubbed across each side of the saw will make it work more  easily.    Care should be taken in finishing a cut to hold up firmly the part  of the wood which is being sawn off so that it will not split off or  splinter.    [Illustration: Fig. 89. Rip-sawing with Wood Held in Bench-Vise.]    Sawing may be done either on a saw-horse, Fig. 88, or at a bench. For  big, rough work, the former is the common way, the worker holding the  material in place with one knee, because this method enables him to  exert his greatest strength. A convenient way for rip-sawing a small  piece of wood is to insert it in the vise, Fig. 89, with the broad  side of the board parallel to the vise screw, and the board inclined  away from the worker who stands upright. The start is easy, the  sawdust does not cover the line, and the board is not in danger of  splitting. The board, however, has to be reversed after it is sawn  part way thru, in order to finish the saw cut.    The _back-saw_ or _tenon-saw_, Fig. 90, is a fine crosscut-saw, with  a rib of steel along the back, which gives to it its name. Since it is  intended for small accurate work,"]]]
