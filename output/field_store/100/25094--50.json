Those days are happily over, and there is now little use for  the Egyptian forts which to the south and east guarded the little  frontier town.    From a ruined Roman fort which crowns a low hill at the south end of  the town we have our first view of the cataract, and the sudden change  in the character of the scenery is remarkable.    In place of the broad fields and mountains to which we have been  accustomed, the river here flows in a basin formed by low, precipitous  hills, and is broken by innumerable rocky islets on different levels,  which form the series of rapids and little cascades which give the  cataract its name. These little islets are formed by a collection of  boulders of red granite filled in with silt, and have a very strange  effect, for the boulders are rounded by the action of the water,  which, combined with the effect of the hot sun, has caused the red  stone to become coated with a hard skin, black and smooth to touch,  just as though they had been blackleaded.    Many of the islets are simply rocks of curious shapes which jut out of  the water; others are large enough to be partially cultivated, and  their little patches of green are peculiarly vivid in contrast with  the rock and sand which form their setting.    The scenery is wildly fantastic, for while the rocks which form the  western bank are almost entirely covered by the golden sand-drifts  which pour over them, smooth as satin, to the water's edge, those on  the east are sun-baked and forbidding, a huge agglomeration of  boulders piled one upon the other and partially covered by shingle,  which crackle under foot like clinkers; between are the islands, many  crowned by a hut or pigeon-cote, and with their greenery often  perfectly reflected in the rapidly flowing water.    Though navigation here is difficult, and a strong breeze is necessary  to enable vessels to ascend the river, boat sailing is a popular  feature of European life in Assuan, a special kind of sailing-boat  being kept for visitors, who organize regattas and enjoy many a  pleasant picnic beneath the shade of the dom palms or mimosa-trees  which grow among the rocks.    In the old days the great excursion from Assuan was by water to the  \"Great Gate,\" as the principal rapid was called, often a difficult  matter to accomplish. To-day the great dam has replaced it as the  object of a sail.    This is the greatest engineering work of the kind ever constructed,  and spans the Nile Valley at the head of the cataract basin. It is a  mile and a quarter in length, and the river, which is raised in level  about 66 feet, pours through a great number of sluice-gates which are  opened or shut according to the season of the year and the necessities  of irrigation or navigation.    Behind, the steep valley is filled, and forms a huge lake extending  eighty miles to the south, and many pretty villages have been  submerged, while of the date-groves which surrounded them the crests  of the higher trees alone appear above water. The green island of  Philae also is engulfed, and of the beautiful temple of Isis built upon  it only the upper portion is visible.    Below the dam activity of many kinds characterizes the Nile, as does  the sound of rushing water the Cataract basin. Above, silence reigns,  for the huge volume of stored water lies inert between its rugged  banks.    One's first thought is one of sadness, for everywhere the tree-tops,  often barely showing above water, seem to mourn the little villages  and graveyards which lie below, and as yet no fresh verdure has  appeared to give the banks the life and beauty they formerly had.    As at the cataract, here also the hills are simply jumbled heaps of  granite boulders, fantastically piled one upon the other, barren and  naked, and without any vegetable growth to soften their forbidding  wildness.    On many rocky islands are the ruined mud buildings of the Romans, and  more than one village, once populous, lies deserted and abandoned upon  some promontory which is now surrounded by the flood.    Though a general sense of mournfulness pervades it, the scenery has  much variety and beauty, nor have all the villages been destroyed;  many had already been built far above the present water-level, while  others have sprung up to take the place of those submerged. These  again present new features to the traveller, for, unlike many we have  seen below the cataract, these Nubian dwellings are well built, the  mud walls being neatly smoothed and often painted. The roofs are  peculiar, being in the form of well-constructed semicircular arches,  all of mud, and in many cases the tops of the outside walls are  adorned by a kind of balustrade of open brickwork.    Half hidden among the rocks the native house has often the appearance  of some temple pylon, and seems to fit the landscape in a peculiar  way, for no form of building harmonizes so well with the Egyptian  scenery as the temple. Whether or not the native unconsciously copies  the ancient structure I cannot say, but anyone visiting Egypt must  often be struck by the resemblance, particularly when, as is often the  case, the little house is surmounted by pigeon-cotes, which in form  are so like the temple towers.    Like their homes, the inhabitants of Nubia also differ from those of  Egypt proper, for they are Berbers and more of the Arab type,  handsome, and with regular features and ruddy in complexion, while  many of the small children, who, excepting for a few strings of beads,  run about naked, are extremely beautiful. There is one curious fact  about these villages which no one could fail to notice, for while  there are always plenty of women and children to be seen, there are no  _men_, and though practically there is no cultivation, food appears to  be abundant!    The reason is that these people are so nice in character and generally  so trustworthy, that the men are all employed in Cairo and elsewhere  as domestic servants, or \"syces,\"[6] and though they themselves may  not see their homes for years, their wages are good, and so they are  able to send food and clothing in plenty to their families.    [Footnote 6: Grooms.]    As we ascend the river and approach the limit of the stored water, the  banks again become fertile, for here the water is simply maintained at  flood-level, and has not had the same disastrous effect as lower down  the valley. Here the scenery is very striking; bold rocks jut out from  the beautiful golden sand-drifts which often pour into the river  itself, or in sharp contrast terminate in the brilliant line of green  which fringes the banks. All around, their ruggedness softened in the  warm light, are the curious, conical mountains of Nubia, and on the  eastern side large groves of palms, green fields, and water-wheels  make up as pretty a scene as any in Egypt; presently, no doubt,  cultivation will again appear on the barren margins of the lake above  the dam and restore to it the touch of beauty it formerly had.    It is intended still further to raise the dam, and the higher level of  water then maintained will not only entirely submerge Philae, but  practically all the villages now existing on its banks, as well as  partially inundating many interesting temples of Roman origin. It  seems a pity that so beautiful a temple as Philae should be lost, and  one feels sorry that the villages and palm-groves of Nubia should be  destroyed, but necessity knows no law, and each year water is required  in greater quantities, as the area of cultivation below extends, while  the villagers are amply compensated by the Government for their loss.    It is interesting to stand upon the dam and see the pent-up water pour  through the sluices to form huge domes of hissing water which toss  their sprays high into the air, and whose roar may be heard many miles  away, while on the rocky islands down-stream numbers of natives are  watching the rushing stream, ready to dive in and secure the numbers  of fish of various sizes which are drawn through the sluice-gates and  are stunned or killed under the great pressure of water.    There are many other interests in Assuan, which is a delightful place  to visit. The desert rides, the ancient quarries where the temple  obelisks were hewn, the camp of the beautiful Besharin, and the  weirdly pictorial Cufic cemetery which winds so far along the barren  valley in which the river once flowed--each have their attraction,  which varies with the changing light, while many a happy hour may be  spent in watching the many coloured lizards which play among the  rocks, the curious mantis and twig-insects, and other strange  specimens of insect life which abound here; while, should you weary of  sight-seeing and the glare of light, quietude and repose may be found  among the fruit-laden fig-trees of Kitchener's Island, or in the shady  gardens of Elephantine.    Such in brief is the Nile from Cairo to the first cataract, though a  great deal more might be written on this subject. The various towns  and villages passed are often very pretty, and some are of great age,  and surrounded by very interesting remains. Then there is the  enjoyment of the many excursions on donkey-back to visit some tomb or  temple, the amusement of bargaining for trophies or curios at the  various landing-places, and a host of other interests which go to make  the trip up the Nile one of the most fascinating possible, and which  prevent any weariness of mind in the passenger. But to write fully  about all these things is beyond the scope of this small book, though  some day, perhaps, many of my readers may have the opportunity of  seeing it all for themselves, and so fill in the spaces my short  narrative must necessarily leave.          CHAPTER VIII    THE MONUMENTS      If asked to name any one thing which more than any other typified  Egypt, the average boy or girl would at once reply, \"The pyramids,\"  and rightly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#9)"],[1,"the ladies of the palace. These women saw in  Chow-sin's latest wife the most beautiful woman who had ever lived in  the royal harem. One would think that this beauty might have caused  them to hate Fox Sprite, but such was not the case. They admired the  plumpness of Fox Sprite's body, the fairness of Fox Sprite's complexion,  the fire in Fox Sprite's eyes, but most of all they wondered at the  smallness of Fox Sprite's feet, for, you remember, the supposed Ta-ki  now had fox's feet instead of those of human shape.    Thus small feet became the fashion among women. All the court ladies,  old and young, beautiful and ugly, began thinking of plans for making  their own feet as tiny as those of Fox Sprite. In this way they thought  to increase their chances of finding favour with the Emperor.    Gradually people outside the palace began to hear of this absurd  fashion. Mothers bound the feet of their little girls, in such a manner  as to stop their growth. The bones of the toes were bent backwards and  broken, so eager were the elders to have their daughters grow up into  tiny-footed maidens. Thus, for several years of their girlhood the  little ones were compelled to endure the most severe tortures. It was  not long before the new fashion took firm root in China. It became  almost impossible for parents to get husbands for their daughters unless  the girls had suffered the severe pains of foot-binding. And even to  this day we find that many of the people are still under the influence  of Fox Sprite's magic, and believe that a tiny, misshapen foot is more  beautiful than a natural one.    But let us return to the story of Fox Sprite and the wicked Emperor. For  a number of years matters grew continually worse in the country. At last  the people rose in a body against the ruler. A great battle was fought.  The wicked Chow-sin was overthrown and put to death by means of those  very instruments of torture he had used so often against his subjects.  By this time it had become known to all the lords and noblemen that the  Emperor's favourite had been the main cause of their ruler's wickedness;  hence they demanded the death of Fox Sprite. But no one wished to kill  so lovely a creature. Every one appointed refused to do the deed.    Finally, a grey-headed member of the court allowed himself to be  blindfolded. With a sharp sword he pierced the body of Fox Sprite to the  heart. Those standing near covered their eyes with their hands, for they  could not bear to see so wonderful a woman die. Suddenly, as they looked  up, they saw a sight so strange that all were filled with amazement.  Instead of falling to the ground, the graceful form swayed backward and  forward for a moment, when all at once there seemed to spring from her  side a huge mountain fox. The animal glanced around him, then, with a  cry of fear, dashing past officials, courtiers and soldiers, he rushed  through the gate of the enclosure.    \"A fox!\" cried the people, full of wonder.    At that moment Ta-ki fell in a swoon upon the floor. When they picked  her up, thinking, of course, that she had died from the sword thrust,  they could find no blood on her body, and, on looking more closely, they  saw that there was not even the slightest wound.    \"Marvel of marvels!\" they all shouted. \"The gods have shielded her!\"    Just then Ta-ki opened her eyes and looked about her. \"Where am I?\" she  asked, in faint voice. \"Pray tell me what has happened.\"    Then they told her what they had seen, and at last it was plain to the  beautiful woman that, after all these years, Fox Sprite had left her  body. She was herself once more. For a long time she could not make the  people believe her story; they all said that she must have lost her  mind; that the gods had saved her life, but had punished her for her  wickedness by taking away her reason.    But that night, when her maids were undressing her in the palace, they  saw her feet, which had once more become their natural size, and then  they knew she had been telling the truth.    How Ta-ki became the wife of a good nobleman who had long admired her  great beauty is much too long a story to be told here. Of one thing,  however, we are certain, that she lived long and was happy ever  afterwards.          THE TALKING FISH    [Illustration]      Long, long before your great-grandfather was born there lived in the  village of Everlasting Happiness two men called Li and Sing. Now, these  two men were close friends, living together in the same house. Before  settling down in the village of Everlasting Happiness they had ruled as  high officials for more than twenty years. They had often treated the  people very harshly, so that everybody, old and young, disliked and  hated them. And yet, by robbing the wealthy merchants and by cheating  the poor, these two evil companions had become rich, and it was in order  to spend their ill-gotten gains in idle amusements that they sought out  the village of Everlasting Happiness. \"For here,\" said they, \"we can  surely find that joy which has been denied us in every other place. Here  we shall no longer be scorned by men and reviled by women.\"    Consequently these two men bought for themselves the finest house in  the village, furnished it in the most elegant manner, and decorated  the walls with scrolls filled with wise sayings and pictures by famous  artists. Outside there were lovely gardens filled with flowers and  birds, and oh, ever so many trees with queer twisted branches growing  in the shape of tigers and other wild animals.    Whenever they felt lonely Li and Sing invited rich people of the  neighbourhood to come and dine with them, and after they had eaten,  sometimes they would go out upon the little lake in the centre of their  estate, rowing in an awkward flat-bottomed boat that had been built by  the village carpenter.    One day, on such an occasion, when the sun had been beating down  fiercely upon the clean-shaven heads of all those on the little barge,  for you must know this was long before the day when hats were worn--at  least, in the village of Everlasting Happiness--Mr. Li was suddenly  seized with a giddy feeling, which rapidly grew worse and worse until  he was in a burning fever.    \"Snake's blood mixed with powdered deer-horn is the thing for him,\"  said the wise-looking doctor who was called in, peering at Li carefully  through his huge glasses, \"Be sure,\" he continued, addressing Li's  personal attendant, and, at the same time, snapping his long  finger-nails nervously, \"be sure, above all, not to leave him alone, for  he is in danger of going raving mad at any moment, and I cannot say what  he may do if he is not looked after carefully. A man in his condition  has no more sense than a baby.\"    Now, although these words of the doctor's really made Mr. Li angry, he  was too ill to reply, for all this time his head had been growing hotter  and hotter, until at last a feverish sleep overtook him. No sooner had  he closed his eyes than his faithful servant, half-famished, rushed out  of the room to join his fellows at their mid-day meal.    Li awoke with a start. He had slept only ten minutes. \"Water, water,\"  he moaned, \"bathe my head with cold water. I am half dead with pain!\"  But there was no reply, for the attendant was dining happily with his  fellows.    \"Air, air,\" groaned Mr. Li, tugging at the collar of his silk shirt.  \"I'm dying for water. I'm starving for air. This blazing heat will kill  me. It is hotter than the Fire god himself ever dreamed of making it.  Wang, Wang!\" clapping his hands feebly and calling to his servant,  \"air and water, air and water!\"    But still no Wang.    At last, with the strength that is said to come from despair, Mr. Li  arose from his couch and staggered toward the doorway. Out he went into  the paved courtyard, and then, after only a moment's hesitation, made  his way across it into a narrow passage that led into the lake garden.    \"What do they care for a man when he is sick?\" he muttered. \"My good  friend Sing is doubtless even now enjoying his afternoon nap, with a  servant standing by to fan him, and a block of ice near his head to cool  the air. What does he care if I die of a raging fever? Doubtless he  expects to inherit all my money. And my servants! That rascal Wang has  been with me these ten years, living on me and growing lazier every  season! What does he care if I pass away? Doubtless he is certain that  Sing's servants will think of something for him to do, and he will have  even less work than he has now. Water, water! I shall die if I don't  soon find a place to soak myself!\"    So saying, he arrived at the bank of a little brook that flowed in  through a water gate at one side of the garden and emptied itself into  the big fish-pond. Flinging himself down by a little stream Li bathed  his hands and wrists in the cool water. How delightful! If only it were  deep enough to cover his whole body, how gladly would he cast himself in  and enjoy the bliss of its refreshing embrace!    For a long time he lay on the ground, rejoicing at his escape from the  doctor's clutches. Then, as the fever began to rise again, he sprang up  with a determined cry, \"What am I waiting for? I will do it. There's no  one to prevent me, and it will do me a world of good. I will cast myself  head first into the fish-pond. It is not deep enough near the shore to  drown me if I should be too weak to swim, and I am sure it will restore  me to strength and health.\"    He hastened along the little stream, almost running in his eagerness to  reach the deeper water of the pond. He was like some small Tom Brown who  had escaped from the watchful eye of the master and run out to play in a  forbidden spot.    Hark! Was that a servant calling? Had Wang discovered the absence of his  employer? Would he sound the alarm, and would the whole place soon be  alive with men searching for the fever-stricken patient?    With one"]]]
