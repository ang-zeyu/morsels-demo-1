O friends of Abdul-Baha and his co-sharers and partners in the servitude  of the Lord of Hosts! Verily, the greatest affair and the most important  matter today is to establish a Masharak-el-Azcar(17) and to found a Temple  from which the voice of praisings may rise to the Kingdom of the majestic  Lord. Blessings be upon you for having thought to do so and intending to  erect such an edifice, advancing all in devoting your wealth in this great  purpose and in this splendid work. You will soon see the angels of  confirmation following after you and the hosts of reinforcement crowding  before you.    When the Mashrak-el-Azcar is accomplished, when the lights are emanating  therefrom, the righteous ones are presenting themselves therein, the  prayers are performed with supplication towards the mysterious Kingdom (of  heaven), the voice of glorification is raised to the Lord, the Supreme,  then the believers shall rejoice, the hearts shall be dilated and overflow  with the love of the All-living and Self-existent (God). The people shall  hasten to worship in that heavenly Temple, the fragrances of God will be  elevated, the divine teachings will be established in the hearts like the  establishment of the Spirit in mankind; the people will then stand firm in  the Cause of your Lord, the Merciful. Praise and greetings be upon you.          \"O ye who are chosen! O ye who are firm! O ye who...\"      O ye who are chosen! O ye who are firm! O ye who are calling! O ye who are  sincere!    Verily I praise my Supreme Lord for choosing you to call in His Name among  the people, for attracting you to the beauty of El-Abha and for  strengthening you in rendering His Cause victorious.    I trust in Him to make your faces shine forth with glorious lights in that  clime, glistening as the face of heaven by the light of the early dawn,  unto the horizons.    Verily I herald unto you the confirmations which will sustain you by the  mercy of your Lord. For ye have arisen with all your power to serve God's  Cause in that vast region. Ponder over this great bounty and manifest  attainment!    I send you the glad-tidings of the erection of the Temple of worship  (Mashrak-el-Azcar) in Ishkabad [Russia], with all joy and great happiness.  The friends of God assembled together with rejoicing and conveyed the  stones themselves, upon their backs, while attracted by the love of God  and for the glory of God. Soon that great Temple will be completed and the  voice of prayer and praise shall ascend to the sublime Kingdom.    I was rejoiced through your endeavors in this glorious cause, made with  joy and good interest. I pray God to aid you in exalting His Word and in  establishing the Temple of Worship, through His grace and ancient mercy.  Verily you are the first to arise for this glorious cause in that vast  region. Soon will ye see the spread of this enterprise in the world and  its resounding voice shall go through the ears of the people in all parts.    Exert your energy in accomplishing what you have undertaken, so that this  glorious Temple may be built, that the beloved of God may assemble therein  and that they may pray and offer glory to God for guiding them to His  Kingdom.    Convey my greeting and praise to the beloved of God in that city.          \"Your three reports, together with the public...\"      (18) Your three reports, together with the public announcement(19), were  received. Praise be to God! all the contents indicated firmness,  spirituality and goodness. The friends of the Spiritual Meeting are indeed  manifesting efforts in the Cause of God. Soon the unseen strength of  heaven will become evident, and such zeal and earnestness will become  manifest in that country that it will affect all parts of the world.    Souls are like unto mirrors, and the bounty of God is like unto the sun.  When the mirrors pass beyond all coloring and attain purity and polish,  and are confronted with the sun, they will reflect in full perfection its  light and glory. In this condition one should not consider the mirror, but  the power of the light of the sun, which hath penetrated the mirror,  making it a reflector of the heavenly glory.    I hope that the House of Spirituality will become a heavenly mirror and  the lights of the Sun of Truth will so penetrate it that all parts will be  illuminated through it.    Your public announcement was carefully considered, and in some places  slight corrections were made, and it was returned to you. This  announcement should be given forth with wisdom, and not in haste, for it  would be a cause of stirring up. When ye find a soul manifesting a demand  for Truth, then ye may give this to him, that he may be informed of the  rudiments of the Cause.    But my name should be confined to Abdul-Baha in all writings. This is the  collective name which will gather all the people, and it is the strong  fortress and protection of the Cause of God. The beloved ones must limit  themselves to this. However, ye may mention me as the Light of the Love of  God, the Flame of the Guidance of God and the Banner of Peace and Harmony.  I trust in God that ye may ever be confirmed through the Holy Spirit.          \"O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!...\"      O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!    Your long letter was considered and its contents were a source of  happiness. Thank God that ye, western friends, have become dawning-points  of the love of God and stars of knowledge leading to Him; night and day  are ye thinking of imparting life to souls and of educating people of  discernment.    Regarding the blessed word, the Greatest Name: Its writing or spelling is  according to its pronunciation (i.e., it is spelled as it is pronounced)  in the Persian language. Baha is correct; Beha is incorrect. However this  question must not cause inharmony and grief among the friends. This truth  shall become manifest.    Should ye attribute a mistake to a person, it will be a cause of offense  and grief to him--how much greater would this be if it is attributed to a  number of people! How often it hath occurred that a slight difference hath  caused a great dissension and hath been made a reason for division. Now,  you write Baha'u'llah,(20) but do not object to any person. All will  eventually follow the correct spelling.    O ye beloved ones of God! The manifestation of the Light of Unity is for  binding together the people of the world. If this unity is not attained,  the tree of life is made fruitless, the heavenly bounty is not utilized.  The blessed blood (of the saints) was shed for bringing about unity and  harmony. These souls gave their lives as sacrifice in order to produce the  love that bindeth the hearts of all the people. Therefore, ye should all  spend your efforts in uniting and reconciling (the people), so that the  light of God's love may permeate the universe.    The Spiritual Meeting of men (House of Spirituality) and the Spiritual  Meeting of women (Assembly of Teaching) in Chicago are indeed endeavoring  to serve. If they unite, as they should, they will produce great results.  Especially, if the Spiritual Meetings of Chicago unite with those of New  York and become bound together, in a short while the fragrance of the  divine garden, which giveth life, will perfume all regions.          \"O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!...\"      O ye spiritual friends of Abdul-Baha!    Your letter was considered; its contents were a source of satisfaction to  the heart and its meaning indicative of firmness and steadfastness in the  Cause of God.    That gathering is under the shelter and protection of the mighty Lord. I  hope that, as it should be, ye may be confirmed by the fragrance of the  Holy Spirit and day by day may grow in love for God and attraction to the  eternal beauty of the Sun of the horizons.    The spiritual love of God maketh man pure and holy and clotheth him with  the garment of virtue and purity. And when man attacheth his heart wholly  to God and becometh related to the Blessed Perfection, the divine bounty  will dawn. This love is not physical, nay, rather, it is absolutely  spiritual.    The souls whose consciences are enlightened through the light of the love  of God, they are like unto shining lights and resemble stars of holiness  in the heaven of purity.    The real and great love is the love of God. That is holy above the  imaginations and thoughts of men.    The beloved of God must each be the essence of purity and holiness; so may  they be known by their purity, freedom and meekness in every land; they  may drink from the eternal chalice of the love of God, enjoy its ecstasy,  and through meeting the Beauty of Abha, they should be joyful, active,  aglow with zeal and wonderful. This is the station of the sincere. This is  the quality of those who are firm. This is the illumination of the faces  of those who are near.    Therefore, O ye friends of God, ye must in perfect purity attain spiritual  unity and agreement to a degree that ye may express one spirit and one  life.    In this condition physical bodies play no part: the command and authority  are in the hand of the spirit. When the spirit becometh all inclusive, the  Spiritual union shall be attained. Night and day endeavor to attain  perfect harmony; be thoughtful concerning your own spiritual developments  and close your eyes to the shortcomings of one another.    By good deeds, pure lives, humility and meekness be a lesson for others.    Abdul-Baha wisheth no one's heart to feel hurt, nor will he be a source of  grief to any one; for there is no greater satisfaction than being a source  of joy to the hearts.    I ask God that ye may become like angels of heaven, sources of happiness  to souls.          \"O ye dear friends of Abdul-Baha!...\"      O ye dear friends of Abdul-Baha!

No detail thought out, much less worked out or practised, as to  form or manner of landing;    (2). Absence of 29th Division;    (3). Lack of gear (naval and military) for any landing on a large scale  or maintenance thereafter;    (4). Unsettled weather; my ground is not solid enough to support me  were I to put it to K. that I had broken away from his explicit  instructions.    The Navy, i.e., de Robeck, Wemyss and Keyes, entirely agree. They see as  well as we do that the military force ought to have been ready before  the Navy began to attack. What we have to do now is to repair a first  false step. The Admiral undertakes to keep pegging away at the Straits  whilst we in Alexandria are putting on our war paint. He will see to it,  he says, that they think more of battleships than of landings. He is  greatly relieved to hear _I_ have practically made up my mind to go for  the South of the Peninsula and to keep in closest touch with the Fleet.  The Commodore also seems well pleased: he told us he hoped to get his  Fleet Sweeps so reorganised as to do away with the danger from mines by  the 3rd or 4th of April; then, he says, with us to do the spotting for  the naval guns, the battleships can smother the Forts and will alarm the  Turkish Infantry as to that tenderest part of an Army--its rear. So I  may say that all are in full agreement,--a blessing.    Have cabled home begging for more engineers, a lot of hand grenades,  trench mortars, periscopes and tools. The barbed wire bothers me! Am  specially keen about trench mortars; if it comes to close fighting on  the Peninsula with its restricted area trench mortars may make up for  our lack of artillery and especially of howitzers. Luckily, they can be  turned out quickly.    _23rd March, 1915. H.M.S. \"Franconia.\"_ At 9 a.m. General d'Amade and  his Staff came aboard. D'Amade had been kept yesterday by his own  pressing business from attending the Conference. I have read him these  notes and have shown him my cable of yesterday to Lord K. in which I say  that \"The French Commander is equally convinced that a move to  Alexandria is a practical necessity, although a point of honour makes it  impossible for him to suggest turning his back to the Turks to his own  Government.\" But, I say, \"he will be enchanted if they give him the  order.\" D'Amade says I have not quite correctly represented his views.  Not fantastic honour, he says, caused him to say we had better, for a  while, hold on, but rather the sense of prestige. He thought the  departure of the troops following so closely on the heels of the naval  repulse would have a bad moral effect on the Balkans. But he agrees  that, in practice, the move has now become imperative; the animals are  dying; the men are overcrowded, whilst Mudros is impossible as a base.  My cable, therefore, may stand.    At 10 o'clock he, Birdie and myself landed to inspect a Battalion of  Australians (9th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade). I made them carry out a  little attack on a row of windmills, and really, they did not show much  more imagination over the business than did Don Quixote in a similar  encounter. But the men are superb specimens.    Some of the troop transports left harbour for Egypt during the  afternoon. Bad to see these transports sailing the wrong way. What a  d----d pity! is what every soldier here feels--and says. But to look  on the bright side, our fellows will be twice as well trained to boat  work, and twice as well equipped by the time the 29th turn up, and by  then the weather will be more settled. As d'Amade said too, it will be  worth a great deal to us if the French troops get a chance of working a  little over the ground together with their British comrades before they  go shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy. All the same, if I had  my men and guns handy, I'd rather get at the Turks quick than be sure of  good weather and good _band-o-bast_ and be sure also of a well-prepared  enemy.    In the afternoon Braithwaite brought me a draft cable for Lord K. _re_  yesterday's Conference. I have approved. In it I say, \"on the  thoroughness with which I can make the preliminary arrangements, of  which the proper allocation of troops, etc., to transports is not the  least important, the success of my plans will largely depend.\"  Therefore, I am going to Alexandria, as a convenient place for this work  and, \"the Turks will be kept busy meanwhile by the Admiral.\"    _24th March, 1915. H.M.S. \"Franconia.\"_ D'Amade and Staff came aboard at  10 a.m. He has got leave to move and will sail to Alexandria forthwith.  Roger Keyes from the Flagship came shortly afterward. He is sick as a  she-bear robbed of her cubs that his pets: battleships, T.B.s,  destroyers, submarines, etc., should have to wait for the Army. Well, we  are not to blame! Keyes has been shown my cables to K. and is pleased  with them. He accepts the fact, I think, that the Army must tackle the  mobile artillery of the Turks before the Navy can expect to silence the  light guns protecting the mine fields and then clear out the mines with  the present type of mine sweeper. But the Admiral's going to fix up the  mine sweeper question while we are away. Once he has done that, Keyes  believes the Fleet can knock out the Forts; wipe out the protective  batteries and sweep up the mines quite comfortably. He said one  illuminating and encouraging thing to Braithwaite; viz., that he had  never felt so possessed of the power of the Navy to force a passage  through the Narrows as in the small hours of the 19th when he got back  to the Flagship after trying in vain to salve the _Ocean_ and the  _Irresistible_.    Keyes brought me a first class letter from the Admiral--very much to the  point:--                                                    \"H.M.S. _Q.E._                                                       _24th March, 15._      \"My Dear General,    \"I hear the Authorities at 'Home' have been sending hastening telegrams  to you. They most unfortunately did the same to us and probably if our  work had been slower and more thorough it would have been better. If  only they were on the _spot_, they would realise that to hurry would  write failure. In my very humble opinion, good co-operation and  organisation means everything for the future. A great triumph is much  better than scraping through and poor results! We are entirely with you  and can be relied on to give any assistance in our power. We will not be  idle!                                 \"Believe me,                                   \"Yours sincerely,                                      (_Sd._) \"J.M. de Robeck.\"    11-15. Admiral Thursby (just arrived with the _Queen_ and _Implacable_)  came to make his salaams. We served together at Malta and both broke  sinews in our calves playing lawn tennis--a bond of union.    Have cabled to Lord K. telling him I am just off to Alexandria. Have  said that the ruling factor of my date of landing must be the arrival of  the 29th Division \"(see para. 2 of your formal instructions to me the  foresight of which appeals to me with double force now we are at close  quarters with the problem[7]).\" I have pointed out that Birdwood's  Australians are very weak in artillery; that the Naval Division has none  at all and that the guns of the 29th Division make that body even more  indispensable than he had probably realised. I would very much like to  add that these are no times for infantry divisions minus artillery  seeing that they ought to have three times the pre-war complement of  guns, but Braithwaite's good advice has prevailed. As promised at the  Conference I express a hope that I may be allowed \"to complete  Birdwood's New Zealand Division with a Brigade of Gurkhas who would work  admirably in the terrain\" of the Peninsula. In view of what we have  gathered from Keyes, I wind up by saying, \"The Admiral, whose confidence  in the Navy seems to have been raised even higher by recent events, and  who is a thruster if ever there was one, is in agreement with this  telegram.\"    Actually Keyes will show him a copy; we will wait one hour before  sending it off and, if we don't hear then, we may take it de Robeck will  have endorsed the purport. Of course, if he does not agree the last  sentence must come out, and he will have to put his own points to the  Admiralty.    _Later_.--Have sent Doughty Wylie to Athens to do \"Intelligence\": the  cable was approved by Navy; duly despatched; and now--up anchor!          CHAPTER III    EGYPT      _25th March, 1915. H.M.S. \"Franconia.\" At Sea._ A fine smooth sea and a  flowing tide. Have written to K. and Mr. Asquith. Number two has caused  me _fikr_.[8] The P.M. lives in another plane from us soldiers. So it  came quite easily to his lips to ask _me_ to write to him,--a high  honour, likewise an order. But K. is my soldier chief. As C.-in-C. in  India he refused point blank to write letters to autocratic John Morley  behind the back of the Viceroy, and Morley never forgave him. K. told me  this himself and he told me also that he resented the correspondence  which was, he knew, being carried on, behind his (K.'s) back, between  the army in France and his (K.'s) own political Boss: that sort of  action was, he considered, calculated to undermine authority.    I have had a long talk with Braithwaite _re_ this quandary. He strongly  holds that my first duty is to K. and that it is for us a question of K.  and no one but K. Were the S. of S. only a civilian (instead of being a  Field Marshal) the case _might_ admit of argument; as things are, it  does not. So have written the P.M. on these lines and shall send K. the  carbons of all my letters to him. To K. himself I have written backing  up my cable and begging for a Brigade of Gurkhas. Really, it is like  going up to a tiger and asking for a small slice of venison: I remember  only too well his warning not to make his position "]]]
