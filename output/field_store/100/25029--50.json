I know that I stopped dead, one foot within the room, for the malignant  force of the man was something surpassing my experience.  He was  surprised by this sudden intrusion--yes, but no trace of fear showed  upon that wonderful face, only a sort of pitying contempt.  And, as I  paused, he rose slowly to his feet, never removing his gaze from mine.    \"IT'S FU-MANCHU!\" cried Smith over my shoulder, in a voice that was  almost a scream.  \"IT'S FU-MANCHU!  Cover him!  Shoot him dead if--\"    The conclusion of that sentence I never heard.    Dr. Fu-Manchu reached down beside the table, and the floor slipped from  under me.    One last glimpse I had of the fixed green eyes, and with a scream I was  unable to repress I dropped, dropped, dropped, and plunged into icy  water, which closed over my head.    Vaguely I had seen a spurt of flame, had heard another cry following my  own, a booming sound (the trap), the flat note of a police whistle.  But when I rose to the surface impenetrable darkness enveloped me; I  was spitting filthy, oily liquid from my mouth, and fighting down the  black terror that had me by the throat--terror of the darkness about  me, of the unknown depths beneath me, of the pit into which I was cast  amid stifling stenches and the lapping of tidal water.    \"Smith!\" I cried. . . . \"Help!  Help!\"    My voice seemed to beat back upon me, yet I was about to cry out again,  when, mustering all my presence of mind and all my failing courage, I  recognized that I had better employment of my energies, and began to  swim straight ahead, desperately determined to face all the horrors of  this place--to die hard if die I must.    A drop of liquid fire fell through the darkness and hissed into the  water beside me!    I felt that, despite my resolution, I was going mad.    Another fiery drop--and another!    I touched a rotting wooden post and slimy timbers.  I had reached one  bound of my watery prison.  More fire fell from above, and the scream  of hysteria quivered, unuttered, in my throat.    Keeping myself afloat with increasing difficulty in my heavy garments,  I threw my head back and raised my eyes.    No more drops fell, and no more drops would fall; but it was merely a  question of time for the floor to collapse.  For it was beginning to  emit a dull, red glow.    The room above me was in flames!    It was drops of burning oil from the lamp, finding passage through the  cracks in the crazy flooring, which had fallen about me--for the death  trap had reclosed, I suppose, mechanically.    My saturated garments were dragging me down, and now I could hear the  flames hungrily eating into the ancient rottenness overhead.  Shortly  that cauldron would be loosed upon my head.  The glow of the flames  grew brighter . . . and showed me the half-rotten piles upholding the  building, showed me the tidal mark upon the slime-coated walls--showed  me that there was no escape!    By some subterranean duct the foul place was fed from the Thames.  By  that duct, with the outgoing tide, my body would pass, in the wake of  Mason, Cadby, and many another victim!    Rusty iron rungs were affixed to one of the walls communicating with a  trap--but the bottom three were missing!    Brighter and brighter grew the awesome light the light of what should  be my funeral pyre--reddening the oily water and adding a new dread to  the whispering, clammy horror of the pit.  But something it showed  me . . . a projecting beam a few feet above the water . . . and directly  below the iron ladder!    \"Merciful Heaven!\" I breathed.  \"Have I the strength?\"    A desire for laughter claimed me with sudden, all but irresistible  force.  I knew what it portended and fought it down--grimly, sternly.    My garments weighed upon me like a suit of mail; with my chest aching  dully, my veins throbbing to bursting, I forced tired muscles to work,  and, every stroke an agony, approached the beam.  Nearer I swam  . . . nearer.  Its shadow fell black upon the water, which now had all  the seeming of a pool of blood.  Confused sounds--a remote uproar--came  to my ears.  I was nearly spent . . . I was in the shadow of the beam!  If  I could throw up one arm. . .    A shrill scream sounded far above me!    \"Petrie!  Petrie!\"  (That voice must be Smith's!)  \"Don't touch the  beam!  For God's sake DON'T TOUCH THE BEAM!  Keep afloat another few  seconds and I can get to you!\"    Another few seconds!  Was that possible?    I managed to turn, to raise my throbbing head; and I saw the strangest  sight which that night yet had offered.    Nayland Smith stood upon the lowest iron rung . . . supported by the  hideous, crook-backed Chinaman, who stood upon the rung above!    \"I can't reach him!\"    It was as Smith hissed the words despairingly that I looked up--and saw  the Chinaman snatch at his coiled pigtail and pull it off!  With it  came the wig to which it was attached; and the ghastly yellow mask,  deprived of its fastenings, fell from position!  \"Here!  Here!  Be  quick!  Oh!  be quick!  You can lower this to him!  Be quick!  Be  quick!\"    A cloud of hair came falling about the slim shoulders as the speaker  bent to pass this strange lifeline to Smith; and I think it was my  wonder at knowing her for the girl whom that day I had surprised in  Cadby's rooms which saved my life.    For I not only kept afloat, but kept my gaze upturned to that  beautiful, flushed face, and my eyes fixed upon hers--which were wild  with fear . . . for me!    Smith, by some contortion, got the false queue into my grasp, and I,  with the strength of desperation, by that means seized hold upon the  lowest rung.  With my friend's arm round me I realized that exhaustion  was even nearer than I had supposed.  My last distinct memory is of the  bursting of the floor above and the big burning joist hissing into the  pool beneath us.  Its fiery passage, striated with light, disclosed two  sword blades, riveted, edges up along the top of the beam which I had  striven to reach.    \"The severed fingers--\" I said; and swooned.    How Smith got me through the trap I do not know--nor how we made our  way through the smoke and flames of the narrow passage it opened upon.  My next recollection is of sitting up, with my friend's arm supporting  me and Inspector Ryman holding a glass to my lips.    A bright glare dazzled my eyes.  A crowd surged about us, and a clangor  and shouting drew momentarily nearer.    \"It's the engines coming,\" explained Smith, seeing my bewilderment.  \"Shen-Yan's is in flames.  It was your shot, as you fell through the  trap, broke the oil-lamp.\"    \"Is everybody out?\"    \"So far as we know.\"    \"Fu-Manchu?\"    Smith shrugged his shoulders.    \"No one has seen him.  There was some door at the back--\"    \"Do you think he may--\"    \"No,\" he said tensely.  \"Not until I see him lying dead before me shall  I believe it.\"    Then memory resumed its sway.  I struggled to my feet.    \"Smith, where is she?\" I cried.  \"Where is she?\"    \"I don't know,\" he answered.    \"She's given us the slip, Doctor,\" said Inspector Weymouth, as a  fire-engine came swinging round the corner of the narrow lane.  \"So has  Mr. Singapore Charlie--and, I'm afraid, somebody else.  We've got six  or eight all-sorts, some awake and some asleep, but I suppose we shall  have to let 'em go again.  Mr. Smith tells me that the girl was  disguised as a Chinaman.  I expect that's why she managed to slip away.\"    I recalled how I had been dragged from the pit by the false queue, how  the strange discovery which had brought death to poor Cadby had brought  life to me, and I seemed to remember, too, that Smith had dropped it as  he threw his arm about me on the ladder.  Her mask the girl might have  retained, but her wig, I felt certain, had been dropped into the water.    It was later that night, when the brigade still were playing upon the  blackened shell of what had been Shen-Yan's opium-shop, and Smith and I  were speeding away in a cab from the scene of God knows how many  crimes, that I had an idea.    \"Smith,\" I said, \"did you bring the pigtail with you that was found on  Cadby?\"    \"Yes.  I had hoped to meet the owner.\"    \"Have you got it now?\"    \"No. I met the owner.\"    I thrust my hands deep into the pockets of the big pea-jacket lent to  me by Inspector Ryman, leaning back in my corner.    \"We shall never really excel at this business,\" continued Nayland  Smith.  \"We are far too sentimental.  I knew what it meant to us,  Petrie, what it meant to the world, but I hadn't the heart.  I owed her  your life--I had to square the account.\"        CHAPTER VII      NIGHT fell on Redmoat.  I glanced from the window at the nocturne in  silver and green which lay beneath me.  To the west of the shrubbery,  with its broken canopy of elms and beyond the copper beech which marked  the center of its mazes, a gap offered a glimpse of the Waverney where  it swept into a broad.  Faint bird-calls floated over the water.  These, with the whisper of leaves, alone claimed the ear.    Ideal rural peace, and the music of an English summer evening; but to  my eyes, every shadow holding fantastic terrors; to my ears, every  sound a signal of dread.  For the deathful hand of Fu-Manchu was  stretched over Redmoat, at any hour to loose strange, Oriental horrors  upon its inmates.    \"Well,\" said Nayland Smith, joining me at the window, \"we had dared to  hope him dead, but we know now that he lives!\"    The Rev. J. D. Eltham coughed nervously, and I turned, leaning my elbow  upon the table, and studied the play of expression upon the refined,  sensitive face of the clergyman.    \"You think I acted rightly in sending for you, Mr. Smith?\"    Nayland Smith smoked furiously.    \"Mr. Eltham,\" he replied, \"you see in me a man groping in the dark.  I  am to-day no nearer to the conclusion of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#9)"],[1,", without meeting the slightest hint  which could lead to the inference that there is open country within  reach, is a strange thing.  This colossal centralisation, this heaping  together of two and a half millions of human beings at one point, has  multiplied the power of this two and a half millions a hundredfold; has  raised London to the commercial capital of the world, created the giant  docks and assembled the thousand vessels that continually cover the  Thames.  I know nothing more imposing than the view which the Thames  offers during the ascent from the sea to London Bridge.  The masses of  buildings, the wharves on both sides, especially from Woolwich upwards,  the countless ships along both shores, crowding ever closer and closer  together, until, at last, only a narrow passage remains in the middle of  the river, a passage through which hundreds of steamers shoot by one  another; all this is so vast, so impressive, that a man cannot collect  himself, but is lost in the marvel of England's greatness before he sets  foot upon English soil. {23}    But the sacrifices which all this has cost become apparent later.  After  roaming the streets of the capital a day or two, making headway with  difficulty through the human turmoil and the endless lines of vehicles,  after visiting the slums of the metropolis, one realises for the first  time that these Londoners have been forced to sacrifice the best  qualities of their human nature, to bring to pass all the marvels of  civilisation which crowd their city; that a hundred powers which  slumbered within them have remained inactive, have been suppressed in  order that a few might be developed more fully and multiply through union  with those of others.  The very turmoil of the streets has something  repulsive, something against which human nature rebels.  The hundreds of  thousands of all classes and ranks crowding past each other, are they not  all human beings with the same qualities and powers, and with the same  interest in being happy?  And have they not, in the end, to seek  happiness in the same way, by the same means?  And still they crowd by  one another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to do with one  another, and their only agreement is the tacit one, that each keep to his  own side of the pavement, so as not to delay the opposing streams of the  crowd, while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much as a  glance.  The brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each in his  private interest becomes the more repellant and offensive, the more these  individuals are crowded together, within a limited space.  And, however  much one may be aware that this isolation of the individual, this narrow  self-seeking is the fundamental principle of our society everywhere, it  is nowhere so shamelessly barefaced, so self-conscious as just here in  the crowding of the great city.  The dissolution of mankind into monads,  of which each one has a separate principle, the world of atoms, is here  carried out to its utmost extreme.    Hence it comes, too, that the social war, the war of each against all, is  here openly declared.  Just as in Stirner's recent book, people regard  each other only as useful objects; each exploits the other, and the end  of it all is, that the stronger treads the weaker under foot, and that  the powerful few, the capitalists, seize everything for themselves, while  to the weak many, the poor, scarcely a bare existence remains.    What is true of London, is true of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, is true  of all great towns.  Everywhere barbarous indifference, hard egotism on  one hand, and nameless misery on the other, everywhere social warfare,  every man's house in a state of siege, everywhere reciprocal plundering  under the protection of the law, and all so shameless, so openly avowed  that one shrinks before the consequences of our social state as they  manifest themselves here undisguised, and can only wonder that the whole  crazy fabric still hangs together.    Since capital, the direct or indirect control of the means of subsistence  and production, is the weapon with which this social warfare is carried  on, it is clear that all the disadvantages of such a state must fall upon  the poor.  For him no man has the slightest concern.  Cast into the  whirlpool, he must struggle through as well as he can.  If he is so happy  as to find work, _i.e_., if the bourgeoisie does him the favour to enrich  itself by means of him, wages await him which scarcely suffice to keep  body and soul together; if he can get no work he may steal, if he is not  afraid of the police, or starve, in which case the police will take care  that he does so in a quiet and inoffensive manner.  During my residence  in England, at least twenty or thirty persons have died of simple  starvation under the most revolting circumstances, and a jury has rarely  been found possessed of the courage to speak the plain truth in the  matter.  Let the testimony of the witnesses be never so clear and  unequivocal, the bourgeoisie, from which the jury is selected, always  finds some backdoor through which to escape the frightful verdict, death  from starvation.  The bourgeoisie dare not speak the truth in these  cases, for it would speak its own condemnation.  But indirectly, far more  than directly, many have died of starvation, where long continued want of  proper nourishment has called forth fatal illness, when it has produced  such debility that causes which might otherwise have remained  inoperative, brought on severe illness and death.  The English working-  men call this \"social murder,\" and accuse our whole society of  perpetrating this crime perpetually.  Are they wrong?    True, it is only individuals who starve, but what security has the  working-man that it may not be his turn to-morrow?  Who assures him  employment, who vouches for it that, if for any reason or no reason his  lord and master discharges him to-morrow, he can struggle along with  those dependent upon him, until he may find some one else \"to give him  bread?\"  Who guarantees that willingness to work shall suffice to obtain  work, that uprightness, industry, thrift, and the rest of the virtues  recommended by the bourgeoisie, are really his road to happiness?  No  one.  He knows that he has something to-day, and that it does not depend  upon himself whether he shall have something to-morrow.  He knows that  every breeze that blows, every whim of his employer, every bad turn of  trade may hurl him back into the fierce whirlpool from which he has  temporarily saved himself, and in which it is hard and often impossible  to keep his head above water.  He knows that, though he may have the  means of living to-day, it is very uncertain whether he shall to-morrow.    Meanwhile, let us proceed to a more detailed investigation of the  position, in which the social war has placed the non-possessing class.  Let us see what pay for his work society does give the working-man in the  form of dwelling, clothing, food, what sort of subsistence it grants  those who contribute most to the maintenance of society; and, first, let  us consider the dwellings.    Every great city has one or more slums, where the working-class is  crowded together.  True, poverty often dwells in hidden alleys close to  the palaces of the rich; but, in general, a separate territory has been  assigned to it, where, removed from the sight of the happier classes, it  may struggle along as it can.  These slums are pretty equally arranged in  all the great towns of England, the worst houses in the worst quarters of  the towns; usually one or two-storied cottages in long rows, perhaps with  cellars used as dwellings, almost always irregularly built.  These houses  of three or four rooms and a kitchen form, throughout England, some parts  of London excepted, the general dwellings of the working-class.  The  streets are generally unpaved, rough, dirty, filled with vegetable and  animal refuse, without sewers or gutters, but supplied with foul,  stagnant pools instead.  Moreover, ventilation is impeded by the bad,  confused method of building of the whole quarter, and since many human  beings here live crowded into a small space, the atmosphere that prevails  in these working-men's quarters may readily be imagined.  Further, the  streets serve as drying grounds in fine weather; lines are stretched  across from house to house, and hung with wet clothing.    Let us investigate some of the slums in their order.  London comes first,  and in London the famous rookery of St. Giles which is now, at last,  about to be penetrated by a couple of broad streets.  St. Giles is in the  midst of the most populous part of the town, surrounded by broad,  splendid avenues in which the gay world of London idles about, in the  immediate neighbourhood of Oxford Street, Regent Street, of Trafalgar  Square and the Strand.  It is a disorderly collection of tall, three or  four-storied houses, with narrow, crooked, filthy streets, in which there  is quite as much life as in the great thoroughfares of the town, except  that, here, people of the working-class only are to be seen.  A vegetable  market is held in the street, baskets with vegetables and fruits,  naturally all bad and hardly fit to use, obstruct the sidewalk still  further, and from these, as well as from the fish-dealers' stalls, arises  a horrible smell.  The houses are occupied from cellar to garret, filthy  within and without, and their appearance is such that no human being  could possibly wish to live in them.  But all this is nothing in  comparison with the dwellings in the narrow courts and alleys between the  streets, entered by covered passages between the houses, in which the  filth and tottering ruin surpass all description.  Scarcely a whole  window-pane can be found, the walls are crumbling, door-posts and window-  frames loose and broken, doors of old boards nailed together,"]]]
