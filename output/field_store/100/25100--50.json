Notwithstanding the  fact that during the whole of this time we were also harassed by  small-arm fire, we lost--incredible as it may appear--not more than one  killed and one wounded, and a few horses besides. The positions which we  had abandoned the British now occupied, hemming in General Cronje so  closely that he had not the slightest chance of breaking through their  lines.    No sooner had we got out of range of the enemy's fire, than the first of  the reinforcements, which we had expected from Bloemfontein, arrived,  under the command of Vechtgeneraal Andreas Cronje. With him were  Commandants Thewnissen, of Winburg, and Vilonel, of Senekal.    A council was at once held as to the best method of effecting the  release of General Cronje. It was decided to recapture the positions  which I had abandoned. But now the situation was so changed that there  were _three_ positions which it was necessary for us to take. We agreed  that the attack should be made by three separate parties, that General  Philip Botha, with Commandant Thewnissen, should retake the positions  which we had abandoned at Stinkfontein, General Froneman the position  immediately to the north of these, and I, with General Andreas Cronje,  others still further north.    The attack was made on the following morning. General Botha's attempt  failed, chiefly owing to the fact that day dawned before he reached his  position; a hot fight ensued, resulting in the capture of Commandant  Thewnissen and about one hundred men. As I was so placed as to be unable  to see how affairs were developing, it is difficult for me to hazard an  opinion as to whether Commandant Thewnissen was lacking in caution, or  whether he was insufficiently supported by General Botha. The burghers  who were present at the engagement accused General Botha, while he  declared that Thewnissen had been imprudent. However that may be, we had  failed in our essay. The position had not been taken, and Commandant  Thewnissen, with a hundred whom we could ill spare, were in the hands of  the enemy, And to make matters still worse, our men were already seized  with panic, arising from the now hopeless plight of General Cronje and  his large force.    I, however, was not prepared to abandon all hope as yet. Danie Theron,  that famous captain of despatch-riders, had arrived on the previous day  with reinforcements. I asked him if he would take a verbal message to  General Cronje--I dare not send a written one, lest it should fall into  the hands of the English. Proud and distinct the answer came at  once--the only answer which such a hero as Danie Theron could have  given:    \"Yes, General, I will go.\"    The risk which I was asking him to run could not have been surpassed  throughout the whole of our sanguinary struggle.    I took him aside, and told him that he must go and tell General Cronje  that our fate depended upon the escape of himself and of the thousands  with him, and that, if he should fall into the enemy's hands, it would  be the death-blow to all our hopes. Theron was to urge Cronje to  abandon the laager, and everything contained in it, to fight his way out  by night, and to meet me at two named places, where I would protect him  from the pursuit of the English.    Danie Theron undertook to pass the enemy's lines, and to deliver my  message. He started on his errand on the night of the 25th of February.    The following evening I went to the place of meeting, but to my great  disappointment General Cronje did not appear.    On the morning of the 27th of February Theron returned. He had performed  an exploit unequalled in the war. Both in going and returning he had  crawled past the British sentries, tearing his trousers to rags during  the process. The blood was running from his knees, where the skin had  been scraped off. He told me that he had seen the General, who had said  that he did not think that the plan which I had proposed had any good  chance of success.    At ten o'clock that day, General Cronje surrendered. Bitter was my  disappointment. Alas! my last attempt had been all in vain. The stubborn  General would not listen to good advice.    I must repeat here what I have said before, that as far as my personal  knowledge of General Cronje goes, it is evident to me that his obstinacy  in maintaining his position must be ascribed to the fact that it was too  much to ask him--intrepid hero that he was--to abandon the laager. His  view was that he must stand or fall with it, nor did he consider the  certain consequences of his capture. He never realized that it would be  the cause of the death of many burghers, and of indescribable panic  throughout not only all the laagers on the veldt, but even those of  Colesberg, Stormberg and Ladysmith. If the famous Cronje were captured,  how could any ordinary burgher be expected to continue his resistance?    It may be that it was the will of God, who rules the destinies of all  nations, to fill thus to the brim the cup which we had to empty, but  this consideration does not excuse General Cronje's conduct. Had he but  taken my advice, and attempted a night attack, he might have avoided  capture altogether.    I have heard men say that as the General's horses had all been killed,  the attempt which I urged him to make must have failed--that at all  events he would have been pursued and overtaken by Lord Roberts' forces.  The answer to this is not far to seek. The English at that time did not  employ as scouts Kaffirs and Hottentots, who could lead them by night as  well as by day. Moreover, with the reinforcements I had received, I had  about sixteen hundred men under me, and they would have been very useful  in holding back the enemy, until Cronje had made his escape.    No words can describe my feelings when I saw that Cronje had  surrendered, and noticed the result which this had on the burghers.  Depression and discouragement were written on every face. The effects of  this blow, it is not too much to say, made themselves apparent to the  very end of the war.    [Footnote 22: \"How is it with you?\"]    [Footnote 23: Eleven or twelve days after, Commandant Spruit was again  with us. When he appeared, he seemed to us like one risen from the dead.  We all rejoiced, not only because he was a God-fearing man, but also  because he was of a lovable disposition. I heard from his own mouth how  he had escaped. He told me that the day after his capture, he was sent,  under a strong escort, from Lord Roberts' Headquarters to the railway  station at Modder River, and that he started from there, with a guard of  six men on his road to Cape Town. During the night as they drew near De  Aar, his guards fell asleep, and our brave Commandant prepared to leave  the train. He seized a favourable opportunity when the engine was  climbing a steep gradient and jumped off. But the pace was fast enough  to throw him to the ground, though fortunately he only sustained slight  injury. When daylight came he hid himself. Having made out his bearings  he began to make his way back on the following night. He passed a house,  but dared not seek admission, for he did not know who its occupants  might be. As he had no food with him, his sufferings from hunger were  great, but still he persevered, concealing himself during the day, and  only walking during the hours of darkness. At last he reached the  railway line to the north of Colesberg, and from there was carried to  Bloemfontein, where he enjoyed a well-earned rest. In the second week of  March he returned to his commando, to the great delight of everybody.]          CHAPTER VII    The Wild Flight from Poplar Grove      The surrender of General Cronje only made me all the more determined to  continue the struggle, notwithstanding the fact that many of the  burghers appeared to have quite lost heart. I had just been appointed  Commander-in-Chief, and at once set my hand to the work before me.    Let me explain how this came about.    As I have already said, General C.J. Wessels had been appointed  Commander-in-Chief at Kimberley. In the month of January he was  succeeded by Mr. J.S. Ferreira, who at once proceeded to make Kimberley  his headquarters. On the relief of that town, one part of the besieging  force went to Viertienstroomen, another in the direction of Boshof,  while a small party, in which was the Commander-in-Chief himself, set  out towards Koedoesrand, above Paardeberg.    It was while I was engaged in my efforts to relieve Cronje, that a gun  accident occurred in which General Ferreira was fatally wounded. Not  only his own family, but the whole nation, lost in him a man whom they  can never forget. I received the sad news the day after his death, and,  although the place of his burial was not more than two hours' ride from  my camp, I was too much occupied with my own affairs to be able to  attend his funeral.    On the following day I received from President Steyn the appointment of  Vice-Commander-in-Chief. I had no thought of declining it, but the work  which it would involve seemed likely to prove anything but easy. To have  the chief command, and at such a time as this! But I had to make the  best of it.    I began by concentrating my commandos, to the best of my ability, at  Modderrivierpoort (Poplar Grove), ten miles east of the scene of  Cronje's surrender. I had plenty of time to effect this, for Lord  Roberts remained inactive from the 24th of February to the 7th of March,  in order to rest a little after the gigantic task he had performed in  capturing Cronje's laager. His thoughts must have been busy during that  period with even more serious matters than the care of his weary troops;  for, if we had had two hundred killed and wounded, he must have lost as  many thousands.    Those few days during which our enemy rested were also of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1881"],[0,"The Call of the Canyon (#9)"],[1,"the trail, she stepped out  briskly, now giving attention to her surroundings. The canyon had  widened, and the creek with its deep thicket of green and white had  sheered to the left. On her right the canyon wall appeared to be lifting  higher--and higher. She could not see it well, owing to intervening  treetops. The trail led her through a grove of maples and sycamores, out  into an open park-like bench that turned to the right toward the cliff.  Suddenly Carley saw a break in the red wall. It was the intersecting  canyon, West Fork. What a narrow red-walled gateway! Huge pine trees  spread wide gnarled branches over her head. The wind made soft rush in  their tops, sending the brown needles lightly on the air. Carley turned  the bulging corner, to be halted by a magnificent spectacle. It seemed  a mountain wall loomed over her. It was the western side of this canyon,  so lofty that Carley had to tip back her head to see the top. She swept  her astonished gaze down the face of this tremendous red mountain wall  and then slowly swept it upward again. This phenomenon of a cliff seemed  beyond the comprehension of her sight. It looked a mile high. The  few trees along its bold rampart resembled short spear-pointed bushes  outlined against the steel gray of sky. Ledges, caves, seams, cracks,  fissures, beetling red brows, yellow crumbling crags, benches of green  growths and niches choked with brush, and bold points where single  lonely pine trees grew perilously, and blank walls a thousand feet  across their shadowed faces--these features gradually took shape in  Carley's confused sight, until the colossal mountain front stood up  before her in all its strange, wild, magnificent ruggedness and beauty.    \"Arizona! Perhaps this is what he meant,\" murmured Carley. \"I never  dreamed of anything like this.... But, oh! it overshadows me--bears me  down! I could never have a moment's peace under it.\"    It fascinated her. There were inaccessible ledges that haunted her with  their remote fastnesses. How wonderful would it be to get there, rest  there, if that were possible! But only eagles could reach them. There  were places, then, that the desecrating hands of man could not touch.  The dark caves were mystically potent in their vacant staring out at  the world beneath them. The crumbling crags, the toppling ledges, the  leaning rocks all threatened to come thundering down at the breath of  wind. How deep and soft the red color in contrast with the green! How  splendid the sheer bold uplift of gigantic steps! Carley found herself  marveling at the forces that had so rudely, violently, and grandly left  this monument to nature.    \"Well, old Fifth Avenue gadder!\" called a gay voice. \"If the back wall  of my yard so halts you--what will you ever do when you see the Painted  Desert, or climb Sunset Peak, or look down into the Grand Canyon?\"    \"Oh, Glenn, where are you?\" cried Carley, gazing everywhere near at  hand. But he was farther away. The clearness of his voice had deceived  her. Presently she espied him a little distance away, across a creek she  had not before noticed.    \"Come on,\" he called. \"I want to see you cross the stepping stones.\"    Carley ran ahead, down a little slope of clean red rock, to the shore of  the green water. It was clear, swift, deep in some places and shallow in  others, with white wreathes or ripples around the rocks evidently placed  there as a means to cross. Carley drew back aghast.    \"Glenn, I could never make it,\" she called.    \"Come on, my Alpine climber,\" he taunted. \"Will you let Arizona daunt  you?\"    \"Do you want me to fall in and catch cold?\" she cried, desperately.    \"Carley, big women might even cross the bad places of modern life on  stepping stones of their dead selves!\" he went on, with something of  mockery. \"Surely a few physical steps are not beyond you.\"    \"Say, are you mangling Tennyson or just kidding me?\" she demanded  slangily.    \"My love, Flo could cross here with her eyes shut.\"    That thrust spurred Carley to action. His words were jest, yet they held  a hint of earnest. With her heart at her throat Carley stepped on the  first rock, and, poising, she calculated on a running leap from stone to  stone. Once launched, she felt she was falling downhill. She swayed, she  splashed, she slipped; and clearing the longest leap from the last stone  to shore she lost her balance and fell into Glenn's arms. His kisses  drove away both her panic and her resentment.    \"By Jove! I didn't think you'd even attempt it!\" he declared, manifestly  pleased. \"I made sure I'd have to pack you over--in fact, rather liked  the idea.\"    \"I wouldn't advise you to employ any such means again--to dare me,\" she  retorted.    \"That's a nifty outdoor suit you've on,\" he said, admiringly. \"I was  wondering what you'd wear. I like short outing skirts for women, rather  than trousers. The service sort of made the fair sex dippy about pants.\"    \"It made them dippy about more than that,\" she replied. \"You and I will  never live to see the day that women recover their balance.\"    \"I agree with you,\" replied Glenn.    Carley locked her arm in his. \"Honey, I want to have a good time today.  Cut out all the other women stuff.... Take me to see your little gray  home in the West. Or is it gray?\"    He laughed. \"Why, yes, it's gray, just about. The logs have bleached  some.\"    Glenn led her away up a trail that climbed between bowlders, and  meandered on over piny mats of needles under great, silent, spreading  pines; and closer to the impondering mountain wall, where at the base of  the red rock the creek murmured strangely with hollow gurgle, where  the sun had no chance to affect the cold damp gloom; and on through  sweet-smelling woods, out into the sunlight again, and across a wider  breadth of stream; and up a slow slope covered with stately pines, to a  little cabin that faced the west.    \"Here we are, sweetheart,\" said Glenn. \"Now we shall see what you are  made of.\"    Carley was non-committal as to that. Her intense interest precluded any  humor at this moment. Not until she actually saw the log cabin Glenn had  erected with his own hands had she been conscious of any great interest.  But sight of it awoke something unaccustomed in Carley. As she stepped  into the cabin her heart was not acting normally for a young woman who  had no illusions about love in a cottage.    Glenn's cabin contained one room about fifteen feet wide by twenty long.  Between the peeled logs were lines of red mud, hard dried. There was a  small window opposite the door. In one corner was a couch of poles, with  green tips of pine boughs peeping from under the blankets. The floor  consisted of flat rocks laid irregularly, with many spaces of earth  showing between. The open fireplace appeared too large for the room,  but the very bigness of it, as well as the blazing sticks and glowing  embers, appealed strongly to Carley. A rough-hewn log formed the mantel,  and on it Carley's picture held the place of honor. Above this a rifle  lay across deer antlers. Carley paused here in her survey long enough to  kiss Glenn and point to her photograph.    \"You couldn't have pleased me more.\"    To the left of the fireplace was a rude cupboard of shelves, packed with  boxes, cans, bags, and utensils. Below the cupboard, hung upon pegs,  were blackened pots and pans, a long-handled skillet, and a bucket.  Glenn's table was a masterpiece. There was no danger of knocking it  over. It consisted of four poles driven into the ground, upon which had  been nailed two wide slabs. This table showed considerable evidence of  having been scrubbed scrupulously clean. There were two low stools, made  out of boughs, and the seats had been covered with woolly sheep hide. In  the right-hand corner stood a neat pile of firewood, cut with an ax,  and beyond this hung saddle and saddle blanket, bridle and spurs. An old  sombrero was hooked upon the pommel of the saddle. Upon the wall, higher  up, hung a lantern, resting in a coil of rope that Carley took to be a  lasso. Under a shelf upon which lay a suitcase hung some rough wearing  apparel.    Carley noted that her picture and the suit case were absolutely the only  physical evidences of Glenn's connection with his Eastern life. That had  an unaccountable effect upon Carley. What had she expected? Then, after  another survey of the room, she began to pester Glenn with questions. He  had to show her the spring outside and the little bench with basin and  soap. Sight of his soiled towel made her throw up her hands. She sat on  the stools. She lay on the couch. She rummaged into the contents of the  cupboard. She threw wood on the fire. Then, finally, having exhausted  her search and inquiry, she flopped down on one of the stools to gaze at  Glenn in awe and admiration and incredulity.    \"Glenn--you've actually lived here!\" she ejaculated.    \"Since last fall before the snow came,\" he said, smiling.    \"Snow! Did it snow?\" she inquired.    \"Well, I guess. I was snowed in for a week.\"    \"Why did you choose this lonely place--way off from the Lodge?\" she  asked, slowly.    \"I wanted to be by myself,\" he replied, briefly.    \"You mean this is a sort of camp-out place?\"    \"Carley, I call it my home,\" he replied, and there was a low, strong  sweetness in his voice she had never heard before.    That silenced her for a while. She went to the door and gazed up at the  towering wall, more wonderful than ever, and more fearful, too, in  her sight. Presently tears dimmed her eyes. She did not understand her  feeling; she was ashamed of it; she hid it from Glenn. Indeed, there was  something terribly wrong between her and Glenn, and it was not in him.  This cabin he called home gave her a shock which would take time to  analyze. At length she turned to him with gay utterance upon her  lips. She tried to put out of her mind a dawning sense that this  close-to-the-earth habitation, this"]]]
