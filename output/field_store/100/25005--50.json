It is indeed of them  that it hath been said: \"These are the abject and foolish, who follow  every clamorous impostor and who bend with every changing wind.\"(58) The  stages of this journey, station, and abode are clear and manifest to thee  and require no further explanation.    91 Know then that all thou hast heard and witnessed that Daystar of Truth,  the Primal Point, ascribe to Himself from the designations of former times  is only on account of the weakness of men and the scheme of the world of  creation. Otherwise, all names and attributes revolve round His Essence  and circle about the threshold of His sanctuary. For He it is Who traineth  all names, revealeth all attributes, conferreth life upon all beings,  proclaimeth the divine verses, and arrayeth the heavenly signs. Nay,  shouldst thou gaze with thine inner eye, thou wouldst find that all save  Him fade into utter nothingness and are as a thing forgotten in His holy  presence. \"God was alone; there was none else besides Him. He remaineth  now what He hath ever been.\" Since it hath been established that  God--hallowed and glorified be He!--was alone and there was none besides  Him, how can the law of change and transformation apply here? Shouldst  thou reflect upon that which We have disclosed unto thee, the daystar of  guidance would shine resplendent before thee in this everlasting morn, and  thou wouldst be numbered therein with the pious.    92 Know, moreover, that all that We have mentioned concerning these  journeys is intended for none but the elect amongst the righteous. And  shouldst thou spur on the charger of the spirit and traverse the meads of  heaven, thou wouldst complete all these journeys and discover every  mystery in less than the twinkling of an eye.    93 O My brother! If thou be a champion of this arena, speed within the  lands of certitude, that thy soul may be delivered in this day from the  bondage of misbelief, and that thou mayest perceive the sweet savours that  waft from this garden. Verily, the perfume-laden breezes that carry the  fragrance of this city blow over all regions. Forfeit not thy portion  thereof and be not of the heedless. How well hath it been said:    94      His fragrant breaths diffused in Eastern lands could well    To sick ones in the West restore their sense of smell!(59)    95 After this heavenly journey and mystical ascent the wayfarer will enter  within the Garden of Wonderment. Were I to disclose unto thee the reality  of this station, thou wouldst lament and bewail the plight of this Servant  Who remaineth in the hands of these infidels, Who hath grown perplexed at  his plight, and is lost in bewilderment in this fathomless ocean. They  conspire each day to put Me to death, and seek at every hour to banish Me  from this land, even as they banished Me from another land. Yet this  Servant standeth ready before them, awaiting whatsoever the Almighty hath  ordained and decreed for Us. Nor do I fear any soul, encompassed as We may  be by such trials and tribulations as are inflicted by the wicked and the  malicious and surrounded at this hour by a myriad woes and sorrows.  \"Noah's flood is but the measure of the tears I have shed, and Abraham's  fire an ebullition of My soul. Jacob's grief is but a reflection of My  sorrows, and Job's afflictions a fraction of My calamity.\"(60)    96 Were I to recount unto thine eminence the dire adversities that have  befallen Me, thou wouldst be so grieved as to forsake the mention of all  things and to forget thyself and all that the Lord hath created on earth.  But as this is not Our wish, I have concealed the revelation of the divine  decree in the heart of Baha and veiled it from the eyes of all that move  in the realm of creation, that it may lay hid within the tabernacle of the  Unseen until such time as God will have revealed its secret. \"Naught in  the heavens or on the earth can escape His knowledge, and He, verily,  perceiveth all things.\"(61)    97 As We have digressed from Our theme, let Us leave aside these allusions  and return to Our discussion of this city. Verily, whoso entereth therein  shall be saved, and whoso turneth aside therefrom will assuredly perish.    98 O thou who art mentioned in these Tablets! Know thou that he who  embarketh upon this journey will marvel at the signs of the power of God  and the wondrous evidences of His handiwork. Bewilderment will seize him  from every side, even as hath been attested by that Essence of immortality  from the Concourse on high: \"Increase My wonder and amazement at Thee, O  God!\"(62) Well hath it been said:    99      I knew not what amazement was      Until I made Thy love my cause.    O how amazing would it be      If I were not amazed by Thee!(63)    100 In this valley the wayfarers stray and perish ere they attain their  final abode. Gracious God! So immense is this valley, so vast this city in  the kingdom of creation, that it seemeth to have neither beginning nor  end. How great the blessedness of him who completeth his journey therein  and who traverseth, through the assistance of God, the hallowed soil of  this heavenly city, a city in which the favoured ones of God and the pure  in heart are overcome with wonder and awe. And We say: \"Praise be to God,  the Lord of the worlds.\"    101 And should the servant ascend to even loftier heights, quit this  mortal world of dust, and seek to ascend unto the celestial abode, he will  then pass from this city into the City of Absolute Nothingness, that is,  of dying to self and living in God. In this station, this most exalted  habitation, this journey of utter self-effacement, the wayfarer forgetteth  his soul, spirit, body, and very being, immerseth himself in the sea of  nothingness, and liveth on earth as one unworthy of mention. Nor will one  find any sign of his existence, for he hath vanished from the realm of the  visible and attained unto the heights of self-abnegation.    102 Were We to recount the mysteries of this city, the dominions of the  hearts of men would be laid to waste in the intensity of their longing for  this mighty station. For this is the station wherein the effulgent glories  of the Beloved are revealed to the sincere lover and the resplendent  lights of the Friend are cast upon the severed heart that is devoted to  Him.    103 How can a true lover continue to exist when once the effulgent glories  of the Beloved are revealed? How can the shadow endure when once the sun  hath shone forth? How can a devoted heart have any being before the  existence of the Object of its devotion? Nay, by the One in Whose hand is  my soul! In this station, the seeker's complete surrender and utter  effacement before his Creator will be such that, were he to search the  East and the West, and traverse land, sea, mountain and plain, he would  find no trace of his own self or of any other soul.    104 Gracious God! But for fear of the Nimrod of tyranny and for the  protection of the Abraham of justice, I would reveal unto thee that which,  wert thou to abandon self and desire, would enable thee to dispense with  aught else and to draw nigh unto this city. Be patient, however, until  such time as God will have proclaimed His Cause. He, verily, rewardeth  beyond measure them that endure with patience.(64) Inhale then the sweet  savours of the spirit from the garment of hidden meanings, and say: \"O ye  that are immersed in the ocean of selflessness! Hasten to enter the City  of Immortality, if ye seek to ascend its heights.\" And We exclaim: \"Verily  we are God's, and to Him shall we return.\"(65)    105 From this most august and exalted station, and from this most sublime  and glorious plane, the seeker entereth the City of Immortality, therein  to abide forever. In this station he beholdeth himself established upon  the throne of independence and the seat of exaltation. Then will he  comprehend the meaning of that which hath been revealed of old concerning  the day \"whereon God shall enrich all through His abundance\".(66) Well is  it with them that have attained unto this station and drunk their fill  from this snow-white chalice before this Crimson Pillar.    106 Having, in this journey, immersed himself in the ocean of immortality,  rid his heart from attachment to aught save Him, and attained unto the  loftiest heights of everlasting life, the seeker will see no annihilation  either for himself or for any other soul. He will quaff from the cup of  immortality, tread in its land, soar in its atmosphere, consort with them  that are its embodiments, partake of the imperishable and incorruptible  fruits of the tree of eternity, and be forever accounted, in the lofty  heights of immortality, amongst the denizens of the everlasting realm.    107 All that existeth in this city shall indeed endure and will never  perish. Shouldst thou, by the leave of God, enter this sublime and exalted  garden, thou wouldst find its sun in its noontide glory, never to set,  never to be eclipsed. The same holdeth true of its moon, its firmament,  its stars, trees, and oceans, and of all that pertaineth thereunto or  existeth therein. By Him besides Whom there is none other God! Were I to  recount, from this day unto the end that hath no end, its wondrous  attributes, the love that My heart cherisheth for this hallowed and  everlasting city would never be exhausted. I shall, however, bring My  theme to a close, since time is short and the inquirer impatient, and  since these secrets are not to be openly divulged save by the leave of  God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling.    108 Erelong shall the faithful behold, in the day of the latter  Resurrection, Him Whom God shall make manifest descending with this city  from the heaven of the Unseen, together with a company of His exalted and  favoured angels. Great, therefore, is the blessedness of him that  attaineth unto His presence and beholdeth His countenance.

All his neighbors  were then under a legal duty to follow the trail of the cow to  its taker.    Murder is punished by death as follows: \"If any man break the  King's peace given by hand or seal, so that he slay the man to  whom the peace was given, both his life and lands shall be in the  King's power if he be taken, and if he cannot be taken he shall  be held an outlaw by all, and if anyone shall be able to slay  him he shall have his spoils by law.\"    \"If anyone by force break or enter any man's court or house to  slay or wound or assault a man, he shall pay 100 shillings to  the King as fine.\"    \"If anyone slay a man within his court or his house, himself and  all his substance are at the King's will, save the dower of his  wife if he have endowed her.\"    No clergy may gamble or participate in games of chance.    Measures and weights of goods for sale shall be correct.    Every man shall have a warrantor to his market transactions and  no one shall buy and sell except in a market town; but he shall  have the witness of the portreeve or of other men of credit, who  can be trusted.    No marketing, business, or hunting may be done on Sundays.    No one may bind a free man, shave his head in derision, or shave  off his beard. Shaving was a sign of enslavement, which could be  incurred by not paying one's fines for offenses committed.    \"And if anyone is so rich or belongs to so powerful a kindred,  that he cannot be restrained from crime or from protecting and  harboring criminals, he shall be led out of his native district  with his wife and children, and all his goods, to any part of  the kingdom which the King chooses, be he noble or commoner,  whoever he may be - with the provision that he shall never  return to his native district. And henceforth, let him never be  encountered by anyone in that district; otherwise he shall be  treated as a thief caught in the act.\"    The Laws for London were:    \"1. The gates called Aldersgate and Cripplegate were in charge of  guards.    2. If a small ship came to Billingsgate, one half-penny was paid  as toll; if a larger ship with sails, one penny was paid.      1) If a hulk or merchantman arrives and lies there, four pence  is paid as toll.      2) From a ship with a cargo of planks, one plank is given as  toll.      3) On three days of the week toll for cloth [is paid] on  Sunday and Tuesday and Thursday.      4) A merchant who came to the bridge with a boat containing  fish paid one half- penny as toll, and for a larger ship one  penny.\"      5 - 8) Foreigners with wine or blubber fish or other goods and  their tolls.    Foreigners were allowed to buy wool, melted fat [tallow], and  three live pigs for their ships.    \"3. If the town-reeve or the village reeve or any other official  accuses anyone of having withheld toll, and the man replies that  he has kept back no toll which it was his legal duty to pay, he  shall swear to this with six others and shall be quit of the  charge.      1) If he declares that he has paid toll, he shall produce the  man to whom he paid it, and shall be quit of the charge.      2) If, however, he cannot produce the man to whom he paid it,  he shall pay the actual toll and as much again and five pounds  to the King.      3) If he vouches the tax-gatherer to warranty [asserting]  that he paid toll to him, and the latter denies it, he shall  clear himself by the ordeal and by no other means of proof.    4. And we [the King and his counselors] have decreed that a man  who, within the town, makes forcible entry into another man's  house without permission and commits a breach of the peace of  the worst kind ... and he who assaults an innocent person on the  King's highway, if he is slain, shall lie in an unhonored grave.      1) If, before demanding justice, he has recourse to violence,  but does not lose his life thereby, he shall pay five pounds for  breach of the King's peace.      2) If he values the good-will of the town itself, he shall  pay us thirty shillings as compensation, if the King will grant  us this concession.\"    5. No base coin or coin defective in quality or weight, foreign  or English, may be used by a foreigner or an Englishman.    Swearing a false oath or perjury is punishable by loss of one's  hand or half one's wergeld.      Judicial Procedure    There were courts for different geographical communities.    In London, the Hustings Court met weekly and the folkmoot of all  citizens met three times a year. Each ward had a leet court  [precursor to police court].    The vill [similar to village] was the smallest community for  judicial purposes. There were several vills in a hundred.    A King's reeve presided over local criminal and peace and order  issues [leet jurisdiction] at monthly meetings of the hundred  court. However, summary procedure was followed when a criminal  was caught in the act or seized after a hue and cry. Every free  man over age 12 had to be in a hundred. The hundred was a  division of the shire [county]. Usually, the shire reeve, or  \"sheriff\", held each hundred court in turn. In the hundred  court, representatives of the villages settled their disputes  and answered for breaches of the peace.    A shire [county] was a larger area of land, headed by an earl.  All persons residing in the shire met twice a year. They were  summoned together by the sheriff, who was appointed by the earl  and the King. The sheriff was responsible for the royal  administration in the shire. He was responsible for the royal  accounts and performed functions like tracking cattle thieves.  The shire court was primarily concerned with issues of the  larger landholders. Here the freemen interpreted the customary  law of the locality. The earl usually took a third of the  profits such as fines and forfeits, of the shire court.    A bishop sat on both the shire and the hundred court.    \"No one shall make distraint of property until he has appealed  for justice in the hundred court and shire court\".    This lawsuit between a son and his mother over land was heard at  a shire- meeting: \"Here it is declared in this document that a  shire-meeting sat at Aylton in King Cnut's time. There were  present Bishop AEthelstan and Earl Ranig and Edwin, the Earl's  son, and Leofwine, Wulfsige's son, and Thurkil the White; and  Tofi the Proud came there on the King's business, and Bryning  the sheriff was present, and AEthelweard of Frome and Leofwine  of Frome and Godric of Stoke and all the thegns of  Herefordshire. Then Edwin, Enneawnes son, came traveling to the  meeting and sued his own mother for a certain piece of land,  namely Wellington and Cradley. Then the bishop asked whose  business it was to answer for his mother, and Thurkil the White  replied that it was his business to do so, if he knew the claim.  As he did not know the claim, three thegns were chosen from the  meeting [to ride] to the place where she was, namely at Fawley,  and these were Leofwine of Frome and AEthelsige the Red and  Winsige the seaman, and when they came to her they asked her  what claim she had to the lands for which her son was suing her.  Then she said that she had no land that in any way belonged to  him, and was strongly incensed against her son, and summoned to  her kinswoman, Leofflaed, Thurkil's wife, and in front of them  said to her as follows: 'Here sits Leofflaed, my kinswoman, to  whom, after my death, I grant my land and my gold, my clothing  and my raiment and all that I possess.' And then she said to the  thegns: 'Act like thegns, and duly announce my message to the  meeting before all the worthy men, and tell them to whom I have  granted my land and all my property, and not a thing to my own  son, and ask them to be witnesses of this.' And they did so;  they rode to the meeting and informed all the worthy men of the  charge that she had laid upon them. Then Thurkil the White stood  up in the meeting and asked all the thegns to give his wife the  lands unreservedly which her kinswoman had granted her, and they  did so. Then Thurkil rode to St. AEthelbert's minister, with the  consent and cognizance of the whole assembly, and had it  recorded in a gospel book.\"    Courts controlled by lords had various kinds of jurisdiction  recognized by the King. \"Sac and soc\" included the right to deal  with land disputes. \"Toll and team\" included the right to levy  tolls on cattle sales and to hold a hearing for men accused of  stealing cattle. \"Infangenetheof\" gave power to do justice to a  thief caught red-handed. Sometimes this jurisdiction overlapped  that of the hundred court.    The King decided the complaints and issues of the nobility.            Chapter 4    The Times: 1066-1100    William came from Normandy to conquer the nation. He claimed that  the former King, Edward, the Confessor, had promised the throne  to him when they were growing up together in Normandy if Edward  became King of England and had no children. William's men and  horses came in boats powered by oars and sails. The conquest did  not take long because of the superiority of his military  expertise to that of the English. He organized his army into  three groups: archers with bows and arrows, horsemen with swords  and stirrups, and footmen with hand weapons. Each group played a  specific role in a strategy planned in advance. The English army  was only composed of footmen with hand weapons and shields and  was inexperienced.    Declaring the English who fought against him to be traitors,  William declared their land confiscated. As William conquered  this land, he parceled it out among the barons who fought with  him. They again made oaths of personal loyalty to him [fealty].  They agreed to hold the land as his vassals with future military  services to him and receipt of his protection. They gave him  homage by placing their hands within his and saying "]]]
