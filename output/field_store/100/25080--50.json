I took with me a  favorite dog: an exceedingly sharp, bold, and vigilant bull  terrier,--a dog fond of prowling about strange, ghostly corners and  passages at night in search of rats; a dog of dogs for a ghost.    I reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened with a cheerful  smile.    We did not stay long in the drawing-rooms,--in fact, they felt so  damp and so chilly that I was glad to get to the fire upstairs.  We  locked the doors of the drawing-rooms,--a precaution which, I  should observe, we had taken with all the rooms we had searched  below.  The bedroom my servant had selected for me was the best on  the floor,--a large one, with two windows fronting the street.  The  four-posted bed, which took up no inconsiderable space, was  opposite to the fire, which burned clear and bright; a door in the  wall to the left, between the bed and the window, communicated with  the room which my servant appropriated to himself.  This last was a  small room with a sofa bed, and had no communication with the  landing place,--no other door but that which conducted to the  bedroom I was to occupy.  On either side of my fireplace was a  cupboard without locks, flush with the wall, and covered with the  same dull-brown paper.  We examined these cupboards,--only hooks to  suspend female dresses, nothing else; we sounded the walls,--  evidently solid, the outer walls of the building.  Having finished  the survey of these apartments, warmed myself a few moments, and  lighted my cigar, I then, still accompanied by F----, went forth to  complete my reconnoiter.  In the landing place there was another  door; it was closed firmly.  \"Sir,\" said my servant, in surprise,  \"I unlocked this door with all the others when I first came; it  cannot have got locked from the inside, for--\"    Before he had finished his sentence, the door, which neither of us  then was touching, opened quietly of itself.  We looked at each  other a single instant.  The same thought seized both,--some human  agency might be detected here.  I rushed in first, my servant  followed.  A small, blank, dreary room without furniture; a few  empty boxes and hampers in a corner; a small window; the shutters  closed; not even a fireplace; no other door but that by which we  had entered; no carpet on the floor, and the floor seemed very old,  uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and there, as was shown by the  whiter patches on the wood; but no living being, and no visible  place in which a living being could have hidden.  As we stood  gazing round, the door by which we had entered closed as quietly as  it had before opened; we were imprisoned.    For the first time I felt a creep of indefinable horror.  Not so my  servant.  \"Why, they don't think to trap us, sir; I could break  that trumpery door with a kick of my foot.\"    \"Try first if it will open to your hand,\" said I, shaking off the  vague apprehension that had seized me, \"while I unclose the  shutters and see what is without.\"    I unbarred the shutters,--the window looked on the little back yard  I have before described; there was no ledge without,--nothing to  break the sheer descent of the wall.  No man getting out of that  window would have found any footing till he had fallen on the  stones below.    F----, meanwhile, was vainly attempting to open the door.  He now  turned round to me and asked my permission to use force.  And I  should here state, in justice to the servant, that, far from  evincing any superstitious terrors, his nerve, composure, and even  gayety amidst circumstances so extraordinary, compelled my  admiration, and made me congratulate myself on having secured a  companion in every way fitted to the occasion.  I willingly gave  him the permission he required.  But though he was a remarkably  strong man, his force was as idle as his milder efforts; the door  did not even shake to his stoutest kick.  Breathless and panting,  he desisted.  I then tried the door myself, equally in vain.  As I  ceased from the effort, again that creep of horror came over me;  but this time it was more cold and stubborn.  I felt as if some  strange and ghastly exhalation were rising up from the chinks of  that rugged floor, and filling the atmosphere with a venomous  influence hostile to human life.  The door now very slowly and  quietly opened as of its own accord.  We precipitated ourselves  into the landing place.  We both saw a large, pale light--as large  as the human figure, but shapeless and unsubstantial--move before  us, and ascend the stairs that led from the landing into the  attics.  I followed the light, and my servant followed me.  It  entered, to the right of the landing, a small garret, of which the  door stood open.  I entered in the same instant.  The light then  collapsed into a small globule, exceedingly brilliant and vivid,  rested a moment on a bed in the corner, quivered, and vanished.  We  approached the bed and examined it,--a half-tester, such as is  commonly found in attics devoted to servants.  On the drawers that  stood near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief, with the  needle still left in a rent half repaired.  The kerchief was  covered with dust; probably it had belonged to the old woman who  had last died in that house, and this might have been her sleeping  room.  I had sufficient curiosity to open the drawers: there were a  few odds and ends of female dress, and two letters tied round with  a narrow ribbon of faded yellow.  I took the liberty to possess  myself of the letters.  We found nothing else in the room worth  noticing,--nor did the light reappear; but we distinctly heard, as  we turned to go, a pattering footfall on the floor, just before us.  We went through the other attics (in all four), the footfall still  preceding us.  Nothing to be seen,--nothing but the footfall heard.  I had the letters in my hand; just as I was descending the stairs I  distinctly felt my wrist seized, and a faint, soft effort made to  draw the letters from my clasp.  I only held them the more tightly,  and the effort ceased.    We regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself, and I then  remarked that my dog had not followed us when we had left it.  He  was thrusting himself close to the fire, and trembling.  I was  impatient to examine the letters; and while I read them, my servant  opened a little box in which he had deposited the weapons I had  ordered him to bring, took them out, placed them on a table close  at my bed head, and then occupied himself in soothing the dog, who,  however, seemed to heed him very little.    The letters were short,--they were dated; the dates exactly thirty-  five years ago.  They were evidently from a lover to his mistress,  or a husband to some young wife.  Not only the terms of expression,  but a distinct reference to a former voyage, indicated the writer  to have been a seafarer.  The spelling and handwriting were those  of a man imperfectly educated, but still the language itself was  forcible.  In the expressions of endearment there was a kind of  rough, wild love; but here and there were dark unintelligible hints  at some secret not of love,--some secret that seemed of crime.  \"We  ought to love each other,\" was one of the sentences I remember,  \"for how everyone else would execrate us if all was known.\"  Again:  \"Don't let anyone be in the same room with you at night,--you talk  in your sleep.\"  And again: \"What's done can't be undone; and I  tell you there's nothing against us unless the dead could come to  life.\"  Here there was underlined in a better handwriting (a  female's), \"They do!\"  At the end of the letter latest in date the  same female hand had written these words: \"Lost at sea the 4th of  June, the same day as--\"    I put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents.    Fearing, however, that the train of thought into which I fell might  unsteady my nerves, I fully determined to keep my mind in a fit  state to cope with whatever of marvelous the advancing night might  bring forth.  I roused myself; laid the letters on the table;  stirred up the fire, which was still bright and cheering; and  opened my volume of Macaulay.  I read quietly enough till about  half past eleven.  I then threw myself dressed upon the bed, and  told my servant he might retire to his own room, but must keep  himself awake.  I bade him leave open the door between the two  rooms.  Thus alone, I kept two candles burning on the table by my  bed head.  I placed my watch beside the weapons, and calmly resumed  my Macaulay.  Opposite to me the fire burned clear; and on the  hearth rug, seemingly asleep, lay the dog.  In about twenty minutes  I felt an exceedingly cold air pass by my cheek, like a sudden  draught.  I fancied the door to my right, communicating with the  landing place, must have got open; but no,--it was closed.  I then  turned my glance to my left, and saw the flame of the candles  violently swayed as by a wind.  At the same moment the watch beside  the revolver softly slid from the table,--softly, softly; no  visible hand,--it was gone.  I sprang up, seizing the revolver with  the one hand, the dagger with the other; I was not willing that my  weapons should share the fate of the watch.  Thus armed, I looked  round the floor,--no sign of the watch.  Three slow, loud, distinct  knocks were now heard at the bed head; my servant called out, \"Is  that you, sir?\"    \"No; be on your guard.\"    The dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his ears moving  quickly backward and forward.  He kept his eyes fixed on me with a  look so strange that he concentered all my attention on himself.  Slowly he rose up, all his hair bristling, and stood perfectly  rigid, and with the same wild stare.  I had no time, however, to  examine the dog.  Presently my servant emerged from his room; and  if ever I saw horror in the human face, it was then.

[Illustration: 1. THE CIGALE LAYING HER EGGS.    2. THE GREEN GRASSHOPPER, THE FALSE CIGALE OF THE NORTH, DEVOURING THE  TRUE CIGALE, A DWELLER IN THE SOUTH.]    This was instructive. The attack was delivered high up above my head, in  the early morning, while the Cigale was resting; and the struggles of  the unfortunate creature as it was dissected alive had resulted in the  fall of assailant and assailed together. Since then I have often been  the witness of similar assassinations.    I have even seen the grasshopper, full of audacity, launch itself in  pursuit of the Cigale, who fled in terror. So the sparrow-hawk pursues  the skylark in the open sky. But the bird of prey is less ferocious than  the insect; it pursues a creature smaller than itself. The locust, on  the contrary, assails a colossus, far larger and far more vigorous than  its enemy; yet the result is a foregone conclusion, in spite of this  disproportion. With its powerful mandibles, like pincers of steel, the  grasshopper rarely fails to eviscerate its captive, which, being  weaponless, can only shriek and struggle.    The Cigale is an easy prey during its hours of somnolence. Every Cigale  encountered by the ferocious grasshopper on its nocturnal round must  miserably perish. Thus are explained those sudden squeaks of anguish  which are sometimes heard in the boughs during the hours of the night  and early morning, although the cymbals have long been silent. The  sea-green bandit has fallen upon some slumbering Cigale. When I wished  to rear some green grasshoppers I had not far to seek for the diet of my  pensioners; I fed them on Cigales, of which enormous numbers were  consumed in my breeding-cages. It is therefore an established fact that  the green grasshopper, the false Cigale of the North, will eagerly  devour the true Cigale, the inhabitant of the Midi.    But it is neither the sparrow nor the green grasshopper that has forced  the Cigale to produce such a vast number of offspring. The real danger  is elsewhere, as we shall see. The risk is enormous at the moment of  hatching and also when the egg is laid.    Two or three weeks after its escape from the earth--that is, about the  middle of July--the Cigale begins to lay. In order to observe the  process without trusting too much to chance, I took certain precautions  which would, I felt sure, prove successful. The dry Asphodelus is the  support preferred by the insect, as previous observations had assured  me. It was also the plant which best lent itself to my experiments, on  account of its long, smooth stems. Now, during the first years of my  residence in the South I replaced the thistles in my paddock by other  native plants of a less stubborn and prickly species. Among the new  occupants was the asphodel. This was precisely what I needed for my  experiments. I left the dry stems of the preceding year in place, and  when the breeding season arrived I inspected them daily.    I had not long to wait. As early as July 15th I found as many Cigales as  I could wish on the stems of the asphodel, all in process of laying. The  gravid female is always solitary. Each mother has her twig to herself,  and is in no danger of being disturbed during the delicate operation of  laying. When the first occupant has departed another may take her place,  and so on indefinitely. There is abundance of room for all; but each  prefers to be alone as her turn arrives. There is, however, no  unpleasantness of any kind; everything passes most peacefully. If a  female Cigale finds a place which has been already taken she flies away  and seeks another twig directly she discovers her mistake.    The gravid female always retains an upright position at this time, as  indeed she does at other times. She is so absorbed in her task that she  may readily be watched, even through a magnifying glass. The ovipositor,  which is about four-tenths of an inch in length, is plunged obliquely  and up to the hilt into the twig. So perfect is the tool that the  operation is by no means troublesome. We see the Cigale tremble  slightly, dilating and contracting the extremity of the abdomen in  frequent palpitations. This is all that can be seen. The boring  instrument, consisting of a double saw, alternately rises and sinks in  the rind of the twig with a gentle, almost imperceptible movement.  Nothing in particular occurs during the process of laying the eggs. The  insect is motionless, and hardly ten minutes elapse between the first  cut of the ovipositor and the filling of the egg-chamber with eggs.    The ovipositor is then withdrawn with methodical deliberation, in order  that it may not be strained or bent. The egg-chamber closes of its own  accord as the woody fibres which have been displaced return to their  position, and the Cigale climbs a little higher, moving upwards in a  straight line, by about the length of its ovipositor. It then makes  another puncture and a fresh chamber for another ten or twelve eggs. In  this way it scales the twig from bottom to top.    These facts being understood, we are able to explain the remarkable  arrangement of the eggs. The openings in the rind of the twig are  practically equidistant, since each time the Cigale moves upward it is  by a given length, namely, that of the ovipositor. Very rapid in flight,  she is a very idle walker. At the most you may see her, on the living  twig from which she is drinking, moving at a slow, almost solemn pace,  to gain a more sunny point close at hand. On the dry twig in which she  deposits her eggs she observes the same formal habits, and even  exaggerates them, in view of the importance of the operation. She moves  as little as possible, just so far as she must in order to avoid running  two adjacent egg-chambers into one. The extent of each movement upwards  is approximately determined by the depth of the perforation.    The apertures are arranged in a straight line when their number is not  very large. Why, indeed, should the insect wander to right or to left  upon a twig which presents the same surface all over? A lover of the  sun, she chooses that side of the twig which is most exposed to it. So  long as she feels the heat, her supreme joy, upon her back, she will  take good care not to change the position which she finds so delightful  for another in which the sun would fall upon her less directly.    The process of depositing the eggs is a lengthy one when it is carried  out entirely on the same twig. Counting ten minutes for each  egg-chamber, the full series of forty would represent a period of six or  seven hours. The sun will of course move through a considerable distance  before the Cigale can finish her work. In such cases the series of  apertures follows a spiral curve. The insect turns round the stalk as  the sun turns.    Very often as the Cigale is absorbed in her maternal task a diminutive  fly, also full of eggs, busily exterminates the Cigale's eggs as fast as  they are laid.    This insect was known to Reaumur. In nearly all the twigs examined he  found its grub, the cause of a misunderstanding at the beginning of his  researches. But he did not, could not see the audacious insect at work.  It is one of the Chalcididae, about one-fifth or one-sixth of an inch in  length; entirely black, with knotty antennae, which are slightly thicker  towards their extremities. The unsheathed ovipositor is implanted in the  under portion of the abdomen, about the middle, and at right angles to  the axis of the body, as in the case of the Leucospis, the pest of the  apiary. Not having taken the precaution to capture it, I do not know  what name the entomologists have bestowed upon it, or even if this dwarf  exterminator of the Cigale has as yet been catalogued. What I am  familiar with is its calm temerity, its impudent audacity in the  presence of the colossus who could crush it with a foot. I have seen as  many as three at once exploiting the unfortunate female. They keep close  behind the Cigale, working busily with their probes, or waiting until  their victim deposits her eggs.    The Cigale fills one of her egg-chambers and climbs a little higher in  order to bore another hole. One of the bandits runs to the abandoned  station, and there, almost under the claws of the giant, and without the  least nervousness, as if it were accomplishing some meritorious action,  it unsheathes its probe and thrusts it into the column of eggs, not by  the open aperture, which is bristling with broken fibres, but by a  lateral fissure. The probes works slowly, as the wood is almost intact.  The Cigale has time to fill the adjacent chamber.    As soon as she has finished one of these midges, the very same that has  been performing its task below her, replaces her and introduces its  disastrous egg. By the time the Cigale departs, her ovaries empty, the  majority of the egg-chambers have thus received the alien egg which will  work the destruction of their contents. A small, quick-hatching grub,  richly nourished on a dozen eggs, will replace the family of the Cigale.    The experience of centuries has taught the Cigale nothing. With her  excellent eyesight she must be able to perceive these terrible sappers  as they hover about her, meditating their crime. Too peaceable giantess!  if you see them why do you not seize them in your talons, crush the  pigmies at their work, so that you may proceed with your travail in  security? But no, you will leave them untouched; you cannot modify your  instincts, even to alleviate your maternal misfortunes.    The eggs of the common Cigale are of a shining ivory white. Conical at  the ends, and elongated in form, they might be compared in shape to the  weaver's shuttle. Their length is about one-tenth of an inch, their  diameter about one-fiftieth. They are packed in a row, slightly  overlapping one another. The eggs of the Cacan are slightly "]]]
