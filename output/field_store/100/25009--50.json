I have described this action more in detail because we have in it  whatever distinction in the manner of cutting the lines of the field  is to be found between wire on smooth armatures and on projection  armatures and modifications thereof; and also between flat, open coils  passing through a field and bobbins with cores of iron. The  considerations advanced also bring out the relation which exists  between closed iron circuit transformers and closed iron circuit  (projection) dynamos, as we may call them.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    I had intended at the outset of this paper to deal to some extent with  the propagation of lines of magnetism undergoing retardation in  reference to alternating current motor devices, transformers with  limited secondary current, or constant average current, an alternating  motor working with what I may term a translation lag, etc.; but it was  soon found that these matters must remain over for a continuation of  this paper at some future time. My endeavor has been in the present  paper to deal with the lines of force theory as though it were a  symbol of the reality, but I confess that it is done with many  misgivings that I may have carried it too far. Yet, if we are to use  the idea at all it has seemed but right to apply it wherever it may  throw any light on the subject or assist in our understanding of  phenomena.           *       *       *       *       *          ELECTRIC LIGHTING AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION--THE OERLIKON  WORKS.      Immediately on entering the Machinery Hall by the _galerie_ leading  from the central dome, and occupying a prominent position at the  commencement of the Swiss section, is a very important plant of  dynamos, motors, and steam engines, put down by the Oerlikon Works, of  Zurich. During the time the machinery is kept running in the hall,  power is supplied electrically to drive the whole of the main shafting  in the Swiss section and part of that in the Belgian section,  amounting in all to some 200 ft., a large number of machines of  various industries deriving their power from these lines of shafting,  while during the evening a portion of the upper and lower galleries  adjoining this section is lit by some twenty-five arc lamps run from  this exhibit. Steam is supplied from the Roser boilers in the motive  power court. The whole of the generating plant is illustrated in one  view, and a separate view is given of the motor employed to drive the  main shafting, this latter view showing the details of connection to  the same. On the extreme right hand side of the first view is a direct  coupled engine and dynamo of 20 horse power, a separate cut of which  is given in Fig. 3. The engine is of the vertical single cylinder  type, standing 5 ft. high, and fitted, as are the other two engines  exhibited, with centrifugal governor gear on the fly wheel, acting  directly on the throw of the cutoff valve eccentric. The two  standards, supporting the cylinder and forming the guide bars,  together with the entire field magnets and pole pieces of the dynamo,  and the bed plate common to both, are cast in one piece.    [Illustration: FIG. 3 ENGINE AND DYNAMO FOR STEAMSHIPS.]    The machine is specially designed for ship lighting, and with the view  of preventing any magnetic effect upon the ship's compass, the field  is arranged so that the armature, pole pieces, and coils are entirely  inclosed by iron. Any tendency to leakage of magnetic lines will  therefore be within the machine, the iron acting as a shield. This  build of field--shown in Fig. 3A--is also advantageous as a mechanical  shield to the parts of the machine most likely to suffer from rough  handling in transport, and it will be seen that the field coils are  easily slipped on before the armature is mounted in its bearings.    [Illustration: FIG. 3A]    The winding is compound, and in such a direction that the two opposite  horizontal poles have the same polarity; it follows from this that  there will be two consequent poles in the iron, these being opposite  in name to the horizontal poles and at right angles to them, viz.,  above and below the armature. Opposite sections of the commutator are  connected together internally as in most four-pole machines, so that  only two brushes are necessary, at 90 deg. apart.    The section of iron in the field is 60 square inches and rectangular  in form, and the whole machine measures 4 ft. 3 in. in length, and 2  ft. in height, without including the height of the bed plate. The  armature is 17 in. in length and the same in diameter, measured over  the winding, and develops at the machine terminals 70 volts and 200  amperes at 480 revolutions. The moving parts of the engine are well  balanced, and run remarkably well and without noise at this high rate  of speed.    This dynamo serves to develop power to run a motor in an adjoining  inclosure, containing some fine specimens of lathes and machine tools  constructed by the Oerlikon Works. These are driven by the motor  through the medium of a countershaft, and the power and speed are  controlled from the switch board seen at the left of the exhibit, and  in Fig. 11. The resistance, R1, serves to vary the intensity of the  shunt field of the dynamo, the volts being indicated by the voltmeter  V1, and a resistance separate from the switch board is inserted in  the main circuit of the two machines. The ammeter, A2, is directly  connected to the dynamo, and therefore indicates the current, whatever  circuit this machine is running.    [Illustration: Figs. 5-9, 11 plus THE PARIS EXHIBITION--STAND OF THE  OERLIKON WORKS.]    A larger combined engine and dynamo, seen in the center of the stand,  serves to run the lighting of the galleries. The engine is a 60 horse  power compound, running at 350 revolutions, and fitted with a governor  on the fly wheel, like that described above.    The dynamo is a two-pole machine, the upper pole and yoke being cast  in one, and the lower pole, yoke, and combined bed plate forming a  separate casting. The two vertical cores, over which the field bobbins  are slipped, are of wrought iron, and are turned with a shoulder at  either end, the yokes being recessed to fit them exactly. The cores  are then bolted to the yokes vertically from the top and horizontally  below. The field of this machine is shunt-wound, and in order to  maintain the potential constant a hand-regulated resistance--R2 on  the switch board--is added in circuit with the shunt field. The  voltmeter, V2, immediately above this resistance, serves to  indicate the difference of potential at the machine terminals. Both  voltmeters are fitted with keys, so that they are only put in circuit  when the readings are taken.    The main terminals of this machine are fitted on substantial  insulating bases, fixed one at each end of the top yoke. These connect  to the external circuit by a heavy cable--the machine being capable of  developing 500 amperes--and to the shunt circuit, and regulating  resistance by small wires; while the two connections to the brushes  are by four covered wires in parallel on each side. This mode of  connection is more flexible than a short length of heavy cable, and  looks well, the wires being held neatly together by vulcanized fiber  bridges. The dynamo is a low tension machine, the field being  regulated to give 65 volts when running the lamp circuits.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    The illustration, Fig. 10, represents the automatic  re-regulator--C.E.L. Brown's patent. Motion is imparted to the cores  of two electro-magnets at the ends by the pulleys, W W1. The cores  have a projection opposite to the spindle, ab, which latter is  screw-threaded. By a relay one or other electro-magnet is put in  action, and the rotating core, which is magnetized, causes rotation of  the spindle by attraction, resulting in the movement of the contact  along the resistance stops. The relay is acted upon directly by the  potential of the dynamo, and the variable resistance is included in  the shunt field of the machine, so that changes in the potential,  resulting from changes in load or speed, are compensated for.    The arrangements of the lamp circuits and the lamp itself may now be  described. The lamps are all run in parallel circuit, but are divided  into groups of five, each group being controlled by a separate switch  on the board--Figs. 11 and 11A. These switches are not in  direct communication with the dynamo, but make that connection through  a large central switch, S2, which therefore carries the whole  current. The returns from each group are brought to the connections  seen between the two resistances, where the circuits may be  disconnected if desired, and the main current then passes through the  ammeter, A3, to the other terminal of the machine. One of the smaller  switches at the top, Fig. 11A, is directly connected with one terminal  of the 20 horse power dynamo before mentioned, and the other side of  the switch to the motor in the machine tool exhibit. Also one of the  switches in connection with the central switch, S2, is connected to  the same motor, and therefore the latter may be run by either machine,  or, in fact, any combination of machines, lamps, and motor be made as  required.    The form of switch made by the Oerlikon Works is illustrated in Fig.  7. Two thick semicircular bands of copper are screwed at one end to  opposite sides of a square block which is turned round by the switch  handle. The block has a projection at each corner, and two strong,  flat, stationary springs are attached to the framework of the switch  and press on opposite sides of the block. The ends of the springs  engage in the projections and prevent the switch being turned round  the wrong way, while the pressure of the springs on opposite "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#9)"],[1,"and conceit.  From the sayings of those Masters of holy utterance, Who have expounded  the meaning of true knowledge, the odour of these dark teachings, which  have obscured the world, can in no wise be detected. The tree of such  teachings can yield no result except iniquity and rebellion, and beareth  no fruit but hatred and envy. Its fruit is deadly poison; its shadow a  consuming fire. How well hath it been said: \"Cling unto the robe of the  Desire of thy heart, and put thou away all shame; bid the worldlywise be  gone, however great their name.\"    The heart must needs therefore be cleansed from the idle sayings of men,  and sanctified from every earthly affection, so that it may discover the  hidden meaning of divine inspiration, and become the treasury of the  mysteries of divine knowledge. Thus hath it been said: \"He that treadeth  the snow-white Path, and followeth in the footsteps of the Crimson Pillar,  shall never attain unto his abode unless his hands are empty of those  worldly things cherished by men.\" This is the prime requisite of whosoever  treadeth this path. Ponder thereon, that, with eyes unveiled, thou mayest  perceive the truth of these words.    We have digressed from the purpose of Our argument, although whatsoever is  mentioned serveth only to confirm Our purpose. By God! however great Our  desire to be brief, yet We feel We cannot restrain Our pen.  Notwithstanding all that We have mentioned, how innumerable are the pearls  which have remained unpierced in the shell of Our heart! How many the  huris of inner meaning that are as yet concealed within the chambers of  divine wisdom! None hath yet approached them;--huris, \"whom no man nor  spirit hath touched before.\"(55) Notwithstanding all that hath been said,  it seemeth as if not one letter of Our purpose hath been uttered, nor a  single sign divulged concerning Our object. When will a faithful seeker be  found who will don the garb of pilgrimage, attain the Ka'bih of the  heart's desire, and, without ear or tongue, discover the mysteries of  divine utterance?    By these luminous, these conclusive, and lucid statements, the meaning of  \"heaven\" in the aforementioned verse hath thus been made clear and  evident. And now regarding His words, that the Son of man shall \"come in  the clouds of heaven.\" By the term \"clouds\" is meant those things that are  contrary to the ways and desires of men. Even as He hath revealed in the  verse already quoted: \"As oft as an Apostle cometh unto you with that  which your souls desire not, ye swell with pride, accusing some of being  impostors and slaying others.\"(56) These \"clouds\" signify, in one sense,  the annulment of laws, the abrogation of former Dispensations, the repeal  of rituals and customs current amongst men, the exalting of the illiterate  faithful above the learned opposers of the Faith. In another sense, they  mean the appearance of that immortal Beauty in the image of mortal man,  with such human limitations as eating and drinking, poverty and riches,  glory and abasement, sleeping and waking, and such other things as cast  doubt in the minds of men, and cause them to turn away. All such veils are  symbolically referred to as \"clouds.\"    These are the \"clouds\" that cause the heavens of the knowledge and  understanding of all that dwell on earth to be cloven asunder. Even as He  hath revealed: \"On that day shall the heaven be cloven by the clouds.\"(57)  Even as the clouds prevent the eyes of men from beholding the sun, so do  these things hinder the souls of men from recognizing the light of the  divine Luminary. To this beareth witness that which hath proceeded out of  the mouth of the unbelievers as revealed in the sacred Book: \"And they  have said: 'What manner of apostle is this? He eateth food, and walketh  the streets. Unless an angel be sent down and take part in His warnings,  we will not believe.'\"(58) Other Prophets, similarly, have been subject to  poverty and afflictions, to hunger, and to the ills and chances of this  world. As these holy Persons were subject to such needs and wants, the  people were, consequently, lost in the wilds of misgivings and doubts, and  were afflicted with bewilderment and perplexity. How, they wondered, could  such a person be sent down from God, assert His ascendancy over all the  peoples and kindreds of the earth, and claim Himself to be the goal of all  creation,--even as He hath said: \"But for Thee, I would not have created  all that are in heaven and on earth,\"--and yet be subject to such trivial  things? You must undoubtedly have been informed of the tribulations, the  poverty, the ills, and the degradation that have befallen every Prophet of  God and His companions. You must have heard how the heads of their  followers were sent as presents unto different cities, how grievously they  were hindered from that whereunto they were commanded. Each and every one  of them fell a prey to the hands of the enemies of His Cause, and had to  suffer whatsoever they decreed.    It is evident that the changes brought about in every Dispensation  constitute the dark clouds that intervene between the eye of man's  understanding and the divine Luminary which shineth forth from the  dayspring of the divine Essence. Consider how men for generations have  been blindly imitating their fathers, and have been trained according to  such ways and manners as have been laid down by the dictates of their  Faith. Were these men, therefore, to discover suddenly that a Man, Who  hath been living in their midst, Who, with respect to every human  limitation, hath been their equal, had risen to abolish every established  principle imposed by their Faith--principles by which for centuries they  have been disciplined, and every opposer and denier of which they have  come to regard as infidel, profligate and wicked,--they would of a  certainty be veiled and hindered from acknowledging His truth. Such things  are as \"clouds\" that veil the eyes of those whose inner being hath not  tasted the Salsabil of detachment, nor drunk from the Kawthar of the  knowledge of God. Such men, when acquainted with these circumstances,  become so veiled that without the least question, they pronounce the  Manifestation of God an infidel, and sentence Him to death. You must have  heard of such things taking place all down the ages, and are now observing  them in these days.    It behooveth us, therefore, to make the utmost endeavour, that, by God's  invisible assistance, these dark veils, these clouds of Heaven-sent  trials, may not hinder us from beholding the beauty of His shining  Countenance, and that we may recognize Him only by His own Self. And  should we ask for a testimony of His truth, we should content ourselves  with one, and only one; that thereby we may attain unto Him Who is the  Fountain-head of infinite grace, and in Whose presence all the world's  abundance fadeth into nothingness, that we may cease to cavil at Him every  day and to cleave unto our own idle fancy.    Gracious God! Notwithstanding the warning which, in marvelously symbolic  language and subtle allusions, hath been uttered in days past, and which  was intended to awaken the peoples of the world and to prevent them from  being deprived of their share of the billowing ocean of God's grace, yet  such things as have already been witnessed have come to pass! Reference to  these things hath also been made in the Qur'an, as witnessed by this  verse: \"What can such expect but that God should come down to them  overshadowed with clouds?\"(59) A number of the divines, who hold firmly to  the letter of the Word of God, have come to regard this verse as one of  the signs of that expected resurrection which is born of their idle fancy.  This, notwithstanding the fact that similar references have been made in  most of the heavenly Books, and have been recorded in all the passages  connected with the signs of the coming Manifestation.    Likewise, He saith: \"On the day when the heaven shall give out a palpable  smoke, which shall enshroud mankind: this will be an afflictive  torment.\"(60) The All-Glorious hath decreed these very things, that are  contrary to the desires of wicked men, to be the touchstone and standard  whereby He proveth His servants, that the just may be known from the  wicked, and the faithful distinguished from the infidel. The symbolic term  \"smoke\" denotes grave dissensions, the abrogation and demolition of  recognized standards, and the utter destruction of their narrow-minded  exponents. What smoke more dense and overpowering than the one which hath  now enshrouded all the peoples of the world, which hath become a torment  unto them, and from which they hopelessly fail to deliver themselves,  however much they strive? So fierce is this fire of self burning within  them, that at every moment they seem to be afflicted with fresh torments.  The more they are told that this wondrous Cause of God, this Revelation  from the Most High, hath been made manifest to all mankind, and is waxing  greater and stronger every day, the fiercer groweth the blaze of the fire  in their hearts. The more they observe the indomitable strength, the  sublime renunciation, the unwavering constancy of God's holy companions,  who, by the aid of God, are growing nobler and more glorious every day,  the deeper the dismay which ravageth their souls. In these days, praise be  to God, the power of His Word hath obtained such ascendancy over men, that  they dare breathe no word. Were they to encounter one of the companions of  God who, if he could, would, freely and joyously, offer up ten thousand  lives as a sacrifice for his Beloved, so great would be their fear, that  they forthwith would profess their faith in Him, whilst privily they would  vilify and execrate His name! Even as He hath revealed: \"And when they  meet you, they say, 'We believe'; but when they are apart, they bite their  fingers' ends at you, out of wrath. Say: '"]]]
