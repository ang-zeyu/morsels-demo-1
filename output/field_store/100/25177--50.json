The second bag is 22 inches long and 16 deep.  The web is of bast, the woof of hemp. The smaller specimen is 14 by 9  inches and is made exclusively of hemp, and is thus much more pliable  than the others. The small remnant of a larger bag shows a web of heavy,  plaited bast strands resembling the specimen impressed on pottery and  shown in _a_, plate IX. Besides these pieces there is a bit of heavy,  compactly woven stuff, resembling the broad part of a sling, which shows  traces of a geometric pattern, and a piece of flattish rope 12 feet long  and 12 inches broad plaited very neatly of hempen twine.    Among a number of cave relics from Kentucky donated to the Museum by Mr.  Francis Klett, are some textile articles. Among these is a sandal or  moccasin woven or plaited very neatly of bast. It is shown in figure 9.  Prof. F. W. Putnam and other explorers of these caves have obtained  numerous textile articles of interest.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. V FRAYED  BAG AND SKEINS OF HEMP FIBER.]    CHARRED REMAINS OF FABRICS FROM MOUNDS.    That the well-preserved fabrics just illustrated represent fairly the  textile work of the mound-builders is practically demonstrated by the  evidence furnished by the mounds themselves. From hundreds of sources  come the same story; and it is not necessary here to enter into any  elaborate discussion of the subject or to multiply illustrations. I  present in plates VI and VII specimens of mound fabrics which, since  they were burned with the dead, undoubtedly formed part of the clothing  of the living or were wrappings of articles deposited with the bodies.  These coarse cloths may be considered as fairly representing the weaving  of the mound-builders. There are among them some finer examples of  weaving than those obtained from the caves and shelters of Tennessee and  Kentucky, but there is nothing specifically different in material or  methods of combination, and there is nothing whatever to suggest a  higher stage of culture than that of the historic Indian.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Sandal or moccasin from a Kentucky cave.]    The fiber is quite fine and is more probably of hemp than of the bark of  trees. The strands are generally well twisted and even, the twist being  in most cases to the right, or as if twisted on the thigh with a  downward movement of the right-hand, the thread being held in the left.  As in the case of cave fabrics as well as the work of the modern peoples  of the region, the weaving is nearly all in the twined style, of which  there are two varieties; one in which each strand of the web is in turn  inclosed simply by the woof twisted in pairs, and the other in which  alternate pairs of the web strands are inclosed by the twined pairs of  the woof. Cloths woven in the first method are often quite close, as the  woof threads are readily pressed or pounded down on one another entirely  hiding the web strands, giving a fabric of much compactness and  strength. The second variety is usually somewhat open and net-like, and  very often the pairs of twined woof strands are placed far apart, as  shown in several of the illustrations given in this paper. The finest  mesh observed is in the first of these styles, and includes about twenty  intersections to the inch.    From the Ohio mounds also there are examples of plain as well as of  diagonal interlacing. In appearance the cloth is much the same as that  done in the twined style. In a few cases a border or selvage of very  simple construction is seen. A looped margin for the passage of a  gathering cord is common.    In plate VI a number of bits of charred cloth are shown; being quite  black the camera fails to give them with clearness, but the drawings  presented in plate VII serve to make clear all details of the strands  and their combination. The charring has taken place in cremating the  dead, in the burning of offerings or through accidental subjection to  heat. In some cases very considerable portions of the cloth are found,  but it is usually in a very fragile state and little has been preserved.    Specimens preserved in this way are obtained from a large area,  including the Ohio and a large portion of the Mississippi valleys.      FABRICS PRESERVED BY CONTACT WITH COPPER.    The preservation of woven textures through association in burials with  implements or other articles of copper is of common occurrence. Our  museums contain many examples of copper celts retaining on their  surfaces portions of cloth so well preserved that the fibers retain much  of their original strength as well as color. In plate VIII three  examples are shown from a mound near Davenport, Iowa, and a fourth from  a mound near Savannah, Georgia. The fabrics on _a_ and _b_ are of the  twined style and, although occurring 800 miles apart, are identical in  every respect. The cloth on _c_ is very closely woven and has the  appearance of simple interlacing. The finest piece of work that has come  to my notice is a bit of cloth from a mound in Pike county, Ohio. It has  from thirty-five to forty strands to the inch, and looks much like  coarse twilled goods. It is woven in the twined style, however, and is  therefore of native origin. It was preserved by contact with a large  number of copper beads, four of which are shown in the cut, figure 10.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Fine, closely woven cloth preserved by contact  with copper beads.]    Traces of basketry are rarely preserved either by charring or by contact  with copper. Matting is occasionally preserved in these ways. Figure 11  illustrates a piece of rush matting found fixed to the surface of a bit  of copper in a mound near Augusta, Georgia.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. VI  CHARRED CLOTH FROM MOUNDS IN OHIO.]    The weaving of the hair of many species of quadrupeds, the buffalo, the  opossum, the rabbit, etc., is noted by a number of authors, and a few  specimens of haircloth have been recovered from mounds. Mr. Henry R.  Howland found in a mound near Alton, Illinois, two varieties of cloth  preserved by contact with a copper ornament representing a  turtle-shell; they are described as follows:        Closely fitting over the outer surface of the copper shell      is, first, a woven cloth of a vegetable fibre, similar in its      general character to the outer matting above described, but      of a stronger and better preserved fibre, apparently more      like that which forms the woven coating of the Davenport      axes. This is covered in turn with a softer, finer fabric,      now of a dark-brown color, formed of twisted strands, laid or      matted closely together, though apparently not woven. The      material of which these strands are formed proves, under      microscopic examination, to be animal hair.[56]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Small portion of rush matting preserved by  contact with copper.]    An illustration of ancient split cane matting is presented in figure 12.  The specimen was obtained from Petite Anse island, near Vermilion bay,  southern coast of Louisiana, and a photograph was presented to the  Smithsonian Institution in 1866, by J. F. Cleu. The following  description, as given by Prof. Joseph Henry, appears on the label  attached to the specimen:        This fragment of matting was found near the surface of the      salt, and about 2 feet above it were remains of tusks and      bones of a fossil elephant. The peculiar interest in regard      to the specimen is in its occurrence in situ 2 feet below the      elephant remains, and about 14 feet below the surface of the      soil, thus showing the existence of mart on the island prior      to the deposit in the soil of the fossil elephant. The      material consists of the outer bark of the common southern      cane (_Arundinaria macrosperma_), and has been preserved for      so long a period both by its silicious character and the      strongly saline condition of the soil.      FABRICS IMPRESSED ON POTTERY.    It was a common practice among the aborigines to employ woven fabrics in  the construction and ornamentation of earthenware. Impressions were thus  left on the clay, and by baking these were rendered as lasting as if  engraved on stone.    From no other source do we obtain so wide a range of fabrics. The  fabric-marked vases and sherds are obtained from mounds, graves, and  village sites all over the country. There is not a state within the  Mississippi or Atlantic drainage that does not furnish some example of  the preservation of native fabric impressions on earthenware. The  perfection with which every character of these textures is preserved is  well shown in a number of the figures here introduced.    A somewhat extended study of this subject was published in the Third  Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, and illustrations of nearly  all the styles of weaving were given. As indicated by subsequent  investigations, a number of slight inaccuracies of analysis and drawing  occur in that paper, but they are of such minor importance that detailed  correction is unnecessary.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Split-cane matting from Petite Anse island,  Louisiana.]    It would seem that imprints of cloth woven in the plain interlaced style  appear to be quite rare, although it is difficult, from the impressions  on clay, to distinguish this from other forms when the threads are  closely impacted. In somewhat rare cases the interlacing is so arranged  and alternated as to give diagonal effects as in a specimen shown in  figure 13. These effects are peculiar to the interlaced fabrics, not  being produced in twined or netted work.    It has been supposed that vessels of clay were often modeled in baskets,  and that the native earthenware preserved numerous impressions of  baskets.

Anderson had to be contented with Gard's description of them, after  the latter had passed the cigars.    \"Who's the spy in your family?\" abruptly asked the elder.    \"The spy?\"    \"Yes, the spy. Every well-regulated German family should have a spy  in it.\"    \"What for?\" queried Kirtley in surprise.    \"Why, for the Kaiser, of course. Who else? The Teutons call him  euphemistically the Government. But without Wilhelm there wouldn't  be any German Government.\"    \"Why should he want spies in his own German families?\" interrogated  Gard innocently.    \"Didn't every medieval feudal lord keep close tab on his  subjects--the people he owned? The Kaiser wants to know of any signs  of disloyalty. If a household harbors any foreigners, as your family  is doing, he wants to know what they are up to.\"    \"Do you mean to say that the Government knows about me--that I'm  being watched?\"    \"They are at least ready to watch you. Mind you, Germany is a real  block-house, and the elaborate spy system is an integral part of it.  I should say, from what you tell me of the Buchers, that young  Rudolph is the sleuth here.\"    \"Rudolph?\"    \"Yes. He's doubtless keeping an eye on you and reporting to the  authorities if there's anything suspicious about you and your  actions.\"    And then the journalist, pleased to have a fresh listener, launched  upon his pet idea.    \"The Kaiser is preparing an abysmal pitfall for the world and it  won't take heed. I tell you, Kirtley--and I want you to mark my  words--Deutschland is going to spring at Europe like a tiger. The  army and navy are ready for the onslaught. When they spring, it will  be farewell to civilization--except the German--unless something  like a miracle supervenes. The French army is being moth-eaten by  the Socialists, the British navy has dry rot. I look to see Wilhelm  practically the ruler of the earth. If not, he will cause it to pay  a cost that will make the next fifty years groggy.\"    Kirtley thought this was jesting. He later learned that the \"old  man\" was regarded as \"cracked\" on this topic. Every spring he  prophesied war, but it had not come. The Kaiser failed to rush to  Paris and there dictate terms to an astounded and cowed universe.  People politely laughed in their sleeves. Yes, Anderson was a fine  fellow, but they wearied of his dismal forebodings that came to  naught. Some said it was because German had been hard for him to  learn. He had taken it up when more than fifty and had become  tangled in its snarling roots--its beer-drunken syntax. \"He had got  mad at the language.\" It was natural that he should get mad at the  people.    Gard saw a light.    \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"that's what the Buchers really mean about the  German army conquering everybody whenever it wants to.\"    \"That's it, that's it!\" Anderson was gratified by the confirmation.  He went on with grave seriousness.    \"I'm a journalist. I have opportunities to see behind the curtain,  haven't I? I have been at the army maneuvers, at the officers'  messes and dinners, when they were sober and when they were drunk.  Beer loosened their tongues and they did not care. They talk of it,  boast of it, and the civilian, too. I'm telling no secrets. They are  very frank about it. Don't you hear the Buchers openly discussing  it? They all give us warning and we say it's a fine day. Did you  ever read any of the Kaiser's speeches in German? There you find it  all. But he's crazy, they say. Crazy or not, he has the most  thoroughly organized and powerful nation behind him that the globe  ever saw. And behind him to a man.\"    \"Why don't you write it up, then--tell people over home?\" Gard  ventured, somewhat impressed.    \"Write it up? Tell people? That's what I _have_ been doing for five  years. But what's the use of shouting to a world of fools? No one  will pay any attention to it. My paper sends my stuff back and says  it don't want war talk--it wants peace talk. Americans are happy and  they don't want to be disturbed. They only want to hear about what  they want to believe. So it seems to be everywhere.\"    \"I guess you are right about that,\" Gard testified. \"I have been a  pretty fair reader of our papers and periodicals and have never been  made to feel there was any need for alarm.\"    \"Exactly,\" Anderson scolded. \"Why, look at our Exchange professors.  They are coming over here, ready to swallow the Germans whole. The  Kaiser invites them to lunch on his yacht, gives them a pat on the  shoulder blade, and they are his. While the Germans plainly despise  us, our educators go home crying Great is Germany! How superior are  her people! Let us send our sons over there to drink of her wisdom  and grandeur! What inanity! Bah!\"    \"And so here I am,\" Gard smiled. \"But I have bunted into you almost  the first thing.\"    \"Couldn't do better--couldn't do better,\" repeated Anderson with a  cheering turn. \"I'll tell you what to do. I'll give you a little  practical advice--free.\"    \"It won't be worth much if it's free, will it?\"    \"Well, it's worth this rotten German cigar you've given me. Read the  editorials and correspondence in the Dresden papers. They're a good  sample. There you'll see what the German attitude toward us is  officially, and what German hatred feeds on day by day. The trouble  with Americans over here is they don't read anything serious. Of  course our students study their text books. But generally our people  just fly around, hear music, drink beer in the cafes, but they don't  read. Too nervous--afraid of being bored. So they don't learn much.\"    Anderson ran on into other subjects.    \"One great thing about the German system is that it would make such  people work to some purpose. We don't. It also makes its plodders  work. This Government recognizes frankly that most of its  population, like all populations, are plodders, and it gives them  something regularly to do and sees that they do it. This converts  this dull element into an organized strength--a source of power. The  Germans practice their wonderful economies with respect to the  poorest kind of human energy. They kick something into their drones.  So they are such a mighty nation in a small land.    \"In America, in other countries, this element is rather a  disorganized weakness. It is not pushed. It is for the most part  waste material or neglected material. Our public system, when  economies are concerned, first considers money, property. It seems  sometimes as if our free individualistic plan of government were,  after all, adapted for the minority of the bright-witted.\"          CHAPTER XI    GERMAN WAYS      \"Had the Buchers ever known an American before you came?\" Anderson  interrupted himself.    \"No.\"    \"How do you think they like you?\"    \"I guess if I dropped out of their lives, I would not create much of  a splash.\"    \"You'll find they hate you. Hate is the German religion. The Germans  can hate people they've never known, never seen. They hate on  principle and without principle. Of course it's the proper precursor  for their programme of conquering the world. If they were trying to  love the world, they could not be preparing to demolish it and  expecting to.\"    Though Anderson had lived so long among the Teutons, he had not  become Teutonized. He was a marked exception. He viewed the nation  with a metallic aplomb that at times sent shivers down Kirtley's  spine.    \"Now this family of yours,\" he went on discursively--\"don't you  notice about them and in them and behind them something tremendously  unifying and propelling that is lacking in our American home?\"    \"I certainly do,\" responded Gard. \"I can't make it out--their  dynamic, conscientious industry. What is it for? It's not with the  idea of making money--like Americans, eager to accumulate the  dollars. It's not for personal fame. It's not for any ambitious  social position. It does not seem to be for any of the reasons that  inspire an American household. And yet it is here, in this house, in  every room, behind every chair at table, night and morning. It's  bigger than anything we find in our Yankee life because it's beyond  and higher than mere individuality. It makes the Buchers satisfied  and still is something that has fearfulness lurking about it. It's  not religious or divine--they are not actuated by such motives, do  not speak of them. What in the world is it that the Germans have  that is so wonderful and we do not seem to have?\"    Kirtley had thought a great deal about this and talked almost  fluently.    \"I'll tell you,\" and the old correspondent, bent forward toward him  earnestly, glad that he had a young, receptive mind opened out  toward him. \"I'll tell you. It's simply the Hohenzollern in his mad  and unconcealed pride about ruling the universe. He is in every  German home like this, driving each individual to work the best, to  make the most of himself and of herself, and without loss of time.  He makes them understand that it's for the great German race--that  they may become the potent force everywhere--leaders of mankind as  he has taught them they deserve to be. It is for the benefit of  their more and more deserving nation. But it is first and foremost  for himself and his family. He has a burning, itching desire to  reign everywhere. He is not a normal man physically and is  unbalanced by a monumental vanity--arrogance--egotism.    \"When your Frau is so busily sewing, she is sewing for her  household, it is true, but she is consciously and unconsciously  sewing for Wilhelm. When your Fraeulein goes out to her etching  lesson, she is aware of being of the magnificent German people, and  shares a part of the national ambition to excel. It's this that we  haven't got in America and can't well have under our system. But  it's this unified, disciplined zeal that enables two or three  ordinary Germans to do what it takes four ordinary Yankees to do.  Clad in armor and with a glistening sword in "]]]
