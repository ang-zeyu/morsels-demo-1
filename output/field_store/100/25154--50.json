They loved him as a father.    His last act was to buy ten type-writers for the girls in that  department.    Has the work paid?    Ask any of those young men and women who have gone out from Cooper  Institute to earn their own living.    Not one of them had to pay a cent for his education.    No one is admitted who does not expect to earn his living.    Mr. Cooper did not love weak, idle young people, who are willing  their parents shall take care of them.    The work has grown so large that more money is needed--perhaps  another million.    Mr. Cooper gave it two millions of dollars.    Many are turned from the doors because there is no more room.    Some of the pupils from the Institute have become teachers.    One receives two dollars an hour for teaching.    Several engrave on wood.    One receives one hundred and fifty dollars a month.    Another, a lady, married a gentleman of wealth, and to show her  gratitude to Mr. Cooper has opened another \"Free School of Art.\"    Is it any wonder that when Peter Cooper died thirty-five hundred  came up from the Institution to lay roses upon his coffin.    His last words to his son and daughter were not to forget Cooper  Union.    They have just given one hundred thousand dollars to it.    Mr. Cooper had many friends among the great and good of the land.    He died as unselfishly as he had lived, and who can measure the good  he did in the world?            [Illustration: EDISON.]          A GREAT INVENTOR.      Thomas A. Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, February 11, 1847.    There was nothing in Milan to make a boy wish to do great deeds.    There was a canal there.    Thomas had one great help--his mother.    She had been a teacher.    Her greatest wish for her son was that he should love knowledge.    Thomas had a quick mind.    He inquired into everything.    He was fond of getting every little thing well learned.    He never did things by halves.    He loved to try experiments.    When Thomas was a very little boy, only six years old, and still  wearing dresses, he did a very funny thing.    He was one day found missing.    His frightened parents searched for him long and anxiously.    Where do you think he was found?    They found him in the barn, sitting on a nest of goose eggs, with  his dress spread out to keep them warm.    He thought he could hatch some goslings as well as the mother-goose.    He had placed some food near by so that he might stay as long as  necessary.    He went to a regular school only two months.    His father and mother were his teachers.    His father, to encourage him to read, paid him for every book which  he read.    But Thomas did not need to be paid to read, for he read with  pleasure every volume he could get hold of.    When he was ten years old, he was reading such books as Gibbon's  \"History of Rome,\" Hume's \"History of England,\" and Sear's \"History  of the World.\"    Besides these, he had read several books about chemistry.    He loved to read about great men and their deeds.    When he played, it was at building plank roads, digging caves, and  exploring the banks of the canal.    When only twelve years of age, he was obliged to go out into the  world and earn his own living.    He obtained a place as train-boy on the Grand Trunk Railroad, in  Eastern Michigan.    He sold apples, peanuts, song-books, and papers.    He had such a pleasant, sunny face that everyone liked to buy of  him.    He succeeded so well that soon he had four boys working under him.    This was not enough to keep him busy.    He had never lost his liking for chemistry.    He managed to trade some of his papers for things with which to try  experiments.    He found a book which helped him.    He fitted up an old baggage car as a room for his experiments.    He was afraid some one would touch his chemicals; so he labelled  every bottle, \"Poison.\"    Soon this busy boy had another business.    He bought three hundred pounds of old type from the \"Detroit Free  Press.\"    He had gained a little knowledge of printing by keeping his eyes  open when buying papers.    Soon a paper, called the \"Grand Trunk Herald,\" was printed by Master  Tom.    This paper was twelve by sixteen inches in size.    It was filled with railway gossip and many other things of interest  to travelers.    Baggagemen and brakemen wrote articles for it.    George Stephenson, who built a great bridge at Montreal, liked it so  well that he ordered an extra edition for his own use.    Everybody liked it.    The \"London Times\" spoke of it as the only paper in the world  published on a railway train.    But the \"Grand Trunk Herald\" had a sad ending.    Do you know what phosphorus is?    It is a substance which will take fire of itself if not kept under  water.    Tom's bottle of phosphorus was thrown to the floor by the jolting of  the car.    Soon everything was on fire.    The conductor rushed in and threw all the type and chemicals out of  the car.    He also gave the young chemist a thrashing.    Poor Thomas gathered up what was left.    He put his things in the basement of his father's house.    Thomas's father now lived at Port Huron.    Thomas always slept at home.    He now printed another and a larger journal.    This was called the \"Paul Pry.\"    In this he published an article which one of his subscribers did not  like.    The angry man, meeting Thomas on the banks of the St. Clair River,  picked him up and threw him in.    Thomas was a good swimmer and reached the shore in safety.    But he did not care for the printing business any more.    During the four years in which Thomas Edison was a train-boy, he had  earned two thousand dollars and given it all to his parents.    When in Detroit, he read as much as possible from the public  library.    Once he thought he would begin with number one and read each of the  thousand volumes.    He read until he had finished a long row of hard books on a shelf  fifteen feet long.    Then he made up his mind that anyone would have to live as long as  Methuselah to read a library through, and gave up the plan.    Thomas became interested in telegraphy during the Civil War.    He used to telegraph the headings in his paper ahead one station.    He thought this a good way to advertise.    He finally bought a good book about electricity.    Soon the basement of the house at Port Huron was filled with many  things beside printing presses.    He used stove-pipe wire, and soon had a telegraph wire between the  basement and the home of a boy friend.    Perhaps it was a good thing that all the children in the Edison  family were not like Thomas.    Had they been, the poor old house would scarcely have held them.    But the mother was proud of all that Thomas did.    She did not worry over the bottles, wires, strings, and printing  presses.    About this time Thomas did a brave thing.    The station agent at Mt. Clemens had a baby boy two years old.    This baby crept on to the track in front of a train just coming in.    Quick as thought, young Edison rushed to the track and saved the  child at the risk of his own life.    The baby's father was very grateful and offered to teach Thomas  telegraphy.    Of course, Thomas was very happy, and accepted the offer.    He came to Mt. Clemens every evening, after working hard all day.    He did so well that, in five months, he was given a position at Port  Huron.    He earned six and one-quarter dollars a week.    He worked almost night and day, so that he might learn all he could  about it.    His mother said that the world would hear from her boy some day.    Afterwards he worked in several places.    In Indianapolis, though not yet seventeen, he invented his first  telegraph instrument.    This was thought to be a great thing for so young a boy to do.    He lost several places because he tried new ways.    At last, he was obliged to walk nearly all the way to Louisville  because he had no money.    Here he was given a good position.    He stayed several years.    Under the telegraph rooms was an elegant bank.    One day, while experimenting, he spilled a great bottle of acid.    This acid went through the floor into the bank below.    Of course it spoiled the ceiling, handsome carpets, and furniture.    So the unfortunate inventor had to leave Louisville.    He finally gave up trying to be a telegraph operator.    He opened a little shop.    He invented many things, and kept on thinking.    He could not make his inventions successful, for he had little  money.    He thought so hard that he forgot everything else.    Once he was asked to speak before a company.    He forgot all about it.    They sent for him, and found him at the top of a house putting up a  telegraph line.    He went in his working clothes to make his speech.    He felt queer when he found a room full of elegant ladies.    But he made a good speech.    Then he went to New York.    There he walked the streets three weeks, looking for work.    Nobody wanted a man who experimented.    By chance, he one day went into an office where the telegraph  instrument was out of repair.    He offered to fix it.    They laughed at him, but let him try.    He succeeded in fixing it.    They gave him a good position.    From this time on there were better times for him.    After this the world soon sang his praises; and, in the next ten  years, Fortune poured into his lap half a million dollars.    This was the result of his thinking.    The man who was in charge of the United States Patent Office called  him \"the young man who keeps the pathway to the Patent Office hot  with his footsteps.\"    Mr. Edison believed that two messages could be sent over the same  wire at the same time.    Of course the world laughed at the idea.    But soon our inventor managed to send four messages over the same  wire at the same time.    Then the world stopped laughing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#9)"],[1,"he is not astonished. These have lost the _stimulus  of novelty_--i. e., a certain _reminiscence_ of them has remained with  the child, they have _impressed_ themselves upon him.    Long before the thirtieth week, healthy children distinguish human faces  definitely from one another; first, the faces of the mother and the  nurse, then the face of the father, seen less often; and all three of  these from every strange face. Probably faces are the first thing  frequently perceived clearly by the eye. It has been found surprising  that infants so much earlier recognize human faces and forms, and follow  them with the gaze, than they do other objects. But human forms and  faces, being large, moving objects, awaken interest more than other  objects do; and on account of the manner of their movements, and because  they are the source from which the voice issues, are essentially  different from other objects in the field of vision. \"In these movements  they are also characterized as a coherent whole, and the face, as a  whitish-reddish patch with the two sparkling eyes, is always a part of  this image that will be easy to recognize, even for one who has seen it  but a few times\" (Helmholtz).    Hence the memory for faces is established earlier than that for other  visual impressions, and with this the ability to recognize members of  the family. A little girl, who does not speak at all, looks at pictures  with considerable interest in the seventh month, \"and points meantime  with her little forefinger to the heads of the human figures\" (Frau von  Struempell).    My child in the second month could already localize the face and voice  of his mother, but the so-called knowing (\"Erkennen\") is a recognition  (Wiedererkennen) which presupposes a very firm _association of the  memory-images_. This fundamental function attached to the memory can  have but a slow development, because it demands an accumulation of  memory-images and precision in them.    In the second three months it is so far developed, at least, that  strange faces are at once known as strange, and are distinguished from  those of parents and nurse; for they excite astonishment or fear  (crying) while the faces of the latter do not. But the latter, if  absent, are not yet, at this period, missed by most children. Hence it  is worthy of note that a girl in her twelfth month recognized her  nurse after six days' absence, immediately, \"with sobs of joy,\" as the  mother reports (Frau von Struempell); another recognized her father,  after a separation of four days, even in the tenth month (Lindner).    In the seventh month my child did _not_ recognize his nurse, to whom  he had for months been accustomed, after an absence of four weeks.  Another child, however, at four months noticed at evening the absence  of his nurse, who had been gone only a day, and cried lustily upon the  discovery, looking all about the room, and crying again every time  after searching in vain (Wyma, 1881). At ten months the same child  used to be troubled by the absence of his parents, though he bore  himself with indifference toward them when he saw them again. At this  period a single nine-pin out of the whole set could not be taken away  without his noticing it, and at the age of a year and a half this  child knew at once whether one of his ten animals was missing or not.  In the nineteenth and twenty-first months my boy recognized his father  immediately from a distance, after a separation of several days, and  once after two weeks' absence; and in his twenty-third month his joy  at seeing again his playthings after an absence of eleven and a half  weeks (with his parents) was very lively, great as was the child's  forgetfulness in other respects at this period. A favorite toy could  often be taken from him without its being noticed or once asked for.  But when the child--in his eighteenth month--after having been  accustomed to bring to his mother two towels which he would afterward  carry back to their place, on one occasion had only one towel given  back to him, he came with inquiring look and tone to get the second.    This observation, which is confirmed by some similar ones, proves that  at a year and a half the memory for visual and motor ideas that belong  together was already well developed without the knowledge of the  corresponding words. But artificial associations of this sort need  continual renewing, otherwise they are soon forgotten; the remembrance  of them is speedily lost even in the years of childhood.    It is noteworthy, in connection with this, that what has been lately  acquired, e. g., verses learned by heart, can be recited more fluently  during sleep than in the waking condition. At the age of three years  and five months a girl recited a stanza of five lines on the occasion  of a birthday festival, not without some stumbling, but one night soon  after the birthday she repeated the whole of the rhymes aloud in her  sleep without stumbling at all (Frau von Struempell).    It is customary, generally, to assume that the memory of adults does  not extend further back than to the fourth year of life. Satisfactory  observations on this point are not known to exist. But it is certainly  of the first consequence, in regard to the development of the faculty  of memory, whether the later experiences of the child have any  characteristic in common with the earlier experiences. For many of  these experiences no such agreement exists; nothing later on reminds  us of the once existing inability to balance the head, or of the  former inability to turn around, to sit, to stand, to walk, of the  inborn difficulty of hearing, inability to accommodate the eye, and to  distinguish our own body from foreign objects; hence, no man, and no  child, remembers these states. But this is not true of what is  acquired later. My child when less than three years old remembered  very well--and would almost make merry over himself at it--the time  when he could not yet talk, but articulated incorrectly and went  imperfectly through the first, often-repeated performances taught by  his nurse, \"How tall is the child?\" and \"Where is the rogue?\" If I  asked him, after he had said \"Fruehstuecken\" correctly, how he used to  say it, he would consider, and would require merely a suggestion of  accessory circumstances, in order to give the correct answer _Fritick_  and so with many words difficult to pronounce. The child of three and  even of four years can remember separate experiences of his second  year, and a person that will take the pains to remind him frequently  of them will be able easily to carry the recollections of the second  and third years far on into the more advanced years of childhood. It  is merely because no one makes such a useless experiment that older  children lose the memory-images of their second year. These fade out  because they are not combined with new ones.    At what time, however, the first natural association of a particular  idea with a new one that appears weeks or months later, takes place  without being called up by something in the mean time, is very hard to  determine. On this point we must first gather good observations out of  the second and third half-years, like the following:    \"In the presence of a boy a year and a half old it was related that  another boy whom he knew, and who was then in the country far away,  had fallen and hurt his knee. No one noticed the child, who was  playing as the story was told. After some weeks the one who had fallen  came into the room, and the little one in a lively manner ran up to  the new-comer and cried, 'Fall, hurt leg!'\" (Stiebel, 1865).    Another example is given by G. Lindner (1882): \"The mother of a  two-year-old child had made for it out of a postal-card a sled  (Schlitten), which was destroyed after a few hours, and found its way  into the waste-basket. Just four weeks later another postal-card comes,  and it is taken from the carrier by the child and handed to the mother  with the words,'_Mamma, Litten!_' This was in summer, when there was  nothing to remind the child of the sled. Soon after the same wish was  expressed on the receipt of a letter also.\"    I have known like cases of attention, of recollection, and of  intelligence in the third year where they were not suspected. The  child, unnoticed, hears all sorts of things said, seizes on this or  that expression, and weeks after brings into connection, fitly or  unfitly, the memory-images, drawing immediately from an insufficient  number of particular cases a would-be general conclusion.    Equally certain with this fact is the other, less known or less  noticed, that, _even before the first attempts at speaking, such a  generalizing and therefore concept-forming combination of  memory-images regularly takes place_.    All children in common have inborn in them the ability to combine all  sorts of sense-impressions connected with food, when these appear  again individually, with one another, or with memory-images of such  impressions, so that adaptive movements suited to the obtaining of  fresh food arise as the result of this association. In the earlier  months these are simple and easier to be seen, and I have given  several examples (Vol. I, pp. 250, 260, 329, 333). Later such  movements, through the perfecting of the language of gesture and the  growth of this very power of association, become more and more  complicated: e. g., in his sixteenth month my boy saw a closed box,  out of which he had the day before received a cake; he at once made  with his hands a begging movement, yet he could not speak a word. In  the twenty-first month I took out of the pocket of a coat which was  hanging with many others in the wardrobe a biscuit and gave it to the  child. When he had eaten it, he went directly to the wardrobe and  looked in the right coat for a second biscuit. At this period also the  child can not have been thinking in the unspoken"]]]
