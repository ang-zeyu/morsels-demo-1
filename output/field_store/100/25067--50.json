Good biz! Don't waste any more time,  then. We're rather late.\"    The song that Winona had chosen was a bright little Irish ditty, with a  catchy tune and lively accompaniment. Garnet played the air softly on  the mandoline, and the two girls sang in unison, keeping strictly  together, and pronouncing very plainly, so that the point of the amusing  words should not be lost. The audience shrieked with laughter, and would  have demanded a further encore, had not Margaret pointed to the clock,  and shaken her head firmly. There were other items on the program and  time was going all too fast.    Another violin solo, a recitation and a Highland fling followed; then  the concert wound up with a Christy Minstrel song from several members  of the Sixth. This last was the triumph of the afternoon. Patricia  prided herself on her preparations. She had placed a newspaper inside  the grand piano over the strings, and when the hammers struck against it  the effect of the accompaniment was exactly that of a banjo. She had  borrowed two sets of castanets, a pair of cymbals, and a triangle, and  with these loud-sounding instruments she and her companions emphasized  the chorus. Garnet and Winona helped with mandoline and guitar, so the  general result was quite orchestral. During the performance of this  chef-d'oeuvre some of the prefects went round with collecting bags,  which were passed along the benches.        \"Come, my dark-eyed honey,      And help to spend my money,\"    chanted the minstrels lustily, and the audience smiled at the  appropriateness of the words.    It was felt that the Symposium had been an enormous success. The girls  were quite loath to leave, and dispersed slowly from the gymnasium. Many  eyes were turned on Winona and Garnet as they carried their instruments  down from the platform. \"Who are they?\" every one was asking, for so far  their names were not known outside their own form. \"The two County  Scholarship holders,\" somebody replied, and the information was passed  on.    Next morning, Margaret proudly posted up the result of the collection,  which amounted to L2 13_s._ 7_d._--a very substantial sum in the  estimation of the school.    \"It ought to be sufficient to buy a cup!\" she triumphed. \"Miss Bishop  has promised to send for some catalogues, so that we can look up the  prices. We shall start the season well, at any rate. Kirsty's almost  ready to stand on her head! I never saw any one so elated!\"    \"Except yourself!\" smiled Patricia.    \"Cela va sans dire, camarade!\"    Garnet and Winona, walking down the High Street together after the  performance, also compared notes.    \"It was fine! I do admire Margaret. Mustn't it be splendid to be head of  the school?\" sighed Garnet enviously.    \"Do you think so? Yes, I suppose it is, but if I had my choice, I'd a  dozen times over rather be Games Captain,\" answered Winona.          CHAPTER V    Aunt Harriet      It is high time now that we paused to consider a very important person  indeed in this story, namely Miss Harriet Beach, but for whose  invitation Winona would never have attended Seaton High School at all.  Aunt Harriet was what is generally known as \"a character,\" that is to  say, she was possessed of a strong personality, and was decidedly  eccentric. Though her age verged on sixty she preserved the energy of  her thirties, and prided herself upon her physical fitness. She was  tall, with a high color, keen brown eyes, a large nose, a determined  mouth, and iron gray hair. In her youth she must have been handsome, and  even now her erect figure and dark, well-marked eyebrows gave her a  certain air of distinction. She was a most thoroughly capable woman,  reliable, and strongly philanthropic: not in a sentimental way, however;  she disapproved of indiscriminate almsgiving, and would have considered  it a crime to bestow a penny on a beggar without making a proper  investigation of his case. She was a tower of strength to most of the  charitable institutions in the city, a terror to the professional  pauper, but a real friend to the deserving. Her time was much occupied  with committees, secretarial duties, district visiting, workhouse  inspection and other public interests. She was apt indeed to have more  than her share of civic business; her reputation for absolute  reliability caused people to get into the habit of saying \"Oh, go to  Miss Beach!\" on every occasion, and as she invariably proved the willing  horse, she justified the proverb and received the work in increased  proportions.    Like most people, Aunt Harriet had her faults. She was apt to be a  trifle overbearing and domineering, she lacked patience with others'  weaknesses, and was too doctrinaire in her views. She tried very hard to  push the world along, but she forgot sometimes that \"the mills of God  grind slowly,\" and that it is only after much waiting and many days that  the bread cast upon the waters returns to us. She prided herself on her  candor and lack of \"humbug.\" Unfortunately, people who \"speak their  minds\" generally treat their hearers to a sample of their worst instead  of their best, and their excessive truthfulness scarcely meets with the  gratitude they consider it deserves. Miss Beach's many estimable  qualities, however, overbalanced her crudities, her friends shrugged  their shoulders and told each other it was \"her way,\" \"her heart was all  right.\" Though she might give offense, people forgot it, and came to her  again next time they wanted anything done, and the universal verdict was  that she was \"trying at times,\" but on the whole one of the most useful  citizens which Seaton possessed.    If there was one person more than another who wore out Miss Beach's  patience it was her niece and goddaughter, Mrs. Woodward. She had a  sincere affection for her, but their two personalities were at  absolutely opposite poles. She admitted that Florita was amiable,  well-meaning, and thoroughly affectionate, but for the rest she  considered her weak, foolishly helpless, liable to extravagance, a poor  housekeeper, and a perfect jelly-fish in her methods of bringing up her  family. In vain did Aunt Harriet, on successive visits, preach firmness,  order, consistency and other maternal virtues; her niece would brace  herself up to a temporary effort, but would relax again directly her  guest had departed, and the children--little rogues!--discovered at a  remarkably early age that they could do pretty much as they liked. The  Woodwards always dreaded the advent of Aunt Harriet, her disapproval of  their general conduct was so manifest. By dint of urging from their  mother they made extra attempts at good behavior before the august  visitor, but they were subject to awful relapses. Mrs. Woodward, on her  side, considered she had her trials, for her aunt had a habit of  arriving suddenly, giving only a few hours' notice by telegram, and she  could not forbear the suspicion that her revered godparent wished to  surprise her housekeeping and catch her unprepared. On one occasion,  indeed, when the family came down--rather late--for breakfast, Aunt  Harriet was discovered sitting on the rustic seat outside the  dining-room window. She explained that she had taken the 5 a.m.  workmen's train and had come to spend a long day with them, but not  wishing to disturb the house at too early an hour she had remained in  the garden enjoying the view until somebody arrived downstairs. In  spite of her rather angular attitude, Miss Beach was a very kind and  generous friend to her widowed niece, and she was the one person in the  world to whom Mrs. Woodward naturally thought of turning in time of  trouble. Aunt Harriet's advice might not always be palatable, but it was  combined with such practical help that there seemed no alternative but  to follow it.    Miss Beach, though not a rich woman, was possessed of very comfortable  private means. She lived in an old-fashioned house just opposite the  Abbey, and her windows looked out on a view of towers and cloisters and  tall lime trees, with a foreground of monuments. To some people the  array of tombstones would have proved a dismal prospect, but she  declared it never distressed her in the least. She prided herself  greatly on the fact that she had been born in the house where her  father, grandfather and great-grandfather had also come into the world  and spent their lives. Except for an occasional expedition to Highfield,  she rarely left home. All her interests were in Seaton, and she became  miserable directly if she were away from her native city.    The little Woodwards had never regarded it as much of a treat to go and  stay at 10, Abbey Close. The restraint which the visit necessitated  quite neutralized the afternoon at the cinema with which their aunt  invariably entertained them. The fine old Chippendale furniture had to  be treated with a respect not meted out to the chairs and tables at  home, boots must be scrupulously wiped on the door-mat, bedrooms left  tidy, and books and ornaments were to be held altogether sacred from the  ravages of prying young fingers.    Winona had taken up her residence there with somewhat the feeling of a  novice entering a nunnery. She was not quite sure how she and Aunt  Harriet were going to get on. To her great relief, however, things  turned out better than she expected. Miss Beach received her with  unusual complacency, and the two settled down quite harmoniously  together. The fact was that Winona, a visitor with nothing to do, and  Winona a busy High School girl, were utterly different persons. It is  one thing to wander round somebody else's house and feel bored, and  quite another to hang up your hat, realize you are part and parcel of  the establishment, and occupy yourself with your own business.

See also a passage above quoted from the same essay, where he speaks  of \"the _miraculous_ accounts of travellers;\" evidently using the word  in this sense.    Perhaps it was superfluous to cite authority for applying the term  \"miracle\" to whatever is \"highly improbable;\" but it is important to  the students of Hume, to be fully aware that he uses those two  expressions as synonymous; since otherwise they would mistake the  meaning of that passage which he justly calls \"a general maxim worthy  of your attention.\"    [15] \"Events may be so extraordinary that they can hardly be  established by testimony.

[23] It is well know with how much learning and ingenuity the  Rationalists of the German school have laboured to throw discredit on  the literal interpretation of the narratives, both of the Old and the  New Testaments; representing them as MYTHS, i.e., fables allegorically  describing some physical or moral phaenomena--philosophical  principles--systems, &c.--under the figure of actions performed by  certain ideal personages; these allegories having been, afterwards,  through the mistake of the vulgar, believed as history. Thus, the real  historical existence of such a person as the supposed founder of the  Christian religion, and the acts attributed to him, are denied in the  literal sense, and the whole of the evangelical history is explained  on the \"mythical\" theory.    Now it is a remarkable circumstance in reference to the point at  present before us, that an eminent authoress of this century has  distinctly declared that Napoleon Buonaparte was NOT A MAN, but a  SYSTEM.

It may seem arrogant for an obscure and nameless individual to claim  the glory of having put to death the most formidable of all recorded  heroes. But a shadowy champion may be overthrown by a shadowy  antagonist. Many a terrific spectre has been laid by the beams of a  halfpenny candle. And if I have succeeded in making out, in the  foregoing pages, a probable case of suspicion, it must, I think, be  admitted, that there is some ground for my present boast, of having  _killed_ Napoleon Buonaparte.    Let but the circumstances of the case be considered. This mighty  Emperor, who had been so long the bugbear of the civilized world,  after having obtained successes and undergone reverses, such as never  befel any (other at least) _real_ potentate, was at length sentenced  to confinement in the remote island of St. Helena: a measure which  many persons wondered at, and many objected to, on various grounds;  not unreasonably, supposing the illustrious exile to be a real person;  but on the supposition of his being only a man of straw, the  situation was exceedingly favourable for keeping him out of the way of  impertinent curiosity, when not wanted, and for making him the  foundation of any new plots that there might be occasion to conjure  up.    About this juncture it was that the public attention was first  invited, by these pages, to the question as to the real existence of  Napoleon Buonaparte. They excited, it may be fairly supposed, along  with much surprise and much censure, some degree of doubt, and  probably of consequent inquiry. No fresh evidence, as far as I can  learn, of the truth of the disputed points, was brought forward to  dispel these doubts. We heard, however, of the most jealous  precautions being used to prevent any intercourse between the  formidable prisoner, and any stranger who, from motives of curiosity,  might wish to visit him. The \"man in the iron mask\" could hardly have  been more rigorously secluded: and we also heard various contradictory  reports of conversations between him and the few who were allowed  access to him; the falsehood and inconsistency of most of these  reports being proved in contemporary publications.    At length, just about the time when the public scepticism respecting  this extraordinary personage might be supposed to have risen to an  alarming height, it was announced to us that he was dead! A stop was  thus put, most opportunely, to all troublesome inquiries. I do not  undertake to deny that such a person did live and die. That he was,  and that he did, _everything_ that is reported, we cannot believe,  unless we consent to admit contradictory statements; but many of the  events reported, however marvellous, are certainly not, when taken  separately, physically impossible. But I would only entreat the candid  reader to reflect what might naturally be expected, on the supposition  of the surmises contained in the present work being well founded.  Supposing the whole of the tale I have been considering to have been a  fabrication, what would be the natural result of such attempt to  excite inquiry into its truth? Evidently the shortest and most  effectual mode of avoiding detection, would be to _kill_ the phantom,  and so get rid of him at once. A ready and decisive answer would thus  be provided to any one in whom the foregoing arguments might have  excited suspicions: \"Sir, there can be no doubt that such a person  existed, and performed what is related of him; and if you will just  take a voyage to St. Helena, you may see with your own eyes,--not him,  indeed, for he is no longer living,--but his _tomb_: and what evidence  would you have that is more decisive?\"    So much for his _Death_: as for his _Life_,--it is just published by  an eminent writer: besides which, the shops will supply us with  abundance of busts and prints of this great man; all striking  likenesses--of one another. The most incredulous must be satisfied  with this! \"Stat magni NOMINIS umbra!\"    KONX OMPAX.          POSTSCRIPT TO THE SEVENTH EDITION.
