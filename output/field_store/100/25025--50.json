The lord mayor, a very sober and religious gentleman,  appointed physicians and surgeons for the relief of the poor, I mean the  diseased poor, and in particular ordered the College of Physicians[76]  to publish directions for cheap remedies for the poor in all the  circumstances of the distemper. This, indeed, was one of the most  charitable and judicious things that could be done at that time; for  this drove the people from haunting the doors of every disperser of  bills, and from taking down blindly and without consideration, poison  for physic, and death instead of life.    This direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of the whole  college; and as it was particularly calculated for the use of the poor,  and for cheap medicines, it was made public, so that everybody might see  it, and copies were given gratis to all that desired it. But as it is  public and to be seen on all occasions, I need not give the reader of  this the trouble of it.    It remains to be mentioned now what public measures were taken by the  magistrates for the general safety and to prevent the spreading of the  distemper when it broke out. I shall have frequent occasion to speak of  the prudence of the magistrates, their charity, their vigilance for the  poor and for preserving good order, furnishing provisions, and the like,  when the plague was increased as it afterwards was. But I am now upon  the order and regulations which they published for the government of  infected families.    I mentioned above shutting of houses up, and it is needful to say  something particularly to that; for this part of the history of the  plague is very melancholy. But the most grievous story must be told.    About June, the lord mayor of London, and the court of aldermen, as I  have said, began more particularly to concern themselves for the  regulation of the city.    The justices of the peace for Middlesex,[77] by direction of the  secretary of state, had begun to shut up houses in the parishes of St.  Giles-in-the-Fields, St. Martin's, St. Clement's-Danes, etc., and it was  with good success; for in several streets where the plague broke out,  upon strict guarding the houses that were infected, and taking care to  bury those that died as soon as they were known to be dead, the plague  ceased in those streets. It was also observed that the plague decreased  sooner in those parishes after they had been visited to the full than it  did in the parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, Whitechapel,  Stepney, and others; the early care taken in that manner being a great  means to the putting a check to it.    This shutting up of the houses was a method first taken, as I  understand, in the plague which happened in 1603, at the coming of King  James I. to the crown; and the power of shutting people up in their own  houses was granted by act of Parliament, entitled \"An Act for the  Charitable Relief and Ordering of Persons Infected with Plague.\" On  which act of Parliament the lord mayor and aldermen of the city of  London founded the order they made at this time, and which took place  the 1st of July, 1665, when the numbers of infected within the city  were but few; the last bill for the ninety-two parishes being but four,  and some houses having been shut up in the city, and some people being  removed to the pesthouse beyond Bunhill Fields, in the way to Islington.  I say by these means, when there died near one thousand a week in the  whole, the number in the city was but twenty-eight; and the city was  preserved more healthy, in proportion, than any other place all the time  of the infection.    These orders of my lord mayor's were published, as I have said, the  latter end of June, and took place from the 1st of July, and were as  follow: viz.,--           ORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF       THE CITY OF LONDON, CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE; 1665.         Whereas in the reign of our late sovereign King James, of happy       memory, an act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of       persons infected with the plague; whereby authority was given to       justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head officers,       to appoint within their several limits examiners, searchers,       watchmen, keepers, and buriers, for the persons and places       infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the performance of       their offices; and the same statute did also authorize the giving       of their directions as unto them for other present necessity should       seem good in their discretions: it is now, upon special       consideration, thought very expedient, for preventing and avoiding       of infection of sickness (if it shall please Almighty God), that       these officers following be appointed, and these orders hereafter       duly observed.         _Examiners to be appointed to every Parish._         First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every       parish there be one, two, or more persons of good sort and credit       chosen by the alderman, his deputy, and common council of every       ward, by the name of examiners, to continue in that office for the       space of two months at least: and if any fit person so appointed       shall refuse to undertake the same, the said parties so refusing to       be committed to prison until they shall conform themselves       accordingly.         _The Examiner's Office._         That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn       from time to time what houses in every parish be visited, and what       persons be sick, and of what diseases, as near as they can inform       themselves, and, upon doubt in that case, to command restraint of       access until it appear what the disease shall prove; and if they       find any person sick of the infection, to give order to the       constable that the house be shut up; and, if the constable shall be       found remiss and negligent, to give notice thereof to the alderman       of the ward.         _Watchmen._         That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen,--one       for every day, and the other for the night; and that these watchmen       have a special care that no person go in or out of such infected       houses whereof they have the charge, upon pain of severe       punishment. And the said watchmen to do such further offices as the       sick house shall need and require; and if the watchman be sent upon       any business, to lock up the house and take the key with him; and       the watchman by day to attend until ten o'clock at night, and the       watchman by night until six in the morning.         _Searchers._         That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every       parish, such as are of honest reputation and of the best sort as       can be got in this kind; and these to be sworn to make due search       and true report, to the utmost of their knowledge, whether the       persons whose bodies they are appointed to search do die of the       infection, or of what other diseases, as near as they can. And that       the physicians who shall be appointed for the cure and prevention       of the infection do call before them the said searchers, who are or       shall be appointed for the several parishes under their respective       cares, to the end they may consider whether they be fitly qualified       for that employment, and charge them from time to time, as they       shall see cause, if they appear defective in their duties.         That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to use       any public work or employment, or keep a shop or stall, or be       employed as a laundress, or in any other common employment       whatsoever.         _Chirurgeons._[78]         For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as there has been       heretofore great abuse in misreporting the disease, to the further       spreading of the infection, it is therefore ordered that there be       chosen and appointed able and discreet chirurgeons besides those       that do already belong to the pesthouse, amongst whom the city and       liberties to be quartered as they lie most apt and convenient; and       every of these to have one quarter for his limit. And the said       chirurgeons in every of their limits to join with the searchers for       the view of the body, to the end there may be a true report made of       the disease.         And further: that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search such       like persons as shall either send for them, or be named and       directed unto them by the examiners of every parish, and inform       themselves of the disease of the said parties.         And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from       all other cures,[79] and kept only to this disease of the       infection, it is ordered that every of the said chirurgeons shall       have twelvepence a body searched by them, to be paid out of the       goods of the party searched, if he be able, or otherwise by the       parish.         _Nurse Keepers._         If any nurse keeper shall remove herself out of any infected house       before twenty-eight days after the decease of any person dying of       the infection, the house to which the said nurse keeper doth so       remove herself shall be shut up until the said twenty-eight days       shall be expired.         ORDERS CONCERNING INFECTED HOUSES, AND PERSONS SICK OF THE PLAGUE.         _Notice to be given of the Sickness._         The master of every house, as soon as any one in his house       complaineth either of botch, or purple, or swelling in any part of       his body, or falleth otherwise dangerously sick without apparent       cause of some other disease, shall give notice thereof to the       examiner of health, within two hours after the said sign "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#9)"],[1,"I think  of that--your mother is an angel among women, and she has taught you the  things she loves herself.    \"But my business is with the cattle, and I've had you out with me since  you could climb on the back of a horse. I've watched you, with the rope  and the irons and in the saddle and all. You've been in tight places  that would try the mettle of a man grown--I mind the time ye escaped  Colorou's band, and we thought ye dead 'til ye came to us in Laramie.  You've showed that you're able to hold your own on the range, lad. Your  mother's all for the music--but I leave it to you.    \"Ten thousand dollars I'll give ye, if that's your wish, and you can go  to Europe as she wishes and study and make tunes for others to play. Or  if ye prefer it, I'll brand you a herd of she stock and let ye go your  ways. No son of mine can take orders from his father after he's a man  grown, and I'm not to the age where I can sit with the pipe from morning  to night and let another run my outfit. I've talked it over with your  mother, and she'll bide by your decision, as I shall do.    \"So I put it in a nutshell, Robert. You're twenty-one to-day; a man  grown, and husky as they're made. 'Tis time you faced the world and  lived your life. You've been a good lad--as lads go.\" He stopped there  to rub his jaw thoughtfully, perhaps remembering certain incidents  in Buddy's full-flavored past. Buddy--grown to plain Bud among his  fellows--turned red without losing the line of hardness that had come to  his lips.    \"You're of legal age to be called a man, and the future's before ye.  I'll give ye five hundred cows with their calves beside them--you can  choose them yourself, for you've a sharp eye for stock--and you can go  where ye will. Or I'll give ye ten thousand dollars and ye can go to  Europe and make tunes if you're a mind to. And whatever ye choose it'll  be make or break with ye. Ye can sleep on the decision, for I've no wish  that ye should choose hastily and be sorry after.\"    Buddy--grown to Bud--lifted a booted foot and laid it across his other  knee and with his forefinger absently whirled the long-pointed rower on  his spur. The hardness at his lips somehow spread to his eyes, that were  bent on the whirring rower. It was the look that had come into the face  of the baby down on the Staked Plains when Ezra called and called after  he had been answered twice; the look that had held firm the lips of the  boy who had lain very flat on his stomach in the roof of the dugout and  had watched the Utes burning the cabin.    \"There's no need to sleep on it,\" he said after a minute. \"You've raised  me, and spent some money on me--but I've saved you a man's wages ever  since I was ten. If you think I've evened things up, all right. If you  don't, make out your bill and I'll pay it when I can. There's no reason  why you should give me anything I haven't earned, just because you're my  father. You earned all you've got, and I guess I can do the same. As you  say, I'm a man. I'll go at the future man fashion. And,\" he added with a  slight flare of the nostrils, \"I'll start in the morning.\"    \"And is it to make tunes for other folks to play?\" Bob Birnie asked after  a silence, covertly eyeing him.    \"No, sir. There's more money in cattle. I'll make my stake in the  cow-country, same as you've done.\" He looked up and grinned a little.  \"To the devil with your money and your she-stock! I'll get out all  right--but I'll make my own way.\"    \"You're a stubborn fool, Robert. The Scotch now and then shows itself  like that in a man. I got my start from my father and I'm not ashamed of  it. A thousand pounds--and I brought it to America and to Texas, and got  cattle.\"    Bud laughed and got up, hiding how the talk had struck deep into the  soul of him. \"Then I'll go you one better, dad. I'll get my own start.\"    \"You'll be back home in six months, lad, saying you've changed your  mind,\" Bob Birnie predicted sharply, stung by the tone of young Bud.  \"That,\" he added grimly, \"or for a full belly and a clean bed to crawl  into.\"    Bud stood licking the cigarette he had rolled to hide an unaccountable  trembling of his fingers. \"When I come back I'll be in a position to buy  you out! I'll borrow Skate and Maverick, if you don't mind, till I get  located somewhere.\" He paused while he lighted the cigarette. \"It's the  custom,\" He reminded his father unnecessarily, \"to furnish a man a horse  to ride and one to pack his bed, when he's fired.\"    \"Ye've horses of yer own,\" Bob Birnie retorted, \"and you've no need to  borrow.\"    Bud stood looking down at his father, plainly undecided. \"I don't know  whether they're mine or not,\" he said after a minute. \"I don't know what  it cost you to raise me. Figure it up, if you haven't already, and count  the time I've worked for you. Since you've put me on a business basis,  like raising a calf to shipping age, let's be businesslike about it. You  are good at figuring your profits--I'll leave it to you. And if you find  I've anything coming to me besides my riding outfit and the clothes I've  got, all right; I'll take horses for the balance.\"    He walked off with the swing to his shoulders that had always betrayed  him when he was angry, and Bob Birnie gathered his beard into a handful  and held it while he stared after him. It had been no part of his plan  to set his son adrift on the range without a dollar, but since Bud's  temper was up, it might be a good thing to let him go.    So Bob Birnie went away to confer with his wife, and Bud was left alone  to nurse his hurt while he packed his few belongings. It did hurt him to  be told in that calm, cold-blooded manner that, now he was of legal age,  he would not be expected to stay on at the Tomahawk. Until his father  had spoken to him about it, Bud had not thought much about what he would  do when his school days were over. He had taken life as it was presented  to him week by week, month by month. He had fulfilled his mother's hopes  and had learned to make music. He had lived up to his father's unspoken  standards of a cowman. He had made a \"Hand\" ever since his legs were  long enough to reach the stirrups of a saddle. There was not a better  rider, not a better roper on the range than Bud Birnie. Morally he  was cleaner than most young fellows of his age. He hated trickery, he  reverenced all good women; the bad ones he pitied because he believed  that they sorrowed secretly because they were not good, because they  had missed somehow their real purpose in life, which was to be wife and  mother. He had, in fact grown up clean and true to type. He was Buddy,  grown to be Bud.    And Buddy, now that he was a man, had been told that he was not expected  to stay at home and help his father, and be a comfort to his mother. He  was like a young eagle which, having grown wing-feathers that will bear  the strain of high air currents, has been pecked out of the nest. No  doubt the young eagle resents his unexpected banishment, although in  time he would have felt within himself the urge to go. Leave Bud alone,  and soon or late he would have gone--perhaps with compunctions against  leaving home, and the feeling that he was somehow a disappointment to  his parents. He would have explained to his father, apologized to his  mother. As it was, he resented the alacrity with which his father was  pushing him out.    So he packed his clothes that night, and pushed his guitar into its case  and buckled the strap with a vicious yank, and went off to the bunkhouse  to eat supper with the boys instead of sitting down to the table where  his mother had placed certain dishes which Buddy loved best--wanting to  show in true woman fashion her love and sympathy for him.    Later--it was after Bud had gone to bed--mother came and had a long talk  with him. She was very sweet and sensible, and Bud was very tender with  her. But she could not budge him from his determination to go and make  his way without a Birnie dollar to ease the beginning. Other men had  started with nothing and had made a stake, and there was no reason why  he could not do so.    \"Dad put it straight enough, and it's no good arguing. I'd starve before  I'd take anything from him. I'm entitled to my clothes, and maybe a  horse or two for the work I've done for him while I was growing up. I've  figured out pretty close what it cost to put me through the University,  and what I was worth to him during the summers. Father's Scotch--but  he isn't a darned bit more Scotch than I am, mother. Putting it all  in dollars and cents, I think I've earned more than I cost him. In the  winters, I know I earned my board doing chores and riding line. Many a  little bunch of stock I've saved for him by getting out in the foothills  and driving them down below heavy snowline before a storm. You remember  the bunch of horses I found by watching the magpies--the time we tied  hay in canvas and took it up to them 'til they got strength enough to  follow the trail I trampled in the snow? I earned my board and more,  every winter since I was ten. So I don't believe I owe dad a cent, when  it's all figured out.    \"But you've done for me what money can't repay, mother. I'll always be  in debt to you--and I'll square it by being the kind of a man you've  tried to teach me to be. I will, mother. Dad and the dollars are a  different matter. The debt I owe you will never be paid, but I'm going  to make you glad I know there's a debt. I believe there's a God, because  I know there must have been one to make you! And no matter how far away  I may drift in miles, your Buddy is going to be here with you always,  mother, learning from you all there is of goodness and sweetness.\" He  held her two hands against his face, and she felt his cheeks wet beneath  her palms. Then he took them away and kissed them many times, like a  lover.    \"If I ever have a wife, she's going to have her work cut out for her,\"  He laughed"]]]
