Into this folk-wandering of the Vikings, the first great  outward movement of our Europe in the Middle Ages, is absorbed the  reviving energy of trade, as well as the ever-growing impulse of  pilgrimage. The Vikings are the highest type of explorers; they do not  merely find out new lands and trade with them, but conquer and colonise  them. They extend not merely the knowledge, but the whole state and  being of Europe, to a New World.    Lastly, the partial activity of commerce and religion made universal and  \"political\" by the leading western race--for itself only--is taken up by  all Christendom in the Crusades, borrowed in idea from Spain, but  borrowed with the spirit of the Norse rovers, and made universal for the  Latin world, for the whole federation of Rome. In the eleventh, twelfth,  and thirteenth centuries we have the preparation for the discovery and  colonisation of the outside world by Europeans in the fifteenth,  sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries of the Christian era.    From the conversion of Constantine to the Reformation the story of  Christendom is unbroken; the later Roman Empire is the Church-State of a  Christian Prince, as modern Europe is the Church-State of a nominally  Christian society. Mediaeval Europe thought of itself as nothing but the  old world-state under religion; from Spain to Russia men were living  under a Holy Roman Empire of an Italian, or Teutonic, or Byzantine, or  independent type. England and Russia were not parts of the Germanic  revival of Charlemagne, but they had just the same two elements dominant  in their life: the classical tradition and the Christian Church.    And so throughout this time, the expansion of this society--by whatever  name we may call it, discovery, exploration, geographical knowledge--has  a continuous history. But before the rise of Islam, in the seventh  century, throws Christendom into its proper mediaeval life, before the  new religion begins the really new age, at the end of which lived Henry  himself, we are too far from our subject to feel, for instance in the  fourth and fifth-century pilgrims and in Cosmas Indicopleustes, anything  but a remote preparation for Henry's work. It is only with the seventh  century, and with the time of our own Bede and Wilfrid, that the  necessary introduction to our subject really begins.    Yet as an illustration of the general idea, that discovery is an early  and natural outlet of any vigorous society and is in proportion to the  universal activity of the State, it is not without interest to note that  Christian Pilgrimage begins with Constantine. This, the first  department of exploring energy, at once evidences the new settlement of  religion and politics. Helena, the Emperor's mother, helped, by her  visit to Palestine, her church at Bethlehem, and her discoveries of  relics in Jerusalem, to make a ruling fashion out of the custom of a few  devotees; and eight years after the council of Nicaea, in 333, appeared  the first Christian geography, as a guide-book or itinerary, from  Bordeaux to the Holy Places of Syria, modelled upon the imperial survey  of the Antonines. The route followed in this runs by North Italy,  Aquileia, Sirmium, Constantinople, and Asia Minor, and upon the same  course thousands of nameless pilgrims journeyed in the next three  hundred years, besides some eight or nine who have left an account  mainly religious in form, but containing in substance the widest view of  the globe then possible among Westerns.    Most of the pilgrims, like Jerome's friend Paula, Bishop Eucherius, and  Melania, tread the same path and stop at the same points, but three or  four of them distinctly add some fresh knowledge to the ordinary  results.    St. Silvia, of Aquitaine (_c._ 385), not only travels through Syria, she  visits Lower Egypt and Stony or Sinaitic Arabia, and even Edessa in  Northern Mesopotamia, on the very borders of hostile and heathen Persia.  \"To see the monks\" she wanders through Osrhoeene, comes to Haran, near  which was \"the home of Abraham and the farm of Laban and the well of  Rachel,\" to the environs of Nisibis and Ur of the Chaldees, lost to the  Roman Empire since Julian's defeat; thence by \"Padan-aram\" back to  Antioch. When crossing the Euphrates the pilgrims saw the river \"rush  down in a torrent like the Rhone, but greater,\" and on the way home by  the great military road, then untravelled by Saracens, between Tarsus  and the Bosphorus, Silvia makes a passing note on the strength and  brigand habits of the Isaurian mountaineers, who in the end saved  Christendom from the very Arabs with whom our pilgrim couples them.    Again, Cosmas Indicopleustes, in the time of Justinian, is at the end,  as Silvia is at the beginning, of a definite period, the period of the  Christian empire of Rome, while still \"Caesarean\" and not merely  Byzantine, \"patrician\" and not papal, \"consular\" and not Carolingian.    And contemporary with Cosmas are two of the chief among the earlier or  primitive pilgrims, Theodosius and Antoninus the Martyr. The first-named  indulges in a few excursions--in fancy--beyond his known ground of  Palestine, going as far east as Susa and Babylon, \"where no one can live  for the serpents and hippo-centaurs,\" and south to the Red Sea and its  two arms, \"of which the eastern is called the Persian Gulf,\" and the  western or Arabian runs up to the \"thirteen cities of Arabia destroyed  by Joshua,\"--but, for the rest, his knowledge is not extensive or  peculiar. Antoninus of Placentia, on the other hand, is very  interesting, a sort of older Mandeville, who mixes truth and its  opposite in fairly even proportions and with a sort of resolute  partiality to favourite legends.    He tells us how Tripolis has been ruined by the late earthquake (July 9,  551); how silk and various woven stuffs are sold at Tyre; how the  pilgrims scratched their names on the relics shewn in Cana of  Galilee--\"and here I, sinner that I am, did inscribe the names of my  parents\"; how Bethshan, the metropolis of Galilee, \"is placed on a  hill,\" though really in the plain; how the Samaritans hate Christians  and will hardly speak to them; \"and beware of spitting in their country,  for they will never forgive it\"; how \"the dew comes down upon Hermon the  Little, as David says, 'The dew of Hermon that fell upon the hill of  Zion'\"; how nothing can live or even float in the Dead Sea, \"but is  instantly swallowed up\"--as exact an untruth as was ever told by  traveller; how the Jordan opens a way for pilgrims \"and stands up in a  heap every year at the Epiphany during the baptism of Catechumens, as  David told, 'The sea saw that and fled, Jordan was driven back'\"; how at  Jericho there is a Holy Field \"sown by the Lord with his own hand.\" A  report had been spread that the salt pillar of Lot's wife had been  \"lessened by licking\"; \"it was false,\" said Antoninus, the statue was  just the same as it had always been.    In Jerusalem the pilgrims first went up the Tower of David, \"where he  sang the Psalter,\" and into the Basilica of Sion, where among other  marvels they saw the \"Corner-stone that the builders rejected,\" which  gave out a \"sound like the murmuring of a crowd.\"    We come back again to fact with rather a start when told in the next  section of the Hospitals for 3000 sick folk near the Church of St. Mary,  close to Sion; then with the footprints and relics of Christ, and the  miraculous flight of the Column of Scourging--\"carried away by a cloud  to Caesarea,\" we are taken through a fresh set of \"impressions.\"    The same wild notions of place and time and nature follow the Martyr  through Galilee to Gilboa, \"where David slew Goliath and Saul died,  where no dew or rain ever falls, and where devils appear nightly,  whirled about like fleeces of wool or the waves of the sea\"--to  Nazareth, where was the \"Beam of Christ the Carpenter\"--to Elua, where  fifteen consecrated virgins had tamed a lion and trained it to live with  them in a cell--to Egypt, where the Pyramids become for him the  \"_twelve_ Barns of Joseph,\" for the legend had not yet insisted that the  actual number should be made to fit the text of the seven years of  plenty.    But with all this Antoninus now and then gives us glimpses of a larger  world. In Jerusalem he meets AEthiopians \"with nostrils slit and rings  about their fingers and their feet.\" They were so marked, they told him,  by the Emperor Trajan \"for a sign.\"    In the Sinai desert he tells us of \"Saracen\" beggars and idolaters; in  the Red Sea ports he sees \"ships from India\" laden with aromatics; he  travels up the Nile to the Cataracts and describes the Nilometer at  Assouan, and the crocodiles in the river; Alexandria he finds \"splendid  but frivolous, a lover of pilgrims but swarming with heresies.\"    But far more wonderful than the practical jumble of Antoninus Martyr is  the systematic nonsense of Cosmas, who invented or worked out a theory  and scheme of the world, a \"Christian topography,\" which required  nothing more than a complete disuse of human reason. His assurance was  equal to his science.    It may have been his voyage to India, or his monastic profession, or his  study of Scripture, or something unknown that made him take up the part  of a Christian Aristotle; in any case he felt himself called into the  field to support the cause of St. Augustine against infidelity, and to  refute the \"anile fable\" of the Antipodes. Cosmas referred men back to  Revelation on such matters, and his system was \"demonstrated from  Scripture, concerning which a Christian is not allowed to doubt.\" Man by  himself could not understand the world, but in the Bible it was all  clear enough. And from the Bible this much was beyond dispute.    The universe is a flat parallelogram; and its length is exactly double  of its breadth.

Thrice told ten happy years have danced along,        Since first to thee these wayworn limbs I gave;      Sweet smiling years, when both of us were young--        The kindest master, and the happiest slave!

But oh! kind Nature, take thy victim's life!        End thou a servant, feeble, old, and poor!      So shalt thou save me from the uplifted knife,        And gently stretch me at my master's door.          [Illustration: THE LEOPARD AND THE SERPENT.]    The Panther and Leopard.      Leopards and panthers are very similar in their appearance and habits;  so much so, that I shall introduce them both in the same chapter. The  engraving represents a panther. He is in some danger from the serpent  near him, I am inclined to think.    A panther is spoken of by an English lady, Mrs. Bowdich, who resided for  some time in Africa, as being thoroughly domesticated. He was as tame as  a cat, and much more affectionate than cats usually are. On one  occasion, when he was sick, the boy who had charge of him slept in his  den, and held the patient a great part of the time in his arms, and the  poor fellow appeared to be soothed by the care and attention of his  nurse. He had a great partiality for white people, probably because he  had been tamed by them; and the lady who gives this account of him was  his especial favorite. Twice each week she used to take him some  lavender water, which he was very fond of, and seized with great  eagerness. He allowed the children to play with him; and sometimes, when  he was sitting in the window, gazing upon what was going on below, the  little urchins would pull him down by the tail. It would seem to be  rather a dangerous experiment. But the panther let his play-fellows  enjoy the sport. I suppose he thought that though it was not very  pleasant to him, he would make the sacrifice of a little comfort rather  than to get angry and revenge himself. Besides, he might have said to  himself, \"These boys like the sport pretty well; I should guess it was  capital fun for them; it is a pity to rob them of their amusement it  does not hurt me much, and I will let it go; they don't mean any harm;  they are the kindest, best-natured children in the world; they would go  without their own dinner, any day, rather than see me suffer.\" If the  panther said this to himself, it was a very wise and sensible speech;  and if he did not say it, my little readers may consider me as the  author of it. I am satisfied, whether the panther has the credit of  making the remarks or whether I have it, so that my young friends get  the benefit of the lesson.    In their wild state these animals are very destructive. The same lady  who tells the story about the tame panther, says that in one case a  panther leaped through an open window near her residence, and killed a  little girl who happened to be the only occupant of the house at the  time, except a man who was asleep.    The tame leopard is often used in India for the purpose of hunting  antelopes. He is carried in a kind of small wagon, blindfolded, to the  place where the herd of antelopes are feeding. The reason they blindfold  him is to prevent his being too much in a hurry, so that he might make  choice of an animal which is not worth much. He does not fly at his prey  at once, when let loose, but, winding along carefully, conceals himself,  until an opportunity offers for his leap; and then, with five or six  bounds, made with amazing force and rapidity, overtakes the herd, and  brings his prey to the ground.    I have read a very serious story of an American panther. The lady, who  is the heroine of the story, and her husband, were among the first  settlers in the wilderness of one of our western states. They at first  lived in a log cabin. The luxury of glass was unknown in that wild place  among the forests, and consequently light and air were admitted through  holes which were always open. Both husband and wife had been away from  home for a day or two; and on their return, they found some deer's  flesh, which had been hanging up inside, partly eaten, and the tracks of  an animal, which the gentleman supposed were those of a large dog. He  was again obliged to leave home for a night, and this time the lady  remained in the house alone. She went to bed; and soon after, she heard  an animal climbing up the outside of the hut, and jump down through one  of the openings into the adjoining room, with which her sleeping  apartment was connected by a doorway without a door. Peeping out, she  saw a huge panther, apparently seeking for prey, and of course very  hungry and fierce. She beat against the partition between the rooms, and  screamed as loudly as she could, which so frightened the panther that he  jumped out. He was, however, soon in again, and a second time she  frightened him away in the same manner, when she sprang out of bed, and  went to the fire-place, in the hope of making a sufficient blaze to keep  the panther from entering again. But the embers were too much burned,  and would send out but a slight flame. What could the poor woman do? She  thought of getting under the bed; but then she reflected that the animal  would find no difficulty in getting at her in that situation, in which  case he would tear her in pieces before she could make any resistance.    The only plan which then occurred to her mind for perfect security, was  to get into a large sea-chest of her husband's, which was nearly empty.  Into that she accordingly crept. But there was danger of her being  smothered in this retreat; so she put her hand between the edge of the  chest and the lid, in order to keep the chest open a little, and admit  the air. Fortunately this lid hung over the side of the chest a little,  which saved her fingers. The panther soon came back again, as was  anticipated; and after snuffing about for some time, evidently  discovered where the lady was, and prowled round and round the chest,  licking and scratching the wood close to her fingers. There she lay,  scarcely daring to move, and listening intently to every movement of her  enemy. At last, he jumped on the top of the chest. His weight crushed  her fingers terribly; but she was brave enough to keep them where they  were, until the panther, tired of his fruitless efforts to get at her,  and finding nothing else to eat, finally retreated. She did not dare to  come out of the chest, however, until morning; for she feared, as long  as it was dark, that the beast might come back again. So there she sat,  ready to crouch down into her hiding-place, if she heard a noise from  her enemy. There she remained till after daylight. She was a heroine,  was she not?    A horse was killed one night by an American panther; but the body was  not disturbed until the next day, when some gentlemen living in the  vicinity, had an opportunity of watching the motions of the panther when  he returned to his prey. He seized the body of the horse with his teeth,  and drew it about sixty paces to a river, into which he plunged with his  prey, swam across with it, and drew it into a neighboring forest.    The American panther is very fond of fish, and instances have been known  of these animals catching trout with their paws. Humboldt says that he  saw a great many turtle shells which the panthers had robbed of the  flesh. The manner in which the panther performs this operation, this  traveler informs us, is to run with all speed when he sees a number of  turtles together on land, and to turn them, or as many of them as he can  catch before they reach the water, upon their backs, so that they cannot  escape, after which he feasts at his leisure.    Two children, a girl and a boy, were playing together near a small  Indian village, in the vicinity of a thicket, when a large panther came  out of the woods and made toward them, playfully bounding along, his  head down, and his back arched after the fashion of the cat when she  chooses to put on some of her mischievous airs. He came up to the boy,  and began to play with him, as the latter at first supposed, although he  was convinced of his mistake when the panther hit him so severe a blow  on his head as to draw blood. Then the little girl, who had a small  stick in her hand, struck the panther; and matters were going on in this  way, when some Indians in the village, hearing the cries of the  children, came to their rescue.    A gentleman who was formerly in the British service at Ceylon, relates  the following anecdote: \"I was at Jaffna, at the northern extremity of  the island of Ceylon, in the beginning of the year 1819, when, one  morning, my servant called me an hour or two before my usual time, with  'Master, master! people sent for master's dogs;"]]]
