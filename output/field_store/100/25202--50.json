She had made a place for herself  locally in temperance societies, and she decided that her work was  there--to make women an active, important part of this reform.    That winter, as a delegate of the Rochester Daughters of Temperance,  she went with high hopes to the state convention of the Sons of  Temperance in Albany, where she visited Lydia Mott and her sister  Abigail, who lived in a small house on Maiden Lane. Both Lydia and  Abigail, because of their independence, interested Susan greatly. They  supported themselves by \"taking in\" boarders from among the leading  politicians in Albany. They also kept a men's furnishings store on  Broadway and made hand-ruffled shirt bosoms and fine linen accessories  for Thurlow Weed, Horatio Seymour, and other influential citizens.  Their political contacts were many and important, and yet they were  also among the very few in that conservative city who stood for  temperance, abolition of slavery, and woman's rights. Their home was a  rallying point for reformers and a refuge for fugitive slaves. It was  to be a second home to Susan in the years to come.    When Susan and the other women delegates entered the convention of the  Sons of Temperance, they looked forward proudly, if a bit timidly, to  taking part in the meetings, but when Susan spoke to a motion, the  chairman, astonished that a woman would be so immodest as to speak in  a public meeting, scathingly announced, \"The sisters were not invited  here to speak, but to listen and to learn.\"[33]    This was the first time that Susan had been publicly rebuked because  she was a woman, and she did not take it lightly. Leaving the hall  with several other indignant women delegates, amid the critical  whisperings of those who remained \"to listen and to learn,\" she  hurried over to Lydia's shop to ask her advice on the next step to be  taken. Lydia, delighted that they had had the spirit to leave the  meeting, suggested they engage the lecture room of the Hudson Street  Presbyterian Church and hold a meeting of their own that very night.  She went with them to the office of her friend Thurlow Weed, the  editor of the _Evening Journal_, who published the whole story in his  paper.    [Illustration: Susan B. Anthony at the age of thirty-four]    Well in advance of the meeting, Susan was at the church, feeling very  responsible, and when she saw Samuel J. May enter, she was greatly  relieved. He had read the notice in the _Evening Journal_ and  persuaded a friend to come with him. To see his genial face in the  audience gave her confidence, for he would speak easily and well if  others should fail her. Only a few people drifted into the meeting,  for the night was snowy and cold. The room was poorly lighted, the  stove smoked, and in the middle of the speeches, the stovepipe fell  down. Yet in spite of all this, a spirit of independence and  accomplishment was born in that gathering and plans were made to call  a woman's state temperance convention in Rochester with Susan in  charge.    All this Susan reported to her new friend, Elizabeth Stanton, who  promised to help all she could, urging that the new organization lead  the way and not follow the advice of cautious, conservative women.  Susan agreed, and as a first step in carrying out this policy, she  asked Mrs. Stanton to make the keynote speech of the convention. Soon  the Woman's State Temperance Society was a going concern with Mrs.  Stanton as president and Susan as secretary. There was no doubt about  its leading the way far ahead of the rank and file of the temperance  movement when Mrs. Stanton, with Susan's full approval, recommended  divorce on the grounds of drunkenness, declaring, \"Let us petition our  State government so to modify the laws affecting marriage and the  custody of children that the drunkard shall have no claims on wife and  child.\"[34]    Such independence on the part of women could not be tolerated, and  both the press and the clergy ruthlessly denounced the Woman's State  Temperance Society. Susan, however, did not take this too seriously,  familiar as she was with the persecution antislavery workers endured  when they frankly expressed their convictions.           *       *       *       *       *    Now recognized as the leader of women's temperance groups in New York,  Susan traveled throughout the state, organizing temperance societies,  getting subscriptions for Amelia Bloomer's temperance paper, _The  Lily_, and attending temperance conventions in spite of the fact that  she met determined opposition to the participation of women. Impressed  by the success of political action in Maine, where in 1851 the first  prohibition law in the country had been passed, she now signed her  letters, \"Yours for Temperance Politics.\"[35] She appealed to women to  petition for a Maine law for New York and brought a group of women  before the legislature for the first time for a hearing on this  prohibition bill. Realizing then that women's indirect influence could  be of little help in political action, she saw clearly that women  needed the vote.    However, it was the woman's rights convention in Syracuse, New York,  in September 1852, which turned her thoughts definitely in the  direction of votes for women. It was the first woman's rights  gathering she had ever attended and she was enthusiastic over the  people she met. She talked eagerly with the courageous Jewish  lecturer, Ernestine Rose; with Dr. Harriot K. Hunt of Boston, one of  the first women physicians, who was waging a battle against taxation  without representation; with Clarina Nichols of Vermont, editor of  the _Windham County Democrat_, and with Matilda Joslyn Gage, the  youngest member of the convention. All of these became valuable, loyal  friends in the years ahead. Susan renewed her acquaintance with Lucy  Stone, and met Antoinette Brown who had also studied at Oberlin  College and was now the first woman ordained as a minister. With real  pleasure she greeted Mrs. Stanton's cousin, Gerrit Smith, now  Congressman from New York, and his daughter, Elizabeth Smith Miller,  the originator of the much-discussed bloomer. Best of all was her  long-hoped-for meeting with James and Lucretia Mott and Lucretia's  sister, Martha C. Wright. Only Paulina Wright Davis of Providence and  Elizabeth Oakes Smith of Boston were disappointing, for they appeared  at the meetings in short-sleeved, low-necked dresses with  loose-fitting jackets of pink and blue wool, shocking her deeply  intrenched Quaker instincts. Although she realized that they wore  ultrafashionable clothes to show the world that not all woman's rights  advocates were frumps wearing the hideous bloomer, she could not  forgive them for what to her seemed bad taste. How could such women,  she asked herself, hope to represent the earnest, hard-working women  who must be the backbone of the equal rights movement? Always  forthright, when a principle was at stake, she expressed her feelings  frankly when James Mott, serving with her on the nominating committee,  proposed Elizabeth Oakes Smith for president. His reply, that they  must not expect all women to dress as plainly as the Friends, in no  way quieted her opposition. To her delight, Lucretia Mott was elected,  and her dignity and poise as president of this large convention of  2,000 won the respect even of the critical press. Susan was elected  secretary and so clearly could her voice be heard as she read the  minutes and the resolutions that the Syracuse _Standard_ commented,  \"Miss Anthony has a capital voice and deserves to be clerk of the  Assembly.\"[36]    [Illustration: James and Lucretia Mott]    Not all of the newspapers were so friendly. Some labeled the gathering  \"a Tomfoolery convention\" of \"Aunt Nancy men and brawling women\";  others called it \"the farce at Syracuse,\"[37] but for Susan it marked  a milestone. Never before had she heard so many earnest, intelligent  women plead so convincingly for property rights, civil rights, and the  ballot. Never before had she seen so clearly that in a republic women  as well as men should enjoy these rights. The ballot assumed a new  importance for her. Her conversion to woman suffrage was complete.           *       *       *       *       *    This new interest in the vote was steadily nurtured by Elizabeth  Stanton, whom Susan now saw more frequently. Whenever she could, Susan  stopped over in Seneca Falls for a visit. Here she found inspiration,  new ideas, and good advice, and always left the comfortable Stanton  home ready to battle for the rights of women. While Susan traveled  about, organizing temperance societies and attending conventions, Mrs.  Stanton, tied down at home by a family of young children, wrote  letters and resolutions for her and helped her with her speeches.  Susan was very reluctant about writing speeches or making them. The  moment she sat down to write, her thoughts refused to come and her  phrases grew stilted. She needed encouragement, and Mrs. Stanton gave  it unstintingly, for she had grown very fond of this young woman whose  mental companionship she found so stimulating.    During one of these visits, Susan finally put on the bloomer and cut  her long thick brown hair as part of the stern task of winning  freedom for women. It was not an easy decision and she came to it only  because she was unwilling to do less for the cause than Mrs. Stanton  or Lucy Stone. Comfortable as the new dress was, it always attracted  unfavorable attention and added fuel to the fire of an unfriendly  press. This fire soon scorched her at the World's Temperance  convention in New York, where women delegates faced the determined  animosity of the clergy, who held the balance of power and quoted the  Bible to prove that women were defying the will of God when they took  part in public meetings. Obliged to withdraw, the women held meetings  of their own in the Broadway Tabernacle, over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#9)"],[1," time was cut up into  feudal territorial divisions of all sizes, from the principality, or the  prince-bishopric, to the knightly manor. Every few miles, and sometimes  less, there was a fresh territory, a fresh lord, and a fresh  jurisdiction.          CHAPTER I    THE REFORMATION MOVEMENT      The \"great man\" theory of history, formerly everywhere prevalent, and  even now common among non-historical persons, has long regarded the  Reformation as the purely personal work of the Augustine monk who was  its central figure. The fallacy of this conception is particularly  striking in the case of the Reformation. Not only was it preceded by  numerous sporadic outbursts of religious revivalism which sometimes  took the shape of opposition to the dominant form of Christianity,  though it is true they generally shaded off into mere movements of  independent Catholicism within the Church; but there were in addition  at least two distinct religious movements which led up to it, while  much which, under the reformers of the sixteenth century, appears as a  distinct and separate theology, is traceable in the fourteenth and  fifteenth centuries in the mystical movement connected with the names  of Meister Eckhart and Tauler. Meister Eckhart, whose free treatment  of Christian doctrines, in order to bring them into consonance with  his mystical theology, had drawn him into conflict with the Papacy,  undoubtedly influenced Luther through his disciple, Tauler, and  especially through the book which proceeded from the latter's school,  the _Deutsche Theologie_. It is, however, in the much more important  movement, which originated with Wyclif and extended to Central Europe  through Huss, that we must look for the more obvious influences  determining the course of religious development in Germany.    The Wyclifite movement in England was less a doctrinal heterodoxy than  a revolt against the Papacy and the priestly hierarchy. Mere  theoretical speculations were seldom interfered with, but anything  which touched their material interests at once aroused the vigilance  of the clergy. It is noticeable that the diffusion of Lollardism, that  is of the ideas of Wyclif, if not the cause of, was at least followed  by the peasant rising under the leadership of John Ball, a connection  which is also visible in the Tziska revolt following the Hussite  movement, and the Peasants' War in Germany which came on the heels of  the Lutheran Reformation. How much Huss was directly influenced by the  teachings of Wyclif is clear. The works of the latter were widely  circulated throughout Europe; for one of the advantages of the custom  of writing in Latin, which was universal during the Middle Ages, was  that books of an important character were immediately current amongst  all scholars without having, as now, to wait upon the caprice and  ability of translators. Huss read Wyclif's works as the preparation  for his theological degree, and subsequently made them his text-books  when teaching at the University of Prague. After his treacherous  execution at Constance, and the events which followed thereupon in  Bohemia, a number of Hussite fugitives settled in Southern Germany,  carrying with them the seeds of the new doctrines. An anonymous  contemporary writer states that \"to John Huss and his followers are to  be traced almost all those false principles concerning the power of  the spiritual and temporal authorities and the possession of earthly  goods and rights which before in Bohemia, and now with us, have called  forth revolt and rebellion, plunder, arson, and murder, and have  shaken to its foundations the whole commonwealth. The poison of these  false doctrines has been long flowing from Bohemia into Germany, and  will produce the same desolating consequences wherever it spreads.\"    The condition of the Catholic Church, against which the Reformation  movement generally was a protest, needs here to be made clear to the  reader. The beginning of clerical disintegration is distinctly visible  in the first half of the fourteenth century. The interdicts, as an  institution, had ceased to be respected, and the priesthood itself  began openly to sink itself in debauchery and to play fast and loose  with the rites of the Church. Indulgences for a hundred years were  readily granted for a consideration. The manufacture of relics became  an organized branch of industry; and festivals of fools and festivals  of asses were invented by the jovial priests themselves in travesty of  sacred mysteries, as a welcome relaxation from the monotony of  prescribed ecclesiastical ceremony. Pilgrimages increased in number  and frequency; new saints were created by the dozen; and the disbelief  of the clergy in the doctrines they professed was manifest even to the  most illiterate, whilst contempt for the ceremonies they practised was  openly displayed in the performance of their clerical functions. An  illustration of this is the joke of the priests related by Luther, who  were wont during the celebration of the Mass, when the worshippers  fondly imagined that the sacred formula of transubstantiation was  being repeated, to replace the words _Panis es et carnem fiebis_,  \"Bread thou art and flesh thou shalt become,\" by _Panis es et panis  manebis_, \"Bread thou art and bread thou shalt remain.\"    The scandals as regards clerical manners, growing, as they had been,  for many generations, reached their climax in the early part of the  sixteenth century. It was a common thing for priests to drive a  roaring trade as moneylenders, landlords of alehouses and gambling  dens, and even in some cases, brothel-keepers. Papal ukases had proved  ineffective to stem the current of clerical abuses. The regular clergy  evoked even more indignation than the secular. \"Stinking cowls\" was a  favourite epithet for the monks. Begging, cheating, shameless  ignorance, drunkenness, and debauchery, are alleged as being their  noted characteristics. One of the princes of the empire addresses a  prior of a convent largely patronized by aristocratic ladies as \"Thou,  our common brother-in-law!\" In some of the convents of Friesland,  promiscuous intercourse between the sexes was, it is said, quite  openly practised, the offspring being reared as monks and nuns. The  different orders competed with each other for the fame and wealth to  be obtained out of the public credulity. A fraud attempted by the  Dominicans at Bern, in 1506, _with the concurrence of the heads of the  order throughout Germany_, was one of the main causes of that city  adopting the Reformation.    In addition to the increasing burdens of investitures, annates, and  other Papal dues, the brunt of which the German people had directly or  indirectly to bear, special offence was given at the beginning of the  sixteenth century by the excessive exploitation of the practice of  indulgences by Leo X for the purpose of completing the cathedral of  St. Peter's at Rome. It was this, coming on the top of the exactions  already rendered necessary by the increasing luxury and debauchery of  the Papal Court and those of the other ecclesiastical dignitaries,  that directly led to the dramatic incidents with which the Lutheran  Reformation opened.    The remarkable personality with which the religious side of the  Reformation is pre-eminently associated was a child of his time, who  had passed through a variety of mental struggles, and had already  broken through the bonds of the old ecclesiasticism before that  turning-point in his career which is usually reckoned the opening of  the Reformation, to wit--the nailing of the theses on to the door of  the Schloss-Kirche in Wittenberg on the 31st of October, 1517. Martin  Luther, we must always bear in mind, however, was no Protestant in the  English Puritan sense of the word. It was not merely that he retained  much of what would be deemed by the old-fashioned English Protestant  \"Romish error\" in his doctrine, but his practical view of life showed  a reaction from the ascetic pretensions which he had seen bred nothing  but hypocrisy and the worst forms of sensual excess. It is, indeed,  doubtful if the man who sang the praises of \"Wine, Women, and Song\"  would have been deemed a fit representative in Parliament or elsewhere  by the British Nonconformist conscience of our day; or would be  acceptable in any capacity to the grocer-deacon of our provincial  towns, who, not content with being allowed to sand his sugar and  adulterate his tea unrebuked, would socially ostracise every one whose  conduct did not square with his conventional shibboleths. Martin  Luther was a child of his time also as a boon companion. The freedom  of his living in the years following his rupture with Rome was the  subject of severe animadversions on the part of the noble, but in this  respect narrow-minded, Thomas Muenzer, who, in his open letter  addressed to the \"Soft-living flesh of Wittenberg,\" scathingly  denounces what he deems his debauchery.    It does not enter into our province here to discuss at length the  religious aspects of the Reformation; but it is interesting to note  in passing the more than modern liberality of Luther's views with  respect to the marriage question and the celibacy of the clergy,  contrasted with the strong mediaeval flavour of his belief in  witchcraft and sorcery. In his _De Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae_  (1519) he expresses the view that if, for any cause, husband or wife  are prevented from having sexual intercourse they are justified, the  woman equally with the man, in seeking it elsewhere. He was opposed to  divorce, though he did not forbid it, and recommended that a man  should rather have a plurality of wives than that he should put away  any of them. Luther held strenuously the view that marriage was a  purely external contract for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, and  in no way entered into the spiritual life of the man. On this ground  he sees no"]]]
