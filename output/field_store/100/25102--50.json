Huc cum se consuetudine  reclinaverunt, infirmas arbores pondere adfligunt atque una ipsae  concidunt.      28    Tertium est genus eorum, qui uri appellantur. Hi sunt magnitudine paulo  infra elephantos, specie et colore et figura tauri. Magna vis eorum est  et magna velocitas, neque homini neque ferae quam conspexerunt parcunt.  Hos studiose foveis captos interficiunt. Hoc se labore durant  adulescentes atque hoc genere venationis exercent, et qui plurimos ex  his interfecerunt, relatis in publicum cornibus, quae sint testimonio,  magnam ferunt laudem. Sed adsuescere ad homines et mansuefieri ne  parvuli quidem excepti possunt. Amplitudo cornuum et figura et species  multum a nostrorum boum cornibus differt. Haec studiose conquisita ab  labris argento circumcludunt atque in amplissimis epulis pro poculis  utuntur.      29    Caesar, postquam per Vbios exploratores comperit Suebos sese in silvas  recepisse, inopiam frumenti veritus, quod, ut supra demonstravimus,  minime omnes Germani agriculturae student, constituit non progredi  longius; sed, ne omnino metum reditus sui barbaris tolleret atque ut  eorum auxilia tardaret, reducto exercitu partem ultimam pontis, quae  ripas Vbiorum contingebat, in longitudinem pedum ducentorum rescindit  atque in extremo ponte turrim tabulatorum quattuor constituit  praesidiumque cohortium duodecim pontis tuendi causa ponit magnisque eum  locum munitionibus firmat. Ei loco praesidioque Gaium Volcatium Tullum  adulescentem praefecit. Ipse, cum maturescere frumenta inciperent, ad  bellum Ambiorigis profectus per Arduennam silvam, quae est totius  Galliae maxima atque ab ripis Rheni finibusque Treverorum ad Nervios  pertinet milibusque amplius quingentis in longitudinem patet, Lucium  Minucium Basilum cum omni equitatu praemittit, si quid celeritate  itineris atque opportunitate temporis proficere possit; monet, ut ignes  in castris fieri prohibeat, ne qua eius adventus procul significatio  fiat: sese confestim subsequi dicit.      30    Basilus, ut imperatum est, facit. Celeriter contraque omnium opinionem  confecto itinere multos in agris inopinantes deprehendit: eorum indicio  ad ipsum Ambiorigem contendit, quo in loco cum paucis equitibus esse  dicebatur. Multum cum in omnibus rebus tum in re militari potest  fortuna. Nam magno accidit casu ut in ipsum incautum etiam atque  imparatum incideret, priusque eius adventus ab omnibus videretur, quam  fama ac nuntius adferretur: sic magnae fuit fortunae omni militari  instrumento, quod circum se habebat, erepto, raedis equisque  comprehensis ipsum effugere mortem. Sed hoc quoque factum est, quod  aedificio circumdato silva, ut sunt fere domicilia Gallorum, qui vitandi  aestus causa plerumque silvarum atque fluminum petunt propinquitates,  comites familiaresque eius angusto in loco paulisper equitum nostrorum  vim sustinuerunt. His pugnantibus illum in equum quidam ex suis intulit:  fugientem silvae texerunt. Sic et ad subeundum periculum et ad vitandum  multum fortuna valuit.      31    Ambiorix copias suas iudicione non conduxerit, quod proelio dimicandum  non existimarit, an tempore exclusus et repentino equitum adventu  prohibitus, cum reliquum exercitum subsequi crederet, dubium est. Sed  certe dimissis per agros nuntiis sibi quemque consulere iussit. Quorum  pars in Arduennam silvam, pars in continentes paludes profugit; qui  proximi Oceano fuerunt, his insulis sese occultaverunt, quas aestus  efficere consuerunt: multi ex suis finibus egressi se suaque omnia  alienissimis crediderunt. Catuvolcus, rex dimidiae partis Eburonum, qui  una cum Ambiorige consilium inierat, aetate iam confectus, cum laborem  aut belli aut fugae ferre non posset, omnibus precibus detestatus  Ambiorigem, qui eius consilii auctor fuisset, taxo, cuius magna in  Gallia Germaniaque copia est, se exanimavit.      32    Segni Condrusique, ex gente et numero Germanorum, qui sunt inter  Eburones Treverosque, legatos ad Caesarem miserunt oratum, ne se in  hostium nurnero duceret neve omnium Germanorum, qui essent citra Rhenum,  unam esse causam iudicaret: nihil se de bello cogitavisse, nulla  Ambiorigi auxilia misisse. Caesar explorata re quaestione captivorum, si  qui ad eos Eburones ex fuga convenissent, ad se ut reducerentur,  imperavit; si ita fecissent, fines eorum se violaturum negavit. Tum  copiis in tres partes distributis impedimenta omnium legionum Aduatucam  contulit. Id castelli nomen est. Hoc fere est in mediis Eburonum  finibus, ubi Titurius atque Aurunculeius hiemandi causa consederant.  Hunc cum reliquis rebus locum probabat, tum quod superioris anni  munitiones integrae manebant, ut militum laborem sublevaret. Praesidio  impedi mentis legionem quartamdecimam reliquit, unam ex eis tribus, quas  proxime conscriptas ex Italia traduxerat. Ei legioni castrisque Quintum  Tullium Ciceronem praeficit ducentosque equites attribuit.      33    Partito exercitu Titum Labienum cum legionibus tribus ad Oceanum versus  in eas partes quae Menapios attingunt proficisci iubet; Gaium Trebonium  cum pari legionum numero ad eam regionem quae ad Aduatucos adiacet  depopulandam mittit; ipse cum reliquis tribus ad flumen Scaldem, quod  influit in Mosam, extremasque Arduennae partis ire constituit, quo cum  paucis equitibus profectum Ambiorigem audiebat. Discedens post diem  septimum sese reversurum confirmat; quam ad diem ei legioni quae in  praesidio relinquebatur deberi frumentum sciebat. Labienum Treboniumque  hortatur, si rei publicae commodo facere possint, ad eum diem  revertantur, ut rursus communicato consilio exploratisque hostium  rationibus aliud initium belli capere possint.      34    Erat, ut supra demonstravimus, manus certa nulla, non oppidum, non  praesidium, quod se armis defenderet, sed in omnes partes dispersa  multitudo. Vbi cuique aut valles abdita aut locus silvestris aut palus  impedita spem praesidi aut salutis aliquam offerebat, consederat. Haec  loca vicinitatibus erant nota, magnamque res diligentiam requirebat non  in summa exercitus tuenda (nullum enim poterat universis perterritis ac  dispersis periculum accidere), sed in singulis militibus conservandis;  quae tamen ex parte res ad salutem exercitus pertinebat. Nam et praedae  cupiditas multos longius evocabat, et silvae incertis occultisque  itineribus confertos adire prohibebant. Si negotium confici stirpemque  hominum sceleratorum interfici vellet, dimittendae plures manus  diducendique erant milites; si continere ad signa manipulos vellet, ut  instituta ratio et consuetudo exercitus Romani postulabat, locus ipse  erat praesidio barbaris, neque ex occulto insidiandi et dispersos  circumveniendi singulis deerat audacia. Vt in eiusmodi difficultatibus,  quantum diligentia provideri poterat providebatur, ut potius in nocendo  aliquid praetermitteretur, etsi omnium animi ad ulciscendum ardebant,  quam cum aliquo militum detrimento noceretur. Dimittit ad finitimas  civitates nuntios Caesar: omnes ad se vocat spe praedae ad diripiendos  Eburones, ut potius in silvis Gallorum vita quam legionarius miles  periclitetur, simul ut magna multitudine circumfusa pro tali facinore  stirps ac nomen civitatis tollatur. Magnus undique numerus celeriter  convenit.      35    Haec in omnibus Eburonum partibus gerebantur, diesque appetebat  septimus, quem ad diem Caesar ad impedimenta legionemque reverti  constituerat. Hic quantum in bello fortuna possit et quantos adferat  casus cognosci potuit. Dissipatis ac perterritis hostibus, ut  demonstravimus, manus erat nulla quae parvam modo causam timoris  adferret. Trans Rhenum ad Germanos pervenit fama, diripi Eburones atque  ultro omnes ad praedam evocari. Cogunt equitum duo milia Sugambri, qui  sunt proximi Rheno, a quibus receptos ex fuga Tencteros atque Vsipetes  supra docuimus. Transeunt Rhenum navibus ratibusque triginta milibus  passuum infra eum locum, ubi pons erat perfectus praesidiumque ab  Caesare relictum: primos Eburonum fines adeunt; multos ex fuga dispersos  excipiunt, magno pecoris numero, cuius sunt cupidissimi barbari,  potiuntur. Invitati praeda longius procedunt. Non hos palus in bello  latrociniisque natos, non silvae morantur. Quibus in locis sit Caesar ex  captivis quaerunt; profectum longius reperiunt omnemque exercitum  discessisse cognoscunt. Atque unus ex captivis \"Quid vos,\" inquit, \"hanc  miseram ac tenuem sectamini praedam, quibus licet iam esse  fortunatissimos? Tribus horis Aduatucam venire potestis: huc omnes suas  fortunas exercitus Romanorum contulit: praesidi tantum est, ut ne murus  quidem cingi possit, neque quisquam egredi extra munitiones audeat.\"  Oblata spe Germani quam nacti erant praedam in occulto relinquunt; ipsi  Aduatucam contendunt usi eodem duce, cuius haec indicio cognoverant.      36    Cicero, qui omnes superiores dies praeceptis Caesaris cum summa  diligentia milites in castris continuisset ac ne calonem quidem quemquam  extra munitionem egredi passus esset, septimo die diffidens de numero  dierum Caesarem fidem servaturum, quod longius progressum audiebat,  neque ulla de reditu eius fama adferebatur, simul eorum permotus  vocibus, qui illius patientiam paene obsessionem appellabant, siquidem  ex castris egredi non liceret, nullum eiusmodi casum exspectans, quo  novem oppositis legionibus maximoque equitatu dispersis ac paene deletis  hostibus in milibus passuum tribus offendi posset, quinque cohortes  frumentatum in proximas segetes mittit, quas inter et castra unus omnino  collis intererat. Complures erant ex legionibus aegri relicti; ex quibus  qui hoc spatio dierum convaluerant, circiter CCC, sub vexillo una  mittuntur; magna praeterea multitudo calonum, magna vis iumentorum, quae  in castris subsederant, facta potestate sequitur.      37    Hoc ipso tempore et casu Germani equites interveniunt protinusque eodem  illo, quo venerant, cursu ab decumana porta in castra irrumpere  conantur, nec prius sunt visi obiectis ab ea parte silvis, quam"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18843"],[0,"Applied Psychology for Nurses (#9)"],[1," have lived a lifetime, where we  have left everything that has been brought into it since our birth. It  would be piled ceiling high, with no room for us, and with difficulty  only could we find what we want. As we grow from babyhood to childhood,  from childhood to youth, from youth to maturity the room changes with  us. We put off childish things. They are stored away somewhere, in an  attic or basement, or destroyed. And day after day something new is  added, displacing something else. In the case of the mind all these  things are stored and cataloged in the subconscious, and forgotten,  until some need causes us to look into our catalog-index and see the  experience again, or some association calls it back, relating it to  something new. So our discussion of the subconscious involved also a  discussion of memory.    But what of the things we must use frequently and cannot find in our  minds? What of absent-mindedness and faulty memory? In such cases our  minds might be compared to a cluttered room full of things we need and  want to use every day, but in confusion. We know where many of them are,  the ones we care most about; but we have to rummage wildly to find the  rest. We have no proper system of arrangement of our belongings. You  laid down that book somewhere, absent-mindedly, and now you cannot tell  where. You were thinking of something else at the time, and inattention  proves a most common cause of poor memory. Perhaps you simply have more  books than the room can hold in an orderly way, and so you crowded that  one in some corner, and now have no recollection of where you put it.    Poor memory is the result of lack of attention, or divided attention at  the time the particular attention-stimulus knocked. You asked me to buy  a ribbon of a certain shade and a certain width when I went to town. I  was thinking of my dentist appointment. However, I heard your request,  answered it graciously, took the money you offered, still wondering if  the dentist would have to draw that tooth. And the chances are that I  forgot your ribbon. I was giving you only a passive and divided  attention.    Or I have more to do than I can possibly accomplish in the next six  hours. You ask me to buy the ribbon. I attend accurately for the moment,  think distractedly, \"How can I do it all?--but I will\"--and crowd the  intention into an already overburdened corner of my mind, fail to  associate it with the other thoughts already there, and return six hours  later without the ribbon. My sense of hurry, of stress, of the more  important thing to be done, or a reaction of impatience at the request,  forced back the ribbon thought and allowed it to be hidden by others. I  was really giving you only partial attention, or an emotion interfered  with attention; and I forgot.    Hence we find that a faulty memory may exist in an otherwise normal mind  when poor attention, or divided attention due to emotional stress or to  an overcrowded mind, which makes it impossible to properly assort its  material, interferes.    Again, we forget many things because they are unpleasant to remember. We  have no desire, no emotional stimulus to make us remember; or because  some of the associations with the forgotten incident are undesirable.  We forget many things because if we remembered them we would feel called  upon to do some unpleasant duty. You forgot your tennis engagement with  B, perhaps, because you were so engrossed in a pleasure at hand, or in  your work, that anything which interrupted was, under the circumstances,  undesirable. You may have wanted very much to play with him, but some  more pressing desire--to care well for your patient, or to continue the  present amusement--was stronger. Or you forgot because you did not want  to play with him and had no excuse to offer at the time. You wished to  forget. Perhaps he does not play a good game, or you do not like him, or  at least you like some one else much more, and he happened along; so you  forgot B. The unconscious mind saw to it that something else was kept so  prominently before your attention that it could not return to the less  desired.    Thus a forgetting may be purely the result of an emotional interference  which makes it, all in all, more pleasant to forget than to remember. If  we would help ourselves or our patients whose memories are faulty, and  who make them worse by their continual fretting over their disability,  we must train ourselves to be willing to forget all that does not in the  least concern our interests or those of the people about us, and does  not add anything desirable to our knowledge. Thus we may avoid  overcrowding the mind. But when we would remember let us give our whole  active attention at the moment of presentation of the new stimulus, and  immediately tie it up with something in past experience; let us  recognize what it is that we should remember, and call the reinforcement  of will, which demands that we remember whether we want to or not.  Sincere desire to remember will inspire early and frequent recalling,  with various associations, or hooks, until the impression becomes  permanent. The average patient's poor memory is made worse by his  agitation and attention to it, and his conviction that he cannot  remember. The fear of forgetting often wastes mental energy which might  otherwise provide keenness of memory. If the nurse ties up some pleasant  association with the things she wants the sick man to remember, and  disregards his painful effort to recall other things, then--unless the  mind is disordered--he will often find normal memory reasserting itself.    We shall consider this question of memory in more detail in a later  chapter of practical suggestions for the nurse.      THE PLACE OF EMOTION    _Feeling Cannot Be Separated from Thinking._--Emotion we found the  constant accompaniment of every other mental activity. It is first on  the stage of consciousness and, in the normal mind, last to withdraw.    When I am working at a problem in doses or solutions, trying to learn my  _materia medica_, or wrestling with the causes of disease in my  _medical nursing_, or thinking how I can eke out my last ten dollars  till I get some more, I am pursued with some vague or well-defined  feeling of annoyance or satisfaction, of displeasure or pleasure. If all  goes well, the latter; if not, the former.    _Feeling Cannot Be Separated from Will._--I cannot _will_ without a  feeling accompaniment, pleasant or unpleasant. I may be using my will  only in carrying out what intellect advises. But we found that  intellect's operations are always affective, _i. e._, have some feeling  of pleasure or pain. And the very act of will itself is a pleasant one  and much easier if it is making me do what I want to do; it is a vaguely  or actively unpleasant one if it is making me act against desire. In the  end, however, if I act against desire in pursuance of reason or a sense  of duty, the feeling of pleasure in the victory of my better self is  asserted. And feeling cannot be separated from will.    _Feeling Cannot Be Separated from Action._--I cannot do anything without  a feeling of comfort or discomfort, happiness or unhappiness. Try it for  yourself when you are feeding a patient, making a bed, giving a bath or  massage, preparing a hypodermic. Other things being normal, if you are  performing the task perfectly, the feeling of satisfaction, of pleasure,  of the very ability to work effectively, with speed and accuracy and  nicety, comes with the doing. If you are bungling, there is a pervading  sense of dissatisfaction, of unpleasantness. In the automatic or  semi-automatic action a great economy of nature has conservatively put  feeling at the absolute minimum; but it has not eradicated it. As you  walk across the ward, though your predominating thought and feeling may  be elsewhere, there is a sense of pleasure or displeasure in the very  movement. If your body is fresh and you are of an energetic type and in  happy frame of mind, a pervasive feeling of satisfaction is experienced.  If tired or discouraged or sore from unaccustomed exercise, every step  registers protest.    Thus we find by experiment that there is no thought we have, no single  conscious movement or action, nor any expression of the will, but is  accompanied with what the psychologist broadly terms _pleasure_ or  _pain_. So _emotion_, the first expression of mentality, is never absent  from any mental or physical act. It permeates all we do, as well as all  we think and will, with the partial exception of automatic action, above  indicated.      THE BEGINNING OF REASON    We found feeling by far the strongest factor in producing action in  babyhood and childhood. Our instinctive doing, we learned, is the result  of a race impulse. Will acts chiefly at emotion's bidding. But very  early the baby's experience operates as a partial check to feeling's  exclusive sway. It keeps him from touching the fire, no matter how its  brightness attracts. It may be merely the sense memory of _hurt_ when  fingers and that bright thing came together; and one such impression  will probably prevent him from ever again touching it. Or it may be the  brain-cell's retention of the painful feeling of slapped hands when the  fingers reaching out to the flame had not yet quite touched. These  punishment experiences are only effective in many children after more or  less repetition has set up an automatic prohibition from brain to motor  nerves; but right here intellect begins to assert itself in the form of  sense memory. The baby does not reason about the matter. His nerve-cells  simply remember pain, and that particular brightness and glow, and  finger touch--or that reaching out to the glow--and slapped hands, as  occurring together. In the same way he early connects pleasure with the  taste of certain forbidden things. He does not know they are sweet. He  only knows \"I want.\" Even here his "]]]
