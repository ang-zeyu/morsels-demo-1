(#9)"],[1,"through the fire-bars of a furnace and coming in contact  with hot coke combines with it, forming a very hot mixture of carbonic  acid and nitrogen; this ascending, comes in contact with more coke, and  the carbonic acid is reduced to carbonic oxide; at the top of the  furnace, or in the flue, the carbonic oxide meeting fresh air, combines  with the oxygen therein and re-forms carbonic acid. In the first and  third of these reactions, much heat is evolved; in the second, the  furnace is cooled a little. It must always be remembered, that the  carbonic oxide of the furnace gases is a reducing agent. When these  gases are likely to exert a prejudicial effect, and a strongly oxidising  atmosphere is required, the work is best done in a _muffle_.    FOOTNOTES:    [3] There is an exception to this, as when the slag is liable to be  acted on when exposed to the air and to the gases of the furnace. In  this case a layer of fused common salt floating on the slag, so as to  protect it from the air and furnace gases, is a distinct advantage.          CHAPTER III.    WET GRAVIMETRIC METHODS.      In _dry assays_ the metal is almost always separated and weighed as  metal; in _wet_ gravimetric assays the metal is more usually weighed in  the form of a definite compound of known composition. The general  methods of working resemble those of ordinary chemical analysis, and  their successful working is greatly helped by a knowledge of, at any  rate, those compounds of the metal which enable it to be separated, and  of those which are the most convenient forms in which it can be weighed.  But the work of the assayer differs from that of the analyst, inasmuch  as the bulk of his estimations are made upon material of practically the  same kind, varying only in richness; consequently in assaying, it is  possible (and necessary) to work on such a definite plan as will involve  the least amount of labour in weighing and calculating.    The assayer connected with mining has generally two classes of material  to deal with: those comparatively rich and those comparatively poor. For  example, silver in bullion and in ores; copper precipitates or regulus,  and copper ores and slags; and \"black tin\" and tin ores. He is only  occasionally called on to assay the intermediate products. It is  indispensable that he should have an approximate knowledge of the  substance to be determined. With new ores this information is best got  by a qualitative testing. Knowing that only certain bodies are present,  it is evident that the number of separations can be reduced, and that  simple methods can be devised for arriving at the results sought for.  The best method is that which involves the least number of separations.  The reactions must be sharp and complete, and yet not be liable to error  under varying conditions.    To bring the richer and poorer materials under the same conditions for  the assay, a small weight, say 1 gram of the richer, and a larger weight  (5 or 10 grams) of the poorer, substance is weighed up. A method is then  adopted which will concentrate the whole of the metal (either during or  after solution) in a product which need not necessarily be pure. The  work on this product is comparatively easy. In separating small  quantities of a substance from a large bulk of impurities, the group  separations must not as a rule be too much relied on. Very large  precipitates carry down small quantities of bodies not belonging to the  group, more especially when there is a tendency to form weak double  compounds. The re-dissolving and re-precipitating of bulky precipitates  should be avoided.    When a large number of assays of the same kind have to be carried out, a  plan something like the following is adopted:--The samples, after having  been dried, are placed in order on a table at the left hand of the  assayer. He takes the first, marks it with a number, samples and weighs  up the quantity required, and transfers it to a flask, which is  similarly marked. As the weighings are finished, the samples are placed  in the same order on his right hand. The assistant takes the flasks in  batches of four or five at a time to the fume cupboard, where he adds a  measured quantity of acid. When solution has been effected, dilution  with a measured volume is generally necessary. The assayer sees to this  and (whilst the funnels and filters are being prepared) makes any  separation that is necessary. The filters are arranged in order on a  rack (fig. 11), and need not be marked unless the precipitates or  residues have subsequently to be dried. The filters are washed with hot  water, and if the filtrates are wanted flasks are placed beneath, if  not, the solution is drained off down the sink. Precipitation or  reduction (or whatever it may be) is now made; the assistant filters the  prepared samples, one at a time, whilst the assayer is engaged with the  others. The same style of work is continued until the assays are  completed. If one should be spoiled, it is better to allow it to stand  over for assaying along with the next batch. If one filters slowly or is  in any way less forward than the rest, it may lessen the accuracy of the  other assays, owing to oxidation, &c., it should, therefore, be put on  one side. The assays are dealt with in batches of ten or twenty, so that  a large quantity of work can be quickly finished.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    When the assays are finished, it is the duty of the assistant to clean  the apparatus (with reagents, if necessary), and to put the vessels in  the place set apart for them. Flasks are best kept inverted on a rack,  so that they may be dry and clean by the next morning. Berlin crucibles  must be cleaned and ignited.    The amount of apparatus employed should be as little as is feasible. The  assay should be carried out as much as possible in the same flask. The  bench must be clean, and altogether free from apparatus not in actual  use. Crucibles and dishes in which weighings are made should be marked  with numbers or letters; and their weights recorded, together with the  date of weighing, in a small ledger, which is kept in the drawer of the  balance. By this means a record of the \"wear\" of each piece of apparatus  is obtained, and, what is more important, much weighing is saved, and  increased confidence is gained. The weight of each piece of apparatus  need not be taken daily. It will be seen from the record in the book and  a knowledge of the use it has been put to how often a checking of the  weight is necessary. The entries are made in black lead as follows:--      Dish, A.  Feb. 3    9.4210 grams.                   5    9.4225                   6    9.4230                   7    9.4200    Platinum vessels and apparatus lose, and porcelain ones slightly gain,  weight with continued use.    The special details of the work is given under each assay; certain  general instructions will be given here.    ~Solution.~--It is not always necessary to get the whole of the mineral  in solution, provided the body sought for is either completely dissolved  or altogether left in the residue. It is often only by a qualitative  examination of the solution (or residue, as the case may be) that the  assayer can satisfy himself that it is free from the substance sought.  But previous experience with the same kind of ore will show to what  extent this testing is necessary.    Solution is generally best effected in flasks; but where the resulting  liquid has afterwards to be evaporated to dryness and ignited,  evaporating dishes (fig. 12) are used. With them clock glasses are used  as covers during solution to avoid loss through effervescence.  Evaporating dishes are also best when an insoluble residue has to be  collected, since it is difficult to wash out most residues from a flask.  Bumping occurs less frequently in dishes than in flasks.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    After the addition of the acid, and mixing by agitation, the vessel  containing the substance is heated. This is best done on the \"hot  plate\" (fig. 13). This consists of a slab of cast iron about half or  three-quarters of an inch thick, supported on loose fire bricks, and  heated by two or three ring burners (figs. 14 and 15). The burners are  connected to the gas supply by means of _lead_ tubing, to which they are  soldered. Flasks and dishes after being put on the plate are not further  handled until solution is complete or the evaporation is carried to  dryness. The hot plate is contained in a cupboard so as to be out of the  reach of cold draughts.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    The action of the acids and other solvents is described in the chapter  on Reagents.    ~Precipitation.~--In precipitating add sufficient of the reagent to  complete the reaction. The student must be on his guard against adding a  very large excess, which is the commoner error. In some reactions the  finishing point is obvious enough; either no more precipitate is formed,  or a precipitate is completely dissolved, or some well-marked colour or  odour is developed or removed.    In those cases in which there is no such indication, theoretical  considerations should keep the use of reagents within reasonable limits.  The solutions of the reagents (_see_ REAGENTS) are generally of five or  ten per cent. strength. A small excess over that demanded by theory  should be sufficient.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    ~Filtration.~--Solutions are best filtered hot whenever the assay allows  of this being so done. The precipitate should be allowed to settle, and  the clear liquid decanted on the filter with the aid of a glass rod if  necessary. The filter-paper must not be too large, but at the same time  it must not be overloaded with the precipitate. There should be ample  room for washing.

Obj. 2: Further, just as we are directed to God by faith, so are we  by charity. Now man is not bound to keep the precepts of charity, and  it is enough if he be ready to fulfil them: as is evidenced by the  precept of Our Lord (Matt. 5:39): \"If one strike thee on one [Vulg.:  'thy right'] cheek, turn to him also the other\"; and by others of the  same kind, according to Augustine's exposition (De Serm. Dom. in  Monte xix). Therefore neither is man bound to believe anything  explicitly, and it is enough if he be ready to believe whatever God  proposes to be believed.    Obj. 3: Further, the good of faith consists in obedience, according  to Rom. 1:5: \"For obedience to the faith in all nations.\" Now the  virtue of obedience does not require man to keep certain fixed  precepts, but it is enough that his mind be ready to obey, according  to Ps. 118:60: \"I am ready and am not troubled; that I may keep Thy  commandments.\" Therefore it seems enough for faith, too, that man  should be ready to believe whatever God may propose, without his  believing anything explicitly.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Heb. 11:6): \"He that cometh to God,  must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him.\"    _I answer that,_ The precepts of the Law, which man is bound to  fulfil, concern acts of virtue which are the means of attaining  salvation. Now an act of virtue, as stated above (I-II, Q. 60, A. 5)  depends on the relation of the habit to its object. Again two things  may be considered in the object of any virtue; namely, that which is  the proper and direct object of that virtue, and that which is  accidental and consequent to the object properly so called. Thus it  belongs properly and directly to the object of fortitude, to face the  dangers of death, and to charge at the foe with danger to oneself,  for the sake of the common good: yet that, in a just war, a man be  armed, or strike another with his sword, and so forth, is reduced to  the object of fortitude, but indirectly.    Accordingly, just as a virtuous act is required for the fulfilment of  a precept, so is it necessary that the virtuous act should terminate  in its proper and direct object: but, on the other hand, the  fulfilment of the precept does not require that a virtuous act should  terminate in those things which have an accidental or secondary  relation to the proper and direct object of that virtue, except in  certain places and at certain times. We must, therefore, say that the  direct object of faith is that whereby man is made one of the  Blessed, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 8): while the indirect and  secondary object comprises all things delivered by God to us in Holy  Writ, for instance that Abraham had two sons, that David was the son  of Jesse, and so forth.    Therefore, as regards the primary points or articles of faith, man is  bound to believe them, just as he is bound to have faith; but as to  other points of faith, man is not bound to believe them explicitly,  but only implicitly, or to be ready to believe them, in so far as he  is prepared to believe whatever is contained in the Divine  Scriptures. Then alone is he bound to believe such things explicitly,  when it is clear to him that they are contained in the doctrine of  faith.    Reply Obj. 1: If we understand those things alone to be in a man's  power, which we can do without the help of grace, then we are bound  to do many things which we cannot do without the aid of healing  grace, such as to love God and our neighbor, and likewise to believe  the articles of faith. But with the help of grace we can do this, for  this help \"to whomsoever it is given from above it is mercifully  given; and from whom it is withheld it is justly withheld, as a  punishment of a previous, or at least of original, sin,\" as Augustine  states (De Corr. et Grat. v, vi [*Cf. Ep. cxc; De Praed. Sanct.  viii.]).    Reply Obj. 2: Man is bound to love definitely those lovable things  which are properly and directly the objects of charity, namely, God  and our neighbor. The objection refers to those precepts of charity  which belong, as a consequence, to the objects of charity.    Reply Obj. 3: The virtue of obedience is seated, properly speaking,  in the will; hence promptness of the will subject to authority,  suffices for the act of obedience, because it is the proper and  direct object of obedience. But this or that precept is accidental  or consequent to that proper and direct object.  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 6]    Whether All Are Equally Bound to Have Explicit Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that all are equally bound to have  explicit faith. For all are bound to those things which are necessary  for salvation, as is evidenced by the precepts of charity. Now it is  necessary for salvation that certain things should be believed  explicitly. Therefore all are equally bound to have explicit faith.    Obj. 2: Further, no one should be put to test in matters that he is  not bound to believe. But simple persons are sometimes tested in  reference to the slightest articles of faith. Therefore all are  bound to believe everything explicitly.    Obj. 3: Further, if the simple are bound to have, not explicit but  only implicit faith, their faith must needs be implied in the faith  of the learned. But this seems unsafe, since it is possible for the  learned to err. Therefore it seems that the simple should also have  explicit faith; so that all are, therefore, equally bound to have  explicit faith.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Job 1:14): \"The oxen were  ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,\" because, as Gregory  expounds this passage (Moral. ii, 17), the simple, who are signified  by the asses, ought, in matters of faith, to stay by the learned, who  are denoted by the oxen.    _I answer that,_ The unfolding of matters of faith is the result of  Divine revelation: for matters of faith surpass natural reason. Now  Divine revelation reaches those of lower degree through those who are  over them, in a certain order; to men, for instance, through the  angels, and to the lower angels through the higher, as Dionysius  explains (Coel. Hier. iv, vii). In like manner therefore the unfolding  of faith must needs reach men of lower degree through those of higher  degree. Consequently, just as the higher angels, who enlighten those  who are below them, have a fuller knowledge of Divine things than the  lower angels, as Dionysius states (Coel. Hier. xii), so too, men of  higher degree, whose business it is to teach others, are under  obligation to have fuller knowledge of matters of faith, and to  believe them more explicitly.    Reply Obj. 1: The unfolding of the articles of faith is not equally  necessary for the salvation of all, since those of higher degree,  whose duty it is to teach others, are bound to believe explicitly  more things than others are.    Reply Obj. 2: Simple persons should not be put to the test about  subtle questions of faith, unless they be suspected of having been  corrupted by heretics, who are wont to corrupt the faith of simple  people in such questions. If, however, it is found that they are free  from obstinacy in their heterodox sentiments, and that it is due to  their simplicity, it is no fault of theirs.    Reply Obj. 3: The simple have no faith implied in that of the  learned, except in so far as the latter adhere to the Divine  teaching. Hence the Apostle says (1 Cor. 4:16): \"Be ye followers of  me, as I also am of Christ.\" Hence it is not human knowledge, but the  Divine truth that is the rule of faith: and if any of the learned  stray from this rule, he does not harm the faith of the simple ones,  who think that the learned believe aright; unless the simple hold  obstinately to their individual errors, against the faith of the  universal Church, which cannot err, since Our Lord said (Luke 22:32):  \"I have prayed for thee,\" Peter, \"that thy faith fail not.\"  _______________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 7]    Whether It Is Necessary for the Salvation of All, That They Should  Believe Explicitly in the Mystery of Christ?    Objection 1: It would seem that it is not necessary for the salvation  of all that they should believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ.  For man is not bound to believe explicitly what the angels are  ignorant about: since the unfolding of faith is the result of Divine  revelation, which reaches man by means of the angels, as stated above  (A. 6; I, Q. 111, A. 1). Now even the angels were in ignorance of the  mystery of the Incarnation: hence, according to the commentary of  Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii), it is they who ask (Ps. 23:8): \"Who is  this king of glory?\" and (Isa. 63:1): \"Who is this that cometh from  Edom?\" Therefore men were not bound to believe explicitly in the  mystery of Christ's Incarnation.    Obj. 2: Further, it is evident that John the Baptist was one of the  teachers, and most nigh to Christ, Who said of him (Matt. 11:11) that  \"there hath not risen among them that are born of women, a greater  than\" he. Now John the Baptist does not appear to have known the  mystery of Christ explicitly, since he asked Christ (Matt. 11:3):  \"Art Thou He that art to come, or look we for another?\" Therefore  even the teachers were not bound to explicit faith in Christ.    Obj. 3: Further, many gentiles obtained salvation through the  ministry of the angels, as Dionysius states (Coel. Hier. ix). Now it  would seem that the gentiles had neither explicit nor implicit faith  in Christ, since they received no revelation. Therefore it seems that  it was not necessary for the salvation of all to believe explicitly  in the mystery of Christ.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Corr. et Gratia vii; Ep. cxc):  \"Our faith is sound if we believe that no man, old or young is  delivered from the contagion of death and the bonds of sin, except  by the"]]]
