But there is one thing essential  to a dignified retreat. One must know the way out. It was that fact  which kept me standing there, looking more foolish than anyone has  ever looked since the world began. I could hardly ask to be conducted  off the premises like the honored guest. Nor would it do to retire by  the way I had come. If I could have leaped the hedge with a single  bound, that would have made a sufficiently dashing and debonair exit.  But the hedge was high, and I was incapable at the moment of achieving  a debonair leap over a footstool.    The man saved the situation. He seemed to possess that magnetic power  over his fellows which marks the born leader. Under his command we  became an organized army. The common object, the pursuit of the hen,  made us friends. In the first minute of the proceedings the Irishman  was addressing me as \"me dear boy,\" and the other man, who had  introduced himself rapidly as Tom Chase, lieutenant in his Majesty's  navy, was shouting directions to me by name. I have never assisted at  any ceremony at which formality was so completely dispensed with. The  ice was not merely broken, it was shivered into a million fragments.    \"Go in and drive her out, Garnet,\" shouted Mr. Chase. \"In my  direction, if you can. Look out on the left, Phyllis.\"    Even in that disturbing moment I could not help noticing his use of  the Christian name. It seemed to me sinister. I did not like the idea  of dashing young lieutenants in the royal navy calling a girl Phyllis  whose eyes had haunted me for just over a week--since, in fact, I had  first seen them. Nevertheless, I crawled into the bushes and dislodged  the hen. She emerged at the spot where Mr. Chase was waiting with his  coat off, and was promptly enveloped in that garment and captured.    \"The essence of strategy,\" observed Mr. Chase approvingly, \"is  surprise. A devilish neat piece of work.\"    I thanked him. He deprecated the thanks. He had, he said, only done  his duty, as a man is bound to do. He then introduced me to the  elderly Irishman, who was, it seemed, a professor--of what I do not  know--at Dublin University. By name, Derrick. He informed me that he  always spent the summer at Lyme Regis.    \"I was surprised to see you at Lyme Regis,\" I said. \"When you got out  at Yeovil, I thought I had seen the last of you.\"    I think I am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate  turning of sentences.    \"I meant,\" I added speedily, \"I was afraid I had.\"    \"Ah, of course,\" he said, \"you were in our carriage coming down. I was  confident I had seen you before. I never forget a face.\"    \"It would be a kindness,\" said Mr. Chase, \"if you would forget  Garnet's as now exhibited. You'll excuse the personality, but you  seem to have collected a good deal of the professor's property coming  through that hedge.\"    \"I was wondering,\" I said with gratitude. \"A wash--if I might?\"    \"Of course, me boy, of course,\" said the professor. \"Tom, take Mr.  Garnet off to your room, and then we'll have some lunch. You'll stay  to lunch, Mr. Garnet?\"    I thanked him for his kindness and went off with my friend, the  lieutenant, to the house. We imprisoned the hen in the stables, to its  profound indignation, gave directions for lunch to be served to it,  and made our way to Mr. Chase's room.    \"So you've met the professor before?\" he said, hospitably laying out a  change of raiment for me--we were fortunately much of a height and  build.    \"I have never spoken to him,\" I said. \"We traveled down together in a  very full carriage, and I saw him next day on the beach.\"    \"He's a dear old boy, if you rub him the right way.\"    \"Yes?\" I said.    \"But--I'm telling you this for your good and guidance--he can cut up  rough. And when he does, he goes off like a four point seven. I think,  if I were you--you don't mind my saying this?--I think, if I were you,  I should _not_ mention Mr. Tim Healy at lunch.\"    I promised that I would try to resist the temptation.    \"And if you _could_ manage not to discuss home rule--\"    \"I will make an effort.\"    \"On any other topic he will be delighted to hear your views. Chatty  remarks on bimetallism would meet with his earnest attention. A  lecture on what to do with the cold mutton would be welcomed. But not  Ireland, if you don't mind. Shall we go down?\"    We got to know one another very well at lunch.    \"Do you hunt hens,\" asked Mr. Chase, who was mixing the salad--he was  one of those men who seem to do everything a shade better than anyone  else, \"for amusement or by your doctor's orders?\"    \"Neither,\" I said, \"and particularly not for amusement. The fact is I  have been lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a  chicken farm--\"    I was interrupted. All three of them burst into laughter. Mr. Chase in  his emotion allowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth, missing  the salad bowl by a clear two inches.    \"You don't mean to tell us,\" he said, \"that you really come from the  one and only chicken farm?\"    I could not deny it.    \"Why, you're the man we've all been praying to meet for days past.  Haven't we, professor?\"    \"You're right, Tom,\" chuckled Mr. Derrick.    \"We want to know all about it, Mr. Garnet,\" said Phyllis Derrick.    \"Do you know,\" continued Mr. Chase, \"that you are the talk of the  town? Everybody is discussing you. Your methods are quite new and  original, aren't they?\"    \"Probably,\" I replied. \"Ukridge knows nothing about fowls. I know  less. He considers it an advantage. He said our minds ought to be  unbiased by any previous experience.\"    \"Ukridge!\" said the professor. \"That was the name old Dawlish, the  grocer, said. I never forget a name. He is the gentleman who lectures  on the breeding of poultry, is he not? You do not?\"    I hastened to disclaim any such feat.    \"His lectures are very popular,\" said Phyllis with a little splutter  of mirth.    \"He enjoys them,\" I said.    \"Look here, Garnet,\" said Mr. Chase, \"I hope you won't consider all  these questions impertinent, but you've no notion of the thrilling  interest we all take--at a distance--in your farm. We have been  talking of nothing else for a week. I have dreamed of it three nights  running. Is Mr. Ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation, or is  he an eccentric millionaire?\"    \"He's not a millionaire. I believe he intends to be, though, before  long, with the assistance of the fowls. But I hope you won't look on  me as in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm. I am  merely a laborer. The brain work of the business lies in Ukridge's  department.\"    \"Tell me, Mr. Garnet,\" said Phyllis, \"do you use an incubator?\"    \"Oh, yes, we have an incubator.\"    \"I suppose you find it very useful?\"    \"I'm afraid we use it chiefly for drying our boots when they get wet,\"  I said.    Only that morning Ukridge's spare pair of tennis shoes had permanently  spoiled the future of half-a-dozen eggs which were being hatched on  the spot where the shoes happened to be placed. Ukridge had been quite  annoyed.    \"I came down here principally,\" I said, \"in search of golf. I was told  there were links, but up to the present my professional duties have  monopolized me.\"    \"Golf,\" said Professor Derrick. \"Why, yes. We must have a round or two  together. I am very fond of golf. I generally spend the summer down  here improving my game.\"    I said I should be delighted.           *       *       *       *       *    There was croquet after lunch--a game at which I am a poor performer.  Miss Derrick and I played the professor and Chase. Chase was a little  better than myself; the professor, by dint of extreme earnestness and  care, managed to play a fair game; and Phyllis was an expert.    \"I was reading a book,\" said she, as we stood together watching the  professor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn, \"by an  author of the same surname as you, Mr. Garnet. Is he a relation of  yours?\"    \"I am afraid I am the person, Miss Derrick,\" I said.    \"You wrote the book?\"    \"A man must live,\" I said apologetically.    \"Then you must have--oh, nothing.\"    \"I could not help it, I'm afraid. But your criticism was very kind.\"    \"Did you know what I was going to say?\"    \"I guessed.\"    \"It was lucky I liked it,\" she said with a smile.    \"Lucky for me,\" I said.    \"Why?\"    \"It will encourage me to write another book. So you see what you have  to answer for. I hope it will not trouble your conscience.\"    At the other end of the lawn the professor was still patting the balls  about, Chase the while advising him to allow for windage and elevation  and other mysterious things.    \"I should not have thought,\" she said, \"that an author cared a bit for  the opinion of an amateur.\"    \"It all depends.\"    \"On the author?\"    \"On the amateur.\"    It was my turn to play at this point. I missed--as usual.    \"I didn't like your heroine, Mr. Garnet.\"    \"That was the one crumpled rose leaf. I have been wondering why ever  since. I tried to make her nice. Three of the critics liked her.\"    \"Really?\"    \"And the modern reviewer is an intelligent young man. What is a  'creature,' Miss Derrick?\"    \"Pamela in your book is a creature,\" she replied unsatisfactorily,  with the slightest tilt of the chin.    \"My next heroine shall be a triumph,\" I said.    She should be a portrait, I resolved, from life.    Shortly after, the game came somehow to an end. I do not understand  the intricacies of croquet. But Phyllis did something brilliant and  remarkable with the balls, and we adjourned for tea, which had been  made ready at the edge of the lawn while we played.    The sun was setting as I left to return to the farm, with the hen  stored neatly in a basket in my hand. The air was deliciously cool and  full of that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a  broiling midsummer afternoon. Far away--the sound seemed almost "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#9)"],[1,"year.    Song--harsh, discordant, laughing chuckle or rattle--never musical.    Upper parts blue--wings and tail with white markings--lower parts white  with two blue bands across breast--bluish tinge on sides--a white spot  in front of each eye.--Head large and crested--bill longer than  head--feet small.    Food--principally fish which it obtains by diving and kills by striking  against a tree if large, or swallows alive if small.--This food  supplemented by larger insects, shrimps, etc.    Nest--tunnelled out of bank--six to eight feet deep--at the extreme end  of tunnel is the nest made of fish-bones and scales.

The window was  open and the curtain flapped idly in the breeze.    Presently into the room darted a bird.  He was beautifully dressed.  His soft gray uniform was spotted and barred with white.    He did not seem in the least alarmed when he found himself in the room  with Phyllis.  He perched on the window-ledge and did not even glance  at the little girl.    In a moment he flew to the ledge above her door.  With his strong  little bill he began to rap, rap, rap at the wood.    \"You act like a woodpecker, but you do not look like one,\" said Phyllis.    \"That shows that you do not know all about woodpeckers,\" said the gray,  downy bird.  \"I belong to the family of red-headed woodpeckers.\"    \"You?\" cried Phyllis, amazed.  \"But where is your red cap, and where is  your white vest, and where is your black coat?  You are trying to fool  me, my friend.\"    \"My father and mother have crimson heads and necks and throats.  They  have white breasts.  They have black backs and wings and tails.  When  they fly, the broad white bands on the wings are quite plain to be seen.    \"My home nest is that in the trunk of the old oak by the gate.\"    \"It is very queer,\" said Phyllis.  \"Perhaps some other bird laid an egg  in the woodpeckers' nest by mistake.\"    The small bird fluttered quite helplessly with laughter.    \"Oh, no, Phyllis, I see I have to tell you all about it.  I am a  woodpecker, surely.  But I am quite young yet.  It is not a week since  I had my first lesson in flying.\"    \"You fly very well for a young bird,\" said Phyllis.    \"Well, my mother is very wise,\" said the bird.    \"She does not think it well for her babies to get out of the nest until  they have grown quite large.  She says that if we wait until our wings  are strong we will not be so apt to fall into danger.    \"So I remained inside the nest until I was quite a large, strong bird.  Then my parents called me out and taught me to fly.    \"Only yesterday I asked my mother why I did not wear a dress and cap  like her own.    \"She said, 'Wait a little longer, my child.  When you are quite grown  your cap will be as red as my own.  You will look so much like your  father and me that those children down there will be unable to tell us  apart.'    \"It is little wonder that you did not know me for a woodpecker in this  simple gray dress.  All woodpecker children, however, dress in this  quiet fashion at first.  I shall be happy when I get my gorgeous red  cap.\"    \"Well,\" said Phyllis, \"I am very glad you came to see me.  I knew there  was a nest in the old oak-tree.  I watched your father and mother one  whole morning a few weeks ago.  I think they chose the oak because of  those old dead branches.    \"I saw your mother brace herself against the tree with her stiff tail.  Then how her wedge-shaped bill rapped and rapped against the wood.  For  fully twenty minutes she rapped away at the rotten wood.  Then she grew  tired and your father took her place at the tree-trunk.    \"Soon they pecked a hole deep enough to hide them from sight, but their  constant rap, rap, rap could still be heard.    \"I wondered how deep they made the hole, but it was too high for me to  climb to find out.\"    \"Having just come from the nest I can tell you all about it,\" replied  the young woodpecker.  \"My parents dug down into the soft trunk to a  depth of perhaps eighteen inches.  At the bottom they hollowed out a  large roomy place for the nest.  They did not line it with feathers or  grasses.  Instead of a bed of moss was a little sawdust and the smooth  white sides of the oak.    \"In this nest my mother laid six pure white eggs.  She sat on them and  kept them warm until at last six downy birds came out of the shells.    \"We were hungry little things.  Both our mother and father were kept  busy filling our greedy, ever-open mouths.    \"And whatever they brought was sure to be very nice.  Sometimes it was  a cherry or a berry, sometimes a bit of pear or apple.    \"But, best of all, were the fat, juicy little grubs which they often  brought.    \"I asked my father where he got the grubs.  He made fun of me and  called out to my mother in his shrill, lively way.    \"She said that that was a thing which every young woodpecker should  find out for himself.    \"After that, every time a fat grub was brought to me, I wondered if I  should ever be able to find them when I began to shift for myself.    \"At last my wings were strong enough and my parents called me out of  the nest.  I very soon found that the fat grubs lived beneath the bark  of my own oak-tree.  All I had to do was to strike my bill into the  bark and bear off the prize.\"    \"Were you sorry to leave your safe high nest?\" asked Phyllis.    \"Indeed it was not so safe,\" said the young woodpecker.  \"On the day  that I left the nest a great black snake crept in.  He swallowed my  little brothers and sisters.    \"My parents were wild with grief.  They said that was the thing they  always dreaded, that such things often happened in woodpeckers' nests.\"    \"How sad!\" said Phyllis.  \"I should never have thought of snakes!\"    \"They are our greatest danger,\" was the reply.  \"Squirrels sometimes  come in and steal the nuts and corn we have stored away, but the snake  is the most to be feared.\"    \"So you store away food?\" Phyllis asked.  \"Do you stay here in the  winter, then?\"    \"Oh, yes, we often stay all winter.  Have you not seen us flying about  among the trees in the winter-time?\"    By this time the bird sat on the window-sill.    \"Must you go?\" asked Phyllis.  \"Here is a strawberry for you.\"    \"Thanks,\" said the bird, pecking away at the fruit.  \"I am just off to  the corn-field.  My father showed me this morning how to open the husks  of the green corn to get at the rich, milky kernels inside.\"    \"When you get your red cap, come back,\" cried Phyllis, and the young  woodpecker's lively cry answered from the corn-field.          A LEGEND OF THE NORTHLAND[1]      Away, away in the Northland,      Where the hours of the day are few,    And the nights are so long in winter      They cannot sleep them through;      Where they harness the swift reindeer      To the sledges, when it snows;    And the children look like bears' cubs      In their funny, furry clothes;      They tell them a curious story--      I don't believe 'tis true;    And yet you may learn a lesson      If I tell the tale to you.      Once, when the good Saint Peter      Lived in the world below,    And walked about it, preaching,      Just as he did, you know,      He came to the door of a cottage,      In travelling round the earth,    Where a little woman was making cakes      And baking them on the hearth;      And being faint with fasting,      For the day was almost done,    He asked her from her store of cakes      To give him a single one.      So she made a very little cake,      But as it baking lay,    She looked at it, and thought it seemed      Too large to give away.      Therefore she kneaded another,      And still a smaller one,    But it looked, when she turned it over,      As large as the first had done.      Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,      And rolled and rolled it flat;    And baked it as thin as a wafer--      But she couldn't part with that.      For she said, \"My cakes that seem too small,      When I eat them myself,    Are yet too large to give away.\"      So she put them on the shelf.      Then the good Saint Peter grew angry,      For he was hungry and faint;    And surely such a woman      Was enough to provoke a saint.      And he said, \"You are far too selfish      To dwell in a human form,    To have both food and shelter,      And fire to keep you warm.      \"Now, you shall build as the birds do,      And shall get your scanty food    By boring, and boring, and boring,      All day in the hard dry wood.\"      Then up she went through the chimney,      Never speaking a word,    And out of the top flew a woodpecker,      For she was changed to a bird.      She had a scarlet cap on her head,      And that was left the same,    But all the rest of her clothes were burned      Black as a coal in the flame.      And every country schoolboy      Has seen her in the wood;    Where she lives in the trees till this very day,      Boring and boring for food.      And this is the lesson she teaches:      Live not for yourself alone,    Lest the needs you will not pity      Shall one day be your own.      Give plenty of what is given you,      Listen to pity's call;    Don't think the little you give is great,      And the much you get is small.      Now, my little boy, remember that,      And try to be kind and good,    When you see the woodpecker's sooty dress,      And see her scarlet hood.      You mayn't be changed to a bird, though you live      As selfishly as you can;    But you will be changed to a smaller thing--      A mean and a selfish man.               --Phoebe Cary.
