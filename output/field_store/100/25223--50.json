[Illustration: _Fig. 40._]    HOW ANY STRUCTURE IS BUILT UP.--It should be observed that each  structure, however small, is usually built from the base up. Just the  same as the more pretentious buildings are erected: First, the sill,  then the floor supports, then the posts and top plates, with their  connecting girders, and, finally, the roof.    The chapter on House Building will give more detailed illustrations of  large structures, and how they are framed and braced. At this point we  are more concerned in knowing how to proceed in order to lay out the  simple structural details, and if one subject of this kind is fully  mastered the complicated character of the article will not be difficult  to master.    OBSERVATIONS ABOUT A BOX.--As simple a little article as a box  frequently becomes a burden to a beginner. Try it. Simply keep in mind  one thing; each box has six sides. Now, suppose you want a box with six  equal sides--that is, a cubical form--it is necessary to make only three  pairs of sides; two for the ends, two for the sides and two for the top  and bottom. Each set has dimensions different from the other sets. Both  pieces of the set, representing the ends, are square; the side pieces  are of the same width as the end pieces, and slightly longer; and the  top and bottom are longer and wider than the end pieces.    [Illustration: _Fig. 41._]    A box equal in all its dimensions may be made out of six boards,  properly cut. Make an attempt in order to see if you can get the right  dimensions.    JOINTS.--For joining together boards at right angles to each other, such  as box corners, drawers and like articles, tenons and mortises should  never be resorted to. In order to make fine work the joints should be  made by means of dovetails, rabbets or rebates, or by beveling or  mitering the ends.    BEVELING AND MITERING.--There is a difference in the terms \"beveling\"  and \"mitering,\" as used in the art. In Fig. 42 the joint A is _beveled_,  and in Fig. 43 the joint B is _mitered_, the difference being that a  bevel is applied to an angle joint like a box corner, while a miter has  reference to a joint such as is illustrated in Fig. 43, such as the  corner of a picture frame.    [Illustration: _Fig. 42._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 43._]    PROPER TERMS.--It is the application of the correct terms to things that  lays the foundation for accurate thinking and proper expressions in  describing work. A wise man once said that the basis of true science  consists in correct definitions.    PICTURE FRAMES.--In picture frames the mitered corners may have a saw  kerf (C) cut across the corners, as shown in Fig. 44, and a thin blade  of hard wood driven in, the whole being glued together.    DOVETAIL JOINTS.--It is in the laying out of the more complicated  dovetail joints that the highest skill is required, because exactness is  of more importance in this work than in any other article in joinery. In  order to do this work accurately follow out the examples given, and you  will soon be able to make a beautiful dovetail corner, and do it  quickly.    [Illustration: _Fig. 44._]    PREPARING A BOX JOINT.--In order to match a box joint for the inner end  of a table drawer, the first step is to select two work sides. One work  side will be the edge of the board, and the other the side surface of  the board, and on those surfaces we will put crosses, as heretofore  suggested.    [Illustration: _Fig. 45._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 46._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 47._]    FIRST STEPS.--Now lap together the inner surfaces of these boards (Y,  Z), so the ends are toward you, as shown in Fig. 45. Then, after  measuring the thickness of the boards to be joined (the thinnest, if  they are of different thicknesses), set your compasses, or dividers, for  1/4 inch, providing the boards are 1/2 inch thick, and, commencing at  the work edge of the board, step off and point, as at A, the whole width  of the board, and with a square make the two cross marks (B), using the  two first compass points (A), then skipping one, using the next two, and  so on.    [Illustration: _Fig. 48._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 49._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 50._]    When this is done, turn up the board Z (Fig. 46), so that it is at right  angles to the board Y, and so the outer surface of the board Z is flush  with the end of the board X, and with a sharp knife point extend the  lines B along with the grain of the wood on board Z, up to the cross mark  C. This cross mark should have been previously made and is located as  far from the end of the board Z as the thickness of the board Y.    We now have the marks for the outer surface of the board Z, and the end  marks of board Y. For the purpose of getting the angles of the end of  the board Z and the outer side of board Y, a cross line (D, Fig. 47) is  drawn across the board X near the end, this line being as far from the  end as the thickness of the board Z, and a vertical line (E) is drawn  midway between the two first cross marks (A).    Now, with your compass, which, in the meantime, has not been changed,  make a mark (F), and draw down the line (G), which will give you the  working angle at which you may set the bevel gage. Then draw down an  angle from each alternate cross line (A), and turn the bevel and draw  down the lines (H). These lines should all be produced on the opposite  side of the board, so as to assure accuracy, and to this end the edges  of the board also should be scribed.    CUTTING OUT THE SPACES.--In cutting out the intervening spaces, which  should be done with a sharp chisel, care should be observed not to cut  over the shoulder lines. To prevent mistakes you should put some  distinctive mark on each part to be cut away. In this instance E, H show  the parts to be removed, and in Fig. 48 two of the cutaway portions are  indicated.    When the end of the board Z is turned up (Fig. 49), it has merely the  longitudinal parallel lines B. The bevel square may now be used in the  same manner as on the side of the board Y, and the fitting angles will  then be accurately true.    This is shown in Fig. 50, in which, also, two of the cutaway parts are  removed.    TOOLS USED IN LAYING OUT TENONS AND MORTISES.--A sharp-pointed knife  must always be used for making all marks. Never employ an awl for this  work, as the fiber of the wood will be torn up by it. A small try square  should always be used (not the large iron square), and this with a  sharp-pointed compass and bevel square will enable you to turn out a  satisfactory piece of work.    The foregoing examples, carefully studied, will enable you to gather the  principles involved in laying off any work. If you can once make a  presentable box joint, so that all the dovetails will accurately fit  together, you will have accomplished one of the most difficult phases of  the work, and it is an exercise which will amply repay you, because you  will learn to appreciate what accuracy means.          CHAPTER VI    THE USES OF THE COMPASS AND THE SQUARE      THE SQUARE.--The square is, probably, the oldest of all tools, and that,  together with the compass, or dividers, with which the square is always  associated, has constituted the craftsman's emblem from the earliest  historical times. So far as we now know, the plain flat form, which has  at least one right angle and two or more straight edges, was the only  form of square used by the workman. But modern uses, and the development  of joinery and cabinet making, as well as the more advanced forms of  machinery practice, necessitated new structural forms in the square, so  that the bevel square, in which there is an adjustable blade set in a  handle, was found necessary.    THE TRY SQUARE.--In the use of the ordinary large metal square it is  necessary to lay the short limb of the square on the face of the work,  and the long limb must, therefore, rest against the work side or edge of  the timber, so that the scribing edge of the short limb does not rest  flat against the work. As such a tool is defective in work requiring  accuracy, it brought into existence what is called the try square,  which has a rectangular handle, usually of wood, into which is fitted at  one end a metal blade, which is at right angles to the edge of the  handle. The handle, therefore, always serves as a guide for the blade in  scribing work, because it lies flat down on the work.    THE T-SQUARE is another modification of the try square, its principal  use being for draughting purposes.    THE COMPASS.--The compass is one of the original carpenter's tools. The  difference between _compass_ and _dividers_ is that compasses have  adjustable pen or pencil points, whereas dividers are without adjustable  points. Modern work has brought refinements in the character of the  compass and dividers, so that we now have the bow-compass, which is,  usually, a small tool, one leg of which carries a pen or pencil point,  the two legs being secured together, usually, by a spring bow, or by a  hinged joint with a spring attachment.    PROPORTIONAL DIVIDERS.--A useful tool is called the proportional  dividers, the legs of which are hinged together intermediate the ends,  so that the pivotal joint is adjustable. By means of this tool the scale  of work may be changed, although its widest field of usefulness is work  laid off on a scale which you intend to reduce or enlarge  proportionally.    DETERMINING ANGLES.--Now, in order to lay out work the boy should know  quickly and accurately how to determine various angles used or required  in his work. The quickest way in which to learn this is to become  familiar with the degree in its various relations.    [Illustration: _Fig. 51._]    DEFINITION OF DEGREE.--A degree is not a measure, as we would designate  a foot or a pound to determine distance or quantity. It is used to  denote a division, space, interval or position."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20769"],[0,"A Field Book of the Stars (#9)"],[1,"again, ends near  [a] and [b], the two brightest stars in Columba.    A line drawn from the easternmost star in the belt of Orion, 32[deg]  directly south, will point out Phaet, in Columba. It makes with  Sirius, in Canis Major, and Naos, in the Ship, a large equilateral  triangle.    The star [b] Columbae may be known by means of a smaller star just east  of it, marked [g].    The Chinese call [a] Chang Jin, the old Folks. Lockyer thinks it was  of importance in Egyptian temple worship, and observed from Edfu and  Philae as far back as 6400 B.C.    On a clear starlight night there are not more than a thousand stars  visible to the naked eye at one time. The largest telescope reveals  nearly a hundred million.    [Illustration: COLUMBA]          CANIS MAJOR (k[=a]'-nis m[=a]-jor)--THE GREATER DOG. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--The three stars in Orion's girdle point southeast to  Sirius, the dog star, in Canis Major, the most brilliant star in the  heavens. It was connected in the minds of the Egyptians with the  rising of the Nile, and is receding from the earth at the rate of  twenty miles a second.    The star [n] is a triple. The cluster (41 M.) can be seen with an  opera-glass, just below it.    Between [d] and [o]^1 note a remarkable array of minute stars, also the  very red star 22.    [d] and [z] are doubles for an opera-glass.    Below [[^e]] there is a fine group.    Betelgeuze, in Orion, Procyon, in Canis Minor, and Sirius form a  nearly equilateral triangle. These stars with Naos, in the Ship, and  Phaet, in the Dove, form a huge figure known as the Egyptian \"X.\"    From earliest times Sirius has been known as the Dog of Orion. It is  324 times brighter than the average sixth-magnitude star, and is the  nearest to the earth of all the stars in this latitude, its distance  being 8.7 light years. At this distance the Sun would appear as a star  a little brighter than the Pole Star.    [Illustration: CANIS MAJOR]          ARGO NAVIS ([:a]r'-go n[=a]'-vis)--THE SHIP ARGO. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--Argo is situated southeast of Canis Major. If a line  joining Betelgeuze and Sirius be prolonged 18[deg] southeast, it will  point out Naos, a star of the second magnitude in the rowlock of the  Ship. This star is in the southeast corner of the Egyptian \"X.\"    The star [p] is of a deep yellow or orange hue. It has three little  stars above it, two of which form a pretty pair.    The star [z] has a companion, which is a test for an opera-glass.    The star [k] is a double for an opera-glass.    Note the fine star cluster (46 M.).    The star Markeb forms a small triangle with two other stars near it.    The Egyptians believed that this was the ark that bore Osiris and Isis  over the Deluge.    The constellation contains two noted objects invisible in this  latitude, Canopus, the second brightest star, and the remarkable  variable star [[^e]].    [Illustration: PUPPIS]          MONOCEROS (m[=o]-nos'-e-ros)--THE UNICORN. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--Monoceros is to be found east of Orion between Canis Major  and Canis Minor. Three of its stars of the fourth magnitude form a  straight line northeast and southwest, about 9[deg] east of Betelgeuze,  and about the same distance south of Alhena, in Gemini.    The region around the stars 8, 13, 17 is particularly rich when viewed  with an opera-glass.    Note also a beautiful field about the variable S, and a cluster about  midway between [a] and [b].    Two stars about 7[deg] apart in the tail of the Unicorn are pointer stars  to Procyon. These stars are known as 30 and 31. The former is about  16[deg] east of Procyon, and is easily identified as it has a  sixth-magnitude star on either side of it. About 4[deg] southwest of this  star a good field-glass will reveal a beautiful star cluster.    [Illustration: MONOCEROS]          ERIDANUS ([=e]-rid'-a-nus)--OR THE RIVER PO. (Face Southwest.)      LOCATION.--Three degrees north and 2[deg] west of Rigel, in Orion, lies  [b] Eridani, the source of the River. Thence it flows west till it  reaches [p] Ceti, then drops south 5[deg], thence east southeast, its  total length being about 130[deg].    The great curve the River takes, just east of the Whale, resembles a  horseshoe.    Acherna, the first-magnitude star in Eridanus, is too far south to be  seen in this latitude.    Note the pretty star group around [b] and a pair of stars of an orange  hue below [n].    The asterism known as \"The Brandenburg Sceptre,\" consisting of four  stars of the fourth and fifth magnitudes, can be seen arranged in a  straight line north and south below the first bend in the River just  west of Lepus.
