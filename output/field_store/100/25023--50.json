Thus it was that the revolutions brought into existence  a group of small states, each populated chiefly by one of the races  inhabiting the Balkans.    [Illustration: THE BALKAN STATES 1913]    RACES IN THE BALKANS.--There are more races represented in the Balkans  than in any similar sized territory in Europe. Most of the Balkan states  lie along what was the northeastern fringe of the Roman Empire. So we  find inhabiting them not only ancient races like the Greeks and  Albanians, but also descendants of Roman colonists like the  Roumanians, and other racial groups like the Serbs and Bulgars, which  represent the survivals of the barbarian invasions of the Middle Ages.  While the larger groups of invaders passed on to the west, these dropped  out and moved southward into the Balkan peninsula, where their  descendants still remain. We must not think that these are pure races.  There has been much intermixture, and to-day all of the groups contain a  strong Slavic element, although some are rather unwilling to admit it.  There is besides a Turkish element in the population, as the result of  the long period of Turkish rule, especially in those districts where  many of the original inhabitants accepted Mohammedanism, as in Albania  and Macedonia.    THE SLAVS.--The Serbs, a Slavic race, form the chief part of the  population in Serbia and Montenegro, as well as in Bosnia and other  parts of southern Austria-Hungary. Together with the Croats and Slovenes  of southern Austria-Hungary, the Serbs are called the Jugo-Slavs  (yoo'go-slavz) or South-Slavs (_jugo_ means \"south\") to distinguish them  from the Czechs, Poles, and Russians of the north. There is, however, a  strong feeling of relationship between these two great Slavic groups.    THE BULGARS.--The Bulgars are descended from a non-Slavic race allied  to the Tatars and Finns. They came into the Balkan region on the heels  of some of the early migrations and seized the land now called Bulgaria;  there, however, they mingled with the native Slavic people whom they  conquered, and whose language they adopted. There are, besides, many  Bulgarians in the Dobrud'ja--the district lying between the lower Danube  and the Black Sea. Likewise in the province of Macedonia, the Bulgarians  form the largest element in the population.    THE ROUMANIANS.--Roumania is the old Roman province of Dacia, and the  Roumanians claim to be descendants of colonists which the Romans sent  into that province as an outpost against invasion. It is certain that  the language spoken by the Roumanians is much like Latin, but, as a  recent writer says, the language is closer to Latin than the Roumanians  are to Romans.    THE ALBANIANS.--The Albanian people are descended from the most  ancient of all the races in the Balkan peninsula; their language is the  oldest language spoken in Europe. For centuries they were nominally  subject to Turkey; but the Turks never really succeeded in conquering  them, though many of the Albanians became Mohammedans.    THE GREEKS.--Though the Greeks are descended in part from the people  who inhabited their country in ancient times, and though they speak a  modern form of the old Greek language, it is certain that the present  inhabitants are a much mixed race. They are largely Slav, but hold a  strong feeling for the great past of their country. This gives them an  unusually strong national rallying point. In many ways the Greeks are  the most progressive of the Balkan races.    RUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AS PROTECTORS OF THE BALKAN COUNTRIES.--The  struggle between the great powers as to which of them should become the  heirs of \"the sick man of Europe,\" as the Sultan of Turkey was long ago  called, dates back about a century. Austria on account of her  geographical position and her desire to expand to the southward, and  Russia on account of her desire for Constantinople and the racial ties  connecting her with the Balkan states, each hoped to be preferred. Both  Austria and Russia, then, for more or less selfish reasons, were anxious  to bring about the break-up of the Turkish Empire in Europe. Whenever a  revolt against Turkish rule would break out, the revolutionists could  almost always count on the help of one or the other of these nations.    Since the Slavs and the Greeks hated each other, and both hated the  Bulgarians, there was sometimes a tendency for the Bulgarians and the  Greeks to look to Austria or Germany for help, as a counterpoise to  Russia's influence on behalf of the Slavic states. At one time, however,  Russia gave great aid to Bulgaria. In all the twists and turns of Balkan  politics we find Russia or Austria posing as protector of the rights of  one or another of the Balkan states.    On the other hand, when all the Balkan states bordering Turkey put aside  their rivalries and combined for an attack on Turkey in 1912, Germany  and Austria gave what moral support they could to Turkey. Austria had no  desire to see a strong league of the Balkan states formed to the south  of her, a league which would be largely under the influence of Russia.    German leaders had already formulated their dream of _Mittel-Europa_  (Mid-Europe), a broad band of German-controlled territory extending to  Turkey. With Turkey itself Germany made treaties which practically  assured her control all the way to Bagdad. Germany had no desire either  for a Balkan league, which would block her way, or for the defeat of  Turkey, which might interfere with the carrying out of the treaties.    THE BALKAN WAR OF 1912.--Turkish rule in Macedonia had become  increasingly bad. Situated in the midst of three of the larger Balkan  countries, it had representatives of each among its population. These  countries put aside for the time being their jealousies of each other.  In 1912 Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro formed an alliance and  presented a demand to Turkey that Macedonia should be made  self-governing. Most of Europe believed that the German-trained army of  the Turks would annihilate the armies of the smaller nations. But in a  little over a month Turkey was beaten. Even Constantinople might have  been taken had Bulgaria pursued the advantage gained by her troops. This  time no nation protected Turkey, and the treaty of peace left her with  only a tiny bit of European territory and the city of Constantinople.  Incidentally, Germany had lost much prestige, for Turkey had fought the  war with the help of German officers and with German encouragement, and  had lost.    THE SECOND BALKAN WAR.--Unfortunately, the victors soon quarreled over  the spoils. Bulgaria had seized Thrace and wanted most of Macedonia,  including the city of Saloni'ca, which had been captured by the Greeks.  Austria intervened to prevent Serbia from getting any increase in  territory on the southwest, toward the Adriatic. Hence Serbia wanted a  share of the lands to the south, claimed by Bulgaria. Bulgaria, backed  by Austria and Germany, refused to make any concessions, or to leave the  dispute to arbitration. She began the second Balkan war with a night  attack on the Serbian and Greek armies, but was unable to defeat them.  On the contrary Bulgaria was defeated within a month, partly because  Roumania and Turkey also entered the struggle against her. Bulgaria had  to give up much of her conquests to her former allies. Roumania claimed  a slice off her northeastern corner, and a Turkish army recaptured  Adrianople and neighboring territory from the hard-pressed Bulgarians.    LOSS OF PRESTIGE BY GERMANY AND AUSTRIA.--One of the important results  of these two wars was the loss of prestige by Germany and Austria. These  \"Central Powers,\" as they were called, had gone out of their way to  encourage first Turkey, and then Bulgaria, and both these countries had  been badly beaten. In any future diplomacy the opinions and desires of  the Central Powers would have less weight and impressiveness than  formerly. To regain their lost influence it was practically certain that  these nations would, at the earliest opportunity, make an attempt to  impose their will upon the victorious Balkan states.        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1. Locate Macedonia, the Dobrudja,      Nish, Sofia, Durazzo. 2. Define and explain Mittel-Europa;      \"The sick man of Europe.\" 3. Which nations of the Balkan      peninsula border upon the Black Sea? Which border upon the      Adriatic? Which lie along the Danube? 4. On an outline map of      the Balkan peninsula indicate the races to which the      populations belong and their distribution. 5. We have read in      this chapter that the old Roman province of Dacia developed      later into modern Roumania; can you name the Roman provinces      which correspond to the modern nations of France, Spain,      England, Switzerland? 6. What do you know of the history of      Constantinople prior to its capture by the Turks? 7. Explain      the causes of the second Balkan war. How did the outcome of      this war affect the history of the great European powers?

CHAPTER VII    THE BEGINNINGS OF THE GREAT WAR      GERMANY'S RESPONSIBILITY.--Germany's tremendous increase of armaments,  her opposition to arbitration, her hostility to the purpose of the Hague  Conferences, her building up of the Triple Alliance, her challenge to  England's naval supremacy and her refusal to accept England's suggestion  that both nations should limit their expenditures on naval armaments,  the glorification of war on the part of her teachers and writers,--all  make it clear that the present Great War was of her planning.

His message is spoken, his race is run; he is weary  of life and longs to die. There is something inexpressibly moving in  his profound melancholy.    The painter has placed just behind the prophet two little figures  which are like attendant spirits. They seem to sympathize with  Jeremiah's sorrows. The figures ornamenting the sculptured niche  remind us of those in the background of the Holy Family and have a  similar decorative purpose.    Those who have studied the history of the times in which Michelangelo  lived may find in this figure of Jeremiah an expression of the  artist's own character. Like the old Hebrew prophet, he lived in the  midst of a corruption which he was helpless to remedy, and which  saddened his inmost soul. His own life was full of disappointments. In  his lonely old age he wrote a sonnet, which is not unlike some of  Jeremiah's utterances, and which is a clue to the meaning of the  picture:--        \"Borne to the utmost brink of life's dark sea,      Too late thy joys I understand, O earth!      How thou dost promise peace which cannot be,      And that repose which ever dies at birth.      The retrospect of life through many a day,      Now to its close attained by Heaven's decree,      Brings forth from memory, in sad array,      Only old errors, fain forgot by me,--      Errors which e'en, if long life's erring day,      To soul destruction would have led my way.      For this I know--the greatest bliss on high      Belongs to him called earliest to die.\"          X    DANIEL      In striking contrast to the bowed and sorrowful old prophet Jeremiah  is the alert and eager youth Daniel. The two men were contemporaries,  though there was a difference in their ages. When, in the reign of  Jehoiakim, the Jews were taken into captivity to Babylon, the youth  Daniel went with them, while the old prophet Jeremiah was left behind.  Daniel was chosen, with three companions, to be educated at the court  of the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar. They were taught the Chaldean  language and the sciences, and the king was delighted with their  progress.    An opportunity soon came for Daniel to be of service to his royal  patron. Nebuchadnezzar had a strange dream, which none of his  magicians could interpret, because, unfortunately, he had forgotten  it. In his anger that no one could supply the lost memory, he  commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. But Daniel prayed to  God that the secret might be revealed to him.    His prayers were answered, and he related to the king not only just  what the dream was, but the full meaning of it:[27] \"Thou, O king,  sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness  was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.  This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver,  his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of  iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out  without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron  and clay, and brake them to pieces.... And the stone that smote the  image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.\"    [Footnote 27: Daniel, chapter ii. verses 31-35.]    In Daniel's interpretation the different portions of the image  represented the different kingdoms which should follow, one after  another, in the future. The stone which brake the image in pieces  referred to the final kingdom which the God of heaven shall set up,  \"which shall never be destroyed,\" but which shall stand forever.    From this time forth Daniel became a seer. He had many wonderful  visions in the night, and interpreted them with reference to future  historical events. He was also a statesman, the king having made him  governor of the province as a reward for his services. In later years  he acted as viceroy at a time when the king was insane.    In the reign of Nebuchadnezzar's successor, Belshazzar, Daniel was  again called into service as a seer. One night, during a great feast,  a mysterious hand appeared to write some inscription on the wall, and  Daniel alone could interpret it. The message was ominous, but the  prophet spoke out boldly. \"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN,\"  ran the words, \"Thou art weighed in the balances and art found  wanting.\" Daniel condemned the king for his iniquities, and declared  that his kingdom should be divided by the Medes and Persians. That  very night Belshazzar was slain, and Darius, the Median, took the  kingdom.    [Illustration: DANIEL. _Sistine Chapel, Rome._]    Under the new dynasty Daniel was given so much power that some of the  officials, jealous of his preferment, plotted against him. They  contrived to persuade King Darius to sign a decree that \"whosoever  should ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of the  king himself, should be cast into the den of lions.\" The officials  were right in supposing that this would entrap Daniel into  law-breaking, for, faithful to his Hebrew training, he offered prayer  to God three times a day. He was therefore cast into the lions' den,  but no harm befell him, because, according to his own explanation, God  sent his angel to shut the lions' mouths.    Daniel continued to hold office even in the reign of the next king,  Cyrus the Persian. He lived to a great old age, but he was so young  when he first showed his prophetic gifts that it is natural to think  of him in his youth as Michelangelo has represented him. It would seem  that the artist had in mind Daniel's early years of education at  court. On his lap is a large open book supported on the back of a tiny  figure standing between his knees. This may represent a volume of  Chaldean learning. His posture shows that he has been consulting the  volume, and now turns to his writing tablets to record his own  thoughts.    His broad forehead shows him to be a student and a thinker. The waving  hair is brushed back to form an aureole about his face. It is the face  of a dreamer in a moment of inspiration. Eagerly he writes his words  of mingled poetry and prophecy. He is full of youthful enthusiasm for  his work, a nature fitted for action as well as for vision. He has  also the spirited bearing of one who fears neither the rage of a lion  nor the wrath of a king. There is a breezy energy in his motions, as  if thoughts came more swiftly than he could transcribe them.    His expression of happy anticipation is in vivid contrast to  Jeremiah's sorrowful attitude of retrospection. The picture brings out  clearly the fact that the keynote of Daniel's prophecy is hope.  Looking into his rapt face, we may imagine that this is the message he  is writing: \"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the  firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars  forever and ever.\"[28]    [Footnote 28: Daniel, chapter xii. verse 3.]          XI    THE DELPHIC SIBYL      In the rows of figures which Michelangelo painted along the arched  portion of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, the prophets are  associated with sibyls. Hence, in the plan of decoration, there comes  first the figure of a man, and then the figure of a woman.    Now, as the Bible contains no allusion to sibyls, it may seem strange  that they should have a place in a series of Bible illustrations, and  especially that they should appear side by side with the prophets. To  explain this, we must learn something about the sibyls.    They were women of ancient times supposed to have supernatural gifts  of foretelling the future. They devoted themselves to solitude and  meditation, and sometimes lived apart in caves or grottoes. Sometimes  they were connected with temples, and delivered what were supposed to  be the messages of the gods to the worshippers. These messages were  called oracles, and were greatly revered by the people who consulted  the gods.    Some of the sibyls' words of wisdom were committed to writing and  passed down to following generations. Though they lived in heathen  countries, the tradition ran that they prophesied the advent of  Christ. There is a passage in one of Virgil's eclogues (the fourth)  upon which the supposition is based. Early in the Christian era, when  men were spreading the new faith, they made much of these sibylline  prophecies to add weight to their teachings.    In former times, fact and fable were very often confused, and people  did not take pains to distinguish the legends of the sibyls from the  history of the prophets. When the Latin hymn \"Dies Irae\" was written,  the sibyl was mentioned, with the prophet, as predicting the final  destruction of the world. Many painters and sculptors gave the two  equal honor in the same way. In the prevailing opinion, the sibyls  shared with the prophets an inspired foreknowledge of the Christian  faith.    The nine main panels of Michelangelo's ceiling decoration show how man  was created, and how he was tempted and fell into sin. To carry on  still further the story of the human race, the painter shows the  succession of men and women, prophets and sibyls, who, one after  another, predicted the redemption of the world in Christ. On the side  walls, below these figures, the story is carried to completion in a  series of pictures illustrating the life of Christ. The last named  frescoes were painted by various artists some years before  Michelangelo's work on the ceiling.    The number of sibyls was given as ten or twelve, and of these  Michelangelo selected five. His idea here, as with the prophets,  seemed to be to represent some in old age and some in youth.    [Illustration: THE DELPHIC SIBYL. _Sistine Chapel, Rome._]    The Delphic sibyl is the youngest and most beautiful of them all. She  presided over the temple of Apollo in the Greek town of Delphi, where  it was long customary for the priestess, or _pythia_, as she was  called, to be a young woman selected from some family"]]]
