She turned right and left in her distress. \"How can you be sure?\"    This drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience.  \"Then ask Flora--SHE'S sure!\" But I had no sooner spoken than I caught  myself up. \"No, for God's sake, DON'T! She'll say she isn't--she'll  lie!\"    Mrs. Grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. \"Ah, how CAN  you?\"    \"Because I'm clear. Flora doesn't want me to know.\"    \"It's only then to spare you.\"    \"No, no--there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see  in it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear. I don't know what I  DON'T see--what I DON'T fear!\"    Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. \"You mean you're afraid of seeing  her again?\"    \"Oh, no; that's nothing--now!\" Then I explained. \"It's of NOT seeing  her.\"    But my companion only looked wan. \"I don't understand you.\"    \"Why, it's that the child may keep it up--and that the child assuredly  WILL--without my knowing it.\"    At the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for a moment collapsed, yet  presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force  of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to  give way to. \"Dear, dear--we must keep our heads! And after all, if she  doesn't mind it--!\" She even tried a grim joke. \"Perhaps she likes it!\"    \"Likes SUCH things--a scrap of an infant!\"    \"Isn't it just a proof of her blessed innocence?\" my friend bravely  inquired.    She brought me, for the instant, almost round. \"Oh, we must clutch at  THAT--we must cling to it! If it isn't a proof of what you say, it's a  proof of--God knows what! For the woman's a horror of horrors.\"    Mrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at last  raising them, \"Tell me how you know,\" she said.    \"Then you admit it's what she was?\" I cried.    \"Tell me how you know,\" my friend simply repeated.    \"Know? By seeing her! By the way she looked.\"    \"At you, do you mean--so wickedly?\"    \"Dear me, no--I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She  only fixed the child.\"    Mrs. Grose tried to see it. \"Fixed her?\"    \"Ah, with such awful eyes!\"    She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. \"Do you  mean of dislike?\"    \"God help us, no. Of something much worse.\"    \"Worse than dislike?--this left her indeed at a loss.    \"With a determination--indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.\"    I made her turn pale. \"Intention?\"    \"To get hold of her.\" Mrs. Grose--her eyes just lingering on mine--gave  a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking  out I completed my statement. \"THAT'S what Flora knows.\"    After a little she turned round. \"The person was in black, you say?\"    \"In mourning--rather poor, almost shabby. But--yes--with extraordinary  beauty.\" I now recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke,  brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed  this. \"Oh, handsome--very, very,\" I insisted; \"wonderfully handsome. But  infamous.\"    She slowly came back to me. \"Miss Jessel--WAS infamous.\" She once more  took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me  against the increase of alarm I might draw from this disclosure. \"They  were both infamous,\" she finally said.    So, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found absolutely  a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. \"I appreciate,\" I said,  \"the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken; but the time has  certainly come to give me the whole thing.\" She appeared to assent to  this, but still only in silence; seeing which I went on: \"I must have it  now. Of what did she die? Come, there was something between them.\"    \"There was everything.\"    \"In spite of the difference--?\"    \"Oh, of their rank, their condition\"--she brought it woefully out. \"SHE  was a lady.\"    I turned it over; I again saw. \"Yes--she was a lady.\"    \"And he so dreadfully below,\" said Mrs. Grose.    I felt that I doubtless needn't press too hard, in such company, on the  place of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent an  acceptance of my companion's own measure of my predecessor's abasement.  There was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more readily for  my full vision--on the evidence--of our employer's late clever,  good-looking \"own\" man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. \"The  fellow was a hound.\"    Mrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense  of shades. \"I've never seen one like him. He did what he wished.\"    \"With HER?\"    \"With them all.\"    It was as if now in my friend's own eyes Miss Jessel had again appeared.  I seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation of her  as distinctly as I had seen her by the pond; and I brought out with  decision: \"It must have been also what SHE wished!\"    Mrs. Grose's face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at the  same time: \"Poor woman--she paid for it!\"    \"Then you do know what she died of?\" I asked.    \"No--I know nothing. I wanted not to know; I was glad enough I didn't;  and I thanked heaven she was well out of this!\"    \"Yet you had, then, your idea--\"    \"Of her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes--as to that. She couldn't have  stayed. Fancy it here--for a governess! And afterward I imagined--and I  still imagine. And what I imagine is dreadful.\"    \"Not so dreadful as what _I_ do,\" I replied; on which I must have shown  her--as I was indeed but too conscious--a front of miserable defeat. It  brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed touch of  her kindness my power to resist broke down. I burst, as I had, the other  time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly breast,  and my lamentation overflowed. \"I don't do it!\" I sobbed in despair; \"I  don't save or shield them! It's far worse than I dreamed--they're lost!\"          VIII      What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter  I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution  to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a  common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We were  to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else--difficult indeed as  that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was  least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had  another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its  being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her  perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if  I had \"made it up,\" I came to be able to give, of each of the persons  appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their  special marks--a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly  recognized and named them. She wished of course--small blame to her!--to  sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own  interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way  to escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a probability that  with recurrence--for recurrence we took for granted--I should get  used to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal exposure had  suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion  that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours  of the day had brought a little ease.    On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my  pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of  their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively  cultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other  words, plunged afresh into Flora's special society and there become  aware--it was almost a luxury!--that she could put her little conscious  hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet  speculation and then had accused me to my face of having \"cried.\" I had  supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally--for  the time, at all events--rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that  they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of  the child's eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature  cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I  naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my  agitation. I couldn't abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat  to Mrs. Grose--as I did there, over and over, in the small hours--that  with their voices in the air, their pressure on one's heart, and their  fragrant faces against one's cheek, everything fell to the ground but  their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that, somehow, to  settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of  subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my  show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate  the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as  a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a  matter, for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had  to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion,  so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I  actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as  she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn't, and at the same time,  without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did!  It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little  activity by which she sought to divert my attention--the perceptible  increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the  gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.    Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this  review, I should have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#9)"],[1,"state, of  California, from which we have been excluded by congressional  agitation? Is it in the announcement that slavery does not and is not  to exist in the remaining territories of New Mexico and California? Is  it in denying the title of Texas to one half of her territory?\" He  held that gold washing and mining was particularly adapted to slave  labor, as was agriculture that depended on irrigation.[32] The day  after the admission certain southern senators sent to that body a  _Protest_ against the injustice of the act of Congress, admitting  California as a free State. The Senate refused the clerk permission  either to read or record it. Whereupon the newspapers began publishing  articles of severe criticism and talked of dividing the Union.  Jefferson Davis went before the United States Senate and, addressing  it, called attention to these comments, adding that so much outside  criticism was doing more to divide the Union than the _Protest_ would  possibly do. Congress finally voted that the _Protest_ be  recorded.[33]    Was this to be a free State in every sense of the word? This was  the day when the slave power \"was covertly grasping at the  Spanish-speaking countries beyond the Rio Grande, as it had at the  lands beyond the Sabine.\"[34] At first, it was not, for a good many  slaves were brought into the State. On April 1, 1850, an advertisement  appeared in the _Jackson Mississippian_ referring to _California, the  Southern Slave Colony_ and inviting citizens of slave-holding States,  wishing to go to California, to send their names, number of slaves,  time of contemplated departure, etc., to the _Southern Slave Colony_,  of Jackson, Mississippi. The design was to settle in the richest parts  of the State and to secure an uninterrupted enjoyment of slave  property. The colony was to comprise about 5,000 white persons and  10,000 slaves.    Another effort to extend slavery in this section came in the  unsuccessful filibustering expedition of the Tennessee lawyer, William  Walker, who undertook to establish to the south in Sonora, a State  with a constitution like that of Louisiana, basing his advocacy of  slavery on the lofty grounds of civilizing the blacks and liberating  the whites from manual labor. To explain the meaning of this  expedition Bancroft considers it sufficient to point out that  Jefferson Davis was Secretary of War at that time and that the Gadsden  purchase was then under consideration.[35] In 1852 Peachy of San  Joaquin introduced a resolution to allow fifty southern families to  immigrate into California with their slaves. Some of them came without  permission but on finding that they could not legally hold their  slaves, they sent a part of them back while others became free.    In 1852 the Legislature passed a rigid Fugitive Slave Law intending to  bar slavery from the State. The mischievous clause of this measure was  that all slaves who had escaped into or were brought to California  previous to the admission of the State to the Union were held to be  fugitives, and were liable to arrest under the law, although many of  them had been in the State several years, during which they had  accumulated considerable property. The pro-slavery element not only  profited by this, but the interpretation of this law by many of the  Judges enabled them to bring their slaves into the State, work them in  the mines, and return to the south and back to slavery with their  Negroes.[36]    If they did not wish the trouble of their return passage they  auctioned them off to the highest bidder. It also enabled them to  make fortunes by selling to the slaves their freedom, charging them  twice and often thrice the price he could have possibly brought on the  other side of the Rocky Mountains.[37] In certain southern counties of  the State it was unpopular to speak in behalf of the slaves. In 1855  Chase and Day, two Abolitionists of Alameda County, were ridden on a  rail, ducked and otherwise maltreated.[38] That same year expired the  Fugitive Slave Law which had been renewed from year to year to enable  slave-owners to reclaim fugitives who had sought refuge in that State  prior to its admission to the Union. Fearing that this might be  followed by other legislation hostile to their class, the Negroes held  a convention in San Francisco that year to discuss their rights, their  treatment by the white people, politics, principles and necessity of  education. The Fugitive Slave Law was not reenacted.    Many slaves, however, asserted their rights. Such was the case of  Archy, a slave brought by one Charles A. Stoval from Mississippi to  California in 1857. After hiring Archy out for some time Stoval  undertook to return him to Mississippi. Archy escaped and was arrested  as a fugitive. Stoval sued out a writ of habeas corpus for his  possession and the case came before the Supreme Court for  adjudication. Peter Burnett, formerly Governor, who had been appointed  justice of that court by Governor Johnson in 1857 and filled the  office until 1858, presided. As Burnett was a southern man, his  decision was foreshadowed. He decided that although Stoval could not  sustain the character of either a transient traveler or a visitor and  under the general law was not entitled to Archy, but he yet held that  there were circumstances connected with the particular case that might  exempt him from the operation of the rules laid down. One of the  circumstances was that Stoval was traveling for his health; another,  that he was short of means upon arrival in California; and still  another, that this was the first case of the kind. He, therefore,  ordered Archy to be turned over to Stoval. Joseph G. Baldwin, who  succeeded Burnett, characterized the decision as \"giving the law to  the North and the Negro to the South.\"[39] After being delivered to  Stoval, Archy was taken to San Francisco, but his friends there sued  out a writ of habeas corpus for his liberation before Judge Thomas W.  Freelon, of the County of San Francisco. While this case was pending,  however, Stoval swore to a new affidavit that Archy escaped from him  in Mississippi and procured a warrant from George Pen Johnston, United  States Commissioner, for his arrest as a fugitive slave from  Mississippi. Archy was then discharged by Judge Freelon. He was  immediately rearrested and taken before George Pen Johnston, who  decided that Archy was in no sense a fugitive from Mississippi and  discharged him.[40]    The tendency to free the Negroes brought there checked the importation  of that class. The rights of the master to his slave, however, were  not easily relinquished and the institution of slavery in California  did not come to an end until 1872. Freedom, however, had to win and  the pro-slavery element had to change its policy. In 1856 and 1857  efforts were made to call a convention to change the constitution so  as to permit the importation of slaves, for with the expiration of the  Fugitive Slave Law in 1855, slave-owners who held minors had to return  them to slave States or let them go free. Since the Negroes brought  into the State could in most cases become free the pro-slavery party  then sought to get rid of the free Negro.    In his message to the legislature in 1850, Governor Burnett  recommended the exclusion of free Negroes. This was always Burnett's  hobby. He incorporated this into the laws of Oregon when he revised  them in 1844. Burnett had been brought up in the South and although he  had ceased to be a slaveholder, he could not think of living with  Negroes as freemen. The exclusion of the blacks too had a sort of  popular appeal in it. The legislature, however, was divided on the  question as to what should be done with the free Negro. A bill in  compliance with the wishes of the Governor was introduced but  defeated. Undaunted by this, however, the enemy of the free Negroes  won a victory in another quarter in enacting a law that no black or  mulatto person or Indian should be permitted to give evidence in any  action to which a white person was a party. The leaders of the Negroes  held another convention in 1856 to protest against this law. Another  bill providing for the prohibition of the immigration of free persons  of color into the State was introduced in 1858 and after much debate  put through both houses, but it never became a law. The black code, of  course, was abrogated after the Civil War.                                       DELILAH L. BEASLEY      FOOTNOTES:    [16] Bourne, \"_Spain in America_,\" 271.
