SIZE.--About two feet.    [Figure: Skull of _Hylobates hooluck_.]    I think of all the monkey family this Gibbon makes one of the most  interesting pets. It is mild and most docile, and capable of great  attachment. Even the adult male has been caught, and within the short  space of a month so completely tamed that he would follow and come  to a call. One I had for a time, some years ago, was a most engaging  little creature. Nothing contented him so much as being allowed to  sit by my side with his arm linked through mine, and he would resist  any attempt I made to go away. He was extremely clean in his habits,  which cannot be said of all the monkey tribe. Soon after he came to  me I gave him a piece of blanket to sleep on in his box, but the next  morning I found he had rolled it up and made a sort of pillow for  his head, so a second piece was given him. He was destined for the  Queen's Gardens at Delhi, but unfortunately on his way up he got a  chill, and contracted a disease akin to consumption. During his  illness he was most carefully tended by my brother, who had a little  bed made for him, and the doctor came daily to see the little patient,  who gratefully accepted his attentions; but, to their disappointment,  he died. The only objection to these monkeys as pets is the power  they have of howling, or rather whooping, a piercing and somewhat  hysterical \"Whoop-poo! whoop-poo! whoop-poo!\" for several minutes,  till fairly exhausted.    They are very fond of swinging by their long arms, and walk something  like a tipsy sailor. A friend, resident on the frontiers of Assam,  tells me that the full-grown adult pines and dies in confinement.  I think it probable that it may miss a certain amount of insect diet,  and would recommend those who cannot let their pets run loose in a  garden to give them raw eggs and a little minced meat, and a spider  or two occasionally.    In its wild state this Gibbon feeds on leaves, insects, eggs and small  birds. Dr. Anderson notices the following as favourite leaves:  _Moringa pterygosperma_ (horse-radish tree), _Spondias mangifera_  (amra), _Ficus religiosa_ (the pipal), also _Beta vulgaris_; and it  is specially partial to the _Ipomoea reptans_ (the water convolvulus)  and the bright-coloured flowers of the Indian shot (_Canna Indica_).  Of insects it prefers spiders and the Orthoptera; eggs and small birds  are also eagerly devoured.      NO. 2. HYLOBATES LAR.  _The White-handed Gibbon_.    HABITAT.--Arracan, Lower Pegu, Tenasserim, and the Malayan Peninsula.    [Figure: _HYLOBATES LAR_. _HYLOBATES HOOLUCK_.]    DESCRIPTION.--\"This species is generally recognisable by its pale  yellowish, almost white hands and feet, by the grey, almost white,  supercilium, whiskers and beard, and by the deep black of the rest  of the pelage.\"--_Anderson_.    SIZE.--About same as _H. hooluck_.    It is, however, found in every variety of colour, from black to  brownish, and variegated with light-coloured patches, and  occasionally of a fulvous white. For a long time I supposed it to  be synonymous with _H. agilis_ of Cuvier, or _H. variegatus_ of  Temminck, but both Mr. Blyth and Dr. Anderson separate it. Blyth  mentions a significant fact in distinguishing the two Indian Gibbons,  whatever be their variations of colour, viz.: \"_H. hooluck_ has  constantly a broad white frontal band either continuous or divided  in the middle, while _H. lar_ has invariably white hands and feet,  less brightly so in some, and a white ring encircling the visage,  which is seldom incomplete.\"[3]    [Footnote 3: There is an excellent coloured drawing by Wolf of these  two Gibbons in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1870,  page 86, from which I have partly adapted the accompanying sketch.]    _H. lar_ has sometimes the index and middle fingers connected by a  web, as in the case of _H. syndactylus_ (a Sumatran species very  distinct in other respects). The very closely allied _H. agilis_ has  also this peculiarity in occasional specimens. This Gibbon was  called \"_agilis_\" by Cuvier from its extreme rapidity in springing  from branch to branch. Duvaucel says: \"The velocity of its movements  is wonderful; it escapes like a bird on the wing. Ascending rapidly  to the top of a tree, it then seizes a flexible branch, swings itself  two or three times to gain the necessary impetus, and then launches  itself forward, repeatedly clearing in succession, without effort  and without fatigue, spaces of forty feet.\"    Sir Stamford Raffles writes that it is believed in Sumatra that it  is so jealous that if in captivity preference be given to one over  another, the neglected one will die of grief; and he found that one  he had sickened under similar circumstances and did not recover till  his rival (a Siamang, _H. syndactylus_) was removed.      NO. 3. _HYLOBATES SYNDACTYLUS_.  _The Siamang_.    HABITAT.--Tenasserim Province, Sumatra, Malayan Peninsula.    DESCRIPTION.--A more robust and thick-set animal than the two last;  deep, woolly, black fur; no white supercilium nor white round the  face. The skull is distinguished from the skull of the other Gibbons,  according to Dr. Anderson, by the greater forward projection of the  supraorbital ridges, and by its much deeper face, and the occipital  region more abruptly truncated than in the other species. The index  and middle toes of the foot are united to the last phalange.    SIZE.--About three feet.    This Gibbon is included in the Indian group on the authority of Helfer,  who stated it to be found in the southern parts of the Tenasserim  province. Blyth mentions another distinguishing characteristic--it  is not only larger than the other Gibbons, but it possesses an  inflatable laryngeal sac. Its arms are immense--five feet across in  an adult of three feet high.    The other species of this genus inhabiting adjacent and other  countries are _H. Pileatus_ and _H. leucogenys_ in Siam; _H.  leuciscus_, Java; _H. Mulleri_ and _H. concolor_, Borneo.      _GENUS PRESBYTES--CUVIER'S GENUS SEMNOPITHECUS_.    These monkeys are characterised by their slender bodies and long  limbs and tails. Jerdon says the Germans call them Slim-apes. Other  striking peculiarities are the absence of cheek pouches, which, if  present, are but rudimentary. Then they differ from the true monkeys  (_Cercopithecus_) by the form of the last molar tooth in the lower  jaw, which has five tubercles instead of four; and, finally, they  are to be distinguished by the peculiar structure of the stomach,  which is singularly complicated, almost as much so as in the case  of Ruminants, which have four divisions. The stomach of this genus  of monkey consists of three divisions: 1st, a simple cardiac pouch  with smooth parietes; 2nd, a wide sacculated middle portion; 3rd,  a narrow elongated canal, sacculated at first, and of simple  structure towards the termination. Cuvier from this supposes it to  be more herbivorous than other genera, and considers this conclusion  justified by the blunter tubercles of the molars and greater length  of intestines and caecum, all of which point to a vegetable diet.  \"The head is round, the face but little produced, having a high facial  angle.\"--_Jerdon_.    But the _tout ensemble_ of the _Langur_ is so peculiar that no one  who has once been told of a long, loosed-limbed, slender monkey with  a prodigious tail, black face, with overhanging brows of long stiff  black hair, projecting like a pent-house, would fail to recognise  the animal.    The _Hanuman_ monkey is reverenced by the Hindus. Hanuman was the  son of Pavana, god of the winds; his strength was enormous, but in  attempting to seize the sun he was struck by Indra with a thunderbolt  which broke his jaw (_hanu_), whereupon his father shut himself up  in a cave, and would not let a breeze cool the earth till the gods  had promised his son immortality. Hanuman aided Rama in his attack  upon Ceylon, and by his superhuman strength mountains were torn up  and cast into the sea, so as to form a bridge of rocks across the  Straits of Manar.[4]    [Footnote 4: The legend, with native picture, is given in Wilkin's  'Hindoo Mythology.']    The species of this genus of monkey abound throughout the Peninsula.  All Indian sportsmen are familiar with their habits, and have often  been assisted by them in tracking a tiger. Their loud whoops and  immense bounds from tree to tree when excited, or the flashing of  their white teeth as they gibber at their lurking foe, have often  told the shikari of the whereabouts of the object of his search. The  _Langurs_ take enormous leaps, twenty-five feet in width, with  thirty to forty in a drop, and never miss a branch. I have watched  them often in the Central Indian jungles. Emerson Tennent  graphically describes this: \"When disturbed their leaps are  prodigious, but generally speaking their progress is not made so much  by _leaping_ as by swinging from branch to branch, using their  powerful arms alternately, and, when baffled by distance, flinging  themselves obliquely so as to catch the lower boughs of an opposite  tree, the momentum acquired by their descent being sufficient to  cause a rebound of the branch that carries them upwards again till  they can grasp a higher and more distant one, and thus continue their  headlong flight.\"    Jerdon's statement that they can run with great rapidity on all-fours  is qualified by McMaster, who easily ran down a large male on  horseback on getting him out on a plain.    A correspondent of the _Asian_, quoting from the _Indian Medical  Gazette_ for 1870, states that experiments with one of this genus  (_Presbytes entellus_) showed that strychnine has no effect on  _Langurs_--as much as five grains were given within an hour without  effect. \"From a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#9)"],[1," be 6 paces from and opposite the first  sergeant; the squads form in their proper places on the left of the  right guide, superintended by the other sergeants, who then take their  posts.    The first sergeant commands: Report. Remaining in position at the order,  the squad leaders, in succession from the right, salute and report: All  present; or Private(s)---- absent. The first sergeant does not return  the salutes of the squad leaders; he then commands: 1. Inspection, 2.  ARMS, 3. Order, 4. ARMS, faces about, salutes the captain, reports:  Sir, all present or accounted for, or the names of the unauthorized  absentees, and without command, takes his post.    If the company cannot be formed by squads, the first sergeant commands:  1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Right shoulder, 4. ARMS, and calls the roll.  Each man, as his name is called, answers here and executes order arms.  The sergeant then effects the division into squads and reports the  company as prescribed above.    The captain places himself 12 paces in front of the center of, and  facing, the company in time to receive the report of the first sergeant,  whose salute he returns, and then draws saber.    The lieutenants take their posts when the first sergeant has reported,  and draw saber with the captain.    Generally in camp the saber is not worn. The officers and first  sergeants carry pistols. The hand salute is rendered when so armed.    In the School of the Squad we gave three movements that formed the basis  of the squad drill. There are six movements in the School of the Company  that should be thoroughly understood. When the beginner knows these he  will have no difficulty with the remainder of the close order.        1ST MOVEMENT ON THE FIXED PIVOT      Being in line, to turn the company: 1. Company right (left), 2. MARCH,  3. Company, 4. HALT; or, 3. Forward, 4. MARCH.    [Illustration: SHOWING MOVEMENT HALF COMPLETED]    Notice that the part of the company which has not completed the movement  is perpendicular to the part that has. The common error is for the rear  rank to oblique before marching four paces to the front.    At the second command the right-flank man in the front rank faces to the  right in marching and marks time; the other front-rank men, oblique to  the right, place themselves abreast of the pivot, and mark time; in the  rear rank the third man from the right, followed in column by the second  and first, moves straight to the front until in rear of his front-rank  man, when all face to the right in marching and mark time; the remaining  men of the rear rank move straight to the front 4 paces, oblique to the  right, place themselves abreast of the third man, cover their file  leaders, and mark time; the right guide steps back, takes post on the  flank and marks time.    The fourth command is given when the last man is 1 pace in rear of the  new line.    The command Halt may be given at any time after the movement begins;  only those halt who are in the new position. Each of the others halts  upon arriving on the line, aligns himself to the right, and executes  front without command.    The difference between this movement and squad right is slight. The rear  rank acts a little differently, and the company waits for the command to  move forward. The idea is exactly the same.        2D MOVEMENT ON THE MOVING PIVOT      Being in line, to change direction: 1. Right (left) turn, 2. MARCH, 3:  Forward, 4. MARCH.    Executed as described in the School of the Squad, except that the men do  not glance toward the marching flank and that all take the full step at  the fourth command. The right guide is the pivot of the front rank. Each  rear-rank man obliques on the same ground as his file leader.    [Illustration: THIRD MOVEMENT TO CHANGE FROM LINE TO COLUMN AND  MOVE FORWARD]    Being in line, to form column of squads and move forward: 1. Right  (left) by squads, 2. MARCH.    At the command march, the right squad marches forward; the remainder  of the company executes squads right, column left, and follows the  right squad. The right guide, when he has posted himself in front of the  right squad, takes four short steps, then resumes the full steps; the  right squad conforms.    A common error is for the guide to forget to take the four short steps.    [Illustration: The diagram shows the movement completed]    Keep dressed accurately on the side of the guide. (He is always on the  side opposite from the file closers This is a rule of thumb that should  be memorized at once.) The guide in every squad should keep 40 inches  from the man in front. So many new men forget about the 40 inches. They  usually take a little over 30. When the company is moved into line there  is of course a jam. Hold your head up. Don't look down to the ground.  You will be in the formation more than any other. Try to keep the  following cautions in mind: The leading men of the company should have  four inches interval. Better to have too much than too little if  mistakes are to be insisted upon. Keep the pieces in the correct  positions at right shoulder and then have heads and rifles in a bee  line. When the movement is completed the company will be in the  formation shown in the drawing.        FOURTH MOVEMENT COLUMN RIGHT      Being in column of squads, to change direction: 1. Column right (left),  2. MARCH.    At the second command the front rank of the leading squad turns to the  right on moving pivot as in the School of the Squad; the other ranks,  without command, turn successively on the same ground and in similar  manner.    [Illustration]    It is a very common error for the pivot man to take too short a step and  thereby cause a jam. Bear this in mind. Another very common error is for  the flank man (or men) to take a very long step. This is caused by the  pivot man's forgetting to glance and see when the flank man arrives on  the line, before he takes the full step. Another common error is to get  out of column while making this movement. Bear this in mind and walk  straight to the turning point.    [Illustration: THIS SHOWS THE COMPANY IN COLUMN OF SQUADS, CORRECT  POSITION]    [Illustration: THIS SHOWS THE COMMON ERRORS]    Now we come to the last two movements. They cause more trouble than any  others.        FIFTH MOVEMENT ON RIGHT (LEFT) INTO LINE      Being in column of platoons or squads, to form line on right or left: 1.  On right (left) into line, 2. MARCH, 3. Company, 4. HALT, 5. FRONT.    (On right [left] into line, means turn in the direction that is on your  right and get into line. You have to be in column before the movement is  begun.)    Let us first consider the company in column of squads.    [Illustration]    At the captain's command on right into line, the corporal of the leading  squad commands right turn. The corporals of all the remaining squads, if  halted, command forward, if marching they caution their squads to  continue the march. At the captain's command march, the leading squad  turns to the right on a moving pivot. The remaining squads march  straight to the front.    Each corporal commands right turn before arriving opposite the right of  his squads place in line. When the front rank of his squad has arrived  opposite that place he gives the command march.    The command halt is given when the leading squad has advanced the  desired distance in the new direction. Only the leading squad halts. The  corporal then commands right dress.    The remaining corporals before arrival on the line, command, squad, and  add the command halt just before the right front rank reaches the line.  Then, they, command right dress.    The captain then dresses the company and commands front.    If executed in double time the leading squad marches in double time  until halted.    Now let us consider the company in columns of platoons. See  illustration on next page.    At the captain's command on right into line, the leader of the first  platoon commands right turn, the leaders of the rear platoons, if  halted, command forward; if marching, they caution their platoons to  continue the march. The first platoon executes the right turn at the  captain's command march. Having completed the turn the platoon commander  gives the command, forward, MARCH.    [Illustration]    The remaining platoon commanders give right turn, MARCH, when opposite  their places, and the command, forward, MARCH, when the turn has been  completed.    When the leading platoon has advanced the desired distance the captain  gives the command, company, HALT. At the command company, the leading  platoon leader gives the command, platoon. His platoon only halts at the  captain's command, halt. The platoon leader then gives the command,  right dress, and takes his post in the file closers. The remaining  platoons are successively halted and dressed by their leader. The  captain gives the command FRONT.        SIXTH MOVEMENT RIGHT FRONT INTO LINE      Being in column of platoons or squads, to form line to the front: 1.  Right (left) front into line, 2. MARCH, 3. Company, 4. HALT, 5. FRONT.    (Right [left] front into line means move to the right of the front and  get into line. It is necessary to be in column to begin this movement.)    Let us first consider the company in column of squads. At the captain's  command, right front into line, the corporal of the leading squad, if  halted, commands forward; if marching, he cautions his squad, continue  the march. The corporals of the remaining squads command right oblique.  At the command march, the leading squad moves forward. The remaining  squads oblique as indicated. The command halt is given when the leading  squad has advanced the desired distance; its corporal then commands left  dress.    The remaining corporals command forward, MARCH, when opposite their  places in the line. They halt and dress their squads on the line  established by the leading squad.    When the company is in column of platoons the movement is"]]]
