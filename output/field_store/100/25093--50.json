Many of these results have been treated above.  Others can be searched out in the pages of this volume. What they sum up  to is this: that what was once vaunted as a Constitution of Rights, both  State rights and private rights, has been replaced to a great extent by  a Constitution of Powers. The Federal System has shifted base in the  direction of a consolidated national power; within the National  Government itself there has been an increased flow of power in the  direction of the President; even judicial enforcement of the Bill of  Rights has faltered at times, in the presence of national emergency.    In this situation judicial review as exercised by the Supreme Court does  not cease being an important technique of government under the  Constitution, but its field of operation has contracted. The purpose  which it serves more and more exclusively is the purpose for which it  was originally created to serve, the maintenance of the principle of  National Supremacy. But in fact, this is the purpose which it has always  served predominantly, even in the era when it was cutting its widest  swathe in the field of national legislative policy, the period from 1895  to 1935. Even then there was a multiplicity of state legislatures and  only one Congress, so that the legislative grist that found its way to  the Court's mill was overwhelmingly of local provenience. And since then  several things have happened to confirm this predominance: first, the  annexation to Amendment XIV of much of the content of the Federal Bill  of Rights; secondly, the extension of national legislative power,  especially along the route of the commerce clause, into the field of  industrial regulation, with the result of touching state legislative  power on many more fronts than ever before; thirdly, the integration of  the Nation's industrial life, which has brought to the National  Government a major responsibility for the maintenance of a functioning  social order.    Forty years ago the late Justice Holmes said:         \"I do not think the United States would come to an end if we       [the Court] lost our power to declare an Act of Congress void.       I do think the Union would be imperiled if we could not make       that declaration as to the laws of the several States\".[78]    By and large, this still sizes up the situation.    Edward S.

The absolute veto of the Court of Appeals in the  Wynehamer case was replaced by the Supreme Court, under the due process  clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, by a more flexible doctrine, which  left it open to the State to show reasonable justification for that type  of legislation in terms of acknowledged ends of the Police Power,  namely, the promotion of the public health, safety and morals. _See_  Mugler _v._ Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887); and for a transitional case,  Bartemeyer _v._ Iowa, 18 Wall. 129 (1874).

But Justices Bradley and Swayne pointed out the  potentialities of the due process of law clause, and the former's  interpretation of it may be fairly regarded as the first step toward the  translation by the Court of \"liberty\" as Freedom on Contract.

Wayne speedily recovered from his wound, and in the joy  of his victory it weighed but slightly. He had performed a most notable  feat. No night attack of the kind was ever delivered with greater  boldness, skill, and success. When the Revolutionary War broke out the  American armies were composed merely of armed yeomen, stalwart men,  of good courage, and fairly proficient in the use of their weapons, but  entirely without the training which alone could enable them to withstand  the attack of the British regulars in the open, or to deliver an attack  themselves. Washington's victory at Trenton was the first encounter  which showed that the Americans were to be feared when they took the  offensive. With the exception of the battle of Trenton, and perhaps of  Greene's fight at Eutaw Springs, Wayne's feat was the most successful  illustration of daring and victorious attack by an American army that  occurred during the war; and, unlike Greene, who was only able to fight  a drawn battle, Wayne's triumph was complete. At Monmouth he had shown,  as he afterward showed against Cornwallis, that his troops could meet  the renowned British regulars on even terms in the open. At Stony Point  he showed that he could lead them to a triumphant assault with the  bayonet against regulars who held a fortified place of strength. No  American commander has ever displayed greater energy and daring, a  more resolute courage, or readier resource, than the chief of the  hard-fighting Revolutionary generals, Mad Anthony Wayne.          GOUVERNEUR MORRIS    GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. PARIS. AUGUST 10, 1792.         Justum et tenacem propositi virum       Non civium ardor prava jubentium,        Non vultus instantis tyranni          Mente quatit solida, neque Auster       Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae,       Nec fulminantis magna manus Jovis:        Si fractus illabatur orbis,          Impavidum ferient ruinae.                     --Hor., Lib. III. Carm. III.      The 10th of August, 1792, was one of the most memorable days of the  French Revolution. It was the day on which the French monarchy received  its death-blow, and was accompanied by fighting and bloodshed which  filled Paris with terror. In the morning before daybreak the tocsin had  sounded, and not long after the mob of Paris, headed by the Marseillais,  \"Six hundred men not afraid to die,\" who had been summoned there by  Barbaroux, were marching upon the Tuileries. The king, or rather the  queen, had at last determined to make a stand and to defend the throne.  The Swiss Guards were there at the palace, well posted to protect the  inner court; and there, too, were the National Guards, who were expected  to uphold the government and guard the king. The tide of people poured  on through the streets, gathering strength as they went the Marseillais,  the armed bands, the Sections, and a vast floating mob. The crowd drew  nearer and nearer, but the squadrons of the National Guards, who were to  check the advance, did not stir. It is not apparent, indeed, that they  made any resistance, and the king and his family at eight o'clock lost  heart and deserted the Tuileries, to take refuge with the National  Convention. The multitude then passed into the court of the Carrousel,  unchecked by the National Guards, and were face to face with the Swiss.  Deserted by their king, the Swiss knew not how to act, but still stood  their ground. There was some parleying, and at last the Marseillais  fired a cannon. Then the Swiss fired. They were disciplined troops,  and their fire was effective. There was a heavy slaughter and the  mob recoiled, leaving their cannon, which the Swiss seized. The  Revolutionists, however, returned to the charge, and the fight raged on  both sides, the Swiss holding their ground firmly.    Suddenly, from the legislative hall, came an order from the king to  the Swiss to cease firing. It was their death warrant. Paralyzed by  the order, they knew not what to do. The mob poured in, and most of the  gallant Swiss were slaughtered where they stood. Others escaped from the  Tuileries only to meet their death in the street. The palace was sacked  and the raging mob was in possession of the city. No man's life was  safe, least of all those who were known to be friends of the king, who  were nobles, or who had any connection with the court. Some of these  people whose lives were thus in peril at the hands of the bloodstained  and furious mob had been the allies of the United States, and had fought  under Washington in the war for American independence. In their anguish  and distress their thoughts recurred to the country which they had  served in its hour of trial, three thousand miles away. They sought the  legation of the United States and turned to the American minister for  protection.    Such an exercise of humanity at that moment was not a duty that any man  craved. In those terrible days in Paris, the representatives of foreign  governments were hardly safer than any one else. Many of the ambassadors  and ministers had already left the country, and others were even then  abandoning their posts, which it seemed impossible to hold at such a  time. But the American minister stood his ground. Gouverneur Morris  was not a man to shrink from what he knew to be his duty. He had been  a leading patriot in our revolution; he had served in the Continental  Congress, and with Robert Morris in the difficult work of the Treasury,  when all our resources seemed to be at their lowest ebb. In 1788 he had  gone abroad on private business, and had been much in Paris, where  he had witnessed the beginning of the French Revolution and had been  consulted by men on both sides. In 1790, by Washington's direction, he  had gone to London and had consulted the ministry there as to whether  they would receive an American minister. Thence he had returned to  Paris, and at the beginning Of 1792 Washington appointed him minister of  the United States to France.    As an American, Morris's sympathies had run strongly in favor of the  movement to relieve France from the despotism under which she was  sinking, and to give her a better and more liberal government. But,  as the Revolution progressed, he became outraged and disgusted by  the methods employed. He felt a profound contempt for both sides. The  inability of those who were conducting the Revolution to carry out  intelligent plans or maintain order, and the feebleness of the king and  his advisers, were alike odious to the man with American conceptions  of ordered liberty. He was especially revolted by the bloodshed and  cruelty, constantly gathering in strength, which were displayed by  the revolutionists, and he had gone to the very verge of diplomatic  propriety in advising the ministers of the king in regard to the  policies to be pursued, and, as he foresaw what was coming, in urging  the king himself to leave France. All his efforts and all his advice,  like those of other intelligent men who kept their heads during the  whirl of the Revolution, were alike vain.    On August 10 the gathering storm broke with full force, and the populace  rose in arms to sweep away the tottering throne. Then it was that these  people, fleeing for their lives, came to the representative of the  country for which many of them had fought, and on both public and  private grounds besought the protection of the American minister. Let me  tell what happened in the words of an eye-witness, an American gentleman  who was in Paris at that time, and who published the following account  of his experiences:    On the ever memorable 10th of August, after viewing the destruction of  the Royal Swiss Guards and the dispersion of the Paris militia by a band  of foreign and native incendiaries, the writer thought it his duty  to visit the Minister, who had not been out of his hotel since the  insurrection began, and, as was to be expected, would be anxious to  learn what was passing without doors. He was surrounded by the old Count  d'Estaing, and about a dozen other persons of distinction, of different  sexes, who had, from their connection with the United States, been his  most intimate acquaintances at Paris, and who had taken refuge with  him for protection from the bloodhounds which, in the forms of men and  women, were prowling in the streets at the time. All was silence here,  except that silence was occasionally interrupted by the crying of  the women and children. As I retired, the Minister took me aside, and  observed: \"I have no doubt, sir, but there are persons on the watch who  would find fault with my conduct as Minister in receiving and protecting  these people, but I call on you to witness the declaration which I now  make, and that is that they were not invited to my house, but came of  their own accord. Whether my house will be a protection to them or to  me, God only knows, but I will not turn them out of it, let what will  happen to me,\" to which he added, \"you see, sir, they are all persons to  whom our country is more or less indebted, and it would be inhuman to  force them into the hands of the assassins, had they no such claim  upon me.\"    Nothing can be added to this simple account, and no American can read  it or repeat the words of Mr. Morris without feeling even now, a hundred  years after the event, a glow of pride that such words were uttered at  such a time by the man who represented the United States.    After August 10, when matters in Paris became still worse, Mr. Morris  still stayed at his post. Let me give, in his own words, what he did and  his reasons for it:    The different ambassadors and ministers are all taking their flight,  and if I stay I shall be alone. I mean, however, to stay, unless  circumstances should command me away, because, in the admitted case that  my letters of credence are to the monarchy, and not to the Republic of  France, it becomes a"]]]
