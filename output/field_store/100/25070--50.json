Iowa Horticultural Society.    C. E. SNYDER, PRESTON, DELEGATE      Your delegate arrived at Decorah at nine-thirty, Wednesday, November  seventeenth. Full accommodations offered by the Winneshiek Hotel made  the trip complete and homelike to delegates and members.    The convention was held in the old Marsh Hall, a very suitable place,  offering ample room with all necessary accommodations for such a  gathering.    Decorations showed much time and skill, resulting in a beautiful display  of shrubbery-boughs, evergreen, etc.    The area of a table about one hundred feet long and six feet wide,  running through the center of the hall, contained a great variety of  apples surprising for this season. Many, including C.H. True, of Clayton  county, proved themselves successful orchardists.    [Illustration: Mr. C. E. Snyder, Preston.]    On various other tables large displays of agriculture, apiary,  greenhouse and garden products completed the harmonizing of  horticulture, floriculture and agriculture, including mentioned  decorations appearing as a striking feature and an encouragement to the  cause.    The meeting was called to order shortly after ten o'clock by President  Geo. S. Woodruff. The mingling of many instructive papers with humorous  selections and music proved the program well arranged. Same carried out  very successfully held the interest of a not large but fair attendance  throughout. A paper and address by Wesley Greene, of Des Moines, should  have reached the ears of every Iowa and Minnesota citizen. A striking  selection on \"The Tree,\" by J. A. Nelson, was descriptive, instructive,  humorous and poetic.    A topic of great interest was the everbearing strawberry, which  persistently bobbed up every now and then in interesting discussion.  Brother Gardner, with his practical experience, was right at hand, a  leader and authority on this fruit. Clarence Wedge, who always contended  that the Progressive was away ahead of all others, was endorsed by every  man that grew them in this convention, by a vote on merit of varieties.    Reports from the different districts showed a heavy rainfall throughout  the season, resulting in rust and scab. Sprayed orchards showed better  results than others. Small fruits were abundant and good.    Shortly after four o'clock Wednesday afternoon automobiles drew up and  took delegates and members over beautiful Decorah, stopping at Symond's  greenhouses, and on through the most beautiful park in this section,  then to the palatial residence of John Harter, where a very bountiful  banquet was enjoyed.    During convention Secretary Black's and Treasurer True's reports showed  the society in flourishing condition.    All officers were re-elected, place of next meeting to be chosen later  by the executive committee.           *       *       *       *       *    HANDLING RASPBERRIES.--In 1911 the Government investigators  made comparative tests of the keeping qualities of carefully handled  raspberries and commercially handled raspberries. Several lots of each  kind were held in an ice car for varying periods and then examined for  the percentage of decay. Other lots were held a day after being  withdrawn from the refrigerator car and then examined. The results are  most significant.    After 4 days in the ice car it was found that the carefully handled  berries showed only 0.4 per cent. decay, while the commercially handled  fruit had 4.6 per cent. After 8 days in the car the difference was  vastly greater. The carefully handled fruit showed only 2.2 per cent.  decay, but with the commercially handled this percentage had risen to  26.7, or more than one-quarter of the entire shipment. When the fruit  was examined a day after it had been taken out of the ice car, the  evidence was equally strong in favor of careful handling. Carefully  handled fruit that had remained 4 days in the car was found a day after  its withdrawal to show only 1 per cent. of decay against 17.5 per cent.  in commercially handled berries. Carefully handled fruit left in the car  8 days, and then held one day, showed only 8.1 per cent. of decay as  against 47.6 per cent. in commercially handled fruit.    The following year experiments were made with actual shipments instead  of with the stationary refrigerator car, and the results confirmed  previous conclusions. It was found, for example, that there was less  decay in the carefully handled berries at the end of 8 days than in the  commercially handled berries at the end of 4. Carefully handled fruit  that was 4 days in transit, and had then been held one day after  withdrawal from the refrigerator car showed less than 1 per cent of  decay, whereas commercially handled berries subjected to the same test  showed nearly 10 per cent.          Orcharding in Minnesota.    RICHARD WELLINGTON, ASST. HORTICULTURIST, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.      This paper is purposely given a broad title so that it may cover any  questions which come under the head of orcharding. Many of you who have  been pestered with an \"Orchard Survey Blank\" can easily guess what  subjects are to be taken up. Thanks to many of the members of this  society and other fruit growers for their hearty co-operation, a large  amount of data has been collected from fifty-three counties,  representing most of the districts within the state. As would be  expected certain counties have contributed much more information than  others, probably owing to their greater interest in orcharding. For  example: Thirty-one replies have already been received from Hennepin  County, seven from Goodhue, six from Renville, five each from Houston,  Meeker and Rice, four each from Chippewa, Dakota, Mower, Polk and  Wabasha, three each from Blue Earth, Nicollet, Ottertail, Pine, Ramsey,  Steele, Washington and Watonwan and one or two each from the remaining  counties. Perhaps if the right parties had been reached the low-standing  counties would have a higher ranking.    The best way to present the data is an enigma. If all the information  was given at one time we would need a whole day instead of fifteen  minutes. Of course much of the material is a repetition, and a general  summary will cover the main facts in most cases. Nevertheless it is not  feasible to take up all of the subject matter in this short period, and  therefore the first two topics on the survey blank have been selected,  namely, orchard sites and protective agencies. At a later date, if you  are sufficiently interested in dry facts other subjects, as soils,  dynamiting, orchard management, stock of fruit trees, methods of  planting and pruning, varieties for various localities, etc., will be  taken up. Some of the subjects, like sites and soils, will be treated as  state problems, while others must be considered as sectional.    Minnesota, as you all know, contains many different climatic conditions,  and consequently its orchard practices and recommendations must vary  accordingly. To meet this problem the writer, in consultation with Prof.  Cady, divided the state into six sections, namely, the southeastern,  east central, northeastern, northwestern, west central and southwestern.  Many counties are, of course, in an intermediate position and might be  thrown into either of the adjoining sections, but an arbitrary line  must be drawn somewhere. Freeborn, Waseca, Rice, Goodhue and all the  counties east of them are placed in the southeastern section. Nicollet,  LeSueur, Sibley, McLeod, Wright, Isanti and the counties to the east are  included in the central east, and Pine, Mille Lacs, Morrison and the  counties to the north and east are placed in the northeastern section.  Beltrami, Hubbard, Ottertail and the counties to the west are placed in  northwestern section; Traverse, Douglas, Todd, Stearns, Meeker,  Renville, Yellow Medicine and the enclosed counties in the west central,  and the remainder to the south and west are in the southwestern section.  Thus, when the various sections are mentioned, you will know what part  of the state is being referred to.    _Site of Orchard._ By site of orchard we refer to its location, that is,  whether it is on rolling, level or hilly ground, and the direction of  its slope, provided it has one. From past experience it is believed that  an orchard situated on a north slope is ideally located for Minnesota  conditions, as its blossoming period is retarded and consequently the  liability of injury from late frosts decreased. But all people who want  orchards do not possess such a slope, so they set out their orchards on  the most convenient location. A few growers have orchards sloping in all  directions, and their opinion on the influence of slope on hardiness and  retardation of the blooming period should be valuable. It is of interest  to note that, out of 108 reporting on the levelness of the orchard  ground, only twelve had level ground, two level to nearly level, one  level to decidedly rolling, twenty-nine nearly level, seven nearly level  to slightly rolling, three nearly level to medium rolling, twenty-nine  slightly rolling, four slightly rolling to medium rolling, eighteen  rolling and three decidedly rolling. A glance at the figures shows that  the majority of orchards"]]]
