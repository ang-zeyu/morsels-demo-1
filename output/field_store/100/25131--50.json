If kindness had  been shown to the members of this family surely all the members thereof  would have enjoyed comfort and happiness.    His Holiness Baha'u'llah has given instructions regarding every one of the  questions confronting humanity. He has given teachings and instructions  with regard to every one of the problems with which man struggles. Among  them are (the teachings) concerning the question of economics that all the  members of the body politic may enjoy through the working out of this  solution the greatest happiness, welfare and comfort without any harm or  injury attacking the general order of things. Thereby no difference or  dissension will occur. No sedition or contention will take place. This  solution is this:    First and foremost is the principle that to all the members of the body  politic shall be given the greatest achievements of the world of humanity.  Each one shall have the utmost welfare and well-being. To solve this  problem we must begin with the farmer; there will we lay a foundation for  system and order because the peasant class and the agricultural class  exceed other classes in the importance of their service. In every village  there must be established a general storehouse which will have a number of  revenues.    The first revenue will be that of the tenth or tithes.    The second revenue (will be derived) from the animals. The third revenue,  from the minerals, that is to say, every mine prospected or discovered, a  third thereof will go to this vast storehouse.    The fourth is this: whosoever dies without leaving any heirs all his  heritage will go to the general storehouse.    Fifth, if any treasures shall be found on the land they should be devoted  to this storehouse.    All these revenues will be assembled in this storehouse.    As to the first, the tenths or tithes: we will consider a farmer, one of  the peasants. We will look into his income. We will find out, for  instance, what is his annual revenue and also what are his expenditures.  Now, if his income be equal to his expenditures, from such a farmer  nothing whatever will be taken. That is, he will not be subjected to  taxation of any sort, needing as he does all his income. Another farmer  may have expenses running up to one thousand dollars we will say, and his  income is two thousand dollars. From such an one a tenth will be required,  because he has a surplus. But if his income be ten thousand dollars and  his expenses one thousand dollars or his income twenty thousand dollars,  he will have to pay as taxes, one-fourth. If his income be one hundred  thousand dollars and his expenses five thousand, one-third will he have to  pay because he has still a surplus since his expenses are five thousand  and his income one hundred thousand. If he pays, say, thirty-five thousand  dollars, in addition to the expenditure of five thousand he still has  sixty thousand left. But if his expenses be ten thousand and his income  two hundred thousand then he must give an even half because ninety  thousand will be in that case the sum remaining. Such a scale as this will  determine allotment of taxes. All the income from such revenues will go to  this general storehouse.    Then there must be considered such emergencies as follows: a certain  farmer whose expenses run up to ten thousand dollars and whose income is  only five thousand, he will receive necessary expenses from the  storehouse. Five thousand dollars will be allotted to him so he will not  be in need.    Then the orphans will be looked after, all of whose expenses will be taken  care of. The cripples in the village--all their expenses will be looked  after. The poor in the village--their necessary expenses will be defrayed.  And other members who for valid reasons are incapacitated--the blind, the  old, the deaf--their comfort must be looked after. In the village no one  will remain in need or in want. All will live in the utmost comfort and  welfare. Yet no schism will assail the general order of the body politic.    Hence the expenses or expenditures of the general storehouse are now made  clear and its activities made manifest. The income of this general  storehouse has been shown. Certain trustees will be elected by the people  in a given village to look after these transactions. The farmers will be  taken care of and if after all these expenses are defrayed any surplus is  found in the storehouse it must be transferred to the national treasury.    This system is all thus ordered so that in the village the very poor will  be comfortable, the orphans will live happily and well; in a word, no one  will be left destitute. All the individual members of the body politic  will thus live comfortably and well.    For larger cities, naturally, there will be a system on a larger scale.  Were I to go into that solution the details thereof would be very lengthy.    The result of this (system) will be that each individual member of the  body politic will live most comfortably and happily under obligation to no  one. Nevertheless, there will be preservation of degree because in the  world of humanity there must needs be degrees. The body politic may well  be likened to an army. In this army there must be a general, there must be  a sergeant, there must be a marshal, there must be the infantry; but all  must enjoy the greatest comfort and welfare.    God is not partial and is no respecter of persons. He has made provision  for all. The harvest comes forth for everyone. The rain showers upon  everybody and the heat of the sun is destined to warm everyone. The  verdure of the earth is for everyone. Therefore there should be for all  humanity the utmost happiness, the utmost comfort, the utmost well-being.    But if conditions are such that some are happy and comfortable and some in  misery; some are accumulating exorbitant wealth and others are in dire  want--under such a system it is impossible for man to be happy and  impossible for him to win the good pleasure of God. God is kind to all.  The good pleasure of God consists in the welfare of all the individual  members of mankind.    A Persian king was one night in his palace, living in the greatest luxury  and comfort. Through excessive joy and gladness he addressed a certain  man, saying: \"Of all my life this is the happiest moment. Praise be to  God, from every point prosperity appears and fortune smiles! My treasury  is full and the army is well taken care of. My palaces are many; my land  unlimited; my family is well off; my honor and sovereignty are great. What  more could I want!\"    The poor man at the gate of his palace spoke out, saying: \"O kind king!  Assuming that you are from every point of view so happy, free from every  worry and sadness--do you not worry for us? You say that on your own  account you have no worries--but do you never worry about the poor in your  land? Is it becoming or meet that you should be so well off and we in such  dire want and need? In view of our needs and troubles how can you rest in  your palace, how can you even say that you are free from worries and  sorrows? As a ruler you must not be so egoistic as to think of yourself  alone but you must think of those who are your subjects. When we are  comfortable then you will be comfortable; when we are in misery how can  you, as a king, be in happiness?\"    The purport is this that we are all inhabiting one globe of earth. In  reality we are one family and each one of us is a member of this family.  We must all be in the greatest happiness and comfort, under a just rule  and regulation which is according to the good pleasure of God, thus  causing us to be happy, for this life is fleeting.    If man were to care for himself only he would be nothing but an animal for  only the animals are thus egoistic. If you bring a thousand sheep to a  well to kill nine hundred and ninety-nine the one remaining sheep would go  on grazing, not thinking of the others and worrying not at all about the  lost, never bothering that its own kind had passed away, or had perished  or been killed. To look after one's self only is therefore an animal  propensity. It is the animal propensity to live solitary and alone. It is  the animal proclivity to look after one's own comfort. But man was created  to be a man--to be fair, to be just, to be merciful, to be kind to all his  species, never to be willing that he himself be well off while others are  in misery and distress--this is an attribute of the animal and not of man.  Nay, rather, man should be willing to accept hardships for himself in  order that others may enjoy wealth; he should enjoy trouble for himself  that others may enjoy happiness and well-being. This is the attribute of  man. This is becoming of man. Otherwise man is not man--he is less than the  animal.    The man who thinks only of himself and is thoughtless of others is  undoubtedly inferior to the animal because the animal is not possessed of  the reasoning faculty. The animal is excused; but in man there is reason,  the faculty of justice, the faculty of mercifulness. Possessing all these  faculties he must not leave them unused. He who is so hard-hearted as to  think only of his own comfort, such an one will not be called man.    Man is he who forgets his own interests for the sake of others. His own  comfort he forfeits for the well-being of all. Nay, rather, his own life  must he be willing to forfeit for the life of mankind. Such a man is the  honor of the world of humanity. Such a man is the glory of the world of  mankind. Such a man is the one who wins eternal bliss. Such a man is near  to the threshold of God. Such a man is the very manifestation of eternal  happiness. Otherwise, men are like animals, exhibiting the same  proclivities and propensities as the world of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#9)"],[1,"opened for the soul of man.    He establishes the equality of man and woman. This is peculiar to the  teachings of Baha'u'llah, for all other religions have placed man above  woman.    A new religious principle is that prejudice and fanaticism whether  sectarian, denominational, patriotic or political are destructive to the  foundation of human solidarity; therefore man should release himself from  such bonds in order that the oneness of the world of humanity may become  manifest.    Universal Peace is assured by Baha'u'llah as a fundamental accomplishment  of the religion of God; that peace shall prevail among nations,  governments and peoples, among religions, races and all conditions of  mankind. This is one of the special characteristics of the Word of God  revealed in this Manifestation.    Baha'u'llah declares that all mankind should attain knowledge and acquire  an education. This is a necessary principle of religious belief and  observance characteristically new in this dispensation.    He has set forth the solution and provided the remedy for the economic  question. No religious books of the past Prophets speak of this important  human problem.    He has ordained and established the House of Justice which is endowed with  a political as well as a religious function, the consummate union and  blending of church and state. This institution is under the protecting  power of Baha'u'llah Himself. A universal or international House of  Justice shall also be organized. Its rulings shall be in accordance with  the commands and teachings of Baha'u'llah, and that which the universal  House of Justice ordains shall be obeyed by all mankind. This  international House of Justice shall be appointed and organized from the  Houses of Justice of the whole world, and all the world shall come under  its administration.    As to the most great characteristic of the revelation of Baha'u'llah--a  specific teaching not given by any of the Prophets of the past--it is the  ordination and appointment of the Center of the Covenant. By this  appointment and provision He has safeguarded and protected the religion of  God against differences and schisms, making it impossible for any one to  create a new sect or faction of belief. To insure unity and agreement He  has entered into a Covenant with all the people of the world including the  Interpreter and Explainer of His teachings so that no one may interpret or  explain the religion of God according to his own view or opinion and thus  create a sect founded upon his individual understanding of the divine  words. The Book of the Covenant or Testament of Baha'u'llah is the means  of preventing such a possibility, for whosoever shall speak from the  authority of himself alone shall be degraded. Be ye informed and cognizant  of this.          THE EDUCATORS OF MANKIND      According to the statement of philosophers the difference in degree of  humankind from lowest to highest is due to education. The proofs they  advance are these: The civilization of Europe and America is an evidence  and outcome of education whereas the semi-civilized and barbarous peoples  of Africa bear witness in their condition that they have been deprived of  its advantages. Education makes the ignorant wise, the tyrant just,  promotes happiness, strengthens the mind, develops the will and makes  fruitless trees of humanity fruitful. Therefore in the human world some  have attained lofty degrees while others grope in the abyss of despair.  Nevertheless the highest attainment is possible for every member of the  human race even to the station of the prophets. This is the statement and  reasoning of the philosophers.    The prophets of God are the first educators. They bestow universal  education upon man and cause him to rise from lowest levels of savagery to  the highest pinnacles of spiritual development. The philosophers too are  educators along lines of intellectual training. At most they have only  been able to educate themselves and a limited number about them, to  improve their own morals and, so to speak, civilize themselves; but they  have been incapable of universal education. They have failed to cause an  advancement for any given nation from savagery to civilization.    It is evident that although education improves the morals of mankind,  confers the advantages of civilization and elevates man from lowest  degrees to the station of sublimity, there is nevertheless a difference in  the intrinsic or natal capacity of individuals. Ten children of the same  age, with equal station of birth, taught in the same school, partaking of  the same food, in all respects subject to the same environment, their  interests equal and in common, will evidence separate and distinct degrees  of capability and advancement; some exceedingly intelligent and  progressive, some of mediocre ability, others limited and incapable. One  may become a learned professor while another under the same course of  education proves dull and stupid. From all standpoints the opportunities  have been equal but the results and outcomes vary from the highest to  lowest degree of advancement. It is evident therefore that mankind differs  in natal capacity and intrinsic intellectual endowment. Nevertheless,  although capacities are not the same, every member of the human race is  capable of education.    His Holiness Jesus Christ was an educator of humanity. His teachings were  altruistic; His bestowal universal. He taught mankind by the power of the  Holy Spirit and not through human agency, for the human power is limited  whereas the divine power is illimitable and infinite. The influence and  accomplishment of Christ will attest this. Galen the Greek physician and  philosopher who lived in the second century A.D., wrote a treatise upon  the civilization of nations. He was not a Christian but he has borne  testimony that religious beliefs exercise an extraordinary effect upon the  problems of civilization. In substance he says: \"There are certain people  among us, followers of Jesus the Nazarene who was killed in Jerusalem.  These people are truly imbued with moral principles which are the envy of  philosophers. They believe in God and fear Him. They have hopes in His  favors, therefore they shun all unworthy deeds and actions and incline to  praiseworthy ethics and morals. Day and night they strive that their deeds  may be commendable and that they may contribute to the welfare of  humanity; therefore each one of them is virtually a philosopher, for these  people have attained unto that which is the essence and purport of  philosophy. These people have praiseworthy morals even though they may be  illiterate.\"    The purpose of this is to show that the holy Manifestations of God, the  divine prophets, are the first teachers of the human race. They are  universal educators and the fundamental principles they have laid down are  the causes and factors of the advancement of nations. Forms and imitations  which creep in afterward are not conducive to that progress. On the  contrary these are destroyers of human foundations established by the  heavenly educators. These are clouds which obscure the Sun of Reality. If  you reflect upon the essential teachings of Jesus you will realize that  they are the light of the world. Nobody can question their truth. They are  the very source of life and the cause of happiness to the human race. The  forms and superstitions which appeared and obscured the light did not  affect the reality of Christ. For example, His Holiness Jesus Christ said:  \"Put up the sword into the sheath.\" The meaning is that warfare is  forbidden and abrogated; but consider the Christian wars which took place  afterward. Christian hostility and inquisition spared not even the  learned; he who proclaimed the revolution of the earth was imprisoned; he  who announced the new astronomical system was persecuted as a heretic;  scholars and scientists became objects of fanatical hatred and many were  killed and tortured. How do these actions conform with the teachings of  Jesus Christ and what relation do they bear to his own example? For Christ  declared: \"Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you that  you may be sons of your Father which is in Heaven; for He maketh His sun  to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the  unjust.\" How can hatred, hostility and persecution be reconciled with  Christ and His teachings?    Therefore there is need of turning back to the original foundation. The  fundamental principles of the prophets are correct and true. The  imitations and superstitions which have crept in are at wide variance with  the original precepts and commands. His Holiness Baha'u'llah has revoiced  and re-established the quintessence of the teachings of all the prophets,  setting aside the accessories and purifying religion from human  interpretation. He has written a book entitled Hidden Words. The preface  announces that it contains the essences of the words of the prophets of  the past clothed in the garment of brevity for the teaching and spiritual  guidance of the people of the world. Read it that you may understand the  true foundations of religion and reflect upon the inspiration of the  messengers of God. It is light upon light.    We must not look for truth in the deeds and actions of nations; we must  investigate truth at its divine source and summon all mankind to unity in  the reality itself.          THE DIVINE STANDARD OF KNOWLEDGE      During my visit to London and Paris last year I had many talks with the  materialistic philosophers of Europe. The basis of all their conclusions  is that the acquisition of knowledge of phenomena is according to a fixed,  invariable law,--a law mathematically exact in its operation through the  senses. For instance, the eye sees a chair; therefore there is no doubt of  the chair's existence. The eye looks up into the heavens and beholds the  sun; I "]]]
