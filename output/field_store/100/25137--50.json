The instant I saw Him, I became His slave.\"    In his village of Sar-_Ch_ah, this gifted, high-minded man began to teach  the Faith. He guided in his own family and saw to the others as well,  bringing a great multitude under the law of the love of God, leading each  one to the path of salvation.    Up to that time he had always been a close companion of Mir Alam _Kh_an,  the Governor of Qa'in, had rendered him important services, and had  enjoyed the Governor's respect and trust. Now that shameless prince turned  against him in a rage on account of his religion, seized his property and  plundered it; for the Amir was terrified of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah. He  banished Nabil-i-Akbar and ruined Nabil of Qa'in. After throwing him in  prison and torturing him, he drove him out as a homeless vagrant.    To Nabil, the sudden calamity was a blessing, the sacking of his earthly  goods, the expulsion into the desert, was a kingly crown and the greatest  favor God could grant him. For some time he remained in Tihran, to outward  seeming a pauper of no fixed abode, but inwardly rejoicing; for this is  the characteristic of every soul who is firm in the Covenant.    He had access to the society of the great and knew the condition of the  various princes. He would, therefore, frequent some of them and give them  the message. He was a consolation to the hearts of the believers and as a  drawn sword to the enemies of Baha'u'llah. He was one of those of whom we  read in the Qur'an: \"For the Cause of God shall they strive hard; the  blame of the blamer shall they not fear.\"(29) Day and night he toiled to  promote the Faith, and with all his might to spread abroad the clear signs  of God. He would drink and drink again of the wine of God's love, was  clamorous as the storm clouds, restless as the waves of the sea.    Permission came, then, for him to visit the Most Great Prison; for in  Tihran, as a believer, he had become a marked man. They all knew of his  conversion; he had no caution, no patience, no reserve; he cared nothing  for reticence, nothing for dissimulation. He was utterly fearless and in  terrible danger.    When he arrived at the Most Great Prison, the hostile watchers drove him  off, and try as he might he found no way to enter. He was obliged to leave  for Nazareth, where he lived for some time as a stranger, alone with his  two sons, Aqa Qulam-Husayn and Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, grieving and praying. At  last a plan was devised to introduce him into the fortress and he was  summoned to the prison where they had immured the innocent. He came in  such ecstasy as cannot be described, and was admitted to the presence of  Baha'u'llah. When he entered there and lifted his eyes to the Blessed  Beauty he shook and trembled and fell unconscious to the floor.  Baha'u'llah spoke words of loving-kindness to him and he rose again. He  spent some days hidden in the barracks, after which he returned to  Nazareth.    The inhabitants of Nazareth wondered much about him. They told one another  that he was obviously a great and distinguished man in his own country, a  notable and of high rank; and they asked themselves why he should have  chosen such an out-of-the-way corner of the world as Nazareth and how he  could be contented with such poverty and hardship.    When, in fulfillment of the promise of the Most Great Name, the gates of  the Prison were flung wide, and all the friends and travelers could enter  and leave the fortress-town in peace and with respect, Nabil of Qa'in  would journey to see Baha'u'llah once in every month. However, as  commanded by Him, he continued to live in Nazareth, where he converted a  number of Christians to the Faith; and there he would weep, by day and  night, over the wrongs that were done to Baha'u'llah.    His means of livelihood was his business partnership with me. That is, I  provided him with a capital of three krans;(30) with it he bought needles,  and this was his stock-in-trade. The women of Nazareth gave him eggs in  exchange for his needles and in this way he would obtain thirty or forty  eggs a day: three needles per egg. Then he would sell the eggs and live on  the proceeds. Since there was a daily caravan between Akka and Nazareth,  he would refer to Aqa Rida each day, for more needles. Glory be to God! He  survived two years on that initial outlay of capital; and he returned  thanks at all times. You can tell how detached he was from worldly things  by this one fact: the Nazarenes used to say it was plain to see from the  old man's manner and behavior that he was very rich, and that if he lived  so modestly it was only because he was a stranger in a strange  place--hiding his wealth by setting up as a peddler of needles.    Whenever he came into the presence of Baha'u'llah he received still more  evidences of favor and love. For all seasons, he was a close friend and  companion to me. When sorrows attacked me I would send for him, and then I  would rejoice just to see him again. How wonderful his talk was, how  attractive his society. Bright of face he was; free of heart; loosed from  every earthly tie, always on the wing. Toward the end he made his home in  the Most Great Prison, and every day he entered the presence of  Baha'u'llah.    On a certain day, walking through the bazar with his friends, he met a  gravedigger named Haji Ahmad. Although in the best of health, he addressed  the gravedigger and laughingly told him: \"Come along with me.\" Accompanied  by the believers and the gravedigger he made for Nabiyu'llah Salih. Here  he said: \"O Haji Ahmad, I have a request to make of you: when I move on,  out of this world and into the next, dig my grave here, beside the Purest  Branch.(31) This is the favor I ask.\" So saying, he gave the man a gift of  money.    That very evening, not long after sunset, word came that Nabil of Qa'in  had been taken ill. I went to his home at once. He was sitting up, and  conversing. He was radiant, laughing, joking, but for no apparent reason  the sweat was pouring off his face--it was rushing down. Except for this he  had nothing the matter with him. The perspiring went on and on; he  weakened, lay in his bed, and toward morning, died.    Baha'u'llah would refer to him with infinite grace and loving-kindness,  and revealed a number of Tablets in his name. The Blessed Beauty was wont,  after Nabil's passing, to recall that ardor, the power of that faith, and  to comment that here was a man who had recognized Him, prior to the advent  of the Bab.    All hail to him for this wondrous bestowal. \"Blessedness awaiteth him and  a goodly home... And God will single out for His mercy whomsoever He  willeth.\"(32)            SIYYID MUHAMMAD-TAQI MANSHADI      Muhammad-Taqi came from the village of Man_sh_ad. When still young, he  learned of the Faith of God. In holy ecstasy, his mind turned Heavenward,  and his heart was flooded with light. Divine grace descended upon him; the  summons of God so enraptured him that he threw the peace of Man_sh_ad to  the winds. Leaving his kinsfolk and children, he set out over mountains  and desert plains, passed from one halting-place to the next, came to the  seashore, crossed over the sea and at last reached the city of Haifa. From  there he hastened on to Akka and entered the presence of Baha'u'llah.    In the early days he opened a small shop in Haifa and carried on some  trifling business. God's blessing descended upon it, and it prospered.  That little corner became the haven of the pilgrims. When they arrived,  and again at their departure, they were guests of the high-minded and  generous Muhammad-Taqi. He also helped to manage the affairs of the  believers, and would get together their means of travel. He proved  unfailingly reliable, loyal, worthy of trust. Ultimately he became the  intermediary through whom Tablets could be sent away and mail from the  believers could come in. He performed this service with perfect  dependability, accomplishing it in a most pleasing way, scrupulously  despatching and receiving the correspondence at all times. Trusted by  everyone, he became known in many parts of the world, and received  unnumbered bounties from Baha'u'llah. He was a treasury of justice and  righteousness, entirely free from any attachment to worldly things. He had  accustomed himself to a very spare way of life, caring nothing for food or  sleep, comfort or peace. He lived all alone in a single room, passed the  nights on a couch of palm branches, and slept in a corner. But to the  travelers, he was a spring in the desert; for them, he provided the  softest of pillows, and the best table he could afford. He had a smiling  face and by nature was spiritual and serene.    After the Daystar of the Supreme Concourse had set, Siyyid Man_sh_adi  remained loyal to the Covenant, a sharp sword confronting the violators.  They tried every ruse, every deceit, all their subtlest expedients; it is  beyond imagining how they showered favors on him and what honors they paid  him, what feasts they prepared, what pleasures they offered, all this to  make a breach in his faith. Yet every day he grew stronger than before,  continued to be staunch and true, kept free from every unseemly thought,  and shunned whatever went contrary to the Covenant of God. When they  finally despaired of shaking his resolve, they harassed him in every  possible way, and plotted his financial ruin. He remained, however, the  quintessence of constancy and trust.    When, at the instigation of the violators, 'Abdu'l-Hamid began his  opposition to me, I was obliged to send Man_sh_adi away to Port Sa'id,  because he was widely known among the people as the distributor of our  mail. I then had to relay the correspondence to him through intermediaries  who were unknown, and he would send the letters on as before. In this way  the treacherous and the hostile were unable to take over the mail. During  the latter days of 'Abdu'l-Hamid, when a commission of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#9)"],[1,"the peoples of all faiths....    \"Call thou to remembrance Him Who was the Spirit [Jesus], Who, when He  came, the most learned of His age pronounced judgment against Him in His  own country, whilst he who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take  heed, then, ye men of understanding heart! Thou, in truth, art one of the  suns of the heaven of His names. Guard thyself, lest darkness spread its  veils over thee, and fold thee away from His light.... Consider those who  opposed the Son [Jesus], when He came unto them with sovereignty and  power. How many the Pharisees who were waiting to behold Him, and were  lamenting over their separation from Him! And yet, when the fragrance of  His coming was wafted over them, and His beauty was unveiled, they turned  aside from Him and disputed with Him.... None save a very few, who were  destitute of any power amongst men, turned towards His face. And yet today  every man endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself  on His Name! In like manner, consider how numerous, in these days, are the  monks who, in My Name, have secluded themselves in their churches, and  who, when the appointed time was fulfilled, and We unveiled Our beauty,  knew Us not, though they call upon Me at eventide and at dawn....    \"The Word which the Son concealed is made manifest. It hath been sent down  in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be the Lord Who is  the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great  majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, O concourse of the righteous!  ...This is the day whereon the Rock [Peter] crieth out and shouteth, and  celebrateth the praise of its Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most High,  saying: 'Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the  Kingdom is fulfilled!...' My body longeth for the cross, and Mine head  waiteth the thrust of the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful, that the  world may be purged from its transgressions....    \"O Supreme Pontiff! Incline thine ear unto that which the Fashioner of  moldering bones counseleth thee, as voiced by Him Who is His Most Great  Name. Sell all the embellished ornaments thou dost possess, and expend  them in the path of God, Who causeth the night to return upon the day, and  the day to return upon the night. Abandon thy kingdom unto the kings, and  emerge from thy habitation, with thy face set towards the Kingdom, and,  detached from the world, then speak forth the praises of thy Lord betwixt  earth and heaven. Thus hath bidden thee He Who is the Possessor of Names,  on the part of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Exhort thou the  kings and say: 'Deal equitably with men. Beware lest ye transgress the  bounds fixed in the Book.' This indeed becometh thee. Beware lest thou  appropriate unto thyself the things of the world and the riches thereof.  Leave them unto such as desire them, and cleave unto that which hath been  enjoined upon thee by Him Who is the Lord of creation. Should anyone offer  thee all the treasures of the earth, refuse to even glance upon them. Be  as thy Lord hath been. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken that  which God hath made the ornament of the book of creation.... Should the  inebriation of the wine of My verses seize thee, and thou determinest to  present thyself before the throne of thy Lord, the Creator of earth and  heaven, make My love thy vesture, and thy shield remembrance of Me, and  thy provision reliance upon God, the Revealer of all power.... Verily, the  day of ingathering is come, and all things have been separated from each  other. He hath stored away that which He chose in the vessels of justice,  and cast into fire that which befitteth it. Thus hath it been decreed by  your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, in this promised Day. He, verily,  ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is none other God save He, the Almighty,  the All-Compelling.\"    In the Tablet addressed to the Czar of Russia, Alexander II, we read: \"O  Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the  Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among  the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the  kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the  All-Glorious. Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning towards the  face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. We, verily, have  heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst secretly  communing with Him. Wherefore, the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted  forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We answered thee in truth. Thy  Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whilst I lay chained and  fettered in the prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his aid.  Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none  can comprehend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou barter away this  sublime station.... Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who  is the Supreme Sovereign. He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all  the atoms cry aloud: 'Lo! The Lord is come in His great majesty!' He Who  is the Father is come, and the Son [Jesus], in the holy vale, crieth out:  'Here am I, here am I, O Lord, My God!', whilst Sinai circleth round the  House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: 'The All-Bounteous is come  mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe  betide them that are far away.'    \"Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause, and  summon, then, the nations unto God, the Exalted, the Great. Be thou not of  them who called upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is the  Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned aside from Him, and,  in the end, pronounced sentence against Him with manifest injustice.  Consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit of God [Jesus]  appeared, and Herod gave judgment against Him. God, however, aided Him  with the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him  down unto another land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth  what He pleaseth. Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, be he in the  midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, or beneath the sword of  the oppressor....    \"Again I say: Hearken unto My voice that calleth from My prison, that it  may acquaint thee with the things that have befallen My Beauty, at the  hands of them that are the manifestations of My glory, and that thou  mayest perceive how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding My might,  and how immense My forebearance, notwithstanding My power. By My life!  Couldst thou but know the things sent down by My Pen, and discover the  treasures of My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in the  seas of My names and in the goblets of My words, thou wouldst, in thy love  for My name, and in thy longing for My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay  down thy life in My path. Know thou that though My body be beneath the  swords of My foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions,  yet My spirit is filled with a gladness with which all the joys of the  earth can never compare.    \"Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration for the world,  and say: O peoples of the earth! Have ye denied the One in Whose path He  Who came with the truth, bearing the announcement of your Lord, the  Exalted, the Great, suffered martyrdom? Say: This is an Announcement  whereat the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers have rejoiced. This is  the One Whom the heart of the world remembereth, and is promised in the  Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The hands of the Messengers were,  in their desire to meet Me, upraised towards God, the Mighty, the  Glorified.... Some lamented in their separation from Me, others endured  hardships in My path, and still others laid down their lives for the sake  of My Beauty, could ye but know it. Say: I, verily, have not sought to  extol Mine Own Self, but rather God Himself, were ye to judge fairly.  Naught can be seen in Me except God and His Cause, could ye but perceive  it. I am the One Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with  Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned. ...Blessed be the  king whose sovereignty hath withheld him not from his Sovereign, and who  hath turned unto God with his heart. He, verily, is accounted of those  that have attained unto that which God, the Mighty, the All-Wise, hath  willed. Erelong will such a one find himself numbered with the monarchs of  the realms of the Kingdom. Thy Lord is, in truth, potent over all things.  He giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and withholdeth what  He pleaseth from whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful,  the Almighty.\"    To Queen Victoria Baha'u'llah has written: \"O Queen in London! Incline  thine ear unto the voice of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, calling  from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, no God is there but Me, the Almighty,  the All-Wise! Cast away all that is on earth, and attire the head of thy  kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Glorious.  He, in truth, hath come unto the world in His most great glory, and all  that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been fulfilled. The land of  Syria hath been honored by the footsteps of its Lord, the Lord of all men,  and north and south are both inebriated with the wine of His presence.  Blessed is the man that inhaled the fragrance of the Most Merciful, and  turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Beauty, in this resplendent Dawn. The  Mosque of Aqsa vibrateth through the breezes of its Lord, the  All-Glorious, whilst Batha [Mecca] trembleth at the voice of God, the  Exalted, the Most High.
