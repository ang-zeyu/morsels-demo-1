[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#9)"],[1,"   CHARLES DICKENS    From the center of the ceiling of this kitchen, old Wardle had just  suspended with his own hands a huge branch of mistletoe, and this same  branch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and  most delightful struggling and confusion; in the midst of which Mr.  Pickwick with a gallantry which would have done honour to a descendant  of Lady Trollimglower herself, took the old lady by the hand, led her  beneath the mystic branch, and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum.  The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all  the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity, but the  younger ladies not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious  veneration of the custom, or imagining that the value of a salute is  very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it, screamed  and struggled, and ran into corners, and threatened and remonstrated,  and did everything but leave the room, until some of the less  adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting, when they all at  once found it useless to resist any longer, and submitted to be kissed  with a good grace. Mr. Winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes,  and Mr. Snodgrass kissed Emily; and Mr. Weller, not being particular  about the form of being under the mistletoe, kissed Emma and the other  female servants, just as he caught them. As to the poor relations, they  kissed everybody, not even excepting the plainer portion of the  young-lady visitors, who, in their excessive confusion, ran right under  the mistletoe, directly it was hung up, without knowing it! Wardle stood  with his back to the fire, surveying the whole scene, with the utmost  satisfaction; and the fat boy took the opportunity of appropriating to  his own use, and summarily devouring, a particularly fine mince-pie,  that had been carefully put by for somebody else.    Now the screaming had subsided, and faces were in a glow and curls in a  tangle, and Mr. Pickwick, after kissing the old lady as before  mentioned, was standing under the mistletoe, looking with a very pleased  countenance on all that was passing around him, when the young lady with  the black eyes, after a little whispering with the other young ladies,  made a sudden dart forward, and, putting her arm around Mr. Pickwick's  neck, saluted him affectionately on the left cheek; and before Mr.  Pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter, he was surrounded by the  whole body, and kissed by every one of them.    It was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group,  now pulled this way, and then that, and first kissed on the chin and  then on the nose, and then on the spectacles, and to hear the peals of  laughter which were raised on every side; but it was a still more  pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick, blinded shortly afterwards with a  silk-handkerchief, falling up against the wall, and scrambling into  corners, and going through all the mysteries of blind-man's buff, with  the utmost relish of the game, until at last he caught one of the poor  relations; and then had to evade the blind-man himself, which he did  with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause  of all beholders. The poor relations caught just the people whom they  thought would like it; and when the game flagged, got caught themselves.  When they were all tired of blind-man's buff, there was a great game at  snapdragon, and when fingers enough were burned with that, and all the  raisons gone, they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a  substantial supper, and a mighty bowl of wassail, something smaller than  an ordinary washhouse copper, in which the hot apples were hissing and  bubbling with a rich look, and a jolly sound, that were perfectly  irresistible.    \"This,\" said Mr. Pickwick, looking round him, \"this is, indeed,  comfort.\"    \"Our invariable custom,\" replied Mr. Wardle. \"Everybody sits down with  us on Christmas eve, as you see them now--servants and all; and here we  wait till the clock strikes twelve, to usher Christmas in, and wile away  the time with forfeits and old stories. Trundle, my boy, rake up the  fire.\"    Up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred, and the  deep red blaze sent forth a rich glow, that penetrated into the furthest  corner of the room, and cast its cheerful tint on every face.    \"Come,\" said Wardle, \"a song--a Christmas song. I'll give you one, in  default of a better.\"    \"Bravo,\" said Mr. Pickwick.    \"Fill up,\" cried Wardle. \"It will be two hours good, before you see the  bottom of the bowl through the deep rich colour of the wassail; fill up  all round, and now for the song.\"    Thus saying, the merry old gentleman, in a good, round, sturdy voice,  commenced without more ado--        A CHRISTMAS CAROL        I care not for Spring; on his fickle wing      Let the blossoms and buds be borne:      He woos them amain with his treacherous rain,      And he scatters them ere the morn.      An inconstant elf, he knows not himself,      Or his own changing mind an hour,      He'll smile in your face, and, with wry grimace,      He'll wither your youngest flower.        Let the summer sun to his bright home run,      He shall never be sought by me;      When he's dimmed by a cloud I can laugh aloud,      And care not how sulky he be;      For his darling child is the madness wild      That sports in fierce fever's train;      And when love is too strong, it don't last long,      As many have found to their pain.        A mild harvest night, by the tranquil light      Of the modest and gentle moon,      Has a far sweeter sheen for me, I ween,      Than the broad and unblushing noon,      But every leaf awakens my grief,      As it lieth beneath the tree;      So let Autumn air be never so fair,      It by no means agrees with me.        But my song I troll out, for Christmas stout,      The hearty, the true, and the bold;      A bumper I drain, and with might and main      Give three cheers for this Christmas old.      We'll usher him in with a merry din      That shall gladden his joyous heart,      And we'll keep him up while there's bite or sup,      And in fellowship good, we'll part.        In his fine honest pride, he scorns to hide      One jot of his hard-weather scars;      They're no disgrace, for there's much the same trace      On the cheeks of our bravest tars.      Then again I sing 'till the roof doth ring,      And it echoes from wall to wall--      To the stout old wight, fair welcome to-night,      As the King of the Seasons all!           *       *       *       *       *        A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS        CLEMENT C. MOORE        'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house      Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;      The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,      In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;      The children were nestled all snug in their beds,      While visions of sugar-plums danced through their heads;      And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,      Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,--      When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,      I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.      Away to the window I flew like a flash,      Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.      The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,      Gave a lustre of midday to objects below;      When what to my wondering eyes should appear,      But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,      With a little old driver, so lively and quick      I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.      More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,      And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:      \"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!      On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!      To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!      Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!\"      As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,      When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,      So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,      With a sleigh full of toys,--and St. Nicholas too.      And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof      The prancing and pawing of each little hoof,      As I drew in my head and was turning around,      Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.      He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,      And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;      A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,      And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.      His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!      His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;      His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,      And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.      The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,      And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.      He had a broad face, and a little round belly      That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.      He was chubby and plump,--a right jolly old elf--      And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.      A wink of his eye and a twist of his head      Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.      He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,      And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,      And laying his finger aside of his nose,      And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.      He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,      And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;      But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight:      \"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!\"           *       *       *       *       *    A CHRISTMAS PIECE    Of garnered rhyme, from hidden stores of olden time that since the  language did begin, have welcomed merry Christmas in, and made the  winter nights so long, fleet by on wings of wine and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#9)"],[1," word:    I hate to go above you,  Because,\"--the brown eyes lower fell,--    \"Because, you see, I love you!\"    Still memory to a gray-haired man    That sweet child-face is showing.  Dear girl: the grasses on her grave    Have forty years been growing!    He lives to learn, in life's hard school,    How few who pass above him  Lament their triumph and his loss,    Like her,--because they love him.        _John Greenleaf Whittier._          Mother's Fool      \"Tis plain to see,\" said a farmer's wife,  \"These boys will make their mark in life;  They were never made to handle a hoe,  And at once to a college ought to go;  There's Fred, he's little better than a fool,  But John and Henry must go to school.\"    \"Well, really, wife,\" quoth Farmer Brown,  As he set his mug of cider down,  \"Fred does more work in a day for me  Than both his brothers do in three.  Book larnin' will never plant one's corn,  Nor hoe potatoes, sure's you're born;  Nor mend a rod of broken fence--  For my part, give me common sense.\"    But his wife was bound the roost to rule,  And John and Henry were sent to school,  While Fred, of course, was left behind,  Because his mother said he had no mind.    Five years at school the students spent;  Then into business each one went.  John learned to play the flute and fiddle,  And parted his hair, of course, in the middle;  While his brother looked rather higher than he,  And hung out a sign, \"H. Brown, M.D.\"    Meanwhile, at home, their brother Fred  Had taken a notion into his head;  But he quietly trimmed his apple trees,  And weeded onions and planted peas,  While somehow or other, by hook or crook,  He managed to read full many a book;  Until at last his father said  He was getting \"book larnin'\" into his head;  \"But for all that,\" added Farmer Brown,  \"He's the smartest boy there is in town.\"    The war broke out, and Captain Fred  A hundred men to battle led,  And when the rebel flag came down,  Went marching home as General Brown.  But he went to work on the farm again,  And planted corn and sowed his grain;  He shingled the barn and mended the fence,  Till people declared he had common sense.    Now common sense was very rare,  And the State House needed a portion there;  So the \"family dunce\" moved into town--  The people called him Governor Brown;  And the brothers who went to the city school  Came home to live with \"mother's fool.\"          Kentucky Philosophy      You Wi'yam, cum 'ere, suh, dis instunce.

Men whom the lust of office cannot kill;  Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;  Men who possess opinions and a will;  Men who have honor; men who will not lie;  Men who can stand before a demagogue,  And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking;  Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog,  In public duty and in private thinking;  For while the rabble, with its thumb-worn creeds,  Its large professions, and its little deeds,  Mingle in selfish strife--lo! Freedom weeps,  Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps.        _J.G. Holland._          Never Trouble Trouble      My good man is a clever man, which no one will gainsay;  He lies awake to plot and plan 'gainst lions in the way,  While I, without a thought of ill, sleep sound enough for three,  For I never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me.    A holiday we never fix but he is sure 'twill rain;  And when the sky is clear at six he knows it won't remain.  He is always prophesying ill to which I won't agree,  For I never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me.    The wheat will never show a top--but soon how green the field!  We will not harvest half a crop--yet have a famous yield!  It will not sell, it never will! but I will wait and see,  For I never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me.    We have a good share of worldly gear, and fortune seems secure,  Yet my good man is full of fear--misfortune's coming sure!  He points me out the almshouse hill, but cannot make me see,  For I never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me.    He has a sort of second sights and when the fit is strong,  He sees beyond the good and right the evil and the wrong.  Heaven's cop of joy he'll surely spill unless I with him be,  For I never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me.        _Fannie Windsor._          What is Good      \"What is the real good?\" I asked in musing mood.  Order, said the law court;  Knowledge, said the school;  Truth, said the wise man;  Pleasure, said the fool;  Love, said the maiden;  Beauty, said the page;  Freedom, said the dreamer;  Home, said the sage;  Fame, said the soldier;  Equity, the seer.  Spake my heart full sadly:  \"The answer is not here.\"  Then within my bosom  Softly this I heard:  \"Each heart holds the secret:  Kindness is the word.\"        _John Boyle O'Reilly._          The Penny Ye Mean to Gie      There's a funny tale 'of a stingy man,    Who was none too good but might have been worse,  Who went to his church, on a Sunday night    And carried along his well-filled purse.    When the sexton came with the begging plate,    The church was but dim with the candle's light;  The stingy man fumbled all thro' his purse,    And chose a coin by touch and not by sight.    It's an odd thing now that guineas should be    So like unto pennies in shape and size.  \"I'll gie a penny,\" the stingy man said:    \"The poor must not gifts of pennies despise.\"    The penny fell down with a clatter and ring!    And back in his seat leaned the stingy man.  \"The world is full of the poor,\" he thought,    \"I can't help them all--I give what I can.\"    Ha! ha! how the sexton smiled, to be sure,    To see the gold guinea fall in the plate;  Ha! ha! how the stingy man's heart was wrung,    Perceiving his blunder--but just too late!    \"No matter,\" he said; \"in the Lord's account    That guinea of gold is set down to me--  They lend to him who give to the poor;    It will not so bad an investment be.\"    \"Na, na, mon,\" the chuckling sexton cried out,    \"The Lord is na cheated--he kens thee well;  He knew it was only by accident    That out o' thy fingers the guinea fell!    \"He keeps an account, na doubt, for the puir;    But in that account He'll set down to thee  Na mair o' that golden guinea, my mon,    Than the one bare penny ye mean to gie!\"    There's comfort, too, in the little tale--    A serious side as well as a joke--  A comfort for all the generous poor    In the comical words the sexton spoke;    A comfort to think that the good Lord knows    How generous we really desire to be,  And will give us credit in his account,    For all the pennies we long \"to gie.\"          Leedle Yawcob Strauss      I haf von funny leedle poy    Vot gomes shust to my knee,--  Der queerest schap, der createst rogue    As efer you dit see.
