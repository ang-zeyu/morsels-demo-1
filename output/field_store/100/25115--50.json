The day was radiant and warm. Every now and then we heard the  subterranean thunder of Vesuvius; its distant deep peals seemed to shake  the very air and light of day, which interpenetrated our frames with the  sullen and tremendous sound. This sound was what the Greeks beheld  (Pompeii, you know, was a Greek city). They lived in harmony with  nature; and the interstices of their incomparable columns were portals,  as it were, to admit the spirit of beauty which animates this glorious  universe to visit those whom it inspired. If such is Pompeii, what was  Athens? What scene was exhibited from the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and  the temples of Hercules, and Theseus, and the Winds? The island and the  AEgean sea, the mountains of Argolis, and the peaks of Pindus and  Olympus, and the darkness of the Boeotian forests interspersed?    From the Forum we went to another public place; a triangular portico,  half enclosing the ruins of an enormous temple. It is built on the edge  of the hill overlooking the sea. That black point is the temple. In the  apex of the triangle stands an altar and a fountain, and before the  altar once stood the statue of the builder of the portico. Returning  hence, and following the consular road, we came to the eastern gate of  the city. The walls are of an enormous strength, and enclose a space of  three miles. On each side of the road beyond the gate are built the  tombs. How unlike ours! They seem not so much hiding-places for that  which must decay, as voluptuous chambers for immortal spirits. They are  of marble, radiantly white; and two, especially beautiful, are loaded  with exquisite bas-reliefs. On the stucco-wall that encloses them are  little emblematic figures, of a relief exceedingly low, of dead and  dying animals, and little winged genii, and female forms bending in  groups in some funereal office. The high reliefs represent, one a  nautical subject, and the other a Bacchanalian one.    Within the cell stand the cinerary urns, sometimes one, sometimes more.  It is said that paintings were found within, which are now, as has been  everything movable in Pompeii, removed, and scattered about in royal  museums. These tombs were the most impressive things of all. The wild  woods surround them on either side; and along the broad stones of the  paved road which divides them, you hear the late leaves of autumn shiver  and rustle in the stream of the inconstant wind, as it were, like the  step of ghosts. The radiance and magnificence of these dwellings of the  dead, the white freshness of the scarcely-finished marble, the  impassioned or imaginative life of the figures which adorn them,  contrast strangely with the simplicity of the houses of those who were  living when Vesuvius overwhelmed them.    I have forgotten the amphitheater, which is of great magnitude, tho much  inferior to the Coliseum. I now understand why the Greeks were such  great poets; and, above all, I can account, it seems to me, for the  harmony, the unity, the perfection, the uniform excellence, of all their  works of art. They lived in a perpetual commerce with external nature,  and nourished themselves upon the spirit of its forms. Their theaters  were all open to the mountains and the sky. Their columns, the ideal  types of a sacred forest, with its roof of interwoven tracery, admitted  the light and wind; the odor and the freshness of the country penetrated  the cities. Their temples were mostly upaithric; and the flying clouds,  the stars, or the deep sky, were seen above.          VI    OTHER ITALIAN SCENES          VERONA[15]    BY CHARLES DICKENS      I had been half afraid to go to Verona, lest it should at all put me out  of conceit with Romeo and Juliet. But, I was no sooner come into the old  Market-place, than the misgiving vanished. It is so fanciful, quaint,  and picturesque a place, formed by such an extraordinary and rich  variety of fantastic buildings, that there could be nothing better at  the core of even this romantic town; scene of one of the most romantic  and beautiful of stories.    It was natural enough, to go straight from the Market-place, to the  House of the Capulets, now degenerated into a most miserable little inn.  Noisy vetturini and muddy market-carts were disputing possession of the  yard, which was ankle-deep in dirt, with a brood of splashed and  bespattered geese; and there was a grim-visaged dog, viciously panting  in a doorway, who would certainly have had Romeo by the leg, the moment  he put it over the wall, if he had existed and been at large in those  times. The orchard fell into other hands, and was parted off many years  ago; but there used to be one attached to the house--or at all events  there may have been--and the Hat (Cappello), the ancient cognizance of  the family, may still be seen, carved in stone, over the gateway of the  yard. The geese, the market-carts, their drivers, and the dog, were  somewhat in the way of the story, it must be confessed; and it would  have been pleasanter to have found the house empty, and to have been  able to walk through the disused rooms. But the Hat was unspeakably  comfortable; and the place where the garden used to be, hardly less so.  Besides, the house is a distrustful, jealous-looking house as one would  desire to see, tho of a very moderate size. So I was quite satisfied  with it, as the veritable mansion of old Capulet, and was  correspondingly grateful in my acknowledgments to an extremely  unsentimental middle-aged lady, the Padrona of the Hotel, who was  lounging on the threshold looking at the geese.    From Juliet's home, to Juliet's tomb, is a transition as natural to the  visitor, as to fair Juliet herself, or to the proudest Juliet that ever  has taught the torches to burn bright in any time. So, I went off, with  a guide, to an old, old garden, once belonging to an old, old convent, I  suppose; and being admitted, at a shattered gate, by a bright-eyed woman  who was washing clothes, went down some walks where fresh plants and  young flowers were prettily growing among fragments of old wall, and  ivy-covered mounds; and was shown a little tank, or water-trough, which  the bright-eyed woman--drying her arms upon her 'kerchief--called \"La  tomba di Giulietta la sfortunata.\" With the best disposition in the  world to believe, I could do no more than believe that the bright-eyed  woman believed; so I gave her that much credit, and her customary fee in  ready money. It was a pleasure, rather than a disappointment, that  Juliet's resting-place was forgotten. However consolatory it may have  been to Yorick's Ghost, to hear the feet upon the pavement overhead,  and, twenty times a day, the repetition of his name, it is better for  Juliet to lie out of the track of tourists, and to have no visitors but  such as come to graves in spring-rain, and sweet air, and sunshine.    Pleasant Verona! With its beautiful old palaces, and charming country in  the distance, seen from terrace walks, and stately, balustraded  galleries. With its Roman gates, still spanning the fair street, and  casting, on the sunlight of to-day, the shade of fifteen hundred years  ago. With its marble-fitted churches, lofty towers, rich architecture,  and quaint old quiet thoroughfares, where shouts of Montagues and  Capulets once resounded.      And made Verona's ancient citizens    Cast by their grave, beseeming ornaments,    To wield old partisans.    With its fast-rushing river, picturesque old bridge, great castle,  waving cypresses, and prospect so delightful, and so cheerful! Pleasant  Verona! In the midst of it, in the Piazza di Bra--a spirit of old time  among the familiar realities of the passing hour--is the great Roman  Amphitheater. So well preserved, and carefully maintained, that every  row of seats is there, unbroken. Over certain of the arches, the old  Roman numerals may yet be seen; and there are corridors, and staircases,  and subterranean passages for beasts, and winding ways, above ground and  below, as when the fierce thousands hurried in and out, intent upon the  bloody shows of the arena. Nestling in some of the shadows and hollow  places of the walls, now, are smiths with their forges, and a few small  dealers of one kind or other; and there are green weeds, and leaves, and  grass, upon the parapet. But little else is greatly changed.    When I had traversed all about it, with great interest, and had gone up  to the topmost round of seats, and turning from the lovely panorama  closed in by the distant Alps, looked down into the building, it seemed  to lie before me like the inside of a prodigious hat of plaited straw,  with an enormously broad brim and a shallow crown; the plaits being  represented by the four-and-forty rows of seats. The comparison is a  homely and fantastic one, in sober remembrance and on paper, but it was  irresistibly suggested at the moment, nevertheless.          PADUA[16]    BY THEOPHILE GAUTIER      Padua is an ancient city and exhibits a rather respectable appearance  against the horizon with its bell-turrets, its domes, and its old walls  upon which myriads of lizards run and frisk in the sun. Situated near a  center which attracts life to itself, Padua is a dead city with an  almost deserted air. Its streets, bordered by two rows of low arcades,  in nowise recall the elegant and charming architecture of Venice. The  heavy, massive structures have a serious, somewhat crabbed aspect, and  its somber porticos in the lower stories of the houses resemble black  mouths which yawn with ennui.    We were conducted to a big inn, established probably in some ancient  palace, and whose great halls, dishonored by vulgar uses, had formerly  seen better company. It was a real journey to go from the vestibule to  our room by a host of stairways and corridors; a map of Ariadne's thread "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#9)"],[1," wolf is dead!\" they cried, and taking hands, they  danced with their mother all about the place.    [Illustration: FAITHFUL JOHN    \"IT HAPPENED, AS THEY WERE STILL  JOURNEYING ON THE OPEN SEA, THAT  FAITHFUL JOHN, AS HE SAT IN THE FORE  PART OF THE SHIP, & MADE MUSIC, CAUGHT  SIGHT OF THREE RAVENS FLYING OVERHEAD.  THEN HE STOPPED PLAYING &  LISTENED TO WHAT THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER\"]          FAITHFUL JOHN      THERE was once an old King, who, having fallen sick, thought to himself,  \"This is very likely my death-bed on which I am lying.\"    Then he said, \"Let Faithful John be sent for.\"    Faithful John was his best-beloved servant, and was so called because he  had served the King faithfully all his life long. When he came near the  bed, the King said to him,    \"Faithful John, I feel my end drawing near, and my only care is for my  son; he is yet of tender years, and does not always know how to shape  his conduct; and unless you promise me to instruct him in all his  actions and be a true foster-father to him, I shall not be able to close  my eyes in peace.\"    Then answered Faithful John, \"I will never forsake him, and will serve  him faithfully, even though it should cost me my life.\"    And the old King said, \"Then I die, being of good cheer and at peace.\"  And he went on to say,    \"After my death, you must lead him through the whole castle, into all  the chambers, halls, and vaults, and show him the treasures that in them  lie; but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which lies hidden the  picture of the Princess of the Golden Palace, you must not show him. If  he were to see that picture, he would directly fall into so great a love  for her, that he would faint with the strength of it, and afterwards for  her sake run into great dangers; so you must guard him well.\"    And as Faithful John gave him his hand upon it, the old King became  still and silent, laid his head upon the pillow, and died.    When the old King was laid in the grave, Faithful John told the young  King what he had promised to his father on his death-bed, and said,    \"And I will certainly hold to my promise and be faithful to you, as I  was faithful to him, even though it should cost me my life.\"    When the days of mourning were at an end, Faithful John said to the  Prince,    \"It is now time that you should see your inheritance; I will show you  all the paternal castle.\"    Then he led him over all the place, upstairs and down-stairs, and showed  him all the treasures and the splendid chambers; one chamber only he did  not open, that in which the perilous picture hung. Now the picture was  so placed that when the door opened it was the first thing to be seen,  and was so wonderfully painted that it seemed to breathe and move, and  in the whole world was there nothing more lovely or more beautiful. The  young King noticed how Faithful John always passed by this one door, and  asked,    \"Why do you not undo this door?\"    \"There is something inside that would terrify you,\" answered he. But the  King answered,    \"I have seen the whole castle, and I will know what is in here also.\"  And he went forward and tried to open the door by force.    Then Faithful John called him back, and said, \"I promised your father on  his death-bed that you should not see what is in that room; it might  bring great misfortune on you and me were I to break my promise.\"    But the young King answered, \"I shall be undone if I do not go inside  that room; I shall have no peace day or night until I have seen it with  these eyes; and I will not move from this place until you have unlocked  it.\"    Then Faithful John saw there was no help for it, and he chose out the  key from the big bunch with a heavy heart and many sighs. When the door  was opened he walked in first, and thought that by standing in front of  the King he might hide the picture from him, but that was no good, the  King stood on tiptoe, and looked over his shoulder. And when he saw the  image of the lady that was so wonderfully beautiful, and so glittering  with gold and jewels, he fell on the ground powerless. Faithful John  helped him up, took him to his bed, and thought with sorrow, \"Ah me! the  evil has come to pass; what will become of us?\"    Then he strengthened the King with wine, until he came to himself. The  first words that he said were,    \"Oh, the beautiful picture! whose portrait is it?\"    \"It is the portrait of the Princess of the Golden Palace,\" answered  Faithful John. Then the King said,    \"My love for her is so great that if all the leaves of the forest were  tongues they could not utter it! I stake my life on the chance of  obtaining her, and you, my Faithful John, must stand by me.\"    The faithful servant considered for a long time how the business should  be begun; it seemed to him that it would be a difficult matter to come  only at a sight of the Princess. At last he thought out a way, and said  to the King,    \"All that she has about her is of gold--tables, chairs, dishes,  drinking-cups, bowls, and all the household furniture; in your treasury  are five tons of gold, let the goldsmiths of your kingdom work it up  into all kinds of vessels and implements, into all kinds of birds, and  wild creatures, and wonderful beasts, such as may please her; then we  will carry them off with us, and go and seek our fortune.\"    The King had all the goldsmiths fetched, and they worked day and night,  until at last some splendid things were got ready. When a ship had been  loaded with them, Faithful John put on the garb of a merchant, and so  did the King, so as the more completely to disguise themselves. Then  they journeyed over the sea, and went so far that at last they came to  the city where the Princess of the Golden Palace dwelt.    Faithful John told the King to stay in the ship, and to wait for him.    \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"I shall bring the Princess back with me, so take  care that everything is in order; let the golden vessels be placed  about, and the whole ship be adorned.\"    Then he gathered together in his apron some of the gold things, one of  each kind, landed, and went up to the royal castle. And when he reached  the courtyard of the castle there stood by the well a pretty maiden, who  had two golden pails in her hand, and she was drawing water with them;  and as she turned round to carry them away she saw the strange man, and  asked him who he was. He answered,    \"I am a merchant,\" and opened his apron, and let her look within it.    \"Ah, what beautiful things!\" cried she, and setting down her pails, she  turned the golden toys over, and looked at them one after another: then  she said,    \"The Princess must see these; she takes so much pleasure in gold things  that she will buy them all from you.\"    Then she took him by the hand and led him in, for she was the  chamber-maid.    When the Princess saw the golden wares she was very pleased, and said,    \"All these are so finely worked that I should like to buy them of you.\"    But the faithful John said,    \"I am only the servant of a rich merchant, and what I have here is  nothing to what my master has in the ship--the cunningest and costliest  things that ever were made of gold.\"    The Princess then wanted it all to be brought to her; but he said,    \"That would take up many days; so great is the number of them, and so  much space would they occupy that there would not be enough room for  them in your house.\"    But the Princess's curiosity and fancy grew so much that at last she  said,    \"Lead me to the ship; I will myself go and see your master's treasures.\"    Then Faithful John led her to the ship joyfully, and the King, when he  saw that her beauty was even greater than the picture had set forth,  felt his heart leap at the sight. Then she climbed up into the ship, and  the King received her. Faithful John stayed by the steersman, and gave  orders for the ship to push off, saying, \"Spread all sail, that she may  fly like a bird in the air.\"    So the King showed her all the golden things, each separately--the  dishes, the bowls, the birds, the wild creatures, and the wonderful  beasts. Many hours were passed in looking at them all, and in her  pleasure the Princess never noticed that the ship was moving onwards.  When she had examined the last, she thanked the merchant, and prepared  to return home; but when she came to the ship's side, she saw that they  were on the high seas, far from land, and speeding on under full sail.    \"Ah!\" cried she, full of terror, \"I am betrayed and carried off by this  merchant. Oh that I had died rather than have fallen into his power!\"    But the King took hold of her hand, and said,    \"No merchant am I, but a King, and no baser of birth than thyself; it is  because of my over-mastering love for thee that I have carried thee off  by cunning. The first time I saw thy picture I fell fainting to the  earth.\"    When the Princess of the Golden Palace heard this she became more  trustful, and her heart inclined favourably towards him, so that she  willingly consented to become his wife.    It happened, however, as they were still journeying on the open sea,  that Faithful John, as he sat in the forepart of the ship and made  music, caught sight of three ravens in the air flying overhead. Then he  stopped playing, and listened to what they said one to another, for he  understood them quite well. The first one cried,    \"Ay, there goes the Princess of the Golden Palace.\"    \"Yes,\" answered the second; \"but he has not got her safe yet.\" And the  third said,    \"He has her, though; she sits beside him in the ship.\"    Then the first one spoke again,    \"What does that avail him? When they come on land a fox-red horse will  spring towards them; then will the King try to mount him; and if he  does, the horse will rise with him into the air, so that he will never  see his bride again.\" The second raven asked,    \"Is there no remedy?\"    \"Oh yes; if another man mounts"]]]
