All, however, agreed in wishing that the emperor had been blessed with  two such handsome princes, and said that his children would have been  about the same age, if the queen had not been so unfortunate as to lose  them.    The first thing the emperor did when he arrived at his palace was to  conduct the princes into the principal apartments, who praised without  affectation the beauty and symmetry of the rooms, and the richness of  the furniture and ornaments. Afterward a magnificent repast was served  up, and the emperor made them sit with him, which they at first refused;  but finding it was his pleasure, they obeyed.    The emperor, who had himself much learning, particularly in history,  foresaw that the princes, out of modesty and respect, would not take the  liberty of beginning any conversation. Therefore, to give them an  opportunity, he furnished them with subjects all dinner-time. But  whatever subject he introduced, they shewed so much wit, judgment, and  discernment, that he was struck with admiration. \"Were these my own  children,\" said he to himself, \"and I had improved their talents by  suitable education, they could not have been more accomplished or better  informed.\" In short, he took such great pleasure in their conversation,  that, after having sat longer than usual, he led them into his closet,  where he pursued his conversation with them, and at last said: \"I never  supposed that there were among my subjects in the country youths so well  brought up, so lively, so capable; and I never was better pleased with  any conversation than yours; but it is time now we should relax our  minds with some diversion; and as nothing is more capable of enlivening  the mind than music, you shall hear a vocal and instrumental concert  which may not be disagreeable to you.\"    The emperor had no sooner spoken than the musicians, who had orders to  attend, entered, and answered fully the expectations the princes had  been led to entertain of their abilities. After the concerts, an  excellent farce was acted, and the entertainment was concluded by  dancers of both sexes.    The two princes, seeing night approach, prostrated themselves at the  emperor's feet; and having first thanked him for the favours and honours  he had heaped upon them, asked his permission to retire; which was  granted by the emperor, who, in dismissing them, said: \"I give you leave  to go; but remember, you will be always welcome, and the oftener you  come the greater pleasure you will do me.\"    Before they went out of the emperor's presence, Prince Bahman said:  \"Sir, may we presume to request that your majesty will do us and our  sister the honour to pass by our house, and refresh yourself after your  fatigue, the first time you take the diversion of hunting in that  neighbourhood? It is not worthy of your presence; but monarchs sometimes  have vouchsafed to take shelter in a cottage.\" \"My children,\" replied  the emperor, \"your house cannot be otherwise than beautiful and worthy  of its owners. I will call and see it with pleasure, which will be the  greater for having for my hosts you and your sister, who is already dear  to me from the account you give me of the rare qualities with which she  is endowed: and this satisfaction I will defer no longer than to-morrow.  Early in the morning I will be at the place where I shall never forget  that I first saw you. Meet me, and you shall be my guides.\"    When the Princes Bahman and Perviz had returned home, they gave the  princess an account of the distinguished reception the emperor had given  them, and told her that they had invited him to do them the honour, as  he passed by, to call at their house, and that he had appointed the next  day.    \"If it be so,\" replied the princess, \"we must think of preparing a  repast fit for his majesty; and for that purpose I think it would be  proper we should consult the Talking Bird, who will tell us, perhaps,  what meats the emperor likes best.\" The princes approved of her plan,  and after they had retired she consulted the Bird alone. \"Bird,\" said  she, \"the emperor will do us the honour to-morrow to come and see our  house, and we are to entertain him; tell us what we shall do to acquit  ourselves to his satisfaction.\"    \"Good mistress,\" replied the Bird, \"you have excellent cooks, let them  do the best they can; but above all things, let them prepare a dish of  cucumbers stuffed full of pearls, which must be set before the emperor  in the first course before all the other dishes.\"    \"Cucumbers stuffed full of pearls!\" cried Princess Periezade with  amazement; \"surely, Bird, you do not know what you say; it is an unheard  of dish. The emperor may admire it as a piece of magnificence, but he  will sit down to eat, and not to admire pearls; besides, all the pearls  I possess are not enough for such a dish.\"    \"Mistress,\" said the Bird, \"do what I say, and be not uneasy about what  may happen. Nothing but good will follow. As for the pearls, go early  to-morrow morning to the foot of the first tree on your right hand in  the park, dig under it, and you will find more than you want.\"    That night the princess ordered a gardener to be ready to attend her,  and the next morning early, led him to the tree which the Bird had told  her of, and bade him dig at its foot. When the gardener came to a  certain depth, he found some resistance to the spade, and presently  discovered a gold box about a foot square, which he showed the princess.  \"This,\" said she, \"is what I brought you for; take care not to injure it  with the spade.\"    When the gardener took up the box, he gave it into the princess's hands,  who, as it was only fastened with neat little hasps, soon opened it, and  found it full of pearls of a moderate size, but equal and fit for the  use that was to be made of them. Very well satisfied with having found  this treasure, after she had shut the box again, she put it under her  arm and went back to the house, while the gardener threw the earth into  the hole at the foot of the tree as it had been before.    The Princes Bahman and Perviz, who, as they were dressing themselves in  their own apartments, saw their sister in the garden earlier than usual,  as soon as they could get out went to her, and met her as she was  returning with a gold box under her arm, which much surprised them.  \"Sister,\" said Bahman, \"you carried nothing with you when we saw you  before with the gardener, and now we see you have a golden box; is this  some treasure found by the gardener, and did he come and tell you of  it?\"    \"No, brother,\" answered the princess, \"I took the gardener to the place  where this casket was concealed, and showed him where to dig; but you  will be more amazed when you see what it contains.\"    The princess opened the box, and when the princes saw that it was full  of pearls, which, though small, were of great value, they asked her how  she came to the knowledge of this treasure. \"Brothers,\" said she, \"come  with me and I will tell you.\" The princess, as they returned to the  house, gave them an account of her having consulted the Bird, as they  had agreed she should, and the answer he had given her; the objection  she had raised to preparing a dish of cucumbers stuffed full of pearls,  and how he had told her where to find this box. The sister and brothers  formed many conjectures to penetrate into what the Bird could mean by  ordering them to prepare such a dish; but after much conversation, they  agreed to follow his advice exactly.    As soon as the princess entered the house, she called for the head cook;  and after she had given him directions about the entertainment for the  emperor, said to him: \"Besides all this, you must dress an extraordinary  dish for the emperor's own eating, which nobody else must have anything  to do with besides yourself. This dish must be of cucumbers stuffed with  these pearls;\" and at the same time she opened him the box, and showed  him the jewels.    The chief cook, who had never heard of such a dish, started back, and  showed his thoughts by his looks; which the princess penetrating, said:  \"I see you take me to be mad to order such a dish, which one may say  with certainty was never made. I know this as well as you; but I am not  mad, and give you these orders with the most perfect recollection. You  must invent and do the best you can, and bring me back what pearls are  left.\" The cook could make no reply, but took the box and retired; and  afterward the princess gave directions to all the domestics to have  everything in order, both in the house and gardens, to receive the  emperor.    Next day the two princes went to the place appointed, and as soon as the  emperor of Persia arrived the chase began and lasted till the heat of  the sun obliged him to leave off. While Prince Bahman stayed to conduct  the emperor to their house, Prince Perviz rode before to show the way,  and when he came in sight of the house, spurred his horse, to inform the  princess that the emperor was approaching; but she had been told by some  servants whom she had placed to give notice, and the prince found her  waiting ready to receive him.    When the emperor had entered the court-yard and alighted at the portico,  the princess came and threw herself at his feet, and the two princes  informed him she was their sister, and besought him to accept her  respects.    The emperor stooped to raise her, and after he had gazed some time on  her beauty, struck with her fine person and dignified air, he said: \"The  brothers are worthy of the sister, and she worthy of them; since, if I  may judge of her understanding by her person, I am not amazed that the  brothers would do nothing without their sister's consent; but,\" added  he, \"I hope to be better acquainted with you, my daughter, after I have  seen the house.\"    \"Sir,\" said the princess, \"it is only a plain country residence, fit for  such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#9)"],[1,"848, and the  floor laid in a combination of marble and encaustic tiles, with  borders of incised Portland stone, the incisions being filled with  coloured cement; the windows have been filled with stained glass by  Mr. Wilmshurst:         The east window, representing the Baptism of our Lord, by       John, after a picture by Bassans; given by the Rev. W.G.       Townley, of Upwell, Norfolk, as a memorial of his brother,       R.G. Townley, Esq., of Fulbourn, for several years one of       the representatives of the county in Parliament.         The subject of the other window is from the words of our       Lord, \"Suffer little children to come unto me;\" from a       picture by Overbeck: the gift of Canon Selwyn.    We now proceed on our course, and enter    +The Nave,+    which is of ample dimensions, being 203 feet in length; it has a  lighter appearance than many churches of Norman architecture, and may  be considered a late specimen of that style, having been finished  about 1174. The length originally comprised thirteen bays, one of  which has been included in the plan of the Octagon; there are no  single cylindrical columns as in many churches, but the pillars are  clustered and alternate in size and pattern; the arches appear to be  somewhat higher than semicircular, being stilted, or some little way  rectilinear before they take the circular bend. Those of the second  tier comprehend in each two smaller ones, supported by a much lighter  column; each compartment in the upper tier is divided into three small  arches, the middle one being larger and higher than that on either  side of it. Over the whole aisle on each side runs a broad gallery  usually called the \"triforium,\" lighted by Perpendicular windows in  the outer wall; and above is the \"clerestory,\" or \"clear-story,\"  affording a narrow passage in the thickness of the main wall, lighted  by the original Norman windows; thus the height is divided into three  parts--ground-story, triforium, and clerestory; and the breadth into  the same number--nave, north aisle, and south aisle; probably designed  as a type of the Trinity, as it is thought by many that these  symbolical considerations were used in the building of churches in  early ages.    A new floor has been laid in the Nave[29] in a design which introduces  several kinds of stone and marble, each bay in a pattern differing  from the adjoining one; the large slab of marble which laid in the  second bay from the east, and from which the memorial brass has long  disappeared, remains _in situ_, it is not known to whose memory it was  originally placed, but evidently to some dignified ecclesiastic.  Towards the west the floor has been lowered so as to shew the bases of  the columns which had for many years been hidden. A semicircular  roof-shaft runs from the floor to the top of the wall between the  bays, but the roof, until lately, was open to view from the floor to  the rafters; a new painted ceiling has been executed,[30] which adds  much to the grandeur of the building.    [Footnote 29: Bishop Turton by his will left the sum of L500 towards  this object, and Bishop Harold Browne gave a like sum towards the  completion of the paving of the Nave and aisles.]    [Footnote 30: A portion of the expense of this work was defrayed by a  bequest by the Rev. G. Millers, a Minor Canon, augmented by the  liberality of his Executors to L400.]    This ceiling was commenced in 1858, by Henry Styleman le Strange,  Esq., of Hunstanton Hall, and the six western bays were designed and  the chief parts executed by him, and finished in 1861; his lamented  decease in the following year gave rise to some fears as to its  completion, but his friend T. Gambier Parry, Esq., undertook to finish  the work so ably begun, as a token of affection to his memory, and it  now presents a beautiful series of pictures in compartments, forming,  as it were, a carefully studied epitome of the sacred history of man  as recorded in Holy Scripture; and exhibiting specimens of skill and  taste executed by two gentlemen of independent fortune that may be  almost considered marvellous.    It may be mentioned that the ceiling is upwards of 200 feet long, and  is 86 feet from the floor, and the general size of the principal  figures in the painting is nine feet.    The central subjects are arranged in chronological order from the  west, each being surrounded by a border varying in form, and  containing a legend; in the ten western bays the subjects are  supported by figures which are for the most part representations of  Patriarchs and Prophets, carrying scrolls[31] upon which are written  words of their own, bearing more or less forcibly upon the coming of  the Messiah. The eleventh subject has, properly speaking, no  supporters, but the Shepherds and the Magi are so arranged as to carry  on the artistic effect of a central group with conspicuous lateral  figures. In the twelfth and last subject, the picture extends entirely  across the ceiling; in the centre is the Lord Jesus in His glorified  humanity, seated on a throne, round about which is a \"rainbow like  unto an emerald.\" Above His head is the choir of Seraphim, painted in  prismatic colours, and reflected in the \"sea of glass before the  throne.\" On the right and left are the figures of the twelve apostles  seated; beyond them, on the dexter side, are two archangels, St.  Gabriel, \"the angel of redemption,\" holding the standard of the cross,  and St. Raphael, holding a sword with its point downwards, expressive  of victory and peace; at their feet rise three figures, typical of the  blessed received into glory. On the sinister side are also two  archangels, St. Uriel holding his sword downwards, and St. Michael  spearing the dragon, expressive of the condemnation of, and victory  over, sin. The figure of our Lord is connected with the tree of Jesse  by its last branches, which break into scrolls and golden fruit at His  feet.    [Footnote 31: In the key to the ceiling as represented in the two  following pages, we have placed the words of the legends under the  principal subjects, and the contents of the scrolls under the names of  the persons represented.]    The arch which separates the Nave from the Octagon has also been  decorated, as well as the wall which connects the arch with the  ceiling; the design contains the evangelistic symbols of St. Matthew  and St. John, and the text \"Blessed be the Name of His Majesty for  ever, and all the earth shall be filled with His Majesty. Amen and  Amen.\"    [Transcriber's Note: In the original book, the following text in  brackets is placed sideways along the right and left sides of a box  around the rest of the text.
