If the  crystallization takes place when the air is calm, the crystals will be  regularly formed; otherwise, when windy, I have seen them like a shell  within a shell, very thin, of a pearly whiteness. Professor Tyndall  has shown in a very beautiful manner that ice is but an agglomeration  of snow crystals: the transparency of the former being due to the  expulsion of the air, entrapped in and causing the whiteness and  opacity of the latter. There is a formation called the snow plant of  California, which arises to some height, and has been compared to  various things, a fountain convoluted and enlarged above, a  crystallized small bushy shrub, etc.; but on closer inquiry, I have  failed as yet to get any definite ideas to its true character. Some  bulbs in the soil might cause such formations by the congelation of  vapor deposited successively upon itself, or the stems of the previous  year's growth yet remaining, and thus give them a sheathing of  frosting.    The shape of a star is common in snow crystals, which we all know  assume the most beautiful forms, and which are illustrated in various  publications. The eminent botanist Count Swinoskoff should give us  some clue as to the genus or character of the plant, the flower of  which, we are told, melted away on being touched, and as to the  stamens, the diamond seeds like a pin's head, etc. The whole needs  further explanation.    I trust those Bostonians who are in such hope will edify the public as  to the final result of their experiment. What has that veteran in  botany, Dr. Asa Gray, to say about it? Let some one well qualified  tell us more about this frost flower of Russia.                                         J. Stauffer.  Lancaster, Pa.           *       *       *       *       *      PATENT MATTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.    _To the Editor of the Scientific American:_    From the report of the Commissioner of Patents, just issued, it  appears that its surplus revenue for the past year amounts to over one  hundred and five thousand dollars, and that there is nearly a million  dollars in the United States Treasury to the credit of the Patent  Office; and yet, notwithstanding that this enormous amount is lying  idle, our pseudo-economists at the Capitol refuse to grant the Office  sufficient of its own funds to carry on its business promptly. So much  is the work behindhand in some of the departments that, as the  Commissioner states in his report, some of the attorneys who require  certified copies of papers have been obliged to employ their own  clerks to do office copying, and then had to pay the full legal rate  of ten cents per hundred words, the same as though the Office had done  the work. This style of _economizing_, by making inventors pay two  prices for their work, may be \"reform\" in the eyes of the average  Democratic Congressman; but speaking for myself, as one of those who  have had to pay twice, I would prefer to dispense with this style of  \"retrenchment and reform,\" and therefore ask you, Messrs. Editors, in  behalf of the inventors of the United States, to so stir up our  legislators that they will allow the Office sufficient of its own  funds to do its work properly, and not delay the work of the  inventor--work that he has to pay for in advance--and so prevent the  discouragement and trouble which these delays always cause.    As the Patent Office has been doing a good business lately, there  appears to be some attempt at rivalry at the Capitol, as the following  list of applications for extension will show:    LIST OF APPLICANTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF PATENTS NOW BEFORE CONGRESS.      ---- Reynolds, power loom brake.

In addition to the above, I find the following names as applicants for  extensions, but the inventions covered by the patents sought to be  extended is not mentioned: S.S. Turner, Arculous Wyckoff, De Witt C.  Cummings, Moses Marshall, J.W. Fowler, and Holloway & Graham. Many of  the applicants have apparently given up their cases for this session,  but they may be only lying back to its close in hopes that in the  final rush their \"little bills\" may slip through easily.    Several bills tinkering at the patent laws are before Congress, and  one of these (House Bill, No. 3,370) passed the House on the 30th ult.  It has one section that may be made to work great harm to inventors,  as it prevents infringers being sued for more than one year's damages  previous to notice of infringement being given. By this bill, if it is  allowed to become a law, a person will be able to build and use  patented machines or processes for years in some out of the way place  where the inventor cannot easily find him; and should he be  discovered, he can only be sued for one year's damages. There are  other sections in this bill which will bear ventilating.    Another bill, introduced into the Senate by Mr. Paddock, provides that  all appeals from the Board of Appeals shall be direct to the Supreme  Court of the District of Columbia, instead of to the Commissioner as  heretofore; and that the fees shall be the same as now paid to the  latter official.    Mr. Sampson has introduced into the House a bill changing section 4886  so that it shall read as follows: \"SEC. 4886. Any person who has  discovered any new or useful art, machine, manufacture or composition  of matter, or any new or useful improvement thereof, not known or used  by others in this country, and not patented or described in any  printed publication in this or any foreign country, before his  invention or discovery thereof, and not in public use or on sale for  more than two years prior to his application, unless the same is  proved to have been abandoned, may, upon payment of the fees required  by law, and other due proceedings had, obtain a patent therefor:  _Provided, That the manufacture or composition of drugs as a medicine  shall not be patentable_.\" The change is the addition of the words in  italics.    The Smithsonian Institute has sent to Congress a memorial setting  forth that the present Institute building is already too small for the  vast amount of articles already placed there on exhibition; that at  the late Centennial Exposition the Commissioners of various countries  presented their entire collection of exhibits to the United States,  which had delegated their care to the Smithsonian Institute, and they  had no place for them; that the armory building was being fitted up  for the reception of the United States Centennial collection, and they  therefore asked that a building be erected for the foreign collection,  which could be used as a national museum, or otherwise we should have  to offend the donors by keeping their valuable gifts stowed away in  cellars and other rubbish receptacles.    Mr. Eads, who is now here on the lookout for his pay for his work on  the South Pass of the Mississippi's mouth, has received intelligence  from the resident engineer at the jetties that the channel through the  shoal at the head of the South Pass is now twenty-two feet deep, and  that the least width at which twenty feet depth is found is one  hundred and ten feet. The principal works to improve this shoal were  constructed during the last six months. The low stage and feeble  current of the river has delayed their effect until the recent flood  from the Ohio reached them, and the problem of deepening the shoal has  been fully solved by the rapid scouring away of the obstruction. It is  stated that the channel is quite straight and is deepening rapidly.  The channel through the jetties at the mouth of the Pass is twenty-one  feet deep. The entrance from the sea through the jetties is one  thousand feet wide, and through the works at the head of the Pass  eight hundred feet.    A recent telegram from Nevada states that the Sutro Tunnel (of which I  gave you some particulars in one of my letters) has now progressed a  total distance of 15,565 feet and has fairly entered the mineral belt,  and will soon help to increase the already vast products of the  Comstock lode.    While on the subject of mining, I will state that the amount of  quicksilver produced in California has increased so immensely during  the last two years that it has attracted the attention of all  interested in the article throughout the world. The receipts for the  year have been 63,928 and the exports 48,010 flasks. In addition to  the receipts there, probably about six thousand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19420"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of York (#9)"],[1,"is  known of the history of the vaults of the choir and eastern transepts.  Like those of the nave and transepts, they are of wood, though of the  same shape and design as a stone vault.    The great central tower was erected between 1400 and 1423. Hitherto  there had been the Early English tower of the elder John Romeyn,  supported by Norman piers which, perhaps, had received a partial casing  of Early English stonework. These piers were afterwards recased, not  simultaneously, but as the arches between them were erected, in the  following manner:--    Taking the south-western pier for an example: when the present nave was  begun, the western face of the pier was cased with masonry, so that  three parts still remained Norman; when the Decorated arch[1] in the  transept was erected south of it, it received a further Decorated casing  on its south side; when the central tower was built, its northern and  eastern faces were cased with Perpendicular masonry: so, in the case of  the north and south-eastern piers, their eastern faces were completely  cased when the choir was built, their western only when the tower was in  course of erection. To this day it may be seen that there is no bond  between the different periods of masonry, and that the courses are at  different levels.       [1] For the explanation of the erection of this Decorated arch,         see the architectural account of the transepts.    The piers were probably completely recased by 1409.    [Illustration: THE EAST END. From Britton.]    Nothing is known of the elder Romeyn's tower, or the manner in which the  present one replaced it. A great part of the new work has been  attributed to Walter Skirlawe, Bishop of Durham. It will be seen it is  of the same character as the lower part of the central tower at Durham.  It has never been finished, as the corners and the condition of the  masonry at the top still show, but it is impossible to say whether it  was intended to receive another storey, and if so, of what character  that other storey was to be. At one time, as may be seen in old  engravings, it had a turret in one corner, 24 feet high; this was  probably destroyed in the last century.    The south-west bell tower was built probably between 1433 and 1447, the  north-west between 1470 and 1474. They are thus both Perpendicular in  style.    At the end of the fifteenth century, therefore, the minster as we now  see it was fully built. Since that date it has suffered no changes of  importance, and the record is only one of occasional damage from fires  or fanaticism, and of necessary restorations.    The minster suffered to a certain extent at the restoration, and in a  less degree at the hands of the Puritans. In 1734 the nave was repaved.  Several tombs were found when the old pavement was removed, and relics  taken from them and deposited with the other treasures of the minster.    On the 2nd February 1829, Jonathan Martin, a brother of the apocalyptic  painter, John Martin, and a religious maniac, hid himself during evening  service behind the tomb of Archbishop Greenfield in the north transept,  and when the church was shut up for the night set fire to the choir. The  flames were not extinguished until the stalls, the organ, and the vault  had been entirely destroyed. The actual stonework and carving of the  choir were considerably injured, and the glass of the great east window  itself only just avoided destruction. Martin escaped through a window of  the transept, but was quickly captured, and discovered to be insane. The  restoration, carried on by Smirke, was begun in 1832, and on the whole  was fairly done. At any rate, the authorities of the minster may console  themselves with the knowledge that it was absolutely necessary. The  stalls were a reproduction, as exact as possible, of the old woodwork,  but the design of the throne and pulpit are original, and not  successful. The cost of the restoration was L65,000, most of which was  contributed by subscription. Timber, to the value of L5000, was given by  the State, and Sir Edward Vavasour, following the example of his  ancestor of the fourteenth century, supplied the stone.    Another fire broke out on the 30th May 1840. It began in the south-west  tower, and is said to have been caused by some workmen who were  repairing the clock. The whole tower, excepting its shell, including the  bells, was destroyed, and the fire was not extinguished until the wooden  vault of the nave had been burnt. The restoration on this occasion cost  L23,000, and was finished in a year, under the superintendence of Sydney  Smirke, son of the former restorer.    In 1871 the south transept was discovered to be in a dilapidated, and,  indeed, a dangerous condition, and the advice of Street was asked on the  question of restoring it. In his report he stated that the design of the  clerestory, constructed as it was of two thin walls, was not strong  enough for the weight it had to support, even though the vault was of  wood. The whole wall of the transept had given way, and the clerestory,  in particular, was in a very bad condition. It became necessary,  therefore, to rebuild the side walls of the clerestory and the flying  buttresses under the steep roofs of the aisles, to remove the heavy  slates from the roof, and to renew the pinnacles.    On investigation, it was discovered that the inside portion of the walls  had been made up of stone chippings without cement. It is curious that  builders in the thirteenth century, whose system of ornament was most  profuse and thorough, often scamped the more important details of  structure. At Peterborough, no less than at York, instances have been  discovered of what would, in these days, be called jerry-building.    The walls were rebuilt with solid masonry, held together by Portland  cement, and strengthened by wrought-iron bars; the Purbeck marble shafts  were in places renewed; the groining of the vault was stripped of the  whitewash which concealed its material; the lath and plaster work of the  vault between the groins was removed, and replaced by oak boarding; the  bosses were gilded, and picked out with vermilion paint.    The cost in all of this restoration was about L20,000. In the course of  it it was discovered that there were many remains of tombs and coffins  under the pavement, but they have not yet been thoroughly explored.    The reredos, made of terra-cotta and wood, was designed by Street, the  figures by Tinworth.    Modern stained glass windows have from time to time been placed in the  minster. In the last century a certain Pickett patched and rearranged  much of the older glass.          CHAPTER III    THE EXTERIOR      York Minster consists of a nave of eight bays and a choir of nine. It  has a large central tower and two western towers. The main transepts  project three bays from the nave and choir. There are also two eastern  transepts four bays west of the east end, which do not project beyond  the aisles of the choir. The chapter-house lies to the east of the  northern transept, and is connected with it by a lofty passage  projecting three bays from the transept. The east end of the cathedral  is square, as in most English Gothic churches. The best views are to be  obtained from the north, especially from the walls, which will be most  conveniently ascended at Bootham Bar, or from the extreme northern  corner of the close. From the walls the whole of the vast bulk of the  minster may be seen, broken by the great central tower and the lofty cap  of the chapter-house. Other English cathedrals are more finely placed,  several are richer in ornament, one or two have a more delicately varied  outline. None are so stately and so magnificent; and there is hardly a  church in Europe that appears so vast as the minster viewed from the  north. Compared with it the great French cathedrals, with their stilted  roofs so often unbroken, except by a small fleche and with their  outlines concealed in a crowd of flying buttresses, are apt to look  short and huddled when seen from a distance.    The low-pitched roof of the minster, the absence of flying buttresses,  and the simple and tranquil front of the north transept, give the  building an air of masculine and stately repose, and of perfect finish  seldom to be found in foreign churches; while the apparent uniformity of  style, though the architecture is of three different periods, frees it  from the picturesque inconsequence of many English cathedrals. Yet  neither inside nor outside does the minster appear to be the expression  of the spiritual aspirations of a people. It represents rather the  secular magnificence, the temporal power of a Church, that has played a  great part in the history of the nation. The archbishops of York have  been forced by circumstances to be militant prelates, contending with  Canterbury for precedence, leading armies against the Scotch, sometimes  even heading rebellions against the king; and in their cathedral they  have expressed their ambition and their pride.    #The West Front.#--The west front of York Minster is free from the two  faults most common to the facades of most English cathedrals. It is not  a mere undistinguished ending to the church, like those at Norwich and  Winchester, and it is not a magnificent misrepresentation of the height  or width of the building itself, like the west fronts at Peterborough  and Lincoln. Most of the English cathedrals are not lofty or wide enough  to give opportunities for an impressive facade, unless they are fronted  with a mere screen of masonry; but this is not the case at York. No  other Gothic church in England is so wide, and only Westminster Abbey is  as lofty. The builder, therefore, was not tempted to any expedient to  conceal the dimensions of his church, and so the front consists of the  natural end of the nave, of which a great part is filled by the west  window, with a gable above it representing the space"]]]
