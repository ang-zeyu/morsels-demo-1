Motherhood, surely, sat as lightly on her shoulders as fatherhood did on  Dan Barry, yet he felt a great pity as he looked at her, this flowerlike  beauty lost in the rocks and snow with only one man near her. She was  like music played without an audience except senseless things.    \"Yep, I'm a lot better,\" he answered, \"but it sure makes me terrible  sorry, ma'am, that I got your little girl in trouble. Mostly, it was my  fault.\"    She waved away all need of apology.    \"Don't think an instant about that, Mr. Gregg. Joan needs a great deal  of disciplining.\" She laughed a little. \"She has so much of her father  in her, you see. Now, are you strong enough to lift yourself higher in  the pillows?\"    They managed it between them, for he was weaker than he thought and when  he was padded into position with cushions she laid the tray across his  knees. His head swam at sight of it. Forty-eight hours of fasting had  sharpened his appetite, and the loaded tray whetted a razor edge, for a  great bowl of broth steamed forth an exquisite fragrance on one side  and beside it she lifted a napkin to let him peek at a slice of venison  steak. Then there was butter, yellow as the gold for which he had been  digging all winter, and real cream for his coffee--a whole pitcher of  it--and snowy bread. Best of all, she did not stay to embarrass him with  her watching while he ate, since above all things in the world a hungry  man hates observation when the board is spread.    Afterwards, consuming sleep rippled over him from his feet to his eyes  to his brain. He partially roused when the tray was removed, and the  pillows slipped from under his back, but with a vague understanding that  expert hands were setting the bed in order his senses fled once more.    Hours and hours later he opened his eyes in utter darkness with a thin,  sweet voice still ringing in his ears. He could not place himself until  he turned his head and saw a meager, broken, rectangular line of light  which was the door, and immediately afterwards the voice cried: \"Oh,  Daddy Dan! And what did the wolf do then?\"    \"I'm comin' to that, Joan, but don't you talk about wolves so loud or  old Black Bart'll think you're talkin' about him. See him lookin' at you  now?\"    \"But please go on. I won't say one little word.\"    The man's voice began again, softly, so that not a word was audible to  Gregg; he heard the crackle of burning logs upon the hearth; saw the  rectangle of light flicker; caught a faint scent of wood smoke, and then  he slept once more.        Chapter IX. The Long Arm Of The Law    From the first the wound healed rapidly, for Vic's blood was perfectly  pure, the mountain air a tonic which strengthened him, and his food and  care of the best. The high-powered rifle bullet whipped cleanly through  his shoulder, breaking no bone and tearing no ligament, and the flesh  closed swiftly. Even Vic's mind carried no burden to oppress him in care  for the future or regret for the past, for if he occasionally remembered  the limp body of Hansen on the floor of Captain Lorrimer's saloon he  could shrug the picture into oblivion. It had been fair fight, man to  man, with all the odds in favor of Blondy, who had been allowed to pull  his gun first. If Vic thought about the future at all, it was with a  blind confidence that some time and in some unrevealed way he would get  back to Alder and marry Betty Neal. In the meantime, as the days of the  spring went mildly by, he was up and about and very soon there was only  a little stiffness in his right arm to remind him of Pete Glass and the  dusty roan.    He spent most of his time close to the cabin, for though he had  forgotten the world there was no decisive proof that the world would  forget him half so easily; that was not the way of the sheriff. He had  been known to spend years in the hunt for a single misdoer and Vic  had no care to wander out where he might be seen. Besides, it was very  pleasant about the cabin. The house itself was built solidly, roomily,  out of logs hewn on the timbered slopes above and dragged down to this  little plateau. Three mountains, to the north, south and west, rolled  back and up, cutting away the sunlight in the early afternoon, but at  this point the quick slopes put out shoulders and made, among them, a  comfortable bit of rolling ground, deep soiled and fertile. Here, so  Kate Barry assured him, the wild flowers came even earlier than they did  in the valley so far below them, and to be sure when Vic first walked  from the house he found the meadow aflame with color except for the  space covered by the truck-garden and the corral. In that enclosure he  found Grey Molly fenced away from the black with several other horses of  commoner blood, for the stallion, he learned, recognized no fraternity  of horseflesh, but killed what he could reach. Grey Molly was quite  recovered from her long run, and she greeted him in her familiar way,  with ears flattened viciously.    He might have stayed on here quite happily for any space of time, but  more and more Vic felt that he was an intruder; he sensed it, rather  than received a hint of word or eye. In the first place the three were  complete in themselves, a triangle of happiness without need of another  member for variety or interest. It was plain at a glance that the girl  was whole-heartedly happy, and whatever incongruity lay between her and  these rough mountains he began to understand that her love for Barry and  the child made ample amends. As for the other two, he always thought  of them in the same instant, for if the child had her eyes and her hair  from her mother, she had her nature from the man. They were together  constantly, on walks up the mountain, when she rode Black Bart up the  steep places: on dips into the valley, when he carried her before him on  the stallion. She had the same soft voice, the same quick, furtive  ways, the same soundless laughter, at times; and when Barry sat in the  evening, as he often did for hours, staring at empty air, she would  climb on his knee, place his unresisting arm around her, and she looking  up into his face, sharing his silences. Sometimes Vic wondered if the  young mother were not troubled, made a little jealous by this perfect  companionship, but he never found a trace of it. It was she, finally,  who made him determine to leave as soon as his shoulder muscles moved  with perfect freedom, for as the days slipped past he felt that she grew  more and more uneasy, and her eyes had a way of going from him to her  husband as though she believed their guest a constant danger to Barry.  Indeed, to some small extent he was a danger, for the law might deal  hardly with a man who took a fugitive out of the very grip of its hand.    By a rather ironical chance, on the very morning when he decided that  he must start his journey the next day but one, Vic learned that he  must not linger even so long as that. Pete Glass and the law had not  forgotten him, indeed, nearly so well as he had forgotten the law and  Pete Glass, for as he sat in his room filling a pipe after breakfast  the voice of Barry called him out, and he found his host among the rocks  which rimmed the southern end of the plateau, in front of the house. To  the north the ground fell away smoothly, rolled down to the side of the  mountain, and then dipped easily to the valley--the only direction from  which the cabin was accessible, though here the grade was possible for a  buckboard. To the south the plateau ended in a drop that angled sharply  down, almost a cliff in places, and from this point of vantage the eye  carried nameless miles down the river.    \"Are them friends of yours?\" asked Dan Barry, as he stood among those  rocks. \"Take a long look.\" And he handed a strong pair of field glasses  to Gregg.    The latter peered over the dizzy edge. Down there, in the very act  of fording the river to get to their side of it, he marked five  horsemen--no, six, for he almost missed the leader of the troop, a dusty  figure which melted into the background. All the terror of the first  flight rushed back on Vic. He stood palsied, not in fear of that posse  but at the very thought of pursuit.    \"There's only one way,\" he stammered at length. \"I'll--Dan, give me a  hand to get a saddle on Grey Molly and I'll laugh at 'em yet. Damn 'em!\"    \"What you goin' to do?\" It was the same unhurried voice which had spoken  to Vic on the day of the rescue and it irritated him in the same manner  now. Kate had come running from the house with her apron fluttering.    \"I'm going down that slope to the north,\" said Vic, \"and I'll get by 'em  hell-bent-for-election. Once I show my heels to that lot they're done!\"    He talked as much to restore his courage as from, confidence, for if  the posse sighted him going down that slope on the gray it would take a  super-horseman and a super-horse to escape before they closed the gap.  Barry considered the situation with a new gleam in his eye.    \"Wait a minute,\" he said, as Vic started towards the corral. \"That way  you got planned is a good way--to die. You listen to me.\"    But here Kate broke in on them. \"Dan, what are you going to do?\"    \"I'm going to take the gray and go down the slope. I'm going to lead  'em off Vic's trail,\" said Barry quietly, but it seemed to Vic that he  avoided his wife's eye.    The voice of Betty Neal, Vic knew, would have risen shrill at a time  like this. Kate spoke even more low than usual, but there was a thing  in her voice that struck a tremor through Gregg. \"If it's death for him,  what is it for you?\"    \"Nothing at all. If they see me and head for me before the way's clear,  I'll let 'em come up and see they have the wrong man. If I get the  chance, I'll lead 'em away. And Vic, you'll hit between those two  mountains--see 'em?--and cut across"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#9)"],[1," treaty at Brest-Litovsk. Thereafter during the last months of the  war Russia was virtually an ally of its ancient enemy, Turkey, the \"Sick  Man of Europe,\" and the central German empires. With these allies the  Bolshevik government of Russia attempted to head off the Czecho-Slovak  regiments that had been captured by Russia during its drive into Austria  and had been imprisoned in Siberia. After the peace consummated at  Brest-Litovsk, these regiments determined to fight on the side of the  Allies and endeavored to make their way to the western front.    No war problems were more difficult than those of the Czecho-Slovaks.  Few have been handled so masterfully. Surrounded by powerful enemies  which for centuries have been bent on destroying every trace of Slavic  culture, they had learned how to defend themselves against every trick  or scheme of the brutal Germans.    The Czecho-Slovak plan in Russia was of great value to the Allies all  over the world, and was put at their service by Professor Thomas G.  Masaryk. He went to Russia when everything was adrift and got hold of  Bohemian prisoners here and there and organized them into a compact  little army of 50,000 to 60,000 men. Equipped and fed, he moved them to  whatever point had most power to thoroughly disrupt the German plans.  They did much to check the German army for months. They resolutely  refused to take any part in Russian political affairs, and when it  seemed no longer possible to work effectively in Russia this remarkable  little band started on a journey all round the world to get to the  western front. They loyally gave up most of their arms under agreement  with Lenine and Trotzky that they might peacefully proceed out of Russia  via Vladivostok.    While they were carrying out their part of the agreement, and well on  the way, they were surprised by telegrams from Lenine and Trotzky to the  Soviets in Siberia ordering them to take away their arms and intern  them.    The story of what occurred then was told by two American engineers,  Emerson and Hawkins, who, on the way to Ambassador Francis, and not  being able to reach Vologda, joined a band of four or five thousand. The  engineers were with them three months, while they were making it safe  along the lines of the railroad for the rest of the Czecho-Slovaks to  get out, and incidentally for Siberians to resume peaceful occupations.  They were also supported by old railway organizations which had stuck  bravely to them without wages and which every little while were \"shot  up\" by the Bolsheviki.    Distress in Russia would have been much more intense had it not been for  the loyalty of the railway men in sticking to their tasks. Some American  engineers at Irkutsk, on a peaceful journey out of Russia, on descending  from the cars were met with a demand to surrender, and shots from  machine guns. Some, fortunately, had kept hand grenades, and with these  and a few rifles went straight at the machine guns. Although  outnumbered, the attackers took the guns and soon afterward took the  town. The Czecho-Slovaks, in the beginning almost unarmed, went against  great odds and won for themselves the right to be considered a nation.    Seeing the treachery of Lenine and Trotzky, they went back toward the  west and made things secure for their men left behind. They took town  after town with the arms they first took away from the Bolsheviki and  Germans; but in every town they immediately set up a government, with  all the elements of normal life. They established police and sanitary  systems, opened hospitals, and had roads repaired, leaving a handful of  men in the midst of enemies to carry on the plans of their leaders.  American engineers speaking of the cleanliness of the Czecho-Slovak  army, said that they lived like Spartans.    The whole story is a remarkable evidence of the struggle of these little  people for self-government.    The emergence of the Czecho-Slovak nation has been one of the most  remarkable and noteworthy features of the war. Out of the confusion of  the situation, with the possibility of the resurrection of oppressed  peoples, something of the dignity of old Bohemia was comprehended, and  it was recognized that the Czechs were to be rescued from Austria and  the Slovaks from Hungary, and united in one country with entire  independence. This was undoubtedly due, in large measure, to the  activities of Professor Masaryk, the president of the National Executive  Council of the Czecho-Slovaks. His four-year exile in the United States  had the establishment of the new nation as its fruit.    Professor Masaryk called attention to the fact that there is a peculiar  discrepancy between the number of states in Europe and the number of  nationalities--twenty-seven states to seventy nationalities. He  explained, also, that almost all the states are mixed, from the point of  nationality. From the west of Europe to the east, this is found to be  true, and the farther east one goes the more mixed do the states become.  Austria is the most mixed of all the states. There is no Austrian  language, but there are nine languages, and six smaller nations or  remnants of nations. In all of Germany there are eight nationalities  besides the Germans, who have been independent, and who have their own  literature. Turkey is an anomaly, a combination of various nations  overthrown and kept down.    Since the eighteenth century there has been a continuing strong movement  from each nation to have its own state. Because of the mixed peoples,  there is much confusion. There are Roumanians in Austria, but there is a  kingdom of Roumania. There are Southern Slavs, but there are also Serbia  and Montenegro. It is natural that the Southern Slavs should want to be  united as one state. So it is with Italy.    There was no justice in Poland being separated in three parts to serve  the dynasties of Prussia, Russia and Austria. The Czecho-Slovaks of  Austria and Hungary claimed a union. The national union consists in an  endeavor to make the suppressed nations free, to unite them in their own  states, and to readjust the states that exist; to force Austria and  Prussia to give up the states that should be free.    In the future, said Doctor Masaryk, there are to be sharp ethnological  boundaries. The Czecho-Slovaks will guarantee the minorities absolute  equality, but they will keep the German part of their country, because  there are many Bohemians in it and they do not trust the Germans.        CHAPTER IV    THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES    One factor alone caused the great war. It was not the assassination at  Sarajevo, not the Slavic ferment of anti-Teutonism in Austria and the  Balkans. The only cause of the world's greatest war was the  determination of the German High Command and the powerful circle  surrounding it that \"Der Tag\" had arrived. The assassination at Sarajevo  was only the peg for the pendant of war. Another peg would have been  found inevitably had not the projection of that assassination presented  itself as the excuse.    Germany's military machine was ready. A gray-green uniform that at a  distance would fade into misty obscurity had been devised after  exhaustive experiments by optical, dye and cloth experts co-operating  with the military high command. These uniforms had been standardized and  fitted for the millions of men enrolled in Germany's regular and reserve  armies. Rifles, great pyramids of munitions, field kitchens, traveling  post-offices, motor lorries, a network of military railways leading to  the French and Belgian border, all these and more had been made ready.  German soldiers had received instructions which enabled each man at a  signal to go to an appointed place where he found everything in  readiness for his long forced marches into the territory of Germany's  neighbors.    More than all this, Germany's spy system, the most elaborate and  unscrupulous in the history of mankind, had enabled the German High  Command to construct in advance of the declaration of war concrete gun  emplacements in Belgium and other invaded territory. The cellars of  dwellings and shops rented or owned by German spies were camouflaged  concrete foundations for the great guns of Austria and Germany. These  emplacements were in exactly the right position for use against the  fortresses of Germany's foes. Advertisements and shop-signs were used by  spies as guides for the marching German armies of invasion.      [Illustration: Painting of KAISER WILLIAM II.]    Copyright Press Illustrating Service.

To forgive him and to forget his terrible transgressions    would be to condone them.    [Illustration: Men marching past a band.]    Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N, Y.
