Put it into a clean cask       and add the other ingredients. The cask is then to be well bunged,       and kept in a cool place for two or three months; then bottle it       and keep it cool for a month longer, when it will be fit for use.       If it should not be perfectly clear after standing in the cask two       or three months, it should be rendered so by the use of isinglass.       By adding 1 lb. of fresh or preserved strawberries, and 2 ounces of       powdered cochineal, the PINK _Champagne may be made_.\"           _Southampton Port._[32]--\"Take cyder, 36 gallons; elder wine, 11       gallons; brandy, 5 gallons; damson wine, 11 gallons; mix.\"    The particular and separate department in this factitious wine trade,  called _crusting_, consists in lining the interior surface of empty  wine-bottles, in part, with a red crust of super-tartrate of potash, by  suffering a saturated hot solution of this salt, coloured red with a  decoction of Brazil-wood, to crystallize within them; and after this  simulation of maturity is perfected, they are filled with the compound  called Port wine.    Other artisans are regularly employed in staining the lower extremities  of bottle-corks with a fine red colour, to appear, on being drawn, as if  they had been long in contact with the wine.    The preparation of an astringent extract, to produce, from spoiled  home-made and foreign wines, a \"genuine old Port,\" by mere admixture; or  to impart to a weak wine a rough austere taste, a fine colour, and a  peculiar flavour; forms one branch of the business of particular  wine-coopers: while the mellowing and restoring of spoiled white wines,  is the sole occupation of men who are called _refiners of wine_.    We have stated that a crystalline crust is formed on the interior  surface of bottles, for the purpose of misleading the unwary into a  belief that the wine contained in them is of a certain age. A  correspondent operation is performed on the wooden cask; the whole  interior of which is stained artificially with a crystalline crust of  super-tartrate of potash, artfully affixed in a manner precisely similar  to that before stated. Thus the wine-merchant, after bottling off a  pipe of wine, is enabled to impose on the understanding of his  customers, by taking to pieces the cask, and exhibiting the beautiful  dark coloured and fine crystalline crust, as an indubitable proof of the  age of the wine; a practice by no means uncommon, to flatter the vanity  of those who pride themselves in their acute discrimination of wines.    These and many other sophistications, which have long been practised  with impunity, are considered as legitimate by those who pride  themselves for their skill in the art of _managing_, or, according to  the familiar phrase, _doctoring_ wines. The plea alleged in exculpation  of them, is, that, though deceptive, they are harmless: but even  admitting this as a palliation, yet they form only one department of an  art which includes other processes of a tendency absolutely criminal.    Several well-authenticated facts have convinced me that the adulteration  of wine with substances deleterious to health, is certainly practised  oftener than is, perhaps, suspected; and it would be easy to give some  instances of very serious effects having arisen from wines contaminated  with deleterious substances, were this a subject on which I meant to  speak. The following statement is copied from the Monthly Magazine for  March 1811, p. 188.    \"On the 17th of January, the passengers by the Highflyer coach, from the  north, dined, as usual, at Newark. A bottle of Port wine was ordered; on  tasting which, one of the passengers observed that it had an unpleasant  flavour, and begged that it might be changed. The waiter took away the  bottle, poured into a fresh decanter half the wine which had been  objected to, and filled it up from another bottle. This he took into the  room, and the greater part was drank by the passengers, who, after the  coach had set out towards Grantham, were seized with extreme sickness;  one gentleman in particular, who had taken more of the wine than the  others, it was thought would have died, but has since recovered. The  half of the bottle of wine sent out of the passengers' room, was put  aside for the purpose of mixing negus. In the evening, Mr. Bland, of  Newark, went into the hotel, and drank a glass or two of wine and water.  He returned home at his usual hour, and went to bed; in the middle of  the night he was taken so ill, as to induce Mrs. Bland to send for his  brother, an apothecary in the town; but before that gentleman arrived,  he was dead. An inquest was held, and the jury, after the fullest  enquiry, and the examination of the surgeons by whom the body was  opened, returned a verdict of--_Died by Poison._\"    The most dangerous adulteration of wine is by some preparations of lead,  which possess the property of stopping the progress of acescence of  wine, and also of rendering white wines, when muddy, transparent. I have  good reason to state that lead is certainly employed for this purpose.  The effect is very rapid; and there appears to be no other method known,  of rapidly recovering ropy wines. Wine merchants persuade themselves  that the minute quantity of lead employed for that purpose is perfectly  harmless, and that no atom of lead remains in the wine. Chemical  analysis proves the contrary; and the practice of clarifying spoiled  white wines by means of lead, must be pronounced as highly deleterious.    Lead, in whatever state it be taken into the stomach, occasions terrible  diseases; and wine, adulterated with the minutest quantity of it,  becomes a slow poison. The merchant or dealer who practises this  dangerous sophistication, adds the crime of murder to that of fraud, and  deliberately scatters the seeds of disease and death among those  consumers who contribute to his emolument. If to debase the current  coin of the realm be denounced as a capital offence, what punishment  should be awarded against a practice which converts into poison a liquor  used for sacred purposes.    Dr. Watson[33] relates, that the method of adulterating wine with lead,  was at one time a common practice in Paris.    Dr. Warren[34] states an instance of thirty-two persons having become  severely ill, after drinking white wine that had been adulterated with  lead. One of them died, and one became paralytic.    In Graham's Treatise on Wine-Making,[35] under the article of _Secrets_,  belonging to the mysteries of vintners, p. 31, lead is recommended to  prevent wine from becoming acid. The following lines are copied from Mr.  Graham's work:          \"_To hinder Wine from turning._        \"Put a pound of melted lead, in fair water, into your cask, pretty      warm, and stop it close.\"          \"_To soften Grey Wine._        \"Put in a little vinegar wherein litharge has been well steeped, and      boil some honey, to draw out the wax. Strain it through a cloth, and      put a quart of it into a tierce of wine, and this will mend it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The ancients knew that lead rendered harsh wines milder, and preserved  it from acidity, without being aware that it was pernicious: it was  therefore long used with confidence; and when its effects were  discovered, they were not ascribed to that metal, but to some other  cause.[36] When the Greek and Roman wine merchants wished to try whether  their wine was spoiled, they immersed in it a plate of lead;[37] if the  colour of the lead were corroded, they concluded that their wine was  spoiled. Wine may become accidentally impregnated with lead.    It is well known that bottles in which wine has been kept, are usually  cleaned by means of shot, which by its rolling motion detaches the  super-tartrate of potash from the sides of the bottles. This practice,  which is generally pursued by wine-merchants, may give rise to serious  consequences, as will become evident from the following case:[38]    \"A gentleman who had never in his life experienced a day's illness, and  who was constantly in the habit of drinking half a bottle of Madeira  wine after his dinner, was taken ill, three hours after dinner, with a  severe pain in the stomach and violent bowel colic, which gradually  yielded within twelve hours to the remedies prescribed by his medical  adviser. The day following he drank the remainder of the same bottle of  wine which was left the preceding day, and within two hours afterwards  he was again seized with the most violent colliquative pains, headach,  shiverings, and great pain over the whole body. His apothecary becoming  suspicious that the wine he had drank might be the cause of the  disease, ordered the bottle from which the wine had been decanted to be  brought to him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#9)"],[1,"ment. We Americans are the political  heirs of the latter, not of the former, revolution.    Germany was stirred slightly to hope for freedom, but stirred mightily  to protest against anarchy later. These were the two influences from  the French Revolution that affected Germany, and they were so  contradictory that Germany herself was for nearly a hundred years in a  mixed mood. One influence enlivened the theoretical democrat, and the  other sent the armies of all Europe post-haste to save what was left  of orderly government in France.    But Prussia was not what she had been under Frederick the Great.  Frederick was more Louis XIV than Louis XIV himself. The economic and  political errors of the French Revolution found their best practical  exponent in Frederick the Great. In the introduction to his code of  laws we have already mentioned are the words: \"The head of the state,  to whom is intrusted the duty of securing public welfare, which is the  whole aim of society, is authorized to direct and control all the  actions of individuals toward this end.\" Further on the same code  reads: \"It is incumbent upon the state to see to the feeding,  employment, and payment of all those who cannot support themselves,  and who have no claim to the help of the lord of the manor, or to the  help of the commune: it is necessary to provide such persons with work  which is suitable to their strength and their capacity.\"    When Frederick died he left Prussia in the grip of this enervating  pontifical socialism, which always everywhere ends by palsying the  individual, and through the individual the state, with the blight of  demagogical and theoretical legislation. The fine army grew pallid and  without spirit, the citizens lost their individual pride, the nation  as a whole lost its vigor, and when Napoleon marched into Berlin, he  remarked that the country hardly seemed worth conquering.    The century from the death of Frederick the Great, in 1786, to the  death of William the First, in 1888, includes, in a convenient period  to remember: the downfall of Frederick's patriotic edifice; the apathy  and impotency that followed upon the breaking up of the bureaucracy he  had welded into efficiency; the shuffling of the German states by  Napoleon as though they were the pack of cards in a great political  game; a revival of patriotism in Prussia after floggings and insults  that were past bearing; the jealousies and enmities of the various  states, the betrayal of one by the other, and finally the struggle  between Austria and Prussia to decide upon a leader for all Germany;  and at last the war against France, 1870-71, which was to make it  clear to the world that Germany had been Prussianized into an empire.    Frederick William II, the nephew of Frederick the Great, who succeeded  him, was King of Prussia from 1786 to 1797. Frederick William III, his  son, and the husband of the beautiful and patriotic Queen Louisa, was  King of Prussia from 1797 to 1840. Frederick William IV, a loquacious,  indiscreet, loose-lipped sovereign, of moist intellect and mythical  delusions, was King of Prussia from 1840 to 1857, when his mental  condition made his retirement necessary, and he was succeeded by his  brother, Frederick William Ludwig, first as regent, then as king in  1861, known to us as that admirable King and Emperor, William I, who  died in 1888.    Perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of these sovereigns, to  those of us who look upon Germany to-day as autocratically governed in  fact and by tradition, is their willing surrender to the people, on  every occasion when the demand has been, even as little insistent as  the German demand has been. In the case of Frederick William IV, his  claim, at least in words, upon his divine rights as a sovereign was  the mark of a wavering confidence in himself. He was not satisfied  with a rational sanction for his authority, but was forever assuring  his subjects that God had pronounced for him; much as men of low  intelligence attempt to add vigor to their statements by an oath. \"I  hold my crown,\" he said, \"by the favor of God, and I am responsible to  Him for every hour of my government.\" Much under the influence of the  two scholars Niebuhr and Ranke, he hated the ideas of the French  Revolution, and dreamed of an ideal Christian state like that of the  Middle Ages. He was caricatured by the journals of the day, and  laughed at by the wits, including Heine, and pictured as a king with  \"Order\" on one hand, \"Counter-order\" on the other, and \"Disorder\" on  his forehead.    Though Frederick William II marched into France in 1792, to support  the French monarchy, neither his army nor his people were prepared or  fit for this enterprise, and he soon retired. In 1793, Prussia joined  Russia in a second partition of Poland, but in 1795, angry with what  was considered the double dealing of Austria and Russia, Prussia  concluded a peace with France, the treaty of Basle was signed in 1795,  and for ten years Prussia practically took no part in the Napoleonic  wars.    Napoleon took over the lands on the left bank of the Rhine, took away  the freedom of forty-eight towns, leaving only Hamburg, Bremen,  Frankfort, Augsburg, and Nuremberg, and in 1803 he took Hanover.  Later, in 1805, Bavaria, Wuertemberg, and Baden aided Napoleon to fight  the alliance against him of Austria, England, Russia, and Sweden. In  that same year the Electors of Wuertemberg and Bavaria were made kings  by Napoleon. In 1806 Bavaria, Baden, Wuertemberg, and Hessen seceded  from the German Empire, formed themselves into the Confederation of  the Rhine, and acknowledged Napoleon as their protector. In 1806  Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, resigned, and there was  neither an empire nor an emperor of Germany, nor was there a Germany  of united interests.    In 1806 Frederick William III, driven by the grossest insults to his  country and to his wife, finally declared war against France; there  followed the battle of Jena, in which the Germans were routed, and in  that same year Napoleon marched into Berlin unopposed. In 1807 the  Russian Emperor was persuaded to make peace, and Prussia without her  ally was helpless. The Peace of Tilsit, in July, 1807, deprived  Prussia of the whole of the territory between the Elbe and the Rhine,  and this with Brunswick, Hessen-Cassel, and part of Hanover was dubbed  the Kingdom of Westphalia, and Napoleon's youngest brother Jerome was  made king. The Polish territory of Prussia was given to the Elector of  Saxony, who was also rewarded for having deserted Prussia after the  battle of Jena by being made a king. Prussia was further required to  reduce her army to forty-two thousand men.    It is neither a pretty nor an inspiriting story, this of the mangling  of Germany by Napoleon; of the German princes bribed by kingly crowns  from the hands of an ancestorless Corsican; but it all goes to show  how far from any sense of common aims and duties, how far from the  united Vaterland of to-day, was the Germany of a hundred years ago. It  adds, too, immeasurably to the laurels of the man who produced the  present German Empire out of his own pocket, and stood as chief  sponsor at its christening at Versailles in 1871.    This Prussia that sent twenty thousand troops to aid Napoleon against  Russia, and which during the retreat from Moscow went over bodily to  the enemy; this Prussia whose vacillating king simpered with delight  at a kind word from Napoleon, and shivered with dismay at a harsh one;  this army with its officers as haughty as they were incapable, and its  men only prevented from wholesale desertion by severe punishment, an  army rotten at the core, with a coat of varnish over its worm-eaten  fabric; this Prussia humiliated and disgraced after the battle of  Jena, in 1806, in seven years' time came into its own again. Vom  Stein, Scharnhorst, the son of a Hanoverian peasant, and Hardenberg  put new life into the state. At Waterloo the pummelled squares of red-coats  were relieved by these Prussians, and Bluecher, or \"Old Marschall  Vorwaerts\" as he was called, redeemed his countrymen's years of  effeminate lassitude and vacillation.    \"Such was Vorwaerts, such a fighter,  Such a lunging, plunging smiter,  Always stanch and always straight,  Strong as death for love or hate,  Always first in foulest weather,  Neck or nothing, hell for leather,  Through or over, sink or swim,  Such was Vorwaerts--here's to him!\"    Napoleon goes to Saint Helena and dies in 1821. What he did for  Germany was to prove to her how impossible was a cluster of jealous,  malicious provincial little state governments in the heart of Europe,  protecting themselves from falling apart by the ancient legislative  scaffolding of the Holy Roman Empire. He squeezed three hundred states  into thirty-eight, and the very year of Waterloo, on April the 1st, a  German Napoleon was born who was to further squeeze these states into  what is known to-day as the German Empire.    The Congress of Vienna was a meeting of the European powers to  redistribute the possessions, that Napoleon had scattered as bribes  and rewards among his friends, relatives, and enemies, so far as  possible, among their rightful owners.    From the island of Elba, off the coast of Tuscany, Napoleon looked on  while the allies quarrelled at this Congress of Vienna. Prussia  claimed the right to annex Saxony; Russia demanded Poland, and against  them were leagued England, Austria, and France, France represented by  the Mephistophelian Talleyrand, who strove merely to stir the discord  into another war. In the midst of their deliberations word came that  the wolf was in the fold again. Napoleon was riding to Paris, through  hysterical crowds of French men and women, eager for another throw  against the world, if their Little Corporal were there to shake the  dice for them. He had another throw and lost. The French Revolution"]]]
