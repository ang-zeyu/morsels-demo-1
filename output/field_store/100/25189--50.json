Well, you may  have your permit on condition that you promise to talk no politics and  to be in your own homes before 7 p.m.\"    Hansie gave the promise on behalf of the vocal society, and yet  another war-permit was added to her curious collection! With all the  friendliness existing between the Governor and herself, I do not for a  moment think that they ever trusted one another completely. Were they  not both good patriots? Hansie knew by the questions he asked her that  he was trying to extract information from her, and the Governor only  told her as much as he thought she could use to his own advantage.    On this particular occasion, when he parted from her, he asked in a  fatherly, I-take-such-an-interest-in-you way whether she ever heard  from her brothers.    \"No,\" she exclaimed in innocent surprise. \"How can I?\" (and at the  time she spoke truth). Whereupon he sympathetically murmured something  about \"a very trying time for you.\"    Permits everywhere and for everything!    Men were stopped in the streets to show their residential passes,  private carriages were held up and the occupants requested to produce  their permits for vehicle and horses, and cyclists had to dismount a  dozen times a day at the sign of some khaki-clothed figure patrolling  the streets.    The first British officers to cross Harmony's threshold as visitors  and equals were a colonel and a young captain, who both came from  Wynberg with letters of introduction from Mrs. van Warmelo's daughter,  Mrs. Henry Cloete.    After the long months of irregular correspondence, always severely  censored, it was such a relief to get news direct that the bearers  were welcomed gratefully.    They called again, and the dignified presence of the Colonel soon  became a familiar sight at Harmony. With him it was quite possible to  converse, for he avoided every painful topic with the utmost tact and  good-breeding, but the Captain was a veritable firebrand, and many  were the heated arguments carried on during his visits.    As the weary, weary months dragged on, and the most sanguine could not  see the end of the terrible war, it seemed as if feeling grew stronger  and the power of endurance lessened.    Even the occasional visits of the British officers became trying to  the van Warmelos, and one day her mother asked Hansie to request the  Captain not to come again, valiantly retreating to the garden when  next he called, and leaving her daughter to fight it out with him  alone.    \"I am very sorry,\" he said, \"but what have _I_ done?\"    \"Nothing,\" Hansie answered, \"but you see it is against our principles,  and we would like you to wait until the war is over----\" The hateful  task was over, and the Captain took his departure, not to return  again.    Hansie refused obstinately to go over the same ground with the  Colonel. He came so seldom, and he was such a kind and courteous old  gentleman, that it seemed unnecessary to put an end to his visits, and  in time his own good feeling told him to discontinue them.    It was in the summer of 1901, when the days at Harmony were spent in  the fruit-laden garden and great jars of apples, pears, peaches, and  figs were being canned and preserved for winter use, that thoughts  strayed most lovingly and persistently to the two hungry brothers in  the field.    \"Where are they, I wonder?\" was a frequent exclamation. \"Did they ever  reach the Boer commandos, and oh, when shall we hear from them?\"    Great were the rejoicings when Dr. Mulder, who was on his way to  Holland, and had got permission from the British to pass through  Pretoria from the Boer lines, arrived at Harmony with the news that he  had seen the two van Warmelos in the English camp at Nooitgedacht,  after its capture by the Boers under General Beyers. They were well  and in good spirits then, and the delight their mother and sister  experienced at seeing some one direct from the Boer lines can only be  appreciated by those who know what it means to a Boer to be a captive  under British martial law.    At this time Pretoria was almost completely surrounded by the Boers,  and every precaution was being taken against a possible attack. Deep  trenches were dug all round the town, electric wires put up, while the  hills bristled with cannon and searchlights played from the forts  incessantly at night.    The realities of war were forced upon one by the increased activity on  the Eastern Railway line to Delagoa Bay, plainly visible from the side  verandah at Harmony, and, daily, train loads passed of armed soldiers,  or Boer women and children being brought in from the devastated farms.    Armoured trains and Red Cross carriages steamed in and out, horses,  cattle, provision loads--everything that could remind one of the  fierce strife raging throughout the land.    At this time it became evident that a thief or thieves were helping  themselves at night to thoroughbred fowls and fruit at Harmony, and  Mrs. van Warmelo asked the sergeant-major of the Military Mounted  Police to consult with her about catching the miscreants.    She suspected Kaffirs--certainly not the troops encamped about the  place, for a more orderly set of soldiers it would have been hard to  find. Their behaviour was always so exemplary that they were now and  then rewarded with baskets of fruit and vegetables from Harmony's  overflowing abundance.    It was therefore perfectly natural that the sergeant-major should  hurry over to the house, indignant and sympathetic, to listen to Mrs.  van Warmelo's grievances and to lay plans for the capture of the  cunning thief.    That he came at dawn seemed evident, for though the police watched  every night, they never caught sight of him, and yet there were fowls  missing every morning. Things were beginning to look rather suspicious  when, in spite of the vigilant watch kept by the police, there were  only nineteen fowls left of the sixty. Mrs. van Warmelo made up her  mind to watch for herself.    Early next morning, when a fine white cock had disappeared, she set  out with one of the native servants, and, following the track made by  the white feathers the bird had lost in its struggles, she came upon  the thieves' den. An ideal spot in a little hollow by the riverside,  surrounded by trees and shrubs! A small fireplace, a few old sacks and  tins and a mass of feathers and bones told their own tale, and Mrs.  van Warmelo went home well satisfied.    The sergeant-major, when he heard her story, said he thought it would  be better to catch the thief red-handed in the fowl-run than to  surprise him in his den, and the police were set to watch again that  night.    In the morning two fine hens were missing! The remarks then made at  Harmony on the vigilance of British soldiers in general and Military  Mounted Police in particular were complimentary in the extreme.    Then Mrs. van Warmelo sent the boy to reconnoitre, and he soon came  running back in great excitement, with the news that the thief, a  young Kaffir, was sitting beside a fire, eating fowls.    Armed to the teeth, the police set forth to capture him, and soon  returned with the miscreant. Such a sight he was! Glistening with fat  and covered with feathers, and, as one of the soldiers remarked,  \"with a corporation like the Lord Mayor.\" He was handcuffed and taken  to the police camp, while the men had their breakfast before escorting  him to the Charge Office.    Suddenly there was a fearful commotion.    The culprit had slipped off one of his handcuffs, crept through the  wire fence unobserved, and was flying like the wind through the garden  towards the river.    After him, in wild confusion, jumping over shrubs and furrows,  followed half a dozen soldiers, a couple of natives, Carlo, and I  don't know how many other dogs.    He was captured by the brave corporal as he was dashing up the bank on  the other side of the river, and brought back to the camp, with his  hands tied securely behind.    One month's imprisonment only and a change of diet were prescribed for  him at the Charge Office that day.    This incident, though exciting at the time, would not have been worth  recording here were it not for its connection with what happened  afterwards.    Whatever suspicions the military may have had of intrigues at Harmony,  these must have been removed by the fact of their having been  requested by the inmates themselves to keep a watch over the property.    So the way was being unconsciously prepared for subsequent events.    As fruit was also being stolen from time to time, the soldiers  maintained their watch over the garden, well knowing that their  vigilance would be rewarded by a full share of the good things, while  they would be the losers if the pilfering were allowed to continue.    When it became evident, a few months later, that another thief was  helping himself to her fowls, Mrs. van Warmelo made up her mind to  catch him red-handed, without the assistance of the Military Police.    She decided that he would not come back at once, and gave him two days  to digest his spoil, and on the third day she got up very early in the  hopes of being on the scenes before him, ready to receive him when he  came.    She had only been in the garden a few moments when she saw some one,  in a stooping posture, running swiftly towards the fowl-run. A moment  later and he had seen her. He turned and ran in the opposite  direction, Mrs. van Warmelo following closely on his heels, loading  her revolver as she ran and calling out, \"Stand, or I fire.\" On being  warned a second time he stopped and turned round. Mrs. van Warmelo  demanded what he was doing on her property, and he answered in good  English that he had lost his way, upon which Mrs. van Warmelo offered  to show him the way, and ordered him to march on ahead. With the  loaded revolver between his shoulders, the culprit was forced to obey,  and Mrs. van"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#9)"],[1,"come first for the sake of  keeping the later blocks in proper register. If the key-block is not  printed one cannot see how the colour-blocks are fitting. But in the  case of a sky with perhaps two or even three printings--a gradation and  a flat tone or two gradations--there is danger of blurring the lines of  the key-block, so that in such a case the sky should be printed first,  and then the key-block followed by the remaining colour-blocks.    At the end of a day's printing the prints may quite safely be left  standing together between the boards until the next day. For three days  the damp paper comes to no harm, except in hot weather, but on the  fourth day little red spots of mould begin to show and spread. It should  be remembered that freshly boiled paste is to be used each day.      DRYING OF PRINTS    When the prints are finished they should be put to dry as soon as  possible. If they are spread out and left exposed to the air they will  soon dry, but in drying will cockle, and cannot then be easily pressed  flat. It is better to have a number of mill-boards or absorbent \"pulp\"  boards rather larger than the prints, and to pile the prints and boards  alternately one by one, placing a weight on the top of the pile. The  absorbent boards will rapidly dry the prints and keep them quite flat.    Finished prints should be numbered for reference, and should, if printed  by the artist himself, also bear his signature --or some printed sign  to that effect. The number of prints obtainable from a set of blocks is  difficult to estimate. The Japanese printers are said to have made  editions of several thousands from single sets of blocks. The actual  wear in printing even of a fine line block is imperceptible, for the  pressure is very slight. Certainly hundreds of prints can be made  without any deterioration. But an artist who is both designing and  producing his own work will not be inclined to print large editions.[5]    [5] Further experience on this point is given in Chapter VIII on  Co-operative Printing.          CHAPTER VII           Principles and Main Considerations in designing Wood-block       Prints--Their Application to Modern Colour Printing    Until one has become quite familiar with the craft of wood-block  printing it is not possible to make a satisfactory design for a print,  or to understand either the full resources that are available or the  limits that are fixed.    In beginning it is well to undertake only a small design, so that no  great amount of material or time need be consumed in gaining the first  experience, but this small piece of work should be carried through to  the end, however defective it may become at any stage. A small key-block  and two or three colour patches may all be cut on the two sides of one  plank for this purpose.    There is great diversity of opinion as to the conventions that are  appropriate to the designing of colour prints. In the work of the  Japanese masters the convention does not vary. A descriptive black or  grey line is used throughout the design, outlining all forms or used as  flat spots or patches. The line is not always uniform, but is developed  with great subtlety to suggest the character of the form expressed, so  that the subsequent flat mass of colour printed within the line appears  to be modelled. This treatment of the line is one of the great resources  of the work, and is special to this kind of design, in which the line  has to be cut with the knife _on both sides_, and is for this reason  capable of unusual development in its power of expressing form. Indeed  the knife is the final instrument in the drawing of the design.    Typical examples of key-block impressions are given on pages 26 and 33:  they show the variety of character and quality possible in the lines and  black masses of key-blocks.    The designing of a print depends most of all upon this development of  line and black mass in the key-block. The colour pattern of the print is  held together by it, and the form suggested. In the Japanese prints the  key-block is invariably printed black or grey. Masses intended to be  dense black in the finished print are printed first a flat grey by the  key-block, and are then printed a full black from a colour-block like  any other patch of colour, the double printing being necessary to give  the intensity of the black.    Although several modern prints have been designed on other principles,  and sometimes a coloured key-block is successfully used, yet the  convention adopted by the Japanese is the simplest and most fundamental  of all. Outside its safe limitations the technical difficulties are  increased, and one is led to make compromises that strain the proper  resources of block printing and are of doubtful advantage.    The temptation to use colour with the key-block comes when one attempts  to use the key-block for rendering light and shadow. Its use by the  Japanese masters was generally for the descriptive expression of the  contours of objects, ignoring entirely their shadows, or any effects of  light and shade, unless a shadow happened occasionally to be an  important part of the pattern of the design. Generally, as in nearly all  the landscape prints by Hiroshige, the line is descriptive or suggestive  of essential form, not of effects in light and shade.    If the key-block is used for light and shade, the question of relative  tones and values of shadows arises, and these will be falsified unless a  key-block is made for each separate plane or part of the design, and  then there is danger of confusion or of compromises that are beyond the  true scope of the work.    It is generally safest to print the key-block in a tone that blends with  the general tone of the print, and not to use it as a part of the  colour pattern. It serves mainly to control the form, leaving the  colour-blocks to give the colour pattern. There are cases, of course,  where no rule holds good, and sometimes a design may successfully omit  the key-block altogether, using only a few silhouettes of colour, one of  which controls the main form of the print, and serves as key-block.  Frequently, also, the key-block may be used to give the interior form or  character of part of a design, leaving the shape of a colour-block to  express the outside shape or contour; as in the spots suggesting foliage  in the print on page 114. The shapes of the tree forms are partly left  to the colour-block to complete, the key only giving the suggestion of  the general broken character of the foliage, not the outside limits of  the branches. The outer shape of a tree or branch is rarely expressed by  an enclosing line in any of the Japanese prints. The key-block is often  used to describe interior form when a silhouette of colour is all that  is needed for the contour. The expressive rendering of the rough surface  of tree trunks and of forms of rock, or the articulation of plants and  the suggestion of objects in atmospheric distance or mist, should be  studied in good prints by the Japanese masters. In printed work by  modern masters--as, for example, the work of the great French designers  of poster advertisements--much may be learnt in the use and development  of expressive line.    The Japanese system of training is well described in a book by Henry P.  Bowie on \"The Laws of Japanese Painting,\" in which many useful  suggestions are given with reference to graphic brush drawing and the  suggestive use of line and brush marks.    As part of the training of a designer for modern decorative printing,  the experience and sense of economy that are to be gained from the study  of wood-block printing are very great. Perhaps no work goes so directly  to the essentials of the art of decorative designing for printed work  of all kinds. The wood blocks not only compel economy of design, but  also lead one to it.    Even as a means of general training in the elements of decorative  pictorial composition the wood blocks have great possibilities as an  adjunct to the courses of work followed by art students. The same  problems that arise in all decoration may be dealt with by their means  on a small scale, but under conditions that are essentially instructive.  Colour schemes may be studied and worked out with entire freedom by  printing and reprinting until a problem is thoroughly solved. A colour  design may be studied and worked out as fully by means of a small set of  blocks, and with more freedom for experiment and alteration than is  possible by the usual methods of study, such as painting and repainting  on paper or canvas or wall; for the form being once established by the  blocks, the colour may be reconstructed again and again without limit.    The craft has thus not only its special interest as a means of personal  expression, but also a more general use as a means of training and  preparation for the wider scope and almost unlimited resources of modern  printing. The best use of those resources will be made by artists who  have been trained under simpler conditions, and have found their way  gradually to an understanding of the secrets of aesthetic economy in  printing. One of the many paths to that experience is by way of the  craft of the wood-block printer.          CHAPTER VIII           Co-operative Printing    A print is shown at the end of this book (page 95) as an example of a  first experiment in co-operative printing. An actual print was needed to  illustrate the method of block printing, and the number required was too  great for a single printer to undertake. So the work was divided between  four printers (of whom the writer was one), working together. Each of us  had been accustomed to print our own prints in small batches of a dozen  or two at a time, giving individual care to each print. The printing of  2000 prints to a fixed type was a very different matter, and proved an  instructive and valuable experience. It was found that the printing of "]]]
