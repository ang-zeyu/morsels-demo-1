Well I perceived that he was  sent from Heaven, and I turned me to the Master, and he made sign  that I should stand quiet and bow down unto him. Ah, how full of  disdain he seemed to me! He reached the gate and with a little  rod he opened it, for there was no withstanding.    \"O outcasts from Heaven, folk despised,\" began he upon the  horrible threshold, \"wherefore is this overweening harbored in  you? Why do ye kick against that will from which its end can  never be cut short, and which many a time hath increased your  grief? What avails it to butt against the fates? Your Cerberus,  if ye remember well, still bears his chin and his throat peeled  for that.\" Then he turned back upon the filthy road and said no  word to us, but wore the semblance of a man whom other care  constrains and stings, than that of him who is before him.    And we moved our feet toward the city, confident after his holy  words. Within we entered without any strife, and I, who had  desire to observe the condition which such a stronghold locks in,  when I was within, sent my eyes round about; and I see on every  hand a great plain full of woe and of cruel torment.    As at Arles, where the Rhone stagnates, as at Pola, near the  Quarnaro that shuts in Italy and bathes its borders, sepulchres  make all the place uneven; so did they here on every side, saving  that the manner was more bitter here; for among the tombs flames  were scattered, by which they were so intensely kindled that no  art requires iron more so. All their lids were lifted; and such  dire laments were issuing forth from them as truly seemed of  wretches and of sufferers.    And I, \"Master, who are these folk that, buried within those  coffers, make themselves heard with their woeful sighs?\" And he  to me, \"Here are the heresiarchs with their followers of every  sect, and the tombs are much more laden than thou thinkest. Like  with like is buried here, and the monuments are more and less  hot.\"    And when he to the right hand had turned, we passed between the  torments and the high battlements.        CANTO X. The Sixth Circle: Heresiarchs.--Farinata degli  Uberti.-Cavalcante Cavalcanti.--Frederick II.    Now along a narrow path between the wall of the city and the  torments my Master goeth on, and I behind his shoulders.    \"O Virtue supreme,\" I began, \"that through the impious circles  turnest me, according to thy pleasure, speak to me and satisfy my  desires. The folk that are lying in the sepulchres, can they be  seen? All the lids are now lifted, and no one keepeth guard.\" And  he to me, \"All shall be locked in when from Jehoshaphat they  shall here return with the bodies which they have left on earth.  Upon this side Epicurus with all his followers, who make the soul  mortal with the body, have their burial place. Therefore as to  the demand that thou makest of me, thou shalt soon be satisfied  here within; and also as to the desire concerning which thou art  silent to me.\" And I, \"Good Leader, I hold not my heart hidden  from thee except in order to speak little; and not only now to  that hast thou disposed me.\"    \"O Tuscan, who through the city of fire alive art going, speaking  thus modestly, may it please thee to stop in this place. Thy  speech makes manifest that thou art native of that noble  fatherland to which perchance I was too molestful.\" Suddenly this  sound issued from one of the coffers, wherefore I drew, in fear,  a little nearer to my Leader. And he said to me, \"Turn, what dost  thou? Behold Farinata who hath uprisen; thou shalt see him all  from the girdle up.\"    I had already fixed my face on his, and he straightened himself  up with breast and front as though he had Hell in great scorn.  And the bold and ready hands of my Leader pushed me among the  sepulchres to him, saying, \"Let thy words be choice.\"    When I was at the foot of his tomb, he looked at me a little, and  then, as though disdainful, asked me, \"Who were thy ancestors?\"  I, who was desirous to obey, concealed them not, but disclosed  them all to him; whereon he raised his brows a little up, then  said, \"Fiercely were they adverse to me, and to my fathers, and  to my party, so that twice I scattered them.\" [1] \"If they were  driven out, they returned from every side,\" replied I to him,  \"both one and the other time, but yours have not learned well  that art.\"    [1] Dante's ancestors were Guelphs.      Then there arose, to view uncovered down to the chin, a shade at  the side of this one; I think that it had risen on its knees.  Round about me it looked, as if it had desire to see if another  were with me, but when its expectancy was quite extinct, weeping  it said, \"If through this blind dungeon thou goest through  loftiness of genius, my son, where is he? and why is he not with  thee?\" And I to him, \"Of myself I come not; he who waits yonder  leads me through here, whom perchance your Guido held in  scorn.\"[1]    [1] Guido Cavalcanti was charged with the same sin of unbelief as  his father. Dante regards this as a sin specially contrary to  right reason, typified by Virgil.      His words and the mode of the punishment had already read to me  the name of this one, wherefore my answer was so full.    Suddenly straightening up, he cried, \"How didst thou say, 'he  held'? lives he not still? doth not the sweet light strike his  eyes?\" When he took note of some delay that I made before  answering, he fell again supine, and forth appeared no more.    But that other magnanimous one, at whose instance I had stayed,  changed not aspect, nor moved his neck, nor bent his side. \"And  if,\" he said, continuing his first words, \"they have ill learned  that art, it torments me more than this bed. But the face of the  lady who ruleth here will not be rekindled fifty times ere thou  shalt know how much that art weighs. And, so mayest thou return  unto the sweet world, tell me wherefore is that people so  pitiless against my race in its every law?\" Then I to him, \"The  rout and the great carnage that colored the Arbia red cause such  orison to be made in our temple.\" After he had, sighing, shaken  his head, \"In that I was not alone,\" he said, \"nor surely without  cause would I have moved with the rest; but I was alone,--there  [1] where it was agreed by every one to lay Florence waste,--he  who defended her with open face.\" \"Ah! so hereafter may your seed  repose,\" I prayed to him, \"loose for me that knot, which here has  entangled my judgment. It seems, if I rightly hear, that ye  foresee that which time is bringing with him, and as to the  present have another way.\" \"We see,\" he said, \"like those who  have feeble light, the things that are far from us, so much still  shineth on us the supreme Leader; when they draw near, or are,  our intelligence is all vain, and, if some one report not to us,  we know nothing of your human state. Therefore thou canst  comprehend that our knowledge will be utterly dead from that  moment when the gate of the future shall he closed.\" Then, as  compunctious for my fault I said, \"Now wilt thou therefore tell  that fallen one that his son is still conjoined with the living,  and if just now I was dumb to answer, make him know that I was so  because I was still thinking in that error which you have solved  for me.\" [2]    [1] At Empoli, in 1260, after the defeat of the Florentine  Guelphs at Montaperti on the Arbia.    [2] Guido Cavalcanti died in August, 1300; his death, being near  at hand at the time of Dante's journey, was not known to his  father.      And now my Master was calling me back, wherefore I prayed the  spirit more hastily that he would tell me who was with him. He  said to me, \"Here with more than a thousand do I lie; here within  is the second Frederick and the Cardinal,[1] and of the others I  am silent.\"    [1] Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, a fierce Ghibelline, who was  reported as saying, \"If there be a soul I have lost it for the  Ghibellines.\"      Thereon he hid himself; and I toward the ancient Poet turned my  steps, reflecting on that speech which seemed hostile to me. He  moved on, and then, thus going, he said to me, \"Why art thou so  distraught?\" And I satisfied his demand. \"Let thy memory preserve  that which thou hast heard against thyself,\" commanded me that  Sage, \"and now attend to this,\" and he raised his finger. \"When  thou shalt be in presence of the sweet radiance of her whose  beautiful eye sees everything, from her thou shalt learn the  journey of thy life.\" Then to the left he turned his step.    We left the wall, and went toward the middle by a path which  strikes into a valley that even up there its stench made  displeasing.        CANTO XI. The Sixth Circle: Heretics.--Tomb of Pope Anastasins.--  Discourse of Virgil on the divisions of the lower Hell.    Upon the edge of a high bank formed by great rocks broken in a  circle, we came above a more cruel pen. And here, because of the  horrible excess of the stench that the deep abyss throws out, we  drew aside behind the lid of a great tomb, whereon I saw an  inscription which said, \"Pope Anastasius I hold, he whom Photinus  drew from the right way.\"    \"Our descent must needs be slow so that the sense may first  accustom itself a little to the dismal blast, and then will be no  heed of it.\" Thus the Master, and I said to him, \"Some  compensation do thou find that the time pass not lost.\" And be,  \"Behold, I am thinking of that. My son, within these rocks,\" he  began to say, \"are three circlets from grade to grade like those  thou leavest. All are full of accursed spirits; but, in order  that hereafter sight only may suffice thee, hear how and  wherefore they are in constraint.    \"Of every malice that wins hate in heaven injury is the end, and  every such end afflicts others either by force or by fraud. But  because fraud is the peculiar sin of man, it most displeaseth  God; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#9)"],[1,"  of the Word of God; thirdly, \"by operation,\" inasmuch as they said  the man was the instrument of the Word of God; fourthly, \"by  greatness of honor,\" inasmuch as all honor shown to the Son of God  was equally shown to the Son of man, on account of His union with the  Son of God; fifthly, \"by equivocation,\" i.e. communication of names,  inasmuch as we say that this man is God and the Son of God. Now it is  plain that these modes imply an accidental union.    But some more recent masters, thinking to avoid these heresies,  through ignorance fell into them. For some conceded one person in  Christ, but maintained two hypostases, or two supposita, saying that  a man, composed of body and soul, was from the beginning of his  conception assumed by the Word of God. And this is the first opinion  set down by the Master (Sent. iii, D, 6). But others desirous of  keeping the unity of person, held that the soul of Christ was not  united to the body, but that these two were mutually separate, and  were united to the Word accidentally, so that the number of persons  might not be increased. And this is the third opinion which the  Master sets down (Sent. iii, D, 6).    But both of these opinions fall into the heresy of Nestorius; the  first, indeed, because to maintain two hypostases or supposita in  Christ is the same as to maintain two persons, as was shown above (A.  3). And if stress is laid on the word \"person,\" we must have in mind  that even Nestorius spoke of unity of person on account of the unity  of dignity and honor. Hence the fifth Council (Constantinople II,  coll. viii, can. 5) directs an anathema against such a one as holds  \"one person in dignity, honor and adoration, as Theodore and  Nestorius foolishly wrote.\" But the other opinion falls into the  error of Nestorius by maintaining an accidental union. For there is  no difference in saying that the Word of God is united to the Man  Christ by indwelling, as in His temple (as Nestorius said), or by  putting on man, as a garment, which is the third opinion; rather it  says something worse than Nestorius--to wit, that the soul and body  are not united.    Now the Catholic faith, holding the mean between the aforesaid  positions, does not affirm that the union of God and man took place  in the essence or nature, nor yet in something accidental, but  midway, in a subsistence or hypostasis. Hence in the fifth Council  (Constantinople II, coll. viii, can. 5) we read: \"Since the unity may  be understood in many ways, those who follow the impiety of  Apollinaris and Eutyches, professing the destruction of what came  together\" (i.e. destroying both natures), \"confess a union by  mingling; but the followers of Theodore and Nestorius, maintaining  division, introduce a union of purpose. But the Holy Church of God,  rejecting the impiety of both these treasons, confesses a union of  the Word of God with flesh, by composition, which is in subsistence.\"  Therefore it is plain that the second of the three opinions,  mentioned by the Master (Sent. iii, D, 6), which holds one hypostasis  of God and man, is not to be called an opinion, but an article of  Catholic faith. So likewise the first opinion which holds two  hypostases, and the third which holds an accidental union, are not to  be styled opinions, but heresies condemned by the Church in Councils.    Reply Obj. 1: As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 26): \"Examples  need not be wholly and at all points similar, for what is wholly  similar is the same, and not an example, and especially in Divine  things, for it is impossible to find a wholly similar example in the  Theology,\" i.e. in the Godhead of Persons, \"and in the Dispensation,\"  i.e. the mystery of the Incarnation. Hence the human nature in Christ  is likened to a habit, i.e. a garment, not indeed in regard to  accidental union, but inasmuch as the Word is seen by the human  nature, as a man by his garment, and also inasmuch as the garment is  changed, for it is shaped according to the figure of him who puts it  on, and yet he is not changed from his form on account of the  garment. So likewise the human nature assumed by the Word of God is  ennobled, but the Word of God is not changed, as Augustine says (Qq.  83, qu. 73).    Reply Obj. 2: Whatever accrues after the completion of the being  comes accidentally, unless it be taken into communion with the  complete being, just as in the resurrection the body comes to the  soul which pre-exists, yet not accidentally, because it is assumed  unto the same being, so that the body has vital being through the  soul; but it is not so with whiteness, for the being of whiteness is  other than the being of man to which whiteness comes. But the Word of  God from all eternity had complete being in hypostasis or person;  while in time the human nature accrued to it, not as if it were  assumed unto one being inasmuch as this is of the nature (even as the  body is assumed to the being of the soul), but to one being inasmuch  as this is of the hypostasis or person. Hence the human nature is not  accidentally united to the Son of God.    Reply Obj. 3: Accident is divided against substance. Now substance,  as is plain from _Metaph._ v, 25, is taken in two ways: first, for  essence or nature; secondly, for suppositum or hypostasis--hence the  union having taken place in the hypostasis, is enough to show that it  is not an accidental union, although the union did not take place in  the nature.    Reply Obj. 4: Not everything that is assumed as an instrument  pertains to the hypostasis of the one who assumes, as is plain in the  case of a saw or a sword; yet nothing prevents what is assumed into  the unity of the hypostasis from being as an instrument, even as the  body of man or his members. Hence Nestorius held that the human  nature was assumed by the Word merely as an instrument, and not into  the unity of the hypostasis. And therefore he did not concede that  the man was really the Son of God, but His instrument. Hence Cyril  says (Epist. ad Monach. Aegyptii): \"The Scripture does not affirm  that this Emmanuel,\" i.e. Christ, \"was assumed for the office of an  instrument, but as God truly humanized,\" i.e. made man. But Damascene  held that the human nature in Christ is an instrument belonging to  the unity of the hypostasis.  _______________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 7]    Whether the Union of the Divine Nature and the Human Is Anything  Created?    Objection 1: It would seem that the union of the Divine and human  natures is not anything created. For there can be nothing created in  God, because whatever is in God is God. But the union is in God, for  God Himself is united to human nature. Therefore it seems that the  union is not anything created.    Obj. 2: Further, the end holds first place in everything. But the end  of the union is the Divine hypostasis or Person in which the union is  terminated. Therefore it seems that this union ought chiefly to be  judged with reference to the dignity of the Divine hypostasis, which  is not anything created. Therefore the union is nothing created.    Obj. 3: Further, \"That which is the cause of a thing being such is  still more so\" (Poster. i). But man is said to be the Creator on  account of the union. Therefore much more is the union itself nothing  created, but the Creator.    _On the contrary,_ Whatever has a beginning in time is created. Now  this union was not from eternity, but began in time. Therefore the  union is something created.    _I answer that,_ The union of which we are speaking is a relation  which we consider between the Divine and the human nature, inasmuch  as they come together in one Person of the Son of God. Now, as was  said above (I, Q. 13, A. 7), every relation which we consider between  God and the creature is really in the creature, by whose change the  relation is brought into being; whereas it is not really in God, but  only in our way of thinking, since it does not arise from any change  in God. And hence we must say that the union of which we are speaking  is not really in God, except only in our way of thinking; but in the  human nature, which is a creature, it is really. Therefore we must  say it is something created.    Reply Obj. 1: This union is not really in God, but only in our way of  thinking, for God is said to be united to a creature inasmuch as the  creature is really united to God without any change in Him.    Reply Obj. 2: The specific nature of a relation, as of motion,  depends on the subject. And since this union has its being nowhere  save in a created nature, as was said above, it follows that it has a  created being.    Reply Obj. 3: A man is called Creator and is God because of the  union, inasmuch as it is terminated in the Divine hypostasis; yet it  does not follow that the union itself is the Creator or God, because  that a thing is said to be created regards its being rather than its  relation.  _______________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 2, Art. 8]    Whether Union Is the Same As Assumption?    Objection 1: It would seem that union is the same as assumption. For  relations, as motions, are specified by their termini. Now the term  of assumption and union is one and the same, viz. the Divine  hypostasis. Therefore it seems that union and assumption are not  different.    Obj. 2: Further, in the mystery of the Incarnation the same thing  seems to be what unites and what assumes, and what is united and what  is assumed. But union and assumption seem to follow the action and  passion of the thing uniting and the united, of the thing assuming  and the assumed. Therefore union seems to be the same as assumption.    Obj. 3: Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11): \"Union is  one thing, incarnation is another; for union demands mere copulation,  and leaves unsaid the end of the copulation; but incarnation and  humanation determine the end of copulation.\" But likewise assumption  does not determine the"]]]
