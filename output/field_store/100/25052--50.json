[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#9)"],[1,"  On Sunday, September 27, we woke to hear cannon booming and the house  shaking with each concussion. The Germans had begun bombarding the forts  which lay between Brussels and Antwerp. Looking from the heights of  Brussels with a good glass, one could see shells bursting near Waelheim  and Wavre St. Catherine. The Belgians were absolutely convinced that  Antwerp was impregnable, and as we had heard that large masses of  English troops had been landed there, we hoped very much that this would  be the turning-point of the war, and that the Germans might be driven  back out of the country.    On Wednesday, September 30, the sounds of cannon grew more distant, and  we heard that Wavre St. Catherine had been taken. The Belgians were  still confident, but it seems certain that the Germans were convinced  that nothing could withstand their big guns, for they made every  preparation to settle down in Brussels for the winter. They announced  that from October 1 Brussels would be considered as part of German  territory, and that they intended to re-establish the local postal  service from that date. They reckoned without their host there, for the  Brussels postmen refused to a man to take service under them, so the  arrangement collapsed. They did re-establish postal communication  between Brussels and Germany, and issued a special set of four stamps.  They were the ordinary German stamps of 3, 5, 10 and 20 pfennig, and  were surcharged in black \"Belgien 3, 5, 10 and 20 centimes.\"    About this time, too, they took M. Max, the Burgomaster, off to Liege as  prisoner, on the pretext that Brussels had not yet paid the enormous  indemnity demanded of it. He held the people in the hollow of his hand,  and the Brussels authorities very much feared a rising when he was taken  off. But the Echevins, or College of Sheriffs, rose to the occasion,  divided his work between them, and formed a local police composed of  some of the most notable citizens of the town. They were on duty all day  and night and divided the work into four-hour shifts, and did splendid  work in warning the people against disorderly acts and preventing  disturbances. It is not difficult to guess what would have happened if  these patriotic citizens had not acted in this way--there would most  certainly have been a rising among the people, and the German reprisals  would have been terrible. As it was a German soldier who was swaggering  alone down the Rue Basse was torn in pieces by the angry crowd, but for  some reason this outbreak was hushed up by the German authorities.          V    A MEMORABLE JOURNEY      The authorities seemed to be far too busy to trouble themselves about  our affairs, and we could get no news as to what was going to happen to  us. There was a good deal of typhoid fever in Brussels, and I thought I  would employ this waiting time in getting inoculated against it, as I  had not had time to do so before leaving England.    This operation was performed every Saturday by a doctor at the Hopital  St. Pierre, so on Saturday, October 3, I repaired there to take my turn  with the others. The prick was nothing, and it never occurred to me that  I should take badly, having had, I believe, typhoid when a child. But I  soon began to feel waves of hot and cold, then a violent headache came  on, and I was forced to go to bed with a very painful arm and a high  temperature. I tossed about all night, and the next morning I was worse  rather than better. At midday I received a message that every English  Sister and doctor in Brussels was to leave for England the next day, via  Holland, in a special train that had been chartered by some Americans  and accompanied by the American Consul. How I rejoiced at my fever, for  now I had a legitimate excuse for staying behind, for except at the  point of the sword I did not mean to leave Belgium while I still had  nurses there who might be in danger. The heads of all the various  parties were requested to let their nurses know that they must be at the  station the next day at 2 P. M. Several of my nurses were  lodging in the house I was in, and I sent a message to them and to all  the others that they must be ready at the appointed place and time. I  also let a trusted few know that I did not mean to go myself, and gave  them letters and messages for England.    The next morning I was still not able to get up, but several of my  people came in to say good-bye to me in bed, and I wished them good luck  and a safe passage back to England. By 1 P. M. they were all  gone, and a great peace fell over the house. I struggled out of bed,  put all traces of uniform away, and got out my civilian dress. I was no  longer an official, but a private person out in Belgium on my own  account, and intended to walk to Charleroi by short stages as soon as I  was able. I returned to bed, and at five o'clock I was half asleep, half  picturing my flock on their way to England, when there was a great  clamour and clatter, and half a dozen of them burst into my room. They  were all back once more!    They told me they had gone down to the station as they were told, and  found the special train for Americans going off to the Dutch frontier.  Their names were all read out, but they were not allowed to get into the  train, and were told they were not going that day after all. The German  officials present would give no reason for the change, and were  extremely rude to the nurses. They told me my name had been read out  amongst the others. They had been asked why I was not there, and had  replied that I was ill in bed.    Just then a letter arrived marked \"Urgent,\" and in it was an order that  I should be at the station at 12 P. M. the next day _without  fail_, accompanied by my nurses. I was very sad that they had discovered  I did not want to go, because I knew now that they would leave no stone  unturned to make me, but I determined to resist to the last moment and  not go if I could help it. So I sent back a message to the Head Doctor  of the Red Cross unit, asking him to convey to the German authorities  the fact that I was ill in bed and could not travel the next day. Back  came a message to say that they regretted to hear I was ill, and that I  should be transferred at once to a German hospital and be attended by a  German doctor. That, of course, was no good at all--I should then  probably have been a German prisoner till the end of the war, and not  have been the slightest use to anyone.    I very reluctantly gave in and said I would go. We were told that we  should be safely conducted as far as the Dutch frontier, and so I  determined to get across to Antwerp if I could from there and work my  way back to Brussels in private clothes.    I scrambled up somehow the next day, and found a very large party  assembled outside the Gare du Nord, as every single English nurse and  doctor in Brussels was to be expelled. There must have been fifteen or  twenty doctors and dressers altogether, and more than a hundred Sisters  and nurses.    A squad of German soldiers were lined up outside the station, and two  officers guarded the entrance. They had a list of our names, and as each  name was read out, we were passed into the station, where a long, black  troop-train composed of third-class carriages was waiting for us. The  front wagons were, I believe, full of either wounded or prisoners, as  only a few carriages were reserved for us. However, we crowded in, eight  of us in a carriage meant for six, and found, greatly to our surprise,  that there were two soldiers with loaded rifles sitting at the window in  each compartment. There was nothing to be said, we were entirely in  their hands, and after all the Dutch frontier was not so very far off.    The soldiers had had orders to sit at the two windows and prevent us  seeing out, but our two guards were exceedingly nice men, not Prussians  but Danish Germans from Schleswig-Holstein, who did not at all enjoy the  job they had been put to, so our windows were not shut nor our blinds  down as those in some of the other carriages were.    A whistle sounded, and we were off. We went very very slowly, and waited  an interminable time at each station. When evening came on we had only  arrived as far as Louvain, and were interested to see two Zeppelins  looming clear and black against the sunset sky, in the Malines direction  flying towards Antwerp. It was not too dark to see the fearful  destruction that had been dealt out to this famous Catholic University,  only built and endowed during the last eighty years by great and heroic  sacrifices on the part of both clergy and people. The two German  soldiers in our carriage were themselves ashamed when they saw from the  window the crumbling ruins and burnt-out buildings which are all that  remain of Louvain now. One of them muttered: \"If only the people had not  fired at the soldiers, this would never have happened.\" Since he felt  inclined to discuss the matter, one of us quoted the clause from The  Hague Convention of 1907 which was signed by Germany:         The territory of neutral states is inviolable.         The fact of a neutral Power resisting even by force, attempts to       violate its neutrality cannot be regarded as a hostile act.    This was beyond him, but he reiterated: \"No civilians have any right to  fire at soldiers.\" And all the time they were killing civilians by bombs  thrown on open cities. So deep has the sanctity of the army sunk into  the German heart.    Night drew on, and one after another dropped into an uneasy sleep. But  we were squeezed so tight, and the wooden third-class carriages were so  hard, that it was almost more uncomfortable to be asleep than to be  awake. We persuaded the two German soldiers to sit together as that made  a little more room, and they soon went to sleep on each other's  shoulders, their rifles between their knees. I was still feverish and  seedy and could not sleep, but watched the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar. (#9)"],[1,"grammar book, and who never examined the principles on which it  depends. But this, by no means, proves that it is better to sing by  rote, than \"with the understanding.\" These rudiments, however, should  form the business of the nursery, rather than the grammar school. Every  mother should labor to give distinct and forcible impressions of such  things as she learns her children to _name_. She should carefully  prevent them from employing words which have no meaning, and still more  strictly should she guard them against attaching a wrong meaning to  those they do use. In this way, the foundation for future knowledge and  eminence, would be laid broad and deep. But I wander.    We attach names to imaginary things; as ghosts, genii, imps.    To this class belong the thirty thousand gods of the ancients, who were  frequently represented by emblems significant of the characters attached  to them. We employ words to name these imaginary things, so that we read  and converse about them understandingly, tho our ideas may be  exceedingly various.    Nouns are also used to express negation, of which no idea can be formed.  In this case, the mind rests on what exists, and employs a word to  express what does not. We speak of _a hole_ in the paper. But we can  form no idea of _a hole_, separated from the surrounding substances.  Remove the parts of the paper till nothing is left, and then you may  look in vain for the hole. It is not there. It never was. In the same  way we use the words nothing, nobody, nonentity, vacuum, absence, space,  blank, annihilation, and oblivion. These are relative terms, to be  understood in reference to things which are known to exist. We must know  of _some_thing before we can talk of _no_thing, of an entity before we  can think of nonentity.    In a similar way we employ words to name actions, which are produced by  the changes of objects. We speak of a race, of a flight, of a sitting or  session, of a journey, of a ride, of a walk, of a residence, etc. In all  these cases, the mind is fixed on the persons who performed these  things. Take for example, a race. Of that, we can conceive no idea  separate from the agent or object which _ran_ the _race_. Without some  other word to inform us we could not decide whether a _horse_ race, a  _foot_ race, a boat race, the race of a mill, or some other race, was  the object of remark. The same may be said of flight, for we read of the  flight of birds, the flight of Mahommed, the flight of armies, and the  flight of intellect.    We also give names to actions as tho they were taking place in the  present tense. \"The _reading_ of the report was deferred;\" steamboat  _racing_ is dangerous to public safety; _stealing_ is a crime; false  _teaching_ deserves the reprobation of all.    The hints I have given will assist you in acquiring a knowledge of nouns  as used to express ideas in vocal or written language. This subject  might be pursued further with profit, if time would permit. As the time  allotted to this lecture is nearly exhausted, I forbear. I shall  hereafter have occasion to show how a whole phrase may be used to name  an idea, and as such stand as the agent or object of a verb.    Some nouns are specifically used to designate certain objects, and  distinguish them from the class to which they usually belong. In this  way they assume a distinctive character, and are usually denominated  =proper nouns=. They apply to persons, places and things; as, John  Smith, Boston, Hylax. _Boy_ is applied in common to all young males of  the human species, and as such is a _common noun_ or name. _John Smith_  designates a particular boy from the rest.    Proper names may be also applied to animals and things. The stable  keeper and stageman has a name for every horse he owns, to distinguish  it from other horses; the dairyman for his cows, the boy for his dog,  and the girl for her doll. Any word, in fact, may become a proper name  by being specifically used; as the ship Fair Trader, the brig Success,  sloop Delight in Peace, the race horse Eclipse, Black Hawk, Round Nose,  and Red Jacket.    Proper names were formerly used in reference to certain traits of  character or circumstances connected with the place or thing. _Abram_  was changed to _Abraham_, the former signifying _an elevated father_,  the latter, _the father of a multitude_. _Isaac_ signified _laughter_,  and was given because his mother laughed at the message of the angel.  _Jacob_ signified _a supplanter_, because he was to obtain the  birthright of his elder brother.    A ridiculous rage obtained with our puritan fathers to express scripture  sentiments in the names of their children, as may be seen by consulting  the records of the Plymouth and Massachusetts colonies.    This practice has not wholly gone out of use in our day, for we hear of  the names of Hope, Mercy, Patience, Comfort, Experience, Temperance,  Faith, Deliverance, Return, and such like, applied usually to females,  (being more in character probably,) and sometimes to males. We have also  the names of White, Black, Green, Red, Gray, Brown, Olive, Whitefield,  Blackwood, Redfield, Woodhouse, Stonehouse, Waterhouse, Woodbridge,  Swiftwater, Lowater, Drinkwater, Spring, Brooks, Rivers, Pond, Lake,  Fairweather, Merryweather, Weatherhead, Rice, Wheat, Straw, Greatrakes,  Bird, Fowle, Crow, Hawks, Eagle, Partridge, Wren, Goslings, Fox, Camel,  Zebra, Bear, Wolf, Hogg, Rain, Snow, Haile, Frost, Fogg, Mudd, Clay,  Sands, Hills, Valley, Field, Stone, Flint, Silver, Gould, and Diamond.    Proper nouns may also become common when used as words of general  import; as, _dunces_, corrupted from Duns Scotus, a distinguished  theologian, born at Dunstane, Northumberland, an opposer of the  doctrines of Thomas Aquinus. He is a real _solomon_, jack tars, judases,  antichrist, and so on.    Nouns may also be considered in respect to person, number, gender, and  positive, or case. There are _three_ persons, _two_ numbers, _two_  genders, and _two_ cases. But the further consideration of these things  will be deferred, which, together with Pronouns, will form the subject  of our next lecture.          LECTURE V.    ON NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.        Nouns in respect to persons.--Number.--Singular.--Plural.--How      formed.--Foreign plurals.--Proper names admit of plurals.--Gender.      --No neuter.--In figurative language.--Errors.--Position or case.--      Agents.--Objects.--Possessive case considered.--A definitive      word.--Pronouns.--One kind.--Originally nouns.--Specifically      applied.      We resume the consideration of nouns this evening, in relation to  person, number, gender, and position or case.    In the use of language there is a speaker, person spoken to, and things  spoken of. Those who speak are the _first_ persons, those who hear the  _second_, and those who are the subject of conversation the _third_.    The first and second persons are generally used in reference to human  beings capable of speech and understanding. But we sometimes condesend  to hold converse with animals and inanimate matter. The bird trainer  talks to his parrots, the coachman to his horses, the sailor to the  winds, and the poet to his landscapes, towers, and wild imaginings, to  which he gives a \"local habitation and a name.\"    By metaphor, language is put into the mouths of animals, particularly in  fables. By a still further license, places and things, flowers, trees,  forests, brooks, lakes, mountains, towers, castles, stars, &c. are made  to speak the most eloquent language, in the first person, in addresses  the most pathetic. The propriety of such a use of words I will not stop  to question, but simply remark that such figures should never be  employed in the instruction of children. As the mind expands, no longer  content to grovel amidst mundane things, we mount the pegasus of  imagination and soar thro the blissful or terrific scenes of fancy and  fiction, and study a language before unknown. But it would be an  unrighteous demand upon others, to require them to understand us; and  quite as unpardonable to brand them with ignorance because they do not.    Most nouns are in the third person. More things are talked about than  talk themselves, or are talked to by others. Hence there is little  necessity for teaching children to specify except in the first or second  person, which is very easily done.    In English there are two _numbers_, singular and plural. The singular is  confined to one, the plural is extended to any indefinite number. The  Greeks, adopted a dual number which they used to express two objects  united in pairs, or couples; as, a span of horses, a yoke of oxen, a  brace of pistols, a pair of shoes. We express the same idea with more  words, using the singular to represent the union of the two. We also  extend this use of words and employ what are called _nouns of  multitude_; as, a people, an army, a host, a nation. These and similar  words are used in the singular referring to many combined in a united  whole, or in the plural comprehending a diversity; as, \"the armies met,\"  \"the nations are at peace.\" _People_ admits no change on account of  number. We say \"_many_ people are collected together and form _a_  numerous people.\"    The plural is not always to be understood as expressing an increase of  number, but of qualities or sorts of things, as the merchant has a  variety of _sugars_, _wines_, _teas_, _drugs_, _medicines_, _paints_ and  _dye-woods_. We also speak of _hopes_, _fears_, _loves_, _anxieties_.    Some nouns admit of no plural, in fact, or in use; as, chaos, universe,  fitness, immortality, immensity, eternity. Others admit of no singular;  as, scissors, tongs, vitals, molasses. These words probably once had  singulars, but having no use for them they became obsolete. We have long  been accustomed to associate the two halves of shears together, so that  in speaking of one whole, we say shears, and of"]]]
