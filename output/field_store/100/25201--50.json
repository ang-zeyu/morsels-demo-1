You don't know what it means for a healthy  young girl to try and support life on nuts and grasses.\"    \"And why should you?\" broke out Emerson. \"I'll tell you what it  is, Aline--you are perfectly absurd about your father. I don't  want to say anything against him to you, naturally; but--\"    \"Go ahead, George. Why this diffidence? Say what you like.\"    \"Very well, then, I will. I'll give it to you straight. You know  quite well that you have let your father bully you since you were  in short frocks. I don't say it is your fault or his fault, or  anybody's fault; I just state it as a fact. It's temperament, I  suppose. You are yielding and he is aggressive; and he has taken  advantage of it.    \"We now come to this idiotic Freddie-marriage business. Your  father has forced you into that. It's all very well to say that  you are a free agent and that fathers don't coerce their  daughters nowadays. The trouble is that your father does. You let  him do what he likes with you. He has got you hypnotized; and you  won't break away from this Freddie foolishness because you can't  find the nerve. I'm going to help you find the nerve. I'm coming  down to Blandings Castle when you go there on Friday.\"    \"Coming to Blandings!\"    \"Freddie invited me last night. I think it was done by way of  interest on the money he owed me; but he did it and I accepted.\"    \"But, George, my dear boy, do you never read the etiquette books  and the hints in the Sunday papers on how to be the perfect  gentleman? Don't you know you can't be a man's guest and take  advantage of his hospitality to try to steal his fiancee away  from him?\"    \"Watch me.\"    A dreamy look came into Aline's eyes. \"I wonder what it feels  like, being a countess,\" she said.    \"You will never know.\" George looked at her pityingly. \"My poor  girl,\" he said, \"have you been lured into this engagement in the  belief that pop-eyed Frederick, the Idiot Child, is going to be  an earl some day? You have been stung! Freddie is not the heir.  His older brother, Lord Bosham, is as fit as a prize-fighter and  has three healthy sons. Freddie has about as much chance of  getting the title as I have.\"    \"George, your education has been sadly neglected. Don't you know  that the heir to the title always goes on a yachting cruise, with  his whole family, and gets drowned--and the children too? It  happens in every English novel you read.\"    \"Listen, Aline! Let us get this thing straight: I have been in  love with you since I wore knickerbockers. I proposed to you at  your first dance--\"    \"Very clumsily.\"    \"But sincerely. Last year, when I found that you had gone to  England, I came on after you as soon as the firm could spare me.  And I found you engaged to this Freddie excrescence.\"    \"I like the way you stand up for Freddie. So many men in your  position might say horrid things about him.\"    \"Oh, I've nothing against Freddie. He is practically an imbecile  and I don't like his face; outside of that he's all right. But  you will be glad later that you did not marry him. You are much  too real a person. What a wife you will make for a hard-working  man!\"    \"What does Freddie work hard at?\"    \"I am alluding at the moment not to Freddie but to myself. I  shall come home tired out. Maybe things will have gone wrong  downtown. I shall be fagged, disheartened. And then you will come  with your cool, white hands and, placing them gently on my  forehead--\"    Aline shook her head. \"It's no good, George. Really, you had  better realize it. I'm very fond of you, but we are not suited!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"You are too overwhelming--too much like a bomb. I think you must  be one of the supermen one reads about. You would want your own  way and nothing but your own way. Now, Freddie will roll through  hoops and sham dead, and we shall be the happiest pair in the  world. I am much too placid and mild to make you happy. You want  somebody who would stand up to you--somebody like Joan  Valentine.\"    \"That's the second time you have mentioned this Joan Valentine.  Who is she?\"    \"She is a girl who was at school with me. We were the greatest  chums--at least, I worshiped her and would have done anything for  her; and I think she liked me. Then we lost touch with one  another and didn't meet for years. I met her on the street  yesterday, and she is just the same. She has been through the  most awful times. Her father was quite rich; he died suddenly  while he and Joan were in Paris, and she found that he hadn't  left a cent. He had been living right up to his income all the  time. His life wasn't even insured. She came to London; and, so  far as I could make out from the short talk we had, she has done  pretty nearly everything since we last met. She worked in a shop  and went on the stage, and all sorts of things. Isn't it awful,  George!\"    \"Pretty tough,\" said Emerson. He was but faintly interested in  Miss Valentine.    \"She is so plucky and full of life. She would stand up to you.\"    \"Thanks! My idea of marriage is not a perpetual scrap. My notion  of a wife is something cozy and sympathetic and soothing. That  is why I love you. We shall be the happiest--\"    Aline laughed.    \"Dear old George! Now pay the check and get me a taxi. I've  endless things to do at home. If Freddie is in town I suppose he  will be calling to see me. Who is Freddie, do you ask? Freddie is  my fiance, George. My betrothed. My steady. The young man I'm  going to marry.\"    Emerson shook his head resignedly. \"Curious how you cling to that  Freddie idea. Never mind! I'll come down to Blandings on Friday  and we shall see what happens. Bear in mind the broad fact that  you and I are going to be married, and that nothing on earth is  going to stop us.\"                            *   *   *    It was Aline Peters who had to bear the brunt of her father's  mental agony when he discovered, shortly after Lord Emsworth had  left him, that the gem of his collection of scarabs had done the  same. It is always the innocent bystander who suffers.    \"The darned old sneak thief!\" said Mr. Peters.    \"Father!\"    \"Don't sit there saying 'Father!' What's the use of saying  'Father!'? Do you think it is going to help--your saying  'Father!'? I'd rather the old pirate had taken the house and lot  than that scarab. He knows what's what! Trust him to walk off  with the pick of the whole bunch! I did think I could leave the  father of the man who's going to marry my daughter for a second  alone with the things. There's no morality among  collectors--none! I'd trust a syndicate of Jesse James, Captain  Kidd and Dick Turpin sooner than I would a collector. My Cheops  of the Fourth Dynasty! I wouldn't have lost it for five thousand  dollars!\"    \"But, father, couldn't you write him a letter, asking for it  back? He's such a nice old man! I'm sure he didn't mean to steal  the scarab.\"    Mr. Peters' overwrought soul blew off steam in the shape of a  passionate snort.    \"Didn't mean to steal it! What do you think he meant to do--take  it away and keep it safe for me for fear I should lose it? Didn't  mean to steal it! Bet you he's well-known in society as a  kleptomaniac. Bet you that when his name is announced his friends  pick up their spoons and send in a hurry call to police  headquarters for a squad to come and see that he doesn't sneak  the front door. Of course he meant to steal it! He has a museum  of his own down in the country. My Cheops is going to lend tone  to that. I'd give five thousand dollars to get it back. If  there's a man in this country with the spirit to break into that  castle and steal that scarab and hand it back to me, there's five  thousand waiting for him right here; and if he wants to he can  knock that old safe blower on the head with a jimmy into the  bargain.\"    \"But, father, why can't you simply go to him and say it's yours  and that you must have it back?\"    \"And have him come back at me by calling off this engagement of  yours? Not if I know it! You can't go about the place charging a  man with theft and ask him to go on being willing to have his son  marry your daughter, can you? The slightest suggestion that I  thought he had stolen this scarab and he would do the Proud Old  English Aristocrat and end everything. He's in the strongest  position a thief has ever been in. You can't get at him.\"    \"I didn't think of that.\"    \"You don't think at all. That's the trouble with you,\" said Mr.  Peters.    Years of indigestion had made Mr. Peters' temper, even when in a  normal mood, perfectly impossible; in a crisis like this it ran  amuck. He vented it on Aline because he had always vented his  irritabilities on Aline; because the fact of her sweet, gentle  disposition, combined with the fact of their relationship, made  her the ideal person to receive the overflow of his black moods.  While his wife had lived he had bullied her. On her death Aline  had stepped into the vacant position.    Aline did not cry, because she was not a girl who was given to  tears; but, for all her placid good temper, she was wounded. She  was a girl who liked everything in the world to run smoothly and  easily, and these scenes with her father always depressed her.  She took advantage of a lull in Mr. Peters' flow of words and  slipped from the room.    Her cheerfulness had received a shock. She wanted sympathy. She  wanted comforting. For a moment she considered George Emerson in  the role of comforter; but there were objections to George in  this character. Aline was accustomed to tease and chat with  George, but at heart she was a little afraid of him; and instinct  told her that, as comforter, he would be too volcanic and  supermanly for a girl who was engaged to marry another man in  June. George, as comforter, would be far too prone to trust to  action rather than to the soothing power of the spoken word.

When you have  discovered how one organ is adapted to another and to the whole, you  have gone a certain way towards understanding it. That is using  teleology as a regulative principle, in Kant's sense of the word.  Cuvier was indeed a teleologist after the fashion of Kant, and there  can be no doubt that he was influenced, at least in the exposition of  his ideas, by Kant's _Kritik der Urtheilskraft_, which appeared ten  years before the publication of the _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_.  Teleology in Kant's sense is and will always be a necessary postulate  of biology. It does not supply an explanation of organic forms and  activities, but without it one cannot even begin to understand living  things. Adaptedness is the most general fact of life, and innumerable  lesser facts can be grouped as particular cases of it, can be, so far,  understood.    Cuvier's famous principle of correlation, the corner-stone of his  work, is simply the practical application to the facts of structure of  the principle of functional adaptedness. By the principle of  correlation, from one part of an animal, given sufficient knowledge of  the structure of its like, you can in a general way construct the  whole. \"This must necessarily be so: for all the organs of an animal  form a single system, the parts of which hang together, and act and  re-act upon one another; and no modifications can appear in one part  without bringing about corresponding modifications in all the  rest.\"[47] The logical basis of the principle is sound. The functions  of the parts are all intimately bound up with one another, and one  function cannot vary without bringing in its train corresponding  modifications in the others. Structure and function are bound up  together; every modification of a function entails therefore the  modification of an organ. Hence from the shape of one organ you can  infer the shape of the other organs--if you have sufficiently  extensive empirical knowledge of functions, and of the relation of  structure to function in each kind of organ. Given an alimentary canal  capable of digesting only flesh, and possessing therefore a certain  form, you know that the other functions must be adapted to this  particular function of the alimentary canal. The animal must have keen  sight, fine smell, speed, agility, and strength in paws and jaws.  These particular functions must have correspondingly modified organs,  well-developed eyes and ears, claws and teeth. Further, you know from  experience that such and such definitely modified organs are  invariably found with the carnivorous habit, carnassial teeth, for  example, and reduced clavicles. From a \"carnivorous\" alimentary canal,  then, you can infer with certainty that the animal possessed  carnassial teeth and the other structural peculiarities of carnivorous  animals, _e.g._, the peculiar coronoid process of the mandible. From  the carnassial tooth you can infer the reduced clavicle, and so on.  \"In a word, the form of the tooth implies the form of the condyle;  that of the shoulder blade that of the claws, just as the equation of  a curve implies all its properties.\"[48]    Similarly the great respiratory power of birds is correlated with  their great muscular strength, and renders necessary great digestive  powers. Hence the correlated structure of lungs, muscles and their  attachments, and alimentary canal, in birds.    Not only do systems of organs, by being adjusted to special  modifications of function, influence one another, but so also do parts  of the same organ. This is noticeably the case with the skeleton,  where hardly a facet can vary without the others varying  proportionately, so that from one bone you can up to a certain point  deduce all the rest.    We deduce the necessity, the constancy, of these co-existences of  organs from the observed reciprocal influence of their functions. That  being established, we can argue from observed constancy of relation  between two organs an action of one upon the other, and so be led to a  discovery of their functions. But even if we do not discover the  functional interdependencies of the parts, we can use the established  fact of the constant co-existence of two parts as proof of a  functional correlation between them.    Correlation is either a rational or an empirical principle, according  as we know or do not know the interdependence of function of which it  is the expression. Even when we apply the rational principle of  correlation it would be useless in our hands if we had not extensive  empirical knowledge; when we use an empirical rule of correlation we  depend entirely upon observation. \"There are a great many cases,\"  writes Cuvier,[49] \"where our theoretical knowledge of the relations of  forms would not suffice, if it were not filled out by observation,\"  that is to say, there are many cases of correlation not yet explicable  in terms of function. From a hoof you can deduce the main characters  of herbivores (with a certain amount of assistance from your empirical  knowledge of herbivores), but could you from a cloven hoof deduce that  the animal is a ruminant, unless you had observed the constancy of  relation, not directly explicable in terms of function, between cloven  hoofs and chewing the cud? Or could you deduce from the existence of  frontal horns that the animal ruminates? \"Nevertheless, since these  relations are constant, they must necessarily have a sufficient cause;  but as we are ignorant of this cause, observation must supplement  theory; observation establishes empirical laws which become almost as  certain as the rational laws, when they are based upon a sufficient  number of observations.... But that there exist all the same hidden  reasons for all these relations is partly revealed by observation  itself, independently of general philosophy.\"[50] That is to say, even  correlations for which no explanation in terms of function can be  supplied are probably in reality functional correlations. This may, in  some cases, be inferred from the graded correspondence of two sets of  organs. For example, ungulates which do not ruminate, and have not a  cloven hoof, have a more perfect dentition and more bones in the foot  than the true cloven-hoofed ruminants. There is a correlation between  the state of development of the teeth and of the foot. This  correlation is a graded one, for camels, which have a more perfect  dentition than other ruminants, have also a bone more in their tarsus.  It seems probable, therefore, that there is some reason, that is, some  explanation in terms of function, for this case of correlation.    Nevertheless, the fact remains that many correlations are not  explicable in terms of function, and the substitution of correlation  as an empirical principle for correlation as a rational principle  marks for Cuvier a step away from his functional comparative anatomy  towards a pure morphology. It is significant that in later times the  term correlation has come to be applied more especially to the purely  empirical constancies of relation, and has lost most of its functional  significance. But the correlation of the parts of an organism is no  mere mathematical concept, to be expressed by a coefficient, but  something deeper and more vital.    Cuvier interpreted the functional dependence of the parts in terms of  what we now call the general metabolism. He had a clear vision of the  constant movement of molecules in the living tissue, combining and  recombining, of the organism taking in and intercalating molecules  from outside from the food and rejecting molecules in the excretions,  a ceaseless _tourbillon vital_. \"This general movement, universal in  every part, is so unmistakably the very essence of life that parts  separated from a living body straightway die.\"[51] The organisation of  the body, the arrangement of its solids and liquids, is adapted to  further the _tourbillon vital_. \"Each part contributes to this general  movement its own particular action and is affected by it in particular  ways, with the result that, in every being, life is a unity which  results from the mutual action and reaction of all its parts.\"[52]    Cuvier, however, did not resolve life into metabolism, nor reduce  vital happenings to the chemical level. The form of organised bodies  is more essential than the matter of which they are composed, for the  matter changes ceaselessly while the form remains unchanged. It is in  form that we must seek the differences between species, and not in the  combinations of matter, which are almost the same in all.[53] The  differences are to be sought at the level of the second and third  degrees of composition.    The existence of differences of form introduces a new problem, the  problem of diversity. There are only a few possible combinations of  the principal organs, but as you get down to less important parts the  possible scope of variation is greatly increased, and most of the  possible variations do exist. Nature seems prodigal of form, of form  which needs not to be useful in order to exist. \"It needs only to be  possible, _i.e._, of such a character that it does not, destroy the  harmony of the whole.\"[54] We seize here the relation of the principle  of the adaptedness of parts to the problem of the variety of form. The  former is in a sense a regulative and conservative principle which  lays down limits beyond which variation may not stray. In itself it is  not a fountain of change; there must be another cause of change. This  thought is of great importance for theories of descent.    Cuvier has no theory to account for the variety of form: he contents  himself with a classification. There are two main ways of classifying  forms; you may classify according to single organs or according to the  totality of organs. By the first method you can have as many  classifications as"]]]
