[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1947"],[0,"Scaramouche: A Romance of the French Revolution (#9)"],[1," ushered through a narrow but very massive and richly  decorated door into a fine, well-lighted room furnished with enough gilt  and satin to have supplied the boudoir of a lady of fashion.    It was a trivial setting for a King's Lieutenant, but about the King's  Lieutenant there was--at least to ordinary eyes--nothing trivial. At the  far end of the chamber, to the right of one of the tall windows that  looked out over the inner court, before a goat-legged writing-table with  Watteau panels, heavily encrusted with ormolu, sat that exalted being.  Above a scarlet coat with an order flaming on its breast, and a billow  of lace in which diamonds sparkled like drops of water, sprouted the  massive powdered head of M. de Lesdiguieres. It was thrown back to scowl  upon this visitor with an expectant arrogance that made Andre-Louis  wonder almost was a genuflexion awaited from him.    Perceiving a lean, lantern-jawed young man, with straight, lank black  hair, in a caped riding-coat of brown cloth, and yellow buckskin  breeches, his knee-boots splashed with mud, the scowl upon that august  visage deepened until it brought together the thick black eyebrows above  the great hooked nose.    \"You announce yourself as a lawyer of Gavrillac with an important  communication,\" he growled. It was a peremptory command to make this  communication without wasting the valuable time of a King's Lieutenant,  of whose immense importance it conveyed something more than a hint. M.  de Lesdiguieres accounted himself an imposing personality, and he had  every reason to do so, for in his time he had seen many a poor devil  scared out of all his senses by the thunder of his voice.    He waited now to see the same thing happen to this youthful lawyer from  Gavrillac. But he waited in vain.    Andre-Louis found him ridiculous. He knew pretentiousness for the  mask of worthlessness and weakness. And here he beheld pretentiousness  incarnate. It was to be read in that arrogant poise of the head, that  scowling brow, the inflexion of that reverberating voice. Even more  difficult than it is for a man to be a hero to his valet--who has  witnessed the dispersal of the parts that make up the imposing whole--is  it for a man to be a hero to the student of Man who has witnessed the  same in a different sense.    Andre-Louis stood forward boldly--impudently, thought M. de Lesdiguieres.    \"You are His Majesty's Lieutenant here in Brittany,\" he said--and it  almost seemed to the august lord of life and death that this fellow had  the incredible effrontery to address him as one man speaking to another.  \"You are the dispenser of the King's high justice in this province.\"    Surprise spread on that handsome, sallow face under the heavily powdered  wig.    \"Is your business concerned with this infernal insubordination of the  canaille?\" he asked.    \"It is not, monsieur.\"    The black eyebrows rose. \"Then what the devil do you mean by intruding  upon me at a time when all my attention is being claimed by the obvious  urgency of this disgraceful affair?\"    \"The affair that brings me is no less disgraceful and no less urgent.\"    \"It will have to wait!\" thundered the great man in a passion, and  tossing back a cloud of lace from his hand, he reached for the little  silver bell upon his table.    \"A moment, monsieur!\" Andre-Louis' tone was peremptory. M. de  Lesdiguieres checked in sheer amazement at its impudence. \"I can state  it very briefly...\"    \"Haven't I said already...\"    \"And when you have heard it,\" Andre-Louis went on, relentlessly,  interrupting the interruption, \"you will agree with me as to its  character.\"    M. de Lesdiguieres considered him very sternly.    \"What is your name?\" he asked.    \"Andre-Louis Moreau.\"    \"Well, Andre-Louis Moreau, if you can state your plea briefly, I will  hear you. But I warn you that I shall be very angry if you fail to  justify the impertinence of this insistence at so inopportune a moment.\"    \"You shall be the judge of that, monsieur,\" said Andre-Louis, and he  proceeded at once to state his case, beginning with the shooting of  Mabey, and passing thence to the killing of M. de Vilmorin. But he  withheld until the end the name of the great gentleman against whom he  demanded justice, persuaded that did he introduce it earlier he would  not be allowed to proceed.    He had a gift of oratory of whose full powers he was himself hardly  conscious yet, though destined very soon to become so. He told his story  well, without exaggeration, yet with a force of simple appeal that was  irresistible. Gradually the great man's face relaxed from its forbidding  severity. Interest, warming almost to sympathy, came to be reflected on  it.    \"And who, sir, is the man you charge with this?\"    \"The Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\"    The effect of that formidable name was immediate. Dismayed anger, and an  arrogance more utter than before, took the place of the sympathy he had  been betrayed into displaying.    \"Who?\" he shouted, and without waiting for an answer, \"Why, here's  impudence,\" he stormed on, \"to come before me with such a charge against  a gentleman of M. de La Tour d'Azyr's eminence! How dare you speak of  him as a coward....\"    \"I speak of him as a murderer,\" the young man corrected. \"And I demand  justice against him.\"    \"You demand it, do you? My God, what next?\"    \"That is for you to say, monsieur.\"    It surprised the great gentleman into a more or less successful effort  of self-control.    \"Let me warn you,\" said he, acidly, \"that it is not wise to make  wild accusations against a nobleman. That, in itself, is a punishable  offence, as you may learn. Now listen to me. In this matter of  Mabey--assuming your statement of it to be exact--the gamekeeper may have  exceeded his duty; but by so little that it is hardly worth comment.  Consider, however, that in any case it is not a matter for the King's  Lieutenant, or for any court but the seigneurial court of M. de La Tour  d'Azyr himself. It is before the magistrates of his own appointing that  such a matter must be laid, since it is matter strictly concerning his  own seigneurial jurisdiction. As a lawyer you should not need to be told  so much.\"    \"As a lawyer, I am prepared to argue the point. But, as a lawyer I also  realize that if that case were prosecuted, it could only end in the  unjust punishment of a wretched gamekeeper, who did no more than carry  out his orders, but who none the less would now be made a scapegoat,  if scapegoat were necessary. I am not concerned to hang Benet on the  gallows earned by M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\"    M. de Lesdiguieres smote the table violently. \"My God!\" he cried out, to  add more quietly, on a note of menace, \"You are singularly insolent, my  man.\"    \"That is not my intention, sir, I assure you. I am a lawyer, pleading a  case--the case of M. de Vilmorin. It is for his assassination that I have  come to beg the King's justice.\"    \"But you yourself have said that it was a duel!\" cried the Lieutenant,  between anger and bewilderment.    \"I have said that it was made to appear a duel. There is a distinction,  as I shall show, if you will condescend to hear me out.\"    \"Take your own time, sir!\" said the ironical M. de Lesdiguieres, whose  tenure of office had never yet held anything that remotely resembled  this experience.    Andre-Louis took him literally. \"I thank you, sir,\" he answered,  solemnly, and submitted his argument. \"It can be shown that M. de  Vilmorin never practised fencing in all his life, and it is notorious  that M. de La Tour d'Azyr is an exceptional swordsman. Is it a duel,  monsieur, where one of the combatants alone is armed? For it amounts to  that on a comparison of their measures of respective skill.\"    \"There has scarcely been a duel fought on which the same trumpery  argument might not be advanced.\"    \"But not always with equal justice. And in one case, at least, it was  advanced successfully.\"    \"Successfully? When was that?\"    \"Ten years ago, in Dauphiny. I refer to the case of M. de Gesvres,  a gentleman of that province, who forced a duel upon M. de la Roche  Jeannine, and killed him. M. de Jeannine was a member of a powerful  family, which exerted itself to obtain justice. It put forward just  such arguments as now obtain against M. de La Tour d'Azyr. As you will  remember, the judges held that the provocation had proceeded of intent  from M. de Gesvres; they found him guilty of premeditated murder, and he  was hanged.\"    M. de Lesdiguieres exploded yet again. \"Death of my life!\" he cried.  \"Have you the effrontery to suggest that M. de La Tour d'Azyr should be  hanged? Have you?\"    \"But why not, monsieur, if it is the law, and there is precedent for it,  as I have shown you, and if it can be established that what I state is  the truth--as established it can be without difficulty?\"    \"Do you ask me, why not? Have you temerity to ask me that?\"    \"I have, monsieur. Can you answer me? If you cannot, monsieur, I shall  understand that whilst it is possible for a powerful family like that  of La Roche Jeannine to set the law in motion, the law must remain inert  for the obscure and uninfluential, however brutally wronged by a great  nobleman.\"    M. de Lesdiguieres perceived that in argument he would accomplish  nothing against this impassive, resolute young man. The menace of him  grew more fierce.    \"I should advise you to take yourself off at once, and to be thankful  for the opportunity to depart unscathed.\"    \"I am, then, to understand, monsieur, that there will be no inquiry into  this case? That nothing that I can say will move you?\"    \"You are to understand that if you are still there in two minutes it  will be very much the worse for you.\" And M. de Lesdiguieres tinkled the  silver hand-bell upon his table.    \"I have informed you, monsieur, that a duel--so-called--has been fought,  and a man killed. It seems that I must remind you, the administrator of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#9)"],[1,"ture.    The slab inside the open arcade, which forms the upper stage, still bears  the matrix of the brass of an episcopal figure having traces of the arms  of the See (_i.e._, the arms of Cantilupe).    By the dedication of the north transept especially to Bishop Cantilupe was  avoided the secondary part which his shrine must have played if it had  been placed in the usual post of honour at the back of the high altar. The  shrine of St. Ethelbert was probably already there, and wisely enough a  distinguished position was specially created by rebuilding the north  transept for the purpose. There is a similar state of affairs at Oxford  Cathedral with the shrine of St. Frideswide, and in the south transept of  Chichester Cathedral with that of St. Richard de la Wych.    We note also a brass to Dean Frowcester, 1529; and another to Richard  Delamare and his wife Isabella (1435).    Near the Cantilupe shrine is a bust of Bishop Field (died 1636), and on  the floor is an effigy of John D'Acquablanca, a Dean of Hereford (died  1320), and nephew of Bishop D'Acquablanca, whose beautiful monument is  close to it, between the north choir-aisle and the eastern aisle of the  transept. Beholding the exquisite grace of this tomb we are reminded of  the more elaborate and equally beautiful chantry of the same period (1262)  in the south choir transept of Salisbury to Bishop Giles de Bridport.    Over the effigy, which is a most interesting example of minute  ecclesiastical costume, delicate shafts of Purbeck marble support a gabled  canopy, each gable of which is surmounted by a finial in the form of a  floriated cross.    This monument once glowed with rich colour, and in 1861 a feeble attempt  was made to restore it, which was, however, not carried out. Bishop  Aquablanca, Peter of Savoy, had been steward of the household to his  relative, William of Savoy, the Queen's uncle. His preferment was one of  the noteworthy instances of Henry III.'s love of foreigners, and as Bishop  of Hereford he was especially unpopular. The King made him his treasurer  and consulted him on all matters of state. At his death, says the Rev. H.  W. Phillott,(2) \"He was probably little regretted in his cathedral city,  whose citizens he had defeated in an attempt to encroach on his episcopal  rights. But he used his victory with moderation, for he forgave them one  half of their fine and devoted the other half to the fabric of the  cathedral, probably that noble and graceful portion of it, the north-west  transept, which contains the exquisitely beautiful shrine, probably  erected by himself, under which repose the remains of his nephew, John,  Dean of Hereford, as well as his own, his heart excepted, which, with a  pathetic yearning of home-sickness, he desired should be carried to the  church which he had founded in his own sunny land at Aigue-Belle, in  Savoy. Yet, though his memory has received no mercy at the hands of  historians and song-writers of his day, though his example did much to  swell the tide of ill-repute in which many of the clergy of all ranks were  held (for the laity, says the song-writer, are apt to pay less attention  to the doctrine than to the life of their teachers), we ought not to leave  out of sight that he did much to improve the fabric of the Cathedral, and  bequeathed liberal gifts to its foundation in money, books, ornaments, and  land, and also a handsome legacy to the poor of the diocese.\"                      [Illustration: THE CANTILUPE SHRINE.]                              THE CANTILUPE SHRINE.      In the north transept is a doorway leading to the tower.    *South Transept.*--Crossing the Cathedral in front of the Skidmore screen  it is a relief to turn from the nave with its sham triforium to the south  transept with its fine three stage Norman east side. The groining,  although incongruous, is still beautiful, and does not irritate in the  same way as Wyatt's abominations in the nave. This transept contains  several disputed architectural points, and opinions are divided as to  whether it may not be the oldest existing portion of the Cathedral. \"At  any rate,\" says G. Phillips Bevan,(3) \"this transept seems to have been  the happy hunting-ground of successive races of builders, who have left  the side-walls in admired confusion.\"    Though it underwent great alteration in the Perpendicular period much of  the Norman work remains. The east wall is in the best preservation, and is  certainly entirely Norman with the exception of the groining. It is  covered with five series of arcades, which may be divided into three  stages. In the middle stage is a notably good triforium passage of very  short Norman arches. All the other ranges of arcades, except those at the  level of the clerestory, are blocked. On this side the transept is lighted  from the clerestory by two Norman windows.    In both east and west walls there is a very fine Norman moulded double  arch.    In the west wall Perpendicular windows have cut into the Norman work, and  a large Perpendicular window nearly fills the south wall with panelling  round it of the same period.    *Monuments in the South Transept.*--There is an interesting altar-tomb of  Sir Alexander Denton, 1576, of Hillesden, Co. Bucks, Esq., and his lady  and a child in swaddling clothes, toward the south-east angle of the  transept. The effigies are in alabaster, and retain considerable traces of  colour. They are in full proportion, and the knight wears a double chain  and holds a cross in his hands. The Dentons were ancestors of the Coke  family, now Earls of Leicester. The swaddled body of the child lies to the  left of its mother, its head resting on a little double pillow by her  knee, and a part of the red cloth on which she lies wraps over the lower  part of the babe.    To the right of the knight, balancing the child in the composition, lie  his two gauntlets or mail gloves, which have been much scratched with  names.    The head of the knight rests upon his helmet.    Round the verge of the tomb is this inscription:          \"Here lieth Alexander Denton, of Hillesden, in the County of      Buckingham, and Anne his wife, Dowghter and Heyr of Richard      Willyson of Suggerwesh in the Countie of Hereford; which Anne      deceased the 29th of October, A.D. 1566 the 18th yere of her Age,      the 23rd of his Age.\"      \"But,\" says Browne Willis, \"this was but a caenotaph, for Alexander Denton,  the husband, who lived some years after, and marry'd another lady, was  bury'd with her at Hillesden, Co. Bucks; where he died January the 18th,  1576.\"    Under the south window is an effigy of Bishop Trevenant (1389-1404), the  builder of the Perpendicular alterations in this transept. The effigy is  unfortunately headless and has lost its hands. The feet are resting on a  lion.    There is a brass to T. Smith, organist of the Cathedral (1877).    The remains of an ancient fireplace may be noticed on the west side of the  south transept.    They consist of a rectangular recess with chimney vault behind. This was  doubtless cut away when the Perpendicular window was placed above on this  side.    From this transept a beautiful side view is obtained of the lantern  arches.                 [Illustration: EAST WALL OF THE SOUTH TRANSEPT.]                         EAST WALL OF THE SOUTH TRANSEPT.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      The *Organ*, which occupies the first archway on the south side of the  choir, contains work by Renatus Harris. Mr. Phillips Bevan(4) writes of  it, \"It was the gift of Charles II., and was very nearly destroyed by the  fall of the central tower. It has twice been enlarged since, once by Gray  and Davidson, and lastly by Willis. It has 16 great organ stops, 11 swell,  7 choir, 7 solo, 8 pedals, with 2672 pipes. A great feature in Willis's  improvements is the tubular pneumatic action, which does away with  trackers and other troublesome internals. Sir F. Gore Ouseley having been  precentor of the Cathedral, it goes without saying that he made everything  about the organ as nearly perfect as possible, and, for the matter of  that, no lover of music should omit to hear the _Unaccompanied_ service  usually held on Friday morning.\"    In the south wall of the south choir-aisle are four Decorated arched  recesses containing four effigies of bishops, belonging to the  Perpendicular period. These effigies have been attributed, beginning from  the west, to R. de Melun, 1167; Robert De Bethune (died 1148), the last  Norman builder; Hugh Foliot (died 1234) or Robert Foliot (died 1186); and  William De Vere (died 1199).    On the north wall under an arch opening to the choir is the tomb of Bishop  De Lorraine or Losinga (died 1095), who superintended the building of the  fine west front of the cathedral so unfortunately destroyed. This effigy  also belongs to the Perpendicular period. The large size of the ball  flower and fine wood-carving of the Decorated period on these tombs is  noticeable.    Between the two eastern piers of the choir is the fine effigy and brass to  Bishop Mayhew, of Magdalen College (1504-1516). The effigy is wearing a  mitre, and is fully vested. In front of the monument are panels filled  with figures of saints, and over the effigy is an elaborate canopy, which  has been restored.    In the last bay to west of the south choir aisle a door gives access to  two Norman rooms, used as vestries or robing rooms, to enter which you  pass beneath the bellows of the organ. Exhibited in cases in one of these  rooms are some of the treasures of the cathedral, ancient copies of the  Scriptures, chalices, rings, etc., described in detail towards the close  of this section. A two-storied eastern chamber was added to the Norman  work in the Perpendicular period, and was used as the cathedral treasury.    Before leaving the south choir aisle the old stained glass windows with  figures restored by Warrington should be noticed, and the celebrated *Map  of"]]]
