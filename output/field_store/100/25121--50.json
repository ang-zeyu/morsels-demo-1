C.    [Footnote 9: I am again doubtful, here. The most important part of the  chapter is from Sec. 60 to end.]    But though among the Greeks it is thus nearly always difficult to say  what is symbolic and what realistic, in the range of Christian art the  distinction is clear. In that, a vast division of imaginative work is  occupied in the symbolism of virtues, vices, or natural powers or  passions; and in the representation of personages who, though nominally  real, become in conception symbolic. In the greater part of this work  there is no intention of implying the existence of the represented  creature; Duerer's Melencolia and Giotto's Justice are accurately  characteristic examples. Now all such art is wholly good and useful when  it is the work of good men.      54. Again, there is another division of Christian work in which the  persons represented, though nominally real, are treated as  dramatis-personae of a poem, and so presented confessedly as subjects of  imagination. All this poetic art is also good when it is the work of  good men.      55. There remains only therefore to be considered, as truly religious,  the work which definitely implies and modifies the conception of the  existence of a real person. There is hardly any great art which entirely  belongs to this class; but Raphael's Madonna della Seggiola is as  accurate a type of it as I can give you; Holbein's Madonna at Dresden,  the Madonna di San Sisto, and the Madonna of Titian's Assumption, all  belong mainly to this class, but are removed somewhat from it (as, I  repeat, nearly all great art is) into the poetical one. It is only the  bloody crucifixes and gilded virgins and other such lower forms of  imagery (by which, to the honour of the English Church, it has been  truly claimed for her, that \"she has never appealed to the madness or  dulness of her people,\") which belong to the realistic class in strict  limitation, and which properly constitute the type of it.    There is indeed an important school of sculpture in Spain, directed to  the same objects, but not demanding at present any special attention.  And finally, there is the vigorous and most interesting realistic school  of our own, in modern times, mainly known to the public by Holman Hunt's  picture of the Light of the World, though, I believe, deriving its first  origin from the genius of the painter to whom you owe also the revival  of interest, first here in Oxford, and then universally, in the cycle of  early English legend,--Dante Rossetti.      56. The effect of this realistic art on the religious mind of Europe  varies in scope more than any other art power; for in its higher  branches it touches the most sincere religious minds, affecting an  earnest class of persons who cannot be reached by merely poetical  design; while, in its lowest, it addresses itself not only to the most  vulgar desires for religious excitement, but to the mere thirst for  sensation of horror which characterises the uneducated orders of  partially civilised countries; nor merely to the thirst for horror, but  to the strange love of death, as such, which has sometimes in Catholic  countries showed itself peculiarly by the endeavour to paint the images  in the chapels of the Sepulchre so as to look deceptively like corpses.  The same morbid instinct has also affected the minds of many among the  more imaginative and powerful artists with a feverish gloom which  distorts their finest work; and lastly--and this is the worst of all its  effects--it has occupied the sensibility of Christian women,  universally, in lamenting the sufferings of Christ, instead of  preventing those of His people.      57. When any of you next go abroad, observe, and consider the meaning  of, the sculptures and paintings, which of every rank in art, and in  every chapel and cathedral, and by every mountain path, recall the  hours, and represent the agonies, of the Passion of Christ: and try to  form some estimate of the efforts that have been made by the four arts  of eloquence, music, painting, and sculpture, since the twelfth century,  to wring out of the hearts of women the last drops of pity that could be  excited for this merely physical agony: for the art nearly always dwells  on the physical wounds or exhaustion chiefly, and degrades, far more  than it animates, the conception of pain.    Then try to conceive the quantity of time, and of excited and thrilling  emotion, which have been wasted by the tender and delicate women of  Christendom during these last six hundred years, in thus picturing to  themselves, under the influence of such imagery, the bodily pain, long  since passed, of One Person:--which, so far as they indeed conceived it  to be sustained by a Divine Nature, could not for that reason have been  less endurable than the agonies of any simple human death by torture:  and then try to estimate what might have been the better result, for the  righteousness and felicity of mankind, if these same women had been  taught the deep meaning of the last words that were ever spoken by their  Master to those who had ministered to Him of their substance: \"Daughters  of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your  children.\" If they had but been taught to measure with their pitiful  thoughts the tortures of battle-fields--the slowly consuming plagues of  death in the starving children, and wasted age, of the innumerable  desolate those battles left;--nay, in our own life of peace, the agony  of unnurtured, untaught, unhelped creatures, awaking at the grave's edge  to know how they should have lived; and the worse pain of those whose  existence, not the ceasing of it, is death; those to whom the cradle was  a curse, and for whom the words they cannot hear, \"ashes to ashes,\" are  all that they have ever received of benediction. These,--you who would  fain have wept at His feet, or stood by His cross,--these you have  always with you! Him, you have not always.      58. The wretched in death you have always with you. Yes, and the brave  and good in life you have always;--these also needing help, though you  supposed they had only to help others; these also claiming to be thought  for, and remembered. And you will find, if you look into history with  this clue, that one of quite the chief reasons for the continual misery  of mankind is that they are always divided in their worship between  angels or saints, who are out of their sight, and need no help, and  proud and evil-minded men, who are too definitely in their sight, and  ought not to have their help. And consider how the arts have thus  followed the worship of the crowd. You have paintings of saints and  angels, innumerable;--of petty courtiers, and contemptible or cruel  kings, innumerable. Few, how few you have, (but these, observe, almost  always by great painters) of the best men, or of their actions. But  think for yourselves,--I have no time now to enter upon the mighty  field, nor imagination enough to guide me beyond the threshold of  it,--think, what history might have been to us now;--nay, what a  different history that of all Europe might have become, if it had but  been the object both of the people to discern, and of their arts to  honour and bear record of, the great deeds of their worthiest men. And  if, instead of living, as they have always hitherto done, in a hellish  cloud of contention and revenge, lighted by fantastic dreams of cloudy  sanctities, they had sought to reward and punish justly, wherever reward  and punishment were due, but chiefly to reward; and at least rather to  bear testimony to the human acts which deserved God's anger or His  blessing, than only, in presumptuous imagination, to display the secrets  of Judgment, or the beatitudes of Eternity.      59. Such I conceive generally, though indeed with good arising out of  it, for every great evil brings some good in its backward eddies--such I  conceive to have been the deadly function of art in its ministry to  what, whether in heathen or Christian lands, and whether in the  pageantry of words, or colours, or fair forms, is truly, and in the deep  sense, to be called (idolatry)--the serving with the best of our hearts  and minds, some dear or sad fantasy which we have made for ourselves,  while we disobey the present call of the Master, who is not dead, and  who is not now fainting under His cross, but requiring us to take up  ours.      60. I pass to the second great function of religious art, the limitation  of the idea of Divine presence to particular localities. It is of course  impossible within my present limits to touch upon this power of art, as  employed on the temples of the gods of various religions; we will  examine that on future occasions. To-day, I want only to map out main  ideas, and I can do this best by speaking exclusively of this localising  influence as it affects our own faith.    Observe first, that the localisation is almost entirely dependent upon  human art. You must at least take a stone and set it up for a pillar, if  you are to mark the place, so as to know it again, where a vision  appeared. A persecuted people, needing to conceal their places of  worship, may perform every religious ceremony first under one crag of  the hill-side, and then under another, without invalidating the  sacredness of the rites or sacraments thus administered. It is,  therefore, we all acknowledge, inessential, that a particular spot  should be surrounded with a ring of stones, or enclosed within walls of  a certain style of architecture, and so set apart as the only place  where such ceremonies may be properly performed; and it is thus less by  any direct appeal to experience or to reason, but in consequence of the  effect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#9)"],[1,"unter's girl, and she had told them at the  Sawtooth that she had spent the night at Rock City. He wondered how  much else she had told; how much she remembered of what she had told  him.    He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a round leather purse  with a chain handle. It was soiled and shrunken with its wetting, and  the clasp had flecks of rust upon it. What it contained Lone did not  know. Virginia had taught him that a man must not be curious about the  personal belongings of a woman. Now he turned the purse over, tried to  rub out the stiffness of the leather, and smiled a little as he dropped  it back into his pocket.    \"I've got my calling card,\" he said softly to John Doe. \"I reckon I had  the right hunch when I didn't turn it over to Mrs. Hawkins. I'll ask her  again about that grip she said she hid under a bush. I never heard about  any of the boys finding it.\"    His thoughts returned to Al Woodruff and stopped there. Determined still  to attend strictly to his own affairs, his thoughts persisted in playing  truant and in straying to a subject he much preferred not to think of at  all. Why should Al Woodruff be interested in the exact spot where Brit  Hunter's daughter had spent the night of the storm? Why should Lone  instinctively discount her statement and lie whole-heartedly about it?    \"Now if Al catches me up in that, he'll think I know a lot I don't know,  or else----\" He halted his thoughts there, for that, too, was a  forbidden subject.    Forbidden subjects are like other forbidden things: they have a way of  making themselves very conspicuous. Lone was heading for the Quirt ranch  by the most direct route, fearing, perhaps, that if he waited he would  lose his nerve and would not go at all. Yet it was important that he  should go; he must return the girl's purse!    The most direct route to the Quirt took him down Juniper Ridge and  across Granite Creek near the Thurman ranch. Indeed, if he followed the  trail up Granite Creek and across the hilly country to Quirt Creek, he  must pass within fifty yards of the Thurman cabin. Lone's time was  limited, yet he took the direct route rather reluctantly. He did not  want to be reminded too sharply of Fred Thurman as a man who had lived  his life in his own way and had died so horribly.    \"Well, he didn't have it coming to him--but it's done and over with,  now, so it's no use thinking about it,\" he reflected, when the roofs of  the Thurman ranch buildings began to show now and then through the thin  ranks of the cottonwoods along the creek.    But his face sobered as he rode along. It seemed to him that the sleepy  little meadows, the quiet murmuring of the creek, even the soft rustling  of the cottonwood leaves breathed a new loneliness, an emptiness where  the man who had called this place home, who had clung to it in the face  of opposition that was growing into open warfare, had lived and had left  life suddenly--unwarrantably, Lone knew in his heart. It might be of no  use to think about it, but the vivid memory of Fred Thurman was with him  when he rode up the trail to the stable and the small corrals. He had to  think, whether he would or no.    At the corral he came unexpectedly in sight of the Swede, who grinned a  guileless welcome and came toward him, so that Lone could not ride on  unless he would advertise his dislike of the place. John Doe, plainly  glad to find an excuse to stop, slowed and came to where Swan waited by  the gate.    \"By golly, this is lonesome here,\" Swan complained, heaving a great  sigh. \"That judge don't get busy pretty quick, I'm maybe jumping my job.  Lone, what you think? You believe in ghosts?\"    \"Naw. What's on your chest, Swan?\" Lone slipped sidewise in the saddle,  resting his muscles. \"You been seeing things?\"    \"No--I don't be seeing things, Lone. But sometimes I been--like I _feel_  something.\" He stared at Lone questioningly. \"What you think, Lone, if  you be sitting down eating your supper, maybe, and you feel something  say words in your brain? Like you know something talks to you and then  quits.\"    Lone gave Swan a long, measuring look, and Swan laughed uneasily.    \"That sounds crazy. But it's true, what something tells me in my brain.  I go and look, and by golly, it's there just like the words tell me.\"    Lone straightened in the saddle. \"You better come clean, Swan, and tell  the whole thing. What was it? Don't talk in circles. What words did you  feel--in your brain?\" In spite of himself, Lone felt as he had when the  girl had talked to him and called him Charlie.    Swan closed the gate behind him with steady hands. His lips were pressed  firmly together, as if he had definitely made up his mind to something.  Lone was impressed somehow with Swan's perfect control of his speech,  his thoughts, his actions. But he was puzzled rather than anything else,  and when Swan turned, facing him, Lone's bewilderment did not lessen.    \"I'll tell you. It's when I'm sitting down to eat my supper. I'm just  reaching out my hand like this, to get my coffee. And something says in  my head, 'It's a lie. I don't ride backwards. Go look at my saddle.  There's blood----' And that's all. It's like the words go far away so I  can't hear any more. So I eat my supper, and then I get the lantern and  I go look. You come with me, Lone. I'll show you.\"    Without a word Lone dismounted and followed Swan into a small shed  beside the stable, where a worn stock saddle hung suspended from a  crosspiece, a rawhide string looped over the horn. Lone did not ask  whose saddle it was, nor did Swan name the owner. There was no need.    Swan took the saddle and swung it around so that the right side was  toward them. It was what is called a full-stamped saddle, with the  popular wild-rose design on skirts and cantle. Much hard use and  occasional oilings had darkened the leather to a rich, red brown, marred  with old scars and scratches and the stains of many storms.    \"Blood is hard to find when it's raining all night,\" Swan observed,  speaking low as one does in the presence of death. \"But if somebody is  bleeding and falls off a horse slow, and catches hold of things and  tries like hell to hang on----\" He lifted the small flap that covered  the cinch ring and revealed a reddish, flaked stain. Phlegmatically he  wetted his finger tip on his tongue, rubbed the stain and held up his  finger for Lone to see. \"That's a damn funny place for blood, when a man  is dragging on the ground,\" he commented drily. \"And something else is  damn funny, Lone.\"    He lifted the wooden stirrup and touched with his finger the rowel  marks. \"That is on the front part,\" he said. \"I could swear in court  that Fred's left foot was twisted--that's damn funny, Lone. I don't see  men ride backwards, much.\"    Lone turned on him and struck the stirrup from his hand. \"I think you  better forget it,\" he said fiercely. \"He's dead--it can't help him any  to----\" He stopped and pulled himself together. \"Swan, you take a fool's  advice and don't tell anybody else about feeling words talk in your  head. They'll have you in the bug-house at Blackfoot, sure as you live.\"  He looked at the saddle, hesitated, looked again at Swan, who was  watching him. \"That blood most likely got there when Fred was packing a  deer in from the hills. And marks on them old oxbow stirrups don't mean  a damn thing but the need of a new pair, maybe.\" He forced a laugh and  stepped outside the shed. \"Just shows you, Swan, that imagination and  being alone all the time can raise Cain with a fellow. You want to watch  yourself.\"    Swan followed him out, closing the door carefully behind him. \"By golly,  I'm watching out now,\" he assented thoughtfully. \"You don't tell  anybody, Lone.\"    \"No, I won't tell anybody--and I'd advise you not to,\" Lone repeated  grimly. \"Just keep those thoughts outa your head, Swan. They're bad  medicine.\"    He mounted John Doe and rode away, his eyes downcast, his quirt slapping  absently the weeds along the trail. It was not his business, and  yet---- Lone shook himself together and put John Doe into a lope. He had  warned Swan, and he could do no more.    Halfway to the Quirt he met Lorraine riding along the trail. She would  have passed him with no sign of recognition, but Lone lifted his hat and  stopped. Lorraine looked at him, rode on a few steps and turned. \"Did  you wish to speak about something?\" she asked impersonally.    Lone felt the flush in his cheeks, which angered him to the point of  speaking curtly. \"Yes. I found your purse where you dropped it that  night you were lost. I was bringing it over to you. My name's Morgan.  I'm the man that found you and took you in to the ranch.\"    \"Oh.\" Lorraine looked at him steadily. \"You're the one they call Loney?\"    \"When they're feeling good toward me. I'm Lone Morgan. I went back to  find your grip--you said you left it under a bush, but the world's plumb  full of bushes. I found your purse, though.\"    \"Thank you so much. I must have been an awful nuisance, but I was so  scared--and things were terribly mixed in my mind. I didn't even have  sense enough to tell you what ranch I was trying to find, did I? So you  took me to the wrong one, and I was a week there before I found it out.  And then they were perfectly lovely about it and brought me--home.\" She  turned the purse over and over in her hands, looking at it without much  interest. She seemed in no hurry to ride on, which gave Lone courage.    \"There's something I'd like to say,\" he began, groping for words that  would make his meaning plain without telling too much. \"I hope you won't  mind my telling you. You were kinda out of your head when I found you,  and you said something about seeing a man shot and----\"    \"Oh!\" Lorraine looked up at him, looked through him, he thought, with  those brilliant eyes of hers. \"Then I did tell----\"    \"I just wanted to say,\" Lone interrupted her, \"that I knew all the time  it was"]]]
