Volume I (of X) - Greece (#9)"],[1,"; send an army at once into Attica and  assist your allies, especially the Potidaeans, to whom your word is  pledged. Do not allow friends and kindred to fall into the hands of  their worst enemies, or drive us in despair to seek the alliance of  others; in taking such a course we should be doing wrong either before  the gods who are witnesses of our oaths or before men whose eyes are  upon us. For the true breakers of treaties are not only those who,  when forsaken, turn to others, but those who forsake allies whom they  have sworn to defend. We will remain your friends if you choose to  bestir yourselves; for we should be guilty of an impiety if we  deserted you without cause; and we shall not easily find allies  equally congenial to us. Take heed then; you have inherited from your  fathers the leadership of Peloponnesus; see that her greatness suffers  no diminution at your hands.\"    Thus spake the Corinthians. Now there happened to be staying at  Lacedaemon an Athenian embassy which had come on other business, and  when the envoys heard what the Corinthians had said, they felt bound  to go before the Lacedaemonian assembly, not with the views of  answering the accusations brought against them by the cities, but they  wanted to put before the Lacedaemonians the whole question, and make  them understand that they should take time to deliberate and not be  rash. They desired also to set forth the greatness of their city,  reminding the elder men of what they knew, and informing the younger  of what lay beyond their experience. They thought that their words  would sway the Lacedaemonians in the direction of peace. So they came  and said that, if they might be allowed, they too would like to  address the people. The Lacedaemonians invited them to come forward,  and they spoke as follows:    \"We were not sent here to argue with your allies, but on a special  mission; observing, however, that no small outcry has arisen against  us, we have come forward, not to answer the accusations which they  bring (for you are not judges before whom either we or they have to  plead), but to prevent you from lending too ready an ear to their bad  advice and so deciding wrongly about a very serious question. We  propose also, in reply to the wider charges which are raised against  us, to show that what we have acquired we hold rightfully.    \"Of the ancient deeds handed down by tradition and which no eye of any  one who hears us ever saw, why should we speak? But of the Persian  war, and other events which you yourselves remember, speak we must,  altho we have brought them forward so often that the repetition of  them is disagreeable to us. When we faced those perils we did so for  the common benefit; in the solid good you shared, and of the glory,  whatever good there may be in that, we would not be wholly deprived.  Our words are not designed to deprecate hostility, but to set forth in  evidence the character of the city with which, unless you are very  careful, you will soon be involved in war. We tell you that we, first  and alone, dared to engage with the barbarian at Marathon,[23] and  that, when he came again, being too weak to defend ourselves by land,  we and our whole people embarked on shipboard and shared with the  other Hellenes in the victory of Salamis.[24] Thereby he was prevented  from sailing to the Peloponnesus and ravaging city after city; for  against so mighty a fleet how could you have helped one another? He  himself is the best witness of our words; for when he was once  defeated at sea, he felt that his power was gone and quickly retreated  with the greater part of his army.    \"The event proved undeniably that the fate of Hellas depended on her  navy. And the three chief elements of success were contributed by us;  namely, the greatest number of ships, the ablest general, the most  devoted patriotism. The ships in all numbered four hundred, and of  these, our own contingent amounted to nearly two-thirds. To the  influence of Themistocles, our general, it was chiefly due that we  fought in the strait, which was confessedly our salvation; and for  this service you yourselves honored him above any stranger who ever  visited you. Thirdly, we displayed the most extraordinary courage and  devotion; there was no one to help us by land; for up to our frontier  those who lay in the enemy's path were already slaves; so we  determined to leave our city and sacrifice our homes. Even in that  extremity we did not choose to desert the cause of the allies who  still resisted, and by dispersing ourselves to become useless to them;  but we embarked and fought, taking no offense at your failure to  assist us sooner. We maintain then that we rendered you a service at  least as great as you rendered us. The cities from which you came to  help us were still inhabited and you might hope to return to them;  your concern was for yourselves and not for us; at any rate, you  remained at a distance while we had anything to lose. But we went  forth from a city which was no more, and fought for one of which there  was small hope; and yet we saved ourselves, and bore our part in  saving you. If, in order to preserve our land, like other states, we  had gone over to the Persians at first, or afterward had not ventured  to embark because our ruin was already complete, it would have been  useless for you with your weak navy to fight at sea, but everything  would have gone quietly just as the Persian desired.    \"Considering, Lacedaemonians, the energy and sagacity which we then  displayed, do we deserve to be so bitterly hated by the other Hellenes  merely because we have an empire? That empire was not acquired by  force; but you would not stay and make an end of the barbarian, and  the allies came of their own accord and asked us to be their leaders.  The subsequent development of our power was originally forced upon us  by circumstances; fear was our first motive; afterward ambition, and  then interest stept in. And when we had incurred the hatred of most of  our allies, when some of them had already revolted and been  subjugated, and you were no longer the friends to us which you once  had been, but suspicious and ill-disposed, how could we without great  risk relax our hold? For the cities as fast as they fell away from us  would have gone over to you. And no man is to be reproached who seizes  every possible advantage when the danger is so great.    \"At all events, Lacedaemonians, we may retort that you, in the exercise  of your supremacy, manage the cities of Peloponnesus to suit your own  views, and that if you, and not we, had persevered in the command of  the allies long enough to be hated, you would have been quite as  intolerable to them as we are, and would have been compelled, for the  sake of your own safety, to rule with a strong hand. An empire was  offered to us: can you wonder that, acting as human nature always  will, we accepted it, and refused to give it up again, constrained by  three all powerful motives, ambition, fear, interest? We are not the  first who have aspired to rule; the world has ever held that the  weaker must be kept down by the stronger. And we think that we are  worthy of power; and there was a time when you thought so too; but now  when you mean expediency you talk about justice. Did justice ever  deter any one from taking by force whatever he could? Men who indulge  the natural ambition of empire deserve credit if they are in any  degree more careful of justice than they need be. How moderate we are  would speedily appear if others took our place; indeed, our very  moderation, which should be our glory, has been unjustly converted  into a reproach.    \"For because in our suits with our allies, regulated by treaty, we do  not even stand upon our rights, but have instituted the practise of  deciding them at Athens and by Athenian law, we are supposed to be  litigious. None of our opponents observes why others, who exercise  dominion elsewhere and are less moderate than we are in their dealings  with their subjects, escape this reproach. Why is it? Because men who  practise violence have no longer any need of law. But we are in the  habit of meeting our allies on terms of equality, and, therefore, if  through some legal decision of ours, or exercise of our imperial  power, contrary to their own ideas of right, they suffer ever so  little, they are not grateful for our moderation in leaving them so  much, but are far more offended at their trifling loss than if we had  from the first plundered them in the face of day, laying aside all  thought of law. For then they would themselves have admitted that the  weaker must give way to the stronger. Mankind resents injustice more  than violence, because the one seems to be an unfair advantage taken  by an equal, the other is the irresistible force of a superior. They  were patient under the yoke of the Persian, who inflicted on them far  more grievous wrongs; but now our dominion is odious in their eyes.  And no wonder: the ruler of the day is always detested by his  subjects. And should your empire supplant ours, may not you lose the  good-will which you owe to the fear of us? Lose it you certainly will,  if you mean again to exhibit the temper of which you gave a specimen  when, for a short time, you led the confederacy against the Persian.  For the institutions under which you live are incompatible with those  of foreign states; and further, when any of you goes abroad, he  respects neither these nor any other Hellenic laws.    \"Do not then be hasty in deciding a question which is serious; and do  not, by listening to the misrepresentations and complaints of others,  bring trouble upon yourselves. Realize, while there is time, the  inscrutable nature of war; and how when protracted it generally ends  in becoming a mere matter of chance, over which neither of us can have  any control, the event being equally unknown and equally hazardous to  both.

There was no truth in the accusations except in so far as it regarded  Vasco Nunez's attachment to his Indian wife, and indeed Balboa had  never given any public refusal to abide by the marital engagement which  he had entered into; but there was just enough probability in  Garavito's tale to carry conviction to the ferocious tyrant.  He  instantly determined upon Balboa's death.  Detaining his envoys, he  sent him a very courteous and affectionate letter, entreating him to  come to Ada to receive some further instructions before he set forth on  the South Sea.    Among the many friends of Balboa was the notary Arguello who had  embarked his fortune in the projected expedition.  He prepared a  warning to Vasco Nunez, which unfortunately fell into the hands of  Pedrarias and resulted in his being clapped into prison with the rest.  Balboa unsuspiciously complied with the governor's request, and,  attended by a small escort, immediately set forth for Ada.    He was arrested on the way by a company of soldiers headed by Francisco  Pizarro, who had nothing to do with the subsequent transactions, and  simply acted under orders, as any other soldier would have done.  Balboa was thrown into prison and heavily ironed; he was tried for  treason against the King and Pedrarias.  The testimony of the soldier  who had listened in the rainstorm was brought forward, and, in spite of  a noble defense, Balboa was declared guilty.    Espinosa, who was his judge, was so dissatisfied with the verdict,  however, that he personally besought Pedrarias to mitigate the  sentence.  The stern old tyrant refused to interfere, nor would he  entertain {49} Balboa's appeal to Spain.  \"He has sinned,\" he said  tersely; \"death to him!\"  Four of his companions--three of them men who  had been imprisoned at Ada, and the notary who had endeavored to warn  him--were sentenced to death.    It was evening before the preparations for the execution were  completed.  Balboa faced death as dauntlessly as he had faced life.  Pedrarias was hated in Ada and Darien; Balboa was loved.  If the  veterans of Antigua had not been on the other side of the Isthmus,  Balboa would have been rescued.  As it was, the troops of Pedrarias  awed the people of Ada and the judicial murder went forward.    Balboa was as composed when he mounted the scaffold as he had been when  he welcomed Pedrarias.  A proclamation was made that he was a traitor,  and with his last breath he denied this and asserted his innocence.  When the axe fell that severed his head, the noblest Spaniard of the  time, and one who ranks with those of any time, was judicially  murdered.  One after the other, the three companions, equally as  dauntless, suffered the unjust penalty.  The fourth execution had taken  place in the swift twilight of the tropical latitude and the darkness  was already closing down upon the town when the last man mounted the  scaffold.  This was the notary, Arguello, who had interfered to save  Balboa.  He seems to have been beloved by the inhabitants of the town,  for they awakened from their horror, and some of consideration among  them appealed personally to Pedrarias, who had watched the execution  from a latticed window, to reprieve the last victim.  \"He shall die,\"  said the governor sternly, \"if I have to kill him with my own hand.\"    So, to the future sorrow of America, and to the {50} great diminution  of the glory and peace of Spain, and the world, passed to his death the  gallant, the dauntless, the noble-hearted Balboa.  Pedrarias lived  until his eighty-ninth year, and died in his bed at Panama; which town  had been first visited by one of his captains, Tello de Guzman, founded  by Espinosa and upbuilt by himself.    There are times when a belief in an old-fashioned Calvinistic hell of  fire and brimstone is an extremely comforting doctrine, irrespective of  theological bias.  Else how should we dispose of Nero, Tiberius,  Torquemada, and gentlemen of their stripe?  Wherever such a company may  be congregated, Pedro Arias de Avila is entitled to a high and  exclusive place.        [1] In the English chronicles he is often spoken of as Davila, which is  near enough to Diabolo to make one wish that the latter sobriquet had  been his own.  It would have been much more apposite.    [2] It was Magellan who gave it the inappropriate name of \"Pacific.\"    [3] To-day not one foot of territory bordering on that sea belongs to  Spain.

The Chief Scion of a Famous Family    The reader will look in vain on the map of modern Spain for the ancient  province of Estremadura, yet it is a spot which, in that it was the  birthplace of the conquerors of Peru and Mexico--to say nothing of the  discoverer of the Mississippi--contributed more to the glory of Spain  than any other province in the Iberian peninsula.  In 1883, the ancient  territory was divided into the two present existing states of Badajoz  and Caceres.  In the latter of these lies the important mountain town  of Trujillo.    Living there in the last half of the fifteenth century was an obscure  personage named Gonzalo Pizarro.  He was a gentleman whose lineage was  ancient, whose circumstances were narrow and whose morals were loose.  By profession he was a soldier who had gained some experience in the  wars under the \"Great Captain,\" Gonsalvo de Cordova.  History would  take no note of this vagrom and obscure cavalier had it not been for  his children.  Four sons there were whose qualities and opportunities  were such as to have enabled them to play a somewhat large part in the  world's affairs {54} in their day.  How many unconsidered other  progeny, male or female, there may have been, God alone  knows--possibly, nay probably, a goodly number.    The eldest son was named Francisco.  His mother, who was not married to  his father--indeed not married to anybody at any time so far as I can  find out--was a peasant woman named Francisca Gonzales.  Francisco was  born about the year 1471.  His advent was not of sufficient importance  to have been recorded, apparently, and the exact date of his  terrestrial appearance is a matter of conjecture, with the guesses  ranging between 1470 and 1478.  A few years after the arrival of  Francisco, there was born to Gonzales, and this time by his lawful  wife, name unknown, a second son, Hernando.  By the woman Gonzales, a  score of years later, this promiscuous father had two more illegitimate  sons, one of whom he named Gonzalo after himself, and the third he  called Juan.  Francisca Gonzales also bore a fourth son, of whom  Gonzalo Pizarro was not the father, who was known as Martin de  Alcantara.  Thus Hernando, the second, was legitimate; Gonzalo and Juan  were his illegitimate half-brethren, having the same father but a  different mother; while Alcantara was a uterine brother to the three  illegitimate Pizarros, having the same mother but a different father.  There must have been marvelous qualities in the original Pizarro, for  such a family is rarely to be met with in history.    Such a mixed state of affairs was not so shocking in those days as it  would be at present.  I do not find that anybody cast any stones at the  Pizarros on account of these irregularities in their birth.  In fact,  they had plenty of companions in their anomalous social relations, and  it is a speaking commentary on the {55} times that nobody seemed to  consider it as especially disgraceful or even very remarkable.    Hernando, the second son, received a good education for the day.  The  others were thrown mainly on their own resources.  Legend says that  Francisco was suckled by a sow.  The statement may be dismissed as a  fable, but it is more than probable that the assertion that he was a  swineherd is correct.  It is certain that to the day of his death he  could neither read nor write.  He never even learned to sign his own  name, yet he was a man of qualities who made a great figure in history  in spite of these disabilities, leaving behind him an immortal if  unenviable name.  His career was humble and obscure to the vanishing  point for forty years, of which practically nothing is known.  It is  alleged that he made a campaign in Italy with his father, but this is  doubtful.  A father who left him to tend the swine, who did nothing for  his education, would not have bothered to take him a-soldiering.    We leave the field of conjecture, however, and meet him in far-off  America in 1510 as an officer under Alonzo de Ojeda--that Don Quixote  among discoverers.  His qualities had obtained for him some preferment,  for when Ojeda left the miserable remnants of his colony at San  Sebastian on the Gulf of Darien, and returned to Cuba for help, Pizarro  was put in charge, with instructions to wait a certain time, and if  succour did not reach him to leave.  He waited the required time,  indeed waited longer, until enough people died to enable the brigantine  that had been left with them to carry the survivors, and then sailed  away.  He was a member of Encisco's expedition to Darien, in which he  fell in with the youthful and {56} romantic Vasco Nunez de Balboa.  With Balboa he marched across the Isthmus, and was the second white man  to look upon the Great South Sea in 1513.  Subsequently, he was an  officer under that American Nero, Pedro Arias de Avila, commonly called  Pedrarias, the founder and Governor of Panama, the conqueror of  Nicaragua and parts adjacent.  Oviedo says that between his seventieth  year, which was his age when he came to America, and his eighty-sixth  year, when he died, the infamous Pedrarias caused more than two million  Indians to"]]]
