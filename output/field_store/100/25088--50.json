They were smiling, and looking amiability itself.    \"We thought, as you've got a piano in your room,\" began Lilias Ashby,  \"that we might as well come and join you, if you don't mind. Janie's got  a book of songs with her.\"    \"Oh, by all means, of course!\" replied VA. politely and unanimously.  \"We're just having a sort of concert, you know.\"    \"Sure you don't mind?\"    \"Not a bit of it!\"    \"Right-o! Run and tell Janie then, Susie, and ask her to bring the  others.\"    An invasion from the Sixth was indeed an unwonted honor, which probably  nothing short of a piano would have accomplished. The hostesses,  somewhat overwhelmed, seated the distinguished guests to the best of  their ability in the rather limited accommodation, and hospitably passed  round their few remaining pieces of chocolate.    \"We'll leave the door open, please,\" said Lispeth, \"because I promised  Miss Burd not to let those intermediates get too outrageous, and I have  to listen out for them.\"    Janie Potter, with her book of songs, was pushed forward, and began to  entertain the company with popular selections of the day, to which they  chanted the choruses. She had a good clear voice, and the audience  joined with enthusiasm in the various ditties.    The clapping which followed was continued down the landing, and, through  the open door, peered the interested faces of most of the members of  VB. who had come to share the fun.    \"May we butt in?\" they asked hopefully.    \"Not a square inch of room for you,\" answered Lispeth, \"but you may  squat in the corridor outside if you like. Anybody who performs can join  the show, but that's all. I'll tell you when it's your turn. It's  VA. next. Now then,\" (turning to the hostesses), \"who else can  do anything? Francie Hall, come along at once!\"    \"I can't! I can't!\" objected Francie. \"So it's no use asking me; it  isn't indeed! I'll tell you what--Bess Haselford plays the violin, and,  what's more, she's got it with her, for I saw her put it away in the  dressing-room.\"    \"O-O-Oh! It was my lesson with Signor Chianti this afternoon, that's why  I had to bring it!\" said Bess, turning red.    \"Go and fetch it, Francie!\" ordered Lispeth. \"You know where it is.\"    Francie returned in a short time, and handed the neat leather case to  its owner. Bess, looking flustered and nervous, drew out the violin, and  began to tune it.    \"I've brought your music too!\" said Francie, triumphantly opening a  folio, \"so you've no excuse for saying you can't remember anything.  Who'll play your accompaniment? Here, Ingred!\"    \"Oh! somebody else would do it far better,\" protested Ingred.  \"Janie----\"    \"I'm no reader.\"    \"Lilas?\"    \"Couldn't to save my life!\"    \"Go ahead, Ingred, and don't waste time!\" said Lispeth firmly.    Ingred sat down to the piano without a smile. Her schoolmates took her  unwillingness for modesty, but in her heart of hearts her main thought  was: \"Why should _I_ help this new girl to show off?\" She would have  played accompaniments gladly for anybody else, but she considered that  Bess had already received quite enough attention in one afternoon. For  her own credit, however, she must do her best, so she concentrated her  energies on the prelude. When the first strains of the violin joined in,  her musical ear recognized immediately that Bess's playing was of a very  high quality. The tone was pure, the notes were perfectly in tune, and  there was a ringing sweetness, a crisp power of expression, and a  haunting pathos in the rendering of the melody that showed the performer  to be capable of interpreting the composer's meaning. In spite of her  disinclination, Ingred warmed to the accompaniment. When the violin  seemed to be bringing out laughter and tears, the piano must do its  part, and not merely supply a succession of unimpassioned chords. Ingred  was a good reader for a girl of fifteen, but she surpassed herself on  this occasion, and seemed to accomplish the difficult passages almost by  instinct. She played the final notes very softly as the last fairy  strains of the melody thrilled slowly away.    There was a second of silence, then the girls, inside and outside the  room, clapped their loudest.    \"It was capital!\" declared Lispeth encouragingly. \"Bess, we shall want  you again for school concerts. You and Ingred ought to practise  together. Let me look at your violin. I wish _I_ could play like that!\"    \"Thanks ever so much!\" murmured Bess to Ingred, as the latter got up  from the piano.    \"Oh! it's all right!\" replied Ingred airily, moving away in a hurry to  the other side of the room. She did not want Bess to take up Lispeth's  no doubt well meant but rather embarrassing suggestion that they should  practise together, and was quite ready with an excuse if it should be  proposed.    \"It's the turn of the Sixth now,\" she jodelled.    \"VB. haven't done anything yet; I'll call one of them in,\" said  Lispeth, stepping out to the landing.    Once through the door, however, her ears were assailed by such an  absolute din proceeding from the farther end of the corridor, that she  dropped her character of impresario for the duties of head-girl, and  calling two of her fellow prefects, went to investigate the cause of the  disturbance. She returned in a short time, looking flushed and flurried.    \"It's those wretched kids in IVB.,\" she proclaimed. \"They were  behaving disgracefully, pelting each other with the remains of their  buns, and fencing with rulers. And they actually had the cheek to tell  me they weren't making any more noise than we were with our singing and  playing! I sent them home at once, and I think we'd all better go too.  Those intermediates always overstep the line if they've an atom of a  chance. I told them what I thought about them. It's been quite a ripping  concert, and I'm sorry to break it up, but you understand, don't you?\"    \"Rather!\" replied the others, as they began their exodus into the  corridor.          CHAPTER VI    The School Parliament      During the excitement of the concert Ingred had hardly time to realize  the greatness of the honor thrust upon her in being chosen as warden to  represent her form. All it stood for struck her afterwards.    \"My word! You'll have to sit up and behave yourself after this, Madame!\"  remarked Quenrede, when she mentioned the matter at home.    \"Yes, of course they'll all look to you now as an example!\" added  Mother.    \"Oh, I don't think they will!\" declared Ingred, who had not considered  her new office from that point of view. \"I've just to speak up for the  interests of the form, you know.\"    \"There are obligations as well as interests,\" said Mother seriously.  \"Try to make VA. a useful factor in the school. That would be something  worth doing, wouldn't it?\"    In arranging for the School Parliament, Miss Burd had allowed wardens to  be chosen by each form, from IIIB. upwards, but had decided that the  smaller girls were too young to take part in public affairs. Every form  that sent a representative constituted itself into a kind of club, and  chose a special name. These were placed on the Council Register as  follows:        VI.   The True Blues.      VA.   The Pioneers.      VB.   The Amazons.      IVA.  The Old Brigade.      IVB.  The Mermaids.      IIIA. The Dragonflies.      IIIB. The Cuckoos.    \"You can compare marks every fortnight,\" said Miss Burd, \"and whichever  gets the best average shall hold a cup that I intend to present. The  marks of the whole form will count, so that slackers will be a distinct  drawback to their own companies. Any girl who loses a mark hinders her  form from gaining the cup, and of course vice versa, those who work will  help.\"    The question of marks had been a much debated subject with Miss Burd.  She had discussed it in detail at several educational conferences, and  had come to the conclusion that, on the whole, the system was highly  desirable.    \"It's all very well to talk about the evils of emulation, and work for  work's sake,\" she confided to Miss Strong, \"but you can't get children  to see things altogether in the same light as grown-ups. I own that,  when I was a child myself, I made tremendous efforts so that I might be  head of my form, and when the arrangements were changed at our school,  and, instead of carefully-registered marks and places, we only had  first, second, or third class, I slacked off considerably. I knew that a  lesson not quite so perfectly learnt, or an exercise with one or two  mistakes, would still find me in the First Class, so why should I make  such enormous exertions? When every slip might mean the loss of my  chance to be top, I was far more careful. Of course I know that  Emulation, with a big E, is supposed to be all wrong, but really I think  people make too much fuss about it. It was quite friendly rivalry when I  was at school, and the girls with whom I competed were my dearest chums.  I believe my new system here is going to unite both methods. Every girl  will work for herself, but her marks will also count for her form, and  if she slacks, and so pulls down the standard, I hope her companions  will give her as bad a time as they do to a 'butter-fingers' at cricket,  and that's saying something!\"    The idea of each form constituting a club appealed to the school. It was  far more interesting to be \"Amazons\" or \"Cuckoos\" than merely  VB. or IIIB., and as awards were to be according to averages, it was  thrilling to feel that girls of twelve could wrest away the silver cup  from the hands of the very prefects themselves.    \"It makes it just like playing a game!\" declared Ida Brooke.    \"Yes, a sort of tug-of-war when everybody's got to pull, and mustn't let  go!\" added Cissie Barnes, \"Do you remember playing 'Oranges and Lemons'  once with the Sixth? _We_ all held on to each others' waists like grim  death, and Janie Potter gave"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#9)"],[1," as the smallest and most insignificant of these will rob  her of sleep and make the night most uncomfortable. When the space is  smooth mark the spot where the shoulders rest when lying down and  another spot immediately under the hips, then dig a hollow for each to  fit in easily; cover the sleeping space with poncho, rubber side down,  and over this lay a folded blanket for a mattress, using the second  blanket as a cover. Your sleep will then probably be sound and  refreshing.      =Guards=    Establish watchers, for this temporary camp, in relays to keep guard  through the night and care for the fire, not allowing it to spread, grow  too hot, or die down and go out.    If there are eight in the party, the first two, starting in at 10 P. M.,  will keep vigil until 12 midnight. These may chance to see a porcupine  or other small wild animal, but the little creatures will not come too  near as long as your camp-fire is burning. The next two watchers will be  on duty until 2 A. M., and will doubtless hear, if not see, some of the  wild life of the forest. The third couple's turn lasts until 4 A. M.;  then the last two will be awakened in time to see the sun rise, listen  to the twittering and singing of the wild birds, and possibly catch a  glimpse of wild deer. With 6 A. M. comes broad daylight, and the  ever-to-be-remembered night in the open is past and gone.    These side trips bring you into closer touch with nature, quicken your  love for, and a desire to know more of, the wild; and, much to the  delight of the campers keeping guard through the hours of the night,  there comes a keen sense of the unusual, of novel experience, of  strangeness and adventure.    [Illustration: Soft wood.]      =Exercise=    While wholesome camping calls for sufficient physical exercise to cause  a girl to be blissfully tired at night, and yet awaken refreshed and  full of energy the next morning with a good appetite for breakfast,  until you become accustomed to the outdoor life, it is best to curb your  ambition to outdo the other girls in strength and endurance. It is best  not to overtax yourself by travelling too far on a long trail at one  stretch, or by lifting too heavy a log, stone, or other weight.      =The Camp-Fire=    The outdoor fire in camp bespeaks cheer, comfort, and possibilities for  a hot dinner, all of which the camper appreciates.      =How to Build a Fire=    Choose an open space, if possible, for your fire. Beware of having it  under tree branches, too near a tent, or in any other place that might  prove dangerous. Start your fire with the tinder nearest at hand, dry  leaves, ferns, twigs, cones, birch bark, or pine-knot slivers. As the  tinder begins to burn, add kindling-wood of larger size, always  remembering that the air must circulate under and upward through the  kindling; no fire can live without air any more than you can live  without breathing. Smother a person and he will die, smother a fire and  it will die.    [Illustration: Hard wood.]    Soft woods are best to use after lighting the tinder; they ignite easily  and burn quickly, such as pine, spruce, alder, birch, soft maple,  balsam-fir, and others. When the kindling is blazing put on still  heavier wood, until you have a good, steady fire. Hard wood is better  than soft when the fire is well going; it burns longer and can usually  be depended upon for a reliable fire, not sending out sparks or  sputtering, as do many of the soft woods, but burning well and giving a  fine bed of hot coals. The tree belonging exclusively to America, and  which is the best of the hardwoods, comes first on the hardwood list.  This is _hickory_. Pecan, chestnut-oak, black birch, basket-oaks, white  birch, maple, dogwood, beech, red and yellow birch, ash, and apple wood  when obtainable are excellent.      =Cook-Fire=    Make the cook-fire _small_ and _hot_; then you can work over it in  comfort and not scorch both hands and face when trying to get near  enough to cook, as would be the case if the fire were large.    When in a hurry use dry bark as wood for the cook-fire. Hemlock, pine,  hickory, and other bark make a hot fire in a short time, and water will  boil quickly over a bark fire.      =Log-Cabin Fire=    Start this fire with two good-sized short sticks or logs. Place them  about one foot apart parallel to each other. At each end across these  lay two smaller sticks, and in the hollow square formed by the four  sticks, put the tinder of cones, birch bark, or dry leaves.    Across the two upper sticks and over the tinder, make a grate by laying  slender kindling sticks across from and resting on top of the two upper  large sticks. Over the grate, at right angles to the sticks forming it,  place more sticks of larger size. Continue in this way, building the  log-cabin fire until the structure is one foot or so high, each layer  being placed at right angles to the one beneath it. The fire must be  lighted from beneath in the pile of tinder. I learned this method when  on the Pacific slope. The fire burns quickly, and the log-cabin plan is  a good one to follow when heating the bean hole, as the fire can be  built over the hole, and in burning the red-hot coals will fall down  into it, or the fire can be built directly in the hole; both ways are  used by campers.      =Fire in the Rain=    To build a fire in the rain with no dry wood in sight seems a difficult  problem, but keep cheerful, hum your favorite tune, and look for a  pine-knot or birch bark and an old dead stump or log. In the centre of  the dead wood you will find dry wood; dig it out and, after starting the  fire with either birch bark or pine-knot, use the dry wood as kindling.  When it begins to burn, add larger pieces of wood, and soon the fire  will grow strong enough to burn wet wood. If there happens to be a big  rock in your camp, build your fire on the sheltered side and directly  against the stone, which will act as a windbreak and keep the driving  rain from extinguishing the fire. A slightly shelving bank would also  form a shelter for it. A pine-knot is always a good friend to the girl  camper, both in dry and wet weather, but is especially friendly when it  rains and everything is dripping wet.    You will find pine-knots in wooded sections where pine-trees grow; or,  if you are located near water where there are no trees, look for  pine-knots in driftwood washed ashore. When secured cut thin slices down  part way all around the elongated knot and circle it with many layers of  shavings until the knot somewhat resembles a toy tree. The inside will  be absolutely dry, and this branching knot will prove reliable and start  your fire without fail. Birch bark will start a fire even when the bark  is damp, and it is one of the best things you can have as a starter for  an outdoor, rainy-day fire.    Take your cue from the forest guides, and while in the woods always  carry some dry birch bark in your pocket for a fire in case of rain.      =Camp Fireplace=    One way to make the outdoor fireplace is to lay two _green_ logs side by  side on the ground in a narrow V shape, but open at both ends; only a  few inches at one end, a foot or more at the other. The fire is built  between the logs, and the frying-pan and pail of water, resting on both  logs, bridge across the fire. Should the widest space between the logs  be needed, place two slender green logs at right angles across the V  logs, and have these short top cross logs near enough together to hold  the frying-pans set on them (Fig. 26).    When there are no green logs, build the fireplace with three rectangular  sides of stone, open front, and make the fire in the centre; the pots  and pans rest across the fire on the stones.    If neither stones nor logs are available, dig a circle of fresh earth as  a safeguard and have the fire in its centre. Here you will need two  strong, forked-top stakes driven down into the ground directly opposite  each other, one on each side of the circle. Rest the end of a stout  green stick in the forked tops of the stakes, and use it to hang pots  and pails from when cooking. A fire can also be safeguarded with a  circle of stones placed close together. Another method of outdoor  cooking may be seen on page 81, where leaning stakes are used from which  to hang cooking utensils over the fire.    One more caution about possibilities of causing forest fire. Terrible  wide-spread fires have resulted from what was supposed to be an  extinguished outdoor fire. Do not trust it, but when you are sure the  camp-fire is out, pour on more water over the fire and all around the  unburned edge of surrounding ground; then throw on fresh earth until the  fire space is covered. Be always on the safe side. Tack up on a tree  in the camp, where all must see it, a copy of the state laws regarding  forest fires, as shown in photograph frontispiece.    [Illustration: Bringing wood for the fire.]    On forest lands much of the ground is deep with tangled rootlets and  fibres mixed in with the mould, and a fire may be smouldering down  underneath, where you cannot see it. _Have a care._    The permanent-camp fireplace, built to do service for several seasons,  is usually of big, heavy, _green_ logs, stones, and earth. The logs,  about three and one-half feet long, are built log-cabin fashion, some  twenty-eight inches high, with all crevices filled in and firmly padded  with earth and stones. Big stones are anchored securely along the top of  the earth-covered log sides and back of the fireplace, raising these  higher than the front. The space inside the walled fireplace is very  nearly filled up with earth, and the fire is built on this earth.  Surfaces of logs which may have been left exposed where the fire is to  be made are safeguarded with earth (Fig. 27).    Such a fireplace is big, substantial, firm, and lasting. Many of them  may be seen in the Adirondacks. They usually face the camp shelter, but  are located "]]]
