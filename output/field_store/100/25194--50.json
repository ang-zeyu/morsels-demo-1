The earliest of their sections lie within the legendary  period, and though in the third dynasty preserved we begin to note signs  of a firmer historical tradition, the great break that then occurs in  the text is at present only bridged by titles of various \"kingdoms\"  which the summaries give; a few even of these are missing and the  relative order of the rest is not assured. But in spite of their  imperfect state of preservation, these documents are of great historical  value and will furnish a framework for future chronological schemes.  Meanwhile we may attribute to some of the later dynasties titles in  complete agreement with Sumerian tradition. The dynasty of Ur-Engur, for  example, which preceded that of Nisin, becomes, if we like, the Third  Dynasty of Ur. Another important fact which strikes us after a scrutiny  of the early royal names recovered is that, while two or three are  Semitic,(2) the great majority of those borne by the earliest rulers of  Kish, Erech, and Ur are as obviously Sumerian.         (1) See Poebel, _Historical Texts_, pp. 73 ff. and       _Historical and Grammatical Texts_, pl. ii-iv, Nos. 2-5. The       best preserved of the lists is No. 2; Nos. 3 and 4 are       comparatively small fragments; and of No. 5 the obverse only       is here published for the first time, the contents of the       reverse having been made known some years ago by Hilprecht       (cf. _Mathematical, Metrological, and Chronological       Tablets_, p. 46 f., pl. 30, No. 47). The fragments belong to       separate copies of the Sumerian dynastic record, and it       happens that the extant portions of their text in some       places cover the same period and are duplicates of one       another.         (2) Cf., e.g., two of the earliest kings of Kish, Galumum       and Zugagib. The former is probably the Semitic-Babylonian       word _kalumum_, \"young animal, lamb,\" the latter       _zukakibum_, \"scorpion\"; cf. Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, p. 111.       The occurrence of these names points to Semitic infiltration       into Northern Babylonia since the dawn of history, a state       of things we should naturally expect. It is improbable that       on this point Sumerian tradition should have merely       reflected the conditions of a later period.    It is clear that in native tradition, current among the Sumerians  themselves before the close of the third millennium, their race was  regarded as in possession of Babylonia since the dawn of history. This  at any rate proves that their advent was not sudden nor comparatively  recent, and it further suggests that Babylonia itself was the cradle  of their civilization. It will be the province of future archaeological  research to fill out the missing dynasties and to determine at what  points in the list their strictly historical basis disappears. Some,  which are fortunately preserved near the beginning, bear on their face  their legendary character. But for our purpose they are none the worse  for that.    In the first two dynasties, which had their seats at the cities of Kish  and Erech, we see gods mingling with men upon the earth. Tammuz, the god  of vegetation, for whose annual death Ezekiel saw women weeping beside  the Temple at Jerusalem, is here an earthly monarch. He appears to be  described as \"a hunter\", a phrase which recalls the death of Adonis in  Greek mythology. According to our Sumerian text he reigned in Erech for  a hundred years.    Another attractive Babylonian legend is that of Etana, the prototype of  Icarus and hero of the earliest dream of human flight.(1) Clinging  to the pinions of his friend the Eagle he beheld the world and its  encircling stream recede beneath him; and he flew through the gate of  heaven, only to fall headlong back to earth. He is here duly entered  in the list, where we read that \"Etana, the shepherd who ascended to  heaven, who subdued all lands\", ruled in the city of Kish for 635 years.         (1) The Egyptian conception of the deceased Pharaoh       ascending to heaven as a falcon and becoming merged into the       sun, which first occurs in the Pyramid texts (see Gardiner       in Cumont's _Etudes Syriennes_, pp. 109 ff.), belongs to a       different range of ideas. But it may well have been combined       with the Etana tradition to produce the funerary eagle       employed so commonly in Roman Syria in representations of       the emperor's apotheosis (cf. Cumont, op. cit., pp. 37 ff.,       115).    The god Lugal-banda is another hero of legend. When the hearts of the  other gods failed them, he alone recovered the Tablets of Fate, stolen  by the bird-god Zu from Enlil's palace. He is here recorded to have  reigned in Erech for 1,200 years.    Tradition already told us that Erech was the native city of Gilgamesh,  the hero of the national epic, to whom his ancestor Ut-napishtim related  the story of the Flood. Gilgamesh too is in our list, as king of Erech  for 126 years.    We have here in fact recovered traditions of Post-diluvian kings.  Unfortunately our list goes no farther back than that, but it is  probable that in its original form it presented a general correspondence  to the system preserved from Berossus, which enumerates ten Antediluvian  kings, the last of them Xisuthros, the hero of the Deluge. Indeed, for  the dynastic period, the agreement of these old Sumerian lists with the  chronological system of Berossus is striking. The latter, according to  Syncellus, gives 34,090 or 34,080 years as the total duration of the  historical period, apart from his preceding mythical ages, while the  figure as preserved by Eusebius is 33,091 years.(1) The compiler of one  of our new lists,(2) writing some 1,900 years earlier, reckons that the  dynastic period in his day had lasted for 32,243 years. Of course all  these figures are mythical, and even at the time of the Sumerian Dynasty  of Nisin variant traditions were current with regard to the number of  historical and semi-mythical kings of Babylonia and the duration of  their rule. For the earlier writer of another of our lists,(3) separated  from the one already quoted by an interval of only sixty-seven years,  gives 28,876(4) years as the total duration of the dynasties at his  time. But in spite of these discrepancies, the general resemblance  presented by the huge totals in the variant copies of the list to the  alternative figures of Berossus, if we ignore his mythical period,  is remarkable. They indicate a far closer correspondence of the Greek  tradition with that of the early Sumerians themselves than was formerly  suspected.         (1) The figure 34,090 is that given by Syncellus (ed.       Dindorf, p. 147); but it is 34,080 in the equivalent which       is added in \"sars\", &c. The discrepancy is explained by some       as due to an intentional omission of the units in the second       reckoning; others would regard 34,080 as the correct figure       (cf. _Hist. of Bab._, p. 114 f.). The reading of ninety       against eighty is supported by the 33,091 of Eusebius       (_Chron. lib. pri._, ed. Schoene, col. 25).         (2) No. 4.         (3) No. 2.         (4) The figures are broken, but the reading given may be       accepted with some confidence; see Poebel, _Hist. Inscr._,       p. 103.    Further proof of this correspondence may be seen in the fact that the  new Sumerian Version of the Deluge Story, which I propose to discuss in  the second lecture, gives us a connected account of the world's history  down to that point. The Deluge hero is there a Sumerian king named  Ziusudu, ruling in one of the newly created cities of Babylonia and  ministering at the shrine of his city-god. He is continually given the  royal title, and the foundation of the Babylonian \"kingdom\" is treated  as an essential part of Creation. We may therefore assume that an  Antediluvian period existed in Sumerian tradition as in Berossus.(1) And  I think Dr. Poebel is right in assuming that the Nippur copies of the  Dynastic List begin with the Post-diluvian period.(2)         (1) Of course it does not necessarily follow that the figure       assigned to the duration of the Antediluvian or mythical       period by the Sumerians would show so close a resemblance to       that of Berossus as we have already noted in their estimates       of the dynastic or historical period. But there is no need       to assume that Berossus' huge total of a hundred and twenty       \"sars\" (432,000 years) is entirely a product of Neo-       Babylonian speculation; the total 432,000 is explained as       representing ten months of a cosmic year, each month       consisting of twelve \"sars\", i.e. 12 x 3600 = 43,200 years.       The Sumerians themselves had no difficulty in picturing two       of their dynastic rulers as each reigning for two \"ners\"       (1,200 years), and it would not be unlikely that \"sars\" were       distributed among still earlier rulers; the numbers were       easily written. For the unequal distribution of his hundred       and twenty \"sars\" by Berossus among his ten Antediluvian       kings, see Appendix II.         (2) The exclusion of the Antediluvian period from the list       may perhaps be explained on the assumption that its compiler       confined his record to \"kingdoms\", and that the mythical       rulers who preceded them did not form a \"kingdom\" within his       definition of the term. In any case we have a clear       indication that an earlier period was included before the       true \"kingdoms\", or dynasties, in an Assyrian copy of the       list, a fragment of which is preserved in the British Museum       from the Library of Ashur-bani-pal at Nineveh; see _Chron.       conc.

(#9)"],[1,"Yorkist proscription, but too far off to unite in his favour  Lancastrian support. He owed his elevation to the mistakes of his  enemies and to the cool, calculating craft which enabled him to use  those mistakes without making mistakes of his own. He ran the great  risk of his life in his invasion of England, but henceforth he left  nothing to chance. He was never betrayed by passion or enthusiasm into  rash adventures, and he loved the substance, rather than the pomp and  circumstance of power. Untrammelled by scruples, unimpeded by principles,  he pursued with constant fidelity the task of his life, to secure the  throne for himself and his children, to pacify his country, and to  repair the waste of the civil wars. Folly easily glides into war, but  to establish a permanent peace required all Henry's patience, clear  sight and far sight, caution and tenacity. A full exchequer, not empty  glory, was his first requisite, and he found in his foreign wars a  mine of money. Treason at home was turned to like profit, and the  forfeited estates of rebellious lords accumulated in the hands of the  royal family and filled the national coffers. Attainder, the  characteristic instrument of Tudor policy, was employed to         (p. 037)  complete the ruin of the old English peerage which the Wars of the  Roses began: and by 1509 there was only one duke and one marquis left  in the whole of England.[71] Attainder not only removed the particular  traitor, but disqualified his family for place and power; and the process  of eliminating feudalism from the region of government, started by  Edward I., was finished by Henry VII. Feudal society has been described  as a pyramid; the upper slopes were now washed away leaving an  impassable precipice, with the Tudor monarch alone in his glory at its  summit. Royalty had become a caste apart. Marriages between royal  children and English peers had hitherto been no uncommon thing; since  Henry VII.'s accession there have been but four, two of them in our  own day. Only one took place in the sixteenth century, and the Duke of  Suffolk was by some thought worthy of death for his presumption in  marrying the sister of Henry VIII. The peerage was weakened not only  by diminishing numbers, but by the systematic depression of those who  remained. Henry VII., like Ferdinand of Aragon,[72] preferred to  govern by means of lawyers and churchmen; they could be rewarded by  judgeships and bishoprics, and required no grants from the royal  estates. Their occupancy of office kept out territorial magnates who  abused it for private ends. Of the sixteen regents nominated by Henry  VIII. in his will, not one could boast a peerage of twelve years'  standing;[73] and all the great Tudor ministers, Wolsey and        (p. 038)  Cromwell, Cecil and Walsingham, were men of comparatively humble birth.  With similar objects Henry VII. passed laws limiting the number of  retainers and forbidding the practice of maintenance. The courts of  Star Chamber and Requests were developed to keep in order his powerful  subjects and give poor men protection against them. Their civil law  procedure, influenced by Roman imperial maxims, served to enhance the  royal power and dignity, and helped to build up the Tudor autocracy.                       [Footnote 71: The Duke was Buckingham, and the                     Marquis was Dorset.]                       [Footnote 72: See a description of Ferdinand's                     court by John Stile, the English envoy, in _L. and                     P._, i., 490.]                       [Footnote 73: See the present writer's _England                     under Protector Somerset_, p. 38.]           *       *       *       *       *    To the office of king thus developed and magnified, the young Prince  who stood upon the steps of the throne brought personal qualities of  the highest order, and advantages to which his father was completely a  stranger. His title was secure, his treasury overflowed, and he  enjoyed the undivided affections of his people. There was no alternative  claimant. The White Rose, indeed, had languished in the Tower since  his surrender by Philip, and the Duke of Buckingham had some years  before been mentioned as a possible successor to the throne;[74] but  their claims only served to remind men that nothing but Henry's life  stood between them and anarchy, for his young brother Edmund, Duke of  Somerset, had preceded Arthur to an early grave. Upon the single  thread of Henry's life hung the peace of the realm; no other could  have secured the throne without a second civil war. It was small  wonder if England regarded Henry with a somewhat extravagant loyalty.  Never had king ascended the throne more richly endowed with mental and  physical gifts. He was ten weeks short of his eighteenth year.     (p. 039)  From both his parents he inherited grace of mind and of person. His  father in later years was broken in health and soured in spirit, but  in the early days of his reign he had charmed the citizens of York  with his winning smile. His mother is described by the Venetian  ambassador as a woman of great beauty and ability. She transmitted to  Henry many of the popular characteristics of her father, Edward IV.,  though little of the military genius of that consummate commander who  fought thirteen pitched battles and lost not one. Unless eye-witnesses  sadly belied themselves, Henry VIII. must have been the desire of all  eyes. \"His Majesty,\" wrote one a year or two later,[75] \"is the  handsomest potentate I ever set eyes on; above the usual height, with  an extremely fine calf to his leg; his complexion fair and bright,  with auburn hair combed straight and short in the French fashion, and  a round face so very beautiful that it would become a pretty woman,  his throat being rather long and thick.... He speaks French, English,  Latin, and a little Italian; plays well on the lute and harpsichord,  sings from the book at sight, draws the bow with greater strength than  any man in England, and jousts marvellously.\" Another foreign resident  in 1519[76] described him as \"extremely handsome. Nature could not  have done more for him. He is much handsomer than any other sovereign  in Christendom; a great deal handsomer than the King of France; very  fair and his whole frame admirably proportioned. On hearing that  Francis I. wore a beard, he allowed his own to grow, and as it is  (p. 040)  reddish, he has now got a beard that looks like gold. He is very  accomplished, a good musician, composes well, is a capital horseman, a  fine jouster, speaks French, Latin, and Spanish.... He is very fond of  hunting, and never takes his diversion without tiring eight or ten  horses which he causes to be stationed beforehand along the line of  country he means to take, and when one is tired he mounts another, and  before he gets home they are all exhausted. He is extremely fond of  tennis, at which game it is the prettiest thing in the world to see  him play, his fair skin glowing through a shirt of the finest  texture.\"                       [Footnote 74: _L. and P., Henry VII._, i., 180,                     233, 319.]                       [Footnote 75:_L. and P._, ii., 395.]                       [Footnote 76: Giustinian, _Despatches_, ii., 312;                     _Ven. Cal._, ii., 1287; _L. and P._, iii., 402.]    The change from the cold suspicious Henry VII. to such a king as this  was inevitably greeted with a burst of rapturous enthusiasm. \"I have  no fear,\" wrote Mountjoy to Erasmus,[77] \"but when you heard that our  Prince, now Henry the Eighth, whom we may well call our Octavius, had  succeeded to his father's throne, all your melancholy left you at  once. For what may you not promise yourself from a Prince, with whose  extraordinary and almost Divine character you are well acquainted....  But when you know what a hero he now shows himself, how wisely he  behaves, what a lover he is of justice and goodness, what affection he  bears to the learned, I will venture to swear that you will need no  wings to make you fly to behold this new and auspicious star. If you  could see how all the world here is rejoicing in the possession of so  great a Prince, how his life is all their desire, you could not  contain your tears for joy. The heavens laugh, the earth exults, all  things are full of milk, of honey, of nectar! Avarice is expelled the  country. Liberality scatters wealth with a bounteous hand. Our     (p. 041)  King does not desire gold or gems or precious metals, but virtue,  glory, immortality.\" The picture is overdrawn for modern taste, but  making due allowance for Mountjoy's turgid efforts to emulate his  master's eloquence, enough remains to indicate the impression made by  Henry on a peer of liberal education. His unrivalled skill in national  sports and martial exercises appealed at least as powerfully to the  mass of his people. In archery, in wrestling, in joust and in tourney,  as well as in the tennis court or on the hunting field, Henry was a  match for the best in his kingdom. None could draw a bow, tame a  steed, or shiver a lance more deftly than he, and his single-handed  tournaments on horse and foot with his brother-in-law, the Duke of  Suffolk, are likened by one who watched them to the combats of  Achilles and Hector. These are no mere trifles below the dignity of  history; they help to explain the extraordinary hold Henry obtained  over popular imagination. Suppose there ascended the throne to-day a  young prince, the hero of the athletic world, the finest oar, the best  bat, the crack marksman of his day, it is easy to imagine the  enthusiastic support he would receive from thousands of his people who  care much for sport, and nothing at all for politics. Suppose also  that that prince were endowed with the iron will, the instinctive  insight into the hearts of his people, the profound aptitude for  government that Henry VIII."]]]
