About the latter end of November, 1828, this poor woman found her way to  the office of the Anti-Slavery Society in Aldermanbury, by the aid of a  person who had become acquainted with her situation, and had advised her  to apply there for advice and assistance. After some preliminary  examination into the accuracy of the circumstances related by her, I went  along with her to Mr. George Stephen, solicitor, and requested him to  investigate and draw up a statement of her case, and have it submitted to  counsel, in order to ascertain whether or not, under the circumstances,  her freedom could be legally established on her return to Antigua. On this  occasion, in Mr. Stephen's presence and mine, she expressed, in very  strong terms, her anxiety to return thither if she could go as a free  person, and, at the same time, her extreme apprehensions of the fate that  would probably await her if she returned as a slave. Her words were, \"I  would rather go into my grave than go back a slave to Antigua, though I  wish to go back to my husband very much--very much--very much! I am much  afraid my owners would separate me from my husband, and use me very hard,  or perhaps sell me for a field negro;--and slavery is too too bad. I would  rather go into my grave!\"    The paper which Mr. Wood had given her before she left his house, was  placed by her in Mr. Stephen's hands. It was expressed in the following  terms:--         \"I have already told Molly, and now give it her in writing,       in order that there may be no misunderstanding on her part,       that as I brought her from Antigua at her own request and       entreaty, and that she is consequently now free, she is of       course at liberty to take her baggage and go where she       pleases. And, in consequence of her late conduct, she must       do one of two things--either quit the house, or return to       Antigua by the earliest opportunity, as she does not evince       a disposition to make herself useful. As she is a stranger       in London, I do not wish to turn her out, or would do so,       as two female servants are sufficient for my establishment.       If after this she does remain, it will be only during her       good behaviour: but on no consideration will I allow her       wages or any other remuneration for her services.         \"JOHN A. WOOD.\"         \"London, August 18, 1828.\"    This paper, though not devoid of inconsistencies, which will be apparent  to any attentive reader, is craftily expressed; and was well devised to  serve the purpose which the writer had obviously in view, namely, to  frustrate any appeal which the friendless black woman might make to the  sympathy of strangers, and thus prevent her from obtaining an asylum, if  she left his house, from any respectable family. As she had no one to  refer to for a character in this country except himself, he doubtless  calculated securely on her being speedily driven back, as soon as the  slender fund she had in her possession was expended, to throw herself  unconditionally upon his tender mercies; and his disappointment in this  expectation appears to have exasperated his feelings of resentment towards  the poor woman, to a degree which few persons alive to the claims of  common justice, not to speak of christianity or common humanity, could  easily have anticipated. Such, at least, seems the only intelligible  inference that can be drawn from his subsequent conduct.    The case having been submitted, by desire of the Anti-Slavery Committee,  to the consideration of Dr. Lushington and Mr. Sergeant Stephen, it was  found that there existed no legal means of compelling Mary's master to  grant her manumission; and that if she returned to Antigua, she would  inevitably fall again under his power, or that of his attorneys, as a  slave. It was, however, resolved to try what could be effected for her by  amicable negotiation; and with this view Mr. Ravenscroft, a solicitor,  (Mr. Stephen's relative,) called upon Mr. Wood, in order to ascertain  whether he would consent to Mary's manumission on any reasonable terms,  and to refer, if required, the amount of compensation for her value to  arbitration. Mr. Ravenscroft with some difficulty obtained one or two  interviews, but found Mr. Wood so full of animosity against the woman, and  so firmly bent against any arrangement having her freedom for its object,  that the negotiation was soon broken off as hopeless. The angry  slave-owner declared \"that he would not move a finger about her in this  country, or grant her manumission on any terms whatever; and that if she  went back to the West Indies, she must take the consequences.\"    This unreasonable conduct of Mr. Wood, induced the Anti-Slavery Committee,  after several other abortive attempts to effect a compromise, to think of  bringing the case under the notice of Parliament. The heads of Mary's  statement were accordingly engrossed in a Petition, which Dr. Lushington  offered to present, and to give notice at the same time of his intention  to bring in a Bill to provide for the entire emancipation of all slaves  brought to England with the owner's consent. But before this step was  taken, Dr. Lushington again had recourse to negotiation with the master;  and, partly through the friendly intervention of Mr. Manning, partly by  personal conference, used every persuasion in his power to induce Mr. Wood  to relent and let the bondwoman go free. Seeing the matter thus seriously  taken up, Mr. Wood became at length alarmed,--not relishing, it appears,  the idea of having the case publicly discussed in the House of Commons;  and to avert this result he submitted to temporize--assumed a demeanour of  unwonted civility, and even hinted to Mr. Manning (as I was given to  understand) that if he was not driven to utter hostility by the threatened  exposure, he would probably meet our wishes \"in his own time and way.\"  Having gained time by these manoeuvres, he adroitly endeavoured to cool  the ardour of Mary's new friends, in her cause, by representing her as an  abandoned and worthless woman, ungrateful towards him, and undeserving of  sympathy from others; allegations which he supported by the ready  affirmation of some of his West India friends, and by one or two plausible  letters procured from Antigua. By these and like artifices he appears  completely to have imposed on Mr. Manning, the respectable West India  merchant whom Dr. Lushington had asked to negotiate with him; and he  prevailed so far as to induce Dr. Lushington himself (actuated by the  benevolent view of thereby best serving Mary's cause,) to abstain from any  remarks upon his conduct when the petition was at last presented in  Parliament. In this way he dextrously contrived to neutralize all our  efforts, until the close of the Session of 1829; soon after which he  embarked with his family for the West Indies.    Every exertion for Mary's relief having thus failed; and being fully  convinced from a twelvemonth's observation of her conduct, that she was  really a well-disposed and respectable woman; I engaged her, in December  1829, as a domestic servant in my own family. In this capacity she has  remained ever since; and I am thus enabled to speak of her conduct and  character with a degree of confidence I could not have otherwise done. The  importance of this circumstance will appear in the sequel.    From the time of Mr. Wood's departure to Antigua, in 1829, till June or  July last, no farther effort was attempted for Mary's relief. Some faint  hope was still cherished that this unconscionable man would at length  relent, and \"in his own time and way,\" grant the prayer of the exiled  negro woman. After waiting, however, nearly twelve months longer, and  seeing the poor woman's spirits daily sinking under the sickening  influence of hope deferred, I resolved on a final attempt in her behalf,  through the intervention of the Moravian Missionaries, and of the Governor  of Antigua. At my request, Mr. Edward Moore, agent of the Moravian  Brethren in London, wrote to the Rev. Joseph Newby, their Missionary in  that island, empowering him to negotiate in his own name with Mr. Wood for  Mary's manumission, and to procure his consent, if possible, upon terms of  ample pecuniary compensation. At the same time the excellent and  benevolent William Allen, of the Society of Friends, wrote to Sir Patrick  Ross, the Governor of the Colony, with whom he was on terms of friendship,  soliciting him to use his influence in persuading Mr. Wood to consent: and  I confess I was sanguine enough to flatter myself that we should thus at  length prevail. The result proved, however, that I had not yet fully  appreciated the character of the man we had to deal with.    Mr. Newby's answer arrived early in November last, mentioning that he had  done all in his power to accomplish our purpose, but in vain; and that if  Mary's manumission could not be obtained without Mr. Wood's consent, he  believed there was no prospect of its ever being effected.    A few weeks afterwards I was informed by Mr. Allen, that he had received a  letter from Sir Patrick Ross, stating that he also had used his best  endeavours in the affair, but equally without effect. Sir Patrick at the  same time inclosed a letter, addressed by Mr. Wood to his Secretary, Mr.  Taylor, assigning his reasons for persisting in this extraordinary course.  This letter requires our special attention. Its tenor is as follows:--         \"My dear Sir,         \"In reply to your note relative to the woman Molly, I beg       you will have the kindness to oblige me by assuring his       Excellency that I regret exceedingly my inability to comply       with his request, which under other "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17860"],[0,"Stories from Hans Andersen (#9)"],[1,"    'But what is the meaning of this?' said the emperor.    All the courtiers railed at it, and said it was a most ungrateful bird.    'We have got the best bird though,' said they, and then the artificial  bird had to sing again, and this was the thirty-fourth time that they  heard the same tune, but they did not know it thoroughly even yet,  because it was so difficult.    The music-master praised the bird tremendously, and insisted that it was  much better than the real nightingale, not only as regarded the outside  with all the diamonds, but the inside too.    'Because you see, my ladies and gentlemen, and the emperor before all,  in the real nightingale you never know what you will hear, but in the  artificial one everything is decided beforehand! So it is, and so it  must remain, it can't be otherwise. You can account for things, you can  open it and show the human ingenuity in arranging the waltzes, how they  go, and how one note follows upon another!'    'Those are exactly my opinions,' they all said, and the music-master got  leave to show the bird to the public next Sunday. They were also to hear  it sing, said the emperor. So they heard it, and all became as  enthusiastic over it as if they had drunk themselves merry on tea,  because that is a thoroughly Chinese habit.    Then they all said 'Oh,' and stuck their forefingers in the air and  nodded their heads; but the poor fishermen who had heard the real  nightingale said, 'It sounds very nice, and it is very like the real  one, but there is something wanting, we don't know what.' The real  nightingale was banished from the kingdom.    The artificial bird had its place on a silken cushion, close to the  emperor's bed: all the presents it had received of gold and precious  jewels were scattered round it. Its title had risen to be 'Chief  Imperial Singer of the Bed-Chamber,' in rank number one, on the left  side; for the emperor reckoned that side the important one, where the  heart was seated. And even an emperor's heart is on the left side. The  music-master wrote five-and-twenty volumes about the artificial bird;  the treatise was very long and written in all the most difficult Chinese  characters. Everybody said they had read and understood it, for  otherwise they would have been reckoned stupid, and then their bodies  would have been trampled upon.    [Illustration: _The music-master wrote five-and-twenty volumes about the  artificial bird; the treatise was very long and written in all the most  difficult Chinese characters._]    Things went on in this way for a whole year. The emperor, the court, and  all the other Chinamen knew every little gurgle in the song of the  artificial bird by heart; but they liked it all the better for this, and  they could all join in the song themselves. Even the street boys  sang 'zizizi' and 'cluck, cluck, cluck,' and the emperor sang it too.    But one evening when the bird was singing its best, and the emperor was  lying in bed listening to it, something gave way inside the bird with a  'whizz.' Then a spring burst, 'whirr' went all the wheels, and the music  stopped. The emperor jumped out of bed and sent for his private  physicians, but what good could they do? Then they sent for the  watchmaker, and after a good deal of talk and examination he got the  works to go again somehow; but he said it would have to be saved as much  as possible, because it was so worn out, and he could not renew the  works so as to be sure of the tune. This was a great blow! They only  dared to let the artificial bird sing once a year, and hardly that; but  then the music-master made a little speech, using all the most difficult  words. He said it was just as good as ever, and his saying it made it  so.    Five years now passed, and then a great grief came upon the nation, for  they were all very fond of their emperor, and he was ill and could not  live, it was said. A new emperor was already chosen, and people stood  about in the street, and asked the gentleman-in-waiting how their  emperor was going on.    'P,' answered he, shaking his head.    The emperor lay pale and cold in his gorgeous bed, the courtiers thought  he was dead, and they all went off to pay their respects to their new  emperor. The lackeys ran off to talk matters over, and the chambermaids  gave a great coffee-party. Cloth had been laid down in all the rooms and  corridors so as to deaden the sound of footsteps, so it was very, very  quiet. But the emperor was not dead yet. He lay stiff and pale in the  gorgeous bed with its velvet hangings and heavy golden tassels. There  was an open window high above him, and the moon streamed in upon the  emperor, and the artificial bird beside him.    The poor emperor could hardly breathe, he seemed to have a weight on his  chest, he opened his eyes, and then he saw that it was Death sitting  upon his chest, wearing his golden crown. In one hand he held the  emperor's golden sword, and in the other his imperial banner. Round  about, from among the folds of the velvet hangings peered many curious  faces: some were hideous, others gentle and pleasant. They were all the  emperor's good and bad deeds, which now looked him in the face when  Death was weighing him down.    'Do you remember that?' whispered one after the other; 'Do you remember  this?' and they told him so many things that the perspiration poured  down his face.    'I never knew that,' said the emperor. 'Music, music, sound the great  Chinese drums!' he cried, 'that I may not hear what they are saying.'  But they went on and on, and Death sat nodding his head, just like a  Chinaman, at everything that was said.    'Music, music!' shrieked the emperor. 'You precious little golden bird,  sing, sing! I have loaded you with precious stones, and even hung my own  golden slipper round your neck; sing, I tell you, sing!'    But the bird stood silent; there was nobody to wind it up, so of course  it could not go. Death continued to fix the great empty sockets of his  eyes upon him, and all was silent, so terribly silent.    Suddenly, close to the window, there was a burst of lovely song; it was  the living nightingale, perched on a branch outside. It had heard of the  emperor's need, and had come to bring comfort and hope to him. As it  sang the faces round became fainter and fainter, and the blood coursed  with fresh vigour in the emperor's veins and through his feeble limbs.  Even Death himself listened to the song and said, 'Go on, little  nightingale, go on!'    'Yes, if you give me the gorgeous golden sword; yes, if you give me the  imperial banner; yes, if you give me the emperor's crown.'    And Death gave back each of these treasures for a song, and the  nightingale went on singing. It sang about the quiet churchyard, when  the roses bloom, where the elder flower scents the air, and where the  fresh grass is ever moistened anew by the tears of the mourner. This  song brought to Death a longing for his own garden, and, like a cold  grey mist, he passed out of the window.    'Thanks, thanks!' said the emperor; 'you heavenly little bird, I know  you! I banished you from my kingdom, and yet you have charmed the evil  visions away from my bed by your song, and even Death away from my  heart! How can I ever repay you?'    'You have rewarded me,' said the nightingale. 'I brought the tears to  your eyes, the very first time I ever sang to you, and I shall never  forget it! Those are the jewels which gladden the heart of a  singer;--but sleep now, and wake up fresh and strong! I will sing to  you!'    Then it sang again, and the emperor fell into a sweet refreshing sleep.  The sun shone in at his window, when he woke refreshed and well; none of  his attendants had yet come back to him, for they thought he was dead,  but the nightingale still sat there singing.    'You must always stay with me!' said the emperor. 'You shall only sing  when you like, and I will break the artificial bird into a thousand  pieces!'    [Illustration: _Even Death himself listened to the song and said, 'Go  on, little nightingale, go on!'_]    'Don't do that!' said the nightingale, 'it did all the good it could!  keep it as you have always done! I can't build my nest and live in this  palace, but let me come whenever I like, then I will sit on the branch  in the evening, and sing to you. I will sing to cheer you and to make  you thoughtful too; I will sing to you of the happy ones, and of those  that suffer too. I will sing about the good and the evil, which are kept  hidden from you. The little singing bird flies far and wide, to the poor  fisherman, and the peasant's home, to numbers who are far from you and  your court. I love your heart more than your crown, and yet there is an  odour of sanctity round the crown too!--I will come, and I will  sing to you!--But you must promise me one thing!--    'Everything!' said the emperor, who stood there in his imperial robes  which he had just put on, and he held the sword heavy with gold upon his  heart.    'One thing I ask you! Tell no one that you have a little bird who tells  you everything; it will be better so!'    Then the nightingale flew away. The attendants came in to see after  their dead emperor, and there he stood, bidding them 'Good morning!'          THE REAL PRINCESS      There was once a prince, and he wanted a princess, but then she must be  a _real_ Princess. He travelled right round the world to find one, but  there was always something wrong. There were plenty of princesses, but  whether they were real princesses he had great difficulty in  discovering; there was always something which was not quite right about  them. So at last he had to come home again, and he was very sad because  he wanted a real princess so badly.    One evening there was a terrible storm; it thundered and lightened and  the rain poured down in torrents; indeed it was a fearful night.    In the middle of the storm somebody knocked at the town gate, and the  old"]]]
