Vol. 1 (of 2) (#9)"],[1,"Church, Prince, and People from our late  intestine calamities, of which we were altogether unmindfull, even to  astonishment.'    Like Wren and Hooke, Evelyn submitted a scheme for the rebuilding of  London upon an improved plan, but the new city was formed mainly upon  the old lines.    Meanwhile the Dutch fleet was lying off the mouth of the Thames. Though  England then happily produced all the food she required, yet the city  became 'exceedingly distress'd for want of fuell' because of the traffic  up and down the estuary being interrupted. Hence Evelyn was appointed  one of a Committee to search the environs of London and find if any peat  or turf were fit for use. Experiments were made with _houllies_ or  briquettes of charcoal dust and loam in the Dutch manner, and Evelyn  shewed to many proof of his 'new fuell, which was very glowing and  without smoke or ill smell'. But the process never caught on, and was  abandoned as giving no promise of commercial success.    Evelyn's account against the Treasury now amounted to above L34,000, and  he continued to urge for payment of it, or for the settlement of unpaid  portions of it, as late as 1702, about three years before his death.  Whether this straitened his means or not, he was at any rate eager to  make money by speculation. So in 1667 he joined Sir John Kiviet, a Dutch  Orangeman who had come over to England for protection and had been  knighted by King Charles, in a scheme for making bricks on a large  scale. Perhaps as a sort of advertisement of this commercial enterprise  he subscribed 50,000 bricks towards building a college for the Royal  Society. It was a big scheme, including the embankment of the river from  the Tower to the Temple, and if successful it would have brought much  gain to the partners.    Evelyn says nothing about the ultimate results of his undertaking, but  Pepys furnishes the necessary clue in his diary for September,  1668--'23d. At noon comes Mr Evelyn to me, about some business with the  office, and there in discourse tell me of his loss, to the value of  L500, which he hath met with in a late attempt of making of bricks upon  an adventure with others, by which he presumed to have got a great deal  of money; so that I see the most ingenious man may sometimes be  mistaken'. Kiviet a year or two later on had a fresh scheme for draining  marshy lands 'with the hopes of a rich harvest of hemp and cole seed',  but Evelyn took no share in this new adventure.    In July 1669 his University, Oxford, bestowed upon him the honorary  degree of Doctor of Civil Law, but he had still no permanent official  appointment, his Commissionerships now being completed. Early in May  1670 he went 'to London concerning the office of Latine Secretary to his  Majesty, a place of more honor than dignitie and profit, the revertion  of which he had promised me', though the promise was not fulfilled.    Early in 1669, it had been proposed to Evelyn by Lord Arlington that he  should write a history of the Dutch War, but he declined. Towards the  middle of the following year, however, pressure was brought on him to  undertake the work. 'After dinner Lord (Arlington) communicated to me  his Majesty's desire that I would engage to write the History of our  late War with the Hollanders, which I had hitherto declin'd; this I  found was ill-taken, and that I should disoblige his Majesty, who had  made choice of me to do him this service, and if I would undertake it, I  should have all the assistance the Secretary's office and others could  give me, with other encouragements, which I could not decently refuse'.  This work was never completed, so much as was written by way of  introduction being subsequently published in 1674 as _Navigation and  Commerce, their Original and Progress_.    Evelyn was, however, not to have much longer to wait for regular  official employment, as on 28 February, 1671, 'The Treasurer acquainted  me that his Majesty was graciously pleas'd to nominate me one of the  Council of Forraine Plantations, and give me a salary of L500 per ann.  to encourage me'. He was pleased with his appointment in connection with  our Colonies, 'a considerable honour, the others in the Council being  chiefly Noblemen, and Officers of State'. In the following year the  scope of this department was increased by adding the Council of Trade to  its duties. He at once went to thank the Treasurer and Lord Arlington,  Secretary of State, whose favour he possessed though he 'cultivated  neither of their friendships by any meane submissions'. And he failed  not, of course, to kiss the King's hand on being made one of that newly  established Council. But Royalist though he was, he could not be blind  to the profligacy of the Court and of the King, to whose Majesty his  works were so grandiloquently dedicated.    On one occasion after submitting progress of his History to the King, he  says 'thence walk'd with him thro' St. James's Parke to the garden,  where I both saw and heard a very familiar discourse between... and Mrs.  Nellie as they cal'd an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden  on a terrace at the top of the wall, and... standing on ye greene walke  under it. I was heartily sorry at the scene. Thence the King walked to  the Dutchess of Cleaveland, another lady of pleasure, and curse of our  nation'. Evelyn is usually so strict about any reference to the  proprieties that it is hard to understand why this particular interview  between King Charles and Nell Gwynne should be mentioned so  circumstantially. As for the Court, when it went abroad, say to  Newmarket, one might have 'found ye jolly blades racing, dauncing,  feasting, and revelling, more resembling a luxurious and abandon'd rout,  than a Christian Court.'    Early in 1672 his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, resigned office as  Clerk of the Council, a place which his Majesty had years before  promised to Evelyn; but he was induced to give up this lien on renewal  of the lease of Sayes Court for 99 years, although the King's written  engagement to grant the estate in fee-farme is still extant at Wotton.  In 1673 Browne became Master of the Trinity House, and Evelyn was sworn  in as a younger Brother, having in the previous autumn been chosen  Secretary to the Royal Society: and two months later his son John, now  18 years of age, was also made a younger brother of Trinity House.  Evelyn's life seems now to have glided on very quietly. Much of his time  was taken up with the colonial and commercial work controlled by the  Council of Plantations and Trade, though he still found leisure for  literary work, scientific recreation, and other affairs. His mind  apparently about this time became greatly attracted towards religious  subjects, and it seems more than probable that this may (in part, at any  rate) have been due to a very strong though purely platonic attachment  he now formed to Miss Blagg, one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, who  married Mr. Sydney, afterwards Lord Godolphin, in 1675 and died in  childbed in 1678 at the early age of twenty five. His _Life of Mrs  Godolphin_, never published till 1847, was 'design'd to consecrate her  worthy life to posterity.' In February 1680 his son John, now 23 years  of age and imitating his father's literary beginning as a translator,  was married to Martha Spencer, step-daughter of Sir John Stonehouse.  That Evelyn was now fairly well off is evident from the terms of the  jointure and marriage contracts then made. 'The lady was to bring L5,000  in consideration of a settlement of L500 a yeare present maintainence,  which was likewise to be her jointure, and L500 a yeare after myne and  my Wife's decease. But with God's blessing it will be at the least L1000  a yeare more in a few yeares.' Always of business habits, Evelyn  particularly records how, in the following month, he went 'To London, to  receive L3,000 of my daughter-in-law's portion, which was paid in gold.'    The deeply religious caste of thought above alluded to as now becoming  very noticeable in Evelyn shewed itself strongly in the autumn of 1680.  'I went to London to be private, my birthday being ye next day, and I  now arriv'd at my sixtieth year, on which I began a more solemn survey  of my whole life, in order to the making and confirming my peace with  God, by an accurate scrutinie of all my actions past, as far as I was  able to call them to mind. How difficult and uncertaine, yet how  necessary a work! The Lord be mercifull to me and accept me! Who can  tell how oft he offendeth?... I began and spent the whole weeke in  examining my life, begging pardon for my faults, assistance and blessing  for the future, that I might in some sort be prepar'd for the time that  now drew neere, and not have the greater work to begin when one can  worke no longer. The Lord Jesus help and assist me! I therefore stirr'd  little abroad till the 5 November..... I participated of ye blessed  communion, finishing and confirming my resolutions of giving myselfe up  more intirely to God, to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest  of the poore remainder of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who  am an unprofitable servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his  infinite goodnesse and mercy accepting my endeavours.'    It were well if all men, even before attaining 60 years of age, could  bring themselves to such periods of reflection on past and present acts,  and even though all the good resolves may not have been quite rigidly  acted up to. And even in Evelyn's case, at any rate so far as his diary  shews, he appears afterwards to have continued just as much a man of the  world as he was before these solemn resolutions, although the glamour of  being a courtier seems perhaps to have henceforth become less  rose-coloured. A trivial incident happening while he was supping one  night at Lady Arlington's, in June 1683, gave rise to the reflection  that 'By this one may take an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#9)"],[1,"who hunger, for I will lead them to My Father's  table! Blessed are they who thirst, for they shall drink of the  fountains of heaven! Blessed are they who weep, for I will dry their  tears with veils finer than those of the almehs!'    \"That is why the poor loved Him, and believed in Him. But the rich hated  Him; fearing that He should raise the poor above them. At that time,  Cleopatra and Caesar were powerful on the earth. They both hated Jesus,  and they ordered the judges and priests to put Him to death. To obey the  Queen of Egypt, the princes of Syria erected a cross on a high mountain,  and they caused Jesus to die on this cross. But women washed His corpse,  and buried it; and Prince Jesus, having broken the door of His tomb,  rose again to the good Lord, His Father.    \"And, from that time, all those who believed in Him go to heaven.    \"The Lord God opens His arms, and says to them--    \"'Ye are welcome, because ye love the Prince, My Son. Wash, and then  eat.'    \"They bathe to the sound of beautiful music, and, all the time they are  eating, they see almehs dancing, and they listen to tales that never  end. They are dearer to the good Lord God than the light of His eyes,  because they are His guests, and they shall have for their portion the  carpets of His house, and the pomegranates of His gardens.\"    Ahmes often spoke in this strain, and thus taught the truth to Thais.  She wondered, and said--    \"I should like to eat the pomegranates of the good Lord.\"    Ahmes replied--    \"Only those who are baptised may taste the fruits of heaven.\"    And Thais asked to be baptised. Seeing by this that she believed in  Jesus, the slave resolved to instruct her more fully, so that, being  baptised, she might enter the Church; and he loved her as his spiritual  daughter.    The child, unloved and uncared for by its selfish parents, had no bed  in the house. She slept in a corner of the stable amongst the domestic  animals, and there Ahmes came to her every night secretly.    He gently approached the mat on which she lay, and sat down on his  heels, his legs bent and his body straight--a position hereditary to his  race. His face and his body, which was clothed in black, were invisible  in the darkness; but his big white eyes shone out, and there came from  them a light like a ray of dawn through the chinks of a door. He spoke  in a husky, monotonous tone, with a slight nasal twang that gave it  the soft melody of music heard at night in the streets. Sometimes the  breathing of an ass, or the soft lowing of an ox, accompanied, like a  chorus of invisible spirits, the voice of the slave as he recited the  gospels. His words flowed gently in the darkness, which they filled  with zeal, mercy, and hope; and the neophyte, her hand in that of Ahmes,  lulled by the monotonous sounds, and the vague visions in her mind,  slept calm and smiling, amid the harmonies of the dark night and the  holy mysteries, gazed down on by a star, which twinkled between the  joists of the stable-roof.    The initiation lasted a whole year, till the time when the Christians  joyfully celebrate the festival of Easter. One night in the holy week,  Thais, who was already asleep on her mat, felt herself lifted by the  slave, whose eyes gleamed with a strange light. He was clad, not as  usual in a pair of torn drawers, but in a long white cloak, beneath  which he pressed the child, whispering to her--    \"Come, my soul! Come, light of my eyes! Come, little sweetheart! Come  and be clad in the baptismal robes!\"    He carried the child pressed to his breast. Frightened and yet curious,  Thais, her head out of the cloak, threw her arms round her friend's  neck, and he ran with her through the darkness. They went down narrow,  black alleys; they passed through the Jews' quarter; they skirted a  cemetery, where the osprey uttered its dismal cry; they traversed an  open space, passing under crosses on which hung the bodies of victims,  and on the arms of the crosses the ravens clacked their beaks. Thais  hid her head in the slave's breast. She did not dare to peep out all  the rest of the way. Soon it seemed to her that she was going down under  ground. When she reopened her eyes she found herself in a narrow cave,  lighted by resin torches, on the walls of which were painted standing  figures, which seemed to move and live in the flickering glare of the  torches. They were men clad in long tunics and carrying branches of  palm, and around them were lambs, doves, and tendrils of vine.    Amongst these figures, Thais recognised Jesus of Nazareth, by the  anemones flowering at his feet. In the centre of the cave, near a  large stone font filled with water, stood an old man clad in a scarlet  dalmatic embroidered with gold, and on his head a low mitre. His thin  face ended in a long beard. He looked gentle and humble, in spite of  his rich costume. This was Bishop Vivantius, an exiled dignitary of the  Church of Cyrene, who now gained his livelihood by weaving common stuffs  of goats' hair. Two poor children stood by his side. Close by, an old  negress unfolded a little white robe. Ahmes set the child down on the  ground, and kneeling before the Bishop, said--    \"Father, this is the little soul, the child of my soul. I have brought  her that you may, according to your promise, and if it please your  holiness, bestow on her the baptism of life.\"    At these words the Bishop opened his arms, and showed his mutilated  hands. His nails had been torn out because he had maintained the faith  in the days of persecution. Thais was frightened, and threw herself into  the arms of Ahmes. But the kind words of the priest reassured her.    \"Fear nothing, dearly beloved little one. Thou hast here a spiritual  father, Ahmes, who is called Theodore amongst the faithful, and a kind  mother in grace, who has prepared for thee, with her own hands, a white  robe.\"    And turning towards the negress--    \"She is called Nitida,\" he added, \"and is a slave in this world, but in  heaven she will be a spouse of Jesus.\"    Then he said to the child neophyte--    \"Thais, dost thou believe in God, the Father Almighty; and in His only  Son, who died for our salvation; and in all that the apostles taught?\"    \"Yes,\" replied together the negro and negress, who held her by each  hand.    By the Bishop's orders, Nitida knelt down and undressed Thais. The child  was quite naked; round her neck was an amulet. The Pontiff plunged her  three times into the baptismal font. The acolytes brought the oil, with  which Vivantius anointed the catechumen, and the salt, a morsel of  which he placed on her tongue. Then, having dried that body which was  destined, after many trials, to life immortal, the slave Nitida put on  Thais the white robe she had woven.    The Bishop gave to each and all the kiss of peace, and, the ceremony  being terminated, took off his sacerdotal insignia.    When they had left the crypt, Ahmes said--    \"We ought to rejoice that we have this day brought a soul to the good  Lord God; let us go to the house of your Holiness and spend the rest of  the night in rejoicing.\"    \"Thou hast well said, Theodore,\" replied the Bishop, and he led the  little band to his house, which was quite near. It consisted of a single  room, furnished with a couple of looms, a heavy table, and a worn-out  carpet. As soon as they had entered,    \"Nitida,\" cried the Nubian, \"bring hither the stove and the jar of oil,  and we will have a good supper.\"    Saying thus, he drew from under his cloak some little fish which he had  kept concealed, and lighted a fire and fried them. The Bishop, the girl,  the two boys, and the two slaves sat in a ring on the carpet, ate the  fried fish, and blessed the Lord. Vivantius spoke of the torture he had  undergone, and prophesied the speedy triumph of the Church. His language  was grotesque, and full of word-play and rhetorical tropes. He compared  the life of the just to a tissue of purple, and to explain the mystery  of baptism, he said--    \"The Divine Spirit floated on the waters, and that is why Christians  receive the baptism of water. But demons also inhabit the brooks;  springs consecrated to nymphs are especially dangerous, and there are  certain waters which cause various maladies, both of the soul and of the  body.\"    Sometimes he spoke enigmatically, and the child listened to him with  profound awe and wonder. At the end of the repast he offered his guests  a little wine, and this unloosed their tongues, and they began to sing  lamentations and hymns. Ahmes and Nitida then rose, and danced a Nubian  dance which they had learned as children, and which, no doubt, had been  danced by their tribe since the early ages of the world. It was a love  dance; waving their arms, and moving their bodies in rhythmic measure,  they feigned, in turn, to fly from and to pursue each other. Their big  eyes rolled, and they showed their gleaming teeth in broad grins.    In this strange manner did Thais receive the holy rite of baptism.    She loved amusements, and, as she grew, vague desires were created in  her mind. All day long she danced and sang with the children in the  streets, and when at night she returned to her father's house, she was  still singing--    \"Crooked twist, why do you stay in the house? I comb the wool, and the  Miletan threads. Crooked twist, what did your son die of? He fell from  the white horses into the sea.\"    She now began to prefer the company of boys and girls to that of the  gentle and quiet Ahmes. She did not notice that her friend was not so  often with her. The persecution having relented, the Christians were  able to assemble more regularly, and the Nubian frequented these  meetings assiduously. His zeal increased, and he sometimes uttered  mysterious threats. He said that the rich would not keep their wealth.  He went to the public places to which the poorer Christians used to  resort, and assembling together all the poor "]]]
