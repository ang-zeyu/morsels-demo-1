I turned, dizzily, to see Fletcher sinking to his knees, one hand  clutching his breast.    \"She got me ... with the knife,\" he whispered. \"But ... don't worry ...  look to yourself, and ..._him_....\"    He pointed, weakly--then collapsed at my feet. I threw myself upon  the wooden chest with a fierce, sobbing cry.    \"Smith, Smith!\" I babbled, and knew myself no better, in my sorrow,  than an hysterical woman. \"Smith, dear old man! speak to me! speak  to me!...\"    Outraged emotion overcame me utterly, and with my arms thrown across  the box, I slipped into unconsciousness.        CHAPTER IX    FU-MANCHU      Many poignant recollections are mine, more of them bitter than sweet;  but no one of them all can compare with the memory of that moment of  my awakening.    Weymouth was supporting me, and my throat still tingled from the  effects of the brandy which he had forced between my teeth from his  flask. My heart was beating irregularly; my mind yet partly inert.  With something compound of horror and hope I lay staring at one who  was anxiously bending over the Inspector's shoulder, watching me.    _It was Nayland Smith._    A whole hour of silence seemed to pass, ere speech became possible;  then--    \"Smith!\" I whispered, \"are you ...\"    Smith grasped my outstretched, questing hand, grasped it firmly,  warmly; and I saw his gray eyes to be dim in the light of the several  lanterns around us.    \"Am I alive?\" he said. \"Dear old Petrie! Thanks to you, I am not only  alive, but free!\"    My head was buzzing like a hive of bees, but I managed, aided by  Weymouth, to struggle to my feet. Muffled sounds of shouting and  scuffling reached me. Two men in the uniform of the Thames Police were  carrying a limp body in at the low doorway communicating with the  infernal Joy-Shop.    \"It's Fletcher,\" said Weymouth, noting the anxiety expressed in my  face. \"His missing lady friend has given him a nasty wound, but he'll  pull round all right.\"    \"Thank God for that,\" I replied, clutched my aching head. \"I don't  know what weapon she employed in my case, but it narrowly missed  achieving her purpose.\"    My eyes, throughout, were turned upon Smith, for his presence there,  still seemed to me miraculous.    \"Smith,\" I said, \"for Heaven's sake enlighten me! I never doubted  that you were ...\"    \"In the wooden chest!\" concluded Smith grimly, \"Look!\"    He pointed to something that lay behind me. I turned, and saw the box  which had occasioned me such anguish. The top had been wrenched off  and the contents exposed to view. It was filled with a variety of gold  ornaments, cups, vases, silks, and barbaric brocaded raiment; it might  well have contained the loot of a cathedral. Inspector Weymouth  laughed gruffly at my surprise.    \"What is it?\" I asked, in a voice of amazement.    \"It's the treasure of the Si-Fan, I presume,\" rapped Smith. \"Where it  has come from and where it was going to, it must be my immediate  business to ascertain.\"    \"Then you ...\"    \"I was lying, bound and gagged, upon one of the upper shelves in the  opium-den! I heard you and Fletcher arrive. I saw you pass through  later with that she-devil who drove the cab to-day ...\"    \"Then the cab ...\"    \"The windows were fastened, unopenable, and some anaesthetic was  injected into the interior through a tube--that speaking-tube. I know  nothing further, except that our plans must have leaked out in some  mysterious fashion. Petrie, my suspicions point to high quarters. The  Si-Fan score thus far, for unless the search now in progress brings  it to light, we must conclude that they have the brass coffer.\"    He was interrupted by a sudden loud crying of his name.    \"Mr. Nayland Smith!\" came from somewhere within the Joy-Shop. \"This  way, sir!\"    Off he went, in his quick, impetuous manner, whilst I stood there,  none too steadily, wondering what discovery this outcry portended.  I had not long to wait. Out by the low doorway come Smith, a grimly  triumphant smile upon his face, carrying the missing brass coffer!    He set it down upon the planking before me.    \"John Ki,\" he said, \"who was also on the missing list, had dragged  the thing out of the cellar where it was hidden, and in another minute  must have slipped away with it. Detective Deacon saw the light shining  through a crack in the floor. I shall never forget the look John gave  us when we came upon him, as, lamp in hand, he bent over the precious  chest.\"    \"Shall you open it now?\"    \"No.\" He glanced at me oddly. \"I shall have it valued in the morning  by Messrs. Meyerstein.\"    He was keeping something back; I was sure of it.    \"Smith,\" I said suddenly, \"the man with the limp! I heard him in the  place where you were confined! Did you ...\"    Nayland Smith clicked his teeth together sharply, looking straightly  and grimly into my eyes.    \"I _saw_ him!\" he replied slowly; \"and unless the effects of the  anaesthetic had not wholly worn off ...\"    \"Well!\" I cried.    \"The man with the limp is _Dr. Fu-Manchu!_\"        CHAPTER X    THE TULUN-NUR CHEST      \"This box,\" said Mr. Meyerstein, bending attentively over the carven  brass coffer upon the table, \"is certainly of considerable value, and  possibly almost unique.\"    Nayland Smith glanced across at me with a slight smile. Mr. Meyerstein  ran one fat finger tenderly across the heavily embossed figures, which,  like barnacles, encrusted the sides and lid of the weird curio which  we had summoned him to appraise.    \"What do you think, Lewison?\" he added, glancing over his shoulder at  the clerk who accompanied him.    Lewison, whose flaxen hair and light blue eyes almost served to mask  his Semitic origin, shrugged his shoulders in a fashion incongruous  in one of his complexion, though characteristic in one of his name.    \"It is as you say, Mr. Meyerstein, an example of early Tulun-Nur  work,\" he said. \"It may be sixteenth century or even earlier. The  Kuren treasure-chest in the Hague Collection has points of  similarity, but the workmanship of this specimen is infinitely finer.\"    \"In a word, gentlemen,\" snapped Nayland Smith, rising from the  arm-chair in which he had been sitting, and beginning restlessly to  pace the room, \"in a word, you would be prepared to make me a  substantial offer for this box?\"    Mr. Meyerstein, his shrewd eyes twinkling behind the pebbles of his  pince-nez, straightened himself slowly, turned in the ponderous manner  of a fat man, and readjusted the pince-nez upon his nose. He cleared  his throat.    \"I have not yet seen the interior of the box, Mr. Smith,\" he said.    Smith paused in his perambulation of the carpet and stared hard at  the celebrated art dealer.    \"Unfortunately,\" he replied, \"the key is missing.\"    \"Ah!\" cried the assistant, Lewison, excitedly, \"you are mistaken, sir!  Coffers of this description and workmanship are nearly always  complicated conjuring tricks; they rarely open by any such rational  means as lock and key. For instance, the Kuren treasure-chest to  which I referred, opens by an intricate process involving the pressing  of certain knobs in the design, and the turning of others.\"    \"It was ultimately opened,\" said Mr. Meyerstein, with a faint note of  professional envy in his voice, \"by one of Christie's experts.\"    \"Does my memory mislead me,\" I interrupted, \"or was it not regarding  the possession of the chest to which you refer, that the celebrated  case of 'Hague versus Jacobs' arose?\"    \"You are quite right, Dr. Petrie,\" said Meyerstein, turning to me.  \"The original owner, a member of the Younghusband Expedition, had been  unable to open the chest. When opened at Christie's it proved to  contain jewels and other valuables. It was a curious case, wasn't it,  Lewison?\" turning to his clerk.    \"Very,\" agreed the other absently; then--\"Have you endeavored to open  this box, Mr. Smith?\"    Nayland Smith shook his head grimly.    \"From its weight,\" said Meyerstein, \"I am inclined to think that the  contents might prove of interest. With your permission I will  endeavor to open it.\"    Nayland Smith, tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear, stood  looking at the expert. Then--    \"I do not care to attempt it at present,\" he said.    Meyerstein and his clerk stared at the speaker in surprise.    \"But you would be mad,\" cried the former, \"if you accepted an offer for  the box, whilst ignorant of the nature of its contents.\"    \"But I have invited no offer,\" said Smith. \"I do not propose to sell.\"    Meyerstein adjusted his pince-nez again.    \"I am a business man,\" he said, \"and I will make a business proposal:  A hundred guineas for the box, cash down, and our commission to be ten  per cent on the proceeds of the contents. You must remember,\" raising  a fat forefinger to check Smith, who was about to interrupt him, \"that  it may be necessary to force the box in order to open it, thereby  decreasing its market value and making it a bad bargain at a hundred  guineas.\"    Nayland Smith met my gaze across the room; again a slight smile  crossed the lean, tanned face.    \"I can only reply, Mr. Meyerstein,\" he said, \"in this way: if I desire  to place the box on the market, you shall have first refusal, and the  same applies to the contents, if any. For the moment if you will send  me a note of your fee, I shall be obliged.\" He raised his hand with a  conclusive gesture. \"I am not prepared to discuss the question of sale  any further at present, Mr. Meyerstein.\"    At that the dealer bowed, took up his hat from the table, and prepared  to depart. Lewison opened the door and stood aside.    \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" said Meyerstein.    As Lewison was about to follow him--    \"Since you do not intend to open the box,\" he said, turning, his hand  upon the door knob, \"have you any idea of its contents?\"    \"None,\" replied Smith; \"but with my present inadequate knowledge of  its history, I do not care to open it.\"    Lewison smiled skeptically.    \"Pro"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17966"],[0,"Life History of the Kangaroo Rat (#9)"],[1,"(Mexican poppy)                               250  Gaertneria tenuifolia (franseria)                                    Tr.

It will be seen from Table 3 that while a large number of species of  plants are represented in the totals from so many dens, a majority of  them are of very minor importance, and that the seeds of grasses are the  principal storage and probably therefore the principal food material.  Six of the most important species of grasses (disregarding species  furnishing less than 5 grams) comprise 85.6 per cent of the total weight  of storage from 22 dens. Crowfoot grama (_Bouteloua rothrockii_) stands  first in quantity in the total, forming 39.4 per cent of all stored  material, 46 per cent of the six important grasses, and 45 per cent of  all grasses. The largest amount of storage of any one species of grass  in any one den on the Range Reserve also is of this species, 2,205  grams[5] (Table 1, den 1, p. 20, and Pl. VII, Fig. 2). This is exceeded  by a dropseed grass, _Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_, which amounted  to 5,455 grams in a lot from Albuquerque, N. Mex. (Table 1, den 24, and  Pl. VIII, Fig. 1).        [Footnote 5: This amount of dry grama grass seed (heads) amounts to      approximately a bushel.]    Of the species other than grasses found stored in these dens, mesquite  beans (_Prosopis velutina_) are most important both by weight and number  of dens containing them. The total for the 22 Range Reserve dens is  1,570 grams, or 35.9 per cent of the seeds other than grasses, but only  5.1 per cent of the total storage. In bulk mesquite beans do not loom up  large, as they are probably the heaviest material stored. Sections of  pods which must have been dragged into the burrows are found, some of  them certainly being much too long for carriage in the pouches. The  species of plant other than grass found in the largest quantity in any  one den, however, was _Aplopappus gracilis_, not recorded in quantity  from any den until the excavation of the twenty-second, and then found  in a very large bulk of soft, fluffy material, with most of the seeds  separated from the heads, and weighing 1,030 grams (Table 1, den 22).    Any of the food materials above listed are likely to be found in the  cheek pouches, while in addition such extraneous matter as stones and  feces have also been found. All species of plants stored are accessible  in the immediate vicinity of the mound, and when any particular plant is  found seeding in abundance in the vicinity of the den it is likely to be  represented in the storage. Usually the animals can be readily trapped  with almost any kind of grain bait, as oats, rolled oats, rolled barley,  and wheat; and nut meats also are attractive, though we have no record  of the storing of any true nut in the dens, such not being available in  the range of the animal on the Range Reserve.    The following plants not represented in the list stored by the kangaroo  rat on the Range Reserve have been found in the cheek pouches or mounds  of _spectabilis_ in other localities:         _Amaranthus palmeri_, _Sesuvium portulacastrum_, and _Atriplex       wrightii_ (alluvial soil of Santa Cruz Valley, Continental, Ariz.,       Bailey).         Cut leaves and stems of a small sagebrush (Franklin Mountains,       Tex., Gaut).         _Gutierrezia_ heads (San Juan Valley, N. Mex., Birdseye).         _Verbesina enceliodes_, _Portulaca oleracea_, _Bouteloua gracilis_,       and _Munroa squarrosa_ (Rio Alamosa, N. Mex., Goldman).         Tops of buds of _Artemisia filifolia_ (Mesa Jumanes, N. Mex.,       Gaut).         Tumbleweed (_Amaranthus graecizans_), Russian thistle (_Salsola       pestifer_), _Munroa squarrosa_, and _Sporobolus cryptandrus       strictus_ (Sandia Mountains, Albuquerque, N. Mex., Vorhies).          BURROW SYSTEMS, OR DENS.      The burrow system, or den, in which _spectabilis_ stores its caches of  food materials, has its nest, and remains throughout the hours of  daylight is a complicated labyrinth of tunnels. Ejection of refuse and  soil from this retreat builds up the mound frequently referred to. These  mounds are, as Bailey says, characteristic of the species, and are as  unmistakable as muskrat houses or beaver dams, and as carefully planned  and built for as definite a purpose--home and shelter. They are,  furthermore, the most notable of all kangaroo rat dwelling places  (Nelson, 1918, 400). They range in height from 6 inches to approximately  4 feet and from 5 to 15 feet in diameter.    The mound is built up not only through the cleaning out of chaff and  other food refuse, but through extension and modification of the  tunnels; old tunnels, entrances, and caches of musty food material are  from time to time closed up and others excavated, repair and rebuilding  being especially necessary after the collapse of portions of the den as  a result of heavy rains or trampling by cattle. Ejected material is most  commonly simply thrown out fan-wise from the openings, without much  apparent effort to add to the height of the mound.    There are usually from 6 to 12 entrance holes in each mound opening into  the subterranean burrow system, each hole from 4 to 5-1/2 inches in  diameter. These holes are nearly all situated a little above the surface  of the surrounding soil, and as Price has suggested (in Allen, 1895,  213), this is doubtless a wise provision against flooding, as torrential  rains sometimes occur in the kangaroo rat country.    Both Bailey and Nelson state that as a rule several of the holes are  closed with sand or miscellaneous earth and old storage material during  the daytime, but our observations on the Range Reserve are that such  closing is only occasional. Many occupied dens have not a single  opening closed. Further, night observations disclose that the inhabitant  of the mound will appear from some one of the two or three most-used  openings when night falls, and not necessarily from one which has been  closed by day. Recently an opening closed one day was observed in use  during the night, but was left open all the next day.    In attempting to determine whether there exist similarities of plan or  system in the dens, it was considered advisable to map them with some  degree of accuracy. This we were enabled to do by laying off a square  about a given mound, 2-1/2 or 3 meters each way, and subdividing it into  a series of small squares of half a meter on each side by drawing  cross-lines on the surface of the ground over the top of the mound. One  person then did the digging and exploring of the tunnels, as to  direction and depth, while the other noted the results on coordinate  paper (Figs. 2 and 3); the proper excavation and mapping of one of these  workings occupied from four to eight hours for the two.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Diagram of a typical den of _Dipodomys  spectabilis spectabilis_. Double shading indicates where one portion of  tunnel lies above another and solid black a three-story arrangement;  _A_, _B_, _C_, etc., active openings to surface; figures without arrows,  depths in centimeters to tunnel roofs; figures with arrows, tunnel  widths in centimeters; _N._ nest chamber; _S_, storage; _OS_, old  storage; _Y_, probably an old nest chamber; _Z_, old, unused, or  partially plugged openings.]    While there is greater complexity in the larger, and probably older,  mounds than in the smaller, all are extremely complicated and can only  be described as labyrinthine in character. The tunnels wind about  through the mound, rising and falling in vertical depth,  intercommunicating frequently, but with occasional cul-de-sacs, and in  places expanding into chambers, of which there may be three or four  large ones. The stored materials are found in some, but not necessarily  all, of these chambers, and may also occupy considerable lengths of  ordinary tunnel, especially when the quantity present is large. Small  evaginations of the tunnels frequently contain lesser caches, and it is  in such pockets that bits of fresh material are placed during a growing  season, or that grain supplied the previous night for bait is usually  found.    The main masses of storage are most often found centrally located at  depths of from 15 to 57 centimeters, although at times one may find a  cache near the periphery of the system and as near the surface as 2 or 3  centimeters. In the latter case the materials are subject to wetting  from rains, and consequent spoilage.    The major portion of the whole tunnel system is within about 50  centimeters of the surface of the mound, but usually some one branch  tunnel goes to somewhat greater depth, and this is "]]]
