Now, I tell you what it is; I am not  going to waste you by allowing you to remain in the forecastle any  longer, so just turn to and get the tar stains off your hands, shift  into a white shirt and a shore-going suit of clothes, and come aft into  the cuddy as ship's surgeon.  There is, very fortunately, a vacant cabin  that you can have; and you may earn the rest of your passage by looking  after the health of the passengers and crew--there are three or four  ladies who are pretty nearly dead with seasickness, and if you can  relieve 'em they'll bless me for discovering you.\"    \"Oh yes,\" answered Dick cheerfully, \"I have no doubt I can relieve them  all right!  But there is one thing with regard to this arrangement that  perhaps you have not thought of, Captain.  Perhaps your passengers will  not approve of your bringing me aft out of the forecastle to associate  with them upon terms of equality.\"    \"Don't you trouble your head about that, my son,\" returned the skipper.  \"That is my affair.  But I'm quite sure that they won't object when I  tell 'em the facts of the case.  Besides, they've already noticed you  while you've been at the wheel, and have remarked what a well-spoken,  gentlemanly young fellow you are.  No, no; that'll be all right, never  fear.  Now, if you've finished with this poor chap for a while, you had  better cut away and make yourself fit for the cuddy, and then shift aft,  bag and baggage.\"    \"Very well, sir, I will, and many thanks to you for the promotion,\"  answered Dick.  \"But we cannot leave Tom here on the table, comfortable  as he is.  Therefore, with your permission, sir, I will call in a couple  of hands, who, with Joe and myself, will be able to put him into the  spare bunk, where he will be out of everybody's way, and where I can  attend to him quite conveniently.\"    To this proposal the worthy skipper at once consented; and half an hour  later Dick, having discarded his working clothes for a suit of blue  serge, and otherwise made himself presentable, moved aft and established  himself in the spare cabin which Captain Roberts placed at his disposal,  the skipper having meanwhile ensured a cordial reception for him from  the passengers by telling them such particulars of Dick's history as he  was acquainted with, and also describing, with much picturesque detail,  the masterly manner in which the lad had patched up the injured seaman.    Dick had no reason to complain of the manner in which the passengers  received him among them; on the contrary, his reception was cordial in  the extreme, especially by the women, to whose sense of romance the  lad's story, as told by the skipper, appealed very strongly.  The  introduction took place just as the passengers--or at least those of  them who were not too ill--were about to sit down to tiffin, and Dick  was assigned a place at the long table halfway between the head and the  foot, where Captain Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe respectively presided; but  the young man declined to sit down until he had visited and relieved his  new patients, consisting of five ladies and three men.    His method of dealing with these unfortunates was simplicity itself.  Relying wholly upon the wonderful power of hypnotism with which his  friend Humphreys had endowed him, he prepared for each patient a draught  consisting of sugar and water only, slightly flavoured with an aromatic  bitter; and, as he presented this, he got the patient under his  influence in the instantaneous manner which Humphreys had taught him, at  the same time saying, in a quietly confident tone of voice:    \"Now, I want you to drink this, please.  It is an absolutely unfailing  and instantaneous remedy for the distressing complaint from which you  are suffering, and the moment that you have swallowed it every trace of  discomfort will disappear, to return no more.  You will feel so  thoroughly well that very probably you will wish to rise and dress; but  I do not advise that.  On the contrary, I recommend you to remain where  you are until you have had a few hours' refreshing sleep, after which  you can get up to dinner.  That is right,\"--as the patient swallowed the  draught.  \"Now you feel quite all right, don't you?  Yes.  You will feel  very sleepy presently; just let yourself go; and when you awake you will  find yourself as well as you ever were in your life.\"    And, incredible though it may appear, that is precisely what happened.  What was perhaps at least equally remarkable was that, although these  good people had all suffered more or less from seasickness every day  since leaving Gravesend, from that moment they were entirely free from  it for the remainder of the voyage.    Among the passengers who were thus suddenly and completely cured was a  Mr Philip Grosvenor, who, having been crossed in love, and, moreover,  possessing far more money than he knew what to do with, while he had no  disposition to dissipate it on the racecourse or at the gambling tables,  was going out to South Africa to shoot big game; and this young man--he  was only a month or two over twenty-six years of age--at once struck up  a warm friendship with Dick, originating, possibly, in a feeling of  gratitude for his prompt relief from those sufferings which had hitherto  made his life a burden to him, from the moment when the South Foreland  light had sunk beneath the horizon astern of the _Concordia_.    He made his first advances after dinner on the evening of the day which  had witnessed his cure.  As Dick had foretold, he fell asleep  immediately after swallowing the draught which the young medico had  administered, had awakened, feeling absolutely well, just in time to  rise and dress for dinner, had partaken of a very hearty meal, and  thereafter had made his way up on the poop to gaze upon the stirring  spectacle of the ship battling with and gallantly holding her own  against the raging wind and sea--and possibly also to revel in his new-  found immunity from the horrors of _mal de mer_.  Here he had found  Dick, a born sailor, walking the heaving and plunging deck and chatting  animatedly with Mr Sutcliffe, who, honest man, felt somewhat at a loss  to determine precisely the manner of his behaviour toward the youngster  whom he had so recently patronised and ordered about, but who was now  translated aft to the quarterdeck upon an equal footing with himself.  Dick had just about succeeded in putting to flight the worthy chief  mate's feeling of awkwardness and embarrassment when Grosvenor appeared  and joined the pair, whereupon Sutcliffe, who was rather shy with the  passengers, sheered off, upon the pretence of attending to his duty, and  left the two together.    \"By Jove, Doctor, but this is a grand sight, isn't it?\" exclaimed Dick's  recent patient.  \"Never saw the like of it before, and shouldn't be in  form to see it now, but for you.  'Pon my word, you know, you are a  wonder--a perfect wonder!  Give me your arm and let's walk about a bit,  shall we?  That's right.  D'you know I don't think I ever felt more fit  in my life than I do at this moment; and to reflect that only this  morning I was--ugh!  Tell you what it is, Doctor, you should patent that  prescription of yours, have it made up, and sell it at five shillings  the bottle.  You would soon make your fortune.  And I'll write a  testimonial for you.  `Took one dose and never needed another!' eh?  No,  hang it all, that wouldn't do, either, rather too ambiguous, eh? sort of  double meaning in that kind of statement--what?  But, joking apart, old  man, I'd very strongly advise you to patent the thing and advertise it  extensively.  I'm certain that there's money in it.\"    \"Possibly,\" agreed Dick, who had no intention of taking this young man  into his confidence to the extent of explaining the actual character of  the draught.  \"Unfortunately, however, to do as you suggest needs the  preliminary expenditure of a good deal of money, which is a singularly  scarce commodity with me.  No, I am afraid that plan of yours will  scarcely do; it is true that I am particularly anxious to make my  fortune, and that, too, without a moment's loss of time, but I am afraid  I shall have to hit upon some other way of doing it.\"    \"Ah!  Well, what is your plan, if it is a fair question?  Excuse me, old  chap, I'm not asking out of mere vulgar, impertinent curiosity, but at  the dinner table to-night somebody mentioned that you are working your  passage out to South Africa.  What do you propose to do when you arrive  there?\"    \"Heaven only knows; certainly I do not,\" answered Dick with a lugubrious  smile.  \"When I step ashore on the wharf at Port Natal I shall not know  in what direction to turn my steps, or where to look for a meal or a  night's lodging.  Also the whole of my available capital will consist in  the wages which I shall take up when Captain Roberts gives me my  discharge, amounting, probably, to a couple of shillings.\"    \"What?\" ejaculated Grosvenor incredulously.  \"Oh, I say, my dear chap,  you are not in earnest, surely?\"    \"Indeed I am, then, in deadly earnest,\" answered Dick.  \"But I am not  worrying.  I am strong and more than willing to work, and I mean to take  the very first job that comes to hand, let it be what it will.  I  believe that if a chap is willing to work he can always get something to  do, though it may not be precisely the kind of work that he would like.  And when once I have secured the means of providing myself with board  and lodging I shall be able to look round for something better.\"    \"Yes--yes, of course you will,\" responded Grosvenor, a little dubiously.  \"I say, old chap,\" he continued admiringly, \"you are a `gritty' beggar,  and no mistake!  I wonder if you would mind telling me your story?\"    \"No, not at all,\" answered Dick; \"there is nothing in it that I need be  ashamed of.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#9)"],[1,"hand  remain in each boat as boat-keeper, who must crouch down under the  shelter of the wharf face.  Mr Fortescue, stick close alongside me,  please; I shall probably want you to carry messages for me.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" I answered; and the next moment the voice of the coxswain  pealed out: \"Oars! rowed of all!\" followed by the clatter of the long  ash staves as they were laid in on the thwarts, and the gig, still  leading the other boats, swept up alongside the low wharf and hooked on.    With a yell of fierce delight, and eyes blazing with excitement, Cupid,  the Krooboy, bounded up on the wharf, and extended one great black paw  to assist the skipper, while in the other he grasped his favourite  weapon, an axe, the edge of which he had carefully ground and honed  until one could have shaved with it; in addition to which he wore a  ship's cutlass girded about his waist.  Moreover he had \"cleared for  action,\" by stripping off the jacket and shirt which he usually wore,  and stowing them carefully away in the stern-sheets of the boat; so that  his garb consisted simply of a pair of dungaree trousers rolled up above  his knees and braced tight to his waist by the broad belt from which  hung his cutlass.    In a second the gig was empty save for her boat-keeper, and her crew  were racing for the shelter afforded by the barracoon, where, as I  understood it, the captain intended to announce his arrangements for  clearing the enemy out of the bush.  But when we had accomplished about  half the distance between the edge of the wharf and the barracoon there  came a sudden splutter of fire from the windows of the other buildings--  which were so arranged as to enfilade the whole of the open space--and  in a moment we once more found ourselves in the midst of a storm of  flying bullets.  The skipper, who was a pace ahead of me, stumbled,  staggered a pace or two, and fell headlong upon his face, where he lay  still, while his sword flew from his grasp with a ringing clatter.  At  the same moment the two cutters dashed up alongside the wharf, and their  crews came swarming up out of them, to be met by another murderous  discharge from the enemy lurking in the bush.    I came to a halt beside the skipper, and looked round me.  A couple of  yards away stood Cupid, who, it seemed, had just caught sight of the  captain as he fell, and had pulled himself up short.    \"You, Cupid,\" I shouted, \"come back here, sir, and lend me a hand to get  the captain back into the gig.\"    The fellow came, and stooping over the skipper's body raised it tenderly  in his arms.    \"All right, Mistah Fortescue, sar,\" he said; \"you no trouble.  I take  dem captain back to de gig by myself, and find Mistah Hutchinson,\" (the  surgeon).  \"But it no good, sar; he gone dead.  Look dere.\"  And he  pointed to a ghastly great hole in the side of the skipper's head, just  above the left ear, where a piece of langrage of some description had  crashed its way through the poor fellow's skull into his brain.  It was  a horrid sight, and it turned me quite sick for the moment, accustomed  though I was by this time to see men suffering from all sorts of  injuries.    \"Very well,\" I said; \"take it--the captain, I mean--back to the gig,  anyway, and do not leave him until you have turned him over to Mr  Hutchinson; who, by the way, is in the launch, which I see is just  coming alongside.  I will find Mr Hutchinson and send him to you.\"  And  away I hurried toward the spot where I saw the launch approaching, for  the double purpose of reporting to Mr Perry the news of the captain's  fall, and dispatching the surgeon to see if life still remained in the  body.    The first luff was terribly shocked at the news which I had to tell him;  from a distance he had seen the skipper fall, but had hoped that it was  a wound, at most.  But this was not the moment for unavailing regrets;  the fall of the captain at once placed Perry in command and made him  responsible for the fate of the expedition.  He therefore gave orders  for the guns which were mounted in the bows of the launch, pinnace, and  first and second cutters to be cast loose and landed, the men not  engaged in this work being placed under the command of the third  lieutenant, with instructions to load their muskets and keep up a  constant fire upon the windows of the various buildings.  Then, as soon  as the guns were landed, two of them were loaded with double charges of  grape, for the purpose of clearing the bush of the hidden foe, while the  remaining two were double shotted and then run close up to the  barricaded doors of the buildings, which were thus blown in, one after  the other.  As each door was blown in the building to which it belonged  was stormed; the enemy, however, contriving to effect an exit by the  rear as our lads poured in at the front.  In ten minutes the whole of  the buildings were ours, without further casualties on our side; after  which we set them on fire and, waiting until they were well alight,  retired in good order to the boats, in which we hauled off far enough to  enable us to effectively cover the burning buildings with our musketry  fire and thus defeat any attempt to extinguish the flames.  An hour  later the entire settlement was reduced to a heap of smouldering ashes;  whereupon we pulled away round to the main stream once more by way of  the back of the island, in search of further possible barracoons, but  found none.    Our loss in this affair, considering its importance, was comparatively  slight, amounting as it did to two killed--of whom one was the skipper--  and seven wounded.  But we were a sorrowful party as we left the lagoon  behind us and found ourselves once more in the main stream and on our  way back to the ship; for Captain Harrison was beloved by everybody,  fore and aft, and we all felt that we could better have spared any one  else than him.        CHAPTER FOUR.    THE WRECK OF THE PSYCHE.    Our journey down the river was a very different affair from that of our  upward passage; for whereas in the latter we had been compelled to force  our way against an adverse current, we now had that current favouring  us; thus it came about that although the sun had passed the meridian  when the boats emerged from the Camma Lagoon, after destroying the slave  factory therein, it yet wanted an hour to sunset when the gig, still  leading the rest of the flotilla, entered the last reach of the river  and we once more caught sight and sound of the breakers beyond the bar.    Mr Perry, the late first lieutenant, who now, by the death of Captain  Harrison, had automatically become acting captain of the _Psyche_, had  turned over the command of the launch to the master's mate, for the  return passage, and was in the gig with me; and as we drew nearer to the  river's mouth I noticed that he rose in the stern-sheets of the boat and  glanced somewhat anxiously to seaward.  For a full minute or more he  stood gazing under the sharp of his hand out across the sandbank as it  seemed to glide rapidly past us, its summit momentarily growing lower as  the gig swept along toward the point where the dwindling spit plunged  beneath the surface of the water, and, as he gazed, the expression of  puzzlement and anxiety on his face rapidly intensified.  By this time,  too, his action and attitude had attracted the attention of those in the  boats astern, and, glancing back at them, I saw that Nugent, in the  launch, and Hoskins, the third lieutenant, in the pinnace, had followed  his example.  Naturally, I did the same, wondering meanwhile what it was  at which they were all looking so intently, when Mr Perry suddenly  turned upon me and demanded, almost angrily--    \"I say, Mr Fortescue, what has become of the ship?  D'ye see anything  of her?\"    \"The ship, sir?\"  I echoed dazedly--for, with the question, it had come  to me in a flash that we ought by this time to be able to see at least  the spars of the _Psyche_ swaying rhythmically athwart the sky out over  the low sandbank, if she still lay at anchor where we had left  her;--\"the ship?  No, sir, I confess that I can't see her anywhere.  Surely Mr Purchase cannot have shifted his berth, for any reason?  But--no,\" I continued, as the absurdity of the suggestion came home to  me--\"of course he hasn't; he hasn't enough hands left with him to make  sail upon the ship, even if he were obliged to slip his cables.\"    At that moment a hail of \"Gig ahoy!\" came from Nugent aboard the launch;  and, glancing back at him, we saw him pointing at some object that had  suddenly appeared on the ridge of the spit, away on our port quarter.  It was a man, a white man, a seaman, if one might judge from his  costume, and he was waving a large coloured handkerchief, or something  of the kind, with the evident object of attracting our attention.  While  we still stood at gaze, wondering what this apparition could possibly  mean, another man appeared beside him.    \"Down helm, and run the boat in on the bank,\" ordered our new skipper.  \"I must see what this means.\"    \"Flatten in, fore and aft, and stand by to let run your halyards!\"  ordered the coxswain, easing his helm down; and as he spoke I stepped  upon the stern thwart with the object of getting a somewhat more  extended view over the sandbank.  But there was nothing to be seen--  stay! why was the spray from the surf flying so much higher in one  particular spot than elsewhere?  And that spot appeared to be about  abreast of that part of the bank where the two men were standing.  I  stood a moment or two longer, seeking an explanation of the phenomenon,  and then fell headlong over the man who was sitting upon the aftermost  thwart gathering in the slack of the mainsail as the yard came down; for  at that moment the gig grounded on the bank and shot a quarter of her  length high and dry with the way that she had on her.  As I picked  myself up, rubbing my barked elbows ruefully, to the "]]]
