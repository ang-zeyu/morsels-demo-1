In 1704,  Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of L11,459; in  1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to L507,909. In short,  Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,  amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the  colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were  indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.    =Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made  overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and  harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the  colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in  the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for  goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little  sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,  domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,  or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up  the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange  the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.  Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New  England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,  leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut  shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to  Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.    =Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry  there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers  which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole  British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such  ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are  mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among  these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,  and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the  Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with  somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the \"commercial capital of  Connecticut and old East Jersey,\" was slightly smaller than Boston, but  growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South  Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a  center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population  of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as \"considerable  towns.\" In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in  Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and  increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the  seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,  Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a  dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county  seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,  and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the  sessions of the court.    The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of  proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one  thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and  artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising  from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,  gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market  places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and  laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main  currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and  independence.      =References=    J.

Chapter III    SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS      Colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left  scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was  little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to  schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long  and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that  delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the  intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic  efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane  of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests  those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the  thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with  England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,  political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy  itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American  intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the  writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to  Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,  Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,  and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was  something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and  power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the  process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is  evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her  husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,  the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British  propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.      THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES    In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high  importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the  colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse  had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all  the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only  class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached  on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of  local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of  which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They  wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the  colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the  Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces  the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans  were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their  authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of  sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in  all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in  time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.    =The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English  system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were  prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the  governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. \"The  Established Church,\" says Lodge, \"was one of the appendages of the  Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,  and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the  planter who built and managed it.\" As in England, Catholics and  Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only  slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#9)"],[1,"boys of the age of ten or more to do  such work. The Poor Law Guardians of the time used to send children  into the mines at the age of seven as a means of finding employment  for them. The hours of work were limited to ten daily and fifty-eight  each week.    Little or no attempt was made in the Bill to give children the means  of obtaining a good education, although considerably more than half  the children in the country never went to school at all, and many  large towns were without a proper school.    By a previous Factory Act of 1834 all children under fourteen years  of age were compelled to attend school for two hours daily. The  employer was allowed to deduct one penny a week from the child's wages  to pay the teacher. This proved absolutely useless, as the masters  employed worn-out workers as teachers, and in consequence the  children learnt nothing at all.    It was not until the year 1870 that a Bill was passed in Parliament  to create an adequate number of public elementary schools for every  district in the kingdom. To show the increase in the number of schools  built, there were in the year 1854, 3825, and in the year 1885,  21,976.    But the children of England owe almost as much to Charles Dickens  as they do to Lord Shaftesbury. He was almost the first, and certainly  the greatest, writer who, with a heart overflowing with sympathy for  little children, has left us in his books a gallery of portraits which  no one can ever forget.    He himself, \"a very small and not over-particularly-taken-care-of  boy,\" passed through a time of bitter poverty, and his stay at school,  short as it was, was not a period of his life upon which he looked  back with any pleasure.    The material for his books was drawn from life--from his own and from  the lives of those around him--and for this reason all that he wrote  will always be of great value, as it gives us a good idea of the Early  and Mid Victorian days.    His ambition was to strike a blow for the poor, \"to leave one's hand  upon the time, lastingly upon the time, with one tender touch for  the mass of toiling people.\"    Who can ever forget in the _Christmas Carol_ the crippled Tiny Tim,  \"who behaved as good as gold and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful,  sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever  heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in  the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to  them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk, and  blind men see.\"    Other pictures of suffering childhood are 'Little Nell' and 'The  Marchioness' in _The Old Curiosity Shop_, 'Jo' and 'Charley' in  _Bleak House_, and 'Smike,' the victim of the inhuman schoolmaster  'Squeers.'    The cruelty of the times is shown in the case of an unfortunate  sempstress who tried to earn a living by making shirts for  three-halfpence each. Once, when she had been robbed of her earnings,  she tried to drown herself. The inhuman magistrate before whom she  was brought told her that she had \"no hope of mercy in this world.\"    It was after hearing of this from Charles Dickens that Thomas Hood  wrote the well-known \"Song of the Shirt\":          Work--work--work!      From weary chime to chime,        Work--work--work      As prisoners work for crime!        Band, and gusset, and seam,        Seam, and gusset, and band,      Till the heart is sick, and the brain benumbed,        As well as the weary hand.    The age might well take to heart the lesson taught by the great-souled  writer--that the two chief enemies of the times were Ignorance and  Want.    The lot of the unfortunate children in the Union Workhouses was no  better. They were treated rather worse than animals, with no sympathy  or kindness, owing to the ignorance of those who were set in authority  over them. Any one who reads _Oliver Twist_ may learn the nature of  the life led by the 'pauper' children in those 'good old days.'    \"The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men;  and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they  found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have  discovered--the poor people liked it! It was a regular place of  public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there  was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all  the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play  and no work. 'Oho!' said the board, looking very knowing, 'we are  the fellows to set this to rights; we'll stop it all, in no time.'  So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the  alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they) of being starved  by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With  this view, they contracted with the waterworks to lay on an unlimited  supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small  quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day,  with an onion twice a week, and half a roll on Sundays. . . . Relief  was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened  people.\"    A movement which helped, possibly far more than any other, to better  the lot of the children of the Poor commenced with the foundation  of the Ragged School Union, of which the Queen became the patroness.    Out of this sprang a small army of agencies for well-doing.  Commencing only with evening schools, which soon proved insufficient,  the founders established day schools, with classes for exercise and  industrial training: children were sent to our colonies where they  would have a better chance of making a fair start in life; training  ships, cripples' homes, penny banks, holiday homes followed, and  from these again the numerous Homes and Orphanages which entitle us  to call the Victorian Age the Age of Kindness to Children.    Charles Dickens took the keenest interest in the work of the Ragged  Schools. A letter from Lord Shaftesbury quoted in his Life gives a  clear idea of the marvellous work they had accomplished up to the  year 1871:    \"After a period of 27 years, from a single school of five small  infants, the work has grown into a cluster of some 300 schools, an  aggregate of nearly 30,000 children, and a body of 3000 voluntary  teachers, most of them the sons and daughters of toil. . . . Of more  than 300,000 children, which, on the most moderate calculation, we  have a right to conclude have passed through these schools since  their commencement, I venture to affirm that more than 100,000 of  both sexes have been placed out in various ways--in emigration, in  the marine, in trades and in domestic service. For many consecutive  years I have contributed prizes to thousands of the scholars; and  let no one omit to call to mind what these children were, whence they  came, and whither they were going without this merciful intervention.  They would have been added to the perilous swarm of the wild, the  lawless, the wretched, and the ignorant, instead of being, as by  God's blessing they are, decent and comfortable, earning an honest  livelihood, and adorning the community to which they belong.\"    Dickens believed, first of all, in teaching children cleanliness and  decency before attempting anything in the form of education. \"Give  him, and his,\" he said, \"a glimpse of heaven through a little of its  light and air; give them water; help them to be clean; lighten the  heavy atmosphere in which their spirits flag and which makes them  the callous things they are . . . and then, but not before, they will  be brought willingly to hear of Him whose thoughts were so much with  the wretched, and who had compassion for all human sorrow.\"          CHAPTER VIII: _Ministering Women_        Honour to those whose words or deeds      Thus help us in our daily needs;        And by their overflow        Raise us from what is low!                              LONGFELLOW      No account of the reign of Queen Victoria would be complete without  some reference to the achievements of women, more especially when  their work has had for its chief end and aim the alleviation of  suffering. Woman has taken a leading part in the campaign which has  been and is now being ceaselessly carried on against the forces of  sin, ignorance, and want.    In the early years of Victoria's reign the art of sick-nursing was  scarcely known at all. The worst type of nurse is vividly pictured  for us by Charles Dickens in _Martin Chuzzlewit_:    \"She was a fat old woman, this Mrs Gamp, with a husky voice and a  moist eye, which she had a remarkable power of turning up, and only  showing the white of it. Having very little neck, it cost her some  trouble to look over herself, if one may say so, at those to whom  she talked. She wore a very rusty black gown, rather the worse for  snuff, and a shawl and bonnet to correspond. In these dilapidated  articles of dress she had, on principle, arrayed herself, time out  of mind on such occasions as the present; . . . The face of Mrs  Gamp--the nose in particular--was somewhat red and swollen, and it  was difficult to enjoy her society without becoming conscious of a  smell of spirits.\"    For a long time, though it had been recognized that the care of the  sick was woman's work, no special training was required from those  undertaking it. Florence Nightingale did away with all such wrong  ideas. In a letter on the subject of training she wrote: \"I would  say also to all young ladies who are called to any particular vocation,  qualify yourselves for it, as a man does for his work. Don't think  you can undertake it otherwise. . . . If you are called to man's work,  do not exact a woman's privileges--the privilege of inaccuracy,  of weakness, ye muddle-heads. Submit yourselves to the rules of  business, as men do, by which alone you can make God's business  succeed; for He has never said that He will give His success and His  blessing to"]]]
