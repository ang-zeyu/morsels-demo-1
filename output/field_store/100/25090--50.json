[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#9)"],[1," composers are beginning to consider it  incumbent on them to write their own librettos; and, what is more  remarkable, if we examine biographies of musicians carefully we find  that, even _before_ Wagner, not a few composers assisted in the  preparation of their operatic texts; and this remark applies even to  some of the Italian composers, who were proverbially careless  regarding their librettos. Rossini was, perhaps, too indolent to  devote much attention to his texts, and he was apt to postpone even  the _musical_ work to the last moment, so that he sometimes had to be  locked up in his room by his friends, to enable him to finish his  score by the date named in his contract. Yet it is worthy of note that  during the composition of what Rossini's admirers commonly regard as  his best and most characteristic work--the \"Barber of Seville\"--he  lived in the same house with his librettist. \"The admirable unity of  the 'Barber,' in which a person without previous information on the  subject could scarcely say whether the words were written for the  music or the music for the words, may doubtless,\" as Mr. Sutherland  Edwards suggests, \"in a great measure be accounted for by the fact  that poet and musician were always together during the composition of  the opera; ready mutually to suggest and to profit by suggestions.\"    \"Donizetti,\" the same writer informs us, while at the Bologna Lyceum,  \"occupied himself not only with music, but also with drawing,  architecture, and even poetry; and that he could turn out fair enough  verses for musical purposes was shown when, many years afterward, he  wrote--so rapidly that the word 'improvise' might here be used--for  the benefit of a manager in distress, both words and music of a little  one-act opera, called 'Il Campanello' founded on the 'Sonnette de  Nuit' of Scribe. Donizetti also arranged the librettos of 'Betty' and  'The Daughter of the Regiment,' and of the last act of 'Lucia' he not  only wrote the words but designed the scenes.\"    Concerning Verdi, Arthur Pougin says: \"It is not generally known that,  virtually, Verdi is himself the author of all his poems. That is to  say, not only does he always choose the subject of his operas, but, in  addition to that, he draws out the sketch of the libretti, indicates  all the situations, constructs them almost entirely as far as regards  the general plan, brings his personages and his characters on the  stage in such a way that his _collaborateur_ has simply to follow his  indications to bring the whole together, and to write the verses.\"    One of Verdi's poetic assistants was Francesco Piave, who supplied the  verses for \"La Traviata,\" \"Ernani\" and several other of his operas. He  was, Pougin informs us, \"a tolerably bad poet, quite wanting in  invention,\" but he had the most important quality (from Verdi's point  of view) \"of effacing himself completely, of putting aside every kind  of personal vanity and of following entirely the indications and the  desires of the composer, cutting out this, paring down that,  shortening or expanding at the will of the latter--giving himself up,  in short, to all his exigencies, whatever they might be.\"    A question having arisen some years ago, as to the origin of the  libretto of \"Aida,\" the author of it, M. du Locle, wrote to a Roman  paper that the first idea of the poem belongs to the celebrated  Egyptologist, Mariette Bey. He adds: \"I wrote the libretto, scene by  scene, phrase by phrase, in French prose, at Busseto, under the eye of  the maestro, who took a large share in the work. The idea of the  finale of the last act, with its two stages, one above the other,  belongs especially to him.\"    The libretto for Verdi's last work, \"Otello,\" was prepared by Boito,  who had previously assisted him in rearranging his \"Simon Boccanegra,\"  and who also wrote the poem of \"La Gioconda\" for Ponchielli. Boito is  a thorough believer in Wagner's doctrine that every composer should  write his own opera books, and he followed this rule in his  interesting opera \"Mefistofele.\"    Mozart was altogether too careless in accepting librettos unworthy of  his genius. Yet occasionally he took the liberty to improve the stuff  that was submitted to him. As the learned librarian, Herr Pohl,  remarks, \"In the 'Entfuehrung' it is interesting to observe the  alterations in Bretzner's libretto which Mozart's practical  acquaintance with the stage has dictated, to the author's great  disgust. Indeed, _Osmin_, one of the most original characters, is  entirely his own creation, at Fischer's suggestion.\"    Weber resembled Wagner, among other things, in the habit of carrying  plans for operas in his head for many years. Thus we read that while  on the look out for a subject for an opera he and Dusch hit upon \"Der  Freischuetz,\" a story by Apel, then just published. At the time,  however, it did not get beyond the beginning; and not till seven years  later did Weber begin the work which made his reputation, a work which  in Dresden, where it was first produced, has had already more than a  thousand performances, and which even in London was at one time  played simultaneously at three theatres. When he finally did begin his  work on the \"Freischuetz\" the libretto he used was by another author,  Herr Kind, a man of considerable dramatic ability, but who--perhaps  for that very reason--was subsequently so mortified by the fact that  Weber's superior genius caused his music to receive the lion's share  of the public's attention, that he refused to write another libretto  for him. This was unfortunate, for, as ill luck would have it, Weber  fell into the hands of a Leipsic blue stocking, Wilhelmine von Chezy,  whose literary gifts were not of the most brilliant order. She  submitted several subjects to him, from which he selected \"Euryanthe;\"  but her sketch proved so unsatisfactory that he altered it entirely  and compelled her to work it over nine times before he was  sufficiently satisfied with it to set it to music. The libretto for  his last opera, \"Oberon,\" was prepared for him in London, but the  subject, as usual, was his own choice and was based on Wieland's  famous poem of that name. Weber's rare artistic conscientiousness is  indicated by the fact that at this time, although he felt that his end  was approaching, he set to work to learn the English language in order  to avoid mistakes in adapting his melodies to the accent of the words  and the spirit of the text.    Having now caught a glimpse of the manner in which the great  composers find subjects for their operas, and elaborate them, with or  without the assistance of poets, we may go on to consider the sources  of the musical inspiration which provides appropriate melodies and  harmonies for these texts. Experience shows conclusively that the most  powerful stimulant of the composer's brain is _the possession of a  really poetic and dramatic text_. To take only one instance--it surely  cannot be a mere coincidence that the best works of four great  composers--Spohr, Berlioz, Gounod, and Schumann, are based on the  story of \"Faust.\" And Schumann, in one of his private letters,  indicates very clearly why his \"Faust\" is such an inspired  composition. Speaking of a performance of this work he says: \"It  appeared to make a good impression--better than my 'Paradise and  Peri'--no doubt in consequence of the superior grandeur of the poem  which aroused _my_ powers also to a greater effort.\"    More significant still are the words which Weber wrote to Fran von  Chezy when she was writing the libretto for \"Euryanthe;\" which he  intended to make better than all his previous works. \"When you begin  to elaborate the text,\" he wrote; \"I entreat you by all that is sacred  to task me with the most difficult kinds of metre, unexpected rhythms,  etc., which will force my thoughts into new paths and draw them out of  their hiding-places.\"    In one of his theoretical essays, Wagner emphasizes the value of a  good poem in kindling the spark of inspiration in a composer's mind by  exclaiming: \"Oh, how I adore and honor Mozart because he found it  impossible to compose for his 'Titus' as good music as for his 'Don  Juan,' or for his 'Cosi fan Tutte' as good music as for 'Figaro.'\"  Mozart, he adds, always wrote music, but _good_ music he could only  write when he was inspired, and when this inspiration was supplied by  a subject worthy of being wedded to his muse.    No doubt Wagner was right in maintaining that Mozart's operas contain  his best music. Where among all his purely instrumental works is  anything to be found as inspired as the music in the scenes where the  ghostly statue nods at _Don Juan_, and subsequently where it enters  his room and clutches his hand in its marble grasp? I venture to add  that even Beethoven, although he is not generally regarded as an  operatic composer _par excellence_, and although his fame chiefly  rests on his symphonies and other instrumental works, nevertheless  composed his most inspired music in connection with his one opera  \"Fidelio.\" I refer to the third \"Leonora\" overture, and to the music  in the prison scene, where the digging of the grave is depicted in the  orchestra with a realism worthy of Wagner, and where the music when  _Leonora_ levels her pistol at the villain reaches a climax as  thrilling as is to be found in any dramatic work, musical or literary.  Obviously, it was the intensely dramatic situation which here inspired  Beethoven to the grandest effort of his genius.    It has often been asserted that the best numbers in \"Fidelio\" were  directly inspired in Beethoven by the emotional exaltation resulting  from one of his unhappy love affairs. Mr. Thayer doubts this story,  because he could not find anything in Beethoven's sketch-books  corroborating it; but even if it should be a myth, there are many well  authenticated facts which show that Beethoven, like other composers,  owed many of his best"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#9)"],[1," herds  were driven through, and general hilarity reigned. Many points of  detail might be noticed, such as that in the urban counterpart of the  festival, which Ovid carefully distinguishes from the country  celebrations, the fire was sprinkled with the ashes from the calves of  the Fordicidia and the blood of Mars' October horse--another link  between Mars and agriculture. But it is most interesting to note the  double character of the ceremony--as a purification of man and beast on  the one hand, and on the other a prayer for the prosperity of the  season to come. Three special festivals remain in April. At the Vinalia  (_priora_) of the 23rd, the wine-skins of the previous year were opened  and the wine tasted, and, we may suppose, supplication was made for  the vintage to come, the festival being dedicated to the sky-god,  Iuppiter. At the Robigalia of the 25th the offering of a dog was made  for the aversion of mildew (_robigo_), to Robigus (who looks like a  developed eponymous deity) at the fifth milestone on the Via  Claudia--the ancient boundary of Roman territory. The Floralia of the  28th does not occur in the old Calendars, probably because it was a  moveable feast (_feriae conceptivae_), but it is an unmistakeable  petition to the _numen_ Flora for the blossoming of the season's  flowers.    May was a month of more critical importance for the welfare of the  crops, and therefore its festivals were mostly of a more sombre  character. The 9th, 11th, and 13th were the days set apart for the  Lemuria, the aversion of the hostile spirits of the dead, of which we  have already spoken, and a similarly gloomy character probably attached  to the Agonia of Vediovis on the 21st. But of far the greatest interest  is the moveable feast of the Ambarvalia, the great lustration of the  fields, which took place towards the end of the month: the date of its  occurrence was no doubt fixed according to the state of the crops in  any given year. As the individual farmer purified his own fields for  the aversion of evil, so a solemn lustration of the boundaries of the  state was performed by special priests, known as the Arval brethren  (_fratres Arvales_). With ceremonial dancing (_tripudium_) they moved  along the boundary-marks and made the farmer's most complete offering  of the pig, sheep, and ox (_suovetaurilia_): the fruits of the last  year and the new harvest (_aridae et virides_) played a large part in  the ceremonial, and a solemn litany was recited for the aversion of  every kind of pest from the crops. In Virgil's account the prayer is  made to Ceres, and we know that in imperial times, when the Ambarvalia  became very closely connected with the worship of the imperial house,  the centre of the cult was the earth-goddess, Dea Dia; but in the  earliest account of the rustic ceremony which we possess in Cato, Mars  is addressed in the unmistakeable character of an agricultural deity.  'Father Mars, I pray and beseech thee that thou mayest be gracious and  favourable to me, to my home, and my household, for which cause I have  ordained that the offering of pig, sheep, and ox be carried round my  fields, my land, and my farm: that thou mayest avert, ward off, and  keep afar all disease, visible and invisible, all barrenness, waste,  misfortune, and ill weather: that thou mayest suffer our crops, our  corn, our vines and bushes to grow and come to prosperity: that thou  mayest preserve the shepherds and the flocks in safety, and grant  health and strength to me, to my home, and my household.' We have  perhaps here another rustic ceremony addressed in origin to all  _numina_, whom it might concern, and, as it were, specialising itself  from time to time in an appeal to one definite deity or another, but it  is also clear evidence of an early agricultural association of Mars.  The Ambarvalia is one of the most picturesque of the field ceremonies,  and a peculiarly beautiful and imaginative description of it may be  found in the first chapter of Pater's _Marius the Epicurean_.    In June and July the farmer was waiting for the completion of the  harvest, and the great state-festivals of the period are not  agricultural.    =2. Festivals of the Harvest.=--In August the farmer's hopes are at  last realised, and the harvest is brought in. The season is marked by  two closely connected festivals on the 21st and 25th in honour of the  old divinity-pair, Consus (_condere_), the god of the storehouse and  Ops, the deity of the wealth of harvest. At the Consualia, an offering  is made by the _flamen Quirinalis_, assisted by the Vestal virgins, at  an underground altar in the Circus Maximus, specially uncovered for  the occasion: here we have probably not so much the notion of a  chthonic deity, as a relic of the simple practices of an early  agricultural age, when the crops were stored underground. The beasts  who had taken part in the harvest were released from their labours  during the day, and were decorated with flowers: the festival included  a race of mules, the regular Italian beasts of burden. Four days after  this general festivity occurred the second harvest-ceremony of the  Opiconsivia, held in the shrine (_sacrarium_) of the Regia, and  attended only by the _pontifex maximus_ and the Vestal virgins. This is  clearly the state-harvest of the regal period, the symbolic storing of  the state-crops in the sacred storehouse of the palace by the king and  his daughters. Both festivals are significant, and we shall meet with  Consus and Ops again in close connection in December. The _Portunalia_  of the 17th may have been another harvest-home, if we can believe the  old authorities, who tell us that Portunus was a 'god of doors'  (_portae_).    The _Vinalia Rustica_ of August 19 we cannot sufficiently interpret  through lack of information: it cannot, of course, have been the  festival of the vintage, for it is too early: it may have been a  propitiatory ceremony for the ripening grapes, in which case it was  probably connected with the _auspicatio vindemiae_, in which the  _flamen Dialis_ (note again the association of Iuppiter and the vine)  solemnly plucked the first grapes; or it may be a festival of wine, not  vines, in which case its main feature would most likely be the opening  of the last year's vintage.    September contains no great festival, and the harvest-season closes on  October 11 with the _Meditrinalia_--the nearest approach to a  thanksgiving for the vintage. On that day the first must of the new  vintage and the wine of the old were solemnly tasted, apparently as a  spell against disease, the worshipper using the strange formula, 'I  drink the new and the old wine, with new wine and old I heal (_medeor_)  disease.' This ceremony gave its name to the festival and was the cause  of the subsequent evolution of an eponymous deity, Meditrina, but there  is little doubt that in origin here, as in the other wine-festivals,  the deity concerned was at first Iuppiter. Among the other rustic  ceremonies of the month we may notice the festival of springs  (_Fontinalia_) on October 13: wells were decorated with garlands and  flowers flung into the waters.    =3. Festivals of the Winter.=--The winter-festivals cannot be summed up  under one general notion so easily as those of spring or summer, but  they fall fairly naturally into two groups--the festivals immediately  connected with agricultural life and those associated with the dead and  the underworld or with solemn purification. The main action of the  farmer's life during the winter is, of course, the sowing of the next  year's crop, which was commemorated in the ancient festival of the  Saturnalia on December 17. Though the Saturnalia is perhaps the most  familiar to us of all the Roman festivals, partly from the allusions in  the classics, especially in Horace, partly because it is no doubt the  source of many of our own Christmas festivities, it is yet almost  impossible now to recover anything of its original Roman character.  Greek influence set to work on it very early, identifying Saturnus with  Cronos and establishing him in a Greek temple with all the  accompaniments of Greek ritual. All the familiar features of the  festival--the freedom and license of the slaves, the giving of  presents, even the wax-candles, which are the prototype of those on our  own Christmas-tree--are almost certainly due to Greek origin. We are  left with nothing but the name Saturnus (connected with the root of  _semen_, _serere_) and the date to assure us that we have here in  reality a genuine Roman festival of the sowing of the crops. Of a  similar nature--marking, as Ovid tells us, the completion of the  sowing--was the _feriae sementivae_ or Paganalia, associated with the  earth-goddesses, Ceres and Tellus. Meal-cakes and a pregnant sow were  the offerings, the beasts who had helped in the ploughing were  garlanded, and prayer was made for the seed resting in the ground. A  curious feature of the winter worship is the repetition of festivals to  the harvest deities, Consus and Ops, separated by the same interval of  three days, on December 15 and 19: it may be that we have here an  indication of the final completion of the harvest, or, as Mr. Warde  Fowler has suggested, a ceremonial opening of the storehouses, to see  that the harvest is not rotting. Among the other country festivals of  the period we may notice that of Carmenta, on the 11th and 15th of  January: she seems to have been in origin a water-_numen_, but was  early associated with childbirth: hence the rigid exclusion of men from  her ceremonies and possibly the taboo on leathern thongs, on the ground  that nothing involving death must be used in the worship of a deity of  birth. The repetition of her festival may possibly point to separate  celebrations of the communities of Palatine and Quirinal. At this time,  too, occurred the rustic ceremonies at the boundaries (_Terminalia_)  and the offering"]]]
