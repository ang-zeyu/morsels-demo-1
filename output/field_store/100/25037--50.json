To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#9)"],[1," had no further  negotiations with the Franks, who imported wood, metal, arms, oil,  coral, wool, manufacturing and crystal wares in exchange for spices,  cotton, and sugar, the former trade relations were re-established. The  war with Cyprus continued, however; Alexandria was again threatened  and Tripoli was surprised by the Cyprian fleet, whereupon a number of  European merchants in Egypt were arrested. In the year 1370, after the  death of Peter of Lusignan, peace and an exchange of prisoners were  finally brought about. After this peace the Egyptians were able to  concentrate their whole force against Leo VI., Prince of Smaller  Armenia, who was brought as a prisoner to Cairo; and with him the  supremacy of the Christians in this land was at an end: henceforth Egypt  was ruled by Egyptian governors.    Faraj, Berkuk's son and successor, had to suffer for his father's  political mistakes. He had scarcely ascended the throne when the  Ottomans seized Derenda, Albustan, and Malatia. Preparations for war  were made, but given up again when it was seen that Bayazid could not  advance any farther south. Faraj was only thirteen years old, and all  the old intrigues amongst the emirs broke out again. In Cairo they  fought in the streets for the post of regent; anarchy and confusion  reigned in the Egyptian provinces, and the Syrians wished to revolt  against the sultan. When at last peace was re-established in Egypt, and  Syria was reduced, the latter country was again attacked by the hordes  of Tamerlane.    Tamerlane conquered the two important cities of Aleppo and Hemessa, and  Faraj's forces returned to Egypt. When the sultan's ally, Bayazid, was  defeated, Faraj concluded a peace with Tamerlane, at the price of  the surrender of certain lands. In 1405 Tamerlane died, and Faraj was  collecting troops for the purpose of recovering Syria when domestic  troubles caused him to flee from Egypt, his own brother Abd el-Aziz  heading the insurrection. In the belief that Faraj was dead, Aziz was  proclaimed his successor, but three months later Faraj was restored,  and it was not until 1412 that he was charged with illegal practices and  beheaded, his body being left unburied like that of a common malefactor.  The fact that criminal proceedings were brought against the sultan is  evidence of a great advance in the spirit of civilisation, but the  event must be regarded more as a proof of its possibility than as a  demonstration of its establishment.    [Illustration: 063.jpg MOSQUE OF BERKUK]    The Caliph El-Mustain was then proclaimed sultan, but after some months  he was dethroned and his former prime minister, Sheikh Mahmudi, took  over the reins of government (November, 1412). Although Sheikh had  obtained the throne of Egypt so easily, he experienced great difficulty  in obtaining the recognition of the emirs. Newruz, Governor of Damascus,  in league with the other governors, made a determined resistance, and  he was obliged to send a strong army into Syria to put down the rebels.  Newruz, after suffering one defeat, threw himself into the citadel of  Damascus and capitulated, when Sheikh had sworn to keep the terms of  the capitulation. Newruz's ambassadors, however, had not a sufficient  knowledge of Arabic to perceive that the oath was not binding, and  when Newruz, trusting to this oath, appeared before Sheikh, he was  immediately thrown into chains, and afterwards murdered in prison  because the cadis declared the oath was not binding. In the next year  (1415) Sheikh was obliged to make another expedition against Syria to  re-conquer some of the places of which the smaller princes had taken  possession during the civil war. One of these princes was the Prince  Muhammed of Karaman, who had taken the town of Tarsus. Sheikh was  summoned by Muhammed's own brother to overcome him, which he easily  succeeded in doing. Many other princes were forced to submit, and  finally the town of Malatia, which the Turcoman Husain had stormed, was  recaptured. The war against Husain and the Prince of Karaman was to have  been continued, but Sheikh was forced to return home, owing to a wound  in his foot. As soon as certain misunderstandings between Sheikh and  Kara Yusuf had been cleared up, another army was despatched into Asia  Minor, for Tarsus had been recaptured by the Prince of Karaman, who had  driven out the Prince of Albustan, whom Sheikh had installed. Ibrahim,  the sultan's son, took command of this army, and occupied Caasarea,  Nigdeh, and Kara-man. Whilst he was occupied in the interior of Asia  Minor, the Governor of Damascus had defeated Mustapha, son of the Prince  of Karaman, and the Prince Ibrahim of Ramadhan, near Adana, which latter  town, as well as Tarsus, he had re-conquered.    The Prince of Karaman, who now advanced against Caasarea, suffered a  total defeat. Mustapha remained on the field of battle, but his father  was taken prisoner and sent to Cairo, where he lingered in confinement  until after the death of the sultan.    [Illustration: 065.jpg THE TOMB OF BERKUK]    Once again was Syria threatened by Kara Yusuf, but he was soon forced  to return to Irak by the conspiracy of his own son, Shah Muhammed, who  lived in Baghdad. As soon as this insurrection was put down, Kara  Yusuf was obliged to give his whole attention to Shah Roch, the son of  Tamerlane, who had raised himself to the highest power in Persia, and  was now attempting to re-conquer the province of Aderbaijan. Kara Yusuf  placed himself at the head of an army to protect this province,  but suddenly died (November, 1420) on the way to Sultania, and his  possessions were divided among his four sons, Shah Muhammed, Iskander,  Ispahan, and Jihan Shah, who all, just as the descendants of Tamerlane  had done, immediately began to quarrel among themselves.    The sultan was already very ill when the news of Kara Yusufs death  reached him. The death of Ibrahim, his son, whom he had caused to be  poisoned, on his return from Asia Minor, weighed heavily upon him  and hastened his death, which took place on January 13, 1421. He  left immense riches behind him, but could not obtain a proper burial;  everything was at once seized by the emirs, who did not trouble  themselves in the least about his corpse. He had been by no means a good  sultan; he had brought much misery upon the people, and had oppressed  the emirs. But in spite of all he had many admirers who overlooked his  misdeeds and cruelty, because he was a pious Moslem; that is, he did  not openly transgress against the decrees of Islam, favoured the  theologians, and distinguished himself as an orator and poet; he also  founded a splendid mosque, a hospital, and a school for theology. His  whole life abounds in contrasts. After he had broken his oath to Newruz,  he spent several days in a cloister to make atonement for this crime,  and was present at all the religious ceremonies and dances. Although he  shed streams of blood to satisfy his avarice, he wore a woollen garment,  and bade the preachers, when they mentioned his name after that of  Muhammed, to descend a step on the staircase of the chancel. Under a  religious sultan of this stamp, the position of the non-Muhammedans was  by no means an enviable one. The Jews and Christians had to pay enormous  taxes and the old decrees against them were renewed. Not only were they  forced to wear special colours, but the length of their sleeves and  head-bands was also decreed, and even the women were obliged to wear a  distinctive costume.    [Illustration: 067.jpg A TITLE-PAGE OF THE KORAN OF THE TIME OF SHABAN]    Sheikh appointed his son Ahmed, one year old, as his successor, and  named the emirs who were to act as regents until he became of age.  Tatar, the most cunning and unscrupulous of these emirs, soon succeeded  in obtaining the supreme power and demanded homage as sultan (August  29, 1421); but he soon fell ill and died after a reign of about three  months. He, too, appointed a young son as his successor and named the  regents, but Bursbai also soon grasped the supreme power and ascended  the throne in 1422. He had of course many insurrections to quell, but  was not obliged to leave Egypt. As soon as peace was restored in Syria,  Bursbai turned his attention to the European pirates, who had long been  harassing the coasts of Syria and Egypt. They were partly Cypriots and  partly Catalonians and Genoese, who started from Cyprus and landed their  booty on this island. Bursbai resolved first to conquer this island.  He despatched several ships with this object in view; they landed at  Limasol, and, having burnt the ships in the harbour and plundered the  town, they returned home. The favourable result of this expedition much  encouraged the sultan, and in the following year he sent out a large  fleet from Alexandria which landed in Famagosta. This town soon  surrendered and the troops proceeded to plunder the neighbouring places,  and defeated all the troops which Prince Henry of Lusignan sent out  against them. When they had advanced as far as Limasol, the Egyptian  commander, hearing that Janos, the King of Cyprus, was advancing with  a large army against him, determined to return to Egypt to bring his  enormous booty into safety. In July, 1426, a strong Egyptian fleet set  out for the third time, landed east of Limasol, and took this fortress  after a few days' fighting. The Moslem army was, however, forced to  retreat. But the Cypriots scattered instead of pursuing the enemy, and  the Mamluks, seeing this, renewed their attack, slew many Christians  and took the king prisoner. The capital, Nicosia, then capitulated,  whereupon the Egyptian troops returned to Egypt with the captive king  and were received with great jubilation. The King of Cyprus, after  submitting to the greatest humiliations, was asked what ransom he could  pay. He replied that he possessed nothing but his life, and stuck to  this answer, although threatened"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#9)"],[1,"  Cave, being called by the owner as a sort of cave expert, I will       attempt to describe both the adventure and the cave just as they       were. The measurements are simply estimated, though by long       practice I have become expert in that line also, but the longest       measurement here was correctly taken by the rope used.         \"Having been invited by the Irwin brothers to come and examine and       explore a new cave they had found but had only entered and not       explored, accompanied by my eldest son, W.T. Powell, I reached the       place one warm Saturday morning. We found about twelve or fourteen       men waiting for our coming; some discussing the matter of whether       we would enter when we did come, and others who had volunteered to       work the windlass, which had been erected over the opening, by       means of which, with a one hundred foot rope, entrance was to be       made. The opening was like a small well, and situated under the       edge of an overhanging cliff of marble, and on the southeast slope       of the mountain, about one hundred and fifty feet above the bottom       of a narrow valley, and about the same distance below the top of       the mountain, which here is three hundred feet high. In order to       rig a windlass the edge of the cliff had to be broken away. The       well-like opening descended for about ten feet through strata of       flat-laying rocks that formed a roof; then all appeared to be       vacancy and a stone cast in gave back a distant sound.         \"Having first tested the air and proved it good by dropping in       blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine, a stout oak stick was       attached to the end of the rope, my son sprang astride and was       lowered to the bottom, just one hundred feet. He reported back 'All       right.' On the return of the rope I took my position on the stick       and was soon dangling in mid air. The sensation was strange and       exhilarating. Looking up I could only see the small opening I came       through, and a straggling stream of light poured down that, but on       all sides profound darkness reigned supreme. A spark-like light my       son lit, reminded me of the lost Pleiad. About twenty-five or       thirty feet from the top I caught sight of a scene that made me       call on the men at the windlass to stop.         \"This caused them to think something was going wrong and one called       out to know what was the matter: I heard him say 'He is weakening.'       I assured them everything was right only I wanted to take a view;       so they stopped. Off at a distance of perhaps twenty-five feet was       an opening about ten feet or more wide and twelve feet high. The       light from the opening struck it fairly, owing to the position of       the sun at the time. Through this opening I saw into another room,       large and magnificent. It brought to mind the White City. It was       snowy white, and thickly studded with stalactites and stalagmites       of immense size and in great numbers; some looking like spires of       numerous churches, and many connected as with a lattice-work about       the bottom. For a short time I gazed on that lovely scene, and       examined the chances to reach it, but a great gulf intervened that       we had no means of spanning, and I called to the men to lower me       down. Approaching the bottom one of the walls trended in towards me       and I stepped upon solid ground close to the wall, which half way       up seemed fifty feet away. The opening above now looked like a       small pale moon, and the next man who came dangling down to join us       looked no bigger than a toy soldier. Gradually our eyes became       accustomed to the twilight, and by the time our party was increased       to six men, I could see quite distinctly.         \"The room runs directly into the mountain and is about ninety feet       high, and where we landed it proved to be twenty feet wide. It       extended in both directions, but much the farthest towards the       right hand. The outer room is encrusted in fine white water       formations. It forms a Gothic ceiling from which hang pendant at       all places brilliant and sparkling stalactites; some being of       immense size and length, from ten to twenty-five feet. Others are       not so large but are brilliant. We created a flood of artificial       light with dozens of candles and lamps; and then and not until       then, could we see the slope and contour of the roof. A few bats       were flitting about, disturbed for the first time. To the left, a       vast white pillar extended from floor to roof. It was pure white       and about five feet in diameter all the way up. It was fluted,       fretted, draped and spangled. I never in my life saw anything more       chaste and lovely. I thought of the countless ages it must have       taken to form that monument: of the streams of clear water that had       fallen and left their calcite deposits, while it grew year after       year, age after age, century after century, in this profound       darkness, disturbed by no noises save the rhythmic sound of the       falling drops and the dull flitting of the bats, who alone were the       living witnesses of its construction. To the rear of this great       pillar the room is divided into three galleries, one above another.       With great difficulty and much danger we climbed into each of       these. The floors were all like the pillar of pure white onyx, and       extended back a distance of thirty or more feet. The floor of one       formed the roof of another. They were brilliant with hanging       pendants and the side walls were all veneered with the same white       and crystalline formation. To entirely describe them is impossible.       A day in each would still leave the observer short of words in       which to tell of the wonders.         \"Turning towards the right hand from the entrance we advance two       hundred feet up an incline of dry clay, the room widening gradually       until its width is forty feet, when we reach the top of an       elevation thirty feet above the starting point, where a sudden       steep descent brings us to a halt. A stone cast down strikes water       and the sound of a splash comes back to us. With caution we seek       our way down the hill and stand on the edge of a small lake or       pond. Suddenly my son, who is in the lead, rushes back saying:       'Look out! I put my hand on a snake.' Some of us, being armed with       hickory canes that had been thrown down, concentrated our lights       and advanced. Sure enough, there is a snake a yard long coiled up       on a section of rotten wood. It proves to be a copperhead, the most       quarrelsome and vicious snake in this country; but his nature is       changed so that he makes no effort to fight and is killed with a       blow, and is sent to be hoisted up that we may examine him in       daylight. No others were found, and probably he had fallen in at       the opening, and spent a long, weary time in expiation of his       upper-earth crimes.         \"Examining the lake we find it to be about forty feet wide and the       same long, and it fills the room from wall to wall. We cannot pass       it so must either stop or wade through. We decide to wade, and on       measuring the water find it only two or three feet deep, with a       soft clay bottom, and in many places islands of stalagmite rise       above the surface.         \"On the sides of the lake there are formations in the shape of       sofas and lounges, and they appear to be cushioned, but the       cushions are found to be hard, solid rock. As the lights advance       across the lake new wonders are revealed. Curtains and draperies       hanging from the top almost touch the water and entirely cut off       the view beyond. Passing under a curtain at one of the highest       places, we emerge from the lake, and once more on dry land, advance       up a slope. Here the water formations have taken human shapes of       all sizes and several colors now appear and help to present a chaos       of beauty.         \"Two hundred feet more and the chamber ends in a vast waterfall,       but the water has turned to stone. Above the waterfall is an       opening, but it is twenty-five feet up a smooth wall and we have no       ladder. The journey was at an end. Tired, wet and muddy, we started       on our return trip; recrossed the dark lake, and retraced our steps       to the place under the opening without realizing that we had spent       six hours under ground. While the other members of the party, and       the specimens, were being raised to the surface, the writer sought       to learn the flora and fauna of this new region. The flora is       blank. Even the white mold so common in many caves is absent; and       no fungus grows on the poles, bark and rotten wood that have at       some past time been cast in.         \"In animal life the range is greater. I have mentioned the       ever-present bats, and dozens of them were seen. There were also       small, white eyeless salamanders, small, yellow, speckled       salamanders, with signs of eyes but no sight; also a jet black       salamander, which like the rest, was blind. The bats were of two       species--the common brown bat and the larger light grey or yellow       species. But this was not the time of the year to see many bats in       caves. In the summer season most of them go out and remain until       cool weather, and then return to the caves with their young; so I       was rather surprised to see as many as we did.         \"Down comes the rope for the last time, and taking my place, I soon       feel myself spinning around and slowly rising. As I again pass the       magic city I saw going down, a stronger wish than ever takes       possession of me to go there, and I look for any"]]]
