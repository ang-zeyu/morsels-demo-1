She prayed for  strength, for guidance, and--with a remembrance of yesterday's trials--  for patience too, that she might be able to take a joke in good part,  and not value too highly her own dignity, and finally rose from her  knees in a glow of virtuous resolution.    No sooner was she out of her cubicle than the blow descended.  With the  glow of good resolution still upon her, she was tried--and fell!    Thomasina regarded her critically, and said, with a cool assurance more  maddening than downright rudeness:    \"That coiffure is very becoming, Fuzzy, but it won't do here.  Go back  to your den, and plait it in a pigtail like mine!\"    The glare of indignation, of scorn, of outraged dignity in Rhoda's eyes  was beyond description.  She straightened her back into a poker of  obstinacy, and replied--    \"I shall do no such thing!  I shall wear my hair as I choose, and as I  have always worn it.\"    \"No you won't, my dear.  Pigtails are the rule in this establishment,  and pigtails you must wear so long as you are within its walls.\"    \"If a teacher tells me to wear one, I shall obey.  If it is a rule, some  one in authority will tell me.  I won't be ordered by you.\"    There was a gasp of astonishment throughout the room, and one head after  another peered out to stare at the rebellious spirit who dared to defy  that important personage, the Head Girl.    Thomasina closed her eyes and smiled in maddening fashion.    \"That's where you make your mistake, sweet love, for it's just exactly  what you've got to do!  I'm Head Girl, and don't you forget it.  The  Queen on her throne is not more absolute than I am in this room.  If you  don't do what I tell you, it will be my painful duty to report you for  insubordination, and it is a sad thing for a girl to get a mark on her  first day.  I must trouble you for that pigtail, if you please.\"    She was speaking the truth, that was evident!  Confirmation was written  on every watching face, in every warning frown.  Rhoda's pride battled  with a sense of helplessness so acute that she had much ado not to burst  into tears on the spot.  The two girls stood confronting each other, the  new-comer flushed and quivering, like a beautiful young fury, with her  flaxen hair streaming over her shoulders, and her blue eyes sending out  sparks of fire; Thomasina composed and square, with her lips pursed up  in a good-humoured, tolerant smile.    \"Hurry up!\" she said, and Rhoda whisked round and dashed behind her  curtain, which flew out behind in an aggrieved fashion, as if unused to  be treated with such scant courtesy.  The next few moments seemed to  have concentrated in them a lifetime of bitterness.  The comb tugged  remorselessly through the curling locks, but the physical pain passed  unnoticed; it was the blow to pride which hurt--the sharp, sharp stab of  finding herself worsted, and obliged to give in to the will of another.  It was nothing at that moment that the pigtail was ugly and unbecoming;  Rhoda would have shaved her head and gone bald for ever if by this means  she could have escaped that verdict; but to appear again before all the  girls with that hateful, hateful wisp hanging down her back--she felt as  if she would die rather than do it; yet would it not be even more  degrading to wait for a summons?  She stalked forth, straight and  defiant, and was received with a bland smile.    \"Pretty fair for a first attempt.  Plait it down further next time.  I  must have my girls neat and tidy.  Now then, forward please--Right,  left! right, left!\"    The order was accompanied by a tap on the shoulder, which put the  finishing touch to Rhoda's exasperation.  She stepped into her place in  the queue, trembling from head to foot, and with a painful throbbing in  her head which was something new in her healthy experience.  Immediately  in front marched a tall, straight form, whom at first she failed to  recognise, but at the head of the staircase there came a temporary wait,  and then the head was turned towards her, and, behold, it was Dorothy  herself, pigtailed like the rest, and looking curiously reduced without  the background of hair.    \"Morning!\" she cried cheerily, and Rhoda gasped a breathless question.    \"You too!  Did she tell you?  I never heard--\"    \"Didn't give her a chance!  Heard her ordering you, and nipped mine up  in a trice.  Treat it as a matter of course, and don't seem to mind--  that's the tip!  Only get yourself disliked by making a fuss.\"    \"I know, but I _can't_ help it,\" sighed Rhoda dismally.    \"I'm not used to bullying, and it makes me wild.  My head's splitting.  I feel all churned up.\"    \"Worse troubles at sea!\" said Dorothy shortly, and after that there was  no more chance of conversation, for the queue moved on again, and they  were separated at breakfast as at dinner the night before.  Thomasina  sat opposite to Rhoda, and pressed the various dishes upon her good-  temperedly, ignoring all causes of discord, an attitude which, if she  had only known it, but added to the score against her, for pride forced  a haughty \"No, thanks,\" whilst appetite prompted \"Yes, please.\"  To sit  with empty plate, and see others feast on bread and marmalade is no  slight trial when one is fifteen and a-hungred, but no one urged Rhoda  to change her mind, or thought it possible to succeed where the Head  Girl failed.    There were no regular lessons during the morning, but a great deal of  confusing moving to and fro from one class-room to another, to go over  preliminary arrangements, and receive instructions from the mistresses.  Sometimes the new girls were ignored altogether, and then they felt  worms, and ready to sink through the earth; sometimes they were  questioned as to their attainments, and then the very walls seemed to  have ears, and their replies echoed through a deadly silence.  Dorothy  attained a fair level throughout, and reaped neither praise nor blame,  but Rhoda knew alternate rapture and despair, as Mademoiselle and  Fraulein beamed approval, and the \"class-mistress\" put up her eye-  glasses and regarded her as one might regard a wild animal at the Zoo,  upon hearing that she had \"done\" no Latin or mathematics.    \"You will not do much good at this school without them,\" she said,  severely.  \"They are the most important subjects.  I advise you to give  all the time you can spare to working them up, and to get, if possible,  some coaching during the holidays.  That is, of course, if you wish to  excel.\"    If she wished to excel!  _If_, indeed!  Did any one suppose for a moment  that Rhoda Chester would be content to remain among the rank and file?  Did they think that she could continue to be ignored, and live!  Ten  thousand times no!  \"A day would come!\" as Disraeli had said.  They  thought just now that she was nobody, but in time to come the school  would know her name, would be proud of it, would boast of it to other  schools.  Rhoda reared her head and smiled complacently, and the class-  mistress noted the action, and made a mental note that the new pupil  must be \"kept down.\"    The morning seemed very long, but it came to an end at last with a  blessed ten minutes \"off\" before preparing for dinner.  The other girls  hurried to their cubicles, but Rhoda waylaid Miss Everett in the  corridor, and appealed to her in breathless eagerness.    \"You said I was to come to you in any difficulty...  I want to know if  it is necessary for me to wear my hair like this?  I never do it at  home, and I'm sure my mother wouldn't like it.  Is it really the rule?\"    \"I'm afraid it is,\" said Miss Everett kindly.  \"You don't like it, eh?  Well, I don't wonder!  I shouldn't myself, in your place; but you see,  dear, bending over desks, and running about at games, loose hair gets in  the way, and cannot possibly be kept tidy.  It seems an arbitrary rule,  but there's reason in it, as there is in all the rules if you think them  out, and it doesn't apply to every day.  On Thursday evening we have  `Frolics,' and then you can wear it loose, and put on your prettiest  things.  There is always something going on--concerts, dances, or  theatricals--and Miss Bruce likes the girls to look bonnie and festive.  On Sundays, too, you can go back to your mop if you choose.  I hope you  will, for I like to see it.  I have a little sister with hair just like  yours.\"    She laid her hand affectionately on the curly head, and the touch of  kindliness acted as balm to Rhoda's sore heart.  Her eyes glistened with  unshed tears, and she said huskily:    \"I'll do anything _you_ tell me.  I won't mind; but that Thomasina--  she's hateful!  I can't stand being ordered about by a girl of my own  age.\"    \"Ah-h!\" cried Miss Everett, and sighed as at the recurrence of a well-  known trouble.  \"Well, you know, Rhoda, you must get over that feeling,  and conform to the rules of the school.  Thomasina is a great help to  me, and makes a capital `head girl.'  You see, dear, I have no time to  look after these details.  The girls think that they are busy, but long  after they are asleep at night I am slaving away correcting exercises.  Oh such piles of books! it makes me tired even to see them.  I'll do  what I can for you, but you mustn't expect too much; and after all, in a  week or ten days you will have mastered the rules, and the difficulty  will be over.  You wouldn't make a fuss for one week, would you?  Stay!  There is one thing I _can_ tell you now, and that is that you won't be  allowed to wear those slippers any longer.  I'll give you an order, and  you can go downstairs to the bureau and get a pair of school shoes like  the other girls wear.\"    Rhoda gasped with dismay.    \"What!  Those frightful things with square toes and no heels!  Those  awful tubs that Thomasina waddles about in!\"    Miss Everett laughed gaily.  She was only a girl herself, and she cast a  quick glance up and down the corridor to see if any one were coming"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#9)"],[1,"nook under a sloping piece of bark, to which she would  retire at times, and sitting down on the bottom of her cage in the  shadow, looked like a little grey mouse. When appetite brought her out  again, she would go to her tree-larder and pick out the choice hidden  morsels, as if they were the insects which would have been her food if  her lot had been cast amongst tree-branches instead of in a cage.    When winter began, Zoee was placed in the conservatory, where a tame  robin often came for a few hours to enjoy his daily crumbs and the  pleasant warmth of the air. Bobby was greatly puzzled at the nuthatch,  watched her hammerings from the top of the cage, walked round it,  surveying the provisions inside, and at last he made up his mind to get  in somehow and partake of the longed-for dainties. I could see quite  plainly the attraction, the hesitation, the pros and cons, and then,  finally, the resolve, and felt very curious as to how the birdish mind  would carry out its intention. There was only one place, where the bars  were rather widely apart, so that the nuthatch could have got out if she  had possessed half the wits of the robin. After a quiet survey and a few  flights backwards and forwards, Bobby saw this place, and made towards  it, sat and considered for a few seconds, and finally went in. The  nuthatch was sitting quietly under her piece of bark, and did not see  him; so he picked up the desired morsels, and, after a few minutes, went  out where it came in. These visits he repeated frequently through the  day, but once I was amused to see that he forgot \"the way out,\" and put  himself in a great fuss, realized that a cage was a prison, and flew up  and down in a fright, until by chance he saw the opening, and glided  out. At last Zoee caught him in the act of purloining her goodies, and  was most indignant. A rush at the thief, with an angry chirp, sent Bobby  flying away in ignominious haste, a wiser, but not a repentant bird; for  he continued his robberies, only with care to avoid being caught; he  ventured only a little way into the cage, ready to go out at a moment's  notice.    Zoee had a good deal of quiet humour, and was a character in her way. She  considered me very attentively one day, with a roguish look in her black  eyes, and then, going to her tree-stem larder, she pulled out a hidden  mealworm and held it up for me to see, with an evident wish that I  should know about it, and possibly with a little birdish triumph that  she possessed such delights; and then it was put back again and well  rammed into its crevice until the hungry moment should arrive. After a  few months Zoee became tame enough to be let out of her cage, and would  hop quietly about the room, and, like a small, grey-coated detective,  would peer about stealthily under tables and chairs in search of live  dainties; and extremely pretty she looked as she crept up the curtains  with jerky motions, evidently thinking they were tree-stems where, by  careful search, delightful centipedes and beetles might be found.    I do not know if naturalists have remarked that the nuthatch has a very  limited range of vision. Zoee could see nothing beyond twelve or fourteen  inches; the most tempting mealworm might lie on the floor of the cage  unnoticed if she happened to be on her tree-stem; and I have tried  bringing the insect nearer by degrees, and found that only when within a  foot of her eyes could she see it, and I fancy then only indistinctly  as she would peer about excitedly, as if uncertain what it was, until  near enough to be in the focus of clear vision, and then, by a sudden  dart, she would seize and flit away with it.    At first Zoee's roosting-place was under the curved piece of bark lying  on the floor of her cage, but after a time she took up her nightly  quarters in a small box which hooked on to the side of her cage. It was  a very cramped and uncomfortable lodging, and I wondered how she  contrived to squeeze into such a small space. It occurred to me that a  little cocoa-nut with a hole at one end would be the sort of  sleeping-chamber she would prefer, as being most like a hole in a  tree-stem, in which, probably, nuthatches roost.    An empty cocoa-nut was, therefore, provided. With birdish distrust and  caution Zoee only eyed it for some days, then perched on it; but finally  she went in, and it was amusing to see her evident delight: how she went  incessantly in and out, and turned round and round inside, and finally  sat down and remained in it for an hour or more, quite still and happy,  peering out at any one passing by, her sleek head and neck looking  remarkably like a snake, and her furtive black eye observantly watching  all that went on around her.    Her cage, when not in the conservatory, was placed on a table in the  drawing-room, close to where I was sitting, and thus she was frequently  spoken to and noticed, which is one great secret in taming birds and  animals. They soon learn to greet one with some token of recognition,  and their often solitary lives are brightened and cheered by such  companionship.    An amusing thing occurred one day while I was away from home for a few  hours. Zoee's cage had been placed in the sun, and a friend of mine,  glancing at the bird, saw her in an apparently dying state, her head  hanging on one side, the beak wide open, all the feathers ruffled, and  the whole aspect of the bird indicating the near approach of death. The  bell was rung, the servants came in, and whispered consultations were  held as to what could be done, and \"What would mistress say?\" seemed the  uppermost thought. All at once, Zoee jumped down and began a vigorous  hammering at her tree-stem, as full of life as ever, and she was at once  voted \"a little impostor.\" When I returned and heard the account, it was  easy to explain that my birdie had been enjoying a sun bath, which  always gives rise to most lackadaisical positions while the state of  dreamy absorption lasts.    The mealworms which Zoee mainly lived upon were kept in a tin  biscuit-box, which she knew well by sight, and one day, being too busy  to spare time to feed her with them, I opened her cage-door and put the  box down a little way from the cage on the floor, and placed a small log  of wood for her to descend by. Down she came, perched on the edge of the  box, looked at the layers of flannel which covered her delightful worms,  and tugged at one corner after another till she obtained her prey. After  swallowing two or three, she thought a little store might be useful, and  began taking them in her beak, and searching for some convenient  hiding-places, but as I did not desire to have the drawing-room neatly  ornamented with mealworms, I had to prevent that little design being  carried out. My tiny pet lived happily for about a year, but when the  moulting time came she grew weak and ill, and did not seem to have  strength to produce her new plumage; for, in spite of all possible care,  she drooped and died. She lives in my memory as one of the most gentle,  innocent birdies I have ever had, absolutely without temper, contented  and cheerful, a perfect pattern of industry, chipping out holes in her  log of wood, and flitting about with a happy little chirp from morning  till night, a bright example of what a cheery life may be lived, even by  a caged bird, when kindly treated and cared for thoughtfully.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    TITMICE.      I must own my strong liking for these active, saucy little birds. For  eighteen years I have always had a basket hung just outside the  dining-room window containing their favourite food, _.e._, fat of any  kind, cooked or uncooked; and most amusing it is to watch their little  odd ways and tempers whilst frequenting the said basket. Four species  thus studied showed distinct characteristics. Directly I put out a fresh  supply of fat, the Cole Tit would spend all his time and energies in  carrying it away, piece by piece, to lay by in store for the future, in  crevices in the bark of trees, and this work he would carry on with  misplaced energy until the basket was emptied. The Greater Tit and Marsh  Tit came quietly for the supply of their own personal needs, and to feed  their young in nesting time, but the Blue Tit was by far the most  amusing. His attitudes were quite a study; he seemed rather to prefer  being upside down; clinging to the basket and hammering away at the hard  fat, head downwards, was a favourite pose; then, when any one else  desired a share, he would make a stand with open beak and outspread  wings and enact \"king of the castle\" in the most impertinent manner,  considering his tiny dimensions. A guerilla warfare seems always going  on amongst these Blue Tits. If one was in the basket and remaining  perfectly still, I knew two or three others were meditating a sudden  combined assault, but it seemed as if the steady gaze of the titmouse  in possession kept them at bay for a time. At length a twittering  scrimmage ensued, and the combatants disappeared. I once coaxed a Blue  Tit to live in the dining-room for a few days, and he made himself very  happy, constantly flitting about in search of insects, running up and  down the curtains like a veritable mouse, alighting on any joint of cold  meat which happened to be on the sideboard, and making an excellent  dinner in Bohemian fashion. Of course his fearless curiosity led him  into difficulties. He would sit on the edge of a jug and peer down to  see what it might contain, and his plumage was not improved by the baths  of milk or cocoa which he met with in the pursuit of knowledge of this  kind. Some years ago an empty cocoa-husk with a hole at one end,  furnished with nesting materials, was hung up just above the basket of  fat. A large tit began to build in it, but unhappily for him a Blue Tit  had also been house-hunting, and determined to settle in it. I saw the  matter decided"]]]
