News of His death on the cross had only just reached us  when another messenger came to tell us that the sepulcher in which He  had been laid was empty; that He had risen from the dead.    \"My father's eyes kindled when he heard this message. He cast aside  his staff and stood firm on his feet. His voice, when he spoke, rang  out like a trumpet. 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel!' he cried. It  is thus that He redeemeth His people. This Jesus is not to be the  Captain of our armies, but the Savior of our souls. His kingdom is the  kingdom of righteousness, and therefore it is that the prophet hath  said: \"Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be  no end.\"    \"Always after that, words of the prophet concerning the Messiah kept  coming back to my father; and once and again he cried out: 'Truly,  this Jesus was the Son of God, the true King of Israel!' As the months  wore on, his words were more and more of the crucified and risen Lord,  and he dwelt in a great peace. At length, when the flocks were led  forth to the midwinter pasturage, he begged to go with me. It was on  this very day that we came, the same day of the year on which the Lord  was born. He was feeble and tottered as he walked; but he leaned on  my arm and we came slowly. In the evening he said: 'Let me go, my son,  and sit once more under the great rock.' I wrapped him in my coat of  skins, and sat here where I sit now and where he was sitting when the  angel came. We talked here long, under the stars, that night, of Him  whom we had learned to love as Master and Lord, of the works that He  had done and the words that He had spoken, as His disciples had told  of them. We had been silent for a few moments, when I looked up, and  saw that his head had fallen backward against the rock wall. I sprang  to him. His eyes were shut, but his lips were moving. I put my ear to  his mouth, and heard him say only: 'Peace--on--earth--good  will'--they were his last words. He had gone beyond our starlight,  into the country where the light always shines--the glory that fell  that night, fifty years ago, upon these hills of Bethlehem.\"    Stephanus was silent and Joseph's eyes were full of tears. At length  the old man rose.    \"Come, my son,\" he said. \"Cesil is in the south; it is midnight; let  us call your father and his brother. The old man and the boy have kept  their watch, and it is now time for rest.\"    [*] Used by permission of the Author.          THE STORY OF CHRISTMAS[*]    Nora A. Smith         \"A great spiritual efficiency lies in story-telling\".--_Froebel._      Christmas Day, you know, dear children, is Christ's day, Christ's  birthday, and I want to tell you why we love it so much, and why we  try to make every one happy when it comes each year.    A long, long time ago--more than eighteen hundred years--the baby  Christ was born on Christmas Day; a baby so wonderful and so  beautiful, who grew up to be a man so wise, so good, so patient and  sweet that, every year, the people who know about Him love Him better  and better, and are more and more glad when His birthday comes again.  You see that He must have been very good and wonderful; for people  have always remembered His birthday, and kept it lovingly for eighteen  hundred years.    He was born, long years ago, in a land far, far away across the seas.    Before the baby Christ was born, Mary, His mother, had to make a long  journey with her husband, Joseph. They made this journey to be taxed  or counted; for in those days this could not be done in the town where  people happened to live, but they must be numbered in the place where  they were born.    In that far-off time the only way of traveling was on a horse, or a  camel, or a good, patient donkey. Camels and horses cost a great deal  of money, and Mary was very poor; so she rode on a quiet, safe  donkey, while Joseph walked by her side, leading him and leaning on  his stick. Mary was very young, and beautiful, I think, but Joseph was  a great deal older than she.    People dress nowadays, in those distant countries, just as they did so  many years ago, so we know that Mary must have worn a long, thick  dress, falling all about her in heavy folds, and that she had a soft  white veil over her head and neck, and across her face. Mary lived in  Nazareth, and the journey they were making was to Bethlehem, many  miles away.    They were a long time traveling, I am sure; for donkeys are slow,  though they are so careful, and Mary must have been very tired before  they came to the end of their journey.    They had traveled all day, and it was almost dark when they came near  to Bethlehem, to the town where the baby Christ was to be born. There  was the place they were to stay,--a kind of inn, or lodging-house, but  not at all like those you know about.    They have them today in that far-off country, just as they built them  so many years ago.    It was a low, flat-roofed, stone building, with no windows and only  one large door. There were no nicely furnished bed rooms inside, and  no soft white beds for the tired travelers; there were only little  places built into the stones of the wall, something like the berths on  steamboats nowadays, and each traveler brought his own bedding. No  pretty garden was in front of the inn, for the road ran close to the  very door, so that its dust lay upon the doorsill. All around the  house, to a high, rocky hill at the back, a heavy stone fence was  built, so that the people and the animals inside might be kept safe.    Mary and Joseph could not get very near the inn; for the whole road in  front was filled with camels and donkeys and sheep and cows, while a  great many men were going to and fro, taking care of the animals. Some  of these people had come to Bethlehem to pay their taxes, as Mary and  Joseph had done, and others were staying for the night on their way to  Jerusalem, a large city a little further on.    The yard was filled, too, with camels and sheep; and men were lying on  the ground beside them, resting and watching and keeping them safe.  The inn was so full and the yard was so full of people that there was  no room for anybody else, and the keeper had to take Joseph and Mary  through the house and back to the high hill, where they found another  place that was used for a stable. This had only a door and front, and  deep caves were behind, stretching far into the rocks.    This was the spot where Christ was born. Think how poor a place!--but  Mary was glad to be there, after all; and when the Christ-child came,  He was like other babies, and had so lately come from heaven that He  was happy everywhere.    There were mangers all around the cave, where the cattle and sheep  were fed, and great heaps of hay and straw were lying on the floor.  Then, I think, there were brown-eyed cows and oxen there, and quiet,  woolly sheep, and perhaps even some dogs that had come in to take care  of the sheep.    And there in the cave, by and by, the wonderful baby came, and they  wrapped Him up and laid Him in a manger.    All the stars in the sky shone brightly that night, for they knew the  Christ-child was born, and the angels in heaven sang together for joy.  The angels knew about the lovely child, and were glad that He had come  to help the people on earth to be good.    There lay the beautiful baby, with a manger for His bed, and oxen and  sheep all sleeping quietly round Him. His mother watched Him and loved  Him, and by and by many people came to see Him, for they had heard  that a wonderful child was to be born in Bethlehem. All the people in  the inn visited Him, and even the shepherds left their flocks in the  fields and sought the child and His mother.    But the baby was very tiny, and could not talk any more than any other  tiny child, so He lay in His mother's lap, or in the manger, and only  looked at the people. So after they had seen Him and loved Him, they  went away again.    After a time, when the baby had grown larger, Mary took Him back to  Nazareth, and there He lived and grew up.    And He grew to be such a sweet, wise, loving boy, such a tender,  helpful man, and He said so many good and beautiful things, that  everyone who knew Him, loved Him. Many of the things He said are in  the Bible, you know, and a great many beautiful stories of the things  He used to do while He was on earth.    He loved little children like you very much, and often used to take  them up in His arms and talk to them.    And this is the reason we love Christmas Day so much, and try to make  everybody happy when it comes around each year. This is the reason;  because Christ, who was born on Christmas Day, has helped us all to be  good so many, many times, and because He was the best Christmas  present the world ever had!

THE LEGEND OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE[*]    By Lucy Wheelock      Two little children were sitting by the fire one cold winter's night.  All at once they heard a timid knock at the door, and one ran to  open it.    There, outside in the cold and the darkness, stood a child with no  shoes upon his feet and clad in thin, ragged garments. He was  shivering with cold, and he asked to come in and warm himself.    \"Yes, come,\" cried both the children; \"you shall have our place by the  fire. Come in!\"    They drew the little stranger to their warm seat and shared their  supper with him, and gave him their bed, while they slept on a hard  bench.    In the night they were awakened by strains of sweet music and,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#9)"],[1," chert, has such an outline as  Scawfell's; if of gray-wacke, as Skiddaw's; or if of slate, as  Helvellyn's; but their combinations of form are, nevertheless, felt to  be exquisite, and we dwell upon every bend of the rough roof and every  hollow of the loose wall, feeling it to be a design which no architect  on earth could ever equal, sculptured by a chisel of unimaginable  delicacy, and finished to a degree of perfection, which is unnoticed  only because it is everywhere.    [Footnote 9: Compare _Modern Painters_, vol. iv. chap. 18, Sec. 7.]    55. This ease and irregularity is peculiarly delightful where  gracefulness and freedom of outline and detail are, as they always are  in mountain countries, the chief characteristics of every scene. It is  well that, where every plant is wild and every torrent free, every field  irregular in its form, every knoll various in its outline, one is not  startled by well built walls, or unyielding roofs, but is permitted to  trace in the stones of the peasant's dwelling, as in the crags of the  mountain side, no evidence of the line or the mallet, but the operation  of eternal influences, the presence of an Almighty hand. Another  perfection connected with its ease of outline is, its severity of  character: there is no foppery about it; not the slightest effort at any  kind of ornament, but what nature chooses to bestow; it wears all its  decorations wildly, covering its nakedness, not with what the peasant  may plant, but with what the winds may bring. There is no gay color or  neatness about it; no green shutters or other abomination: all is calm  and quiet, and severe, as the mind of a philosopher, and, withal, a  little somber. It is evidently old, and has stood many trials in its  day; and the snow, and the tempest, and the torrent have all spared it,  and left it in its peace, with its gray head unbowed, and its early  strength unbroken, even though the spirit of decay seems creeping, like  the moss and the lichen, through the darkness of its crannies. This  venerable and slightly melancholy character is the very soul of all its  beauty.    56. There remains only one point to be noticed, its humility. This was  before stated to be desirable, and it will here be found in perfection.  The building draws as little attention upon itself as possible; since,  with all the praise I have bestowed upon it, it possesses not one point  of beauty in which it is not equaled or excelled by every stone at the  side of the road. It is small in size, simple in form, subdued in tone,  easily concealed or overshadowed; often actually so; and one is always  delighted and surprised to find that what courts attention so little is  capable of sustaining it so well. Yet it has no appearance of weakness:  it is stoutly, though rudely, built; and one ceases to fear for its sake  the violence of surrounding agencies, which, it may be seen, will be  partly deprecated by its humility.    57. Such is the mountain cottage of Westmoreland; and such, with  occasional varieties, are many of the mountain cottages of England and  Wales. It is true that my memory rests with peculiar pleasure in a  certain quiet valley near Kirkstone, little known to the general  tourist, distant from any public track, and, therefore, free from all  the horrors of improvement:[10] in which it seemed to me that the  architecture of the cottage had attained a peculiar degree of  perfection. But I think that this impression was rather produced by a  few seemingly insignificant accompanying circumstances, than by any  distinguished beauty of design in the cottages themselves. Their  inhabitants were evidently poor, and apparently had not repaired their  dwellings since their first erection; and, certainly, had never torn one  tuft of moss or fern from roofs or walls, which were green with the rich  vegetation of years. The valley was narrow, and quiet, and deep, and  shaded by reverend trees, among whose trunks the gray cottages looked  out, with a perfection of effect which I never remember to have seen  equaled, though I believe that, in many of the mountain districts of  Britain, the peasant's domicile is erected with equal good taste.    [Footnote 10: Troutbeck, sixty years since?]    58. I have always rejoiced in the thought, that our native highland  scenery, though, perhaps, wanting in sublimity, is distinguished by a  delicate finish in its details, and by a unanimity and propriety of  feeling in the works of its inhabitants, which are elsewhere looked for  in vain; and the reason of this is evident. The mind of the inhabitant  of the continent, in general, is capable of deeper and finer sensations  than that of the islander. It is higher in its aspirations, purer in its  passions, wilder in its dreams, and fiercer in its anger; but it is  wanting in gentleness, and in its simplicity; naturally desirous of  excitement, and incapable of experiencing, in equal degree, the calmer  flow of human felicity, the stillness of domestic peace, and the  pleasures of the humble hearth, consisting in everyday duties performed,  and everyday mercies received; consequently, in the higher walks of  architecture, where the mind is to be impressed or elevated, we never  have equaled, and we never shall equal, them. It will be seen  hereafter, when we leave the lowly valley for the torn ravine, and the  grassy knoll for the ribbed precipice, that, if the continental  architects cannot adorn the pasture with the humble roof, they can crest  the crag with eternal battlements;[11] if they cannot minister to a  landscape's peace, they can add to its terror; and it has been already  seen, that, in the lowland cottages of France and Italy, where high and  refined feelings were to be induced, where melancholy was to be excited,  or majesty bestowed, the architect was successful, and his labor was  perfect: but, now, nothing is required but humility and gentleness; and  this, which he does not feel, he cannot give: it is contrary to the  whole force of his character, nay, even to the spirit of his religion.  It is unfelt even at the time when the soul is most chastened and  subdued; for the epitaph on the grave is affected in its sentiment, and  the tombstone gaudily gilded, or wreathed with vain flowers.    [Footnote 11: This too refers to the unwritten sequel.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6. The Highest House in England.]    59. We cannot, then, be surprised at the effort at ornament and other  fancied architectural beauties, which injure the effect of the more  peaceful mountain scenery abroad; but still less should we be surprised  at the perfect propriety which prevails in the same kind of scenery at  home; for the error which is there induced by one mental deficiency, is  here prevented by another. The uncultivated mountaineer of Cumberland  has no taste, and no idea of what architecture means; he never thinks of  what is right, or what is beautiful, but he builds what is most adapted  to his purposes, and most easily erected: by suiting the building to the  uses of his own life, he gives it humility; and, by raising it with the  nearest material, adapts it to its situation. This is all that is  required, and he has no credit in fulfilling the requirement, since the  moment he begins to think of effect, he commits a barbarism by  whitewashing the whole. The cottages of Cumberland would suffer much by  this piece of improvement, were it not for the salutary operation of  mountain rains and mountain winds.    60. So much for the hill dwellings of our own country. I think the  examination of the five examples of the cottage which I have given have  furnished all the general principles which are important or worthy of  consideration; and I shall therefore devote no more time to the  contemplation of individual buildings. But, before I leave the cottage  altogether, it will be necessary to notice a part of the building which  I have in the separate instances purposely avoided mentioning, that I  might have the advantage of immediate comparison; a part exceedingly  important, and which seems to have been essential to the palace as well  as to the cottage, ever since the time when Perdiccas received his  significant gift of the sun from his Macedonian master, [Greek:  perigrapsas ton helion, hos en kata ten kapnodoken es ton oikon  esechon].[12] And then I shall conclude the subject by a few general  remarks on modern ornamental cottages, illustrative of the principle so  admirably developed in the beauty of the Westmoreland building; to  which, it must be remembered, the palm was assigned, in preference to  the Switzer's; not because it was more labored, but because it was more  natural.    OXFORD, _Jan., 1838._    [Footnote 12: Herodotus viii, 137, freely quoted from memory. The story  was that three brothers took service with a kinglet in Macedonia. The  queen, who cooked their food herself, for it was in the good old times,  noticed that the portion of Perdiccas, the youngest, always \"rose\" three  times as large as any other. The king judged this to be an omen of the  lad's coming to fortune; and dismissed them. They demanded their wages.  \"When the king heard talk about wages--you must know _the sun was  shining into the house, down the chimney_--he said (for God had hardened  his heart) 'There's your wage; all you deserve and all you'll get:' and  pointed to the sunshine. The elder brothers were dumfoundered when they  heard that; but the lad, who happened to have his knife with him, said,  'We accept, King, the gift.' With his knife he _made a scratch around  the sunstreak_ on the floor, took the shine of it three times into the  fold of his kirtle\"--his pocket, we should say nowadays--\"and went his  way.\" Eventually he became king of Macedonia, and ancestor of Alexander  the Great.]          V.
