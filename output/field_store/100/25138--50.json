Day by day this meeting will grow and become more powerful until gradually  its spirit will conquer the whole world!    Try with all your hearts to be willing channels for God's Bounty. For I  say unto you that He has chosen you to be His messengers of love  throughout the world, to be His bearers of spiritual gifts to man, to be  the means of spreading unity and concord on the earth. Thank God with all  your hearts that such a privilege has been given unto you. For a life  devoted to praise is not too long in which to thank God for such a favour.    Lift up your hearts above the present and look with eyes of faith into the  future! Today the seed is sown, the grain falls upon the earth, but behold  the day will come when it shall rise a glorious tree and the branches  thereof shall be laden with fruit. Rejoice and be glad that this day has  dawned, try to realize its power, for it is indeed wonderful! God has  crowned you with honour and in your hearts has He set a radiant star;  verily the light thereof shall brighten the whole world!          THE TWO KINDS OF LIGHT      November 5th    Today the weather is gloomy and dull! In the East there is continual  sunshine, the stars are never veiled, and there are very few clouds. Light  always rises in the East and sends forth its radiance into the West.    There are two kinds of light. There is the visible light of the sun, by  whose aid we can discern the beauties of the world around us--without this  we could see nothing.    Nevertheless, though it is the function of this light to make things  visible to us, it cannot give us the power to see them or to understand  what their various charms may be, for this light has no intelligence, no  consciousness. It is the light of the intellect which gives us knowledge  and understanding, and without this light the physical eyes would be  useless.    This light of the intellect is the highest light that exists, for it is  born of the Light Divine.    The light of the intellect enables us to understand and realize all that  exists, but it is only the Divine Light that can give us sight for the  invisible things, and which enables us to see truths that will only be  visible to the world thousands of years hence.    It was the Divine Light which enabled the prophets to see two thousand  years in advance what was going to take place and today we see the  realization of their vision. Thus it is this Light which we must strive to  seek, for it is greater than any other.    It was by this Light that Moses was enabled to see and comprehend the  Divine Appearance, and to hear the Heavenly Voice which spoke to him from  the Burning Bush.(6)    It is of this Light Muhammad is speaking when he says, 'Allah is the light  of the Heavens, and of the Earth'.    Seek with all your hearts this Heavenly Light, so that you may be enabled  to understand the realities, that you may know the secret things of God,  that the hidden ways may be made plain before your eyes.    This light may be likened unto a mirror, and as a mirror reflects all that  is before it, so this Light shows to the eyes of our spirits all that  exists in God's Kingdom and causes the realities of things to be made  visible. By the help of this effulgent Light all the spiritual  interpretation of the Holy Writings has been made plain, the hidden things  of God's Universe have become manifest, and we have been enabled to  comprehend the Divine purposes for man.    I pray that God in His mercy may illumine your hearts and souls with His  glorious Light, then shall each one of you shine as a radiant star in the  dark places of the world.          SPIRITUAL ASPIRATION IN THE WEST      'Abdu'l-Baha said:    You are very welcome! From Eastern lands I have come to the West to  sojourn awhile among you. In the East it is often said that the people of  the West are without spirituality, but I have not found it thus. Thank  God, I see and feel that there is much spiritual aspiration among the  Western peoples, and that in some cases their spiritual perception is even  keener than among their Eastern brothers. If the teaching given in the  East had been conscientiously spread in the West the world today would be  a more enlightened place.    Although in the past all the great Spiritual Teachers have arisen in the  East, there are still many men there who are quite devoid of spirituality.  With regard to the things of the spirit they are as lifeless as a stone;  nor do they wish to be otherwise, for they consider that man is only a  higher form of animal and that the things of God concern him not.    But man's ambition should soar above this--he should ever look higher than  himself, ever upward and onward, until through the Mercy of God he may  come to the Kingdom of Heaven. Again, there are men whose eyes are only  open to physical progress and to the evolution in the world of matter.  These men prefer to study the resemblance between their own physical body  and that of the ape, rather than to contemplate the glorious affiliation  between their spirit and that of God. This is indeed strange, for it is  only physically that man resembles the lower creation, with regard to his  intellect he is totally unlike it.    Man is always progressing. His circle of knowledge is ever widening, and  his mental activity flows through many and varied channels. Look what man  has accomplished in the field of science, consider his many discoveries  and countless inventions and his profound understanding of natural law.    In the world of art it is just the same, and this wonderful development of  man's faculties becomes more and more rapid as time goes on. If the  discoveries, inventions and material accomplishments of the last fifteen  hundred years could be put together, you would see that there has been  greater advancement during the last hundred years than in the previous  fourteen centuries. For the rapidity with which man is progressing  increases century by century.    The power of the intellect is one of God's greatest gifts to men, it is  the power that makes him a higher creature than the animal. For whereas,  century by century and age by age man's intelligence grows and becomes  keener, that of the animal remains the same. They are no more intelligent  today then they were a thousand years ago! Is there a greater proof than  this needed to show man's dissimilarity to the animal creation? It is  surely as clear as day.    As for the spiritual perfections they are man's birthright and belong to  him alone of all creation. Man is, in reality, a spiritual being, and only  when he lives in the spirit is he truly happy. This spiritual longing and  perception belongs to all men alike, and it is my firm conviction that the  Western people possess great spiritual aspiration.    It is my fervent prayer that the star of the East will shed its brilliant  rays on the Western world, and that the people of the West may arise in  strength, earnestness, and courage, to help their brethren in the East.          LECTURE GIVEN AT A STUDIO IN PARIS      November 6th    This is in truth a Baha'i house. Every time such a house or meeting place  is founded it becomes one of the greatest aids to the general development  of the town and country to which it belongs. It encourages the growth of  learning and science and is known for its intense spirituality and for the  love it spreads among the peoples.    The foundation of such a meeting-place is always followed by the greatest  prosperity. The first Baha'i Assembly that existed in Tihran was  singularly blessed! In one year it had grown so rapidly that its members  had increased to nine times their original number. Today, in far-away  Persia, there are many such assemblies where the friends of God meet  together in the fulness of joy, love and unity. They teach the Cause of  God, educate the ignorant, and draw heart to heart in brotherly kindness.  It is they who help the poor and needy and give to them their daily bread.  They love and care for the sick and are messengers of hope and consolation  to the desolate and oppressed.    Oh, ye in Paris, strive that your assemblies may be like unto this, and  may bear even greater fruits!    Oh, friends of God! If ye will trust in the Word of God and be strong; if  ye will follow the precepts of Baha'u'llah to tend the sick, raise the  fallen, care for the poor and needy, give shelter to the destitute,  protect the oppressed, comfort the sorrowful and love the world of  humanity with all your hearts, then I say unto you that ere long this  meeting-place will see a wonderful harvest. Day by day each member will  advance and become more and more spiritual. But ye must have a firm  foundation and your aims and ambitions must be clearly understood by each  member. They shall be as follows:    1. To show compassion and goodwill to all mankind.    2. To render service to humanity.    3. To endeavour to guide and enlighten those in darkness.    4. To be kind to everyone, and show forth affection to every living soul.    5. To be humble in your attitude towards God, to be constant in prayer to  Him, so as to grow daily nearer to God.    6. To be so faithful and sincere in all your actions that every member may  be known as embodying the qualities of honesty, love, faith, kindness,  generosity, and courage. To be detached from all that is not God,  attracted by the Heavenly Breath--a divine soul; so that the world may know  that a Baha'i is a perfect being.    Strive to attain this at these meetings. Then, indeed and in truth will  ye, the friends of God, come together with great joy! Render help one to  the other, become as one man, having reached perfect unity.    I pray to God that daily ye may advance in spirituality, that God's love  may be more and more manifested in you, that the thoughts of your hearts  may be purified, and that your faces may be ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#9)"],[1,"Persia to Ba_gh_dad, then to  Constantinople, then to Adrianople, finally from Rumelia to the prison  fortress of Akka.    During His lifetime He was intensely active. His energy was unlimited.  Scarcely one night was passed in restful sleep. He bore these ordeals,  suffered these calamities and difficulties in order that a manifestation  of selflessness and service might become apparent in the world of  humanity; that the Most Great Peace should become a reality; that human  souls might appear as the angels of heaven; that heavenly miracles would  be wrought among men; that human faith should be strengthened and  perfected; that the precious, priceless bestowal of God--the human  mind--might be developed to its fullest capacity in the temple of the body;  and that man might become the reflection and likeness of God, even as it  hath been revealed in the Bible, \"Let us make man in our image.\"    Briefly, the Blessed Perfection bore all these ordeals and calamities in  order that our hearts might become enkindled and radiant, our spirits be  glorified, our faults become virtues, our ignorance be transformed into  knowledge; in order that we might attain the real fruits of humanity and  acquire heavenly graces; in order that, although pilgrims upon earth, we  should travel the road of the heavenly Kingdom, and, although needy and  poor, we might receive the treasures of eternal life. For this has He  borne these difficulties and sorrows.    Trust all to God. The lights of God are resplendent. The blessed Epistles  are spreading. The blessed teachings are promulgated throughout the East  and West. Soon you will see that the heavenly Words have established the  oneness of the world of humanity. The banner of the Most Great Peace has  been unfurled, and the great community is appearing.          19 April 1912  Talk at Earl Hall  Columbia University, New York      From Stenographic Notes    If we look with a perceiving eye upon the world of creation, we find that  all existing things may be classified as follows: first, mineral--that is  to say, matter or substance appearing in various forms of composition;  second, vegetable--possessing the virtues of the mineral plus the power of  augmentation or growth, indicating a degree higher and more specialized  than the mineral; third, animal--possessing the attributes of the mineral  and vegetable plus the power of sense perception; fourth, human--the  highest specialized organism of visible creation, embodying the qualities  of the mineral, vegetable and animal plus an ideal endowment absolutely  absent in the lower kingdoms--the power of intellectual investigation into  the mysteries of outer phenomena. The outcome of this intellectual  endowment is science, which is especially characteristic of man. This  scientific power investigates and apprehends created objects and the laws  surrounding them. It is the discoverer of the hidden and mysterious  secrets of the material universe and is peculiar to man alone. The most  noble and praiseworthy accomplishment of man, therefore, is scientific  knowledge and attainment.    Science may be likened to a mirror wherein the images of the mysteries of  outer phenomena are reflected. It brings forth and exhibits to us in the  arena of knowledge all the product of the past. It links together past and  present. The philosophical conclusions of bygone centuries, the teachings  of the Prophets and wisdom of former sages are crystallized and reproduced  in the scientific advancement of today. Science is the discoverer of the  past. From its premises of past and present we deduce conclusions as to  the future. Science is the governor of nature and its mysteries, the one  agency by which man explores the institutions of material creation. All  created things are captives of nature and subject to its laws. They cannot  transgress the control of these laws in one detail or particular. The  infinite starry worlds and heavenly bodies are nature's obedient subjects.  The earth and its myriad organisms, all minerals, plants and animals are  thralls of its dominion. But man through the exercise of his scientific,  intellectual power can rise out of this condition, can modify, change and  control nature according to his own wishes and uses. Science, so to speak,  is the breaker of the laws of nature.    Consider, for example, that man according to natural law should dwell upon  the surface of the earth. By overcoming this law and restriction, however,  he sails in ships over the ocean, mounts to the zenith in airplanes and  sinks to the depths of the sea in submarines. This is against the fiat of  nature and a violation of her sovereignty and dominion. Nature's laws and  methods, the hidden secrets and mysteries of the universe, human  inventions and discoveries, all our scientific acquisitions should  naturally remain concealed and unknown, but man through his intellectual  acumen searches them out of the plane of the invisible, draws them into  the plane of the visible, exposes and explains them. For instance, one of  the mysteries of nature is electricity. According to nature this force,  this energy, should remain latent and hidden, but man scientifically  breaks through the very laws of nature, arrests it and even imprisons it  for his use.    In brief, man through the possession of this ideal endowment of scientific  investigation is the most noble product of creation, the governor of  nature. He takes the sword from nature's hand and uses it upon nature's  head. According to natural law night is a period of darkness and  obscurity, but man by utilizing the power of electricity, by wielding this  electric sword overcomes the darkness and dispels the gloom. Man is  superior to nature and makes nature do his bidding. Man is a sensitive  being; nature is without sensation. Man has memory and reason; nature  lacks them. Man is nobler than nature. There are powers within him of  which nature is devoid. It may be claimed that these powers are from  nature itself and that man is a part of nature. In answer to this  statement we will say that if nature is the whole and man is a part of  that whole, how could it be possible for a part to possess qualities and  virtues which are absent in the whole? Undoubtedly the part must be  endowed with the same qualities and properties as the whole. For example,  the hair is a part of the human anatomy. It cannot contain elements which  are not found in other parts of the body, for in all cases the component  elements of the body are the same. Therefore, it is manifest and evident  that man, although in body a part of nature, nevertheless in spirit  possesses a power transcending nature; for if he were simply a part of  nature and limited to material laws, he could possess only the things  which nature embodies. God has conferred upon and added to man a  distinctive power--the faculty of intellectual investigation into the  secrets of creation, the acquisition of higher knowledge--the greatest  virtue of which is scientific enlightenment.    This endowment is the most praiseworthy power of man, for through its  employment and exercise the betterment of the human race is accomplished,  the development of the virtues of mankind is made possible and the spirit  and mysteries of God become manifest. Therefore, I am greatly pleased with  my visit to this university. Praise be to God that this country abounds in  such institutions of learning where the knowledge of sciences and arts may  readily be acquired.    As material and physical sciences are taught here and are constantly  unfolding in wider vistas of attainment, I am hopeful that spiritual  development may also follow and keep pace with these outer advantages. As  material knowledge is illuminating those within the walls of this great  temple of learning, so also may the light of the spirit, the inner and  divine light of the real philosophy glorify this institution. The most  important principle of divine philosophy is the oneness of the world of  humanity, the unity of mankind, the bond conjoining East and West, the tie  of love which blends human hearts.    Therefore, it is our duty to put forth our greatest efforts and summon all  our energies in order that the bonds of unity and accord may be  established among mankind. For thousands of years we have had bloodshed  and strife. It is enough; it is sufficient. Now is the time to associate  together in love and harmony. For thousands of years we have tried the  sword and warfare; let mankind for a time at least live in peace. Review  history and consider how much savagery, how much bloodshed and battle the  world has witnessed. It has been either religious warfare, political  warfare or some other clash of human interests. The world of humanity has  never enjoyed the blessing of universal peace. Year by year the implements  of warfare have been increased and perfected. Consider the wars of past  centuries; only ten, fifteen or twenty thousand at the most were killed,  but now it is possible to kill one hundred thousand in a single day. In  ancient times warfare was carried on with the sword; today it is the  smokeless gun. Formerly, battleships were sailing vessels; today they are  dreadnoughts. Consider the increase and improvement in the weapons of war.  God has created us all human, and all countries of the world are parts of  the same globe. We are all His servants. He is kind and just to all. Why  should we be unkind and unjust to each other? He provides for all. Why  should we deprive one another? He protects and preserves all. Why should  we kill our fellow creatures? If this warfare and strife be for the sake  of religion, it is evident that it violates the spirit and basis of all  religion. All the divine Manifestations have proclaimed the oneness of God  and the unity of mankind. They have taught that men should love and  mutually help each other in order that they might progress.
