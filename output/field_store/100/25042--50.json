The classes of  father and son together are called a _couple_. The parent from whom the  phratry and class name are thus derived is said to be the _determinant  spouse_.    These phratries and classes regulate marriage. It is forbidden to marry  within one's own phratry. This custom is termed _exogamy_. When the  husband removes and lives in his wife's group the marriage is  _matrilocal_; if the wife removes it is _patrilocal_.    In addition to the division into classes each phratry is further divided  into a number of _totem kins_. A _totem_ is usually a species of animals  or plants; a body of human beings stands in a certain peculiar relation  to the totem species and is termed the totem kin; each member of a totem  kin is termed a _kinsman_. Membership of the totem kin usually descends  directly from parent to child.    The existence of these kinship organisations is universally recognised.  Mr R.H. Mathews has recently asserted the existence of yet another form  and at the same time controverted the accepted views as to the operation  and meaning of those described above. He distinguishes in certain tribes  of New South Wales kinship organisations running across the phratries;  these are of two kinds, according to the author, but they do not seem to  differ in function. They are termed by Mr Mathews \"_blood_\" and  \"_shade_\" divisions, and are held by him to be the names of the really  exogamous groups. The subject is discussed in detail below.    In order to make the working of these regulations plain, let us take as  an example the Kamilaroi tribe of N.S. Wales, with two phratries, four  classes and various totem kins. The phratries are named Dilbi and  Kupathin; Dilbi is divided into two classes, Muri and Kubi; Kupathin  into Kumbo and Ipai. The Dilbi totems, which may belong to either of the  classes, are kangaroo, opossum and iguana; those of Kupathin are emu,  bandicoot and black snake. Every member of the tribe has his own  phratry, class and totem; these all come to him by descent.    We have little or no information as to the local grouping of the  Kamilaroi tribes, but it was possibly not unlike that of some of the  tribes to the north-west. In the case of the latter the tribal area was  some 3000 sq. miles in extent, it was split up into smaller areas,  thirty or more in number, which were the property of the local groups; a  local group consisted frequently of three generations of relatives. When  we come to deal below with marriage regulations it will be shown that  husband, wife and child under the four-class system all belong to  different classes; there were therefore in each group at least three  classes, if not four, and consequently members of two phratries. If we  assume that the same conditions prevailed among the Kamilaroi, the local  groups would then be made up of members of both the Dilbi and Kupathin  phratries; and probably all four classes, Muri, Kubi, Ipai and Kumbo,  would be found in each group, which in Australia varied in size  according to local conditions from 20 or 30 to 200; under special  conditions, such as prevailed in the neighbourhood of Lake Alexandrina,  the number might run up to 600 or more, but this was exceptional.    From the fact that the totems are divided between the phratries it is  clear that the local group may also have members of all the six totem  kins mentioned above, among its members.    The rules by which marriage and descent are regulated are apparently  very complicated but practically very simple. Taking the Kamilaroi tribe  again, the rule is that Muri marries Butha (a female Kumbo) and their  children are Ipai and Ipatha: Kubi marries Ipatha and their children are  Kumbo and Butha; in each case the children belong to the same phratry as  the mother but to the other class in that phratry. This is termed  indirect matrilineal descent.    The rule of descent for the totem among the Kamilaroi was simpler;  membership of a totem kin descends directly from a mother to her child.  The combined effect of these rules is that if, for example, a male Dilbi  of the Muri class and iguana totem wants to marry, he must choose a wife  of the Kupathin phratry, the Kumbo class, and either the emu, bandicoot,  or black snake totems; suppose he marries an emu woman; then his  children are of the Kupathin phratry, the Ipai (or Ipatha) class, and  the emu totem. These regulations are naturally more complicated among  the eight-class tribes; on the other hand, where only phratries and  totems are found, but no classes, descent is much simpler; for in each  case the child takes the phratry and totem of its mother, where  matrilineal descent prevails, or of its father, where patrilineal  descent is found.    The general rule in Australia is that the wife goes to live with her  husband; in other words, she leaves the local group in which she was  born and becomes a member of her husband's local group. The effect of  this is very different according as descent is reckoned through the  mother or through the father. Taking the Kamilaroi again, the  Muri-iguana man brings into his group a Butha-emu woman; their children  are Ipatha-emu. If, therefore, a local group is made up of the  descendants of a single family, the phratry, class, and totem names vary  from generation to generation; for the girls go to other groups, and the  men bring in wives of a phratry, class, and totem different, as a rule,  from their own; the children of the next generation take their kinship  names directly or indirectly from the mother.    If, on the other hand, descent is reckoned through the father, the  phratry and totem names are always the same from generation to  generation; from this it follows that the phratry of the wife, who comes  from without, is also the same from generation to generation, though her  totem name does not of necessity remain the same. The class name  alternates both in the case of the family and of the wives in successive  generations. It has already been pointed out that reckoning of descent  in the male line tends to bring about local grouping of the kinship  organisations. In the eight-class tribes, and in parts of Victoria, the  phratries, elsewhere the totem kins, tend to be or are actually limited  to certain portions of the tribal area.    Our knowledge of these matters has not, of course, been gained at a  bound. Before indicating the present extent of our information, it may  be well to give an historical sketch of early discoveries in this field.    Some seventy years ago the attention of students of primitive social  institutions was drawn to the marriage regulations of the Indian tribes  of North America by an article in _Archaeologia Americana_[38]; in which  the author, drawing his conclusions partly from earlier writers, partly  from his own investigations, showed that the totem kin was an exogamous  group, while in some cases the kin bearing the name of a given totem  were not only exogamous, but not even permitted to choose their wives  from any of the other kins at will, being restricted in their choice to  certain groups or, in many cases, to a single group of totem kins,  according as the tribe was arranged in two or more phratries.    At least two observers had detected the existence of Australian  organisations of the same nature as the American phratries, so far as  our scanty information from West Australia goes, even before the  publication of _Archaeologia Americana_. The honour of being the first  to publish information on the subject belongs to Nind, who had spent  some time in the neighbourhood of King George's Sound in 1829, and  published his observations on native customs in the _Journal of the  Royal Geographical Society_[39] for 1832. Close on his heels came the  authors of _Journals of Explorations in West Australia_, which appeared  in 1833, and described journeys undertaken between 1829 and 1832.    The phratries were discovered in South Australia by the Rev. C.W.  Schuermann, whose Vocabulary[40], published in 1844, contains a mention  of the Parnkalla phratries, without, however, any indication of their  connection with marriage customs and exogamy. Five years earlier,  however, Lieutenant, afterwards Sir George Grey, had observed  institutions of the nature of totem kins, phratries, or intermarrying  classes in West Australia, and had detected their connection with the  marriage laws of the natives[41].    In 1841 and 1842, G.F. Moore[42] called attention to the grouping of the  native divisions or kins, and anticipated Schuermann, as will be shown  later. Grey, before the publication of his _Journal_, had read the  _Archaeologia_; but though he mentions the naming of \"families\" after  animals, he makes no mention of any grouping, but merely distinguishes  between \"families\" and \"local names.\" Some of the names which he gives  seem to be those of phratries, and if he had been led by his study of  _Archaeologia Americana_ to the discovery of exogamic regulations  dealing with the relations of individual totem kins to one another, it  seems on the whole probable that he would not have overlooked the  grouping of the kins which is, with certain exceptions, of a more or  less local character, common to the whole of Australia, so far as our  information goes. Singularly enough this information, very full,  relatively, for the eastern and central tribes, has, so far as  South-West Australia is concerned, only just been completed, although  more than sixty years have elapsed since Grey wrote, the last twenty of  which have seen much additional light thrown on the organisation of the  tribes of the remainder of the continent.    The American tribes, where simple totemic exogamy is not the rule, are  organised in two and sometimes three or more, up to ten, phratries.

And just as his art is life-communicating as is that of scarcely  another, so the contemplation of his personality is life-enhancing as  that of scarcely any other man. Think that great though he was as a  painter, he was no less renowned as a sculptor and architect, musician  and improviser, and that all artistic occupations whatsoever were in his  career but moments snatched from the pursuit of theoretical and  practical knowledge. It would seem as if there were scarcely a field of  modern science but he either foresaw it in vision, or clearly  anticipated it, scarcely a realm of fruitful speculation of which he  was not a freeman; and as if there were hardly a form of human energy  which he did not manifest. And all that he demanded of life was the  chance to be useful! Surely, such a man brings us the gladdest of all  tidings--the wonderful possibilities of the human family, of whose  chances we all partake.    Painting, then, was to Leonardo so little of a preoccupation that we  must regard it as merely a mode of expression used at moments by a man  of universal genius, who recurred to it only when he had no more  absorbing occupation, and only when it could express what nothing else  could, the highest spiritual through the highest material significance.  And great though his mastery over his craft, his feeling for  significance was so much greater that it caused him to linger long over  his pictures, labouring to render the significance he felt but which his  hand could not reproduce, so that he rarely finished them. We thus have  lost in quantity, but have we lost in quality? Could a mere painter, or  even a mere artist, have seen and felt as Leonardo? We may well doubt.  We are too apt to regard a universal genius as a number of ordinary  brains somehow conjoined in one skull, and not always on the most  neighbourly terms. We forget that genius means mental energy, and that a  Leonardo, for the self-same reason that prevents his being merely a  painter--the fact that it does not exhaust a hundredth part of his  energy--will, when he does turn to painting, bring to bear a power of  seeing, feeling, and rendering, as utterly above that of the ordinary  painter as the \"Mona Lisa\" is above, let us say, Andrea del Sarto's  \"Portrait of his Wife.\" No, let us not join in the reproaches made to  Leonardo for having painted so little; because he had much more to do  than to paint, he has left all of us heirs to one or two of the  supremest works of art ever created.      XII.    [Page heading: BOTTICELLI]    Never pretty, scarcely ever charming or even attractive; rarely correct  in drawing, and seldom satisfactory in colour; in types, ill-favoured;  in feeling acutely intense and even dolorous--what is it then that makes  Sandro Botticelli so irresistible that nowadays we may have no  alternative but to worship or abhor him? The secret is this, that in  European painting there has never again been an artist so indifferent to  representation and so intent upon presentation. Educated in a period of  triumphant naturalism, he plunged at first into mere representation with  almost self-obliterating earnestness; the pupil of Fra Filippo, he was  trained to a love of spiritual _genre_; himself gifted with strong  instincts for the significant, he was able to create such a type of the  thinker as in his fresco of St. Augustin; yet in his best years he left  everything, even spiritual significance, behind him, and abandoned  himself to the presentation of those qualities alone which in a picture  are _directly_ life-communicating, and life-enhancing. Those of us who  care for nothing in the work of art but what it represents, are either  powerfully attracted or repelled by his unhackneyed types and quivering  feeling; but if we are such as have an imagination of touch and of  movement that it is easy to stimulate, we feel a pleasure in Botticelli  that few, if any, other artists can give us. Long after we have  exhausted both the intensest sympathies and the most violent  antipathies with which the representative elements in his pictures may  have inspired us, we are only on the verge of fully appreciating his  real genius. This in its happiest moments is an unparalleled power of  perfectly combining values of touch with values of movement.    Look, for instance, at Botticelli's \"Venus Rising from the Sea.\"  Throughout, the tactile imagination is roused to a keen activity, by  itself almost as life heightening as music. But the power of music is  even surpassed where, as in the goddess' mane-like tresses of hair  fluttering to the wind, not in disorderly rout but in masses yielding  only after resistance, the movement is directly life-communicating. The  entire picture presents us with the quintessence of all that is  pleasurable to our imagination of touch and of movement. How we revel in  the force and freshness of the wind, in the life of the wave! And such  an appeal he always makes. His subject may be fanciful, as in the \"Realm  of Venus\" (the \"Spring\"); religious, as in the Sixtine Chapel frescoes  or in the \"Coronation of the Virgin\"; political, as in the recently  discovered \"Pallas Taming a Centaur\"; or even crudely allegorical, as in  the Louvre frescoes,--no matter how unpropitious, how abstract the idea,  the vivid appeal to our tactile sense, the life-communicating movement  is always there. Indeed, at times it seems that the less artistic the  theme, the more artistic the fulfilment, the painter being impelled to  give the utmost values of touch and movement to just those figures which  are liable to be read off as mere empty symbols. Thus, on the figure  representing political disorder--the Centaur--in the \"Pallas,\"  Botticelli has lavished his most intimate gifts. He constructs the torso  and flanks in such a way that every line, every indentation, every boss  appeals so vividly to the sense of touch that our fingers feel as if  they had everywhere been in contact with his body, while his face gives  to a still heightened degree this convincing sense of reality, every  line functioning perfectly for the osseous structure of brow, nose, and  cheeks. As to the hair--imagine shapes having the supreme life of line  you may see in the contours of licking flames, and yet possessed of all  the plasticity of something which caresses the hand that models it to  its own desire!    [Page heading: LINEAL DECORATION]    In fact, the mere subject, and even representation in general, was so  indifferent to Botticelli, that he appears almost as if haunted by the  idea of communicating the _unembodied_ values of touch and movement. Now  there is a way of rendering even tactile values with almost no body, and  that is by translating them as faithfully as may be into values of  movement. For instance:--we want to render the roundness of a wrist  without the slightest touch of either light or shade; we simply give the  movement of the wrist's outline and the movement of the drapery as it  falls over it, and the roundness is communicated to us almost entirely  in terms of movement. But let us go one step further. Take this line  that renders the roundness of the wrist, or a more obvious example, the  lines that render the movements of the tossing hair, the fluttering  draperies, and the dancing waves in the \"Birth of Venus\"--take these  lines alone with all their power of stimulating our imagination of  movement, and what do we have? Pure values of movement abstracted,  unconnected with any representation whatever. This kind of line, then,  being the quintessence of movement, has, like the essential elements in  all the arts, a power of stimulating our imagination and of directly  communicating life. Well! imagine an art made up entirely of these  quintessences of movement-values, and you will have something that holds  the same relation to representation that music holds to speech--and this  art exists, and is called lineal decoration. In this art of arts Sandro  Botticelli may have had rivals in Japan and elsewhere in the East, but  in Europe never. To its demands he was ready to sacrifice everything  that habits acquired under Filippo and Pollaiuolo,--and his  employers!--would permit. The representative element was for him a mere  _libretto_: he was happiest when his subject lent itself to translation  into what may be called a lineal symphony. And to this symphony  everything was made to yield; tactile values were translated into values  of movement, and, for the same reason--to prevent the drawing of the eye  inward, to permit it to devote itself to the rhythm of the line--the  backgrounds were either entirely suppressed or kept as simple as  possible. Colour also, with almost a contempt for its representative  function, Botticelli entirely subordinated to his lineal scheme,  compelling it to draw attention to the line, rather than, as is usual,  away from it.    This is the explanation of the value put upon Botticelli's masterpieces.  In some of his later works, such as the Dresden _predelle_, we have, it  is true, bacchanals rather than symphonies of line, and in many of his  earlier paintings, in the \"_Fortezza_,\" for instance, the harness and  trappings have so disguised Pegasus that we scarcely know him from a  cart horse. But the painter of the \"Venus Rising from the Sea,\" of the  \"Spring,\" or of the Villa Lemmi frescoes is the greatest artist of  lineal design that Europe has ever had.      XIII.    [Page heading: POPULARISERS OF ART]    Leonardo and Botticelli, like Michelangelo after them, found imitators  but not successors. To communicate more material and spiritual  significance than Leonardo, would have taken an artist with deeper  feeling for significance; to get more music out of design than  Botticelli, would have required a painter with even greater passion for  the re-embodiment of the pure essences of touch and movement. There were  none such in Florence, and the followers of Botticelli--Leo"]]]
