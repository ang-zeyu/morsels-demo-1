When we  intercept their calls they're pure gibberish to us. Can they read our  codes?\"    \"The supposition is that they can't. Only, concerning Throgs, all we  know is supposition. Anyway, they do know the routine for establishing a  Terran colony, and we can't alter that procedure except in small  nonessentials,\" Thorvald said grimly. \"If that transport doesn't pick up  the proper signal to set down here on schedule, her captain will call in  the patrol escort ... then exit one Throg base. But if the beetle-heads  can trick the ship in and take her, then they'll have a clear five or  six more months here to consolidate their own position. After that it  would take more than just one patrol cruiser to clear Warlock; it will  require a fleet. So the Throgs will have another world to play with, and  an important one. This lies on a direct line between the Odin and  Kulkulkan systems. A Throg base on such a trade route could eventually  cut us right out of this quarter of the galaxy.\"    \"So you think they want to capture us in order to bring the transport  in?\"    \"By our type of reasoning, that would be a logical move--_if_ they know  we are here. They haven't too many of those hounds, and they don't risk  them on petty jobs. I'd hoped we'd covered our trail well. But we had to  risk that attack on the camp.... I needed the map case!\" Again Thorvald  might have been talking to himself. \"Time ... and the right maps--\" he  brought his fist down on the raft, making the platform tremble--\"that's  what I have to have now.\"    Another patch of light-willows stretched along the river-banks, and as  they sailed through that ribbon of ghostly radiance they could see each  other's faces. Thorvald's was bleak, hard, his eyes on the stream behind  them as if he expected at any moment to see a Throg emerge from the  surface of the water.    \"Suppose that thing--\" Shann pointed upstream with his chin--\"follows  us? What is it anyway?\" Hound suggested Terran dog, but he couldn't  stretch his imagination to believe in a working co-operation between  Throg and any mammal.    \"A rather spectacular combination of toad and lizard, with a few other  grisly touches, is about as close as you can get to a general  description. And that won't be too accurate, because like the Throgs its  remote ancestors must have been of the insect family. If the thing  follows us, and I think we can be sure that it will, we'll have to take  steps. There is always this advantage--those hounds cannot be controlled  from a flyer, and the beetle-heads never take kindly to foot slogging.  So we won't have to expect any speedy chase. If it slips its masters in  rough country, we can try to ambush it.\" In the dim light Thorvald was  frowning. \"I flew over the territory ahead on two sweeps, and it is a  queer mixture. If we can reach the rough country bordering the sea,  we'll have won the first round. I don't believe that the Throgs will be  in a hurry to track us in there. They'll try two alternatives to chasing  us on foot. One, use their energy beams to rake any suspect valley, and  since there are hundreds of valleys all pretty much alike, that will  take some time. Or they can attempt to shake us out with a dumdum should  they have one here, which I doubt.\"    Shann tensed. The stories of the effects of the Throg's dumdum weapon  were anything but pretty.    \"And to get a dumdum,\" Thorvald continued as if he were discussing a  purely theoretical matter and not a threat of something worse than  death, \"They'll have to bring in one of their major ships. Which they  will hesitate to do with a cruiser near at hand. Our own danger spot now  is the section we should strike soon after dawn tomorrow if the rate of  this current is what I have timed it. There is a band of desert on this  side of the mountains. The river gorge deepens there and the land is  bare. Let them send a ship over and we could be as visible as if we were  sending up flares----\"    \"How about taking cover now and going on only at night?\" suggested  Shann.    \"Ordinarily, I'd say yes. But with time pressing us now, no. If we keep  straight on, we could reach the foothills in about forty hours, maybe  less. And we have to stay with the river. To strike across country there  without good supplies and on foot is sheer folly.\"    Two days. With perhaps the Throgs unleashing their hound on land,  combing from their flyers. With a desert.... Shann put out his hands to  the wolverines. The prospect certainly didn't seem anywhere near as  simple as it had the night before when Thorvald had planned this escape.  But then the Survey officer had left out quite a few points which were  not pertinent. Was he also leaving out other essentials? Shann wanted to  ask, but somehow he could not.    After a while he dozed, his head resting on his knees. He awoke, roused  out of a vivid dream, a dream so detailed and so deeply impressed in a  picture on his mind that he was confused when he blinked at the  riverbank visible in the half-light of early dawn.    Instead of that stretch of earth and ragged vegetation now gliding past  him as the raft angled along, he should have been fronting a vast skull  stark against the sky--a skull whose outlines were oddly inhuman, from  whose eyeholes issued and returned flying things while its sharply  protruding lower jaw was lapped by water. In color that skull had been a  violent clash of blood-red and purple. Shann blinked again at the  riverbank, seeing transposed on it still that ghostly haze of bone-bare  dome, cavernous eyeholes and nose slit, fanged jaws. That skull was a  mountain, or a mountain was a skull--and it was important to him; he  must locate it!    He moved stiffly, his legs and arms cramped but not cold. The wolverines  stirred on either side of him. Thorvald continued to sleep, curled up  beyond, the pole still clasped in his hands. A flat map case was slung  by a strap about his neck, its thin envelope between his arm and his  body as if for safekeeping. On the smooth flap was the Survey seal, and  it was fastened with a finger lock.    Thorvald had lost some of the bright hard surface he had shown at the  spaceport where Shann had first sighted him. There were hollows in his  cheeks, sending into high relief those bone ridges beneath his eye  sockets, giving him a faint resemblance to the skull of Shann's dream.  His face was grimed, his field uniform stained and torn. Only his hair  was as bright as ever.    Shann smeared the back of his hand across his own face, not doubting  that he must present an even more disreputable appearance. He leaned  forward cautiously to look into the water, but that surface was not  quiet enough to act as a mirror.    Getting to his feet as the raft bobbed under his shift of weight, Shann  studied the territory now about them. He could not match Thorvald's  inches, just as he must have a third less bulk than the officer, but  standing, he could sight something of what now lay beyond the rising  banks of the cut. That grass which had been so thick in the meadowlands  around the camp had thinned into separate clumps, pale lavender in  color. And the scrawniness of stem and blade suggested dehydration and  poor soil. The earth showing between those clumps was not of the usual  blue, but pallid, too, bleached to gray, while the bushes along the  stream's edge were few and smaller. They must have crossed the line into  the desert Thorvald had promised.    Shann edged around to face west. There was light enough in the sky to  sight tall black pyramids waiting. They had to reach those distant  mountains, mountains whose feet on the other side were resting in sea  water. He studied them carefully, surveying each peak he could separate  from its fellows.    Did the skull lie among them? The conviction that the place he had seen  in his dream was real, that it was to be found on Warlock, persisted.  Not only was it a definite feature of the landscape somewhere in the  wild places of this world, but it was also necessary for him to locate  it. Why? Shann puzzled over that, with a growing uneasiness which was  not quite fear, not yet, anyway.    Thorvald moved. The raft tilted and the wolverines became growly. Shann  sat down, one hand out to the officer's shoulder in warning. Feeling  that touch Thorvald shifted, one hand striking out blindly in a blow  which Shann was just able to avoid while with the other he pinned the  map case yet tighter to him.    \"Take it easy!\" Shann urged.    The other's eyelids flicked. He looked up, but not as if he saw Shann at  all.    \"The Cavern of the Veil----\" he muttered. \"Utgard....\" Then his eyes did  focus and he sat up, gazing around him with a frown.    \"We're in the desert,\" Shann announced.    Thorvald got up, balancing on feet planted a little apart, looking to  the faded expanse of the waste spreading from the river cut. He stared  at the mountains before he squatted down to fumble with the lock of the  map case.    The wolverines were growing restless, though they still did not try to  move about too freely on the raft, greeting Shann with vocal complaint.  He and Thorvald could satisfy their hunger with a handful of  concentrates from the survival kit. But those dry tablets could not  serve the animals. Shann studied the terrain with more knowledge than he  had possessed a week earlier. This was not hunting land, but there  remained the bounty of the river.    \"We'll have to feed Taggi and Togi,\" he broke the silence abruptly. \"If  we don't, they'll be into the river and off on their own.\"    Thorvald glanced up from one of the tough, thin sheets of map skin,  again as if he had been drawn back from some distance. His eyes moved  from Shann to the unpromising shore.    \"How? With what?\" he wanted to know. Then the real urgency of the  situation must "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#9)"],[1," have put it that way.\"    Bart's hands dropped to his sides, but he heard his voice crack with  pain and grief: \"I suppose you'll tell me he was a spy or a traitor and  you _had_ to kill him!\"    \"Not even that. I tried to save your father, I did everything I could.  I'm no murderer, Bart. I killed him, yes--God forgive me, because I'll  never forgive myself!\"    Bart's fists unclenched and he stared down at Raynor Three, shaking his  head in bewilderment and pain. \"I knew he was dead! I knew it all along!  I was trying not to believe it, but I knew!\"    \"I liked your father. I admired him. He took a long chance, and it  killed him. I could have stopped him, I should have stopped him, but how  could I? Where did I have the right to stop him, after what I did  to--\" he stopped, almost in mid-word, as if a switch had been turned.    But Bart was not listening. He swung away, striding to the wall as if he  would kick it in, striking it with his two clenched fists, his whole  being in revolt. _Dad, oh, Dad! I kept going, I thought at the end of it  you'd be here and it would all be over. But here I am at the end of it  all, and you're not here, you won't ever be here again._    Dimly, he knew when Raynor Three rose and left him alone. He leaned his  head on his clenched fists, and cried.    After a long time he raised his head and blew his nose, his face setting  itself in new, hard, unaccustomed lines, slowly coming to terms with the  hard, painful reality. His father was dead. His dangerous,  dead-in-earnest game of escape had no happy ending of reunion with his  father. They couldn't sit together and laugh about how scared he had  been. His father was _dead_, and he, Bart, was alone and in danger. His  face looked very grim indeed, and years older than he was.    After a long time Raynor Three opened the door quietly. \"Come and have  something to eat, Bart.\"    \"I'm not hungry.\"    \"Well, I am,\" Raynor Three said, \"and you ought to be. You'll need it.\"  He pulled knobs and the appropriate tables and chairs extruded  themselves from the walls. Raynor unsealed hot cartons and spread them  on the table, saying lightly, \"Looks good--not that I can claim any  credit, I subscribe to a food service that delivers them hot by  pneumatic tube.\"    Bart felt sickened by the thought of eating, but when he put a polite  fork in the food, he discovered that he was famished and ate up  everything in sight. When they had finished, Raynor dumped the cartons  into a disposal chute, went to a small portable bar and put a glass into  his hand.    \"Drink this.\"    Bart touched his lips to the glass, made a face and put it away.  \"Thanks, but I don't drink.\"    \"Call it medicine, you'll need something,\" Raynor Three said crossly.  \"I've got a lot to tell you, and I don't want you going off half-primed  in the middle of a sentence. If you'd rather have a shot of  tranquilizer, all right; otherwise, I prescribe that you drink what I  gave you.\" He gave Bart a quick, wry grin. \"I really am a medic, you  know.\"    Feeling like a scolded child, Bart drank. It burned his mouth, but after  it was down, he felt a sort of warm burning in his insides that  gradually spread a sense of well-being all through him. It wasn't  alcohol, but whatever it was, it had quite a kick.    \"Thanks,\" he muttered. \"Why are you taking this trouble, Raynor? There  must be danger--\"    \"Don't you know--\" Raynor broke off. \"Obviously, you don't. Your mother  never said much about your Mentorian family tree, I suppose? She was a  Raynor.\" He smiled at Bart, a little ruefully. \"I won't claim a  kinsman's privileges until you decide how much to trust me.\"    Raynor Three settled back.    \"It's a long story and I only know part of it,\" he began. \"Our family,  the Raynors, have traded with the Lhari for more generations than I can  count. When I was a young man, I qualified as a medic on the Lhari  ships, and I've been star-hopping ever since. People call us the slaves  of the Lhari--maybe we are,\" he added wryly. \"But I began it just  because space is where I belong, and there's nowhere else that I've ever  wanted to be. And I'll take it at any price.    \"I never questioned what I was doing until a few years ago. It was your  father who made me wonder if we Mentorians were blind and selfish--this  privilege ought to belong to everyone, not just the Lhari. More and  more, the Lhari monopoly seemed wrong to me. But I was just a medic. And  if I involved myself in any conspiracy against the Lhari, they'd find it  out in the routine psych-checking.    \"And then we worked out how it could be done. Before every trip, with  self-hypnosis and self-suggestion, I erase my own memories--a sort of  artificial amnesia--so that the Lhari can't find out any more than I  want them to find out. Of course, it also means that I have no memory,  while I'm on the Lhari ships, of what I've agreed to while I'm--\" His  face suddenly worked, and his mouth moved without words, as if he had  run into some powerful barrier against speech.    It was a full minute, while Bart stared in dismay, before he found his  voice again, saying, \"So far, it was just a sort of loose network,  trying to put together stray bits of information that the Lhari didn't  think important enough to censor.    \"And then came the big breakthrough. There was a young Apprentice  astrogator named David Briscoe. He'd taken some runs in special test  ships, and read some extremely obscure research data from the early days  of the contact between men and Lhari, and he had a wild idea. He did the  bravest thing anyone has ever done. He stripped himself of all  identifying data--so that if he died, no one would be in trouble with  the Lhari--and stowed away on a Lhari ship.\"    \"But--\" Bart's lips were dry--\"didn't he die in the warp-drive?\"    Slowly, Raynor Three shook his head.    \"No, he didn't. No drugs, no cold-sleep--but he didn't die. Don't you  see, Bart?\" He leaned forward, urgently.    \"_It's all a fake!_ The Lhari have just been saying that to justify  their refusal to give us the secret of the catalyst that generates the  warp-drive frequencies! Such a simple lie, and it's worked for all these  years!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"A Mentorian found him and didn't have the heart to turn him over to the  Lhari. So he was smuggled clear again. But when that Mentorian underwent  the routine brain-checks at the end of the voyage, the Lhari found out  what had happened. They didn't know Briscoe's name, but they wrung that  Mentorian out like a wet dishcloth and got a description that was as  good as fingerprints. They tracked down young Briscoe and killed him.  They killed the first man he'd talked to. They killed the second. The  third was your father.\"    \"The murdering devils!\"    Raynor sighed. \"Your father and Briscoe's father were old friends.  Briscoe's father was dying with incurable heart disease; _his_ son was  dead, and old Briscoe had only one thought in his mind--to make sure he  didn't die for nothing. So he took your father's papers, knowing they  were as good as a death warrant, slipped away and boarded a Lhari ship  that led roundabout to stars where the message hadn't reached yet. He  led them a good chase. Did he die or did they track him down and kill  him?\" Bart bowed his head and told the story.    \"Meanwhile,\" Raynor Three continued, \"your father came to me, knowing I  was sympathetic, knowing I was a Lhari-trained surgeon. He had just one  thought in his mind: to do, again, what David Briscoe had done, and make  sure the news got out this time. He cooked up a plan that was even  braver and more desperate. He decided to sign on a Lhari ship as a  member of the crew.\"    \"As a Mentorian?\" Bart asked, but something cold, like ice water  trickling down his back, told him this was not what Raynor meant. \"The  brainwashing--\"    \"No,\" said Raynor, \"not as a Mentorian; he couldn't have escaped the  psych-checking. _As a Lhari._\"    Bart gasped. \"How--\"    \"Men and Lhari are very much alike,\" Raynor Three said. \"A few small  things--skin color, the shape of the ears, the hands and claws--keep  humans from seeing that the Lhari are men.\"    \"Don't say that,\" Bart almost yelled. \"Those filthy, murdering devils!  You call those monsters men?\"    \"I've lived among the Lhari all my life. They're not devils, Bart, they  have their reasons. Physiologically, the Lhari are--well, _humanoid_, if  you like that better. They're a lot more like a man than a man is like,  for instance, a gorilla. Your father convinced me that with minor  plastic and facial surgery, he could pass as a Lhari. And finally I gave  in, and did the surgery--\"    \"And it killed him!\"    \"Not really. It was a completely unforeseeable thing--a blood clot broke  loose in a vein, and lodged in his brain. He was dead in seconds. It  could have happened at any time,\" he said, \"yet I feel responsible, even  though I keep telling myself I'm not. And I'll help you as much as I  can--for his sake, and for your mother's. The Lhari don't watch me too  closely--they figure that anything I do they'll catch in the  brainwashing. But I'm still one step ahead of them, as long as I can  erase my own memories.\"    Bart was sifting it all, slowly, in his mind.    \"Why was Dad doing this? What could he gain?\"    \"You know we can build ships as good as the Lhari ships, but we don't  know anything about the rare catalyst they use for warp-drive fuel.  Captain Steele had hopes of being able to discover where they got it.\"    \"But couldn't they find out where the Lhari ships go for fueling?\"    \"No. There's no way to trail a Lhari ship,\" he reminded Bart. \"We can  follow them inside a star-system, but then they pop into warp-drive, and  we don't know where they go when they aren't running between _our_  stars.    \"We've gathered together what information we _do_ have, and we know that  after a certain number of runs in our part of the galaxy,"]]]
