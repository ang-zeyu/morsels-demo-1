As Dot was listening to the fighting of the Flying Foxes, she heard a  sound near her that alarmed her greatly. It was impossible to say what  the noise was like. It might have been the braying of a donkey mixed up  with the clattering of palings tumbled together, and with grunts and  snorts. Dot started to her feet in fright, and would have run away, only  she was afraid of being lost worse than ever, so she stood still and  looked round for the terrible monster that could make such extraordinary  sounds. The grunts and clattering stopped, and the noise died away in a  long doleful bray, but she could not see where it came from. Having  peered into the dark shadows, Dot went more into the open, and sat with  her back to a fallen tree, keeping an anxious watch all round.    \"Perhaps it is the Blacks. What would they do with me if they found me?  What will happen if they have killed my dear Kangaroo?\" and she covered  her face with her hands as this terrible thought came into her head.  Soon she heard something coming towards her stealthily and slowly. She  would not look up she was so frightened. She was sure it was some  fierce-looking Black man, with his spear, about to kill her. She shut  her eyes closer, and held her breath. \"Perhaps,\" she thought, \"he will  not see me.\" Then a cold shiver went through her little body, as she  felt something claw hold of her hair, and she thought she was about to  be killed. She kept her eyes shut, and the clawing went on, and then to  her astonishment she heard an animal voice say in wondering tones:    \"Why, it's fur! how funny it looked in the moonlight!\" Then Dot opened  her eyes very wide and looked round, and saw a funny Native Bear on the  tree trunk behind her. He was quite clearly to be seen in the moonlight.  His thick, grey fur, that looked as if he was wrapped up to keep out the  most terrible cold weather; his short, stumpy, big legs, and little  sharp face with big bushy ears, could be seen as distinctly as in  daylight. Dot had never seen one so near before, and she loved it at  once, it looked so innocent and kind.    \"You dear little Native Bear!\" she exclaimed, at once stroking its head.    \"Am I a Native Bear?\" asked the animal in a meek voice. \"I never heard  that before. I thought I was a Koala. I've always been told so, but of  course one never knows oneself. What are you? Do you know?\"    \"I'm a little girl,\" replied Dot, proudly.    The Koala saw that Dot was proud, but as it didn't see any reason why  she should be, it was not a bit afraid of her.    \"I never heard of one or saw one before,\" it said, simply. \"Do you  burrow, or live in a tree?\"    \"I live at home,\" said Dot; but, wishing to be quite correct, she added,  \"that is, when I am there.\"    \"Then, where are you now?\" asked the Koala, rather perplexed.    \"I'm not at home,\" replied Dot, not knowing how to make her position  clear to the little animal.    \"Then you live where you don't live?\" said the Koala; \"where is it?\" and  the little Bear looked quite unhappy in its attempt to understand what  Dot meant.    \"I've lost it,\" said Dot. \"I don't know where it is.\"    \"You make my head feel empty,\" said the Koala, sadly. \"I live in the gum  tree over there. Do you eat gum leaves?\"    \"No. When I'm at home I have milk, and bread, and eggs, and meat.\"    \"Dear me!\" said the Koala. \"They're all new to one. Is it far? I should  like to see the trees they grow on. Please show me the way.\"    \"But I can't,\" said Dot; \"they don't grow on trees, and I don't know my  way home. It's lost, you see.\"    \"I don't see,\" said the Native Bear. \"I never can see far at night, and  not at all in daylight. That is why I came here. I saw your fur shining  in the moonlight, and I couldn't make out what it was, so I came to see.  If there is anything new to be seen, I must get a near view of it. I  don't feel happy if I don't know all about it. Aren't you cold?\"    \"Yes, I am, a little, since my Kangaroo left me,\" Dot said.    \"Now you make my head feel empty again,\" said the Koala, plaintively.  \"What has a Kangaroo got to do with your feeling cold? What have you  done with your fur?\"    \"I never had any,\" said Dot, \"only these curls,\" and she touched her  little head.    \"Then you ought to be black,\" argued the Koala. \"You're not the right  colour. Only Blacks have no fur, but what they steal from the proper  owners. Do you steal fur?\" it asked in an anxious voice.    \"How do they steal fur?\" asked Dot.    The Koala looked very miserable, and spoke with horror. \"They kill us  with spears, and tear off our skins and wear them because their own  skins are no good.\"    \"That's not stealing,\" said Dot; \"that's killing\"; and, although it  seemed very difficult to make the little Bear understand, she explained,  \"Stealing is taking away another person's things; and when a person is  dead he hasn't anything belonging to him, so it's not stealing to take  what belonged to him before, because it isn't his any longer--that is,  if it doesn't belong to anyone else.\"    \"You make my head feel empty,\" complained the Koala. \"I'm sure you're  all wrong; for an animal's skin and fur is his own, and it's his life's  business to keep it whole. Everyone in the bush is trying to keep his  skin whole, all day long, and all night too. Good gracious! what is the  matter up there?\"    A terrible hullabaloo between a pair of Opossums up a neighbouring gum  tree arrested the attention of both Dot and the Koala. Presently the  sounds of snarling, spitting, and screaming ended, and an Opossum  climbed out to the far end of a branch, where the moonlight shone on his  grey fur like silver. There he remained snapping and barking  disagreeable things to his mate, who climbed up to the topmost branch,  and snarled and growled back equally unpleasant remarks.    \"Why don't you bring in gum leaves for to-morrow, instead of sleeping  all day and half the night too?\" shouted the Opossum on the branch to  his wife. \"You know I get hungry before daylight is over and hate going  out in the light.\"    \"Get them yourself, you lazy loon!\" retorted the lady Opossum. \"If you  disturb my dreams again this way, I'll make your fur fly.\"    \"Take care!\" barked back her husband, \"or I'll bring you off that branch  pretty quickly.\"    \"You'd better try!\" sneered his wife. \"Remember how I landed you into  the billabong the other night!\"    The taunt was too much for the Opossum on the branch; he scuttled up the  tree to reach his mate, who sprang forward from her perch into the air.  Dot saw her spring with her legs all spread out, so that the skinny  flaps were like furry wings. By this means she was able to break her  fall, and softly alighting on the earth, a moment after, she had  scrambled up another tree, followed by her mate. From tree to tree, from  branch to branch, they fled or pursued one another, with growls,  screams, and splutters, until they disappeared from sight.    \"How unhappy those poor Opossums must be, living in the same tree,\" said  Dot; \"why don't they live in different trees?\"    \"They wouldn't be happy,\" observed the Koala, \"they are so fond of one  another.\"    \"Then why do they quarrel?\" asked Dot.    \"Because they live in the same tree of course,\" said the Koala. \"If they  lived in different trees, and never quarrelled, they wouldn't like it at  all. They'd find life dull, and they'd get sulky. There's nothing worse  than a sulky 'possum. They are champions at that.\"    \"They make a dreadful noise with their quarrelling,\" said Dot. \"They are  nearly as bad as the Flying Foxes over there. I wonder if they made that  fearful sound I heard just before you came?\"    [Illustration: DOT, THE NATIVE BEAR, AND THE OPOSSUM]    \"I expect what you heard was from me,\" said the Koala; \"I had just  awakened, and when I saw the moon was up I felt pleased.\"    \"Was all that sound and many noises yours?\" asked Dot with astonishment,  as she regarded the shaggy little animal on the tree trunk.    The Koala smiled modestly. \"Yes!\" it said; \"when I'm pleased there is no  creature in the bush can make such a noise, or so many different noises  at once. I waken everyone for a quarter of a mile round. You wouldn't  think it, to see me as I am, would you?\" The Koala was evidently very  pleased with this accomplishment.    \"It isn't kind of you to wake up all the sleeping creatures,\" said Dot.    \"Why not?\" asked the Koala. \"You are a night creature, I suppose, or you  wouldn't be awake now. Well, don't you think it unfair the way  everything is arranged for the day creatures?\"    \"But then,\" said Dot, \"there are so many more day creatures.\"    \"That doesn't make any difference,\" observed the Koala.    \"But it does,\" said Dot.    \"How?\" asked the Native Bear.    \"Because if you had the day it wouldn't be any good to you, and if they  had the night it wouldn't be any good to them. So your night couldn't be  their day, and their day couldn't be your night.\"    \"You make my head feel empty,\" said the Koala. \"But you'd think  differently if a flock of Kookooburras settled on your tree, and  guffawed idiotically when you wanted to sleep.\"    \"As you don't like being waked yourself, why do you wake others then?\"  asked Dot.    \"Because this is a free country,\" said the Koala. While Dot was trying  to understand why the Koala's reason should suffice for one animal  making another's life uncomfortable, she was rejoiced to see the  Kangaroo bound into sight. She forgot all about the Koala, and rushed  forward to meet it.          CHAPTER VII      \"I'm so glad you've come back!\" she exclaimed.    The Kangaroo was a little breathless and excited. \"We are not in danger  at present,\" she said, \"but one never knows when one will be, so we must  move; and that will be more dangerous than staying where we are.\"    \"Then let us stay,\" said Dot.    \"That won't do,\" replied the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#9)"],[1,"classic  form was ever being encroached upon by oriental richness of material  and color. The struggle was a long but hopeless one. As in Italy,  form failed century by century. When, in the eighth century, the  Iconoclastic controversy cut away the little Greek existing in it, the  oriental ornament was about all that remained.    There was no chance for painting to rise under the prevailing  conditions. Free artistic creation was denied the artist. An advocate  of painting at the Second Nicene Council declared that: \"It is not the  invention of the painter that creates the picture, but an inviolable  law of the Catholic Church. It is not the painter but the holy fathers  who have to invent and dictate. To them manifestly belongs the  composition, to the painter only the execution.\" Painting was in a  strait-jacket. It had to follow precedent and copy what had gone  before in old Byzantine patterns. Both in Italy and in Byzantium the  creative artist had passed away in favor of the skilled artisan--the  repeater of time-honored forms or colors. The workmanship was good for  the time, and the coloring and ornamental borders made a rich setting,  but the real life of art had gone. A long period of heavy, morose,  almost formless art, eloquent of mediaeval darkness and ignorance,  followed.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--EZEKIEL BEFORE THE LORD. MS. ILLUMINATION.  PARIS, NINTH CENTURY.]    It is strange that such an art should be adopted by foreign nations,  and yet it was. Its bloody crucifixions and morbid madonnas were well  fitted to the dark view of life held during the Middle Ages, and its  influence was wide-spread and of long duration. It affected French and  German art, it ruled at the North, and in the East it lives even to  this day. That it strongly affected Italy is a very apparent fact.  Just when it first began to show its influence there is matter of  dispute. It probably gained a foothold at Ravenna in the sixth  century, when that province became a part of the empire of Justinian.  Later it permeated Rome, Sicily, and Naples at the south, and Venice  at the north. With the decline of the early Christian art of Italy  this richer, and in many ways more acceptable, Byzantine art came in,  and, with Italian modifications, usurped the field. It did not  literally crush out the native Italian art, but practically it  superseded it, or held it in check, from the ninth to the twelfth  century. After that the corrupted Italian art once more came to the  front.         EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE REMAINS: The best examples of       Early Christian painting are still to be seen in the       Catacombs at Rome. Mosaics in the early churches of Rome,       Ravenna, Naples, Venice, Constantinople. Sculptures,       ivories, and glasses in the Lateran, Ravenna, and Vatican       museums. Illuminations in Vatican and Paris libraries.       Almost all the museums of Europe, those of the Vatican and       Naples particularly, have some examples of Byzantine work.       The older altar-pieces of the early Italian churches date       back to the mediaeval period and show Byzantine influence.       The altar-pieces of the Greek and Russian churches show the       same influence even in modern work.          CHAPTER V.    ITALIAN PAINTING.    GOTHIC PERIOD. 1250-1400.

SIGNS OF THE AWAKENING: It would seem at first as though nothing but  self-destruction could come to that struggling, praying,  throat-cutting population that terrorized Italy during the Mediaeval  Period. The people were ignorant, the rulers treacherous, the passions  strong, and yet out of the Dark Ages came light. In the thirteenth  century the light grew brighter, but the internal dissensions did not  cease. The Hohenstaufen power was broken, the imperial rule in Italy  was crushed. Pope and emperor no longer warred each other, but the  cries of \"Guelf\" and \"Ghibelline\" had not died out.    Throughout the entire Romanesque and Gothic periods (1000-1400) Italy  was torn by political wars, though the free cities, through their  leagues of protection and their commerce, were prosperous. A  commercial rivalry sprang up among the cities. Trade with the East,  manufactures, banking, all flourished; and even the philosophies, with  law, science, and literature, began to be studied. The spirit of  learning showed itself in the founding of schools and universities.  Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, reflecting respectively religion,  classic learning, and the inclination toward nature, lived and gave  indication of the trend of thought. Finally the arts, architecture,  sculpture, painting, began to stir and take upon themselves new  appearances.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In painting, though there were some portraits  and allegorical scenes produced during the Gothic period, the chief  theme was Bible story. The Church was the patron, and art was only the  servant, as it had been from the beginning. It was the instructor and  consoler of the faithful, a means whereby the Church made converts,  and an adornment of wall and altar. It had not entirely escaped from  symbolism. It was still the portrayal of things for what they meant,  rather than for what they looked. There was no such thing then as art  for art's sake. It was art for religion's sake.    The demand for painting increased, and its subjects multiplied with  the establishment at this time of the two powerful orders of Dominican  and Franciscan monks. The first exacted from the painters more learned  and instructive work; the second wished for the crucifixions, the  martyrdoms, the dramatic deaths, wherewith to move people by emotional  appeal. To offset this the ultra-religious character of painting was  encroached upon somewhat by the growth of the painters' guilds, and  art production largely passing into the hands of laymen. In  consequence painting produced many themes, but, as yet, only after the  Byzantine style. The painter was more of a workman than an artist. The  Church had more use for his fingers than for his creative ability. It  was his business to transcribe what had gone before. This he did, but  not without signs here and there of uneasiness and discontent with the  pattern. There was an inclination toward something truer to nature,  but, as yet, no great realization of it. The study of nature came in  very slowly, and painting was not positive in statement until the time  of Giotto and Lorenzetti.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--GIOTTO, FLIGHT INTO EGYPT. ARENA CHAP.  PADUA.]    The best paintings during the Gothic period were executed upon the  walls of the churches in fresco. The prepared color was laid on wet  plaster, and allowed to soak in. The small altar and panel pictures  were painted in distemper, the gold ground and many Byzantine features  being retained by most of the painters, though discarded by some few.    CHANGES IN THE TYPE, ETC.: The advance of Italian art in the Gothic  age was an advance through the development of the imposed Byzantine  pattern. It was not a revolt or a starting out anew on a wholly  original path. When people began to stir intellectually the artists  found that the old Byzantine model did not look like nature. They  began, not by rejecting it, but by improving it, giving it slight  movements here and there, turning the head, throwing out a hand, or  shifting the folds of drapery. The Eastern type was still seen in the  long pathetic face, oblique eyes, green flesh tints, stiff robes, thin  fingers, and absence of feet; but the painters now began to modify and  enliven it. More realistic Italian faces were introduced,  architectural and landscape backgrounds encroached upon the Byzantine  gold grounds, even portraiture was taken up.    This looks very much like realism, but we must not lay too much stress  upon it. The painters were taking notes of natural appearances. It  showed in features like the hands, feet, and drapery; but the anatomy  of the body had not yet been studied, and there is no reason to  believe their study of the face was more than casual, nor their  portraits more than records from memory.    No one painter began this movement. The whole artistic region of Italy  was at that time ready for the advance. That all the painters moved at  about the same pace, and continued to move at that pace down to the  fifteenth century, that they all based themselves upon Byzantine  teaching, and that they all had a similar style of working is proved  by the great difficulty in attributing their existing pictures to  certain masters, or even certain schools. There are plenty of pictures  in Italy to-day that might be attributed to either Florence or Sienna,  Giotto or Lorenzetti, or some other master; because though each master  and each school had slight peculiarities, yet they all had a common  origin in the art traditions of the time.
