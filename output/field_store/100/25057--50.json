Now alumina, lime,  resin, and resin-soaps, etc., precipitate dyestuffs, and also soap; if  the water is alkaline, some of the mordants used may be precipitated and  wasted, and very considerable damage done.    Permanent hardness in water, due to the presence of gypsum or sulphate  of lime in solution, may be remedied by addition of caustic soda. Of  course, if an alkaline water is objectionable in any process, the alkali  would have to be neutralised by the addition of some acid. For use in  boilers, water might thus be treated, but it would become costly if  large quantities required such treatment. Water rendered impure by  contaminations from dyehouses and some chemical works can be best  purified, and most cheaply, by simple liming, followed by a settling  process. If space is limited and much water is required, instead of the  settling reservoirs, filtering beds of coke, sand, etc., may be used.  The lime used neutralises acids in the contaminated and impure water,  precipitates colouring matters, mordants, soap, albuminous matters, etc.    _Tests of Purity._--I will now describe a few tests that may be of value  to you in deciding as to what substances are contaminating any impure  waters that may be at hand.    _Iron._--If to a water you suspect to be hard from presence of carbonate  of lime or carbonate of iron in solution in carbonic acid, _i.e._ as  bicarbonates, you add some clear lime-water, and a white precipitate is  produced, you have a proof of carbonate of lime--hardness. If the  precipitate is brownish, you may have, also, carbonate of iron. I will  now mention a very delicate test for iron. Such a test would be useful  in confirmation. If a very dilute solution of such iron water be treated  with a drop or two of pure hydrochloric acid, and a drop or so of  permanganate of potash solution or of Condy's fluid, and after that a  few drops of yellow prussiate of potash solution be added, then a blue  colour (Prussian blue), either at once or after standing a few hours,  proves the presence of iron.    _Copper._--Sometimes, as in the neighbourhood of copper mines or of some  copper pyrites deposits, a water may be contaminated with small  quantities of copper. The yellow prussiate once more forms a good test,  but to ensure the absence of free mineral acids, it is first well to add  a little acetate of soda solution. A drop or two of the prussiate  solution then gives a brown colour, even if but traces of copper are  present.    _Magnesia._--Suppose lime and magnesia are present. You may first  evaporate to a small bulk, adding a drop of hydrochloric acid if the  liquid becomes muddy. Then add ammonia and ammonium oxalate, when lime  alone is precipitated as the oxalate of lime. Filter through blotting  paper, and to the clear filtrate add some phosphate of soda solution. A  second precipitation proves the presence of magnesia.    _Sulphates._--A solution of barium chloride and dilute hydrochloric acid  gives a white turbidity.    _Chlorides._--A solution of silver nitrate and nitric acid gives a white  curdy precipitate.    _Test for Lead in Drinking Water._--I will, lastly, give you a test that  will be useful in your own homes to detect minute quantities of lead in  water running through lead pipes. Place a large quantity of the water in  a glass on a piece of white paper, and add a solution of sulphuretted  hydrogen and let stand for some time. A brown colour denotes lead. Of  course copper would also yield a brown coloration, but I am supposing  that the circumstances preclude the presence of copper.    I have already said that rain water is the purest of natural waters; it  is so soft, and free from dissolved mineral matters because it is a  distilled water. In distilling water to purify it, we must be very  careful what material we use for condensing the steam in, since it is a  fact probably not sufficiently well known, that the softer and purer a  water is, the more liable it is to attack lead pipes. Hence a coil of  lead pipe to serve as condensing worm would be inadmissible. Such water  as Manchester water, and Glasgow water from Loch Katrine still more so,  are more liable to attack lead pipes than the hard London waters. To  illustrate this fact, we will distil some water and condense in a leaden  worm, then, on testing the water with our reagent, the sulphuretted  hydrogen water, a brown colour is produced, showing the presence of  lead. On condensing in a block tin worm, however, no tin is dissolved,  so tin is safer and better as the material for such a purpose than lead.    _Filtration._--We hear a great deal about filtration or filters as  universal means of purifying water. Filtration, we must remember, will,  as a rule, only remove solid or suspended impurities in water. For  example, if we take some ivory black or bone black, and mix it with  water and afterwards filter the black liquid through blotting-paper, the  bone black remains on the paper, and clear, pure water comes through.  Filtering is effective here. If we take some indigo solution, however,  and pour it on to the filter, the liquid runs through as blue as it was  when poured upon the filter. Filtering is ineffective here, and is so  generally with liquids containing matters dissolved in them. But I said  \"generally,\" and so the question is suggested--Will filtration of any  kind remove matters in solution? This question I will, in conclusion,  try to answer. Bone charcoal, or bone black, has a wonderful attraction  for many organic matters such as colours, dyes, and coloured impurities  like those in peat water, raw sugar solutions, etc. For example, if we  place on a paper filter some bone black, and filter through it some  indigo solution, after first warming the latter with some more of the  bone black, the liquid comes through clear, all the indigo being  absorbed in some peculiar way, difficult to explain, by the bone black,  and remaining on the filter. This power of charcoal also extends to  gases, and to certain noxious dissolved organic impurities, but it is  never safe to rely too much on such filters, since the charcoal can at  length become charged with impurities, and gradually cease to act. These  filters need cleaning and renewing from time to time.          LECTURE V    ACIDS AND ALKALIS      _Properties of Acids and Alkalis._--The name acids is given to a class  of substances, mostly soluble in water, having an acid or sour taste,  and capable of turning blue litmus solution red. All acids contain one  or more atoms of hydrogen capable of being replaced by metals, and when  such hydrogen atoms are completely replaced by metals, there result  so-called neutral or normal salts, that is, neutral substances having no  action on litmus solution. These salts can also be produced by the union  of acids with equivalent quantities of certain metallic oxides or  hydroxides, called bases, of which those soluble in water are termed  alkalis. Alkalis have a caustic taste, and turn red litmus solution  blue.    In order to explain what is called the law of equivalence, I will remind  you of the experiment of the previous lecture, when a piece of bright  iron, being placed in a solution of copper sulphate, became coated with  metallic copper, an equivalent weight of iron meanwhile suffering  solution as sulphate of iron. According to the same law, a certain  weight of soda would always require a certain specific equivalent weight  of an acid, say hydrochloric acid, to neutralise its alkaline or basic  properties, producing a salt.    The specific gravities of acids and alkalis in solution are made use of  in works, etc., as a means of ascertaining their strengths and  commercial values. Tables have been carefully constructed, such that  for every degree of specific gravity a corresponding percentage strength  of acidity and alkalinity may be looked up. The best tables for this  purpose are given in Lunge and Hurter's _Alkali-Makers' Pocket-Book_,  but for ordinary purposes of calculation in the works or factory, a  convenient relationship exists in the case of hydrochloric acid between  specific gravity and percentage of real acid, such that specific gravity  as indicated by Twaddell's hydrometer directly represents percentage of  real acid in any sample of hydrochloric acid.    The point at which neutralisation of an acid by alkali or _vice versa_  just takes place is ascertained very accurately by the use of certain  sensitive colours. At first litmus and cochineal tinctures were used,  but in testing crude alkalis containing alumina and iron, it was found  that lakes were formed with these colours, and they become precipitated  in the solution, and so no longer sensitive. The chemist was then  obliged to resort to certain sensitive coal-tar colours, which did not,  as the dyer and printer knew, form lakes with alumina and iron, such as  methyl orange, fluorescein, Congo red, phenolphthalein, and so forth.  For determining the alkalimetric strength of commercial sodas, a known  weight of the sample is dissolved in water, and a few drops of a  solution of methyl orange are added, which colour the solution yellow or  orange. Into this solution is then run, from a burette or graduated  tube, a standard solution of an acid, that is, a solution prepared by  dissolving a known weight of an acid, say hydrochloric acid, in a known  volume of water. The acid is run in gradually until the yellow colour  changes to pink, at which point the volume of acid used is noted.  Knowing the weight of acid contained in this volume of standard acid,  and having regard to the law of equivalence mentioned above, it is an  easy matter to calculate the amount of alkali equivalent to the acid  used, and from this the alkali contained in the sample.    _Sulphuric Acid._--The first process for manufacturing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#9)"],[1,"of an adult cow buffalo.

The first signs of the change, however, appear about a month  earlier than that, in the darkening of the mane under the throat, and  also on the top of the neck.[26]    [Note 26: Our captive had, in some way, bruised the skin on his  forehead, and in June all the hair came off the top of his head, leaving  it quite bald. We kept the skin well greased with porpoise oil, and by  the middle of July a fine coat of black hair had grown out all over the  surface that had previously been bare.]    By the 1st of August the red hair on the body begins to fall off in  small patches, and the growth of fine, new, dark hair seems to actually  crowd off the old. As is the case with the adult animals, the shortest  hair is the first to be shed, but the change of coat takes place in  about half the time that it occupies in the older animals.    By the 1st of October the transformation is complete, and not even a  patch of the old red hair remains upon the new suit of brown. This is  far from being the case with the old bulls and cows, for even up to the  last week in October we found them with an occasional patch of the old  hair still clinging to the new, on the back or shoulders.    Like most young animals, the calf of the buffalo is very easily tamed,  especially if taken when only a few weeks old. The one captured in  Montana by the writer, resisted at first as stoutly as it was able, by  butting with its head, but after we had tied its legs together and  carried it to camp, across a horse, it made up its mind to yield  gracefully to the inevitable, and from that moment became perfectly  docile. It very soon learned to drink milk in the most satisfactory  manner, and adapted itself to its new surroundings quite as readily as  any domestic calf would have done. Its only cry was a low-pitched,  pig-like grunt through the nose, which was uttered only when hungry or  thirsty.    I have been told by old frontiersmen and buffalo-hunters that it used to  be a common practice for a hunter who had captured a young calf to make  it follow him by placing one of his fingers in its mouth, and allowing  the calf to suck at it for a moment. Often a calf has been induced in  this way to follow a horseman for miles, and eventually to join his camp  outfit. It is said that the same result has been accomplished with  calves by breathing a few times into their nostrils. In this connection  Mr. Catlin's observations on the habits of buffalo calves are most  interesting.    \"In pursuing a large herd of buffaloes at the season when their calves  are but a few weeks old, I have often been exceedingly amused with the  curious maneuvers of these shy little things. Amidst the thundering  confusion of a throng of several hundreds or several thousands of these  animals, there will be many of the calves that lose sight of their dams;  and being left behind by the throng, and the swift-passing hunters, they  endeavor to secrete themselves, when they are exceedingly put to it on a  level prairie, where naught can be seen but the short grass of 6 or 8  inches in height, save an occasional bunch of wild sage a few inches  higher, to which the poor affrighted things will run, and dropping on  their knees, will push their noses under it and into the grass, where  they will stand for hours, with their eyes shut, imagining themselves  securely hid, whilst they are standing up quite straight upon their hind  feet, and can easily be seen at several miles distance. It is a familiar  amusement with us, accustomed to these scenes, to retreat back over the  ground where we have just escorted the herd, and approach these little  trembling things, which stubbornly maintain their positions, with  their noses pushed under the grass and their eyes strained upon us, us  we dismount from our horses and are passing around them. From this fixed  position they are sure not to move until hands are laid upon them, and  then for the shins of a novice we can extend our sympathy; or if he can  preserve the skin on his bones from the furious buttings of its head, we  know how to congratulate him on his signal success and good luck.

Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the  publishers.]    \"In these desperate struggles for a moment, the little thing is  conquered, and makes no further resistance. And I have often, in  concurrence with a known custom of the country, held my hands over the  eyes of the calf and breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils,  after which I have, with my hunting companions, rode several miles into  our encampment with the little prisoner busily following the heels of my  horse the whole way, as closely and as affectionately as its instinct  would attach it to the company of its dam.    \"This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with in  the habits of this wild country, and although I had often heard of it,  and felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to bear  testimony to the fact from the numerous instances which I have witnessed  since I came into the country. During the time that I resided at this  post [mouth of the Tetón River] in the spring of the year, on my way up  the river, I assisted (in numerous hunts of the buffalo with the fur  company's men) in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these  little prisoners, which sometimes followed for 5 or 6 miles close to our  horse's heels, and even into the fur company's fort, and into the stable  where our horses were led. In this way, before I left the headwaters of  the Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen, which Mr. Laidlaw  was successfully raising with the aid of a good milch cow.\"[27]    [Note 27: North American Indians, I, 255.]    It must be remembered, however, that such cases as the above were  exceptional, even with the very young calves, which alone exhibited the  trait described. Such instances occurred only when buffaloes existed in  such countless numbers that man's presence and influence had not  affected the character of the animal in the least. No such instances of  innocent stupidity will ever be displayed again, even by the youngest  calf. The war of extermination, and the struggle for life and security  have instilled into the calf, even from its birth, a mortal fear of both  men and horses, and the instinct to fly for life. The calf captured by  our party was not able to run, but in the most absurd manner it butted  our horses as soon as they came near enough, and when Private Moran  attempted to lay hold of the little fellow it turned upon him, struck  him in the stomach with its head, and sent him sprawling into the  sage-brush. If it had only possessed the strength, it would have led us  a lively chase.    During 1886 four other buffalo calves were either killed or caught by  the cowboys on the Missouri-Yellowstone divide, in the Dry Creek  region. All of them ran the moment they discovered their enemies. Two  were shot and killed. One was caught by a cowboy named Horace Brodhurst,  ear marked, and turned loose. The fifth one was caught in September on  the Porcupine Creek round-up. He was then about five months old, and  being abundantly able to travel he showed a clean pair of heels. It took  three fresh horses, one after another, to catch him, and his final  capture was due to exhaustion, and not to the speed of any of his  pursuers. The distance covered by the chase, from the point where his  first pursuer started to where the third one finally lassoed him, was  considered to be at least 15 miles. But the capture came to naught, for  on the following day the calf died from overexertion and want of milk.    Colonel Dodge states that the very young calves of a herd have to depend  upon the old bulls for protection, and seldom in vain. The mothers  abandon their offspring on slight provocation, and even none at all  sometimes, if we may judge from the condition of the little waif that  fell into our hands. Had its mother remained with it, or even in its  neighborhood, we should at least have seen her, but she was nowhere  within a radius of 5 miles at the time her calf was discovered. Nor did  she return to look for it, as two of us proved by spending the night in  the sage-brush at the very spot where the calf was taken. Colonel Dodge  declares that \"the cow seems to possess scarcely a trace of maternal  instinct, and, when frightened, will abandon and run away from her calf  without the slightest hesitation. * * * When the calves are young they  are always kept in the center of each small herd, while the bulls  dispose themselves on the outside.\"[28]    [Note 28: Plains of the Great West, pp. 124, 125.]    Apparently the maternal instinct of the cow buffalo was easily"]]]
