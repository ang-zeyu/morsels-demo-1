A nice  comfortable sort of woman.\"    \"You fool, that's her mother.\"    \"Oh, I beg your pardon. But anyhow, Bill, I want you more than she does  just now. So try and put up with me.\"    \"I say, do you really?\" said Bill, rather flattered. He had a great  admiration for Antony, and was very proud to be liked by him.    \"Yes. You see, things are going to happen here soon.\"    \"Inquests and that sort of thing?\"    \"Well, perhaps something before that. Hallo, here comes Cayley.\"    Cayley was walking across the lawn towards them, a big, heavy-shouldered  man, with one of those strong, clean-shaven, ugly faces which can never  quite be called plain. \"Bad luck on Cayley,\" said Bill. \"I say, ought  I to tell him how sorry I am and all that sort of thing? It seems so  dashed inadequate.\"    \"I shouldn't bother,\" said Antony.    Cayley nodded as he came to them, and stood there for a moment.    \"We can make room for you,\" said Bill, getting up.    \"Oh, don't bother, thanks. I just came to say,\" he went on to Antony,  \"that naturally they've rather lost their heads in the kitchen,  and dinner won't be till half-past eight. Do just as you like about  dressing, of course. And what about your luggage?\"    \"I thought Bill and I would walk over to the inn directly, and see about  it.\"    \"The car can go and fetch it as soon as it comes back from the station.\"    \"It's very good of you, but I shall have to go over myself, anyhow, to  pack up and pay my bill. Besides, it's a good evening for a walk. If you  wouldn't mind it, Bill?\"    \"I should love it.\"    \"Well, then, if you leave the bag there, I'll send the car round for it  later.\"    \"Thanks very much.\"    Having said what he wanted to say, Cayley remained there a little  awkwardly, as if not sure whether to go or to stay. Antony wondered  whether he wanted to talk about the afternoon's happenings, or whether  it was the one subject he wished to avoid. To break the silence he asked  carelessly if the Inspector had gone.    Cayley nodded. Then he said abruptly, \"He's getting a warrant for Mark's  arrest.\"    Bill made a suitably sympathetic noise, and Antony said with a shrug  of the shoulders, \"Well, he was bound to do that, wasn't he? It doesn't  follow that--well, it doesn't mean anything. They naturally want to get  hold of your cousin, innocent or guilty.\"    \"Which do you think he is, Mr. Gillingham?\" said Cayley, looking at him  steadily.    \"Mark? It's absurd,\" said Bill impetuously.    \"Bill's loyal, you see, Mr. Cayley.\"    \"And you owe no loyalty to anyone concerned?\"    \"Exactly. So perhaps I might be too frank.\"    Bill had dropped down on the grass, and Cayley took his place on the  seat, and sat there heavily, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his  hands, gazing at the ground.    \"I want you to be quite frank,\" he said at last. \"Naturally I am  prejudiced where Mark is concerned. So I want to know how my suggestion  strikes you who have no prejudices either way.\"    \"Your suggestion?\"    \"My theory that, if Mark killed his brother, it was purely accidental as  I told the Inspector.\"    Bill looked up with interest.    \"You mean that Robert did the hold-up business,\" he said, \"and there was  a bit of a struggle, and the revolver went off, and then Mark lost his  head and bolted? That sort of idea?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Well, that seems all right.\" He turned to Antony. \"There's nothing  wrong with that, is there? It's the most natural explanation to anyone  who knows Mark.\"    Antony pulled at his pipe.    \"I suppose it is,\" he said slowly. \"But there's one thing that worries  me rather.\"    \"What's that?\" Bill and Cayley asked the question simultaneously.    \"The key.\"    \"The key?\" said Bill.    Cayley lifted his head and looked at Antony. \"What about the key?\" he  asked.    \"Well, there may be nothing in it; I just wondered. Suppose Robert was  killed as you say, and suppose Mark lost his head and thought of nothing  but getting away before anyone could see him. Well, very likely  he'd lock the door and put the key in his pocket. He'd do it without  thinking, just to gain a moment's time.\"    \"Yes, that's what I suggest.\"    \"It seems sound enough,\" said Bill. \"Sort of thing you'd do without  thinking. Besides, if you are going to run away, it gives you more of a  chance.\"    \"Yes, that's all right if the key is there. But suppose it isn't there?\"    The suggestion, made as if it were already an established fact, startled  them both. They looked at him wonderingly.    \"What do you mean?\" said Cayley.    \"Well, it's just a question of where people happen to keep their keys.  You go up to your bedroom, and perhaps you like to lock your door in  case anybody comes wandering in when you've only got one sock and a pair  of braces on. Well, that's natural enough. And if you look round the  bedrooms of almost any house, you'll find the keys all ready, so that  you can lock yourself in at a moment's notice. But downstairs people  don't lock themselves in. It's really never done at all. Bill, for  instance, has never locked himself into the dining-room in order to be  alone with the sherry. On the other hand, all women, and particularly  servants, have a horror of burglars. And if a burglar gets in by the  window, they like to limit his activities to that particular room. So  they keep the keys on the outside of the doors, and lock the doors when  they go to bed.\" He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and added, \"At  least, my mother always used to.\"    \"You mean,\" said Bill excitedly, \"that the key was on the outside of the  door when Mark went into the room?\"    \"Well, I was just wondering.\"    \"Have you noticed the other rooms--the billiard-room, and library, and so  on?\" said Cayley.    \"I've only just thought about it while I've been sitting out here. You  live here--haven't you ever noticed them?\"    Cayley sat considering, with his head on one side.    \"It seems rather absurd, you know, but I can't say that I have.\" He  turned to Bill. \"Have you?\"    \"Good Lord, no. I should never worry about a thing like that.\"    \"I'm sure you wouldn't,\" laughed Antony. \"Well, we can have a look when  we go in. If the other keys are outside, then this one was probably  outside too, and in that case well, it makes it more interesting.\"    Cayley said nothing. Bill chewed a piece of grass, and then said, \"Does  it make much difference?\"    \"It makes it more hard to understand what happened in there. Take your  accidental theory and see where you get to. No instinctive turning of  the key now, is there? He's got to open the door to get it, and opening  the door means showing his head to anybody in the hall--his cousin, for  instance, whom he left there two minutes ago. Is a man in Mark's state  of mind, frightened to death lest he should be found with the body,  going to do anything so foolhardy as that?\"    \"He needn't have been afraid of me,\" said Cayley.    \"Then why didn't he call for you? He knew you were about. You could  have advised him; Heaven knows he wanted advice. But the whole theory  of Mark's escape is that he was afraid of you and of everybody else,  and that he had no other idea but to get out of the room himself, and  prevent you or the servants from coming into it. If the key had been on  the inside, he would probably have locked the door. If it were on the  outside, he almost certainly wouldn't.\"    \"Yes, I expect you're right,\" said Bill thoughtfully. \"Unless he took  the key in with him, and locked the door at once.\"    \"Exactly. But in that case you have to build up a new theory entirely.\"    \"You mean that it makes it seem more deliberate?\"    \"Yes; that, certainly. But it also seems to make Mark out an absolute  idiot. Just suppose for a moment that, for urgent reasons which neither  of you know anything about, he had wished to get rid of his brother.  Would he have done it like that? Just killed him and then run away? Why,  that's practically suicide--suicide whilst of unsound mind. No. If you  really wanted to remove an undesirable brother, you would do it a little  bit more cleverly than that. You'd begin by treating him as a friend, so  as to avoid suspicion, and when you did kill him at last, you would try  to make it look like an accident, or suicide, or the work of some other  man. Wouldn't you?\"    \"You mean you'd give yourself a bit of a run for your money?\"    \"Yes, that's what I mean. If you were going to do it deliberately, that  is to say and lock yourself in before you began.\"    Cayley had been silent, apparently thinking over this new idea. With his  eyes still on the ground, he said now: \"I hold to my opinion that it was  purely accidental, and that Mark lost his head and ran away.\"    \"But what about the key?\" asked Bill.    \"We don't know yet that the keys were outside. I don't at all agree with  Mr. Gillingham that the keys of the down-stairs rooms are always outside  the doors. Sometimes they are, no doubt; but I think we shall probably  find that these are inside.\"    \"Oh, well, of course, if they are inside, then your original theory  is probably the correct one. Having often seen them outside, I just  wondered that's all. You asked me to be quite frank, you know, and tell  you what I thought. But no doubt you're right, and we shall find them  inside, as you say.    \"Even if the key was outside,\" went on Cayley stubbornly, \"I still  think it might have been accidental. He might have taken it in with him,  knowing that the interview would be an unpleasant one, and not wishing  to be interrupted.\"    \"But he had just told you to stand by in case he wanted you; so why  should he lock you out? Besides, I should think that if a man were going  to have an unpleasant interview with a threatening relation, the last  thing he would do would be to barricade himself in with him. He would  want to open all the doors and say, 'Get out of it'\"    Cayley was silent, but his mouth looked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#9)"],[1,"kindliest feelings for you personally--\"    \"Thank you, sir--\"    \"And the warmest admiration for your talents as an officer.

You'll go far in your profession--\"    \"Thank you, sir--\"    \"And that's why I don't like you as a son-in-law.\"    \"W--Wha--\"    \"I love my daughter, and I want her to be happy in a real home with a  real husband and children by her side. A soldier's life is a dog's life.  I've pitied the poor girl who gave up her home for me. Many a bitter  tear has she shed over my absence, in torturing dread of the next letter  from the frontier--\"    He paused and sprang to his feet:    \"A hundred times I've sworn no daughter of mine should ever marry a  soldier! The better the soldier, the more reason she should not marry  him--\"    \"But, sir--\"    \"There's no 'but' about it!\" the Colonel thundered. \"You're asking me to  let you murder my girl, that's all--but it's life. I'll have to give my  consent and wish you good luck, long life, and all the happiness you can  get out of a soldier's lot.\"    The Colonel extended his hand and the Lieutenant grasped it with  grateful eagerness.    The days that followed were red lettered in the calendar of life.    And then it came--a crash of thunder out of the clear sky--the thing he  had somehow felt and dreaded.    A petty court-martial was called to adjust a question of army  discipline. The court was composed of Z. Taylor, Colonel Commanding,  Major Thomas F. Smith, a fiery-tempered gay officer of the old army,  Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, and the new Second Lieutenant who had just  arrived from the Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis.    The army regulations required that each officer sitting in court-martial  should be in full uniform. The new arrival from St. Louis had come  without his uniform. His trunk had miscarried and was returned to the  Jefferson Barracks.    He rose with embarrassment:    \"I must beg the pardon of the Court, Colonel,\" he began cautiously, \"for  not appearing in my uniform. As it is in St. Louis I respectfully ask to  be excused to-day from wearing it.\"    The old Colonel scowled. It was just like a young fool to wish to sit in  solemn judgment on a fellow officer--in his shirt sleeves. If he had  asked to be excused from serving on the Court--yes--he could accept his  excuse and let him go. But this insolence was unbearable. The Colonel  glanced over the Court before putting the question to a vote. Smith was  his enemy. Whichever way he voted as President, the Major could be  depended on to go against his decision. There was a feud between those  two hot-tempered fire-eaters which had lasted for years. He glanced at  his future son-in-law with a smile of assured victory. Tom Smith would  vote against him, but the trembling youngster who had quailed before him  that night asking for his daughter's hand was practically in the family.  He smiled at the certainty of downing Smith once more.    In a voice, whose tones left nothing to the imagination of the  presumptuous Second Lieutenant, the Colonel growled:    \"Gentlemen, we are asked to allow an officer to sit in the formal  judgment of a court-martial without uniform--I put the question to a  vote and cast mine. No!\"    \"I vote yes!\" shouted the Major.    The Colonel did not condescend to look his way. He knew what that vote  was before he heard it. He bent his piercing eyes on his future  son-in-law:    \"Lieutenant Davis?\"    There was just a moment's hesitation. The Lieutenant smiled at his  embarrassed young fellow officer and mildly answered:    \"I think, Colonel, in view of the distance to St. Louis, we may excuse  the young man for the first offense--I vote--yes.\"    The old Colonel stared at him in speechless amazement. Smith grinned.    The Colonel's face grew purple with rage. He was just able to gasp his  words during the progress of the trial. It was brief, and when it ended  and the rest had gone, he faced the Lieutenant with blazing eyes:    \"How dare you, sir, vote with that damned fool against me?\"    \"Why, I never thought to hurt you, Colonel--\"    \"No? And what _did_ you think?\"    \"I only thought of relieving the evident embarrassment of a young  officer--\"    \"You did, eh?--no thought of me or my feelings, of my wishes. You're a  hell of a son-in-law, you are--\"    He paused for breath and choked with rage no words could express. When  at last his tongue found speech, he swore in oaths more expressive and  profound than modern man has ever dreamed. He damned the Court. He  damned Tom Smith. He damned the Second Lieutenant. He damned the  regiment. He damned the Government that created it. He damned the  Indians that called it to the plains. He damned the world and all in it,  and all things under it. But, particularly and specifically, he damned  the young ass who dared to flaunt his feelings and opinions after  smiling in his face at his house, for days and weeks and months.    Finally, facing the blushing Lieutenant, his eyes flashing indignant  scorn, he shouted:    \"No man who votes with a damned fool like Tom Smith, can marry my  daughter!\"    \"Colonel, I protest,\" pleaded the heartsick lover.    \"I forbid you to ever put your foot inside my quarters again!\"    \"Colonel--\"    \"Silence, sir! I forbid you to ever speak to my daughter again!\"    \"But, Colonel--\"    \"I repudiate you and all yours. I wipe you from the map. You don't  exist. I don't know you. I never knew you. Get out of my sight!\"    The tall, slender form slowly straightened and a look of cold pride  shot from the depths of his blue eyes. Without a word he turned and  left.          X    ROMANCE      Black Hawk was leading his red warriors in a great uprising. A wave of  fierce excitement swept the frontier. There was stern work now for men  to do and women must wait alone.    The regiment marched to the front. The Colonel as a man was freezingly  formal with the Lieutenant. As an officer, he knew his worth and relied  on it in every emergency. The State of Illinois had raised two companies  of raw recruits to join in subduing the Indians. The Colonel sent his  most efficient subordinate to swear in the new soldiers. On the morning  of the muster, there appeared before the tall Lieutenant, a man full  three inches taller, and famous in his county as the gawkiest,  slab-sidest, homeliest, best-natured fellow in the State. He was dressed  in a suit of blue jeans.    In slow, pleasing drawl, he announced:    \"I am the Captain, of this company--\"    And he waved his long arm toward the crowd of his countrymen on the  right.    Lieutenant Jefferson Davis promptly administered to Abraham Lincoln his  first oath to support the Constitution and laws of the United States.    Two men destined to immortal fame had met and passed with scarcely a  glance at each other. The young army officer was too much of a gentleman  to mark the ill-fitting blue jeans of the awkward captain of militia.  Great events, after all, make men great. Only the eye of God could  foresee the coming tragedy in which these two would play their mighty  roles.    At the end of the brief struggle on the frontier, Black Hawk's people  were scattered to the four winds and the brave old warrior, with a  handful of his men, sought Colonel Taylor's command to surrender.    Again, the Colonel sent his most accomplished officer, the Lieutenant  whom he had forbidden to enter his house,--to treat with the fallen  Chief.    The Lieutenant received with kindly words the broken-hearted warrior,  his two sons and sixty braves, and conducted them at once as prisoners  of war to the barracks at St. Louis.    The cholera was raging at Rock Island, and on the boat two of the Indian  prisoners were seized with the fatal disease. The Lieutenant, at the  risk of his life, personally ministered to their needs. The two stricken  men made known to the commander in broken words and signs that they had  sworn an oath of eternal friendship. In pleading tones the stronger  said:    \"We beg the good Chief to put us ashore that hand in hand we may go to  the happy hunting grounds together.\"    Near the first little settlement their prayer was granted.    The young officer turned to his boat with a sigh as he saw the red  warriors slip their arms about each other and slowly sink to the ground  to die alone and unattended.    Old Black Hawk sat in silent, stolid indifference to his fate until the  curious settlers began to crowd on the boat and stare at his misery.    The Lieutenant interfered with sharp decision.    \"Push those men back, Corporal!\" he ordered angrily.    The crowd was roughly pushed back and the Lieutenant took Black Hawk  kindly by the arm and led him into a reserved apartment where he was  free from vulgar eyes.    The old man's lips tightened. He gazed at the officer steadily and spoke  in measured tones:    \"The young war Chief treats me with much kindness. He is good and brave.  He puts himself in my place and sees all that I suffer. With him I am  much pleased.\"    The Lieutenant bowed and left him under the protection of the guard.  Courtesy to a fallen foe in the old days was the first obligation of an  officer and a gentleman.    In the autumn, Colonel Taylor again sent his Lieutenant on a distant  duty--this time one of peculiar danger. He was ordered to Louisville and  Lexington on recruiting service. And the cholera was known to be  epidemic but a few miles from Lexington.    The good-by scene that night at the lovers' trysting place, the little  tent reception-room of the McCreas', was long and tender and solemn.    \"Oh, I feel dreadful about this trip, dear,\" his sweetheart kept  repeating with pitiful despair that refused to be comforted.    \"You must be brave, my own,\" he answered with a frown. \"A soldier's  business is to die. I am a soldier. I go where duty calls--\"    \"To battle--yes--but this black pestilence that comes in the"]]]
