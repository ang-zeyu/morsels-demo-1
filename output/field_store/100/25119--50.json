A series of tones sung in a certain way, which are produced by a  certain position of the vocal organs--larynx, tongue, and palate.  Every voice includes three registers--chest, middle, and head. But all  are not employed in every class of voice.    Two of them are often found connected to a certain extent in  beginners; the third is usually much weaker, or does not exist at all.  Only very rarely is a voice found naturally equalized over its whole  compass.    Do registers exist by nature? No. It may be said that they are created  through long years of speaking in the vocal range that is easiest to  the person, or in one adopted by imitation, which then becomes a  fixed habit. If this is coupled with a natural and proper working of  the muscles of the vocal organs, it may become the accustomed range,  strong in comparison with others, and form a register by itself. This  fact would naturally be appreciated only by singers.    If, on the other hand, the muscles are wrongly employed in speaking,  not only the range of voice generally used, but the whole voice as  well, may be made to sound badly. So, in every voice, one or another  range may be stronger or weaker; and this is, in fact, almost always  the case, since mankind speaks and sings in the pitch easiest or most  accustomed, without giving thought to the proper position of the  organs in relation to each other; and people are rarely made to pay  attention as children to speaking clearly and in an agreeable voice.  In the most fortunate instances the range thus practised reaches  limits on both sides, not so much those of the person's power, as  those set by his lack of skill, or practice. Limitations are put on  the voice through taking account only of the easiest and most  accustomed thing, without inquiring into the potentialities of the  organs or the demands of art.    [Illustration: Red lines denote a register is formed when as many  tones as possible are forced upon one and the same point of resonance.  (Bass and baritone.)]    [Illustration: Red lines denote a register is formed when as many  tones as possible are forced upon one and the same point of resonance.  (Soprano, contralto, and tenor.)]    Now, suppose such a peculiarity which includes, let us say, three or  four tones, is extended to six or eight, then, in the course of time,  in the worst cases, a break is produced at the outside limits. In the  most favorable cases the tones lying next beyond these limits are  conspicuously weak and without power compared with those previously  forced. This one way of singing can be used no farther; another must  be taken up, only, perhaps, to repeat farther the incorrect procedure.    Three such limits or ways of singing can be found and used. Chest,  middle, and head voice, all three form registers when exaggerated; but  they should be shaded off and melt into each other. The organs,  through the skilful training of the teacher, as well as by the  exercise of the pupil's talent and industry, must be accustomed to  taking such positions that one register leads into another  imperceptibly. In this way beauty, equality, and increased compass of  the voice will be made to enhance its usefulness.    When the three ways of singing are too widely different and too  sharply contrasted, they become separate registers. These are  everywhere accepted as a matter of course, and for years have been a  terror in the teaching of singing, that has done more than anything  else to create a dreadful bewilderment among singers and teachers. To  eradicate it is probably hopeless. Yet, these registers are nothing  more than three disconnected manners of using the vocal and resonating  apparatus.    With all the bad habits of singers, with all the complete ignorance of  cause and effect, that prevail, it is not surprising that some pretend  to tell us that there are two, three, four, or five registers,  although as a matter of fact there can be at most three in any voice.  It will be much more correct to call every tone of every voice by the  name of a new additional register, for in the end, every tone will and  _must_ be taken in a different relation, with a different position of  the organs, although the difference may be imperceptible, if it is to  have its proper place in the whole. People cling to the appellations  of chest, middle, and head _register_, confounding voice with  register, and making a hopeless confusion, from which only united and  very powerful forces can succeed in extricating them.    As long as the word \"register\" is kept in use, the registers will not  disappear. And yet, the register question must be swept away, to give  place to another class of ideas, sounder views on the part of  teachers, and a truer conception on the part of singers and pupils.          SECTION XV    DEVELOPMENT AND EQUALIZATION      Naturally, a singer can devote more strength to the development of one  or two connected ranges of his voice than to a voice perfectly  equalized in all its accessible ranges. For this are required many  years of the most patient study and observation, often a  long-continued or entire sacrifice of one or the other limit of a  range for the benefit of the next-lying weaker one; of the head voice  especially, which, if unmixed, sounds uneven and thin in comparison  with the middle range, until by means of practised elasticity of the  organs and endurance of the throat muscles a positive equalization can  take place.    Voices which contain only one or two registers are called short  voices, for their availability is as limited as they are themselves.    Yet it must be remembered that all voices alike, whether short or  long, even those of the most skilful singers, when age comes on, are  apt to lose their highest ranges, if they are not continually  practised throughout their entire compass with the subtlest use of the  head tones. Thence it is to be concluded that a singer ought always to  extend the compass of his voice as far as possible, in order to be  certain of possessing the compass that he needs.    On the formation of the organs depends much of the character of the  voice. There are strong, weak, deep, and high voices by nature; but  every voice, by means of proper study, can attain a certain degree of  strength, flexibility, and compass.    Unfortunately, stubbornness enters largely into this question, and  often works in opposition to the teacher. Many, for instance, wish to  be altos, either because they are afraid of ruining their voices by  working for a higher compass, or because it is easier for them, even  if their voices are not altos at all.    Nowadays operas are no longer composed for particular singers and the  special characteristics of their voices. Composers and librettists  express what they feel without regard to an alto singer who has no  high C or a soprano who has no low A flat or G. But the _artist_ will  always find what he needs.    Registers exist in the voices of almost all singers, but they ought  not to be heard, ought not, indeed, to exist. Everything should be  sung with a mixed voice in such a way that no tone is forced at the  expense of any other. To avoid monotony the singer should have at his  disposal a wealth of means of expression in all ranges of his voice.  (See the Varieties of Attack and Dynamic Power.) Before all else he  should have knowledge of the advantages in the resonance of certain  tones, and of their connection with each other. The _soul_ must  provide the color; skill and knowledge as to cause and effect,  management of the breath, and perfection of the throat formation must  give the power to produce every dynamic gradation and detail of  expression. Registers are, accordingly, produced when the singer  forces a series of tones, generally ascending, upon one and the same  resonating point, instead of remembering that in a progression of  tones no one tone can be exactly like another, because the position of  the organs must be different for each. The palate must remain elastic  from the front teeth to its hindmost part, mobile and susceptible,  though imperceptibly, to all changes. Very much depends on the  continuous harmony of action of the soft and hard palate, which must  always be in full evidence, the raising and extension of the former  producing changes in the tone. If, as often happens when the registers  are sharply defined, tones fall into a _cul de sac_, escape into  another register is impossible, without a jump, which may lead to  disaster. With every tone that the singer has to sing, he must always  have the feeling that he _can_ go higher, and that the attack for  different tones must not be forced upon one and the same point.    The larynx must not be _suddenly_ pressed down nor jerked up, except  when this is desired as a special effect. That is, when one wishes to  make a transition, _legato_, from a chest tone to a tone in the middle  or head register, as the old Italians used to do, and as I, too,  learned to do, thus:--    [Music illustration]    In this case the chest tone is attacked very nasal, in order that the  connection may remain to the upper note, and the larynx is suddenly  jerked up to the high tone. This was called breaking the tone; it was  very much used, and gave fine effects when it was well done. I use it  to-day, especially in Italian music, where it belongs. It is an  exception to the rule for imperceptible or inaudible change of  position of the organs,--that it should not be made _suddenly_.    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#9)"],[1," of recognizing many  of these overtones and may be trained to do so. The most obvious can  be readily separated from a fundamental by a simple experiment.    [Footnote 5: For fuller exposition see Tyndall on _Sound_, or the  section devoted to _Acoustics_ in any text-book on Physics.]    The overtones arrange themselves in a definite order, as follows: (1)  the fundamental or prime tone; (2) an overtone one octave above the  fundamental; (3) an overtone a fifth above No. 2; (4) an overtone a  fourth above No. 3 (two octaves above the fundamental); (5) an  overtone a major third above No. 4; (6) an overtone a minor third  above No. 5. There are others in still higher range but those  indicated are easily demonstrated on the piano. For C they would be as  follows:      [Music illustration]    Experiment I    Step to your piano, noiselessly press and hold down the key of No. 2,  then strike the fundamental No. 1, with force and immediately release  it. As a result No. 2 will sound clearly, and if your ears are keen  you will at the same time hear No. 6. In succession hold down the keys  of 3, 4, 5, and 6, while you strike and release the fundamental No. 1.  If your piano is \"in tune\" you will probably hear No. 6 when holding  the key of any other note of the series.    In a musical tone of rich quality the overtones just indicated are  present in their fulness, while tone that is weak and thin is made so  by the absence or weakness of the overtones. I have stated that the  quality of a tone depends on the _form_ of its vibrations, and that  the form of its vibrations is determined by the character of the  _resonator_. We can now amplify this by saying that while the relative  presence or absence of overtones determines the clang or color of a  tone, their presence or absence is determined by the _character of the  resonance_.    An English writer records that he was once in the garden at the back  of a house while a gentleman was singing in the drawing-room. The  tone-quality was good, and the pitch so unusually high he hastened to  learn who sang tenor high C so beautifully. On entering the room,  instead of the tenor he had supposed, he found the singer was a  baritone, and the note sung was only middle C. The fundamental tone  had not reached him in the garden but the first overtone, an octave  above it, had. Concrete illustrations will make the subject still  clearer.      Experiment II    If an ordinary tuning-fork when vibrating is held in the hand its  intrinsic tone is too weak to carry far. Rest the handle of the  vibrating fork on a bare table or the panel of the door, and the sound  is greatly augmented. _The vibrations of the fork have by contact  induced similar vibrations in the wooden table or panel which  reinforce the primary tone._      Experiment III    Place the handle of the vibrating tuning-fork on a small upturned  empty box, or, better still, in contact with the body of a violin, and  the sound will be stronger than in the previous experiment, because to  the vibrations of the wood are added the vibrations of the air  enclosed in the box or the violin. _To the resonance of the wood has  been added the sympathetic resonance of the confined air._      Experiment IV    Hold the vibrating fork over the mouth of an empty fruit-jar and there  will probably be little or no reinforcement; but gently pour in water,  thereby shortening the air column within the jar, and the sound of the  fork will be gradually intensified until at a certain point it becomes  quite loud. If you pour in still more water the sound will gradually  become feebler. This shows that _for every tone an air column of a  certain size most powerfully reinforces that tone_.      Experiment V    As a sequence to the last experiment, take two fruit-jars of the same  size, and, having learned to what point to fill them for the greatest  resonance, fill one jar (after warming it) to the required point with  hot water, the other with cold water, and you will find that the  resonance of the heated, therefore expanded, air is much less than the  denser air of the cold jar. This shows that _the degree of density of  the air affects its resonance_.      Experiment VI    To demonstrate the resonance of the oral cavity, apart from the voice,  hold a vibrating tuning-fork before the open mouth. Vary the shape and  size of the cavity until the sound of the fork suddenly increases in  volume, showing that the right adjustment for resonance has been made.  _This intensification of the sound is due to the vibration of the air  in the mouth cavity, together with the sympathetic vibration of the  surrounding walls._      Experiment VII    As an illustration of sympathetic resonance without contact, sing  forcibly a tone that is within easy range, and at the same time  silently hold down the corresponding key of the piano. On ceasing to  sing you will hear the tone sounding in the piano. This may be further  illustrated by playing on the open string of one violin while another,  tuned to the same pitch, rests untouched near by. Through _sympathetic  resonance_ the corresponding string of the second violin will vibrate  and sound its note. The louder the first violin is played the louder  will be the sympathetic tone of the second.    The deep pedal-tones of a church organ often induce sympathetic  resonance that may be felt beneath the feet of the listener. One  writer, a singer, speaks of living in the same house with two  deaf-mutes. He lodged on the first floor, they on the third. One day,  meeting at luncheon, one of the deaf-mutes told the singer that he had  begun practice earlier that morning than usual. Surprised, the writer  asked how he knew. The deaf-mute replied that they always knew when he  was singing because they felt the floor of their room vibrate.    If tone vibrations can be transmitted so readily throughout a house,  it is not difficult to understand how easily the vibrations of bone  and tissue can be transmitted until the whole framework of the body  responds in perceptible vibration.    It is said that Pascal at the age of twelve wrote a dissertation on  acoustics suggested by his childish discovery that when a metal dish  was struck by a knife the resulting sound could be stopped by touching  the vibrating dish with a finger.    With this in mind it is not difficult to understand how compression of  the human instrument by the pressure of tight clothing without, or by  false muscular tension within, must interfere with its free vibration  and so rob the produced tone of just so much of perfection.    From these experiments we can understand that, while the tones of the  voice are initiated by or at the vocal cords, the volume and character  of the tones are dependent upon _resonance_,--the vibration of the air  in the various resonance chambers of the body, together with the  sympathetic vibration of the walls of these chambers and the bony  framework that supports them.    In respect to resonance, as in other respects, the human voice is far  superior to all other instruments, for their resonators are fixed and  unchanging, while the human resonator is flexible,--in Helmholtz's  words \"admits of much variety of form, so that many more qualities of  tone can be thus produced than on any instrument of artificial  construction.\"    We are now prepared to realize the error of the common notion that  loudness of tone is due entirely to increase of breath pressure on the  vocal cords. Simple experiments with the tuning-fork have shown that  while the volume of sound it gives forth is due in part to the  amplitude of its vibrations, its loudness is _chiefly_ due to the  character of the _resonance_ provided for it.    The larger the resonance chamber the greater is its reinforcing  capacity. The largest air chamber in the body is the chest, which  serves not only as a wind-chest, but as a resonance chamber. The  necessity for chest expansion, therefore, is not, as generally  supposed, merely for air, but to increase its size as a resonance  chamber.    In view of the laws of tone, how great is the common error of speaking  of the larynx as if it alone were the vocal organ, when the principal  vibrations are _above_ the vocal cords in the chambers of _resonance_!    Since the musical value, the beauty of tone, as well as its volume,  comes only from right use of the resonator, our principal business  must be the acquiring control of the vibratory air current _above the  larynx_. The acquirement of this control involves the proper focusing  or placing of the tone, with the free uncramped use of all the vocal  organs; power will then take care of itself.          CHAPTER VII    HEAD AND NASAL RESONANCE      Of the four component factors in the production of speech and song,  the first, the _motor_, has been considered in Chapter III, and the  second, the _vibrator_, in Chapter I.    In one respect there is marked contrast between these two factors.  Until right habits are so thoroughly formed that the singer's  breathing is automatically controlled, conscious effort is necessary,  while the action of the vibrator, the vocal cords, is involuntary, not  subject to conscious control.    The subtle adjustments of the delicate mechanism of the larynx belong  to the realm of reflex action--to a spontaneous activity that, left  unhindered, does its part in perfect nicety.    The vocal cords must, in their action, be free from the disturbance of  uncontrolled breath action below them, or the hindrance due to  misdirected effort above them. To direct consciousness to the vocal  cords is to cramp them and prevent that free vibration and that  perfect relaxation of the throat without which pure tone and true  pitch are impossible.    As a surgeon I well know the value of thorough anatomical knowledge,  but from the singer's standpoint I cannot too strongly emphasize the  unwisdom of directing the attention of sensitively organized pupils"]]]
