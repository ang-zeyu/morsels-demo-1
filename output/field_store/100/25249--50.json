In the distance they leapt savagely  at the base of the now lowering headlands, and fought madly over the  hidden rocks and sands.  They sent their sleet and foam-flakes before  them, blinding us where we stood on the cliff-top; they seethed and  boiled in the hollows of the rocks, and over the river bar they dashed  and plunged till far up the stream their fury scarcely spent itself.    At such times no ship or boat ventured willingly into Colveston Bay; or  if it did, it rarely, if ever, left it again.    But such times were rare--very rare with us.  Indeed, I had been months  at Parkhurst before I witnessed a real storm, and months again before I  saw another.  So that my acquaintance with the bay was almost altogether  connected with its milder aspects, and as such it appeared both  fascinating and tempting.    It was on a beautiful August holiday morning that four of us were  lounging lazily in a boat down at the bar mouth, looking out into the  bay and watching the progress of a little fishing smack, which was  skipping lightly over the bright waves in the direction of Shargle Head.  Her sails gleamed in the sunlight, and she herself skimmed so lightly  across the waters, and bounded so merrily through their sparkling  ripples, that she seemed more like a fairy craft than a real yacht of  boards and canvas.  \"I'd give a good deal to be in her!\" exclaimed Hall,  one of our party, a sea captain's son, to whom on all nautical matters  we accorded the amplest deference.  \"So would I,\" said Hutton.  \"How  jolly she looks!\"    \"Ever so much more fun than knocking about on this stupid old river,\"  chimed in I.    \"I say, you fellows,\" cried Hall, struck by a sudden idea, \"why  shouldn't we have a little cruise in the bay?  It would be glorious a  day like this!\"    \"I'm not sure old Rogers,\" (that was the disrespectful way in which, I  regret to say, we were wont to designate Dr Rogers, our head master)  \"would like it,\" I said; \"he's got some notion into his head about  currents and tides, and that makes him fidgety.\"    \"Currents and fiddlesticks!\" broke in Hall, with a laugh; \"what does  _he_ know about them?  I tell you, a day like this, with a good sailing  breeze, and four of us to row, in case it dropped, there'd be no more  difficulty in going over there and back than there would in rowing from  here back to Parkhurst.\"    \"How long would it take to get to Shargle?\" inquired Hutton.    \"Why, only two hours, and perhaps less.  The wind's exactly right for  going and coming back too.  We can be back by four easily, and that  allows us an hour or two to land there.\"    It certainly was tempting; the day was perfection, and Colveston Bay had  never looked more fascinating.  The headlands stood out so distinctly in  the clear air that it was hard to imagine Shargle Head was five miles  distant from where we sat.    When the proposition had first been made I had felt a passing  uncomfortableness as to the lawfulness of such an expedition without the  distinct sanction of the head master; but the more I gazed on the bay,  and the more Hall talked in his enthusiastic manner of the delights of a  cruise, and the longer I watched the fairy-like progress of the little  white-sailed fishing-boat, the less I thought of anything but the  pleasure which the scheme offered.    So when Hall said, \"Shall we go, boys?  What do you say?\"  I for one  replied, \"All serene.\"    All this while one of our party had been silent, watching the fishing-  boat, but taking no part in our discussion.  He was Charlie Archer, a  new boy at Parkhurst, and some years our junior.  But from the first I  had taken a remarkable fancy to this clever, good-humoured, plucky boy,  who henceforth had become my frequent companion, and with me the  companion of the others who now composed our party.  He now looked up  and said, greatly to our surprise--    \"I say, I don't want to go!\"    \"Why not?\" we all asked.    \"Oh, it doesn't matter,\" he replied, in evident confusion.  \"I don't  want to spoil your fun, you know, but I'd rather not go myself.\"    \"Why, what on earth's the matter with you, Charlie?\"  I asked.  \"I  thought you were always ready for an adventure.\"    \"I'd rather not go, please,\" he repeated.  \"You can put me ashore.\"    \"Why not?\" again inquired Hall, this time testily.  He never liked  Charlie quite as much as Hutton and I did, and was evidently displeased  to have him now putting forward objections to a proposition of his own  making.  \"Why not?\"    \"Because--because,\" began the boy hesitatingly--\"because I don't want to  go.\"    Hall became angry.  Like most boys not sure of the honesty of their own  motives, he disliked to have it suggested that what he was urging was  wrong.  He therefore replied, with a taunt keener than any persuasion--    \"Poor little milksop, I suppose he's afraid of getting drowned, or of  doing something his mamma, or his grandmamma, or somebody wouldn't like  their little pet to do.  We'd better put him ashore, boys; and mind his  precious little boots don't get wet while we're about it!\"    It was a cruel blow, and struck home at Archer's one weak point.    Plucky and adventurous as he was, the one thing he could not endure was  to be laughed at.  And his face flushed, and his lips quivered, as he  heard Hall's brutal speech, and marked the smile with which, I am  ashamed to say, we received it.    \"I'm _not_ afraid,\" he exclaimed.    \"Then why don't you want to go?\"    He was silent for some time.  A struggle was evidently going on in his  mind.  But the sneer on Hall's face determined him.    \"I do want to go.  I've changed my mind!\"    \"That's the style,\" said Hutton, patting him on the back.  \"I knew you  were one of the right sort.\"    Hall, too, condescended to approve of his decision, and at once began to  busy himself with preparations for our immediate start.    I, however, was by no means comfortable at what had taken place.  It was  plain to see Charlie had yielded against his better judgment, and that  with whatever alacrity he might now throw himself into the scheme, his  mind was not easy.  Had I been less selfishly inclined towards my own  pleasure, I should have sided with him in his desire not to engage in a  questionable proceeding; but, alas! my wishes in this case had ruled my  conscience.  Still, I made one feeble effort on Archer's behalf.    \"Hall,\" whispered I, as I stooped with him to disengage the ropes at the  bottom of the boat, \"what's the use of taking Charlie when he doesn't  want to go?  We may as well put him ashore if he'd sooner not go.\"    \"Archer,\" said Hall, looking up from his ropes, \"did you say you wanted  to go, or not?\"    The question was accompanied by a look which made it hard for the boy to  reply anything but--    \"I want to go.\"    \"And it's your own free will, eh?\"    \"Yes.\"    So ended my weak effort.  If only I had been more determined to do  right; if, alas!  I had imagined a thousandth part of what that day was  to bring forth, I would have set Archer ashore, whether he would or not,  even if to do so had cost me my life.    But this is anticipating.    For half an hour we were busy getting our boat trim for her voyage.  She  was a somewhat old craft, in which for many years past we had been wont  to cruise down the seaward reaches of the Colven, carrying one lug-sail,  and with thwarts for two pairs of oars.  She was steady on her keel,  and, as far as we had been able to judge, sound in every respect, and a  good sailor.  Certainly, on a day like this, a cockleshell would have  had nothing to fear, and we were half sorry we had not a lighter boat  than the one we were in to take us across to Shargle.    Hall, who assumed the command from the first, impressed us not a little  by the businesslike way in which he set to work to get everything ship-  shape before starting.  He knew clearly the use of each rope and pulley;  he knew precisely the necessary amount of ballast to be taken, and the  proper place for stowing it; he discoursed learnedly on knots and  hitches, and aroused our sympathy by his laments on the absence of a  bowsprit and foresail.  Hutton was sent ashore to buy provisions.  Charlie was set to baling out the boat.  I occupied myself with mopping  the seats, and generally \"swabbing her up,\" as Hall called it, so that  in due time we were ready to sail, well provisioned and well equipped,  on our eventful voyage.    Up went the sail; we watched it first flap wildly, and then swell  proudly in the wind as the sheet rope was drawn in, and Hall's hand put  round the helm.  Then, after a little coquetting, as if she were loth to  act as desired without coaxing, she rose lightly to the rippling waves,  and glided forward on her way.    \"Adams,\" said Hall, \"you'd better make yourself snug up in the bows;  Hutton, sit where you are, and be ready to help me with the sail when we  tack.  Charlie, old boy, come down astern, beside me; sit a little  farther over, Hutton.  Now she's trim.\"    Trim she was, and a strange feeling of exhilaration filled my breast as  we now darted forward before the steady breeze, dancing over the waves  with a merry splash, tossing them to either side of our prow, and  listening to them as they gurgled musically under our keel.    \"There's Neil!\" cried Charlie, as we passed the coastguards' boathouse,  \"spying at us through the telescope.\"    \"Let him spy,\" laughed Hall; \"I dare say he'd like to be coming too.  It's slow work for those fellows, always hanging about doing nothing.\"    \"What's he waving about?\" inquired I from the bows, for we could see  that the sailor had put down his glass, and was apparently trying to  catch our attention by his gesticulations.    Hall looked attentively for a moment, and then said--    \"Oh, I see, he's pointing up at the flagstaff to show us the wind's in  the north-east"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#9)"],[1,"books. I want to know, for instance, how the bird turns.  What does it do with one wing, what with the other? Fancy the pace that  has to be stopped; the force of bridle-hand put out in an instant.  Fancy how the wings must bend with the strain; what need there must be  for the perfect aid and work of every feather in them. There is a  problem for you, students of mechanics,--How does a swallow turn?    You shall see, at all events, to begin with, to-day, how it gets along.    65. I say you shall see; but indeed you have often seen, and felt,--at  least with your hands, if not with your shoulders,--when you chanced to  be holding the sheet of a sail.    I have said that I never got into scrapes by blaming people wrongly;  but I often do by praising them wrongly. I never praised, without  qualification, but one scientific book in my life (that I  remember)--this of Dr. Pettigrew's on the Wing;[12] and now I must  qualify my praise considerably, discovering, when I examined the book  farther, that the good doctor had described the motion of a bird as  resembling that of a kite, without ever inquiring what, in a bird,  represented that somewhat important part of a kite, the string. You  will, however, find the book full of important observations, and  illustrated by valuable drawings. But the point in question you must  settle for yourselves, and you easily may. Some of you perhaps, knew,  in your time, better than the doctor, how a kite stopped; but I do not  doubt that a great many of you also know, now, what is much more to the  purpose, how a ship gets along. I will take the simplest, the most  natural, the most beautiful of sails,--the lateen sail of the  Mediterranean.

I cannot sufficiently        express either my wonder or regret at the petulance in which men        of science are continually tempted into immature publicity, by        their rivalship with each other. Page after page of this book,        which, slowly digested and taken counsel upon, might have been a        noble contribution to natural history, is occupied with dispute        utterly useless to the reader, on the question of the priority of        the author, by some months, to a French savant, in the statement        of a principle which neither has yet proved; while page after        page is rendered worse than useless to the reader by the author's        passionate endeavor to contradict the ideas of unquestionably        previous investigators. The problem of flight was, to all serious        purpose, solved by Borelli in 1680, and the following passage is        very notable as an example of the way in which the endeavor to        obscure the light of former ages too fatally dims and distorts        that by which modern men of science walk, themselves. \"Borelli,        and all who have written since his time, are unanimous in        affirming that the horizontal transference of the body of the        bird is due to the perpendicular vibration of the wings, and to        the yielding of the posterior or flexible margins of the wings in        an upward direction, as the wings descend. I\" (Dr. Pettigrew)        \"am, however, disposed to attribute it to the fact (1st), that        _the wings_, both when elevated and depressed, _leap forwards_ in        curves, those curves uniting to form a continuous waved track;        (2d), _to the tendency which the body of the bird has to swing        forwards_, in a more or less horizontal direction, _when once set        in motion_; (3d), to the construction of the wings; they are        elastic helices or screws, which twist and untwist while they        vibrate, _and tend to bear upwards and onwards any weight        suspended from them_; (4th), _to the action of the air on the        under surfaces_ of the wings; (5th), _to the ever-varying power        with which the wings are urged_, this being greatest at the        beginning of the down-stroke, and least at the end of the up one;        (6th), _to the contraction of the voluntary muscles_ and elastic        ligaments, and to the effect produced by the various inclined        surfaces formed by the wings during their oscillations; (7th),        _to the weight of the bird_--weight itself, when acting upon        wings, becoming a propelling power, and so contributing to        horizontal motion.\"          I will collect these seven reasons for the forward motion, in the        gist of them, which I have marked by italics, that the reader may        better judge of their collective value. The bird is carried        forward, according to Dr. Pettigrew--          1. Because its wings leap forward.          2. Because its body has a tendency to swing forward.          3. Because its wings are screws so constructed as to screw        upwards and onwards any body suspended from them.          4. Because the air reacts on the under surfaces of the wings.          5. Because the wings are urged with ever-varying power.          6. Because the voluntary muscles contract.          7. Because the bird is heavy.          What must be the general conditions of modern science, when it is        possible for a man of great experimental knowledge and practical        ingenuity, to publish nonsense such as this, becoming, to all        intents and purposes, insane, in the passion of his endeavor to        overthrow the statements of his rival? Had he merely taken        patience to consult any elementary scholar in dynamics, he would        have been enabled to understand his own machines, and develop,        with credit to himself, what had been rightly judged or noticed        by others.    66. I draw it rudely in outline, as it would be set for a side-wind on  the boat you probably know best,--the boat of burden on the Lake of  Geneva (Fig. 3), not confusing the drawing by adding the mast, which,  you know, rakes a little, carrying the yard across it (_a_). Then, with  your permission, I will load my boat thus, with a few casks of Vevay  vintage--and, to keep them cool, we will put an awning over them, so  (_b_). Next, as we are classical scholars, instead of this rustic stern  of the boat, meant only to run easily on a flat shore, we will give it  an Attic [Greek: embolon] (_c_). (We have no business, indeed, yet, to  put an [Greek: embolon] on a boat of burden, but I hope some day to see  all our ships of war loaded with bread and wine, instead of artillery.)  Then I shade the entire form (_c_); and, lastly, reflect it in the  water (_d_)--and you have seen something like that before, besides a  boat, haven't you?    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    There is the gist of the whole business for you, put in very small  space; with these only differences: in a boat, the air strikes the  sail; in a bird, the sail strikes the air: in a boat, the force is  lateral, and in a bird downwards; and it has its sail on both sides. I  shall leave you to follow out the mechanical problem for yourselves, as  far as the mere resolution of force is concerned. My business, as a  painter, is only with the exquisite organic weapon that deals with it.    67. Of which you are now to note farther, that a bird is required to  manage his wing so as to obtain two results with one blow:--he has to  keep himself up, as well as to get along.    But observe, he only requires to keep himself up _because_ he has to  get along. The buoyancy might have been given at once, if nature had  wanted _that_ only; she might have blown the feathers up with the hot  air of the breath, till the bird rose in air like a cork in water. But  it has to be, not a buoyant cork, but a buoyant _bullet_. And therefore  that it may have momentum for pace, it must have weight to carry; and  to carry that weight, the wings must deliver their blow with effective  vertical, as well as oblique, force.    Here, again, you may take the matter in brief sum. Whatever is the  ship's loss, is the bird's gain; whatever tendency the ship has to  leeway, is all given to the bird's support, so that every atom[13] of  force in the blow is of service.          [13] I don't know what word to use for an infinitesimal degree or        divided portion of force: one cannot properly speak of a force        being cut into pieces; but I can think of no other word than        atom.    68. Therefore you have to construct your organic weapon, so that this  absolutely and perfectly economized force may be distributed as the  bird chooses at any moment. That, if it wants to rise, it may be able  to strike vertically more than obliquely;--if the order is, go-ahead,  that it may put the oblique screw on. If it wants to stop in an  instant, that it may be able to throw its wings up full to the wind; if  it wants to hover, that it may be able to lay itself quietly on the  wind with its wings and tail, or, in calm air, to regulate their  vibration and expansion into tranquillity of gliding, or of pausing  power. Given the various proportions of weight and wing; the conditions  of possible increase of muscular force and quill-strength in proportion  to size; and the different objects and circumstances of flight,--you  have a series of exquisitely complex problems, and exquisitely perfect  solutions, which the life of the youngest among you cannot be long  enough to read through so much as once, and of which the future  infinitudes of human life, however granted or extended, never will be  fatigued in admiration.    69. I take the rude outline of sail in Fig. 3, and now considering it  as a jib of one of our own sailing vessels, slightly exaggerate the  loops at the edge, and draw curved lines from them to the opposite  point, Fig. 4; and I have a reptilian or dragon's wing, which would,  with some ramification of the supporting ribs, become a bat's or  moth's; that is to say, an extension of membrane between the ribs (as"]]]
