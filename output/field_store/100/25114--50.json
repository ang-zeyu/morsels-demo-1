It should be noted that there certainly seems to  be some connection between the _Uinal_ period glyph and the lizard. Pl.  13, fig. 9, represents a _Uinal_ glyph from the Temple of the Foliated  Cross at Palenque and the lizard form is clearly seen in the eyebrow and  the upper jaw. Compare also Pl. 13, fig. 11, and Pl. 28, fig. 3. A  collection of glyphs of this period shows clearly the lizard-like  character of the face.    That some connection existed between the lizard and the idea of rain  seems clear from a reference in the _Relacion de la Ciudad de Merida_  (1900, p. 51).[319-*] Finally the lizard is shown in Dresden 3a (Pl. 12,  fig. 11) directly in front of god H beside the scene of human sacrifice.    CROCODILE. The text figure (1) shows a dorsal view of a crocodile (Maya,  _ayin_) carved on the top of Altar T at Copan. The general form is  considerably conventionalized with limbs elongated and provided with  human hands and long toes. The protuberances of the back are roughly  shown by oval markings, which are here continued on the legs. The large  scales of the ventral surfaces also appear at the sides of the body, and  along the posterior edges of the limbs. The tail is shortened and  bifurcate. The most interesting portion, however, is the head. The snout  is distinctly pinched in at the base, though broadened again distally.  In the alligator the snout is broad and tapers but little. As in other  representations of the crocodile, the lower jaw does not appear, and  even in this dorsal view the artist seems to have deemed it necessary to  show the row of teeth as if in side view, or as though they projected  laterally from the mouth. What may represent ears or ear plugs are shown  one on each side behind the eyes. There are few other examples of full  drawings of the crocodile in the Maya writings. Dresden 74 shows an  animal which has been considered to represent a crocodile or alligator  but it seems to have more of the characteristics of a lizard.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.  TOP OF ALTAR. T. COPAN.]    Figures of a crocodile (_Crocodilus americanus_) are frequent in the  Nuttall Codex, where there is one large figure of the entire animal (Pl.  13, fig. 8), making its way along under water. It is shown with numerous  dorsal spines, a long tail, and powerful claws. Curiously, however, it  has no lower jaw and the same is true of the numerous glyphs  representing the head of the animal. This is so pronounced a  characteristic, that it may be doubted if the open-mouthed head and the  single limb shown in Pl. 13, fig. 2, really picture the same animal,  though otherwise apparently referable to the crocodile. In the various  glyphs showing the head of this species, the prominent, elongate eyebrow  and the absence of the lower jaw are noteworthy points, while the teeth  may vary in number from three to six.    The glyphs (Pl. 13, figs. 1, 3-7) represent the Nahua day sign  _Cipactli_ corresponding to the Maya day _Imix_. In the band of  constellation signs in Dresden 52b (Pl. 13, fig. 10), there occurs a  single figure with a long curled eyebrow and lacking the lower jaw. In  the upper jaw three teeth are indicated. A comparison of this figure  with the glyphs in the Nuttall Codex seems to leave little doubt that it  represents a crocodile. This is the sign which Foerstemann (1906, p. 206)  interprets as standing for Saturn. Pl. 13, fig. 12, is certainly the  same sign as it stands in relatively the same position in the  constellation band on Dresden 53a. It represents the highly  conventionalized head of a crocodile. On Stela 10 from Piedras Negras  (Maler, 1901-1903, Pl. 19) the same glyph is seen.    The range of the alligator in North America does not extend to Yucatan,  hence the crocodile, which does occur there, is taken as the original of  all these figures. There is nothing in the latter that would distinguish  it from the alligator.    TURTLES. Representations of the turtle (Maya, _ak_) are not uncommon  among the Mayas. At Uxmal there is a ruined building called _Casa de las  Tortugas_ on which at intervals around the cornice there are carvings of  turtles. Turtles of at least two species occur in the Tro-Cortesianus.  With one exception, they seem to be limited to this codex. That shown on  Pl. 14, figs. 1-3, 5, is a large species with the dorsal scutes  represented by large diamond-shaped pieces. There is little that might  be considered distinctive about these turtles, although one (Pl. 14,  fig. 5) has the anterior paddles much larger than the posterior,  indicating a sea turtle. What is doubtless the same turtle is pictured  in several places in the Nuttall Codex. In one of the figures in the  latter manuscript, the shell is shown apparently in use as a shield (Pl.  14, fig. 4). This would indicate one of the large sea turtles, and there  is not much doubt that either the Loggerhead turtle (_Thalassochelys  cephalo_) or the Hawksbill (_Chelone imbricata_) is here intended.    Quite another species is that shown in Pl. 14, fig. 6. That this is a  freshwater turtle is plainly indicated by the parasitic leeches that are  noted fastened by their round sucking-discs to the sides of its body.  The long neck, pointed snout, and apparent limitation of the dorsal  spinous scutes to the central area of the back may indicate the snapping  turtle (_Chelydra serpentina_) or possibly a species of the genus  _Cinosternum_ (probably _C. leucostomum_). It is hardly likely that it  is one of the true soft-shelled turtles (_Trionyx_), as the range of  that genus is not known to include Mexico. The turtle from Nuttall 43  (Pl. 14, fig. 11) may belong to the same species as its scutes seem  rather few, or it may be that the view shown here is of the ventral side  and that the scales indicate the small plastron of one of the sea  turtles.    The turtle appears alone as one of the figures in the _tonalamatl_ in  several cases in the Tro-Cortesianus, 13a, 17a (Pl. 14, fig. 3), 72b  (Pl. 14, fig. 6). It is found associated with the toad appearing in the  rain in Tro-Cortesianus 17b (Pl. 14, fig. 2) and alone in the rain in  13a. In Tro-Cortesianus 81c (Pl. 14, fig. 5), it appears in front of an  unidentifiable god.    Schellhas has called the turtle an animal symbolical of the lightning  basing his opinion, as Brinton (1895, p. 74) tells us, on Dresden 40b  where a human figure with animal head is holding two torches in his  hands. This figure does not seem to us to represent a turtle, as is  commonly supposed, but a parrot, as will be pointed out later (p. 343).  Foerstemann (1902, p. 27) identifies the turtle with the summer  solstice, as has been noted before, explaining that the animal is slow  of motion, and is taken to represent the time when the sun seems to  stand still. He bases his theory (1904, p. 423) in part on the fact that  the sign for the Maya month _Kayab_, which is the month in which the  summer solstice occurs, shows the face of the turtle (Pl. 14, fig. 10).  This undoubtedly is correct, but he seems to us wrong in classing as  turtles the figure in Dresden 40b (Pl. 25, fig. 1) with its accompanying  glyph (Pl. 25, fig. 6).    The turtle is found in connection with two sun (_kin_) signs beneath a  constellation band in Tro-Cortesianus 71a. Resting upon his body are  three _Cauac_ signs. The single representation of the turtle in the  Dresden Codex is on page 49 (Pl. 14, fig. 12) where a god is pictured  with a turtle's head. The heavy sharp beak indicates that he represents  one of the sea turtles previously mentioned. He is shown transfixed by a  spear and corresponds to the other figures in the lower parts of pp.  46-50. These all have some connection with the Venus period which is  considered in these pages.[323-*]    A number of glyphs representing the turtle are found throughout the  codices (Pl. 14, figs. 7-10). They are all characterized by the heavy  beak. It may be noted that these glyphs are virtually the same as the  sign for the first _a_ in Landa's alphabet. As the turtle is called _ak_  or _aak_ in Maya, the reason is clear for the selection of this sign for  an _a_ sound. These turtle glyphs often occur alone; one, however, (Pl.  14, fig. 7) is found in connection with the swimming turtle in  Tro-Cortesianus 17a (Pl. 14, fig. 3). Figs. 7-9 agree in having the  small scrolls at the posterior end of the eye. The head shown in Pl. 14,  fig. 10, has quite a different eye, though otherwise similar. Its  resemblance to the glyph on Pl. 25, fig. 9, is marked and suggests the  parrot. Schellhas (1904, p. 44) gives in his fig. 64, a glyph for the  turtle which seems clearly to be a glyph for the parrot (Pl. 25, fig.  7).      AVES    HERONS (_Ardea herodias_; _Hydranassa tricolor ruficollis_). Only a few  water birds are shown in the Maya works. Several are found, however,  that seem to picture herons (Pl. 15, figs. 1-7). The best of these (fig.  5), a carving from the west side panel of the Temple of the Cross at  Palenque shows a crested heron standing on one foot and holding in its  bill a fish. A second figure (Pl. 15, fig. 1) is from the stucco  ornament from the Palace, House B, at Palenque. It is less carefully  executed, but seems to be a long-necked bird with a crest and outspread  wings curiously conventionalized. In the Nuttall Codex there is another  unmistakable heron (Pl. 15, fig. 4) with the same general  characteristics, though the crest is less prominent, here represented as  a series of erectile feathers separated at their tips. This elongation  of the crest seems to be carried still farther in what seems to be the  head and neck of a heron from Dresden 37b (Pl. 15, fig. 3) with erectile  feathers at intervals along its length.    The heron is seldom employed as a head-dress.

I am not much  given to liking anybody at first sight, but these people impressed me  much more favourably than I should have thought possible, so that I could  not fear them as I scanned their faces one after another.  They were all  powerful men.  I might have been a match for any one of them singly, for  I have been told that I have more to glory in the flesh than in any other  respect, being over six feet and proportionately strong; but any two  could have soon mastered me, even were I not so bereft of energy by my  recent adventures.  My colour seemed to surprise them most, for I have  light hair, blue eyes, and a fresh complexion.  They could not understand  how these things could be; my clothes also seemed quite beyond them.  Their eyes kept wandering all over me, and the more they looked the less  they seemed able to make me out.    At last I raised myself upon my feet, and leaning upon my stick, I spoke  whatever came into my head to the man who seemed foremost among them.  I  spoke in English, though I was very sure that he would not understand.  I  said that I had no idea what country I was in; that I had stumbled upon  it almost by accident, after a series of hairbreadth escapes; and that I  trusted they would not allow any evil to overtake me now that I was  completely at their mercy.  All this I said quietly and firmly, with  hardly any change of expression.  They could not understand me, but they  looked approvingly to one another, and seemed pleased (so I thought) that  I showed no fear nor acknowledgment of inferiority--the fact being that I  was exhausted beyond the sense of fear.  Then one of them pointed to the  mountain, in the direction of the statues, and made a grimace in  imitation of one of them.  I laughed and shuddered expressively, whereon  they all burst out laughing too, and chattered hard to one another.  I  could make out nothing of what they said, but I think they thought it  rather a good joke that I had come past the statues.  Then one among them  came forward and motioned me to follow, which I did without hesitation,  for I dared not thwart them; moreover, I liked them well enough, and felt  tolerably sure that they had no intention of hurting me.    In about a quarter of an hour we got to a small hamlet built on the side  of a hill, with a narrow street and houses huddled up together.  The  roofs were large and overhanging.  Some few windows were glazed, but not  many.  Altogether the village was exceedingly like one of those that one  comes upon in descending the less known passes over the Alps on to  Lombardy.  I will pass over the excitement which my arrival caused.  Suffice it, that though there was abundance of curiosity, there was no  rudeness.  I was taken to the principal house, which seemed to belong to  the people who had captured me.  There I was hospitably entertained, and  a supper of milk and goat's flesh with a kind of oatcake was set before  me, of which I ate heartily.  But all the time I was eating I could not  help turning my eyes upon the two beautiful girls whom I had first seen,  and who seemed to consider me as their lawful prize--which indeed I was,  for I would have gone through fire and water for either of them.    Then came the inevitable surprise at seeing me smoke, which I will spare  the reader; but I noticed that when they saw me strike a match, there was  a hubbub of excitement which, it struck me, was not altogether unmixed  with disapproval: why, I could not guess.  Then the women retired, and I  was left alone with the men, who tried to talk to me in every conceivable  way; but we could come to no understanding, except that I was quite  alone, and had come from a long way over the mountains.  In the course of  time they grew tired, and I very sleepy.  I made signs as though I would  sleep on the floor in my blankets, but they gave me one of their bunks  with plenty of dried fern and grass, on to which I had no sooner laid  myself than I fell fast asleep; nor did I awake till well into the  following day, when I found myself in the hut with two men keeping guard  over me and an old woman cooking.  When I woke the men seemed pleased,  and spoke to me as though bidding me good morning in a pleasant tone.    I went out of doors to wash in a creek which ran a few yards from the  house.  My hosts were as engrossed with me as ever; they never took their  eyes off me, following every action that I did, no matter how trifling,  and each looking towards the other for his opinion at every touch and  turn.  They took great interest in my ablutions, for they seemed to have  doubted whether I was in all respects human like themselves.  They even  laid hold of my arms and overhauled them, and expressed approval when  they saw that they were strong and muscular.  They now examined my legs,  and especially my feet.  When they desisted they nodded approvingly to  each other; and when I had combed and brushed my hair, and generally made  myself as neat and well arranged as circumstances would allow, I could  see that their respect for me increased greatly, and that they were by no  means sure that they had treated me with sufficient deference--a matter  on which I am not competent to decide.  All I know is that they were very  good to me, for which I thanked them heartily, as it might well have been  otherwise.    For my own part, I liked them and admired them, for their quiet  self-possession and dignified ease impressed me pleasurably at once.  Neither did their manner make me feel as though I were personally  distasteful to them--only that I was a thing utterly new and unlooked  for, which they could not comprehend.  Their type was more that of the  most robust Italians than any other; their manners also were eminently  Italian, in their entire unconsciousness of self.  Having travelled a  good deal in Italy, I was struck with little gestures of the hand and  shoulders, which constantly reminded me of that country.  My feeling was  that my wisest plan would be to go on as I had begun, and be simply  myself for better or worse, such as I was, and take my chance  accordingly.    I thought of these things while they were waiting for me to have done  washing, and on my way back.  Then they gave me breakfast--hot bread and  milk, and fried flesh of something between mutton and venison.  Their  ways of cooking and eating were European, though they had only a skewer  for a fork, and a sort of butcher's knife to cut with.  The more I looked  at everything in the house, the more I was struck with its quasi-European  character; and had the walls only been pasted over with extracts from the  _Illustrated London News_ and _Punch_, I could have almost fancied myself  in a shepherd's hut upon my master's sheep-run.  And yet everything was  slightly different.  It was much the same with the birds and flowers on  the other side, as compared with the English ones.  On my arrival I had  been pleased at noticing that nearly all the plants and birds were very  like common English ones: thus, there was a robin, and a lark, and a  wren, and daisies, and dandelions; not quite the same as the English, but  still very like them--quite like enough to be called by the same name; so  now, here, the ways of these two men, and the things they had in the  house, were all very nearly the same as in Europe.  It was not at all  like going to China or Japan, where everything that one sees is strange.  I was, indeed, at once struck with the primitive character of their  appliances, for they seemed to be some five or six hundred years behind  Europe in their inventions; but this is the case in many an Italian  village.    All the time that I was eating my breakfast I kept speculating as to what  family of mankind they could belong to; and shortly there came an idea  into my head, which brought the blood into my cheeks with excitement as I  thought of it.  Was it possible that they might be the lost ten tribes of  Israel, of whom I had heard both my grandfather and my father make  mention as existing in an unknown country, and awaiting a final return to  Palestine?  Was it possible that I might have been designed by Providence  as the instrument of their conversion?  Oh, what a thought was this!  I  laid down my skewer and gave them a hasty survey.  There was nothing of a  Jewish type about them: their noses were distinctly Grecian, and their  lips, though full, were not Jewish.    How could I settle this question?  I knew neither Greek nor Hebrew, and  even if I should get to understand the language here spoken, I should be  unable to detect the roots of either of these tongues.  I had not been  long enough among them to ascertain their habits, but they did not give  me the impression of being a religious people.  This too was natural: the  ten tribes had been always lamentably irreligious.  But could I not make  them change?  To restore the lost ten tribes of Israel to a knowledge of  the only truth: here would be indeed an immortal crown of glory!  My  heart beat fast and furious as I entertained the thought.  What a  position would it not ensure me in the next world; or perhaps even in  this!  What folly it would be to throw such a chance away!  I should rank  next to the Apostles, if not as high as they--certainly above the minor  prophets, and possibly above any Old Testament writer except Moses and  Isaiah.  For such a future as this I would sacrifice all that I have  without a moment's hesitation, could I be reasonably assured of it.  I  had always cordially approved of missionary efforts, and had at times  contributed my mite towards their support and extension; but I had never  hitherto felt drawn towards becoming a missionary myself; and indeed had  always admired, and envied, and respected them, more than I had exactly  liked them.  But if these people were the lost ten tribes of Israel, the  case would be widely different: the opening was too excellent to be"]]]
