A soft note which is taken with the  \"head voice\" without being supported by a breath taken from the  diaphragm is a helpless sort of thing. It does not carry and is  inaudible at any distance, whereas the soft note which does possess the  deep breath support is penetrating, concentrated and most expressive.    Another important point is that, with a \"piano\" note properly taken in  the register which is proper to it, there is no danger of having to  change the position of the throat and consequently the real character of  the note when making a crescendo and again diminishing it. It will be  the same note continuing to sound.    On the other hand, with a soft note taken in a register foreign to it,  as soon as its strength is augmented the register must suddenly be  changed and the result is like a Tyrolean yodel.    So remember in a mezza voce to see that the register is right and to use  a double breath strength. I speak of the matter of register here for the  benefit of those who must keep this constantly in mind. I myself have  been blessed with what is called a naturally placed voice, and never  had trouble with the mezza voce. The majority of Italian singers come to  it easily.    There are a number of wrong sorts of voices which should be mentioned to  be shunned--the \"white\" voice, the \"throaty\" voice, the \"nasal\" voice,  and the \"bleat.\" The nasal quality is the most difficult to correct.  Many teachers, especially the French, make a point of placing the voice  in the nasal cavity on the pretext of strengthening it, and this nasal  quality, partly on account of the sound of many of the French words, is  only too prevalent. The voice, however, can only be strengthened by  legitimate means; otherwise it can easily be ruined. One can breathe  through the nose, but never attack or sing through it.    The \"white voice\" (voce bianca) is a head voice without deep support and  consequently without color; hence its appellation. One can learn to  avoid it by practicing with the mouth closed and by taking care to  breathe through the nose, which forces the respiration to descend to the  abdomen.    The \"throaty\" voice comes from singing with the throat insufficiently  opened, so that the breath does not pass easily through the nose and  head cavities and, again, from not attacking the tone deeply enough.    To cure oneself of this throaty quality attack your notes from the  abdomen, the mouth well open, standing in front of a mirror. The force  of the respiration will keep the tongue depressed and the throat will  remain free.    As for the fault of nasality, it is, as I have said, the most difficult  to get rid of. Sometimes one never does lose it. The only remedy is what  I have previously indicated--to attack from the abdomen, with the  throat open, and carry the voice over the soft palate, for if the voice  is placed in the nose it indicates that one is singing too far forward,  which is against the rules of song. If the student has a tendency to  sing in this way it is well to practice in vowel sounds only  (ah-eh-ee-la-lay-lee, etc.) in order to be cured of this serious fault.    After all, however, those who have practiced the art of right breathing  need have none of the defects mentioned above.    The \"bleat\" or goat voice, a particular fault of French singers,  proceeds from the habit of forcing the voice, which, when it is of small  volume, cannot stand the consequent fatigue of the larynx. Many singers  with voices suitable only for light opera are constantly trying to  branch out into big dramatic arias. Such performances are assuredly  distressing to hear and are certainly disastrous for the voices  concerned. It is no wonder that these people are often ill, for one  cannot make such efforts without injuring the health. I realize that  they often do it to please their directors and to be obliging in an  emergency, but when they are down and out others will easily replace  them and they are heard from no more.    To keep the voice fresh for the longest possible time one should not  only never overstep his vocal \"means,\" but should limit his output as he  does the expenses of his purse.    There is only one way to cure a bleaty voice, and that is to cultivate  an absolute rest; then, on taking up singing again, to use the \"closed  mouth\" method until the time the strength of respiration shall be such  that one can open his mouth and let the restored voice take its course.    A few words on practicing with closed mouth may here be appropriate.  This method of study is really all that is necessary to place certain  voices, but is bad for others. It all depends on the formation of the  mouth and throat. For example, a singer troubled with the fault of  closing the throat too much should never work with the mouth closed.  When one can do it safely, however, it is a most excellent resource for  preparatory exercises in respiration. Since, as I have already  explained, breathing through the nose with closed mouth throws back the  respiration to the abdomen, it is best to do the exercise seated in a  comfortable, natural position.    Vocal work with closed mouth is also a powerful auxiliary to vocal  agility. Many great artists perform their daily vocal exercises with the  mouth shut, and I can personally testify to the excellency of this  practice. It most certainly strengthens the breathing powers and at the  same time rests the voice. But one should know how to do it properly. I  know of many badly fatigued voices that have been restored to their  normal condition in this way.    Singers, of all musicians, have the reputation of displaying the least  regard for time. In operatic work, however, with an orchestra to follow  or be followed, it is especially essential to observe a sane respect for  the proper tempo. Otherwise one is liable to get into immediate trouble  with the conductor. Of course I do not mean that one should sing in a  mechanical way and give nothing of one's own personality. This would  naturally rob the music of all charm. There are many singers who cannot  or will not count the time properly. There are those who sing without  method, who do not fit their breathing, which is really the regulator of  vocal performance, to the right periods, and who consequently are never  in time. They make all kinds of rallentandos where they are not  necessary, to gain time to recover the breath that they have not taken  when they should. It is not enough to give the notes their full value.  The rests, above all, should be carefully observed in order to have  sufficient opportunity to get a good breath and prepare for the next  phrase. It is this exactitude that gives certainty to one's rendition  and authority in singing--something many artists do not possess. A  singer may make all the efforts he desires and still keep the time, and  he _must_ keep it.    Those who roar most loudly rarely sing in time. They give every thought  to the volume of tone they are producing and do not bother themselves  about anything else. The right accents in music depend very much on the  exact time. Tone artists, while still making all their desired \"effects\"  in apparent freedom of style and delivery, nevertheless do not ever lose  sight of the time. Those who do are usually apt to be amateurs and are  not to be imitated.          Good Diction a Requisite      Good diction, or the art of pronouncing the words of a song or opera  properly and intelligently, is a matter sadly neglected by many singers,  and indeed is not considered important by a large proportion of the  audiences in this country, who do not understand foreign language, at  any rate. And in an opera sung in a language unknown to most of the  audience it is apparently unimportant whether the words are understood  or not as long as there is a general knowledge of the plot, and the main  consideration is, of course, the music.    Yet for those who are conversant with the language in which the opera is  written, how common an experience it is (in concert, also) to be able,  in spite of their linguistic knowledge, to understand little of what is  being sung, and what a drawback this really is! How many singers there  are who seem to turn all their attention to the production of beautiful  sounds and neglect in most cases the words that often are equally  beautiful, or should be!    One hears a great deal just now about the advisability of giving operas  in the native language, as it is done in France and Germany, and the  idea would seem to have its advantages, as has already been demonstrated  in some excellent performances of German, French and Italian operas in  English. But of what avail would such a project be if, after all, one  could not understand the words of his own language as they were sung?    The language might as well be Sanskrit or Chinese.    In France the matter of diction is probably given the greatest  attention, and singers at the Opera Comique, for instance, are noted for  their pure and distinct enunciation of every syllable. Indeed, it is as  much of a sine qua non there as good singing, if not more so, and the  numerous subtleties in the French language are difficult enough to  justify this special stress laid upon correct pronunciation.    It requires a very particular ability in a foreigner to attain the  atmosphere of perfect French to any very high degree. Italian is  generally considered an easier language to pronounce in song, as indeed  it is, all the vowel sounds being full and sonorous and lacking that  \"covered\" or mixed quality so often occurring in the French.  Nevertheless, Italian has its difficulties, particularly in the way of  distinctly enunciating the double consonants and proper division of the  liaisons, or combining of final vowels with initial vowels, and the  correct amount of softness to be given to the letter C.    All this, of course, is from the standpoint of those to whom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#9)"],[1,"erence--a prospect that could not fail to  attract the Female Sex in a mass.    But by some of my Readers the possibility of the identical appearance  of Priests and Women, under the new Legislation, may not be recognized;  if so, a word or two will make it obvious.    Imagine a woman duly decorated, according to the new Code; with the  front half (i.e. the half containing eye and mouth) red, and with the  hinder half green.  Look at her from one side.  Obviously you will see  a straight line, HALF RED, HALF GREEN.      [Illustration 5]    [ASCII approximation follows]    [for simplicity's sake, the circle is approximated as an octogon]                M          _____        /       \\ - C_      /           \\||   -  _     |             ||         -  _    A|- - - - - - -||B- - - - - -_-+(> (Eye)     |             ||      _  -      \\           /||_  -        \\ _____ / - D      Now imagine a Priest, whose mouth is at M, and whose front semicircle  (AMB) is consequently coloured red, while his hinder semicircle is  green; so that the diameter AB divides the green from the red.  If you  contemplate the Great Man so as to have your eye in the same straight  line as his dividing diameter (AB), what you will see will be a  straight line (CBD), of which ONE HALF (CB) WILL BE RED, AND THE OTHER  (BD) GREEN.  The whole line (CD) will be rather shorter perhaps than  that of a full-sized Woman, and will shade off more rapidly towards its  extremities; but the identity of the colours would give you an  immediate impression of identity of Class, making you neglectful of  other details.  Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which  threatened society at the time of the Colour Revolt; add too the  certainty that Women would speedily learn to shade off their  extremities so as to imitate the Circles; it must then be surely  obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a  great danger of confounding a Priest with a young Woman.    How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may  readily be imagined.  They anticipated with delight the confusion that  would ensue.  At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical  secrets intended not for them but for their husbands and brothers, and  might even issue commands in the name of a priestly Circle; out of  doors the striking combination of red and green, without addition of  any other colours, would be sure to lead the common people into endless  mistakes, and the Women would gain whatever the Circles lost, in the  deference of the passers by.  As for the scandal that would befall the  Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were  imputed to them, and as to the consequent subversion of the  Constitution, the Female Sex could not be expected to give a thought to  these considerations.  Even in the households of the Circles, the Women  were all in favour of the Universal Colour Bill.    The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization  of the Circles themselves.  In the general intellectual decay they  still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding.  From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular  households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved  the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that  result from that admirable training of the intellect.  Hence, up to the  date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had  not only held their own, but even increased their lead of the other  classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.    Now therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real  author of this diabolical Bill, determined at one blow to lower the  status of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit to the pollution of  Colour, and at the same time to destroy their domestic opportunities of  training in the Art of Sight Recognition, so as to enfeeble their  intellects by depriving them of their pure and colourless homes.  Once  subjected to the chromatic taint, every parental and every childish  Circle would demoralize each other.  Only in discerning between the  Father and the Mother would the Circular infant find problems for the  exercise of its understanding--problems too often likely to be  corrupted by maternal impostures with the result of shaking the child's  faith in all logical conclusions.  Thus by degrees the intellectual  lustre of the Priestly Order would wane, and the road would then lie  open for a total destruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for  the subversion of our Privileged Classes.          Section 10.  Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition        The agitation for the Universal Colour Bill continued for three years;  and up to the last moment of that period it seemed as though Anarchy  were destined to triumph.    A whole army of Polygons, who turned out to fight as private soldiers,  was utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles--the  Squares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral.  Worse than all,  some of the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal fury.  Infuriated by  political animosity, the wives in many a noble household wearied their  lords with prayers to give up their opposition to the Colour Bill; and  some, finding their entreaties fruitless, fell on and slaughtered their  innocent children and husband, perishing themselves in the act of  carnage.  It is recorded that during that triennial agitation no less  than twenty-three Circles perished in domestic discord.    Great indeed was the peril.  It seemed as though the Priests had no  choice between submission and extermination; when suddenly the course  of events was completely changed by one of those picturesque incidents  which Statesmen ought never to neglect, often to anticipate, and  sometimes perhaps to originate, because of the absurdly  disproportionate power with which they appeal to the sympathies of the  populace.    It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at  all above four degrees--accidentally dabbling in the colours of some  Tradesman whose shop he had plundered--painted himself, or caused  himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of  a Dodecagon.  Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned  voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection  in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series of  deceptions--aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents too  long to relate, and on the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity  and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the  bride--he succeeded in consummating the marriage.  The unhappy girl  committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been  subjected.    When the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State the minds  of the Women were violently agitated.  Sympathy with the miserable  victim and anticipations of similar deceptions for themselves, their  sisters, and their daughters, made them now regard the Colour Bill in  an entirely new aspect.  Not a few openly avowed themselves converted  to antagonism; the rest needed only a slight stimulus to make a similar  avowal.  Seizing this favourable opportunity, the Circles hastily  convened an extraordinary Assembly of the States; and besides the usual  guard of Convicts, they secured the attendance of a large number of  reactionary Women.    Amidst an unprecedented concourse, the Chief Circle of those days--by  name Pantocyclus--arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a hundred  and twenty thousand Isosceles.  But he secured silence by declaring  that henceforth the Circles would enter on a policy of Concession;  yielding to the wishes of the majority, they would accept the Colour  Bill.  The uproar being at once converted to applause, he invited  Chromatistes, the leader of the Sedition, into the centre of the hall,  to receive in the name of his followers the submission of the  Hierarchy.  Then followed a speech, a masterpiece of rhetoric, which  occupied nearly a day in the delivery, and to which no summary can do  justice.    With a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they were  now finally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation, it was  desirable that they should take one last view of the perimeter of the  whole subject, its defects as well as its advantages.  Gradually  introducing the mention of the dangers to the Tradesmen, the  Professional Classes and the Gentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs  of the Isosceles by reminding them that, in spite of all these defects,  he was willing to accept the Bill if it was approved by the majority.  But it was manifest that all, except the Isosceles, were moved by his  words and were either neutral or averse to the Bill.    Turning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must not be  neglected, and that, if they intended to accept the Colour Bill, they  ought at least to do so with full view of the consequences.  Many of  them, he said, were on the point of being admitted to the class of the  Regular Triangles; others anticipated for their children a distinction  they could not hope for themselves.  That honourable ambition would now  have to be sacrificed.  With the universal adoption of Colour, all  distinctions would cease; Regularity would be confused with  Irregularity; development would give place to retrogression; the  Workman would in a few generations be degraded to the level of the  Military, or even the Convict Class; political power would be in the  hands of the greatest number, that is to say the Criminal Classes, who  were already more numerous than the Workmen, and would soon out-number  all the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws of  Nature were violated.    A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans, and  Chromatistes, in alarm, attempted"]]]
