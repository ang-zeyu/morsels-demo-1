It  is true that there were occasions when, as the correspondence reveals,  the Queen was disposed to think that King Leopold endeavoured to  exercise too minute a control over her in matters of detail, and even  to attempt to modify the foreign policy of England rather for the  benefit of Belgium than in the best interests of Great Britain; but  the Queen was equal to these emergencies; she expressed her dissent  from the King's suggestions in considerate and affectionate terms,  with her gratitude for his advice, but made no pretence of following  it.    For her aunt, Queen Adelaide, the Princess Victoria had always felt  a strong affection; and though it can hardly be said that this gentle  and benevolent lady exercised any great influence over her more  vigorous and impetuous niece, yet the letters will testify to the  closeness of the tie which united them.      [Pageheading: QUEEN ADELAIDE]    Queen Adelaide was the eldest child of George, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen;  her mother was a princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.    At the age of twenty-six she was married to the Duke of Clarence, then  in his fifty-third year, without any preliminary courtship. They  lived for a year in Hanover, and then principally at Bushey Park. Two  daughters were born to them, the elder of whom lived only a few hours;  the younger, Princess Elizabeth, died in the first year of her age.  Their married life was a happy one, in spite of the disparity of  age. Queen Adelaide was a woman of a deeply affectionate disposition,  sensible, sympathetic, and religious. She had a very definite ideal of  the duties of a wife and a Queen; she made it her pleasure to meet and  anticipate, as far as possible, her husband's wishes; and her husband,  hasty and choleric though he was, repaid her with tender affection. To  such an extent did the Queen merge her views in those of her husband,  that she passed at one time through a period of general unpopularity.  It was believed that she was adverse to Reform, and used her influence  against it. She was mobbed in the streets at the time when the Reform  agitation was at its height; and it is said that when the Melbourne  Ministry of 1834 was dismissed, London was (owing to an unjustifiable  communication of Lord Brougham to the _Times_) placarded with posters  bearing the words, \"The Queen has done it all!\"    It is a pathetic instance of the irony of fate that Queen Adelaide  should have thus been supposed to desire to take an active part in  politics. It is obvious, from her letters, that she had practically  no political views at all, except a gentle distrust of all proposed  changes, social or political. Her one idea of her position as Queen  was to agree with any expression of opinion that fell from the King.  She was fond of music, and took a deep interest in her religious  duties and in all that concerned the welfare of the Protestant  communion. But apart from this, her interests were entirely domestic  and personal, and her letters reveal her character in the most  amiable light. Her devotion to the King, and the tender and respectful  diffidence with which she welcomed her niece to the Throne, show a  very sweet nature.    The rest of her life, after King William's death, was passed to a  great extent under invalid conditions, though she was only forty-four  at the time of her niece's accession. She travelled a good deal in  search of health, and lived a quiet life in England, surrounded by  a small but devoted circle of friends and relations. Her personal  popularity with the nation became very great, not only for the simple  kindliness of her life, but for her splendid munificence; it is said  that her public subscriptions often exceeded L20,000 a year. She died  in December 1849. Queen Victoria was very much attached to her gentle,  simple-minded, and tender-hearted aunt, and treated her with the  utmost consideration and an almost daughterly affection.      [Pageheading: BARONESS LEHZEN]    Another person who had a large share in forming the Queen's character  was Louise Lehzen, the daughter of a Hanoverian clergyman, who came  to England as governess to Princess Feodore of Leiningen, Queen  Victoria's half-sister, shortly before the Queen's birth. In 1824  she became governess to the Princess Victoria. In 1827 George IV.  conferred upon her the rank of a Hanoverian Baroness. When the Duchess  of Northumberland, in 1830, was appointed the Princess's official  governess, she remained as lady in attendance. The Princess was  devoted to her, but \"greatly in awe of her.\" She remained at Court  after the accession till 1842, without holding an official position,  and then returned to Germany, where she died in 1870.      [Pageheading: BARON STOCKMAR]    Baron Stockmar was another of the interesting personalities who came  into very close contact with the Queen in her early years. He was  forty-nine at the time of the accession, but he had come to England  more than twenty years before as private physician to Prince Leopold.  He endeared himself to the Princess Charlotte, who died holding his  hand. He afterwards became Prince Leopold's private secretary, and  took a prominent part as the Prince's representative in the successive  negotiations with regard to his candidature for the thrones of Greece  and Belgium. Upon the accession of Queen Victoria, Stockmar joined  the Court in a private capacity, and for fifteen months he held an  unofficial position as her chief adviser. There was a general feeling  of dislike in the minds of the English public to the German influences  that were supposed to be brought to bear on the Queen; and Lord  Melbourne found it necessary to make a public and categorical denial  of the statement that Stockmar was acting as the Queen's private  secretary. But the statement, if not technically, was virtually  true. Stockmar lived at Court, had interviews with the Queen and her  Ministers, and though he industriously endeavoured to efface himself,  yet there is no doubt that he was consulted on most important  questions. In 1838, he had been entrusted by King Leopold, with the  Queen's knowledge and consent, with a mission of great delicacy: he  was asked to accompany Prince Albert on a tour in Italy, with the idea  of completing his education, and in order to satisfy himself that  the Prince would be a worthy Consort for the Queen. This task he  discharged admirably, and became the most confidential and trusted of  all the Prince's friends. There are many letters of Stockmar's to the  Prince extant, which prove that Stockmar never shrank from speaking  the plainest truth to the Prince on matters of duty and faults of  temperament, without any courtier-like attempt to blink criticism  that might have been unpalatable. The Prince had the generosity and  humility to value this trait of Stockmar's very highly, to such an  extent that Stockmar's influence possessed if anything too great a  preponderance. Stockmar had jealously nursed two profound political  ideals--the unity of Germany under Prussia, and the establishment of  close relations between Germany and England. He induced Prince Albert,  heavily burdened as he was with work, to devote almost too much time  and thought to the former of these aims. Stockmar was a profound  student of social and constitutional questions. He had made a close  study of English political institutions; but though he grasped the  constitutional theory of the English Throne, and saw that the first  necessity for the Sovereign was to hold a position independent of  party, he never clearly understood that the Monarch should keep as  far as possible clear of political details. Stockmar's view of the  position was that the Sovereign should be practically Premier as well;  and much of the jealousy that was felt, on various occasions, at  the position which Prince Albert assumed with regard to political  situations, is referable to Stockmar's influence.    He was a very able man, with immense political knowledge, and without  personal ambition; Lord Palmerston, who was no friend to Stockmar's  theory of government, admitted that he was the most disinterested man  he had ever encountered. Stockmar's ambition was to achieve his  own political ideals, and to modify the course of events in what he  conceived to be beneficial directions; he was entirely indifferent  to the trappings of power, and this very disinterestedness made his  influence more supreme.    He suffered all his life from feeble health and a hypochondriacal  tendency, and was genuinely fond of retirement and quiet life. He  certainly deserved the devoted confidence reposed in him by Prince  Albert and the Queen; it may perhaps be questioned whether his own  _doctrinaire_ bias did not make itself too strongly felt, in the  minuteness with which Prince Albert dealt with English politics; but  the net result of his influence was that the danger, which lies in  wait for strictly constitutional Sovereigns, was averted--the danger,  that is, of leaving the administration of State affairs in the hands  of specialists, and depriving it of the wise control and independent  criticism which only the Crown can adequately supply.          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    TO CHAPTER IV      Queen Victoria, from the very first, took great pleasure in filing  the correspondence addressed to her. There are many volumes of letters  received from her various relations. We have thought it best to give  some of Queen Adelaide's early letters; they indicate in a remarkable  manner the growing estrangement between King William IV. and the  Duchess of Kent. In the earlier letters the King enquires very  affectionately after the Duchess, and constant mention is made of  presents sent to her; but the references made to her become less  frequent and colder, till at last the King contents himself with  sending"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20031"],[0,"A Final Reckoning: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia (#9)"],[1,"of what had  been said. It was, he judged, a quarter of an hour before the  conversation ceased. They did not return to him but remained at  some distance off, and Reuben thought that he heard the footsteps  of one of them going down the lane. He could feel, by a warm  sensation across his cheek, that the blood was flowing freely from  the wound he had received on his temple. A dull torpid feeling came  over him, and after a time he again lost consciousness.    How long he remained in this state he did not know, but he was at  last aroused by being lifted and thrown into the bottom of the  cart. Four men then climbed up into it and the horse was started.  They drove at a quick pace, and Reuben wondered why they were  taking him away with them. His head ached terribly, and he suffered  much from the tightness of the cords which bound his arms. The men  seemed in high good humour, and talked and laughed in low tones;  but the noise of the vehicle prevented Reuben hearing what was  said.    It was, as far as he could judge, full two hours before the vehicle  stopped. He was roughly taken out of the cart, his arms were  unbound; and the men, leaping up, drove away at full speed. The  spot where he had been left was very dark, for trees overshadowed  it on both sides. Where he was he had no idea, but he judged that  he must be fully twenty miles from the village.    His first impulse was to take the handkerchief from his mouth, and  he then walked slowly along the road, in the direction from which  he had come. It was, he felt sure, no use shouting; for they would  have been certain to have selected some lonely spot to set him  down, and there would be no chance of awakening the inhabitants of  any distant cottage. He walked slowly, for he was faint with loss  of blood.    After proceeding about a quarter of a mile, he emerged from the  wood and came upon a spot where the road forked. Having no clue  whatever as to the direction in which Lewes lay, he sat down upon a  heap of stones and waited patiently for morning. He had no doubt  that the burglary had been a successful one, and he bitterly  regretted his neglect to keep a watch down the lane, to see that he  was not surprised by the men he had heard were coming. At any rate,  he hoped that he should be able to give such information as would  set the constables upon the track.    It seemed to him that some three hours passed before a faint light  began to dawn in the sky. By this he knew that it must be about  half-past six, and calculated, therefore, he must have set out in  the trap about half-past one. He now started to walk along the  road, hoping that he should soon meet some labourer going to work.  Stopping by a small stream which ran across the road, he washed his  head and face; as he had lain on the ground after being struck, the  blood had not flowed on to his clothes.    After the wash he proceeded with a brisker step. Half an hour later  he met a ploughman, riding one of his team to the fields.    \"Is this the road to Lewes?\" Reuben asked.    \"Lewes? Noa, this baint the road to Lewes. I don't know nothing  about the road to Lewes. This bee the road to Hastings, if you goes  further. So they tell me; I ain't never been there.\"    \"Is there a village anywhere about here?\" Reuben asked.    \"Ay, half a mile or so on.\"    Reuben walked on till he got to the village; and then, going to a  public house, obtained some refreshment and learned, from the  landlord, the direction he should take to get to the main road  leading to Lewes; which was, as he expected, some twenty miles  away. He found that the cart had not followed the main road towards  London, but had driven by crossroads for a considerable distance,  before turning north.    It was late in the afternoon before Reuben arrived at Lewes, for he  had been obliged to rest often by the way, and had made but slow  progress. When within a few doors of his mother's house, one of the  constables of the town came up to him and touched him on the  shoulder.    \"I arrest you in the king's name!\"    \"Arrest me! What for?\" Reuben exclaimed.    \"For breaking into the house of Squire Ellison, of Tipping, that's  what it's for.\"    Reuben laughed.    \"You have got the wrong man this time. I have no more to do with  the burglary than a child.\"    \"It's no laughing matter,\" the constable said. \"If you are innocent  you have got to prove it; that ain't no business of mine. All I  have got to do is to arrest you.\"    So saying, and before Reuben knew what he was about, he slipped a  pair of handcuffs over his wrists. Reuben flushed up. Hitherto he  had scarcely taken the matter seriously, but to be marched  handcuffed through the streets of Lewes was an indignity which  enraged him.    \"Take these off,\" he said angrily. \"I will go quietly with you.\"    \"You may or you may not,\" the man said doggedly. \"You are younger  than I am, and maybe can run faster. I ain't agoing to chance it.\"    Reuben saw that it was of no use to argue and, silent and pale, he  walked along by the side of the constable, who retained a tight  hold of his collar. A little crowd gathered speedily round, for  such a sight was unusual in Lewes; and Reuben felt thankful when  they reached the cells, and he was sheltered from the gaze of the  public. A minute later the head constable came in.    \"Now, my lad, don't say anything to criminate yourself,\" he began;  \"the less you talk, the better for you. I am sorry to see you here,  for I knew your father, and I have a good character of you from  your employer; so I give you my advice--keep your mouth shut.\"    \"But I am not going to keep my mouth shut,\" Reuben said  indignantly. \"Here am I, arrested in the public streets, marched  handcuffed through the town upon a most monstrous charge, which has  been brought against me without a shadow of evidence.\"    \"Don't be talking, don't be talking,\" the constable said testily;  \"you will hear the evidence in time enough.\"    \"But I will talk. I want to tell you what's happened, and you will  see that I am innocent, at once.\"    \"Very well, if you will you will; but mind, don't blame me  afterwards.\"    Reuben told the story of his adventures from the time of leaving.    \"There,\" he said when he finished, \"isn't that enough to show that  I am innocent?\"    \"No,\" the chief constable said gravely, \"it's not enough to prove  anything, one way or the other. I am bound to say the story looks a  likely one; and if it weren't for two or three matters which I  heard of, from the constable who came over from Tipping, I should  have no doubt about it. However, all that is for the magistrate to  decide. There will be a meeting tomorrow.\"    \"But can't I be taken before a magistrate at once? There's Captain  Fidler, within a mile.\"    \"What would be the good?\" the chief constable said. \"You don't  suppose anyone would let you out, only on the strength of the story  you have told me. He could only remand you, and you could gain  nothing by it.\"    \"Can I see my mother?\" Reuben asked next.    \"Yes,\" the constable said, \"I will send her down a message, at  once.\"    Mrs. Whitney soon came up. A neighbour had brought her in the news  when Reuben had been arrested, and she was on the point of starting  to inquire about it when the message arrived. She was more  indignant than grieved, when she heard the charge which had been  brought against Reuben.    \"The idea of such a thing!\" she exclaimed. \"These constables don't  seem to have natural sense. The idea of charging anyone who is  known as a respectable young man with such a thing as that, and  shutting him up without a question. Why, there can't be any  evidence against you.\"    \"There's no saying, mother,\" Reuben replied. \"You mustn't be too  sure of that. Don't you remember that affair of the dog? Well, the  same hand is at work now. Before, I only suspected who had done it;  but I am sure now. However, whatever evidence they may have got, we  know it isn't true. I have four years' good character here to speak  for me. Still, it is hard that I should get into positions of this  sort, without any fault of mine.\"    \"It's better that it is without any fault of yours, Reuben.\"    \"That is right enough, mother, so we will both keep up our  spirits.\"        Chapter 4: The Trial.      There were three magistrates on the bench on the following morning,  when Reuben was brought up. The justice room was crowded, for the  series of burglaries had caused some excitement; and the news that  the house of Mr. Ellison had been broken into, and that one of the  men who had been taken turned out to belong to Lewes, had created  quite a sensation.    Mr. Ellison was the first to give his evidence. He testified that,  on waking on the previous morning, he found that someone had been  in his room during the night. He was not in the habit of locking  his door, and had not been awakened. He found that a box which  stood on the dressing table, containing some valuable jewelry, was  gone; that his watch and that of Mrs. Ellison had been taken; that  the drawers had been opened, and a case containing the more  valuable jewels of his wife had also been abstracted. This was not  discovered till afterwards. He first missed his watch.    He rang the servants up, for it was still early; and it was then  discovered that the lower premises had been broken into, the plate  chest in the butler's pantry broken open, and a large quantity of  plate stolen.    \"What do you estimate the value of the articles stolen, Mr.  Ellison?\"    \"The value of my wife's jewels I should put down, roughly, at two  thousand pounds; the silver plate might have been worth three  hundred more; the watches and other articles, so far as I yet miss  them, say another hundred.\"    The servants proved that they found the kitchen window open, on  going downstairs. It had been opened by the catch being forced  back. It was not the custom to put up shutters. The pantry door,"]]]
