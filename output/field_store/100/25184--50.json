When she recovered  consciousness, she was lying on the tiles, and all around was still  and normal. She got up, found and lighted her candle, and spent the  rest of the evening, without further adventure, in the drawing-room.    All the week Lady Adela struggled hard to master a disinclination to  spend another evening alone in the house, and when Friday came she  succumbed to her fears. The servants were poor, foolish things, but it  was nice to feel that there was something in the house besides ghosts.  She sat reading in the drawing-room till late that night, and when she  lolled out of the window to take a farewell look at the sky and stars  before retiring to rest, the sounds of traffic had completely ceased  and the whole city lay bathed in a refreshing silence. It was very  heavenly to stand there and feel the cool, soft air--unaccompanied,  for the first time during the day, by the rattling rumbling sounds of  locomotion and the jarring discordant murmurs of unmusical  voices--fanning her neck and face.    Lady Adela, used as she was to the privacy of her yacht, and the  freedom of her big country mansion, where all sounds were regulated at  her will, chafed at the near proximity of her present habitation to  the noisy thoroughfare, and vaguely looked forward to the hours when  shops and theatres were closed, and all screeching, harsh-voiced  products of the gutter were in bed. To her the nights in Waterloo  Place were all too short; the days too long, too long for anything.  The heavy, lumbering steps of a policeman at last broke her reverie.  She had no desire to arouse his curiosity; besides, her costume had  become somewhat disordered, and she had the strictest sense of  propriety, at least in the presence of the lower orders. Retiring,  therefore, with a sigh of vexation, she sought her bedroom, and, after  the most scrupulous attention to her toilet, put out the lights and  got into bed. It was just one when she fell asleep, and three when she  awoke with a violent start. Why she started puzzled her. She did not  recollect experiencing any very dreadful dream, in fact no dream at  all, and there seemed nothing in the hush--the apparently unbroken  hush--that could in any way account for her action. Why, then, had she  started? She lay still and wondered. Surely everything was just as it  was when she went to sleep! And yet! When she ventured on a diagnosis,  there was something different, something new; she did not think it was  actually in the atmosphere, nor in the silence; she did not know where  it was until she opened her eyes--and then she _knew_. Bending over  her, within a few inches of her face, was another face, the ghastly  caricature of a human face. It was on a larger scale than that of any  mortal Lady Adela had ever seen; it was long in proportion to its  width--indeed, she could not make out where the cranium terminated at  the back, as the hinder portion of it was lost in a mist. The  forehead, which was very receding, was partly covered with a mass of  lank, black hair, that fell straight down into space; there were no  neck nor shoulders, at least none had materialised; the skin was  leaden-hued, and the emaciation so extreme that the raw cheek-bones  had burst through in places; the size of the eye sockets which  appeared monstrous, was emphasised by the fact that the eyes were  considerably sunken; the lips were curled downwards and tightly shut,  and the whole expression of the withered mouth, as indeed that of the  entire face, was one of bestial, diabolical malignity. Lady Adela's  heart momentarily stopped, her blood ran cold, she was petrified; and  as she stared helplessly at the dark eyes pressed close to hers, she  saw them suddenly suffuse with fiendish glee. The most frightful  change then took place: the upper lip writhed away from a few greenish  yellow stumps; the lower jaw fell with a metallic click, leaving the  mouth widely open, and disclosing to Lady Adela's shocked vision a  black and bloated tongue; the eyeballs rolled up and entirely  disappeared, whilst their places were immediately filled with the  foulest and most loathsome indications of advanced decay. A strong,  vibratory movement suddenly made all the bones in the head rattle and  the tongue wag, whilst from the jaws, as if belched up from some  deep-down well, came a gust of wind, putrescent with the ravages of  the tomb, and yet, at the same time, tainted with the same sweet,  sickly odour with which Lady Adela had latterly become so familiar.  This was the culminating act; the head then receded, and, growing  fainter and fainter, gradually disappeared altogether. Lady Adela was  now more than satisfied,--there was not a house more horribly haunted  in Scotland,--and nothing on earth would induce her to remain in it  another night.    However, being anxious, naturally, to discover something that might,  in some degree, account for the apparitions, Lady Adela made endless  inquiries concerning the history of former occupants of the house;  but, failing to find out anything remarkable in this direction, she  was eventually obliged to content herself with the following  tradition: It was said that on the site of No. -- Forrest Road there  had once stood a cottage occupied by two sisters (both nurses), and  that one was suspected of poisoning the other; and that the cottage,  moreover, having through their parsimonious habits got into a very bad  state of repair, was blown down during a violent storm, the surviving  sister perishing in the ruins. Granted that this story is correct, it  was in all probability the ghost of this latter sister that appeared  to Lady Adela. Her ladyship is, of course, anxious to let No.  -- Forrest Road, and as only about one in a thousand people seem to  possess the faculty of seeing psychic phenomena, she hopes she may one  day succeed in getting a permanent tenant. In the meanwhile, she is  doing her level best to suppress the rumour that the house is  haunted.                                   CASE VI        THE PHANTOM REGIMENT OF KILLIECRANKIE      Many are the stories that have from time to time been circulated with  regard to the haunting of the Pass of Killiecrankie by phantom  soldiers, but I do not think there is any stranger story than that  related to me, some years ago, by a lady who declared she had actually  witnessed the phenomena. Her account of it I shall reproduce as far as  possible in her own words:--           *       *       *       *       *    Let me commence by stating that I am not a spiritualist, and that I  have the greatest possible aversion to convoking the earthbound souls  of the dead. Neither do I lay any claim to mediumistic powers (indeed  I have always regarded the term \"medium\" with the gravest suspicion).  I am, on the contrary, a plain, practical, matter-of-fact woman, and  with the exception of this one occasion, never witnessed any psychic  phenomena.    The incident I am about to relate took place the autumn before last. I  was on a cycle tour in Scotland, and, making Pitlochry my temporary  headquarters, rode over one evening to view the historic Pass of  Killiecrankie. It was late when I arrived there, and the western sky  was one great splash of crimson and gold--such vivid colouring I had  never seen before and never have seen since. Indeed, I was so  entranced at the sublimity of the spectacle, that I perched myself on  a rock at the foot of one of the great cliffs that form the walls of  the Pass, and, throwing my head back, imagined myself in fairyland.  Lost, thus, in a delicious luxury, I paid no heed to the time, nor did  I think of stirring, until the dark shadows of the night fell across  my face. I then started up in a panic, and was about to pedal off in  hot haste, when a strange notion suddenly seized me: I had a latchkey,  plenty of sandwiches, a warm cape, why should I not camp out there  till early morning--I had long yearned to spend a night in the open,  now was my opportunity. The idea was no sooner conceived than put  into operation. Selecting the most comfortable-looking boulder I could  see, I scrambled on to the top of it, and, with my cloak drawn tightly  over my back and shoulders, commenced my vigil. The cold mountain air,  sweet with the perfume of gorse and heather, intoxicated me, and I  gradually sank into a heavenly torpor, from which I was abruptly  aroused by a dull boom, that I at once associated with distant  musketry. All was then still, still as the grave, and, on glancing at  the watch I wore strapped on my wrist, I saw it was two o'clock. A  species of nervous dread now laid hold of me, and a thousand and one  vague fancies, all the more distressing because of their vagueness,  oppressed and disconcerted me. Moreover, I was impressed for the first  time with the extraordinary solitude--solitude that seemed to belong  to a period far other than the present, and, as I glanced around at  the solitary pines and gleaming boulders, I more than half expected to  see the wild, ferocious face of some robber chief--some fierce yet  fascinating hero of Sir Walter Scott's--peering at me from behind  them. This feeling at length became so acute, that, in a panic of  fear--ridiculous, puerile fear, I forcibly withdrew my gaze and  concentrated it abstractedly on the ground at my feet. I then  listened, and in the rustling of a leaf, the humming of some night  insect, the whizzing of a bat, the whispering of the wind as it moaned  softly past me, I fancied--nay, I felt sure I detected something that  was not ordinary. I blew my nose, and had barely ceased marvelling at  the loudness of its reverberations, before the piercing, ghoulish  shriek of an owl sent the blood in torrents to my heart. I then  laughed, and my blood froze as I heard a chorus, of what I tried to  persuade myself could only be echoes, proceed from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],[0,"Piccadilly Jim (#9)"],[1,"was profoundly thankful that she had  mistaken him for the butler. A chill passed through him as he  pictured what would have been Eugenia's reception of the  information that he had committed such a bourgeois solecism as  opening the front door to Mrs. Pett of all people, who already  despised him as a low vulgarian. There had been trouble enough  when she had found him opening it a few weeks before to a mere  collector of subscriptions for a charity. He perceived, with a  clarity remarkable in view of the fact that the discovery of her  identity had given him a feeling of physical dizziness, that at  all costs he must foster this misapprehension on his  sister-in-law's part.    Fortunately he was in a position to do so. He knew all about what  butlers did and what they said on these occasions, for in his  innocently curious way he had often pumped Bayliss on the subject.  He bowed silently and led the way to the morning-room, followed  by the drove of Petts: then, opening the door, stood aside to  allow the procession to march past the given point.    \"I will inform Mrs. Crocker that you are here, madam.\"    Mrs. Pett, shepherding the chewing child before her, passed into  the room. In the light of her outspoken sentiments regarding her  brother-in-law, it is curious to reflect that his manner at this,  their first meeting, had deeply impressed her. After many months  of smouldering revolt she had dismissed her own butler a day or  so before sailing for England, and for the first time envy of her  sister Eugenia gripped her. She did not covet Eugenia's other  worldly possessions, but she did grudge her this supreme butler.    Mr. Pett, meanwhile, had been trailing in the rear with a hunted  expression on his face. He wore the unmistakable look of a man  about to be present at a row between women, and only a wet cat in  a strange back-yard bears itself with less jauntiness than a man  faced by such a prospect. A millionaire several times over, Mr.  Pett would cheerfully have given much of his wealth to have been  elsewhere at that moment. Such was the agitated state of his mind  that, when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm as he was about  to follow his wife into the room, he started so violently that  his hat flew out of his hand. He turned to meet the eyes of the  butler who had admitted him to the house, fixed on his in an  appealing stare.    \"Who's leading in the pennant race?\" said this strange butler in  a feverish whisper.    It was a question, coming from such a source, which in another  than Mr. Pett might well have provoked a blank stare of  amazement. Such, however, is the almost superhuman intelligence  and quickness of mind engendered by the study of America's  national game that he answered without the slightest hesitation.    \"Giants!\"    \"Wow!\" said the butler.    No sense of anything strange or untoward about the situation came  to mar the perfect joy of Mr. Pett, the overmastering joy of the  baseball fan who in a strange land unexpectedly encounters a  brother. He thrilled with a happiness which he had never hoped  to feel that morning.    \"No signs of them slumping?\" enquired the butler.    \"No. But you never can tell. It's early yet. I've seen those boys  lead the league till the end of August and then be nosed out.\"    \"True enough,\" said the butler sadly.    \"Matty's in shape.\"    \"He is? The old souper working well?\"    \"Like a machine. He shut out the Cubs the day before I sailed!\"    \"Fine!\"    At this point an appreciation of the unusualness of the  proceedings began to steal upon Mr. Pett. He gaped at this  surprising servitor.    \"How on earth do you know anything about baseball?\" he demanded.    The other seemed to stiffen. A change came over his whole  appearance. He had the air of an actor who has remembered his  part.    \"I beg your pardon, sir. I trust I have not taken a liberty. I was  at one time in the employment of a gentleman in New York, and  during my stay I became extremely interested in the national  game. I picked up a few of the American idioms while in the  country.\" He smiled apologetically. \"They sometimes slip out.\"    \"Let 'em slip!\" said Mr. Pett with enthusiasm. \"You're the first  thing that's reminded me of home since I left. Say!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Got a good place here?\"    \"Er--oh, yes, sir.\"    \"Well, here's my card. If you ever feel like making a change,  there's a job waiting for you at that address.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\" Mr. Crocker stooped.    \"Your hat, sir.\"    He held it out, gazing fondly at it the while. It was like being  home again to see a hat like that. He followed Mr. Pett as he  went into the morning-room with an affectionate eye.    Bayliss was coming along the hall, hurrying more than his wont.  The ring at the front door had found him deep in an extremely  interesting piece of news in his halfpenny morning paper, and he  was guiltily aware of having delayed in answering it.    \"Bayliss,\" said Mr. Crocker in a cautious undertone, \"go and tell  Mrs. Crocker that Mrs. Pett is waiting to see her. She's in the  morning-room. If you're asked, say you let her in. Get me?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Bayliss, grateful for this happy solution.    \"Oh, Bayliss!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Is the wicket at Lord's likely to be too sticky for them to go  on with that game to-day?\"    \"I hardly think it probable that there will be play, sir. There  was a great deal of rain in the night.\"    Mr. Crocker passed on to his den with a lighter heart.                *       *       *       *       *    It was Mrs. Crocker's habit, acquired after years of practice and  a sedulous study of the best models, to conceal beneath a mask of  well-bred indifference any emotion which she might chance to  feel. Her dealings with the aristocracy of England had shown her  that, while the men occasionally permitted themselves an  outburst, the women never did, and she had schooled herself so  rigorously that nowadays she seldom even raised her voice. Her  bearing, as she approached the morning-room was calm and serene,  but inwardly curiosity consumed her. It was unbelievable that  Nesta could have come to try to effect a reconciliation, yet she  could think of no other reason for her visit.    She was surprised to find three persons in the morning-room.  Bayliss, delivering his message, had mentioned only Mrs. Pett. To  Mrs. Crocker the assemblage had the appearance of being a sort of  Old Home Week of Petts, a kind of Pett family mob-scene. Her  sister's second marriage having taken place after their quarrel,  she had never seen her new brother-in-law, but she assumed that  the little man lurking in the background was Mr. Pett. The guess  was confirmed.    \"Good morning, Eugenia,\" said Mrs. Pett.    \"Peter, this is my sister, Eugenia. My husband.\"    Mrs. Crocker bowed stiffly. She was thinking how hopelessly  American Mr. Pett was, how baggy his clothes looked, what  absurdly shaped shoes he wore, how appalling his hat was, how  little hair he had and how deplorably he lacked all those graces  of repose, culture, physical beauty, refinement, dignity, and  mental alertness which raise men above the level of the common  cock-roach.    Mr. Pett, on his side, receiving her cold glance squarely between  the eyes, felt as if he were being disembowelled by a clumsy  amateur. He could not help wondering what sort of a man this  fellow Crocker was whom this sister-in-law of his had married. He  pictured him as a handsome, powerful, robust individual with a  strong jaw and a loud voice, for he could imagine no lesser type  of man consenting to link his lot with such a woman. He sidled in  a circuitous manner towards a distant chair, and, having lowered  himself into it, kept perfectly still, pretending to be dead,  like an opossum. He wished to take no part whatever in the coming  interview.    \"Ogden, of course, you know,\" said Mrs. Pett.    She was sitting so stiffly upright on a hard chair and had so  much the appearance of having been hewn from the living rock that  every time she opened her mouth it was as if a statue had spoken.    \"I know Ogden,\" said Mrs. Crocker shortly. \"Will you please stop  him fidgeting with that vase? It is valuable.\"    She directed at little Ogden, who was juggling aimlessly with a  handsome _objet d'art_ of the early Chinese school, a glance similar  to that which had just disposed of his step-father. But Ogden  required more than a glance to divert him from any pursuit in which  he was interested. He shifted a deposit of candy from his right  cheek to his left cheek, inspected Mrs. Crocker for a moment with a  pale eye, and resumed his juggling. Mrs. Crocker meant nothing in  his young life.    \"Ogden, come and sit down,\" said Mrs. Pett.    \"Don't want to sit down.\"    \"Are you making a long stay in England, Nesta?\" asked Mrs.  Crocker coldly.    \"I don't know. We have made no plans.\"    \"Indeed?\"    She broke off. Ogden, who had possessed himself of a bronze  paper-knife, had begun to tap the vase with it. The ringing note  thus produced appeared to please his young mind.    \"If Ogden really wishes to break that vase,\" said Mrs. Crocker in  a detached voice, \"let me ring for the butler to bring him a  hammer.\"    \"Ogden!\" said Mrs. Pett.    \"Oh Gee! A fellow can't do a thing!\" muttered Ogden, and walked  to the window. He stood looking out into the square, a slight  twitching of the ears indicating that he still made progress with  the candy.    \"Still the same engaging child!\" murmured Mrs. Crocker.    \"I did not come here to discuss Ogden!\" said Mrs. Pett.    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows. Not even Mrs. Otho Lanners,  from whom she had learned the art, could do it more effectively.    \"I am still waiting to find out why you did come, Nesta!\"    \"I came here to talk to you about your step-son, James Crocker.\"    The discipline to which Mrs. Crocker had subjected herself in the  matter of the display of emotion saved her from the humiliation  of showing"]]]
