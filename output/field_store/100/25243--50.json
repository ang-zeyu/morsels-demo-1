(#9)"],[1,"the spirit of  commerce, had rendered the Government of Holland the most tolerant in  Europe; and thither Robinson and his friends fled from their persecuting  pursuers in 1608, and finally settled at Leyden. Being Independents,  they did not form a connection with any of the Protestant Churches of  the country. Burke remarks that \"In Holland, though a country of the  greatest religious freedom in the world, they did not find themselves  better satisfied than they had been in England. There they were  tolerated, indeed, but watched; their zeal began to have dangerous  languors for want of opposition; and being without power or consequence,  they grew tired of the indolent security of their sanctuary; they chose  to remove to a place where they should see no superior, and therefore  they sent an agent to England, who agreed with the Council of Plymouth  for a tract of land in America, within their jurisdiction, to settle in,  and obtained from the King (James) permission to do so.\"[2]    During their twelve years' _pilgrimage_ in Holland they were good  citizens; not an accusation was brought against any one of them in the  courts; they were honourable and industrious, and took to new trades for  subsistence. Brewster, a man of property, and a gentleman in England,  learned to be a printer at the age of forty-five. Bradford, who had been  a farmer in England, became a silk-dyer. Robinson became noted as a  preacher and controversialist against Arminianism.    Bradford, the historian of their colony and its Governor for eleven  years, gives the chief reasons for their dispute in Holland and of their  desire to remove to America.[3]    As to what particular place these Pilgrims should select for settlement  in America, some were for Guiana, some for Virginia; but they at length  obtained a patent from the second or Northern Virginia Company for a  settlement on the northern part of their territory, which extended to  the fortieth degree of North latitude--Hutchinson Bay. \"The Dutch  laboured to persuade them to go to the Hudson river, and settle under  the West India Company; but they had not lost their affection for the  English, and chose to be under their government and protection.\"[4]  Bancroft, after quoting the statement that \"upon their talking of  removing, sundry of the Dutch would have them go under them, and made  them large offers,\" remarks: \"But the Pilgrims were attached to their  nationality as Englishmen, and to the language of their times. A secret  but deeply-seated love of their country led them to the generous purpose  of recovering the protection of England by enlarging her dominions. They  were restless with the desire to live once more under the government of  their native land.\"[5] It appears from Bradford's History, as well as  from his Letter Book, and other narratives, that there were serious  disputes and recriminations among the Pilgrim exiles and their friends  in England, before matters could be arranged for their departure. But  only \"the minor part [of Robinson's congregation], with Mr. Brewster,  their elder, resolved to enter upon this great work.\" They embarked at  Delft Haven, a seaport town on the River Maeser, eight miles from Delft,  fourteen miles from Leyden, and thirty-six miles from Amsterdam. The  last port from which they sailed in England was Southampton; and after a  tempestuous passage of 65 days, in the _Mayflower_, of 181 tons, with  101 passengers, they spied land, which proved to be Cape Cod--about 150  miles north of their intended place of destination. The pilot of the  vessel had been there before and recognised the land as Cape Cod; \"the  which,\" says Bradford, \"being made and certainly known to be it, they  were not a little joyful.\"[6] But though the Pilgrims were \"not a  little joyful\" at safely reaching the American coast, and at a place so  well known as Cape Cod; yet as that was not their intended place of  settlement, they, without landing, put again to sea for Hudson river  (New York), but were driven back by stress of weather, and, on account  of the lateness of the season, determined not to venture out to sea  again, but to seek a place of settlement within the harbour.    As the Pilgrims landed north of the limits of the Company from which  they received their patent, and under which they expected to become a  \"body politic,\" it became to them \"void and useless.\" This being known,  some of the emigrants on board the _Mayflower_ began to make \"mutinous  speeches,\" saying that \"when they came ashore they would use their own  liberty, for none had power to command them.\" Under these circumstances  it was thought necessary to \"begin with a combination, which might be as  firm as any patent, and in some respects more so.\" Accordingly, an  agreement was drawn up and signed in the cabin of the _Mayflower_ by  forty-one male passengers, who with their families constituted the whole  colony of one hundred and one.[7] Having thus provided against disorder  and faction, the Pilgrims proceeded to land, when, as Bradford says,  they \"fell upon their knees and blessed the God of heaven who had  brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from  all the perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the  firm and stable earth, their proper element.\"[8] Of the manner of their  settlement, their exposures, sufferings, labours, successes, I leave the  many ordinary histories to narrate, though they nearly all revel in the  marvellous.[9]    I will therefore proceed to give a brief account of the Plymouth  government in relation to religious liberty within its limits and  loyalty to the Mother Country.

But this  is all fancy; there is no foundation for it in the statement of Governor  Bradford, who was one of the passengers, and who says that they were  \"not a little joyful\" when they found certainly that the land was Cape  Cod; and afterwards, speaking of their coasting in the neighbourhood,  Bradford says, \"They hasted to a place that their pilot (one Willm.  Coppin, _who had been there before_) did assure them was a good harbour,  which he had been in.\" (History of Plymouth Plantation, p. 86.) They did  not even go ashore on their first entrance into Cape Cod harbour; but,  as Bradford says, \"after some deliberation among themselves and with the  master of the ship, they _tacked about_ and resolved to stand for the  _southward, to find some place about Hudson river for their  habitation_.\" (_Ib._, p. 117.) \"After sailing southward half a day, they  found themselves suddenly among shoals and breakers\" (a ledge of rocks  and shoals which are a terror to navigators to this day); and the wind  shifting against them, they scud back to Cape Cod, and, as Bradford  says, \"thought themselves happy to get out of those dangers before night  overtook them, and the next day they got into the Cape harbour, where  they rode in safety. Being thus arrived in a good harbour, and brought  safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of heaven,\"  &c.    The selection, before leaving England, of the neighbourhood of the  Hudson river as their location, showed a worldly sagacity not to be  exceeded by any emigrants even of the present century. Bancroft  designates it \"the best position on the whole coast.\" (History of the  United States, Vol. I., p. 209.)]    [Footnote 7: The agreement was as follows:--\"In the name of God, Amen.  We whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread  Sovereign Lord, King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain,  France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &c., having undertaken,  for the glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith, and honour  of our King and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the  northern parts of [then called] Virginia, do by these presents, solemnly  and mutually, in the presence of God and of one another, covenant and  combine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better  ordering and preservation, and furthermore of the ends aforesaid; and by  virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame such just laws,  ordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices, from time to time, as  shall be thought most mete and convenient for the general good of the  colony, unto which we promise all due submission and obedience.

This simple and excellent instrument of union and government, suggested  by apprehensions of disorder and anarchy, in the absence of a patent for  common protection, has been magnified by some American writers into an  almost supernatural display of wisdom and foresight, and even the  resurrection of the rights of humanity."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21020"],[0,"The Little Clay Cart (#9)"],[1,"ried-up marshes seeks.           57    [_His voice betraying his passion._] Mistress Vasantasena, we have  reached your home.

I must  go in and find my mistress. [_She walks about and looks around  her._] There is my mistress. She is painting a picture, and putting  her whole heart into it. I must go and speak to her.    [_Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasena, seated, and Madanika._]    _Vasantasena._ Well, girl, and then--    _Madanika._ But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What  do you mean?    _Vasantasena._ Why, what did I say?    _Madanika._ You said, \"and then\"--    _Vasantasena._ [_Puckering her brows._] Oh, yes. So I did.    _Maid._ [_Approaching._] Mistress, your mother sends word that you  should bathe and then offer worship to the gods.    _Vasantasena._ You may tell my mother that I shall not take the  ceremonial bath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place.    _Maid._ Yes, mistress.                                [_Exit._    _Madanika._ My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks  the question--but what does this mean?    _Vasantasena._ Tell me, Madanika. How do I seem to you?    _Madanika._ My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart  is filled with longing for somebody.    _Vasantasena._ Well guessed. My Madanika is quick to fathom  another's heart.    _Madanika._ I am very, very glad. Yes, Kama is indeed mighty, and  his great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress,  is it a king, or a king's favorite, whom you worship?    [28.1. S.    _Vasantasena._ Girl, I wish to love, not to worship.    _Madanika._ Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth  distinguished for very particular learning?    _Vasantasena._ A Brahman I should have to reverence.    _Madanika._ Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously  wealthy from visiting many cities?    _Vasantasena._ A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and  leave you behind, no matter how much you love him. And the  separation makes you very sad.    _Madanika._ It isn't a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a  merchant. Who is it then that the princess loves?    _Vasantasena._ Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where  Kama's temple stands?    _Madanika._ Yes, mistress.    _Vasantasena._ And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger.    _Madanika._ Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when  you asked to be protected?    _Vasantasena._ Well, what was his name?    _Madanika._ Why, he lives in the merchants' quarter.    _Vasantasena._ But I asked you for his name.    _Madanika._ His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name  is Charudatta.    _Vasantasena._ [_Joyfully._] Good, Madanika, good. You have guessed  it.    _Madanika._ [_Aside._] So much for that. [_Aloud._] Mistress, they say  he is poor.    _Vasantasena._ That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan  who sets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of  the world.    P. 59.14]    _Madanika._ But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree  when its blossoms have fallen?    _Vasantasena._ That is just why we call _that_ sort of a girl a butterfly.    _Madanika._ Well, mistress, if you love him, why don't you go and  visit him at once?    _Vasantasena._ Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he  can't make any return--no, I don't mean that, but it would be  hard to see him.    _Madanika._ Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him?    _Vasantasena._ You have guessed it.           *       *       *       *       *    _A voice[40] behind the scenes_.

Despairingly._] What! bound by the gamblers'  ring? Confound it! That is a limit which we gamblers can't pass.  Where can I get the money to pay him?    _Mathura._ Well then, you must give surety.    _Shampooer._ I have an idea.
