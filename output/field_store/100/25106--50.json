Luther, while absent in attendance upon the Missionary  Convention, held in Addison, Vt., obtained through the kindness of the  Rev. Mr. Nott a rare and curious geological specimen from the shores  of Lake Champlain. It is a slab of limestone, about eleven inches long  by six inches wide, which seems to be composed almost entirely of  fossils. There is not half an inch square of the surface which does  not show a fossil. There are many varieties, some of which have not  been identified, but among those which have been are many remains of  the Trinucleus conceniricus, some specimens of Petraia, fragments of  the Orthis, a number of Discinae, several well preserved specimens of  Leptenae, and impressions of Lingula. The latter is the only shell  which has existed from the first dawn of life until the present time  without change. The specimens of existing Lingula are precisely  similar to those found in the earliest geological formations. There  are also in the slab several rare specimens of seaweed, remains of  which are seldom found at so early an age in the geological history of  the world. The slab belongs to the lower Silurian formation, the first  in which organic remains are found. It is probably from the Trenton  epoch of that age. If geologists can be trusted, at the time the  little animals, whose remains are thus preserved, were living, the  only part of this continent which had appeared above the primeval  ocean was a strip of land along the present St. Lawrence River and the  northern shores of the great lakes, with a promontory reaching out  toward the Adirondacks, and a few islands along what is now the  Atlantic coast line.--_Bennington (Vt.) Banner._           *       *       *       *       *          COWPER'S WRITING TELEGRAPH.      The most recent of the brilliant series of telegraphic marvels which  has from time to time, and especially of late, engaged the attention  of the world, is the \"telegraphic pen\" of Mr. E. A. Cowper, the well  known engineer of Great George street, Westminster. This ingenious  apparatus, which constitutes the first real telegraph, was publicly  shown by its inventor at the meeting of the Society of Telegraph  Engineers on Wednesday, February 26.    There had been no lack of copying telegraphs hitherto. We have  Bakewell's, Casselli's, Meyer's, and D'Arlincourt's, so recently tried  at our General Post Office by Mr. Preece. All of these instruments  telegraph an almost perfect copy of the writing or sketch submitted to  them by means of synchronous mechanism. But the process is necessarily  complex and slow; whereas by the new device a person may take the  writing pencil in his hand, and himself transmit his message in the  act of writing it.    The principle which guided Mr. Cowper to a solution of the problem  which he has successfully overcome, is the well known mathematical  fact that the position of any point in a curve can be determined by  its distance from two rectangular co-ordinates. It follows, then, that  every position of the point of a pencil, stylus, or pen, as it forms a  letter, can be determined by its distance from two fixed lines, say  the adjacent edges of the paper. Moreover it is obvious that if these  distances could be transmitted by telegraph and recombined so as to  give a resultant motion to a duplicate pen, a duplicate copy of the  original writing would be produced. But inasmuch as the writing stylus  moves continuously over the paper, the process of transmission would  require to be a continuous one; that is to say, the current traversing  the telegraph line, and conveying the distances in question (or what  comes to the same thing, the up and down, and direct sidelong ranges  of the stylus) would require to vary continuously in accordance with  the range to be transmitted.    Mr. Cowper effects this by employing two separate telegraphic  circuits, each with its own wire, battery, sending, and receiving  apparatus. One of these circuits is made to transmit the up and down  component writing of the pencil's motion, while the other  simultaneously transmits its sidelong component. At the receiving  station these two components are then recomposed by a pantograph  arrangement of taut cords, or levers, and the resultant motion is  communicated to the duplicate pen at that place. The plan adopted by  Mr. Cowper to transmit each continuously varying component is to cause  the resistance of the circuit to vary very closely with the component  in question. Fig. 5 shows how the apparatus is theoretically arranged  for this purpose. P is the writing style, which is held in the  writer's hand in the ordinary way, while he shapes the letters one by  one on paper pulled uniformly underneath by means of clockwork. To P  are attached, at right angles, two arms, a a, one for each circuit;  but as it is only necessary to consider one of the circuits, say that  sending up and down motions, we will confine our attention for the  present to the arm, a. One pole of the sending battery, B, is  connected to the arm, a, the other pole being connected to earth. Now  the arm, a, is fitted with a sliding contact at its free extremity,  and as the pencil, P, is moved in writing, a slides lengthwise across  the edges of a series of thin metal contact plates, C, insulated from  each other by paraffined paper. Between each pair of these plates  there is a resistance coil, C, and the last of these is connected  through the last plate to the line, L. It will be seen that as a  slides outward across the plates the current from the battery has to  pass through fewer coils, since a short-circuits a number of coils  proportional to its motion. But the fewer of these coils in circuit  the stronger will be the current in the line; so that the extent of  the motion of the arm, a, in the direction of its length, that is to  say, the direct component of the motion of the pencil along the line  of the arm, a, is attended by a corresponding change in the current  traversing the line. If the pencil makes a long up and down stroke  there will be a strong current in the line, if a short one there will  be a weak current, and so on. A precisely similar arrangement is used  to transmit the sidelong motion of the pencil along the line, L.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]    The current from the line, L, flows at the receiving station through a  powerful galvanometer, G, to earth. The galvanometer has a stout  needle, one tip of which is connected to a duplicate pen, P, by a  thread, t, which is kept taut by a second thread stretched by a  spring, s'. The current from the line, L', flows through a similar  galvanometer, G', to earth. The needle of G' is also connected to the  pen, P, by a taut thread, t', stretched by means of the spring, s.  Now, since the needle of each of these galvanometers deflects in  proportion to the strength of the current flowing through its coil,  the points of these two needles keep moving with the varying currents.  But since these currents vary the motions of the sending pen, the  receiving pen controlled by the united movements of the needles will  trace out a close copy of the original writing. We give on another  page a facsimile of a sentence written by Mr. Cowper's telegraph.    [Illustration: THE COWPER WRITING TELEGRAPH.]    The receiving pen is a fine glass siphon, drawing off aniline ink from  a small glass holder. There are thirty-two coils, C, in each circuit,  with a corresponding number of contact plates, c, so as to get  accuracy of working. A few Daniell's cells are sufficient to operate  the apparatus, and writing has been already sent successfully over a  line 40 miles in length. The writing may be received either of the  same size or larger or smaller than the original, as the case may be.  At present the writing must not be too hurried, that is, unless the  characters are bold and well formed; but further improvement will, of  course, quicken the working of the apparatus.    The engravings, Figs. 1 to 4, illustrate the actual apparatus. Fig. 4  is a plan of the sending instrument, with the writing pencil, a, the  traveling paper, b, the light connecting rods or arms, d (which  correspond to a in the theoretical diagram above), the series of metal  contact plates over which these arms slide, the resistance coils  connected to these plates, and the battery and line wires. It will be  seen that each arm, d, is connected to its particular battery, and  each set of contact plates to its particular line. Fig. 3 is an  elevation of the sending instrument, in which a is the pencil as  before, c c the contact plates over which the arms, d d, slide, f f  the coils, and b the traveling slip of paper.    Fig. 2 is a plan of the receiving instrument, in which h h are the  light pivoted needles surrounded by coils of fine insulated copper  wires, i i, and controlled in their zero position by the  electro-magnets, j j j j, placed underneath, the whole forming a pair  of galvanoscopes or current detecters, one for each line. It will be  understood that the varying currents from the lines are allowed to  flow through the coils, i i, so as to deflect the needles, and that  the deflections of the needles follow, so to speak, the variations of  the currents. The electro-magnets are magnetized by a local battery;  permanent magnets might, however, take their place with a gain in  simplicity.    Now the writing pen, k, is connected to the nearest tip of the needle,  h, of each galvanoscope by threads, n n, which are kept taut by the  fibers, o_{1} o_{2} o_{3}, the springs, o, and the pins, o_{4}. In  this way the motions of the needles are recombined in the motion of  the duplicate pen upon the paper, p.

[Footnote 1: It should be noted that the purchasing power of money was  then approximately four times higher than at present.]          Our Russian Ally    By Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace.      LAIDLAWSTIEL, Oct. 5, 1914.    The Publications Committee of the Victoria League, which is endeavoring  to enlighten the general public on the origin and issues of the war, has  suggested to me that, as Russia is now in alliance with us, I might  write an article on her recent advance in civilization and the ideals of  her people. To condense satisfactorily such a big subject into a few  pages seems to me hardly possible; but, considering that we are embarked  on a great national undertaking in which it is the sacred duty of every  loyal subject to lend a hand according to his abilities, I cannot refuse  to comply with the committee's suggestion.    To many thoughtful observers of current events it must seem strange that  in the present worldwide convulsion we should be fighting vigorously on  the same side as Russia, who has long been regarded as one of our  natural enemies. Some worthy people may even feel qualms of conscience  at finding themselves in such questionable company, and may be disposed  to inquire how far we are politically and morally justified in thus  putting aside, even for a time, our traditional convictions. It is  mainly for the benefit of such conscientious doubters, who deserve  sympathy, that I have undertaken my present task; and I propose to place  before them certain facts and considerations which may help them in  their difficulties. For this purpose, I begin by examining the grounds  on which the traditional conceptions are founded.    If we were to question a dozen fairly intelligent, educated Englishmen  why Russia has usually been regarded as a hereditary enemy and an  impossible ally, they would probably give two main reasons: First, that  she is the modern stronghold of barbarism, ignorance and tyrannical  government, and, secondly, that she threatens our interests in  Southeastern Europe and Central Asia. Let us examine dispassionately  these two contentions.    As to barbarism, there is no doubt that in the general march of  civilization Russia long remained far behind her West European sisters  and that she has not yet quite overtaken them, but it should be  remembered--and here I appeal to the Englishman's proverbial love of  fair play--that she did not get a fair start. Living on an immense plain  which stretches far into Asia, her population was for centuries  constantly exposed to the incursions of lawless, predatory hordes, and  this life-and-death struggle culminated in the so-called Mongol  domination, during which her native princes were tributary vassals of  the great Tartar Khan. Under such circumstances she could hardly be  expected to make much social progress, and she was further impeded by  difficulties of intercourse with the more favored nations of the West,  from whom she was separated by differences of language, customs and  religious beliefs. It was as if Europe had been divided into two halves  by a formidable barrier, which condemned the unfortunate Russians to  isolation. The herculean task of demolishing this barrier was, as we all  know, begun by Peter the Great. He built for himself a new capital on  the northwest frontier of his dominions--the beautiful city on the Neva,  recently christened Petrograd--in order to have, as he expressed it, a  window through which he might look into Europe. He looked into Europe  with very good results, and his successors have done likewise; but the  demolition of the barrier proved a very tedious undertaking, and it was  not completed till comparatively recent times.    The laudable efforts of the Russians to make up for lost time have been  particularly successful during the last fifty years. Immediately after  the Crimean War, which some of us are old enough to remember distinctly,  a new era of progress began. The Czar of that time, Nicholas I., whose  name is still familiar to the present generation, was a patriotic,  chivalrous, well-intentioned man, but unfortunately, as a ruler, he  belonged to the mailed-fist school, delighted in shining armor, and put  his faith largely in drill sergeants. Even in the civil administration  he fostered the spirit of military discipline, and he was at no pains to  conceal his contemptuous dislike of the self-government and  constitutional liberties of other countries. By unsympathetic critics he  has been not inaptly described as \"the Don Quixote of Autocracy,\" and  for thirty years he remained faithful to his principles; but toward the  close of his reign, in his struggle with England and France, he learned  by bitter experience that true national greatness is not to be found in  militarism. This salutary lesson was happily laid to heart by his son  and successor, Alexander II., and the more enlightened of his subjects.  The period of triumphant militarism was accordingly followed by a period  of national repentance, which was also a memorable epoch of beneficent  reforms and genuine progress.    No sooner was peace concluded in 1856 than premonitory symptoms of the  new order of things became apparent in St. Petersburg, in Moscow, and  throughout the country generally. To all who had eyes to see and ears to  hear, the war had proved that if their country was to compete  successfully with its rivals, it must adopt a whole series of  administrative and economic reforms; and there was a general desire that  those reforms should be undertaken as speedily as possible. The young  Czar took the lead in the work of national regeneration, and he had the  good fortune to find sympathy and co-operation among the educated  classes. For the first time in Russian history--for on previous  occasions the efforts of reforming Czars had always encountered a good  deal of passive resistance--the Government and the people were anxious  to aid each other, and the main results may be described as eminently  satisfactory. Three great reforms deserve special mention--the  emancipation of the serfs, the radical reorganization of the civil and  criminal courts, and a great extension of local self-government.    By the emancipation decree of 1861, which had been carefully prepared by  liberal-minded officials in conjunction with local committees of the  landed proprietors, the millions of serfs, who had been habitually  bought and sold with the estates on which they were settled, and who had  known no law except the arbitrary will of their masters, were  transformed suddenly into a class of free and independent citizens! Next  came the reorganization of the judicial administration, by which a  similar beneficent change was effected. In the old times the civil and  criminal tribunals had been hotbeds of bribery and corruption to such an  extent that a satirical author had once ventured to write a comedy with  the significant title, \"An Unheard-of Wonder; or, The Honest Clerk of  Court!\" Now they were thoroughly cleansed, and during some half a dozen  years, when I traveled about the country in search of information, I  never heard of a Judge suspected of taking bribes. The lawsuits, which  were previously liable to be prolonged for a lifetime, were curtailed by  simplifying the procedure; trial by jury was introduced for criminal  cases; and the condition of the prisoners was greatly improved both  materially and morally. Some of the new prisons were quite excellent. A  big reformatory, for example, founded by a benevolent society in Moscow  and largely supported by voluntary contributions, seemed to me the best  institution of the kind I had ever seen.    Regarding the new system of local self-government, I may say briefly  that I was very favorably impressed by the results. The first time I  followed, as an attentive spectator, the proceedings of a Provincial  Assembly, I was fairly astonished. It was in 1870--only nine years after  the beginning of the great reforms--and already the local affairs were  being discussed, on a footing of perfect equality, by noble landed  proprietors in fashionable European costume and emancipated serfs in  sheepskins. Some of the peasants were very able, unpretentious speakers,  and in one respect they had an advantage over some of their former  masters--they knew thoroughly what they were talking about. While the  frock-coated young gentlemen who had finished their education in a  university or agricultural college were often inclined to deal in  scientific abstractions, their humble colleagues, who had come direct  from the plow, confined themselves to thoroughly practical remarks, and  usually exercised a very beneficial influence on the discussions.    The favorable impressions which I received from this Provincial Assembly  were subsequently confirmed by wider experience, especially when I  worked regularly during a Winter in the head office of the local  administration of the Novgorod province. The chief defect of the new  institutions seemed to me to be the very pardonable habit of attempting  too much, without duly estimating the available resources. This  illustrates a very important national characteristic--intense impatience  to obtain gigantic results in an incredibly short space of time. Unlike  the English, who crawl cautiously along the rugged path of progress,  looking attentively to the right and to the left, and seeking to avoid  obstacles and circumvent opposition by conciliation and compromise, the  Russian dashes boldly into the unknown, keeping his eye fixed on the  distant goal and striving to follow a beeline, regardless of obstacles  and pitfalls. The natural consequence is that his moments of sanguine  enthusiasm are frequently followed by hours of depression bordering on  despair, when he is inclined to attribute his"]]]
