Not for  one day did it rest, nay its sicknesses waxed more severe, as it fell  under the treatment of unskilled physicians who have spurred on the steed  of their worldly desires and have erred grievously. And if at one time,  through the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed,  the rest remained afflicted as before. Thus informeth you the All-Knowing,  the All-Wise.... That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy  and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of  all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no  wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful  and inspired Physician. This verily is the truth, and all else naught but  error.\"    In a further passage Baha'u'llah adds these words: \"We see you adding  every year unto your expenditures and laying the burden thereof on the  people whom ye rule; this verily is naught but grievous injustice. Fear  the sighs and tears of this Wronged One, and burden not your peoples  beyond that which they can endure.... Be reconciled among yourselves, that  ye may need armaments no more save in a measure to safeguard your  territories and dominions. Be united, O concourse of the sovereigns of the  world, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you and  your peoples find rest. Should any one among you take up arms against  another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest  justice.\"    What else could these weighty words signify if they did not point to the  inevitable curtailment of unfettered national sovereignty as an  indispensable preliminary to the formation of the future Commonwealth of  all the nations of the world? Some form of a world super-state must needs  be evolved, in whose favor all the nations of the world will have  willingly ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation  and all rights to maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining  internal order within their respective dominions. Such a state will have  to include within its orbit an international executive adequate to enforce  supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the  commonwealth; a world parliament whose members shall be elected by the  people in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed  by their respective governments; and a supreme tribunal whose judgment  will have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned  did not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its consideration. A  world community in which all economic barriers will have been permanently  demolished and the interdependence of Capital and Labor definitely  recognized; in which the clamor of religious fanaticism and strife will  have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will  have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of international  law--the product of the considered judgment of the world's federated  representatives--shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive  intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and finally a  world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism  will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world  citizenship--such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order  anticipated by Baha'u'llah, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the  fairest fruit of a slowly maturing age.    \"The Tabernacle of Unity,\" Baha'u'llah proclaims in His message to all  mankind, \"has been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers.... Of  one tree are all ye the fruit and of one bough the leaves.... The world is  but one country and mankind its citizens.... Let not a man glory in that  he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his  kind.\"          Unity in Diversity      Let there be no misgivings as to the animating purpose of the world-wide  Law of Baha'u'llah. Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing  foundations of society, it seeks to broaden its basis, to remold its  institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an ever-changing  world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it  undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame  of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men's hearts, nor to abolish the  system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of excessive  centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt  to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of  language and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the  peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a  larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race. It insists  upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the  imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive  centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on  the other. Its watchword is unity in diversity such as 'Abdu'l-Baha  Himself has explained:    \"Consider the flowers of a garden. Though differing in kind, color, form  and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of one  spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one  sun, this diversity increaseth their charm and addeth unto their beauty.  How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and plants, the leaves and  blossoms, the fruit, the branches and the trees of that garden were all of  the same shape and color! Diversity of hues, form and shape enricheth and  adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof. In like manner,  when divers shades of thought, temperament and character, are brought  together under the power and influence of one central agency, the beauty  and glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest. Naught  but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and  transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing the  divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas and convictions of the children of  men.\"    The call of Baha'u'llah is primarily directed against all forms of  provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cherished ideals  and time-honored institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious  formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind,  if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving  humanity, let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent  and forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the  immutable law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that  must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards,  political and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the  interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the  preservation of the integrity of any particular law or doctrine.          The Principle of Oneness      Let there be no mistake. The principle of the Oneness of Mankind--the pivot  round which all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve --is no mere outburst  of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. Its  appeal is not to be merely identified with a reawakening of the spirit of  brotherhood and good-will among men, nor does it aim solely at the  fostering of harmonious coeoperation among individual peoples and nations.  Its implications are deeper, its claims greater than any which the  Prophets of old were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not  only to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of  those essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as  members of one human family. It does not constitute merely the enunciation  of an ideal, but stands inseparably associated with an institution  adequate to embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and perpetuate its  influence. It implies an organic change in the structure of present-day  society, a change such as the world has not yet experienced. It  constitutes a challenge, at once bold and universal, to outworn  shibboleths of national creeds--creeds that have had their day and which  must, in the ordinary course of events as shaped and controlled by  Providence, give way to a new gospel, fundamentally different from, and  infinitely superior to, what the world has already conceived. It calls for  no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole  civilized world--a world organically unified in all the essential aspects  of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade  and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of  the national characteristics of its federated units.    It represents the consummation of human evolution--an evolution that has  had its earliest beginnings in the birth of family life, its subsequent  development in the achievement of tribal solidarity, leading in turn to  the constitution of the city-state, and expanding later into the  institution of independent and sovereign nations.    The principle of the Oneness of Mankind, as proclaimed by Baha'u'llah,  carries with it no more and no less than a solemn assertion that  attainment to this final stage in this stupendous evolution is not only  necessary but inevitable, that its realization is fast approaching, and  that nothing short of a power that is born of God can succeed in  establishing it.    So marvellous a conception finds its earliest manifestations in the  efforts consciously exerted and the modest beginnings already achieved by  the declared adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah who, conscious of the  sublimity of their calling and initiated into the ennobling principles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#9)"],[1,"these diversities were out  of regard for the requirements of the time, season, ages, and epochs. O  unitarians, make firm the girdle of endeavor, that perchance religious  strife and conflict may be removed from amongst the people of the world  and be annulled. For love of God and His servants engage in this great and  mighty matter. Religious hatred and rancor is a world-consuming fire, and  the quenching thereof most arduous, unless the hand of Divine Might give  men deliverance from this unfruitful calamity. Consider a war which  happeneth between two states: both sides have foregone wealth and life:  how many villages were beheld as though they were not! This precept is in  the position of the light in the lamp of utterance.\"    \"O people of the world, ye are all the fruit of one tree and the leaves of  one branch. Walk with perfect charity, concord, affection, and agreement.  I swear by the Sun of Truth, the light of agreement shall brighten and  illumine the horizons. The all-knowing Truth hath been and is the witness  to this saying. Endeavor to attain to this high supreme station which is  the station of protection and preservation of mankind. This is the intent  of the King of intentions, and this the hope of the Lord of hopes.\"    \"We trust that God will assist the kings of the earth to illuminate and  adorn the earth with the refulgent light of the Sun of Justice. At one  time We spoke in the language of the Law, at another time in the language  of the Truth and the Way; and the ultimate object and remote aim was the  showing forth of this high supreme station. And God sufficeth for  witness.\"    \"O friends, consort with all the people of the world with joy and  fragrance. If there be to you a word or essence whereof others than you  are devoid, communicate it and show it forth in the language of affection  and kindness: if it be received and be effective the object is attained,  and if not leave it to him, and with regard to him deal not harshly but  pray. The language of kindness is the lodestone of hearts and the food of  the soul; it stands in the relation of ideas to words, and is as an  horizon for the shining of the Sun of Wisdom and Knowledge.\"    \"If the unitarians had in the latter times acted according to the glorious  Law [which came] after His Highness the Seal [of the Prophets] (may the  life of all beside Him be His sacrifice!), and had clung to its skirt, the  foundation of the fortress of religion would not have been shaken, and  populous cities would not have been ruined, but rather cities and villages  would have acquired and been adorned with the decoration of peace and  serenity.\"    \"Through the heedlessness and discordance of the favored people and the  smoke of wicked souls the Fair Nation is seen to be darkened and  enfeebled. Had they acted [according to what they knew] they would not  have been heedless of the light of the Sun of Justice.\"    \"This Victim hath from earliest days until now been afflicted at the hands  of the heedless. They exiled Us without cause at one time to 'Iraq, at  another time to Adrianople, and thence to Akka, which was a place of exile  for murderers and robbers; neither is it known where and in what spot We  shall take up Our abode after this greatest prison-house. Knowledge is  with God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust and the Lord of the lofty  seat. In whatever place We may be, and whatever befall Us, the saints must  gaze with perfect steadfastness and confidence towards the Supreme Horizon  and occupy themselves in the reformation of the world and the education of  the nations. What hath befallen and shall befall hath been and is an  instrument and means for the furtherance of the Word of Unity. Take hold  of the command of God and cling thereto: verily it hath been sent down  from beside a wise Ordainer.\"    \"With perfect compassion and mercy have We guided and directed the people  of the world to that whereby their souls shall be profited. I swear by the  Sun of Truth which hath shone forth from the highest horizons of the world  that the people of Baha had not and have not any aim save the prosperity  and reformation of the world and the purifying of the nations. With all  men they have been in sincerity and charity. Their outward [appearance] is  one with their inward [heart], and their inward [heart] identical with  their outward [appearance]. The truth of the matter is not hidden or  concealed, but plain and evident before [men's] faces. Their very deeds  are the witness of this assertion. Today let everyone endowed with vision  win his way from deeds and signs to the object of the people of Baha and  from their speech and conduct gain knowledge of their intent. The waves of  the ocean of divine mercy appear at the utmost height, and the showers of  the clouds of His grace and favor descend every moment. During the days of  sojourn in 'Iraq this Oppressed One sat down and consorted with all  classes without veil or disguise. How many of the denizens of the horizons  entered in enmity and went forth in sympathy! The door of grace was open  before the faces of all. With rebellious and obedient did We outwardly  converse after one fashion, that perchance the evildoers might win their  way to the ocean of boundless forgiveness. The splendors of the Name of  the Concealer were in such wise manifested that the evildoer imagined that  he was accounted of the good. No messenger was disappointed and no  inquirer was turned back. The causes of the aversion and avoidance of men  were certain of the doctors of Persia and the unseemly deeds of the  ignorant. By [the term] 'doctors' in these passages are signified those  persons who have withheld mankind from the shore of the Ocean of Unity;  but as for the learned who practice [their knowledge] and the wise who act  justly, they are as the spirit unto the body of the world. Well is it with  that learned man whose head is adorned with the crown of justice, and  whose body glorieth in the ornament of honesty. The Pen of Admonition  exhorteth the friends and enjoineth on them charity, pity, wisdom, and  gentleness. The Oppressed One is this day a prisoner; His allies are the  hosts of good deeds and virtues; not ranks, and hosts, and guns, and  cannons.(21) One holy action maketh the world of earth highest paradise.    \"O friends, help the Oppressed One with well-pleasing virtues and good  deeds! Today let every soul desire to attain the highest station. He must  not regard what is in him, but what is in God. It is not for him to regard  what shall advantage himself, but that whereby the Word of God which must  be obeyed shall be upraised. The heart must be sanctified from every form  of selfishness and lust, for the weapons of the unitarians and the saints  were and are the fear of God. That is the buckler which guardeth man from  the arrows of hatred and abomination. Unceasingly hath the standard of  piety been victorious, and accounted amongst the most puissant hosts of  the world. Thereby do the saints subdue the cities of [men's] hearts by  the permission of God, the Lord of hosts. Darkness hath encompassed the  earth: the lamp which giveth light was and is wisdom. The dictates thereof  must be observed under all circumstances. And of wisdom is the regard of  place and the utterance of discourse according to measure and state. And  of wisdom is decision; for man should not accept whatsoever anyone sayeth.    \"Under all circumstances desire of the True One (glorious is His glory)  that He will not deprive His servants of the sealed wine(22) and the  lights of the Name of the Self-Subsistent.    \"O friends of God, verily the Pen of Sincerity enjoineth on you the  greatest faithfulness. By the Life of God, its light is more evident than  the light of the sun! In its light and its brightness and its radiance  every light is eclipsed. We desire of God that He will not withhold from  His cities and lands the radiant effulgence of the Sun of Faithfulness. We  have directed all in the nights and in the days to faithfulness, chastity,  purity, and constancy; and have enjoined good deeds and well-pleasing  qualities. In the nights and in the days the shriek of the pen ariseth and  the tongue speaketh, that against the sword the word may arise, and  against fierceness patience, and in place of oppression submission, and at  the time of martyrdom resignation. For thirty years and more, in all that  hath befallen this oppressed community they have been patient, referring  it to God. Everyone endowed with justice and fairness hath testified and  doth testify to that which hath been said. During this period this  Oppressed One was engaged in good exhortations and efficacious and  sufficient admonitions, till it became established and obvious before all  that this Victim had made Himself a target for the arrows of calamity unto  the showing forth of the treasures deposited in [men's] souls. Strife and  contest were and are seemly in the beasts of prey of the earth, [but]  laudable actions are seemly in man.    \"Blessed is the Merciful One: Who created man: and taught him  utterance.(23) After all these troubles, neither are the ministers of  state content, nor the doctors of the church. Not one soul was found to  utter a word for God before the court of His Majesty the King (may God  perpetuate his kingdom). There shall not befall Us aught save that which  God hath decreed unto Us. They acted not kindly, nor was there any  shortcoming in the display of evil. Justice became like the phoenix, and  faithfulness like the philosopher's stone: none spake for the right. It  would seem that justice had become hateful to men and cast forth from all  lands like the people of God. Glory be to God! In the episode of the land  of Ta not one spoke for that which God had commanded. Having regard to the  display of power and parade of service in the presence of the King (may  God perpetuate his kingdom) they have"]]]
