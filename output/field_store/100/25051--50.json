You need not confine yourself exactly to the dimensions of the army  shelter-tent, but for a pedestrian something of the sort is necessary  if he will camp out. I have never seen a \"shelter\" made of _three_  breadths of drilling (seven feet three inches long), but I should think  it would be a good thing for four or five men to take.[14] And I should  recommend that they make three-sided end-pieces instead of taking  additional half-tents complete, for in the latter case one-half of the  cloth is useless.    Five feet is _long_ enough for a tent made on the \"shelter\" principle;  when pitched with the roof at a right angle it is 3-1/2 feet high, and  nearly seven feet wide on the ground.    Although a shelter-tent is a poor substitute for a house, it is as good  a protection as you can well carry if you propose to walk any distance.  It should be pitched neatly, or it will leak. In heavy, pelting rains a  fine spray will come through on the windward side. The sides should set  at right angles to each other, or at a sharper angle if rain is  expected.    There are rubber blankets made with eyelets along the edges so that two  can be tied together to make a tent; but they are heavier, more  expensive, and not much if any better; and you will need other rubber  blankets to lie upon.    If you wish for a larger and more substantial covering than a \"shelter,\"  and propose to do the work yourself, you will do well to have a  sailmaker or a tent-maker cut the cloth, and show you how the work is to  be done. If you cannot have their help, you must at least have the  assistance of one used to planning and cutting needle-work, to whom the  following hints may not be lost. We will suppose heavy drilling 29-1/2  inches wide to be used in all instances.      THE A-TENT.    To make an A-tent,[15] draw upon the floor a straight line seven feet  long, to represent the upright pole or height of the tent; then draw a  line at right angles to and across the end of the first one, to  represent the ground or bottom of the tent. Complete the plan by finding  where the corners will be on the ground line, and drawing the two sides  (roof) from the corners[16] to the top of the pole-line. This triangle  is a trifle larger than the front and back of the tent will be.    The cloth should be cut so that the twilled side shall be the outside of  the tent, as it sheds the rain better.    Place the cloth on the floor against the ground-line, and tack it (to  hold it fast) to the pole-line, which it should overlap 3/8 of an inch;  then cut by the roof-line. Turn the cloth over, and cut another piece  exactly like the first; this second piece will go on the back of the  tent. Now place the cloth against the ground-line as before, but upon  the other side of the pole, and tack it to the floor after you have  overlapped the selvage of the piece first cut 3/4 of an inch. Cut by the  roof-line, and turn and cut again for the back of the tent.    In cutting the four small gores for the corners, you can get all the  cloth from one piece, and thus save waste, by turning and tearing it in  two; these gore-pieces also overlap the longer breadths 3/4 of an inch.    The three breadths that make the sides or roof are cut all alike; their  length is found by measuring the plan from corner to corner over the  top; in the plan now under consideration, the distance will be nearly  sixteen feet. When you sew them, overlap the breadths 3/4 of an inch the  same as you do the end-breadths.    In sewing you can do no better than to run, with a machine, a row of  stitching as near each selvage as possible; you will thus have two rows  to each seam, which makes it strong enough. Use the coarsest cotton, No.  10 or 12.    The sides and two ends are made separately; when you sew them together  care must be taken, for the edges of the ends are cut cross-grained, and  will stretch very much more than the cloth of the sides (roof). About as  good a seam as you can make, in sewing together the sides and ends, is  to place the two edges together, and fold them outwards (or what will be  downwards when the tent is pitched) twice, a quarter of an inch each  time, and put two rows of stitching through if done on a machine, or one  if with sail-needle and twine. This folding the cloth six-ply, besides  making a good seam, strengthens the tent where the greatest strain  comes. It is also advisable to put facings in the two ends of the top of  the tent, to prevent the poles from pushing through and chafing.    The bottom of the tent is completed next by folding upwards and inwards  two inches of cloth to make what is called a \"tabling,\" and again  folding in the raw edge about a quarter of an inch, as is usual to make  a neat job. Some makers enclose a marline or other small tarred rope to  strengthen the foot of the tent, and it is well to do so. One edge of  what is called the \"sod-cloth\" is folded in with the raw edge, and  stitched at the same time. This cloth, which is six to eight inches  wide, runs entirely around the bottom of the tent, excepting the  door-flap, and prevents a current of air from sweeping under the tent,  and saves the bottom from rotting; the sod-cloth, however, will rot or  wear out instead, but you can replace it much more easily than you can  repair the bottom of the tent; consequently it is best to put one on.    One door is enough in an A-tent; but, if you prefer two, be sure that  one at least is nicely fitted and well provided with tapes or buttons,  or both: otherwise you will have a cheerless tent in windy and rainy  weather. The door-flap is usually made of a strip of cloth six to nine  inches wide, sewed to the selvage of the breadth that laps inside; the  top of it is sewed across the inside of the other breadth, and reaches  to the corner seam. Tent-makers usually determine the height of the door  by having the top of the flap reach from selvage to seam as just  described; the narrower the flap is, the higher the door will be. Some  make the door-flap considerably wider at the bottom than at the top, and  thus provide against the many annoyances that arise from one too narrow.    The loops (or \"beckets\" as they are called) that fasten to the tent-pins  are put in one at each side of the door and at every seam. Some makers  work an eyelet or put a grommet in the seam; but, in the army-tents  which are made of duck, there are two eyelets worked, one on each side  of the seam, and a six-thread manilla rope is run through and held in by  knotting the ends.    The door is tied together by two double rows of stout tapes[17] sewed on  at intervals of about eighteen inches; one inside the tent ties the  door-flap to the opposite breadth, and a second set outside pulls  together the two selvages of the centre breadths. Do not slight this  work: a half-closed door, short tapes, and a door-flap that is slapping  all the time, are things that will annoy you beyond endurance.    The upright poles of a tent such as has been described should be an inch  or two more than seven feet, for the cloth will stretch. If you have a  sod-cloth, the poles should be longer still.[18]      THE WALL-TENT.    The wall-tent is shaped like a house: the walls or sides, which are  perpendicular, are four feet high. A continuous piece of cloth runs from  the ground to the eaves, thence on toward the ridgepole, and down the  other side to the ground. The tent is made on the same general  principles as the one last described. It is four breadths square, but  the width is usually diminished about one foot by cutting six inches  from each corner breadth. If the cloth is drilling or light duck, you  can overlap the centre breadths a foot, and thus have the doors  ready-made.    Draw a plan upon the floor as in the other case; the pole nine feet and  two inches high, the corners four breadths apart less the overlappings  and the narrowing; draw the wall (in the plan only) four feet and two  inches high. The roof-line runs of course from the top of the pole to  the top of the wall.    Cut the cloth, as before, so as to have the twilled side out. Add six  inches to the distance measured on the plan, for the length of the walls  and roof, so as to get cloth for the eaves.    The wall is to be four feet high; consequently, when you have sewed  together the four breadths that make the roof and walls, measure four  feet 3-1/2 inches from the ends (bottoms), double the cloth, and sew  two rows of stitching by hand across from side to side, 1-1/2 inches  from the doubling; this makes the tabling for the eaves, and you have  two inches left for the bottom tabling. Use stout twine for these seams  at the eaves, and take only three to four stitches to the inch.    Take the same care as before in sewing together the ends and sides; the  larger the tent, the more this difficulty increases.    The sod-cloth becomes more of a necessity as we increase the size of the  tent, and add to the difficulty of making it fit snugly to the ground.    Facings should be put in where the ends of the poles bear, as before  explained; and also in the four upper corners of the wall, to prevent  the strain of the corner guy-lines from ripping apart the eaves and  wall.    Beckets must be put in the bottom of each seam and the door, the same as  in the A-tent, and strong tapes sewed to the door.    Guy-lines made of six-thread manilla rope are put in at the four corners  of the eaves, and at every seam along that tabling, making five upon  each side. Work an eyelet, or put a grommet, in the doubled cloth of the  seam; knot the end of the guy-line to prevent its pulling through: tying  the rope makes too bungling a job, and splicing it is too much work.  The six guy-lines in the body of the tent should be about nine feet  long, the four corner ones about a foot longer.

He levied immediately a heavy  contribution (eight hundred thousand pounds sterling) at Milan,--taking  possession, besides, of twenty of the finest pictures in the Ambrosian  gallery.    The conqueror now paused to look about and behind him; and proceeded  still farther to replenish his chest by exactions, for which no  justification can be adduced from the ordinary rules of international  law. With Sardinia he had already reckoned; of the Austrian capital in  Italy he had possession; there was only one more of the Italian  governments (Naples) with which the French Republic was actually at war;  although, indeed, he had never concealed his intention of revenging the  fate of Basseville on the court of Rome. The other powers of Italy were,  at worst, neutrals; with Tuscany and Venice, France had friendly  relations. But Napoleon knew or believed, that all the Italian  governments, without exception, considered the French invasion of Italy  as a common calamity; the personal wishes of most of the minor princes  (nearly connected as these were, by blood or alliance, with the imperial  house of Austria) he, not unreasonably, concluded were strongly against  his own success in this great enterprise. Such were his pretences--more  or less feasible; the temptation was, in fact, great; and he resolved to  consider and treat whatever had not been with him as if it had been  against him. The weak but wealthy princes of Parma and Modena, and  others of the same order, were forthwith compelled to purchase his  clemency not less dearly than if they had been in arms. Besides money,  of which he made them disburse large sums, he demanded from each a  tribute of pictures and statues, to be selected at the discretion of  Citizen Monge and other French connoisseurs, who now attended his march  for such purposes.    In modern warfare the works of art had hitherto been considered as a  species of property entitled in all cases to be held sacred; and  Buonaparte's violent and rapacious infraction of this rule now excited a  mighty clamour throughout Europe. Whether the new system originated with  himself, or in the commands of the Directory, is doubtful. But from this  time the formation of a great national gallery of pictures and statues  at Paris was considered as an object of the first importance; and every  victorious general was expected to bring trophies of this kind in his  train. Whether the fine arts themselves are likely to be improved in  consequence of the accumulation in any one place of such vast treasures  as the Louvre were long exhibited, there has been, and will no doubt  continue to be, much controversy. It is certain that the arts of France  derived no solid advantage from Napoleon's museum. The collection was a  mighty heap of incense for the benefit of the national vanity; and the  hand which brought it together was preparing the means of inflicting on  that vanity one of the most intolerable of wounds, in its ultimate  dispersion.    The Duke of Modena would fain have redeemed the famous St. Jerome, of  Correggio, at the price of L80,000; and Buonaparte's lieutenants urged  him to accept the money. \"No,\" said he, \"the duke's two millions of  francs would soon be spent; but his Correggio will remain for ages to  adorn Paris, and inspire the arts of France.\" The prophecy was not  inspired. Of one thing there can be no doubt; namely, that the  abstraction of these precious monuments of art from the Italian  collections was deeply and permanently resented by the Italian people.  This sacrilege, as those enthusiastic and intelligent lovers of all the  elegant arts considered it, turned back many a half-made convert from  the principles of the French Revolution.    Buonaparte remained but five days in Milan; the citadel of that place  still held out against him; but he left a detachment to blockade it, and  proceeded himself in pursuit of Beaulieu. The Austrian had now planted  the remains of his army behind the Mincio, having his left on the great  and strong city of Mantua, which has been termed \"the citadel of Italy,\"  and his right at Peschiera a Venetian fortress, of which he took  possession in spite of the remonstrances of the Doge. Peschiera stands  where the Mincio flows out of \"its parent lake,\" the Lago di Guarda.  That great body of waters, stretching many miles backwards towards the  Tyrolese Alps, at once extended the line of defence, and kept the  communication open with Vienna. The Austrian veteran occupied one of the  strongest positions that it is possible to imagine. The invader hastened  once more to dislodge him.    The French Directory, meanwhile, had begun to entertain certain not  unnatural suspicions as to the ultimate designs of their young general,  whose success and fame had already reached so astonishing a height. They  determined to check, if they could, the career of an ambition which they  apprehended might outgrow their control. Buonaparte was ordered to take  half his army, and lead it against the Pope and the King of Naples, and  leave the other half to terminate the contest with Beaulieu, under the  orders of Kellerman. But he acted on this occasion with the decision  which these Directors in vain desired to emulate. He answered by  resigning his command. \"One half of the army of Italy,\" said he, \"cannot  suffice to finish the matter with the Austrian. It is only by keeping my  force entire that I have been able to gain so many battles and to be now  in Milan. You had better have one bad general than two good ones.\" The  Directory durst not persist in displacing the chief whose name was  considered as the pledge of victory. Napoleon resumed the undivided  command, to which now, for the last time, his right had been questioned.    Another unlooked-for occurrence delayed, for a few days longer, the  march upon Mantua. The heavy exactions of the French, and even more  perhaps the wanton contempt with which they treated the churches and the  clergy, had produced or fostered the indignation of a large part of the  population throughout Lombardy. Reports of new Austrian levies being  poured down the passes of the Tyrol were spread and believed. Popular  insurrections against the conqueror took place in various districts: at  least 30,000 were in arms. At Pavia the insurgents were entirely  triumphant; they had seized the town, and compelled the French garrison  to surrender.    This flame, had it been suffered to spread, threatened immeasurable evil  to the French cause. Lannes instantly marched to Benasco, stormed the  place, plundered and burnt it, and put the inhabitants to the sword  without mercy. The general in person appeared before Pavia; blew the  gates open; easily scattered the townspeople; and caused the leaders to  be executed, as if they had committed a crime in endeavouring to rescue  their country from the arm of a foreign invader. Everywhere the same  ferocious system was acted on. The insurgent commanders were tried by  courts-martial, and shot without ceremony. At Lugo, where a French  squadron of horse had been gallantly and disastrously defeated, the  whole of the male inhabitants were massacred. These bloody examples  quelled the insurrections; but they fixed the first dark and indelible  stain on the name of Napoleon Buonaparte.    The spirit of the Austrian and Catholic parties in Lombardy thus  crushed, the French advanced on the Mincio. The general made such  disposition of his troops, that Beaulieu doubted not he meant to pass  that river, if he could, at Peschiera. Meantime he had been preparing to  repeat the scene of Placenza;--and actually, on the 30th of May, forced  the passage of the Mincio, not at Peschiera, but further down at  Borghetto. The Austrian garrison at Borghetto in vain destroyed one arch  of the bridge. Buonaparte supplied the breach with planks; and his men,  flushed with so many victories, charged with a fury not to be resisted.  Beaulieu was obliged to abandon the Mincio, as he had before the Adda  and the Po, and to take up the new line of the Adige.    Meanwhile an occurrence, which may be called accidental, had nearly done  more than repay the Austrians for all their reverses. The left of their  line, stationed still further down the Mincio,--at Puzzuolo, no sooner  learned from the cannonade that the French were at Borghetto, than they  hastened to ascend the stream, with the view of assisting the defence of  their friends. They came too late for this; the commander at Borghetto  had retreated before they arrived. They, however, came unexpectedly;  and, such was the chance, reached Valleggio after the French army had  pursued the Austrians through it and onwards--and, at the moment when  Buonaparte and a few friends, considering the work of the day to be  over, and this village as altogether in the rear of both armies, were  about to sit down to dinner in security. Sebetendorff, who commanded the  Puzzuolo division, came rapidly, little guessing what a prize was near  him, into the village. The French general's attendants had barely time  to shut the gates of the inn, and alarm their chief by the cry \"To  arms.\" Buonaparte threw himself on horseback, and galloping out by a  back passage, effected the narrowest of escapes from the most urgent of  dangers. Sebetendorff was soon assaulted by a French column, and  retreated, after Beaulieu's example, on the line of the Adige.  Buonaparte, profiting by the perilous adventure of Valleggio, instituted  a small corps of picked men, called _Guides_, to watch continually over  his personal safety. Such was the germ from which sprung the famous  Imperial Guard of Napoleon.    The Austrian had, in effect, abandoned for the time the open country of  Italy. He now lay on the frontier, between the vast tract of rich  provinces which Napoleon had conquered, and the Tyrol. The citadel of  Milan, indeed, still held out; but the force there was not great, and,"]]]
