Much indeed of the patriotism,      the honesty, the moral courage he exhibited, was really no other      than the refined ambition of attaining the respect of his      contemporaries and bequeathing a name to posterity. He might not      act from a sense of duty, like Cato, but his motives, personal and      selfish as they in some sense were, coincided with what a more      enlightened conscience would have felt to be duty. Thus his      proconsulate is perhaps the purest and most honorable passage in      his life. His strict and rare probity amidst the temptations of      office arrests our attention and extorts our praise: yet assuredly      Cicero had no nice sense of honor, and was controlled by no      delicacy of sentiment, where public opinion was silent, or a      transaction strictly private. His courting his ward Publilia for      her dower, his caressing Dolabella for the sake of getting his      debt paid, his soliciting the historian Lucceius to color and      exaggerate the merits of his consulship, display a grievous want      of magnanimity and of a predominant sense of right. Fortunately      his instinct taught him to see in the constitution of the republic      the fairest field for the display of his peculiar talents; the      orator and the pleader could not fail to love the arena on which      the greatest triumph of his genius had been or were yet, as he      hoped, to be acquired. And Cicero indeed was not less ambitious      than Caeesar or Pompeius, Antonius or Octavius. To the pursuit of      fame he sacrificed many interests and friendships. He was not less      jealous of a rival in his chosen career than any of the leaders of      party and candidates for popular favor. He could not endure      competition for the throne of eloquence and the sceptre of      persuasion. It was on this account perhaps that he sought his      associates among the young, from whose rivalry he had nothing to      fear, rather than from his own contemporaries, the candidates for      the same prize of public admiration which he aimed at securing for      himself. From his pages there flows an incessant stream of abuse      of all the great masters of political power in his time; of Caesar      and Pompeius; of Crassus and Antonius, not to mention his coarse      vituperation of Piso and Gabinius, and his uneasy sneers at the      impracticable Cato. We may note the different tone which his      disparagement assumes towards these men respectively. He speaks of      Caesar with awe, of Pompeius with mortification, with dislike of      Crassus, with bitter malice of Antonius. Caesar, even when he most      deeply reprobates him, he personally loves; the cold distrust of      Pompeius vexes his self-esteem; between him and Crassus there      subsists a natural antipathy of temperament: but Antonius, the      hate of his old age, becomes to him the incarnation of all the      evil his long and bitter experience of mankind have discovered in      the human heart. While we suspect Cicero of injustice towards the      great men of his day, we are bound also to specify the gross      dishonesty with which he magnifies his own merits where they are      trivial, and embellishes them where they are really important. The      perpetual recurrence to the topic of his own political deserts      must have wearied the most patient of friends, and more than      balanced the display of sordidness and time-serving which Atticus      doubtless reflected back in his share of the correspondence      between them.        \"But while Cicero stands justly charged with many grave      infirmities of temper and defects of principle, while we remark      with a sigh the vanity, the inconstancy, and the ingratitude he so      often manifested, while we lament his ignoble subserviencies and      his ferocious resentments, the high standard by which we claim to      judge him is in itself the fullest acknowledgment of his      transcendent merits. For undoubtedly had he not placed himself on      a higher moral level than the statesmen and sages of his day, we      should pass over many of his weaknesses in silence, and allow his      pretensions to our esteem to pass almost unchallenged. But we      demand a nearer approach to the perfection of human wisdom and      virtue in one who sought to approve himself the greatest of their      teachers. Nor need we scruple to admit that the judgment of the      ancients on Cicero was for the most part unfavorable. The      moralists of antiquity required in their heroes virtues with which      we can more readily dispense: and they too had less sympathy with      many qualities which a purer religion and a wider experience have      taught us to love and admire. Nor were they capable, from their      position, of estimating the slow and silent effects upon human      happiness of the lessons which Cicero enforced. After all the      severe judgments we are compelled to pass on his conduct, we must      acknowledge that there remains a residue of what is amiable in his      character and noble in his teaching beyond all ancient example.      Cicero lived and died in faith. He has made converts to the belief      in virtue, and had disciples in the wisdom of love. There have      been dark periods in the history of man, when the feeble ray of      religious instruction paled before the torch of his generous      philanthropy. The praise which the great critic pronounced upon      his excellence in oratory may be justly extended to the qualities      of his heart, and even in our enlightened days it may be held no      mean advance in virtue to venerate the master of Roman      philosophy.\"            LORD MAHON'S HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.      Incomparably the best history of our struggle for independence that has  been written by a foreigner is that of which we have the larger portion in  the just-published fifth and sixth volumes of Lord MAHON'S _History of  England from the Peace of Utrecht_, comprising the period from 1763 to  1780--from the commencement of the popular discontents until the virtual  conclusion of the war.    The character of Lord Mahon as a historian has long been established. When  Sismondi, in 1842, had brought his History of France down to the peace of  Aix-la-Chapelle, he lamented that he could no longer be guided by Lord  Mahon, and expressed a hope that his \"brilliant labors\" would be  continued. The portion of his work on which the illustrious Frenchman thus  set the seal of his approval has been reprinted in this country by the  Appletons, in two large volumes (embracing the first four of the original  impression), carefully and judiciously edited by Professor Henry Reed, of  Philadelphia. It well indicates the right of its author to a place with  the best British writers in this department. History was never before  written so brilliantly or profoundly as in the last half century. Germany  in this period has boasted her Schiller, Niebuhr, Von Hammer, Heeren,  Ranke, and two Mullers; France her Sismondi, Barrante, Thierrys, Michelet,  Mignet, Guizot, and Thiers; England her Mitford, Arnold, Thirlwall, Grote,  Napier, Hallam, Mackintosh, Macaulay, Palgrave, and Mahon; and we have  ourselves the noble names of Bancroft, Prescott, and Irving, to send to  the next ages. Of the English authors we have mentioned, we regard Lord  Mahon as in many respects the first; Hallam is a laborious and wise  critic; Thirlwall and Grote, in their province, have greatly increased the  fame of British scholarship; and Macaulay, brilliant and picturesque  beyond any of his contemporaries, has an unprecedented popularity, which  will last until the worthlessness of his opinions and the viciousness of  his style are more justly appreciated than they are likely to be by the  mobs of novel readers who in this generation have preferred him to James  and Ainsworth. Lord Mahon is the most legitimate successor of the greatest  historian of his country, David Hume.    Although the chief subject of these new volumes is the American war, the  general political history of England, from the decline of the fortunes of  Bute through the administration of Grenville, Rockingham, Chatham, the  Duke of Grafton, and Lord North, is illustrated and commented on as  largely as the special purpose of the author permitted; and we have many  striking passages respecting Wilkes and his various persecutions, the  Letters of Junius and their authorship, and the common intellectual and  material progress of the British empire. The spirit in which he regards  our Revolution is illustrated by the following paragraph, on the  rejection, by the House of Peers, of the conciliatory Bill by which Lord  Chatham hoped, in 1775, to prevent the threatened separation of the  colonies:          \"It may be proper, or at least pardonable, here to pause for an      inquiry, what probable issue might have attended an opposite      decision in the British Parliament? If the ministers had been      defeated on this Bill, if, in consequence, they had resigned, and      it had in other hands been carried through, would the Americans      have accepted the measure cheerfully and readily--would it for a      long time to come have closed the breach, and cemented the union      with the Mother Country? From all the facts and testimonies then      or since made public, I answer without hesitation that it would.      The sword was then slumbering in its scabbard. On both sides there      were injuries to redress, but not as yet bloodshed to avenge. It      was only a quarrel. It was not as yet a war. Even the boldest      leaders of that war in after years, whether in council or the      field, were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#9)"],[1,"long  ago, and that is simply the idea of invariable sequence. Whenever we say  that something is the cause of something else, all that we really mean  is that the latter is invariably preceded by the former, so that  whenever we find the second, which we call the effect, we may infer that  the first, which we call the cause, has gone before it. All such  inferences from effects to causes are based on experience; having  observed a certain sequence of events a certain number of times, we  conclude that the events are so conjoined that the latter cannot occur  without the previous occurrence of the former. A single case of two  events following each other could not of itself suggest that the one  event is the cause of the other, since there is no necessary link  between them in the mind; the sequence has to be repeated more or less  frequently before we infer a causal connexion between the two; and this  inference rests simply on that association of ideas which is established  in our mind by the reiterated observation of the things. Once the ideas  are by dint of repetition firmly welded together, the one by sheer force  of habit calls up the other, and we say that the two things which are  represented by those ideas stand to each other in the relation of cause  and effect. The notion of causality is in short only one particular case  of the association of ideas. Thus all reasoning as to causes implies  previous observation: we reason from the observed to the unobserved,  from the known to the unknown; and the wider the range of our  observation and knowledge, the greater the probability that our  reasoning will be correct.    [Sidenote: The savage draws his ideas of natural causation from  observation of himself. Hence he explains the phenomena of nature by  supposing that they are produced by beings like himself. These beings  may be called spirits or gods of nature to distinguish them from living  human gods.]    All this is as true of the savage as of the civilised man. He too  argues, and indeed can only argue on the basis of experience from the  known to the unknown, from the observed to the hypothetical. But the  range of his experience is comparatively narrow, and accordingly his  inferences from it often appear to civilised men, with their wider  knowledge, to be palpably false and absurd. This holds good most  obviously in regard to his observation of external nature. While he  often knows a good deal about the natural objects, whether animals,  plants, or inanimate things, on which he is immediately dependent for  his subsistence, the extent of country with which he is acquainted is  commonly but small, and he has little or no opportunity of correcting  the conclusions which he bases on his observation of it by a comparison  with other parts of the world. But if he knows little of the outer  world, he is necessarily somewhat better acquainted with his own inner  life, with his sensations and ideas, his emotions, appetites, and  desires. Accordingly it is natural enough that when he seeks to discover  the causes of events in the external world, he should, arguing from  experience, imagine that they are produced by the actions of invisible  beings like himself, who behind the veil of nature pull the strings that  set the vast machinery in motion. For example, he knows by experience  that he can make sparks fly by knocking two flints against each other;  what more natural, therefore, than that he should imagine the great  sparks which we call lightning to be made in the same way by somebody up  aloft, and that when he finds chipped flints on the ground he should  take them for thunder-stones dropped by the maker of thunder and  lightning from the clouds?[3] Thus arguing from his limited experience  primitive man creates a multitude of spirits or gods in his own likeness  to explain the succession of phenomena in nature of whose true causes he  is ignorant; in short he personifies the phenomena as powerful  anthropomorphic spirits, and believing himself to be more or less  dependent on their good will he woos their favour by prayer and  sacrifice. This personification of the various aspects of external  nature is one of the most fruitful sources of polytheism. The spirits  and gods created by this train of thought may be called spirits and gods  of nature to distinguish them from the human gods, by which I mean the  living men and women who are believed by their worshippers to be  inspired or possessed by a divine spirit.    [Sidenote: In time men reject polytheism as an explanation of natural  processes and substitute certain abstract ideas of ethers, atoms,  molecules, and so on.]    But as time goes on and men learn more about nature, they commonly  become dissatisfied with polytheism as an explanation of the world and  gradually discard it. From one department of nature after another the  gods are reluctantly or contemptuously dismissed and their provinces  committed to the care of certain abstract ideas of ethers, atoms,  molecules, and so forth, which, though just as imperceptible to human  senses as their divine predecessors, are judged by prevailing opinion to  discharge their duties with greater regularity and despatch, and are  accordingly firmly installed on the vacant thrones amid the general  applause of the more enlightened portion of mankind. Thus instead of  being peopled with a noisy bustling crowd of full-blooded and  picturesque deities, clothed in the graceful form and animated with the  warm passions of humanity, the universe outside the narrow circle of our  consciousness is now conceived as absolutely silent, colourless, and  deserted. The cheerful sounds which we hear, the bright hues which we  see, have no existence, we are told, in the external world: the voices  of friends, the harmonies of music, the chime of falling waters, the  solemn roll of ocean, the silver splendour of the moon, the golden  glories of sunset, the verdure of summer woods, and the hectic tints of  autumn--all these subsist only in our own minds, and if we imagine them  to have any reality elsewhere, we deceive ourselves. In fact the whole  external world as perceived by us is one great illusion: if we gave the  reins to fancy we might call it a mirage, a piece of witchery, conjured  up by the spells of some unknown magician to bewilder poor ignorant  humanity. Outside of ourselves there stretches away on every side an  infinitude of space without sound, without light, without colour, a  solitude traversed only in every direction by an inconceivably complex  web of silent and impersonal forces. That, if I understand it aright, is  the general conception of the world which modern science has substituted  for polytheism.    [Sidenote: But while they commonly discard the hypothesis of a deity as  an explanation of all the particular processes of nature, they retain it  as an explanation of nature in general.]    When philosophy and science by their combined efforts have ejected gods  and goddesses from all the subordinate posts of nature, it might perhaps  be expected that they would have no further occasion for the services of  a deity, and that having relieved him of all his particular functions  they would have arranged for the creation and general maintenance of the  universe without him by handing over these important offices to an  efficient staff of those ethers, atoms, corpuscles, and so forth, which  had already proved themselves so punctual in the discharge of the minor  duties entrusted to them. Nor, indeed, is this expectation altogether  disappointed. A number of atheistical philosophers have courageously  come forward and assured us that the hypothesis of a deity as the  creator and preserver of the universe is quite superfluous, and that all  things came into being or have existed from eternity without the help of  any divine spirit, and that they will continue to exist without it to  the end, if end indeed there is to be. But on the whole these daring  speculators appear to be in a minority. The general opinion of educated  people at the present day, could we ascertain it, would probably be  found to incline to the conclusion that, though every department of  nature is now worked by impersonal material forces alone, the universe  as a whole was created and is still maintained by a great supernatural  spirit whom we call God. Thus in Europe and in the countries which have  borrowed their civilisation, their philosophy, and their religion from  it, the central problem of natural theology has narrowed itself down to  the question, Is there one God or none? It is a profound question, and I  for one profess myself unable to answer it.    [Sidenote: Whether attained by inward or outward experience, the idea of  God is regularly that of a cause inferred, not perceived.]    If this brief sketch of the history of natural theology is correct, man  has by the exercise of his natural faculties alone, without the help of  revelation, attained to a knowledge or at least to a conception of God  in one of two ways, either by meditating on the operations of his own  mind, or by observing the processes of external nature: inward  experience and outward experience have conducted him by different roads  to the same goal. By whichever of them the conception has been reached,  it is regularly employed to explain the causal connexion of things,  whether the things to be explained are the ideas and emotions of man  himself or the changes in the physical world outside of him. In short, a  God is always brought in to play the part of a cause; it is the  imperious need of tracing the causes of events which has driven man to  discover or invent a deity. Now causes may be arranged in two classes  according as they are perceived or unperceived by the senses. For  example, when we see the impact of a billiard cue on a billiard ball  followed immediately by the motion of the ball, we say that the impact  is the cause"]]]
