The little people laboured hard according  to his bidding. At midnight everything was out of the hill, and John  and Elizabeth got into the silver tun and were drawn up.    It was then one o'clock, and midsummer-eve, the very time that twelve  years before John had gone down into the hill. Music sounded around  them, and they saw the glass hill open, and the rays of the light of  heaven shine on them for the first time after so many years; and when  they got out they saw the streaks of dawn already in the east. Crowds  of the underground people were around them busied about the waggons.  John bade them a last farewell, waved his brown cap three times in the  air, and then flung it among them. And at the same moment he ceased to  see them; he beheld nothing but a green hill, and the well-known  bushes and fields, and heard the church-clock of Rambin strike two.  When all was still, save a few larks who were tuning their morning  songs, they both fell on their knees and worshipped God, resolving  henceforth to lead a pious and a Christian life.    When the sun rose, John and his Elizabeth, with the children whom they  had saved from the underground people, set out for Rambin. Every  well-known object that they saw awakened pleasing recollections; and  as they passed by Rodenkirchen, John recognised, among the people  that gazed at and followed them, his old friend Klas Starkwolt, the  cowherd, and his dog Speed. It was four in the morning when they  entered Rambin, and they halted in the middle of the village, about  twenty paces from the house where John was born. The whole village  poured out to gaze on these Asiatic princes; for such the old sexton,  who had in his youth been at Moscow and Constantinople, said they  were. There John saw his father and mother, and his brother Andrew,  and his sister Trine. The old minister, Krabbe, stood there too, in  his black slippers and white nightcap, gaping and staring with the  rest.    John discovered himself to his parents, and Elizabeth to hers, and the  wedding-day was soon fixed, and such a wedding was never seen before  or since in the island of Rugen; for John sent to Stralsund and  Greifswald for whole boat-loads of wine, and sugar, and coffee, and  whole herds of oxen, sheep, and pigs. The quantity of harts and roes  and hares that were shot on the occasion it were vain to attempt to  tell, or to count the fish that were caught. There was not a musician  in Rugen and Pomerania that was not engaged, for John was immensely  rich, and he wished to display his wealth.    John did not neglect his old friend Klas Starkwolt, the cowherd. He  gave him enough to make him comfortable for the rest of his days, and  insisted on his coming and staying with him as often and as long as he  wished.    After his marriage, John made a progress through the country with his  beautiful Elizabeth and they purchased towns, and villages, and  lands, until he became master of nearly half Rugen and a very  considerable portion of the country. His father, old James Dietrich,  was made a nobleman, and his brothers and sisters gentlemen and  ladies--for what cannot money do?    John and his wife spent their days in acts of piety and charity. They  built several churches, they had the blessings of every one that knew  them, and died universally lamented. It was Count John Dietrich who  built and richly endowed the present church of Rambin. He built it on  the site of his father's house, and presented to it several of the  cups and plates made by the underground people, and his own and  Elizabeth's glass shoes, in memory of what had befallen them in their  youth. But they were all taken away in the time of the great Charles  the Twelfth of Sweden, when the Russians came on the island, and the  Cossacks plundered even the churches, and took away everything.          BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.      There was once a very rich merchant, who had six children, three boys  and three girls. As he was himself a man of great sense, he spared no  expense for their education. The three daughters were all handsome,  but particularly the youngest; indeed, she was so very beautiful, that  in her childhood every one called her the Little Beauty; and being  equally lovely when she was grown up, nobody called her by any other  name, which made her sisters very jealous of her. This youngest  daughter was not only more handsome than her sisters, but also was  better tempered. The two eldest were vain of their wealth and  position. They gave themselves a thousand airs, and refused to visit  other merchants' daughters; nor would they condescend to be seen  except with persons of quality. They went every day to balls, plays,  and public walks, and always made game of their youngest sister for  spending her time in reading or other useful employments. As it was  well known that these young ladies would have large fortunes, many  great merchants wished to get them for wives; but the two eldest  always answered, that, for their parts, they had no thoughts of  marrying any one below a duke or an earl at least. Beauty had quite as  many offers as her sisters, but she always answered, with the  greatest civility, that though she was much obliged to her lovers, she  would rather live some years longer with her father, as she thought  herself too young to marry.    It happened that, by some unlucky accident, the merchant suddenly lost  all his fortune, and had nothing left but a small cottage in the  country. Upon this he said to his daughters, while the tears ran down  his cheeks, \"My children, we must now go and dwell in the cottage, and  try to get a living by labour, for we have no other means of support.\"  The two eldest replied that they did not know how to work, and would  not leave town; for they had lovers enough who would be glad to marry  them, though they had no longer any fortune. But in this they were  mistaken; for when the lovers heard what had happened, they said, \"The  girls were so proud and ill-tempered, that all we wanted was their  fortune: we are not sorry at all to see their pride brought down: let  them show off their airs to their cows and sheep.\" But everybody  pitied poor Beauty, because she was so sweet-tempered and kind to all,  and several gentlemen offered to marry her, though she had not a  penny; but Beauty still refused, and said she could not think of  leaving her poor father in this trouble. At first Beauty could not  help sometimes crying in secret for the hardships she was now obliged  to suffer; but in a very short time she said to herself, \"All the  crying in the world will do me no good, so I will try to be happy  without a fortune.\"    When they had removed to their cottage, the merchant and his three  sons employed themselves in ploughing and sowing the fields, and  working in the garden. Beauty also did her part, for she rose by four  o'clock every morning, lighted the fires, cleaned the house, and got  ready the breakfast for the whole family. At first she found all this  very hard; but she soon grew quite used to it, and thought it no  hardship; indeed, the work greatly benefited her health. When she had  done, she used to amuse herself with reading, playing her music, or  singing while she spun. But her two sisters were at a loss what to do  to pass the time away: they had their breakfast in bed, and did not  rise till ten o'clock. Then they commonly walked out, but always found  themselves very soon tired; when they would often sit down under a  shady tree, and grieve for the loss of their carriage and fine  clothes, and say to each other, \"What a mean-spirited poor stupid  creature our young sister is, to be so content with this low way of  life!\" But their father thought differently: and loved and admired his  youngest child more than ever.    After they had lived in this manner about a year, the merchant  received a letter, which informed him that one of his richest ships,  which he thought was lost, had just come into port. This news made the  two eldest sisters almost mad with joy; for they thought they should  now leave the cottage, and have all their finery again. When they  found that their father must take a journey to the ship, the two  eldest begged he would not fail to bring them back some new gowns,  caps, rings, and all sorts of trinkets. But Beauty asked for nothing;  for she thought in herself that all the ship was worth would hardly  buy everything her sisters wished for. \"Beauty,\" said the merchant,  \"how comes it that you ask for nothing: what can I bring you, my  child?\"    \"Since you are so kind as to think of me, dear father,\" she answered,  \"I should be glad if you would bring me a rose, for we have none in  our garden.\" Now Beauty did not indeed wish for a rose, nor anything  else, but she only said this that she might not affront her sisters;  otherwise they would have said she wanted her father to praise her for  desiring nothing. The merchant took his leave of them, and set out on  his journey; but when he got to the ship, some persons went to law  with him about the cargo, and after a deal of trouble he came back to  his cottage as poor as he had left it. When he was within thirty miles  of his home, and thinking of the joy of again meeting his children, he  lost his way in the midst of a dense forest. It rained and snowed very  hard, and, besides, the wind was so high as to throw him twice from  his horse. Night came on, and he feared he should die of cold and  hunger, or be torn to pieces by the wolves that he heard howling round  him. All at once, he cast his eyes towards a long avenue, and saw at  the end a light, but it seemed a great way "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19737"],[0,"The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture, Elucidated (#9)"],[1,"sunt, et in quandam augustioris formae transierunt novitatem.

It may be said to have prevailed generally throughout the thirteenth  century[86-*].    Q. How is it distinguished from the Norman and Semi-Norman styles?    A. The semicircular-headed arch, with its peculiar mouldings, was almost  entirely discarded, and superseded by the pointed arch, with plain  chamfered edges or mouldings of a different character. The segmental arch,  nearly flat, was still however used in doorways, and occasionally the  semicircular also, as in the arches of the Retrochoir, Chichester  Cathedral.    Q. Of what three kinds were the pointed arches of this era?    A. The lancet, the equilateral, and the obtuse-angled arch.    Q. Which of these arches were most in use?    A. In large buildings the lancet and the equilateral-shaped arch were  prevalent, as appears in Westminster Abbey, where the lancet arch  predominates, and Salisbury Cathedral, where the equilateral arch is  principally used; but in small country churches the obtuse-angled arch is  most frequently found. All these arches are struck from two centres, and  are formed from segments of a circle. In large buildings the architrave  is faced with a succession of roll mouldings and deep hollows, in which  the tooth ornament is sometimes inserted. In small churches the arches,  which are double-faced, have merely plain chamfered edges.    Q. What was the difference of the piers between this and an earlier era?    A. Instead of the massive Norman, the Early English piers were, in large  buildings, composed of an insulated column surrounded by slender detached  shafts, all uniting together under one capital; these shafts were divided  into parts by horizontal bands or fillets; but in small churches a plain  octagonal pier, which can, however, scarcely be distinguished from that of  a later style, predominated.    Q. How are the capitals distinguished?    A. They are simple in comparison with those of a later style, and are  often bell-shaped, with a bead moulding round the neck, and a capping,  with a series of mouldings, above; a very elegant and beautiful capital is  frequently formed of stiffly sculptured foliage. The capital surmounting  the multangular-shaped pier is also multangular in form, but plain, with a  neck, and cap mouldings, and is difficult to be discerned from that of  the succeeding style; the cap mouldings are, however, in general not so  numerous as those of a later period.    [Illustration: Capital, Chapter House, Southwell.]    Q. How are the doorways of this style distinguished?    A. The small doorways have generally a single detached shaft on each side,  with a plain moulded bell-shaped capital, which is sometimes covered with  foliage; and the architrave mouldings consist of a few simple members,  with a hood moulding or label over, terminated by heads. We also find  richer doorways with two or more detached shafts at the sides, and  architrave mouldings composed of numerous members. Large doorways of the  Early English style were sometimes double, being divided into two arched  openings by a shaft, either single or clustered; and above this a  quatrefoil was generally inserted, but sometimes the head was filled with  sculptured detail. Examples of the double doorway occur in the cathedrals  of Ely, Chichester, Wells, Salisbury, Lincoln, and Lichfield; also at  Christchurch and St. Cross, Hants; Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire; and  in other large churches in this style.    [Illustration: Doorway, Baginton Church, Warwickshire. (13th cent.)]    Q. What kind of windows were prevalent?    [Illustration: Window, Beverley Minster. (13th cent.)]    [Illustration: St. Giles's Oxford. Ely cathedral.]    A. In the early stages of this style the lancet arch-headed window, very  long and narrow, was prevalent; frequently two, three, or more of these  were connected together by hood mouldings, the middle window rising higher  than those at the sides; sometimes they were unconnected, and without  hood mouldings. In the east wall of Early English chancels three lancet  windows, thus arranged, are frequently displayed. At a later period a  broader window, divided into two lights by a plain mullion, finished at  the top with a lozenge or circle, was used; and sometimes a window divided  into three lights, the middle one higher than the others, and comprised  under one hood moulding, was in use; windows of four and even five lancet  lights, thus disposed, are to be met with, but are not common; the sides  of the windows were in general simply splayed, without mouldings, and  increased in width inwardly, but slender shafts were sometimes annexed;  and we also find, in the interior of rich buildings of this style,  detached shafts standing out in front of the stonework forming the window  jambs, and supporting the arch of the window. Towards the close of this  style the windows assumed a more ornamental cast, and became much larger,  being frequently divided into two or four principal lights, with one or  three circles in the heads; both the lights and circles are foliated, and  these evince the transition in progress to the next, or Decorated style.  Beneath the windows a string-course is generally carried horizontally  along the wall; and a roll moulding, similar to the upper members of the  string-course of Merton College Chapel, Oxford, is most commonly met with,  as the string-course.    [Illustration: Interior of Window, St. Giles's, Oxford.]    Q. How is the buttress of this age distinguished?    A. In general by its plain triangular or pedimental head, its projecting  more from the building than the Norman buttress, and from its being less  in breadth. It is also sometimes carried up above the parapet wall. The  edges of the buttresses are sometimes chamfered; and plain buttresses in  stages finished with simple slopes are not uncommon. We very rarely find  buttresses of this style disposed at the angles of buildings, though such  disposition was common in the succeeding style; but two buttresses placed  at right angles with each other, and with the face of the wall, generally  occur at the angles of churches in this style. Flying buttresses were  sometimes used to strengthen the clerestory walls of large buildings, and  have a light and elegant effect.    [Illustration: String-Course, Merton College Chapel, Oxford.]    Q. Were the walls differently built?    A. They were not so thick as those of an earlier period, which occasioned  the want of stronger buttresses to support them.    [Illustration: Pottern, Wilts.]    [Illustration: Hartlepool, Durham.]    Q. Were the Early English roofs of a different construction from those of  a later style?    [Illustration: Groining Rib, Salisbury Cathedral.]    A. The Norman and Early English roofs were high and acutely pointed. The  original roofs of most of our old churches, from their exposure to the  weather, have long since fallen to decay, and been replaced by others of a  more obtuse shape; but in general the height and angular form of the  original roof may be ascertained by the weather moulding still remaining  on the side of the tower or steeple. The interior vaulting of stone roofs  was composed of fewer parts and ribs, which were often not more numerous  than those of Norman vaulting, and does not present that complexity of  arrangement which occurs in the vaulting-ribs of subsequent styles. In the  cathedral of Salisbury also in the nave of Wells Cathedral are simple and  good examples of Early English vaulting. A curious groined roof, in which  the ribs are of wood--plain, cut with chamfered edges--and the cells of  the vaulting are covered with boards, is to be met with in the church of  Warmington, Northamptonshire, a very rich, perfect, and interesting  specimen of this style.    Q. Was not the spire introduced at this period?    A. Yes, many spires were then built; among which was that of old St.  Paul's Cathedral, more than five hundred feet high, and which was  destroyed by fire, A. D. 1561. The spire of Oxford Cathedral is also of  this style. Early English spires are generally what are called Broach  spires, and spring at once from the external face of the walls of the  tower, without any intervening parapet.    Q. Whence did the spire take its origin?    A. It appears to have been suggested by the Norman pinnacle, which, at  first a conical capping, afterwards became polygonal, and ribbed at the  angles, thus presenting the prototype of the spire.    [Illustration]    Q. What ornament is peculiar, or nearly so, to this style?    A. That called the tooth or dog-tooth ornament, a kind of  pyramidal-shaped flower of four leaves, which is generally inserted in a  hollow moulding, and,"]]]
