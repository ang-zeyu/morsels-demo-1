As I told you, Mrs. Vernon habitually released her  for the period of these absences.\"    The notebook reappeared.    \"The young woman's address?\"    \"You can get it from the housekeeper. Is there anything else you wish to  know?\"    \"Nothing beyond that, thank you.\"    Three minutes later, Inspector Dunbar had written in his book:--Clarice  Goodstone, c/o Mrs. Herne, 134a Robert Street, Hampstead Road, N. W.    He departed from the house whereat Death the Gleaner had twice knocked  with his Scythe.          VIII    CABMAN TWO      Returning to Scotland Yard, Inspector Dunbar walked straight up to  his own room. There he found Sowerby, very red faced and humid, and a  taximan who sat stolidly surveying the Embankment from the window.    \"Hullo!\" cried Dunbar; \"he's turned up, then?\"    \"No, he hasn't,\" replied Sowerby with a mild irritation. \"But we know  where to find him, and he ought to lose his license.\"    The taximan turned hurriedly. He wore a muffler so tightly packed  between his neck and the collar of his uniform jacket, that it appeared  materially to impair his respiration. His face possessed a bluish tinge,  suggestive of asphyxia, and his watery eyes protruded remarkably; his  breathing was noisily audible.    \"No, chuck it, mister!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm only tellin' you 'cause it  ain't my line to play tricks on the police. You'll find my name in  the books downstairs more'n any other driver in London! I reckon I've  brought enough umbrellas, cameras, walkin' sticks, hopera cloaks,  watches and sicklike in 'ere, to set up a blarsted pawnbroker's!\"    \"That's all right, my lad!\" said Dunbar, holding up his hand to silence  the voluble speaker. \"There's going to be no license-losing. You did not  hear that you were wanted before?\"    The watery eyes of the cabman protruded painfully; he respired like a  horse.    \"ME, guv'nor!\" he exclaimed. \"Gor'blime! I ain't the bloke! I was  drivin' back from takin' the Honorable 'Erbert 'Arding 'ome--same as I  does almost every night, when the 'ouse is a-sittin'--when I see old Tom  Brian drawin' away from the door o' Palace Man--\"    Again Dunbar held up his hand.    \"No doubt you mean well,\" he said; \"but damme! begin at the beginning!  Who are you, and what have you come to tell us?\"    \"'Oo are I?--'Ere's 'oo I ham!\" wheezed the cabman, proffering a greasy  license. \"Richard 'Amper, number 3 Breams Mews, Dulwich Village\"...    \"That's all right,\" said Dunbar, thrusting back the proffered document;  \"and last night you had taken Mr. Harding the member of Parliament, to  his residence in?\"--    \"In Peers' Chambers, Westminister--that's it, guv'nor! Comin' back, I  'ave to pass along the north side o' the Square, an' just a'ead o' me,  I see old Tom Brian a-pullin' round the Johnny 'Orner,--'im comin' from  Palace Mansions.\"    \"Mr. Exel only mentioned seeing ONE cab,\" muttered Dunbar, glancing  keenly aside at Sowerby.    \"Wotcher say, guv'nor?\" asked the cabman.    \"I say--did you see a gentleman approaching from the corner?\" asked  Dunbar.    \"Yus,\" declared the man; \"I see 'im, but 'e 'adn't got as far as the  Johnny 'Orner. As I passed outside old Tom Brian, wot's changin' 'is  gear, I see a bloke blowin' along on the pavement--a bloke in a high  'at, an' wearin' a heye-glass.\"    \"At this time, then,\" pursued Dunbar, \"you had actually passed the other  cab, and the gentleman on the pavement had not come up with it?\"    \"'E couldn't see it, guv'nor! I'm tellin' you 'e 'adn't got to the  Johnny 'Orner!\"    \"I see,\" muttered Sowerby. \"It's possible that Mr. Exel took no notice  of the first cab--especially as it did not come out of the Square.\"    \"Wotcher say, guv'nor?\" queried the cabman again, turning his bleared  eyes upon Sergeant Sowerby.    \"He said,\" interrupted Dunbar, \"was Brian's cab empty?\"    \"'Course it was,\" rapped Mr. Hamper, \"'e 'd just dropped 'is fare at  Palace Mansions.\"...    \"How do you know?\" snapped Dunbar, suddenly, fixing his fierce eyes upon  the face of the speaker.    The cabman glared in beery truculence.    \"I got me blarsted senses, ain't I?\" he inquired. \"There's only two lots  o' flats on that side o' the Square--Palace Mansions, an' St. Andrew's  Mansions.\"    \"Well?\"    \"St. Andrew's Mansions,\" continued Hamper, \"is all away!\"    \"All away?\"    \"All away! I know, 'cause I used to have a reg'lar fare there. 'E's  in Egyp'; flat shut up. Top floor's to let. Bottom floor's two old  unmarried maiden ladies what always travels by 'bus. So does all their  blarsted friends an' relations. Where can old Tom Brian 'ave been comin'  from, if it wasn't Palace Mansions?\"    \"H'm!\" said Dunbar, \"you are a loss to the detective service, my lad!  And how do you account for the fact that Brian has not got to hear of  the inquiry?\"    Hamper bent to Dunbar and whispered, beerily, in his ear: \"P'r'aps 'e  don't want to 'ear, guv'nor!\"    \"Oh! Why not?\"    \"Well, 'e knows there's something up there!\"    \"Therefore it's his plain duty to assist the police.\"    \"Same as what I does?\" cried Hamper, raising his eyebrows. \"Course it  is! but 'ow d'you know 'e ain't been got at?\"    \"Our friend, here, evidently has one up against Mr. Tom Brian!\" muttered  Dunbar aside to Sowerby.    \"Wotcher say, guv'nor?\" inquired the cabman, looking from one to the  other.    \"I say, no doubt you can save us the trouble of looking out Brian's  license, and give us his private address?\" replied Dunbar.    \"Course I can. 'E lives hat num'er 36 Forth Street, Brixton, and 'e's  out o' the big Brixton depot.\"    \"Oh!\" said Dunbar, dryly. \"Does he owe you anything?\"    \"Wotcher say, guv'nor?\"    \"I say, it's very good of you to take all this trouble and whatever it  has cost you in time, we shall be pleased to put right.\"    Mr. Hamper spat in his right palm, and rubbed his hands together,  appreciatively.    \"Make it five bob!\" he said.    \"Wait downstairs,\" directed Dunbar, pressing a bell-push beside the  door. \"I'll get it put through for you.\"    \"Right 'o!\" rumbled the cabman, and went lurching from the room as a  constable in uniform appeared at the door. \"Good mornin', guv'nor. Good  mornin'!\"    The cabman having departed, leaving in his wake a fragrant odor of  fourpenny ale:--    \"Here you are, Sowerby!\" cried Dunbar. \"We are moving at last! This is  the address of the late Mrs. Vernon's maid. See her; feel your ground,  carefully, of course; get to know what clothes Mrs. Vernon took with her  on her periodical visits to Scotland.\"    \"What clothes?\"    \"That's the idea; it is important. I don't think the girl was in  her mistress's confidence, but I leave it to you to find out. If  circumstances point to my surmise being inaccurate--you know how to  act.\"    \"Just let me glance over your notes, bearing on the matter,\" said  Sowerby, \"and I'll be off.\"    Dunbar handed him the bulging notebook, and Sergeant Sowerby lowered his  inadequate eyebrows, thoughtfully, whilst he scanned the evidence of  Mr. Debnam. Then, returning the book to his superior, and adjusting the  peculiar bowler firmly upon his head, he set out.    Dunbar glanced through some papers--apparently reports--which lay upon  the table, penciled comments upon two of them, and then, consulting his  notebook once more in order to refresh his memory, started off for Forth  Street, Brixton.    Forth Street, Brixton, is a depressing thoroughfare. It contains small,  cheap flats, and a number of frowsy looking houses which give one the  impression of having run to seed. A hostelry of sad aspect occupies a  commanding position midway along the street, but inspires the traveler  not with cheer, but with lugubrious reflections upon the horrors of  inebriety. The odors, unpleasantly mingled, of fried bacon and paraffin  oil, are wafted to the wayfarer from the porches of these family  residences.    Number 36 proved to be such a villa, and Inspector Dunbar contemplated  it from a distance, thoughtfully. As he stood by the door of the  public house, gazing across the street, a tired looking woman, lean and  anxious-eyed, a poor, dried up bean-pod of a woman, appeared from the  door of number 36, carrying a basket. She walked along in the direction  of the neighboring highroad, and Dunbar casually followed her.    For some ten minutes he studied her activities, noting that she went  from shop to shop until her basket was laden with provisions of all  sorts. When she entered a wine-and-spirit merchant's, the detective  entered close behind her, for the place was also a post-office. Whilst  he purchased a penny stamp and fumbled in his pocket for an imaginary  letter, he observed, with interest, that the woman had purchased, and  was loading into the hospitable basket, a bottle of whisky, a bottle of  rum, and a bottle of gin.    He left the shop ahead of her, sure, now, of his ground, always provided  that the woman proved to be Mrs. Brian. Dunbar walked along Forth Street  slowly enough to enable the woman to overtake him. At the door of number  36, he glanced up at the number, questioningly, and turned in the gate  as she was about to enter.    He raised his hat.    \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mrs. Brian?\"    Momentarily, a hard look came into the tired eyes, but Dunbar's  gentleness of manner and voice, together with the kindly expression upon  his face, turned the scales favorably.    \"I am Mrs. Brian,\" she said; \"yes. Did you want to see me?\"    \"On a matter of some importance. May I come in?\"    She nodded and led the way into the house; the door was not closed.    In a living-room whereon was written a pathetic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#9)"],[1,".  There was a rivalry of leading citizens, each taking upon himself the  expense of mounting a new play, and striving to outdo the last before  him upon the list.    There were three great dramatic authors whose names have come down to  us as the Shakespeares of the Athenian drama. They were AEschylus,  Sophocles and Euripides. All were great poets, the first perhaps the  greatest. Sophocles was a fine musician and an elegant poet, and for  many years he remained the popular idol. All these men wrote not only  the words of the plays, but the music as well, every phrase of every  character having been noted for musical utterance, and all the choral  effects carefully planned. Besides this he composed what was then  called the \"Orchestic,\" whence we have our word orchestra. By  orchestic they meant an apparatus of mystical dancing or posturing and  marching and certain gestures. We do not know precisely what this  famous orchestic was, for no example of it has come down to us in  intelligible form. But from the descriptions of it by contemporary  writers, it seems to have formed the pantomimic complement of the  acting, with a certain added grace of art in grouping and posturing,  suited to attract and satisfy the eye of a public accustomed to  national games, and the beautiful conceptions of Phidias upon the  Parthenon frieze. Thus, as will be readily seen, this drama was  essentially opera. For reasons to be hereafter detailed, the music is  thought to have been of slight tonal value. This is inferred from the  compass of the instruments and the general deficiency of the Greeks  upon this side, although popular report assigns them a place entirely  different. This mystical drama, leaving so much to the imagination,  and supplementing its actual representation by the help of chorus and  a sort of sanctity derived from music, lasted but a few years. Other  causes were at work destined to bring it to a close.    Almost immediately after Euripides, appeared the great comedy writer,  Aristophanes, about 420 B.C. This great artist was not simply a  dramatist, but also a patriot and a philosopher. In several of his  plays he satirizes the classical dramas effectively, parodies their  effects, and in general pokes fun at them. He was, however, a well  accomplished musician, who might, if he had chosen, have gone on in  the steps of his predecessors. But the times were not favorable to  this. Previous to the time of Socrates, orators in addressing popular  assemblies, lawyers in pleading cases, and all public speakers, appear  to have made use of the cithara as a sort of accompaniment, if for no  other purpose than to assure themselves of securing a proper pitch of  the voice. But Socrates drew attention to verbal distinctions, made  words the image of exact concepts, and in general set in operation an  era of scientific classification and purely intellectual development,  into which music could not enter, especially in a form so poor upon  the tonal side as Greek art then was, and always remained. Then came  the great orators, of whom Demosthenes was the greatest, who seems to  have been the first to speak without musical aids; and Plato, with his  philosophy; and after him the great Aristotle, the father of  scientific classification and orderly knowledge.    To a disciple of Aristotle, Aristoxenus, we are indebted for the first  really musical work which has come down to us. It is true that the  so-called Problems of Aristotle contain many of a musical character,  showing that this great master observed tonal effects in a purely  musical spirit, but he did not make a scientific treatise upon the  art. In his Politics he has much admirable matter relating to music,  and its influence upon the feelings and its office in life has hardly  been better explained than by him. But music upon the practical side  remained a sealed book.    Among the lucid musical questions of Aristotle's Problems (which, if  not by Aristotle himself, are at least the product of his time or the  succeeding century) he refers to the phenomena of sympathetic  resonance; he asks further, why it is that when _mese_ (the keynote of  the lyre) is out of tune everything is out of tune; yet when any other  string is out of tune it affects only the particular string which is  not correctly adjusted. One of his most instructive, but also, as it  turned out, most misleading questions was why they did not magadize  (sing in) fourths and fifths as well as in octaves, since the  consonances of the fourth and the fifth are almost as well sounding as  those of the octave. This question appears to have led to the practice  of what Hucbald called \"diaphony.\" This question, it may be remarked  incidentally, is conclusive that they did _not_ use the third as a  consonance in Aristotle's time, nor sing together in fourths, fifths,  or any other intervals than the octave.    In spite of the talk about music by the Greek writers, musical theory,  in an exact form, occupies but a small place in the volume of their  works. The earliest theorist of whom we have any account was  Pythagoras, who lived about 580 B.C. He was one of the first of the  Greek wise men to avail himself of the opening of Egypt to foreigners,  which took place by Psammeticus I in the year 600 B.C. Pythagoras  lived there twenty years in connection with one of the temples, where  he seems to have gained the confidence of the priesthood and learned  much of his philosophy and so-called musical science. He defined the  mathematical relation of the octave as produced by half of a given  string, the fifth produced by two-thirds and the fourth by  three-fourths. He also found the ratio of the major step by  subtracting the fourth from the fifth. This was the ratio 9:8. With  this as a measure he attempted to place the tones of the tetrachord,  or Greek scale of four tones, which was the unit of their tonal  system. This gave him two major steps, and a half step somewhat too  small, being equal to the ratio of 256:243.    The most important part of Pythagoras' influence upon the art of music  was of a sentimental character. From Egypt he acquired many ideas of a  musical nature, such as that certain tones represented the planets,  and that time was the essence of all things. It was one of the laws of  his religion that before retiring at night his disciples should sing a  hymn in order to compose their spirits and prepare them for rest. The  verses selected for this use were probably of a devotional character,  like what are now known as the Orphic hymns, of which the lines upon  the next page may be taken as a specimen. Ambros well remarks that  such hymns could only have been sung appropriately to melodies of a  choral-like character.             \"Thou ruler of the sea, the sky, and vast abyss,       Thou who shatterest the heavens with Thy thunder peals;       Thou before whom spirits fall in awe, and gods do tremble;       Thou to whom fates belong, so wise, so unrelenting Thou;            Draw near and shine in us.\"    Various musicians and theorists later are credited with having made  additions to the musical resources of the Greeks, and it was a  proverb, said of any smart man, that he \"added a new string to the  lyre.\" This was said of Terpander especially; but it is pretty certain  that the lyre had six or seven strings some time before Terpander, and  that the form of expression was purely symbolical, as if they had said  of him \"he set the river on fire.\" The first real contributions to  musical science after the Problems of Aristotle, already cited, are  the two works of his pupil Aristoxenus--one on harmony, the other on  rhythm. These give a full account of the Greek musical systems, and  are the source of the greater part of our information upon the  subject. From them it appears that the basis of their scale was the  tetrachord of four tones, placed at an interval of two steps and a  half step. The outside tones of the tetrachord remained fixed upon the  lyre, but the two middle ones were varied for the purpose of  modulation. The Dorian tetrachord corresponded to our succession mi,  fa, sol, la; the Phrygian re, mi, fa, sol; the Lydian from do. Besides  these modes, the Greeks had what they called genera, of which there  were three--the diatonic, to which the examples already given belong;  the chromatic, in which the tetrachord had the form of mi, fa, fi, la,  the interval between the two upper tones being equal to a step and a  half; and the enharmonic, in which the first two intervals were  one-quarter of a step and the upper one a major third. We are  entirely ignorant of the practical use made of these different forms  of scale. Whether the quarter tones were used habitually, or were  glided like appoggiaturas, or passing tones, has been vigorously  maintained on both sides by different writers. The evidence seems to  point to the enharmonic as having been the most ancient, and the  chromatic and diatonic gradually superseding it. In Plato, Aristotle  and many of the Greek writers, especially in Athenaeus, much is said  about the characteristic expression of the different modes, but as  they are mutually contradictory, one saying of a given mode that it is  bold and manly, while another calls it feeble and enervating, we may  leave this for the antiquarians to settle for themselves.    After Aristotle, there were several Greek theorists who devoted  themselves to mathematical computations, the favorite problem seeming  to be to find as many ways as possible of dividing the major fourth,  or the ratio 4:3, into what they called super-particular ratios--that  is to say, a series of fractions in which each numerator differed from  the denominator by unity. They had observed that all the ratios  discovered by Pythagoras had this character, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 8/9, and  they attributed magical properties to the fact, and sought to  demonstrate the entire theory of music by the production "]]]
