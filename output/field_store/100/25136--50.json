He is indeed the spiritual conqueror of that  continent!    The Guardian was very impressed by your Assembly's recent statement  published in the January issue of \"Baha'i Quarterly\". So much so that he  felt impelled to have the American N.S.A. publish it in \"Baha'i News\" and  also have it read at the annual Convention. He feels that in excellent  form you have presented the very essence of the Baha'i attitude on these  matters. This has further strengthened his conviction that the Baha'is of  Australia and New-Zealand display a remarkable soundness in their views on  all matters concerning the Faith, a characteristic which greatly pleases  him.    Concerning your question whether a Baha'i Burial Service can be conducted  for non-Baha'is if requested by them: if non-Baha'is desire that the  believers should conduct such a service there is no objection at all.    The contemplated teaching trip of Miss Brooks, Mrs Hawthorne and Mrs  Moffit to Queensland, meets with the Guardian's whole-hearted approval. He  will pray in the Holy Shrines that its outcome will be richly blessed and  fruitful.    He was very sorry to learn that Miss Stevenson has passed on. He will pray  for her joy and advancement in the Worlds beyond. She had the great honour  and blessing of being the first New-Zealand believer and her reward must  be great.    With the assurance of Shoghi Effendi's most loving prayers for you all and  with Baha'i greetings,    Yours in His Service,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. He wishes me also to thank you for the Naw-Ruz and Ridvan greetings  from all the dear friends in Australia and New Zealand.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The community of the Most Great Name in these far-off islands have lost a  great leader, a stalwart upholder of the new World Order of Baha'u'llah.  The influence he has exercised will however continue to live, and the  example he has set will inspire the rising generation to perform deeds as  great and brilliant as those which will ever remain associated with his  name. Our dear friend, Mr. Hyde Dunn, will, from his exalted station  intercede on your behalf, and you should, on your part strive to emulate  one whom Baha'i historians will recognise and acclaim as Australia's  spiritual conqueror. I will pray for his dear spiritual children from the  depths of my heart.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.    The passing of yet another staunch and indefatigible worker, Miss  Stevenson, constitutes yet another loss to the believers in that  continent. The work which that exemplary pioneer has achieved however is  imperishable. Kindly assure her relatives of my deepfelt sympathy.    Sh.            LETTER OF JULY 30TH, 1941      July 30th, 1941    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The Guardian has instructed me to answer your welcome letter to him of  June 20th, with all its good news.    The response your teaching work met with in Brisbane is truly most  encouraging and shows a remarkable receptivity on the part of the people  of Australia to the Divine Message. Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will be  able to undertake many such trips in furtherance of the teaching work and  that an increasing number of the friends will do likewise.    Indeed all the news that comes from the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand bears witness to the soundness of their understanding of the  teachings, their loyalty and devotion to the Cause and its laws, and the  excellence of their faith itself.    The Guardian has recently written a long general letter to the Baha'is of  the West. Owing to its length and the difficulty of sending a large number  of manuscripts abroad at such a time, he has requested the N.S.A. of  America to forward it to the other National Spiritual Assemblies. He  trusts it will soon reach you.    The news received of the Winter session of the Yerrinbool school was very  encouraging. Shoghi Effendi hopes that many of these points of community  contact, such as school sessions, teaching conferences--whatever form of  activity is most feasible--will be increasingly inaugurated, as they are of  vital importance in fostering the work of the Cause.    He most deeply appreciates your own untiring services in promotion of the  Faith in all its branches. You may rest assured that he will often pray  for you, and he will also pray for the confirmation of those souls whom  you and Mrs. Hawthorne attracted during your recent trip.    With Baha'i love,    Yours in His service,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. The Guardian has not yet received the record of Martha's voice nor  photographs of Father Dunn. Will you kindly send one copy of each to him  as soon as convenient.    R. R.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    It is indeed thrilling to note the rapidity and soundness with which the  flourishing Baha'i community in that far-off land is establishing the  Faith of Baha'u'llah, is fearlessly proclaiming its truths, upholding its  verities and standards, multiplying its institutions, defending its  interests, disseminating its literature, and exemplifying its invincible  power and spirit. I rejoice, feel proud, and am eternally grateful. I  cannot but pray, with redoubled fervour, to Him Who so manifestly guides  and sustains you, to increase your numbers, to remove every barrier that  obstructs your path, to safeguard your unity, to bless your undertakings  and to enable you to demonstrate, afresh and with still greater force, the  reality of the faith that animates you in the discharge of your sacred  duties. Be assured and persevere.    Shoghi.            LETTER OF DECEMBER 26TH, 1941      Haifa, December 26th, 1941.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated Sep. 23rd. and  Oct. 1st, and to acknowledge the receipt of the manuscript you sent for  \"Baha'i World\" vol. IX, also the photographs of Father Dunn's home and his  own picture.    Regarding the questions you asked in your letter:    No. 1. Confucius was not a Prophet. It is quite correct to say he is the  founder of a moral system and a great reformer.    No. 2. The Buddha was a Manifestation of God, like Christ, but his  followers do not possess his authentic writings.    No. 3. Zoroaster was not Abraham; the Muslims, some of them, contend that  they were the same, but we believe they were two distinct Prophets. There  is a misunderstanding in the reference in \"Baha'i Proofs\" to this matter.    No. 4. There are no Prophets, so far, in the same category as Baha'u'llah,  as He culminates a great cycle begun with Adam.    No. 5. The Greatest Name is the Name of Baha'u'llah. \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha\" is  an invocation meaning: \"O Thou Glory of Glories\"! \"Allah-u-Abha\" is a  greeting which means: \"God the All-Glorious\". Both refer to Baha'u'llah.  By Greatest Name is meant that Baha'u'llah has appeared in God's Greatest  Name, in other words, that He is the Supreme Manifestation of God.    No. 6. Revelations 3.12, refers to the Revelation of Baha'u'llah.    No. 7. References in the Bible to \"Mt. Paran\" and \"Paraclete\" refer to  Muhammad's Revelation. Deuteronomy 33.2; Genesis 21.21.; Numbers 12.16;  Numbers 13.3.; Genesis 17.20 refers to the twelve Imams and in the  Revelation of St. John, Chap. 11.; where it mentions two witnesses, it  refers to Muhammad and 'Ali.    No. 8. The statement in the \"Gleanings\", p. 64-65, \"who out of utter  nothingness..\" etc., should be taken in a symbolic and not literal sense.  It is only to demonstrate the power and greatness of God.    No. 9. The Guardian considers that the gist of what Mrs. Hanford Ford  reported can be considered quite correct.    No. 10. The figures 1290 date from the declaration of Muhammad, ten years  before His flight to Medina.    No. 11. The intercalary days are specially set aside for hospitality, the  giving of gifts, etc. Baha'u'llah Himself specified that they be used this  way, but gave no explanation for it.    No. 12. The Baha'i Summer-Schools were originated in America to meet the  requirements of the friends. They have been adopted by other Baha'i  communities the world-over, but there is no reason why they should be  called \"Summer Schools\". There is nothing rigid about the term, it is  purely descriptive. The Guardian feels that although you can have the  immediate affairs of your Summer-Schools managed by a convenient local  assembly, they should remain under the direct supervision of the National  Spiritual Assembly as they are national in character and not purely local.    A few days ago Mr. Jim Heggie came to see the Guardian. He was able to  visit all the shrines and archives as well. Shoghi Effendi was delighted  with him, he found him devoted, full of faith and zeal, and very well read  in the teachings. He feels that if this is a sample of the Baha'i youth of  Australia, there is, indeed, a wonderful future ahead of that country!    He will be very pleased to receive the picture of Father Dunn's grave as  soon as it is available.    The Guardian assures you and the members of the National Spiritual  Assembly that his prayers are constantly being offered on your behalf. He  is so very pleased with the good news he receives of your activities and  the spread of the Cause in those distant lands.    Only yesterday he was reading a most heartening and enthusiastic report of  the work in Tasmania, which greatly cheered him.    Dark as these days are he feels confident that the Australian and  New-Zealand Baha'is will continue with unabated devotion to carry on their  excellent and exemplary services to the Faith.    His "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#9)"],[1,"enjoined the alteration  of the formula of the a_dh_an; of the Risaliy-i-Furu-i-'Adliyyih, rendered  into Persian by Mulla Muhammad-Taqiy-i-Harati; of the commentary on the  surih of Kaw_th_ar, which effected such a transformation in the soul of  Vahid; of the commentary on the surih of Va'l-'Asr, in the house of the  Imam-Jum'ih of Isfahan; of the dissertation on the Specific Mission of  Muhammad, written at the request of Manu_ch_ihr _Kh_an; of the second  Tablet to Muhammad _Sh_ah, craving an audience in which to set forth the  truths of the new Revelation, and dissipate his doubts; and of the Tablets  sent from the village of Siyah-Dihan to the 'ulamas of Qazvin and to Haji  Mirza Aqasi, inquiring from him as to the cause of the sudden change in  his decision.    The great bulk of the writings emanating from the Bab's prolific mind was,  however, reserved for the period of His confinement in Mah-Ku and  _Ch_ihriq. To this period must probably belong the unnumbered Epistles  which, as attested by no less an authority than Baha'u'llah, the Bab  specifically addressed to the divines of every city in Persia, as well as  to those residing in Najaf and Karbila, wherein He set forth in detail the  errors committed by each one of them. It was during His incarceration in  the fortress of Mah-Ku that He, according to the testimony of _Sh_ay_kh_  Hasan-i-Zunuzi, who transcribed during those nine months the verses  dictated by the Bab to His amanuensis, revealed no less than nine  commentaries on the whole of the Qur'an--commentaries whose fate, alas, is  unknown, and one of which, at least the Author Himself affirmed, surpassed  in some respects a book as deservedly famous as the Qayyumu'l-Asma.    Within the walls of that same fortress the Bayan (Exposition)--that  monumental repository of the laws and precepts of the new Dispensation and  the treasury enshrining most of the Bab's references and tributes to, as  well as His warning regarding, \"Him Whom God will make manifest\"--was  revealed. Peerless among the doctrinal works of the Founder of the Babi  Dispensation; consisting of nine Vahids (Unities) of nineteen chapters  each, except the last Vahid comprising only ten chapters; not to be  confounded with the smaller and less weighty Arabic Bayan, revealed during  the same period; fulfilling the Muhammadan prophecy that \"a Youth from  Bani-Ha_sh_im ... will reveal a new Book and promulgate a new Law;\" wholly  safeguarded from the interpolation and corruption which has been the fate  of so many of the Bab's lesser works, this Book, of about eight thousand  verses, occupying a pivotal position in Babi literature, should be  regarded primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than a code of  laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future  generations. This Book at once abrogated the laws and ceremonials enjoined  by the Qur'an regarding prayer, fasting, marriage, divorce and  inheritance, and upheld, in its integrity, the belief in the prophetic  mission of Muhammad, even as the Prophet of Islam before Him had annulled  the ordinances of the Gospel and yet recognized the Divine origin of the  Faith of Jesus Christ. It moreover interpreted in a masterly fashion the  meaning of certain terms frequently occurring in the sacred Books of  previous Dispensations such as Paradise, Hell, Death, Resurrection, the  Return, the Balance, the Hour, the Last Judgment, and the like. Designedly  severe in the rules and regulations it imposed, revolutionizing in the  principles it instilled, calculated to awaken from their age-long torpor  the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and fatal blow to  obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed, through its drastic  provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day, the Day when \"the Summoner  shall summon to a stern business,\" when He will \"demolish whatever hath  been before Him, even as the Apostle of God demolished the ways of those  that preceded Him.\"    It should be noted, in this connection, that in the third Vahid of this  Book there occurs a passage which, alike in its explicit reference to the  name of the Promised One, and in its anticipation of the Order which, in a  later age, was to be identified with His Revelation, deserves to rank as  one of the most significant statements recorded in any of the Bab's  writings. \"Well is it with him,\" is His prophetic announcement, \"who  fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Baha'u'llah, and rendereth thanks unto  his Lord. For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed  irrevocably ordained it in the Bayan.\" It is with that self-same Order  that the Founder of the promised Revelation, twenty years  later--incorporating that same term in His Kitab-i-Aqdas--identified the  System envisaged in that Book, affirming that \"this most great Order\" had  deranged the world's equilibrium, and revolutionized mankind's ordered  life. It is the features of that self-same Order which, at a later stage  in the evolution of the Faith, the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant and  the appointed Interpreter of His teachings, delineated through the  provisions of His Will and Testament. It is the structural basis of that  self-same Order which, in the Formative Age of that same Faith, the  stewards of that same Covenant, the elected representatives of the  world-wide Baha'i community, are now laboriously and unitedly  establishing. It is the superstructure of that self-same Order, attaining  its full stature through the emergence of the Baha'i World  Commonwealth--the Kingdom of God on earth--which the Golden Age of that same  Dispensation must, in the fullness of time, ultimately witness.    The Bab was still in Mah-Ku when He wrote the most detailed and  illuminating of His Tablets to Muhammad _Sh_ah. Prefaced by a laudatory  reference to the unity of God, to His Apostles and to the twelve Imams;  unequivocal in its assertion of the divinity of its Author and of the  supernatural powers with which His Revelation had been invested; precise  in the verses and traditions it cites in confirmation of so audacious a  claim; severe in its condemnation of some of the officials and  representatives of the _Sh_ah's administration, particularly of the  \"wicked and accursed\" Husayn _Kh_an; moving in its description of the  humiliation and hardships to which its writer had been subjected, this  historic document resembles, in many of its features, the Lawh-i-Sultan,  the Tablet addressed, under similar circumstances, from the  prison-fortress of Akka by Baha'u'llah to Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, and  constituting His lengthiest epistle to any single sovereign.    The Dala'il-i-Sab'ih (Seven Proofs), the most important of the polemical  works of the Bab, was revealed during that same period. Remarkably lucid,  admirable in its precision, original in conception, unanswerable in its  argument, this work, apart from the many and divers proofs of His mission  which it adduces, is noteworthy for the blame it assigns to the \"seven  powerful sovereigns ruling the world\" in His day, as well as for the  manner in which it stresses the responsibilities, and censures the  conduct, of the Christian divines of a former age who, had they recognized  the truth of Muhammad's mission, He contends, would have been followed by  the mass of their co-religionists.    During the Bab's confinement in the fortress of _Ch_ihriq, where He spent  almost the whole of the two remaining years of His life, the  Lawh-i-Hurufat (Tablet of the Letters) was revealed, in honor of Dayyan--a  Tablet which, however misconstrued at first as an exposition of the  science of divination, was later recognized to have unravelled, on the one  hand, the mystery of the Musta_gh_a_th_, and to have abstrusely alluded,  on the other, to the nineteen years which must needs elapse between the  Declaration of the Bab and that of Baha'u'llah. It was during these  years--years darkened throughout by the rigors of the Bab's captivity, by  the severe indignities inflicted upon Him, and by the news of the  disasters that overtook the heroes of Mazindaran and Nayriz--that He  revealed, soon after His return from Tabriz, His denunciatory Tablet to  Haji Mirza Aqasi. Couched in bold and moving language, unsparing in its  condemnation, this epistle was forwarded to the intrepid Hujjat who, as  corroborated by Baha'u'llah, delivered it to that wicked minister.    To this period of incarceration in the fortresses of Mah-Ku and  _Ch_ihriq--a period of unsurpassed fecundity, yet bitter in its  humiliations and ever-deepening sorrows--belong almost all the written  references, whether in the form of warnings, appeals or exhortations,  which the Bab, in anticipation of the approaching hour of His supreme  affliction, felt it necessary to make to the Author of a Revelation that  was soon to supersede His own. Conscious from the very beginning of His  twofold mission, as the Bearer of a wholly independent Revelation and the  Herald of One still greater than His own, He could not content Himself  with the vast number of commentaries, of prayers, of laws and ordinances,  of dissertations and epistles, of homilies and orations that had  incessantly streamed from His pen. The Greater Covenant into which, as  affirmed in His writings, God had, from time immemorial, entered, through  the Prophets of all ages, with the whole of mankind, regarding the newborn  Revelation, had already been fulfilled. It had now to be supplemented by a  Lesser Covenant which He felt bound to make with the entire body of His  followers concerning the One Whose advent He characterized as the fruit  and ultimate purpose of His Dispensation. Such a Covenant had invariably  been the feature of every previous religion. It had existed, under various  forms, with varying degrees of emphasis, had always been couched in veiled  language, and had been alluded to in cryptic prophecies, in abstruse  allegories, in unauthenticated traditions, "]]]
