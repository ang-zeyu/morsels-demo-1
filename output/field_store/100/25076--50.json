Reason protests  in vain; it cannot set a true value on things.    This arrogant power, the enemy of reason, who likes to rule and dominate  it, has established in man a second nature to show how all-powerful she  is. She makes men happy and sad, healthy and sick, rich and poor; she  compels reason to believe, doubt, and deny; she blunts the senses, or  quickens them; she has her fools and sages; and nothing vexes us more  than to see that she fills her devotees with a satisfaction far more  full and entire than does reason. Those who have a lively imagination  are a great deal more pleased with themselves than the wise can  reasonably be. They look down upon men with haughtiness; they argue with  boldness and confidence, others with fear and diffidence; and this  gaiety of countenance often gives them the advantage in the opinion of  the hearers, such favour have the imaginary wise in the eyes of judges  of like nature. Imagination cannot make fools wise; but she can make  them happy, to the envy of reason which can only make its friends  miserable; the one covers them with glory, the other with shame.    What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation, awards  respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the great? How  insufficient are all the riches of the earth without her consent!    Would you not say that this magistrate, whose venerable age commands the  respect of a whole people, is governed by pure and lofty reason, and  that he judges causes according to their true nature without considering  those mere trifles which only affect the imagination of the weak? See  him go to sermon, full of devout zeal, strengthening his reason with the  ardour of his love. He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. Let  the preacher appear, and let nature have given him a hoarse voice or a  comical cast of countenance, or let his barber have given him a bad  shave, or let by chance his dress be more dirtied than usual, then  however great the truths he announces. I wager our senator loses his  gravity.    If the greatest philosopher in the world find himself upon a plank wider  than actually necessary, but hanging over a precipice, his imagination  will prevail, though his reason convince him of his safety.[49] Many  cannot bear the thought without a cold sweat. I will not state all its  effects.    Every one knows that the sight of cats or rats, the crushing of a coal,  etc. may unhinge the reason. The tone of voice affects the wisest, and  changes the force of a discourse or a poem.    Love or hate alters the aspect of justice. How much greater confidence  has an advocate, retained with a large fee, in the justice of his cause!  How much better does his bold manner make his case appear to the judges,  deceived as they are by appearances! How ludicrous is reason, blown with  a breath in every direction!    I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who scarce waver  save under her assaults. For reason has been obliged to yield, and the  wisest reason takes as her own principles those which the imagination of  man has everywhere rashly introduced. [He who would follow reason only  would be deemed foolish by the generality of men. We must judge by the  opinion of the majority of mankind. Because it has pleased them, we must  work all day for pleasures seen to be imaginary; and after sleep has  refreshed our tired reason, we must forthwith start up and rush after  phantoms, and suffer the impressions of this mistress of the world. This  is one of the sources of error, but it is not the only one.]    Our magistrates have known well this mystery. Their red robes, the  ermine in which they wrap themselves like furry cats,[50] the courts in  which they administer justice, the _fleurs-de-lis_, and all such august  apparel were necessary; if the physicians had not their cassocks and  their mules, if the doctors had not their square caps and their robes  four times too wide, they would never have duped the world, which cannot  resist so original an appearance. If magistrates had true justice, and  if physicians had the true art of healing, they would have no occasion  for square caps; the majesty of these sciences would of itself be  venerable enough. But having only imaginary knowledge, they must employ  those silly tools that strike the imagination with which they have to  deal; and thereby in fact they inspire respect. Soldiers alone are not  disguised in this manner, because indeed their part is the most  essential; they establish themselves by force, the others by show.    Therefore our kings seek out no disguises. They do not mask themselves  in extraordinary costumes to appear such; but they are accompanied by  guards and halberdiers. Those armed and red-faced puppets who have hands  and power for them alone, those trumpets and drums which go before them,  and those legions round about them, make the stoutest tremble. They have  not dress only, they have might. A very refined reason is required to  regard as an ordinary man the Grand Turk, in his superb seraglio,  surrounded by forty thousand janissaries.    We cannot even see an advocate in his robe and with his cap on his head,  without a favourable opinion of his ability. The imagination disposes of  everything; it makes beauty, justice, and happiness, which is everything  in the world. I should much like to see an Italian work, of which I only  know the title, which alone is worth many books, _Della opinione regina  del mondo_.[51] I approve of the book without knowing it, save the evil  in it, if any. These are pretty much the effects of that deceptive  faculty, which seems to have been expressly given us to lead us into  necessary error. We have, however, many other sources of error.    Not only are old impressions capable of misleading us; the charms of  novelty have the same power. Hence arise all the disputes of men, who  taunt each other either with following the false impressions of  childhood or with running rashly after the new. Who keeps the due mean?  Let him appear and prove it. There is no principle, however natural to  us from infancy, which may not be made to pass for a false impression  either of education or of sense.    \"Because,\" say some, \"you have believed from childhood that a box was  empty when you saw nothing in it, you have believed in the possibility  of a vacuum. This is an illusion of your senses, strengthened by custom,  which science must correct.\" \"Because,\" say others, \"you have been  taught at school that there is no vacuum, you have perverted your common  sense which clearly comprehended it, and you must correct this by  returning to your first state.\" Which has deceived you, your senses or  your education?    We have another source of error in diseases.[52] They spoil the judgment  and the senses; and if the more serious produce a sensible change, I do  not doubt that slighter ills produce a proportionate impression.    Our own interest is again a marvellous instrument for nicely putting out  our eyes. The justest man in the world is not allowed to be judge in his  own cause; I know some who, in order not to fall into this self-love,  have been perfectly unjust out of opposition. The sure way of losing a  just cause has been to get it recommended to these men by their near  relatives.    Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our tools are too  blunt to touch them accurately. If they reach the point, they either  crush it, or lean all round, more on the false than on the true.    [Man is so happily formed that he has no ... good of the true, and  several excellent of the false. Let us now see how much.... But the most  powerful cause of error is the war existing between the senses and  reason.]      83    _We must thus begin the chapter on the deceptive powers._ Man is only a  subject full of error, natural and ineffaceable, without grace. Nothing  shows him the truth. Everything deceives him. These two sources of  truth, reason and the senses, besides being both wanting in sincerity,  deceive each other in turn. The senses mislead the reason with false  appearances, and receive from reason in their turn the same trickery  which they apply to her; reason has her revenge. The passions of the  soul trouble the senses, and make false impressions upon them. They  rival each other in falsehood and deception.[53]    But besides those errors which arise accidentally and through lack of  intelligence, with these heterogeneous faculties ...      84    The imagination enlarges little objects so as to fill our souls with a  fantastic estimate; and, with rash insolence, it belittles the great to  its own measure, as when talking of God.      85    Things which have most hold on us, as the concealment of our few  possessions, are often a mere nothing. It is a nothing which our  imagination magnifies into a mountain. Another turn of the imagination  would make us discover this without difficulty.      86    [My fancy makes me hate a croaker, and one who pants when eating. Fancy  has great weight. Shall we profit by it? Shall we yield to this weight  because it is natural? No, but by resisting it ...]      87    _Nae iste magno conatu magnas nugas dixerit.[54]    Quasi quidquam infelicius sit homini cui sua figmenta dominantur._[55]  (Plin.)      88    Children who are frightened at the face they have blackened are but  children. But how shall one who is so weak in his childhood become  really strong when he grows older? We only change our fancies. All that  is made perfect by progress perishes also by progress. All that has been  weak can never become absolutely strong. We say in vain, \"He has grown,  he has changed\"; he is also the same.      89    Custom is our nature. He who is accustomed to the faith believes in it,  can no longer fear hell, and believes in nothing else. He who is  accustomed to believe that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#9)"],[1,"they will not allow anything to interfere with  the crop. This done, they go to the center of the field and place a  second _tambara_, called _parobanian_, for the spirit Taragomi, who owns  all food. Leaves pleasing to him and presents of food or bracelets are  placed in it, as well as in his _tambara_ found in the house.[24] The  owner of the field takes the _malayag_, a large variety of rice, and  plants it around the _parobanian_,[25] and as the last grain is planted  the _mabalian_ again starts her prayer, this time beginning with  Taragomi. She asks for good crops, and protection for the field from all  animals, blight and drought. Finally, she begs Eugpamolak Manobo to  control the sun and winds so that they will always be favorable to the  growing grain. Having thus done all in their power to secure the  cooperation of the superior beings the men take their rice planters and  real work begins.[26] The planter (Fig. 29) consists of a long shaft at  one end of which is a metal blade while at the other is a bamboo clapper  decorated with feathers. When this instrument is struck on the ground it  digs a shallow hole an inch or more in depth, the clapper meanwhile  keeping up an incessant noise. It is said by some that the rattle is  intended to please the guardian spirit of the fields, but this does not  seem to be the prevalent idea. The women follow the men, dropping seeds  into the holes and pushing the soil over them with their feet.    [23] Eugpamolak Manobo.    [24] At Cibolan only brass objects are placed in this _tambara_.    [25] At Digos the _mabalian_ does the planting and harvesting about the  _tambara_, and the rice grown there is reserved as seed, for the next  season.    [26] FATHER GISBERT relates that it is the custom to sacrifice a slave  at this time, but this is denied by the _datu_ consulted by the writer.  See letters of FATHER GISBERT in BLAIR and ROBERTSON, The Philippine  Islands, Vol. XLIII; pp. 233-4.    FIG. 29. RICE PLANTER WITH BAMBOO CLAPPER ATTACHED TO TOP.    At nightfall of the day in which the planting has been completed a  _mabalian_ cooks fish and rice, which she carries to the _parobanian_.  Early next morning the family goes to the field and eats this offering  which \"belongs to Taragomi, so should be eaten at his house.\" From this  time until harvest the fields must be guarded against birds and animals,  but no further offerings take place unless unusual conditions should  satisfy the owner that the spirits are demanding more gifts. When  harvest time comes the owner and a few of his friends will go to the  field and pull a few of the fresh stalks, which they place in the  _pEmEg'ge_ and _parobanian_, meanwhile addressing the spirits, and the  cutting of the rice begins. This is done by women who, for this purpose,  employ a small knife called _gElat_ (Plate XXIXd). The last grain to be  cut is that about the _parobanian_. The _mabalian_ cooks a little of the  new rice in the house and places a part of it in the various _tambara_  and shrines; then, having placed a number of rice stalks on the floor,  she offers them one by one to the spirits. Not until she has finished  can any of the prepared food be eaten. The balance of the crop lies in  the sun until dry, when it is tied in bundles and placed in the granary.    When all the harvesting is finished the people will make a festival  known as _Gatokbia-an_, or _pakakaro_. Ordinarily each family will have  its own celebration, but at times all the inhabitants of a village will  join in one great celebration. The period of toil and doubt is past, the  food supply is assured, and the people gather to give thanks. No New  England Thanksgiving dinner is prepared with greater thought, or less  regard for expense, than that which is made ready at this time. The  finest of the rice, cocoanuts[sic], eggs, chickens, fish, shrimps, and  many other edibles are prepared and placed in certain dishes which are  dedicated to the spirits and are used only at this time. These plates  are arranged in a row in the center of the room and the _mabalian_  gather around them. Taking a wand of sandal wood in her hand one of the  number waves it over the offerings, while she chants long prayers.  Beginning with the most powerful, she addresses the spirits one by one,  thanking them for the care they have given to the growing grain and to  the laborers, and for the bounteous harvest. Frequently individuals will  interrupt the proceedings to place near to the _mabalian_ a fine knife  or some other prized object which they desire to have presented to the  spirits as evidence of their gratitude. At first, it is a little hard to  understand this lavishness, but it transpires that the former owners  still have possession of these objects, and that the spirits offer no  objections to their use, so long as their ownership is not disputed,  truly a case of eating the pie but still having it.    The knives and other implements which have been used in the fields are  laid on a large basket filled with rice, \"in order that they may eat,  and, therefore, have no cause to injure their owners.\" Another large  dish of rice is set aside as a special offering. In some cases this is  taken out to the fields, where it is eaten by the wife, or wives of the  host; but in Cibolan it is kept in the house until the next morning,  when it is eaten by all the members of the family. The ceremonial eating  of this rice causes the supply to last longer and assures abundant rains  for the succeeding crop. Part of the food from the dishes is placed in  the _tambara_ and shrines, and then all the guests are permitted to  feast and make merry. Unlike most Bagobo ceremonies this one lacks the  music of the _agongs_,[27] for only bamboo guitars, flutes, and the  _bolang-bolang_ are permitted at this time. The last named instrument is  made by placing a board on a rice mortar; the women gather around it  with their wooden pestles and beat a rythmical[sic] tattoo. This  concludes the festival proper, but many guests will remain for two or  three days to enjoy the hospitality of their host.    [27] Copper gongs.    On the third morning after the festival the family and some friends will  celebrate _BagkEs_ \"the tying together.\" The dishes in which food was  offered are tied together and are carried to the rice field where, with  great solemnity, the little dish in the _parobanian_ is removed and  placed among the others, while the people tell it that the other plates  have come to take it away, but that it will be returned to its home the  following year. The family goes back to the village in silence and after  tying all the dishes together place them in the rice granary.    In the Bagobo settlement at Digos, the women hold still another festival  following the cutting of the rice. This is known as _Gomeng ka  taragomi_, or _bitinbagaybe_. In the main it resembles the ceremony of  similar name, which the women of Malilla hold on the second day of  _GinEm_ (See page 111). A bamboo pole decked with leaves and green fruit  of the _areca_ palm is placed in the center of a room and is surrounded  with cooked food. After this has been offered to the spirits, it is  eaten by the guests who then indulge in dancing about the decorated  pole. This generally lasts eight days, but in one instance the  festivities continued for sixteen days and nights. The explanation given  is that \"the women wish to show Taragomi and the _Nitos_ (anitos) how  happy they are because of the good harvest, for when they see this they  will be pleased and will help again next year.\"    TRANSPORTATION AND TRADE.    The Bagobo makes no use of boats or rafts, for until recent times he has  lived at a considerable distance from the sea; and the rivers, which  flow in deep canyons, may be changed in a day from tiny streams to  rushing torrents in which no craft could keep afloat. Left to his own  devices, he pays little attention to trails, but cuts his way through  the underbrush directly to his destination. The government has forced  him to clear and maintain several fairly good roads between the larger  settlements and the coast, and these are now the highways over which he  transports his hemp and other trade articles. Quite a number of carabao  and horses are to be found in the territory, where they are used as pack  and riding animals. Both men and women are excellent riders and take  great pride in the decoration of their mounts. The saddle used is carved  from wood, in exact duplication of those used by the Spaniards. The  copper bits are also copies, but are of native casting. Strings of bells  surround the neck of a prized animal, and it is further beautified by an  artificial forelock. Rattan whips, wound with braid, and decorated with  beads, are also a part of his trappings. According to Bagobo tradition,  they have had horses from the most remote times, and Professor  BLUMENTRITT is inclined to believe that they possessed these animals  prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. In support of this contention, he  points to the fact that, unlike most Philippine tribes, they use the  Malayan name.[28]    [28] The terms used are, _bait koda_--stallion, and _mamat koda_--mare.    [Transcriber's note: The uncontracted forms of these phrases are _bayi  ta koda'_ and _mama ta koda'_. Because _bayi_ means \"female\" and _mama_  means \"male,\" the definitions of \"stallion\" and \"mare\" appear to have  been interchanged in error.]    Heavy loads of field products are transported on animals, or are carried  in cylindrical bark or rattan boxes or carrying frames (Fig. 30). Such a  receptacle is supported on the back by means of a band which passes  around the forehead, or by other bands which slip over the shoulders.  Both sexes carry loads in this way, although it must be confessed that  consideration for the members of the gentler sex has not reached such a  stage that they are relieved of any great part of such labor."]]]
