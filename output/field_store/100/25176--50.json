This, however, is certain that,  throughout the East, altars, statues, and pillars were erected for  superstitious purposes upon mountains and other high places.    Herodotus informs us that the ancient Egyptians were the first people  who gave names to their gods. Of Osiris, Isis, and the many other gods  and sacred animals that were worshipped in Egypt, we shall say little  at this part of our subject. The bull, it is well known, was one of  the most sacred animals. The priests affirmed that Apis was of divine  origin, the cow that produced him having been impregnated with holy  fire. Dogs, the Egyptians said, deserved homage because they guided  Isis when she searched for the body of Osiris. She, it may be  remembered, sought for the precious remains with true pertinacity till  she found them. To accomplish her purpose, she found it necessary to  transform herself into a swallow, to dry up the river Ph[oe]drus, and  to kill with her glances the eldest son of a king. Her tears were  supposed to cause the inundation of the Nile. At times she had the  head of a cow, which identified her with the cow of whom the sun was  born. The hawk was deified because one of these birds brought to the  priests of Thebes a book, tied round with a scarlet thread, containing  the rites and ceremonies to be observed in the worship of the gods.  The wolf was adored because Osiris arose in the shape of that animal  from the infernal regions, and assisted Isis and her son Horus to  battle against Typhon. The cat was revered as an emblem of the moon,  for its various spots, fruitfulness, and activity in the night. The  goat (which, by the by, is said to be absent from the earth and  present with Satan a part of every twenty-four hours of the day, and  can never be seen from sunrise to sunrise without being lost sight of  for a longer or shorter time) was honoured as the representation of  manhood in full vigour, and was worshipped, from gratitude to the  gods, for multiplying the people of the country. The crocodile was  also advanced to the dignity of a god. If one killed any of the sacred  animals designedly, he was put to death,--if involuntarily, his  punishment was referred to the priests; but if a man killed a hawk, a  cat, or an ibis, whether designedly or not, he died without mercy.  During a severe famine, when the Egyptians became cannibals, not one  of them was known to have tasted the sacred animals.    All revered animals were kept at great expense, and when they died  costly funerals took place. When the Apis died at Memphis, in the  reign of Ptolemy the son of Lagus, his funeral cost not less than  L13,000 sterling. When a cat died, the family it belonged to expressed  great grief, and prayed and fasted several days. In cases of fire,  more care was taken to preserve the feline animals than the most  valuable property in the house. Dead cats, which were almost  invariably embalmed, were sometimes carried from remote parts to be  interred in the city of Bubastis, and hawks and moles were buried with  great solemnity at Butos, even though they should have died in foreign  countries. Juvenal mentions that leeks and onions were objects of  worship, and others say that the lotus was also sacred in various  parts of the East. The priests were both physicians and interpreters  of oracles; they carefully observed the phenomena of nature, and  registered every uncommon occurrence. From such observations, they  calculated the results of other events of similar nature. Hence arose  the practice of divination, and afterwards that of dispensing oracles.  Oracles were erected in every part of Egypt. Even the sacred animals  had their several oracles. The Apis was consulted by observing into  which of his chambers he entered. By a certain principle understood,  the omen was regarded as foretelling good or evil.    The barbarous custom of sacrificing human victims was long in force in  Egypt, and prevailed down to the reign of Amasis, by whom it was  abolished. Not to give too severe a shock to the superstitious  feelings of the people, wax figures, representing human beings, were  permitted to be substituted for the living mortals. These customs  were, no doubt, what sorcerers and witches imitated at their midnight  feasts in after ages, and which led old women to imagine that, by  making wax images of those whom they intended to injure, and sticking  sharp instruments into them at one time, and at another time exposing  them to a scorching heat before a fire, they would wreak their  vengeance upon the individuals whom the figures represented. We have  it from more than one learned writer, that the cruel and gloomy  worship of Egypt arose from a belief that Typhon was labouring  incessantly to counteract the happiness of mankind. He was considered  to be greedy and voracious, and that it was necessary to glut his  altars with blood in order to appease his anger.    Magic was a science in which the Egyptians excelled. Its attainment  was esteemed the highest exertion of human intellect. Some imagined  that the invention of magic exceeded human invention, and they  pretended that the angel who fell in love with the antediluvian women  taught it, and that the principles thereof were preserved by Ham after  the Deluge, and that he communicated them to his son Mizraim; but  others ascribed the invention to Hermes. Without either admitting or  denying these assertions, we can have no hesitation in stating that  much of our superstition may be traced back to Egyptian religion and  customs, and that the singular belief of the Egyptians was general,  and long anterior to the time Jacob and his sons went down to that  country.    The Egyptian priests, taking advantage of the people's credulity,  taught that the sun, moon, and whole host of heaven were endowed with  intelligence, and exerted an influence over the destinies of men; and  they (the priests) pretended to work miracles, and obtain oracles and  omens. They also laid claim to the power of interpreting dreams.    The Egyptians believed that the souls of men went into other bodies at  death,--such as had been virtuous going into exalted bodies, but the  vicious passing into mean reptiles and other contemptible creatures.  After remaining in a state of punishment for a certain number of  years, they were supposed to pass into more exalted beings. Praise was  not bestowed indiscriminately upon every person who died, however  exalted his position. Characters were given by judges, after inquiry  into the life and conduct of the deceased. The judges sat on the  opposite side of a lake; and while they crossed the lake, he who sat  at the helm was called Charon, which gave rise to the fable among the  Greeks, that Charon conducted the souls of deceased persons into the  infernal regions.

The great city of Babylon owed its origin to the ambition of the proud  people who built the tower of Babel. In course of time Babylon rose to  great grandeur, but superstition became so prevalent that it proved a  snare to the inhabitants. Like the heathen around, they worshipped  fire and images. The Babylonians pretended to great skill in  astrology, soothsaying, and magic. The Chaldeans, so called in a  strict sense, were a society of pretenders to learning, priests,  philosophers, astrologers, and soothsayers, who, it is said, dwelt in  a region by themselves, and the rest of the people were called  Babylonians. While Babylon was in its glory, prophets predicted that  dreadful judgments would befall it. And so it happened. On the very  night the destruction came, the king, alarmed by the mysterious  handwriting on the wall, consulted his magicians; and Daniel, who had  been made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and  soothsayers, made known the sad end of Belshazzar and his kingdom.    The Medes and Persians worshipped the sun, fire, water, the earth, the  winds, and deities without number. Human sacrifices, as in other  idolatrous countries, were offered by them, and they burned their  children in fiery furnaces appropriated to their idols. At first the  gods they worshipped were Arimanius, the god of evil, and Oromasdes,  the giver of all good. Plutarch says that Oromasdes created several  inferior gods or genii, and that Arimanius created many devils. The  former also created twenty-four devils, and enclosed them in an egg;  but the latter broke the egg, and by that means let out the demons,  and created a mixture of good and evil. The religion of the Persians  underwent a variety of revolutions. Temples were built for the worship  of fire, prior to which Magian priests kept the sacred fire burning on  mountain tops under considerable difficulties. They fed it with wood  stripped of the bark; they were prohibited from blowing the fire with  their breath or with bellows, lest it should be polluted. Had one done  either, he would have been punished with death. The Jews had the real  fire from heaven, and the Magi pretended to have received theirs from  the upper regions likewise.    The Gaures held that the earth was inhabited at first by two persons.  "]]]
