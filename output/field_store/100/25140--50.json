Go you great Bear--how dare you abuse my Relations--    SIR PETER. Now may all the Plagues of marriage be doubled on me, if ever  I try to be Friends with you any more----    LADY TEAZLE. So much the Better.    SIR PETER. No--no Madam 'tis evident you never cared a pin for me--I was  a madman to marry you--    LADY TEAZLE. And I am sure I was a Fooll to marry you--an old dangling  Batchelor, who was single of [at] fifty--only because He never could  meet with any one who would have him.    SIR PETER. Aye--aye--Madam--but you were pleased enough to listen to  me--you never had such an offer before--    LADY TEAZLE. No--didn't I refuse Sir Jeremy Terrier--who everybody  said would have been a better Match--for his estate is just as good as  yours--and he has broke his Neck since we have been married!    SIR PETER. I have done with you Madam! You are an  unfeeling--ungrateful--but there's an end of everything--I believe you  capable of anything that's bad--Yes, Madam--I now believe the Reports  relative to you and Charles--Madam--yes--Madam--you and Charles are--not  without grounds----    LADY TEAZLE. Take--care Sir Peter--you had better not insinuate any such  thing! I'll not be suspected without cause I promise you----    SIR PETER. Very--well--Madam--very well! a separate maintenance--as soon  as you Please. Yes Madam or a Divorce--I'll make an example of myself  for the Benefit of all old Batchelors--Let us separate, Madam.    LADY TEAZLE. Agreed--agreed--and now--my dear Sir Peter we are of a  mind again, we may be the happiest couple--and never differ again, you  know--ha! ha!--Well you are going to be in a Passion I see--and I shall  only interrupt you--so, bye! bye! hey--young Jockey try'd and countered.         [Exit.]    SIR PETER. Plagues and tortures! She pretends to keep her temper, can't  I make her angry neither! O! I am the miserable fellow! But I'll not  bear her presuming to keep her Temper--No she may break my Heart--but  she shan't keep her Temper.         [Exit.]          SCENE II.--At CHARLES's House         Enter TRIP, MOSES, and SIR OLIVER    TRIP. Here Master Moses--if you'll stay a moment--I'll try whether  Mr.----what's the Gentleman's Name?    SIR OLIVER. Mr.----Moses--what IS my name----    MOSES. Mr. Premium----    TRIP. Premium--very well.         [Exit TRIP--taking snuff.]    SIR OLIVER. To judge by the Servants--one wouldn't believe the master  was ruin'd--but what--sure this was my Brother's House----    MOSES. Yes Sir Mr. Charles bought it of Mr. Joseph with the Furniture,  Pictures, &c.--just as the old Gentleman left it--Sir Peter thought it a  great piece of extravagance in him.    SIR OLIVER. In my mind the other's economy in selling it to him was more  reprehensible by half.----         Enter TRIP    TRIP. My Master[,] Gentlemen[,] says you must wait, he has company, and  can't speak with you yet.    SIR OLIVER. If he knew who it was wanted to see him, perhaps he wouldn't  have sent such a Message.    TRIP. Yes--yes--Sir--He knows you are here--I didn't forget little  Premium--no--no----    SIR OLIVER. Very well--and pray Sir what may be your Name?    TRIP. Trip Sir--my Name is Trip, at your Service.    SIR OLIVER. Well then Mr. Trip--I presume your master is seldom without  company----    TRIP. Very seldom Sir--the world says ill-natured things of him but 'tis  all malice--no man was ever better beloved--Sir he seldom sits down to  dinner without a dozen particular Friends----    SIR OLIVER. He's very happy indeed--you have a pleasant sort of Place  here I guess?    TRIP. Why yes--here are three or four of us pass our time agreeably  enough--but then our wages are sometimes a little in arrear--and not  very great either--but fifty Pounds a year and find our own Bags and  Bouquets----    SIR OLIVER. Bags and Bouquets!--Halters and Bastinadoes! [Aside.]    TRIP. But a propos Moses--have you been able to get me that little Bill  discounted?    SIR OLIVER. Wants to raise money too!--mercy on me! has his distresses,  I warrant[,] like a Lord--and affects Creditors and Duns! [Aside.]    MOSES. 'Twas not be done, indeed----    TRIP. Good lack--you surprise me--My Friend Brush has indorsed it and  I thought when he put his name at the Back of a Bill 'twas as good as  cash.    MOSES. No 'twouldn't do.    TRIP. A small sum--but twenty Pound--harkee, Moses do you think you  could get it me by way of annuity?    SIR OLIVER. An annuity! ha! ha! a Footman raise money by annuity--Well  done Luxury egad! [Aside.]    MOSES. Who would you get to join with you?    TRIP. You know my Lord Applice--you have seen him however----    MOSES. Yes----    TRIP. You must have observed what an appearance he makes--nobody dresses  better, nobody throws off faster--very well this Gentleman will stand my  security.    MOSES. Well--but you must insure your Place.    TRIP. O with all my Heart--I'll insure my Place, and my Life too, if you  please.    SIR OLIVER. It's more than I would your neck----    MOSES. But is there nothing you could deposit?    TRIP. Why nothing capital of my master's wardrobe has drop'd lately--but  I could give you a mortgage on some of his winter Cloaths with equity  of redemption before November or--you shall have the reversion--of the  French velvet, or a post obit on the Blue and Silver--these I  should think Moses--with a few Pair of Point Ruffles as a collateral  security--hey, my little Fellow?    MOSES. Well well--we'll talk presently--we detain the Gentlemen----    SIR OLIVER. O pray don't let me interrupt Mr. Trip's Negotiation.    TRIP. Harkee--I heard the Bell--I believe, Gentlemen I can now introduce  you--don't forget the annuity little Moses.    SIR OLIVER. If the man be a shadow of his Master this is the Temple of  Dissipation indeed!         [Exeunt.]          SCENE III.--CHARLES, CARELESS, etc., etc.         At Table with Wine    CHARLES. 'Fore Heaven, 'tis true!--there is the great Degeneracy of the  age--many of our acquaintance have Taste--Spirit, and Politeness--but  plague on't they won't drink----    CARELESS. It is so indeed--Charles--they give into all the substantial  Luxuries of the Table--and abstain from nothing but wine and wit--Oh,  certainly society suffers by it intolerably--for now instead of the  social spirit of Raillery that used to mantle over a glass of bright  Burgundy their conversation is become just like the Spa water they  drink which has all the Pertness and flatulence of champaine without its  spirit or Flavour.    FIRST GENTLEMAN. But what are they to do who love Play better than  wine----    CARELESS. True--there's Harry diets himself--for gaming and is now under  a hazard Regimen.    CHARLES. Then He'll have the worst of it--what you wouldn't train a  horse for the course by keeping him from corn--For my Part egad I am  never so successful as when I'm a little--merry--let me throw on a  Bottle of Champaine and I never lose--at least I never feel my losses  which is exactly the same thing.    SECOND GENTLEMAN. Aye that may be--but it is as impossible to follow  wine and play as to unite Love and Politics.    CHARLES. Pshaw--you may do both--Caesar made Love and Laws in a  Breath--and was liked by the Senate as well as the Ladies--but no man  can pretend to be a Believer in Love, who is an abjurer of wine--'tis  the Test by which a Lover knows his own Heart--fill a dozen Bumpers to a  dozen Beauties, and she that floats atop is the maid that has bewitched  you.    CARELESS. Now then Charles--be honest and give us yours----    CHARLES. Why I have withheld her only in compassion to you--if I toast  her you should give a round of her Peers, which is impossible! on earth!    CARELESS. O, then we'll find some canonized Vestals or heathen Goddesses  that will do I warrant----    CHARLES. Here then--Bumpers--you Rogues--Bumpers! Maria--Maria----    FIRST GENTLEMAN. Maria who?    CHARLES. Oh, damn the Surname 'tis too formal to be register'd in  Love's calendar--but now Careless beware--beware--we must have Beauty's  superlative.    FIRST GENTLEMAN. Nay Never study[,] Careless--we'll stand to the  Toast--tho' your mistress should want an eye--and you know you have a  song will excuse you----    CARELESS. Egad so I have--and I'll give him the song instead of the  Lady.----         SONG.--AND CHORUS--<4>         Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen;          Here's to the widow of fifty;       Here's to the flaunting extravagant quean,          And here's to the housewife that's thrifty.       Chorus.  Let the toast pass,--                    Drink to the lass,       I'll warrant she'll prove an excuse for a glass.         Here's to the charmer whose dimples we prize;          Now to the maid who has none, sir;       Here's to the girl with a pair of blue eyes,          And here's to the nymph with but one, sir.       Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.         Here's to the maid with a bosom of snow:          Now to her that's as brown as a berry:       Here's to the wife with a face full of woe,          And now to the damsel that's merry.       Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.         For let 'em be clumsy, or let 'em be slim,          Young or ancient, I care not a feather;       So fill a pint bumper quite up to the brim,       So fill up your glasses, nay, fill to the brim,          And let us e'en toast them together.       Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.         [Enter TRIP whispers CHARLES]    SECOND GENTLEMAN. Bravo Careless--Ther's Toast and Sentiment too.    FIRST GENTLEMAN. E' faith there's infinite charity in that song.----    CHARLES. Gentlemen, you must excuse me a little.--Careless, take the  Chair, will you?    CARELESS. Nay prithee, Charles--what now--this is one of your Peerless  Beauties I suppose--has dropped in by chance?    CHARLES. No--Faith--to tell you the Truth 'tis a Jew and a Broker who  are come by appointment.    CARELESS.

O Lord! I am single, alone and lowly. For me there is no support save  Thee, no helper except Thee and no sustainer beside Thee. Confirm me in  Thy service, assist me with the cohorts of Thine angels, make me  victorious in the promotion of Thy Word and suffer me to speak out Thy  wisdom amongst Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the helper of the weak and  the defender of the little ones, and verily Thou art the Powerful, the  Mighty and the Unconstrained.            13: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF CANADA AND GREENLAND      _Revealed on February 21, 1917, in Baha'u'llah's room at the house of  Abbud in Akka, and addressed to the Baha'is of Canada--Newfoundland, Prince  Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,  Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Mackenzie, Keewatin, Ungava,  Franklin Islands--and Greenland. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye kind friends and the maidservants of the Merciful:    2 In the great Qur'an, God says: \"Thou shalt see no difference in the  creatures of God.\"(20) In other words, He says: From the ideal standpoint,  there is no variation between the creatures of God, because they are all  created by Him. From the above premise, a conclusion is drawn, that there  is no difference between countries. The future of the Dominion of Canada,  however, is very great, and the events connected with it infinitely  glorious. It shall become the object of the glance of providence, and  shall show forth the bounties of the All-Glorious.    3 'Abdu'l-Baha during his journey and sojourn through that Dominion  obtained the utmost joy. Before My departure, many souls warned Me not to  travel to Montreal, saying, the majority of the inhabitants are Catholics,  and are in the utmost fanaticism, that they are submerged in the sea of  imitations, that they have not the capability to hearken to the call of  the Kingdom of God, that the veil of bigotry has so covered the eyes that  they have deprived themselves from beholding the signs of the Most Great  Guidance, and that the dogmas have taken possession of the hearts  entirely, leaving no trace of reality. They asserted that should the Sun  of Reality shine with perfect splendor throughout that Dominion, the dark,  impenetrable clouds of superstitions have so enveloped the horizon that it  would be utterly impossible for anyone to behold its rays.    4 But these stories did not have any effect on the resolution of  'Abdu'l-Baha. He, trusting in God, turned his face toward Montreal. When  he entered that city he observed all the doors open, he found the hearts  in the utmost receptivity and the ideal power of the Kingdom of God  removing every obstacle and obstruction. In the churches and meetings of  that Dominion he called men to the Kingdom of God with the utmost joy, and  scattered such seeds which will be irrigated with the hand of divine  power. Undoubtedly those seeds will grow, becoming green and verdant, and  many rich harvests will be gathered. In the promotion of the divine  principles he found no antagonist and no adversary. The believers he met  in that city were in the utmost spirituality, and attracted with the  fragrances of God. He found that through the effort of the maidservant of  God Mrs. Maxwell a number of the sons and daughters of the Kingdom in that  Dominion were gathered together and associated with each other, increasing  this joyous exhilaration day by day. The time of sojourn was limited to a  number of days, but the results in the future are inexhaustible. When a  farmer comes into the possession of a virgin soil, in a short time he will  bring under cultivation a large field. Therefore I hope that in the future  Montreal may become so stirred, that the melody of the Kingdom may travel  to all parts of the world from that Dominion and the breaths of the Holy  Spirit may spread from that center to the East and the West of America.    5 O ye believers of God! Be not concerned with the smallness of your  numbers, neither be oppressed by the multitude of an unbelieving world.  Five grains of wheat will be endued with heavenly blessing, whereas a  thousand tons of tares will yield no results or effect. One fruitful tree  will be conducive to the life of society, whereas a thousand forests of  wild trees offer no fruits. The plain is covered with pebbles, but  precious stones are rare. One pearl is better than a thousand wildernesses  of sand, especially this pearl of great price, which is endowed with  divine blessing. Erelong thousands of other pearls will be born from it.  When that pearl associates and becomes the intimate of the pebbles, they  also all change into pearls.    6 Again I repeat that the future of Canada, whether from a material or a  spiritual standpoint, is very great. Day by day civilization and freedom  shall increase. The clouds of the Kingdom will water the seeds of guidance  which have been sown there. Consequently, rest ye not, seek ye no  composure, attach not yourselves to the luxuries of this ephemeral world,  free yourselves from every attachment, and strive with heart and soul to  become fully established in the Kingdom of God. Gain ye the heavenly  treasures. Day by day become ye more illumined. Draw ye nearer and nearer  unto the threshold of oneness. Become ye the manifestors of spiritual  favors and the dawning-places of infinite lights! If it is possible, send  ye teachers to other portions of Canada; likewise, dispatch ye teachers to  Greenland and the home of the Eskimos.    7 As regards the teachers, they must completely divest themselves from the  old garments and be invested with a new garment. According to the  statement of Christ, they must attain to the station of rebirth--that is,  whereas in the first instance they were born from the womb of the mother,  this time they must be born from the womb of the world of nature. Just as  they are now totally unaware of the experiences of the fetal world, they  must also forget entirely the defects of the world of nature. They must be  baptized with the water of life, the fire of the love of God and the  breaths of the Holy Spirit; be satisfied with little food, but take a  large portion from the heavenly table. They must disengage themselves from  temptation and covetousness, and be filled with the spirit. Through the  effect of their pure breath, they must change the stone into the brilliant  ruby and the shell into pearl. Like unto the cloud of vernal shower, they  must transform the black soil into the rose garden and orchard. They must  make the blind seeing, the deaf hearing, the extinguished one enkindled  and set aglow, and the dead quickened.    8 Upon you be greeting and praise!    PRAISE be to Thee, O my God! These are Thy servants who are attracted by  the fragrances of Thy mercifulness, are enkindled by the fire burning in  the tree of Thy singleness, and whose eyes are brightened by beholding the  splendors of the light shining in the Sinai of Thy oneness.    O Lord! Loose their tongues to make mention of Thee amongst Thy people,  suffer them to speak forth Thy praise through Thy grace and  loving-kindness, assist them with the cohorts of Thine angels, strengthen  their loins in Thy service, and make them the signs of Thy guidance  amongst Thy creatures.    Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving,  the All-Merciful.    The spreaders of the fragrances of God should recite this prayer every  morning:    O GOD, my God! Thou beholdest this weak one begging for celestial  strength, this poor one craving Thy heavenly treasures, this thirsty one  longing for the fountain of eternal life, this afflicted one yearning for  Thy promised healing through Thy boundless mercy which Thou hast destined  for Thy chosen servants in Thy kingdom on high.    O Lord! I have no helper save Thee, no shelter besides Thee, and no  sustainer except Thee. Assist me with Thine angels to diffuse Thy holy  fragrances and to spread abroad Thy teachings amongst the choicest of Thy  people.    O my Lord! Suffer me to be detached from aught else save Thee, to hold  fast to the hem of Thy bounty, to be wholly devoted to Thy Faith, to  remain fast and firm in Thy love and to observe what Thou hast prescribed  in Thy Book.    Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.            14: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA      _Revealed on March 8, 1917, in the summerhouse (Isma'il Aqa's room) at  'Abdu'l-Baha's house in Haifa, and addressed to the Baha'is of the United  States and Canada. _    1                                   _He is God!_             O ye heavenly souls, sons and daughters of the Kingdom:    2 God says in the Qur'an: \"Take ye hold of the Cord of God, all of you,  and become ye not disunited.\"(21)    3 In the contingent world there are many collective centers which are  conducive to association and unity between the children of men. For  example, patriotism is a collective center; nationalism is a collective  center; identity of interests is a collective center; political alliance  is a collective center; the union of ideals is a collective center, and  the prosperity of the world of humanity is dependent upon the organization  and promotion of the collective centers. Nevertheless, all the above  institutions are, in reality, the matter and not the substance, accidental  and not eternal--temporary and not everlasting. With the appearance of  great revolutions and upheavals, all these collective centers are swept  away. But the Collective Center of the Kingdom, embodying the institutions  and divine teachings, is the eternal Collective Center.
