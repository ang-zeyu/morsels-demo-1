Should the price of wool  rise in the near future the change that has been suggested might be  checked, but it has received such an impetus that the Navaho will always  henceforth pay much more attention to horticulture than they have in the  past, and this means necessarily a modification in the present methods  of house building. The average Navaho farm, and almost every adult male  now has a small garden patch, comprises less than half an acre, while  two acres is considered a large area to be worked by one family at one  time.    One result of this industrial development of the people is an increased  permanency of dwellings. As the flocks of sheep and goats diminish and  their care becomes less important, greater attention is paid to the  selection of sites for homes, and they are often located now with  reference to a permanent occupancy and with regard to the convenience of  the fields, which in some cases furnish the main source of subsistence  of the family. As a collateral result of these conditions and tendencies  an effort is now sometimes made to build houses on the American plan;  that is, to imitate the houses of the whites. Such houses are a wide  departure from the original ideas of house structures of the Navaho.  They are rectangular in plan, sometimes with a board roof, and  occasionally comprise several rooms. When the local conditions favor it  they are constructed of stone, regular walls of masonry; but perhaps the  greater number of those now in existence are in the mountain districts,  and were built of logs, often hewn square before being laid in place.  Plate LXXXVIII shows a stone house belonging to one of the wealthiest  men in the tribe, Bitcai by name. It is situated on the western slope of  the Tunicha mountains and was built some years ago, but it is a type of  house which is becoming more and more frequent on the reservation. There  is practically nothing aboriginal about it except a part of its interior  furniture and its inhabitants, and the only one of the old requirements  that has been met is the fronting of the house to the east, while the  character of the site and the natural conditions demand a western front.    The log houses referred to are constructed much like the stone house  shown in the illustration, except that they are built usually by Indian  labor and ordinarily are covered with flat earthen roofs. Frequently the  logs are hewn square before being placed in the walls, which present  a very neat and finished appearance. Sometimes door and window frames  are procured from the sawmill or from the traders, and add to such  appearance, while nearly always one or more glazed sashes occupy the  window openings and board doors close the entrances. In nearly all cases  the requirement that the entrance should face the east is observed, but  it is being more and more ignored, and in the houses constructed within  the last few years the ancient custom is frequently violated. Unless the  principal entrance were made to face the east, the performers in the  dedicatory ceremonies could not take their prescribed positions and the  ceremony would have to be either modified or omitted altogether.      CEREMONIES OF DEDICATION    Among the Pueblo Indians there are certain rituals and ceremonial  observances connected with the construction of the houses, but in the  Navaho system nothing of a ceremonial nature is introduced until the  conclusion of the manual labor. Usually there are enough volunteers to  finish the work in one day, and by evening everything is ready for the  dedication. The wife sweeps out the house with a wisp of grass and she  or her husband makes a fire on the floor directly under the smoke hole.  She then goes to her bundles of household effects, which are still  outside, and pours a quantity of white cornmeal into a shallow  saucer-shape basket. She hands this to the _qasci[ng]_, or head of the  family, who enters the hogan and rubs a handful of the dry meal on the  five principal timbers which form the _tsaci_ or frame, beginning with  the south doorway timber. He rubs the meal only on one place, as high up  as he can reach easily, and then does the same successively on the south  timber, the west timber, the north timber, and the north doorway timber.  While making these gifts, as the proceeding is termed, the man preserves  a strict silence, and then, as with a sweeping motion of his hand from  left to right (_cab[)i]kego_, as the sun travels) he sprinkles the meal  around the outer circumference of the floor, he says in low measured  tones--      _Qojonli_             _co[.g]an_    May it be delightful  my house;      _C[)i]ts[)i]'dje_   _qojonli_    From my head        may it be delightful;      _C[)i]kece_    _qojonli_    To my feet     may it be delightful;      _Ciyace_      _qojonli_    Where I lie   may it be delightful;      _C[)i]kig[)i] caltso_   _qojonli_    All above me            may it be delightful;      _C[)i]na caltso_  _qojonli_    All around me     may it be delightful.    He then flings a little of the meal into the fire, saying--      _Qojonli hoce_                  _c[)i]ko[ng]_    May it he delightful and well,  my fire.    and tosses a handful or two up through the smoke hole, saying--      _Qojonli_             _Tci[ng]hanoai_     _c[)i]ca nai[)i]cni'_    May it be delightful  Sun (day carrier),  my mother's ancestor,                                                    for this gift;      _Qojonli_             _nacale_          _co[.g]an_    May it be delightful  as I walk around  my house.    Then two or three handfuls of meal are sprinkled out of the doorway  while he says--      _Qojonli_             _ca[)e]'cin_            _c[)i]ca_    May it be delightful  this road of light,     my mother's ancestor.    The woman then makes an offering to the fire by throwing a few small  handfuls of meal upon it, and as she sprinkles it she says in a subdued  voice--      _Qojonli_             _c[)i]ko[ng]_    May it be delightful  my fire;      _Qojonli_             _caltcini_        _caltso yahoce_    May it be delightful  for my children;  may all be well;      _Qojonli_             _cibeacan_                _caltso yahoce_    May it be delightful  with my food and theirs;  may all be well;      _caltso c[)i]nalgeya_    _yahoce colel'_    All my possessions well  may they be made                               (that is, may they be made to increase);      _caltso c[)i]l'i[ng]_  _yahoce colel'_    All my flocks          well may they be made (to increase).    When a hogan is built for a woman who has no husband, or if the husband  is absent at the time, the wife performs all these ceremonies. In the  absence of white cornmeal, yellow cornmeal is sometimes used, but never  the _cqac[)i]ci[ng] cocl[)i]'j_, the sacred blue pollen of certain  flowers, which is reserved exclusively for the rites of the shaman.    By the time these forms have been observed night will have fallen.  During the day, while the house building was in progress, the women were  busily engaged in preparing food; all now gather inside the hogan, a  blanket is suspended over the door frame, all the possessions of the  family are bought in, sheepskins are spread on the floor, the fire is  brightened and the men all squat around it. The women bring in food in  earthen cooking pots and basins, and, having set them down among the  men, they huddle together by themselves to enjoy the occasion as  spectators. Every one helps himself from the pots by dipping in with  his fingers, the meat is broken into pieces, and the bones are gnawed  upon and sociably passed from hand to hand. When the feast is finished  tobacco and corn husks are produced, cigarettes are made, everyone  smokes, and convivial gossipy talk prevails. This continues for two or  three hours, when the people who live near by get up their horses and  ride home. Those from a long distance either find places to sleep in the  hogan or wrap themselves in their blankets and sleep at the foot of a  tree. This ceremony is known as the _qo[.g]an aiila_, a kind of  salutation to the house.    But the _qo[.g]an b[)i]g[)i]'n_, the house devotions, have not yet  been observed. Occasionally these take place as soon as the house is  finished, but usually there is an interval of several days to permit the  house builders to invite all their friends and to provide the necessary  food for their entertainment. Although analogous to the Anglo-Saxon  \"house warming,\" the _qo[.g]an b[)i]g[)i]'n_, besides being a  merrymaking for the young people, has a much more solemn significance  for the elders. If it be not observed soon after the house is built bad  dreams will plague the dwellers therein, toothache (dreaded for mystic  reasons) will torture them, and the evil influence from the north will  cause them all kinds of bodily ill; the flocks will dwindle, ill luck  will come, ghosts will haunt the place, and the house will become  _bats[)i]c_, tabooed.    A few days after the house is finished an arrangement is made with some  shaman (_qacal'i_, devotional singer) to come and sing the ceremonial  house songs. For this service he always receives a fee from those who  engage him, perhaps a few sheep or their value, sometimes three or four  horses or their equivalent, according to the circumstances of the house  builders. The social gathering at the _qo[.g]an b[)i]g[)i]'n_ is much  the same as that of the _qo[.g]an aiila_, when the house is built,  except that more people are usually invited to the former. They feast  and smoke, interchange scandal, and talk of other topics of interest,  for some hours. Presently the _qacal'i_ seats himself under the main  west timber so as to face the east, and the singing begins.    In this ceremony no rattle is used. The songs are begun by the shaman  in a drawling tone and all the men join in."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18222"],[0,"The Religion of Numa (#9)"],[1,"in Rome, centuries later, she was artificially identified  with Artemis. In the earliest times there were two places in Italy where  the cult of Diana was especially prominent, both, as we should expect,  in wooded mountainous regions: one on Mount Tifata (near Capua), the  modern St. Angelo in Formis; the other in Latium, in a grove near  Aricia. It is with this latter cult-centre that we have here to do. The  grove near Aricia became so famous that the goddess worshipped there was  known as \"Diana of the Grove\" (Diana Nemorensis), and the place where  she was worshipped was called the \"Grove\" (_nemus_), a name which is  still retained in the modern \"Nemi.\" She was a goddess of the woods, of  the animal kingdom, of birth, and so of women; and almost all the  dedicatory inscriptions which have been found near her shrine were put  up by women. She was worshipped above all by the people of Aricia, and  she seems to have been the patron deity of the town. When it fell to  Aricia's lot to become the head of the league, her goddess Diana  promptly assumed an important position in the league, not because she  had by nature any political bearing whatsoever, but merely because she  was wedded to Aricia, and experienced all the vicissitudes of her  career. Thus there came into the league, alongside of the old Juppiter  Latiaris of the Alban Mount, the new Diana Nemorensis of Aricia, and  sacrifices to her formed a part of the solemn ritual of the united towns  of Latium. It does not take actually a great many years for a religious  custom to acquire sanctity, and before many generations had passed,  Diana was felt to be quite as original and essential a part of the  worship of the league as Juppiter himself. During these same centuries  Rome was growing in importance and influence in the league, until,  instead of being one of its insignificant towns, she was in a fair way  to become its president. Here her diplomacy stepped in to help her. The  league was of course essentially a political institution, but in a  primitive society political institutions are still in tutelage to  religious ones, and the direct road to strong political influence lies  through religious zeal. The way to leadership in the Latin league lay  through excessive devotion to Juppiter and Diana. It is therefore no  accidental coincidence that we find Rome in the period of Servius  building a temple to Juppiter Latiaris on the top of the Alban Mount,  and introducing the worship of Diana into Rome, building her a temple on  the Aventine, hence outside the _pomerium_. Yet it was not the  introduction of her worship as an ordinary state-cult, for then she  would have been taken inside the _pomerium_ with far greater right than  Hercules and Castor were. It was, on the contrary, the building of a  sanctuary of the league outside the _pomerium_, yet inside the civil  wall; not the adoption of Diana as a Roman goddess, but the close  association of the Diana of the Latin league with Rome. It was the  attempt to put Rome religiously as well as politically into the position  which Aricia held; and it was successful. Diana was still the  league-goddess; tradition has it that the league helped to build the  temple; and the dedication day of the temple, August 13, was the same as  that of the temple at Nemi. The Roman temple was outside the _pomerium_  therefore, not because she was a foreign goddess like Minerva, but  because as a league-goddess she must be outside, not inside, the sacred  wall of Rome.    Diana had been introduced for a specific purpose as part of a diplomatic  game, not because Rome felt any real religious need of her; it is hardly  to be expected therefore that her subsequent career in Rome would be of  any great importance. Naturally when once the state had taken the  responsibility of the cult upon itself, that cult was assured as long as  pagan Rome lasted, for the state was always faithful, at least in the  mechanical performance of a ritual act; but popular interest could not  be counted on, especially as many of the things which Diana stood for,  for example her relation to women, were ably represented by Juno. It is  not likely that Diana would ever have been of importance in the religion  of subsequent time, had it not been for another accident which served to  keep alive the interest in Diana, just as the accident of Diana's  connection with the Latin league had aroused that interest in the  beginning. This was the coming of Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo  came first, probably during the time of Servius, but Artemis seems to  have come much later, not before B.C. 431. Her identification with Diana  was inevitable, and from that time onward Diana begins a new life with  all the attributes and myths of Artemis, but this new Artemis-Diana was  quite as different a goddess from the old Aventine Diana as the new  Athena-Minerva was from the old Aventine Minerva.    The political interest of the Romans had been aroused, they had found  their life-work, their career was opening before them, and it must not  be supposed that the reflex action of this new political spirit on the  religious world was confined to the building of two league temples, one  to Juppiter Latiaris on the Alban Mount, miles away from Rome, and one  to Diana outside the _pomerium_ over in the woods of the Aventine. This  political interest was no artificial acquisition, but the inevitable  expression of an instinct. It must therefore find its representation  inside the city, in connexion with a deity who was already deep in the  hearts of the people. This deity could be none other than the sky-father  Juppiter, who had stood by them in the old days of their exclusively  farming life, sending them sunshine and rain in due season. Up on the  Capitoline he was worshipped as _Feretrius_, \"the striker,\" in his most  fearful attribute as the god of the lightning. To him the richest spoils  of war (_spolia opima_) were due, and to him the conqueror gave thanks  on his return from battle. It was this Juppiter of the Capitoline who  was chosen to be the divine representative of Rome's political ambition;  and her confidence in the future, and the omen of her inevitable success  lay in the cult-names, the _cognomina_, with which this Juppiter was  henceforth and forever adorned, Juppiter Optimus Maximus. These  adjectives are no mere idle ornament, no purely pleasant phraseology;  they express not merely the excellence of Rome's Juppiter but his  absolute superiority to all other Juppiters, including Juppiter  Latiaris. And so while Rome with one hand was building a temple for the  league on the Alban Mount, merely as a member of the league, with the  other hand she was building a temple in the heart of her city to a god  who was to bring into subjection to himself all other gods who dared to  challenge his supremacy, just as the city which paid him honour was to  overcome all other cities which refused to acknowledge her. From  henceforth Juppiter Optimus Maximus represents all that is most truly  Roman in Rome. It was under his banner that her battles were fought, it  was to him in all time to come that returning generals gave thanks.    Tradition sets the completion of the Capitoline temple in the first year  of the republic, but the idea and the actual beginning of the work  belong to the later kingdom and hence to our present period, and the  contemplation of it forms a fitting close to the development which we  have tried to sketch. And now that this part of our work is over it may  be well to ask ourselves what we have seen, for there have been so many  bypaths which we have of necessity explored, that the main road we have  travelled may not be entirely distinct in our mind. In the period which  corresponds to the later kingdom, and roughly to the sixth century  before Christ, and which we have called \"Servian\" for convenience, we  have watched a primitive pastoral community, isolated from the world's  life, turning into a small city-state with political interests, the  beginnings of trade and handicraft, and various rival social classes;  and we have seen how along with the coming of these outside interests  there came various new cults connected with them, most of them implying  entirely new deities, and only one or two of them new sides of old  deities. The body of old Roman religion had received its first blows;  what Tacitus (_Hist._ i. 4) says of the downfall of the empire--\"Then  was that secret of the empire disclosed, that it was possible for a  ruler to be appointed elsewhere than at Rome\"--is true of Roman religion  in this period when it was discovered that the state might take into  itself deities from outside Rome. And yet while the principle itself was  fatal, the practice of it, so far, had been without much harm. Rome's  growth was inevitable, it was quite as inevitable that these new  interests should be represented in the world of the gods; her old gods  did not suffice, hence new ones were introduced. But the actual gods  brought in thus far were harmless; Hercules, Castor, Minerva, Diana  never did Rome any injury in themselves, never injured her national  _morale_, never lowered the tone of earnest sobriety which had been  characteristic of the old regime.    So far it was good, and well had it been for Rome if she could have shut  the gate of her Olympus now. What the old religion had not provided was  now present. Politics, trade, and art were now represented. With these  she was abundantly supplied for all her future career. But that was not  to be, the gate was still open, and the destructive influence of Greece  was soon to send in a host of new deities, who were destined not only to  overwhelm the old Roman gods--which in itself we might forgive--but to  sap away the old Roman virtues, to the maintenance of which the  atmosphere of these old gods was essential. The forerunner of this  influence was in himself innocent enough,"]]]
