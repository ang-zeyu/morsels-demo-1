So farewell,  brothers, and let us meet here in a year's time.\"    \"God bless us all,\" Janko called out, \"and grant that one of us may find  our dear father's Magic Grape-Vine.\"    The two older brothers of course met in a short time when their roads  joined and they had a good laugh to think how they had outwitted the  Booby.    \"Time enough to look for that old Grape-Vine when we've had a little  fun!\" the eldest said. \"Let us sit down here and eat a bite and then  push on to the next village. There's an inn there where we can try our  luck at cards.\"    So they sat down by the roadside, opened their wallets, and laid out  some bread and cheese. Just then a Little Lame Fox came limping up on  three feet, and whimpering and fawning it begged for something to eat.    \"Get out!\" bawled the older brother and the second, picking up a handful  of stones, threw them at the Fox.    The little animal shied and then came timidly back, again begging for  something to eat.    \"Let's kill it!\" cried one of the brothers.    They both jumped up and tried to strike the little creature with their  sticks. The Fox limped off and they followed, hitting at it as they ran  and always just missing it. It was so weak and lame that they expected  every minute to overtake it and so kept on chasing it until it had led  them pretty far into the woods. Then suddenly it disappeared and there  was nothing left for the brothers to do but make their way back to the  roadside grumbling and cursing. In their absence some shepherd dogs had  found their open wallets and eaten all their food. So now they really  had something to curse about.    Janko meanwhile had been trudging along steadily on the third road. At  last when he began to feel hungry, he sat down by the wayside and opened  his wallet. Instantly the same Little Lame Fox came limping up and  whimpered and fawned and begged for something to eat.    \"You poor little creature,\" Janko said, \"are you hungry?\"    He held out his hand coaxingly and the animal gave it a timid sniff.    \"Of course I'll give you something to eat,\" Janko said. \"There's enough  for both of us.\"    With that he divided his bread and cheese and gave the Little Fox half.  Then they ate together and the Little Fox allowed Janko to pat her head.    When they finished eating the Fox sat up on her haunches and said:    \"Now, Janko, tell me about yourself. Who are you and where are you  going?\"    The Fox seemed such a sensible little person that it didn't surprise  Janko in the least to have her sit up and talk. Janko's brothers would  have said that he hadn't sense enough to be surprised. But he had a good  heart, Janko had, and as you'll soon hear a good heart is a much better  guide for conduct than wicked brains.    Janko answered the Fox simply and truthfully. He told about his father  and his two brothers and about his father's weeping eye and the Magic  Grape-Vine for which he and his brothers were gone in search.    \"You've been good to me,\" the Little Fox said. \"You've shared your bread  with me and that makes us friends. So from now on if you'll be a brother  to me, I'll be a little sister to you.\"    Goodness knows Janko's own brothers weren't very good to him, but Janko  understood what the Little Fox meant and he agreed.    \"Well then, brother,\" the Fox said, \"I know where that Grape-Vine is and  I'm going to help you to get it. If you do just as I say I don't believe  you'll have any trouble. Now take hold of my tail and away we'll go.\"    So Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and sure enough away they  went. Whether they sailed through the air or just ran fleetly along the  ground I don't know. But I do know that they went a great distance and  that when they stopped Janko didn't feel in the least tired or  breathless.    \"Now, my brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"listen carefully to what I tell  you. The king of this country has a wonderful garden. In the midst of it  your father's Grape-Vine is planted. We are close to the garden now. It  is protected by twelve watches each of which is composed of twelve  guards. To get to the Grape-Vine you will have to pass them all. Now as  you approach each watch look carefully. If the eyes of all the guards  are open and staring straight at you, have no fear. They sleep with  their eyes open and they won't see you. But if their eyes are closed,  then be careful for when their eyes are closed they are awake and ready  to see you. You will find the Grape-Vine in the very center of the  garden. Standing near it you will see two spades, a wooden spade and a  golden spade. Take the wooden spade and dig up the Vine as quickly as  you can. Under no condition touch the golden spade. Now, Janko, do you  understand?\"    Yes, Janko thought he understood. He slipped into the garden and the  first thing he saw were twelve fierce looking guards who were staring at  him with great round eyes. He was much frightened until he remembered  that the Little Fox had said that if their eyes were open they were fast  asleep. So he picked up courage and walked straight by them and sure  enough they didn't see him. He passed watch after watch in the same way  and at last reached the center of the garden. He saw the Grape-Vine at  once. There was no mistaking it for at that very moment it was pouring  out wine of itself into a golden bucket. Near it were two spades, Janko  in great excitement snatched up the first that came to his hand and  began to dig. Alas, it was the golden spade and as Janko drove it into  the earth it sent out a loud ringing sound that instantly woke the  guards. They came running from all directions with their eyes tightly  closed for now, of course, they were awake. They caught Janko and  dragged him to the king to whom they said:    \"A thief! A thief! We found him trying to steal your Magic Grape-Vine!\"    \"My Magic Grape-Vine!\" thundered the king. \"Young man, what do you mean  trying to steal my Magic Grape-Vine?\"    \"Well, you see,\" Janko answered simply, \"the Grape-Vine really belongs  to my father. It was stolen from him years ago and ever since then his  left eye has wept over the loss of it. Give me the Vine, O king, for if  you don't I shall have to come back and try again to steal it for it  belongs to my father and I have sworn to get it!\"    The king frowned in thought and at last he said:    \"I can't give away my precious Grape-Vine for nothing, young man, but I  tell you what I'll do: I'll give it to you provided you get for me the  Golden Apple-Tree that bears buds, blossoms, and golden fruit every  twenty-four hours.\"    With that Janko was dismissed and turned out of the garden.    The Little Fox was waiting for him and Janko had the shame of confessing  that he had forgotten the warning about the golden spade and had been  caught.    \"But the king says he will give me the Grape-Vine provided I get for him  the Golden Apple-Tree that bears buds, blossoms, and golden fruit every  twenty-four hours.\"    \"Well, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"you were good to me, so I'll help  you again. Take hold of my tail and away we'll go.\"    Janko took hold of the Little Fox's tail and away they went a greater  distance than before. In spite of going so quickly it took them a long  time but whether it was weeks or months I don't know. Whichever it was  when they stopped Janko didn't feel in the least tired or breathless.    \"Now, brother,\" the Little Fox said, \"here we are in another country  close to the king's garden where the Golden Apple-Tree grows. To reach  it you will have to pass twenty-four watches of twelve guards each.  Take care that you pass each guard as before when his eyes are wide open  and staring straight at you for that means he is asleep. When you reach  the Golden Apple-Tree you will see two long poles on the ground--a  wooden pole and a golden pole. Take the wooden pole and beat down some  of the golden fruit. Don't touch the golden pole. Remember!\"    So Janko crept into the second garden and succeeded in passing all the  guards of the twenty-four watches when their eyes were wide open and  staring straight at him. He reached the Golden Apple-Tree and saw at  once the two long poles that were lying near it on the ground. Now  whether because he was excited or because he forgot what the Fox  said--he had a good heart, Janko had, but he was a little careless  sometimes--I don't know. But I do know that instead of taking the wooden  pole as the Fox had told him, he took the golden pole. At the first  stroke of the golden pole against the golden branches of the tree, the  golden branches sent out a loud clear whistle that woke all the sleeping  guards. Every last one of them came running to the Apple-Tree and in no  time at all they had captured poor Janko and carried him to their  master, the king.    \"Trying to steal my Golden Apple-Tree, is he?\" roared the king in a  great rage. \"What do you want with my Golden Apple-Tree, young man?\"    \"Well, you see,\" Janko answered simply, \"I have to have the Golden  Apple-Tree to exchange it for the Magic Grape-Vine that really belongs  to my father. It was stolen from him years ago and ever since then his  left eye has wept over the loss of it. Give me the Golden Apple-Tree, O  king, for if you don't I shall have to come back and try again to steal  it.\"    The king seemed impressed with Janko's words for after a moment he said:    \"Janko, I can't give you the Golden Apple-Tree for nothing, but I tell  you what I'll do: I'll let you have it provided you get for me the  Golden Horse that can race around the world in twenty-four hours.\"    With that Janko was dismissed and turned out of the garden.    As usual the Little Fox was waiting for him and again Janko had the  shame of confessing that he had forgotten the warning about the golden  pole and had been caught.    \"But the king says he will give me the Golden Apple-Tree provided I get  him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#9)"],[1," you, but I hear that you have been utilizing your  time well.    \"Remember that your sword is to be used against the enemies of the  country, only,\" and nodding, he walked on.    The Princess Amelia was the centre of a group of ladies. She was a  charming princess, but at times her face bore an expression of deep  melancholy; and all knew that she had never ceased to mourn the  fate of the man she would have chosen, Baron Trench, who had been  thrown into prison by her angry father, for his insolence in  aspiring to his daughter's hand.    \"You must be glad that your hard work is over, Drummond,\" Lindsay  said, as they stood together watching the scene.    \"I am glad that the drill is over,\" Fergus replied, \"but I should  have liked my work with the professor to have gone on for another  six months.\"    \"Ah, well! You will have opportunities to take it up again, when we  return, after thrashing the Austrians.\"    \"How long will that be, Lindsay?\"    The latter shrugged his shoulders.    \"Six months or six years; who can tell?\" he said. \"If it be true  that Russia and France, to say nothing of Saxony, are with her, it  is more likely to be years than months, and we may both come out  colonels by the time it is over.\"    \"That is, if we come out at all,\" Fergus said, with a smile at the  other's confidence.    \"Oh! Of course, there is that contingency, but it is one never  worth reckoning with. At any rate, it is pretty certain that, if we  do fall, it will be with odds against us; but of course, as  aides-de-camp our chance is a good deal better than that of  regimental officers.    \"At any rate, you have had good preparation for the campaign, for  your work will be child's play in comparison to what you have been  going through. How you stood it, I cannot make out. I worked pretty  hard when I first arrived; but the drill for the first six months  was tremendous, and I used to be glad to crawl into bed, as soon as  I had had my supper.    \"Well, you have been a poor companion so far, Drummond.\"    \"I am afraid I have been, but will try and make up for it, in the  future.    \"I suppose there is no doubt that we shall march, in the first  place, on Dresden.\"    \"I think that there is no doubt of that. There is no Saxon army to  speak of, certainly nothing that can offer any serious opposition.  From there there are three or four passes by which we could pour  into Bohemia. Saxony is a rich country, too, and will afford us a  fine base for supplies, as we move on. I suppose the Austrians will  collect an army to oppose us, in Bohemia. When we have thrashed  them, I expect we shall go on straight to Vienna.\"    Fergus laughed.    \"It all sounds easy enough, Lindsay. I only hope that it will come  off just as you prophesy.\"    \"That is one advantage of fighting in a foreign service, Fergus.  One fights just as stoutly for victory as if one were fighting for  home, but if one is beaten it does not affect one so much. It is  sad to see the country overrun, and pillaged; but the houses are  not the houses of our own people, the people massacred are not  one's own relations and friends. One's military vanity may be hurt  by defeat; otherwise, one can bear it philosophically.\"    \"I never looked at it in that light before, Lindsay, but no doubt  there is a great deal in what you say. If my father had fallen on a  German battlefield, instead of at Culloden, our estates would not  have been confiscated, our glens harried, and our clansmen hunted  down and massacred. No, I see there is a great difference. I  suppose I should fight just as hard, against the Austrians, as I  should have done against the English at Culloden, had I been there;  but defeat would have none of the same consequences. No, putting it  as you do, I must own that there is a distinct advantage in foreign  service, that I never appreciated before.    \"But I see people are leaving, and I am not sorry. As we are going  to be up before daybreak, the sooner one turns in the better.\"    Karl had received the order to call his master at three, to have  breakfast ready at half past, and the horses at the door at four,  with somewhat less than his usual stolidity.    \"You will have harder work in the future, Karl,\" Fergus said.    \"I shall be glad of it, sir. Never have I had such a lazy time as I  have had for the last month. The first three or four days were very  pleasant; then I began to think that I should like a little to do,  so as to remind me that there was such a thing as work. But the  last fortnight has been terrible. A man cannot sleep for  twenty-four hours, and if it had not been that Donald and I have  had an occasional quarrel, as to our respective regiments and over  the native land he is so fond of bragging about, I should have been  ready to hang myself.    \"Ah, sir, how often have I to thank my stars that I did not take my  discharge!--which I could have asked for, as I have served my time.  I had thought of it, many times; and had said to myself how  delightful it would be to hear the morning call sound, at a  barracks near, and to turn over in my bed and go to sleep again; to  have no guard to keep, no sergeant to bully or provost guard to  arrest one, if one has taken a cup too much. This fortnight has  shown me the folly of such ideas. It has taught me when I am well  off, and what misery it is to be one's own master, and to be always  wondering how the day is to be got through.\"    \"Well, you are not likely to have to complain that you have nothing  to do, for some time now, Karl.\"    \"No, cornet. I have felt a new man, since I heard the great news.  There is always plenty to do, on a campaign. There are the horses  to be cleaned, food to be cooked, forage and rations to be fetched.  Then, too, on a campaign every one is merry and good tempered, and  one sings as one marches and sits round the campfire. One may be  cold and wet and hungry, but who cares? One swears at the moment,  but one laughs again, as soon as the sun shines.\"    \"Well, Karl, you had best turn in at once, for at three o'clock we  shall want to be called.\"    \"You can rely upon my waking, sir. Does my officer wish to take a  full-dress suit with him?\"    \"No; the order is that all are to start in marching order, and that  all baggage is to be cut down to the smallest proportions. No  officer is to take more than can be carried in his valises.\"    It was the first week in August when the three columns, each twenty  thousand strong, moved from their respective starting points.  Although the king was nominally in command of the central division,  Marshal Keith was the real commander. He rode with the king at the  head of the column, and his aides-de-camp, and those of Frederick,  were constantly on their way up and down the line, carrying orders  and bringing in reports as to the manner in which the regiments  maintained their respective positions, and especially how the  artillery and baggage train kept up.    There was no necessity, at present, for taking precautions. The  march would for some days lead through Prussia, and it was morally  certain that the Saxon army--which was small and scattered and,  even if united, would not equal the strength of one of the Prussian  armies--would not attempt any serious resistance; for the country  was flat, and there would be no defiles where a small force of men  could successfully oppose a larger one. Nevertheless, the daily  marches were long for the infantry and the baggage, but by no means  fatiguing for mounted men. The staff and aides-de-camp, with their  orderlies, rode behind the leaders. The troopers were sometimes  employed, instead of the officers, when a short written order had  to be sent back to the rear of the column.    The harvest having been gathered in, the cavalry rode across the  open country, thus reducing the length of the column. The day was  very hot, and the infantry opened their ranks, as much as possible,  to allow the passage of what little air was moving. At nine o'clock  the troops were halted. Each man had been served with a breakfast,  before starting; and the haversacks were now opened, and a meal  made of the bread they contained, washed down with an allowance of  rough wine, carried in each regimental waggon. Then the men sat  down, under the shade of greatcoats supported by ramrods and other  contrivances, and either slept or talked until half-past two; when  the bugle sounded. The greatcoats were rolled up and strapped on to  the knapsacks, then there was a vigorous use of the brush, to  remove the thick dust gathered on the march. At three the column  got into motion again, and halted for the night at half-past six;  when fires were lighted, coppers put on, and the main meal of the  day presently served.    The rations of the officers were the same as those of the men, but  the greater part of them supplemented the food by that carried in  their orderlies' saddlebags. Lindsay, Fergus, and the marshals  other two aides-de-camp had arranged that, when possible, they  should mess together; and their servants should prepare the meal by  turns, while those not so engaged looked after the horses, saw that  they were fed, watered, and groomed. The servants were all old  campaigners, and though neither Lindsay nor Fergus had thought of  giving them orders to that effect, both Donald and Karl had laid in  a stock of provisions.    Donald had cooked a pair of fowls on the previous evening. Karl had  bought a sucking pig. One of the German officer's servants had a  huge piece of salt beef, that had already been boiled, while the  other had a hare. It was agreed at once that the fowls should be  left for early breakfast; and the beef put aside for dinner, and  for supper, also, if nothing else could be obtained. Karl, as the  servant of the junior officer, was cook for the evening, and he  acquitted himself admirably.    Each officer carried in his saddlebag a tin plate, a drinking horn,  and a"]]]
