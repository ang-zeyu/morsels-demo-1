[1608]    A little exporting was immediately begun. So early as May 20, 1608,  Jamestown sent to England a ship laden with iron ore, sassafras, cedar  posts, and walnut boards. Another followed on June 2d, with a cargo all  of cedar wood. This year or the next, small quantities of pitch, tar,  and glass were sent. From 1619 tobacco was so common as to be the  currency. About 1650 it was largely exported, a million and a half  pounds, on the average, yearly. The figure had risen to twelve million  pounds by 1670. At the middle of the century, corn, wheat, rice, hemp,  flax, and fifteen varieties of fruit, as well as excellent wine were  produced. A wind-mill was set up about 1620, the first in America. It  stood at Falling Creek on the James River. The pioneer iron works on the  continent were in this colony, hailing from about the date last named.  Community of property prevailed at Jamestown in all the earliest years,  as it did at Plymouth. After the event noted by John Rolfe: \"about the  last of August [1619] came in a Dutch man of warre that sold us twenty  Negars,\" slavery was a continual and increasing curse, as is attested  by the laws concerning slaves. It encouraged indolence and savagery of  habit and nature. Virginian slaves, however, were better treated than  those farther south. They were tolerably clothed, fed, and housed.    [Illustration: Tobacco Plant.]    [Illustration: Captain John Smith.]    There was in Virginia little of that healthful social and political  contact which did so much to develop civilization at the North. Of town  life there was practically nothing. Even so late as 1716 Jamestown had  only a sorry half-dozen structures, two of which were church and  court-house. Fifteen years later Fredericksburg had, besides the manor  house of Colonel Willis and its belongings, only a store, a tailor shop,  a blacksmith shop, a tavern or \"ordinary,\" and a coffeehouse. Richmond  and Petersburg still existed only on paper, and if we come down to the  middle of the eighteenth century, Williamsburg, the capital of the  province, was nothing but a straggling village of two hundred houses,  without a single paved street. Only the College and the governor's  \"palace\" were of brick. The county-seats were mostly mere glades in the  woods, containing each its court-house, prison, whipping-post, pillory,  and ducking-stool, besides the wretched tavern where court and  attendants put up, and possibly a church. Hardships and dissensions  marked the whole early history of this infant state. At one time only  forty settlers remained alive, at another meal and water were the sole  diet. Hoping for instant riches in gold, poor gentlemen and vagabonds  had come, too much to the exclusion of mechanics and laborers. For  relief from the turbulence and external dangers of this period, the  colony owed much to Captain John Smith, who, after all allowance for his  boasting, certainly displayed great courage and energy in emergencies.  He, too, it was who did most to explore the country up the James and  upon Chesapeake Bay.    [Illustration: \"King Powhatan commands C:Smith to be flayne his daughter  Pokahontas beggs his life his thankfullness and how he subiecled 39 of  their kings reade ye history\" Pocahontas saving Captain Smith's  Life. From Smith's \"General History.\"]    [1609-1610]    A new charter was granted in 1609, the council in England being now  appointed by the stockholders instead of the king, and the governor of  the colony being named by this council. Lord Delaware was made Governor  and Captain-General of Virginia, and many more colonists sent out. By a  wreck of two of the vessels there was delay in the arrival of the newly  chosen officers. Smith, then Percy, meantime continued to exercise  authority. This, again, was a critical period. Indians were troublesome.  Tillage having been neglected from the first, provisions became  exhausted, and a crisis long referred to as \"the starving time\" ensued.  The colony had actually abandoned Jamestown and shipped for England,  when met in James River by Lord Delaware, coming with relief. They at  once returned, and an era of hope dawned. This was in June, 1610. One  hundred and fifty new settlers accompanied Delaware. Planting was  vigorously prosecuted, the Indians placated, and still further  accessions of people and cattle secured from England.    [1612]    Delaware's brief, mild sway was always a benediction, in pleasing  contrast with the severities of Dale and Argall, who successively  governed after his departure. Under Dale, death was the penalty for  slaughtering cattle, even one's own, except with the Governor's leave,  also of exporting goods without permission. A baker giving short weight  was to lose his ears, and on second repetition to suffer death. A  laundress purloining linen was to be flogged. Martial law alone  prevailed; even capital punishment was ordained without jury. Such  arbitrary rule was perhaps necessary, so lawless were the mass of the  population. It at any rate had the excellent effect of rousing the  Virginians to political thought and to the assertion of their rights. In  1612 a change took place in the Company's methods of governing its  colony. The superior council was abolished, its authority transferred to  the corporation as a whole, which met as an assembly to elect officers  and enact laws for the colony. The government thus became more  democratic in form and spirit.    [Illustration: \"POWHATAN Held this state & fashion when Capt.' Smith was  delivered to him prisoner. 1607\"  The Council of Powhatan. From Smith's \"General History,\"]    [1614-1619]    The year 1614 was distinguished by the marriage of Pocahontas, daughter  of the native chief Powhatan, to the English colonist Rolfe. With him  she visited England, dying there a few years later. The alliance secured  the valuable friendship of Powhatan and his subjects--only till  Powhatan's death, however. Thenceforth savage hostilities occurred at  frequent intervals. In 1622 they were peculiarly severe, over three  hundred settlers losing their lives through them. Another outbreak took  place about 1650, this time more quickly suppressed. We shall see in a  later chapter how Bacon's Rebellion was occasioned by Indian troubles.    As James I. broke with Parliament, a majority of the Virginia  shareholders proved Liberals, and they wrought with signal purpose and  effect to realize their ideas in their colony. To this political  complexion of the Virginia Company not only Virginia itself, but, in a  way, all America is indebted for a start toward free institutions.  During the governorship of George Yeardley, was summoned an assembly of  burgesses, consisting of two representatives, elected by the  inhabitants, from each of the eleven boroughs or districts which the  colony had by this time come to embrace. It met on June 10, 1619, the  earliest legislative body in the New World. This was the dawn of another  new era in the colony's history.    [Illustration: Pocahantas]    [1622-1625]    In 1622 arrived Sir Thomas Wyatt, bringing a written constitution from  the Company, which confirmed to the colony representative government and  trial by jury. The assembly was given authority to make laws, subject  only to the Governor's veto. This enlargement of political rights was  due to the growth of the sentiment of popular liberty in England. In the  meetings of the London Company debates were frequent and spirited  between the court faction and the supporters of the political rights of  the colonists. James I., dissatisfied with the authority which he had  himself granted, appointed a commission to inquire into the Company's  management, and also into the circumstances of the colony. A change was  recommended, the courts decided as the king wished, and the Company was  dissolved, The colony, while still allowed to govern itself by means of  its popular assembly, was thus brought directly under the supervision of  the Crown. Charles I., coming to the throne in 1625, gave heed to the  affairs of the colony only so far as necessary to secure for himself the  profits of the tobacco trade, It was doubtless owing to his indifference  that the colony continued to enjoy civil freedom. He again appointed  Yeardley Governor, a choice agreeable to the people; and in 1628, by  asking that the assembly be called in order to vote him a monopoly of  the coveted trade, he explicitly recognized the legitimacy and authority  of that body.    [1642]    Yeardley was succeeded by Harvey, who rendered himself unpopular by  defending in all land disputes the claims arising under royal grant  against those based upon occupancy. Difficulties of this sort pervaded  all colonial history.    In 1639 Wyatt held the office, succeeded in 1642 by Berkeley, during  whose administration the colony attained its highest prosperity.  Virginians now possessed constitutional rights and privileges in even a  higher degree than Englishmen in the northern colonies. The colonists  were most loyal to the king, and were let alone. They were also attached  to the Church of England, ever manifesting toward those of a different  faith the spirit of intolerance characteristic of the age.    [1650]    During the civil war in England, Virginia, of course, sided with the  king. When Cromwell had assumed the reins of government he sent an  expedition to require the submission of the colony. An agreement was  made by which the authority of Parliament was acknowledged, while the  colony in return was left unmolested in the management of its own  affairs.

History  nowhere authentically records any instance of Mohammad's enforcing  conversion by means of the sword.    [Footnote 33: The Life of Mahomet from original sources, by Sir W. Muir,  LL.D. New Edition, page 68, London, 1877. See also page 57 of the  same.]      [Sidenote: A brief sketch of the propagation of Islam at Mecca.]    [Sidenote: Conversion at Nakhla.]    19. Mohammad propagated his religion both at Mecca and Medina before, as  well as after, the Hegira, by persuasion and preaching sustained by  reasonable evidence. It prevailed against all persecution and opposition  of the Koreish and Jews. In fact, it flourished and prospered under the  severe persecutions and crushing oppositions by the mere dint of its own  truth.[34] Sometimes the persecution of the Koreish itself was the cause  of conversion to the Moslem faith.[35] The number of converts during the  first three years after the assumption by Mohammad of his prophetical  office is estimated at fifty. Then commenced the general persecution and  the overwhelming opposition. Mohammad had, in order to prosecute his  endeavours peaceably and without interruption, occupied the house of  Arqam, one of his early converts, and there preached and recited the  Koran to those who used to be conducted to him. A great multitude  believed therein; but the brunt of the jealousy and enmity of the  Koreish fell upon the converted slaves, as well as upon strangers and  believers among the lower classes, who had no patron nor protector. Some  believers, sixteen in number, had already left for Abyssinia. Some came  back and brought tidings of their kind reception there. At this time  about a hundred Moslems emigrated to Abyssinia.[36] This shows the  increasing number of the converts, who represented for the most part  fugitives of Mecca. There were some Christian converts to Islam at  Abyssinia also.[37] The Koreish being disquieted by the hospitable  reception of the refugees at Abyssinia, and enraged by the refusal of  Najashee to surrender them, sought to stay the progress of secession  from their ranks by utterly severing the party of the Prophet from  social and friendly communication with them. In the seventh year of the  Prophet's mission the ban commenced, and lasted for full three years.  There could be very few conversions during the period of this weary  seclusion. The efforts of the Prophet were chiefly confined to the  conversions of the members of his own noble clan, the Bani Hashim, who,  though unbelievers in his mission, had resolved to defend his person,  and were with him in their confinement. The time of pilgrimage alone  afforded Mohammad a wider field. He preached against idolatry at the  fairs and assemblages of the pilgrims[38]. After his release from  imprisonment in the tenth year of his mission, he went to preach at  Tayif, but was ignominiously expelled the city[39]. On his return to  Mecca he converted a party of the tribe of Jinn[40] (not Genii according  to the vulgar notion)[41] at Nakhla. After his return from Tayif he  preached to an audience of six or seven persons from Medina, who  believed and spread Islam there.    [Footnote 34: I do not mean to say that flourishing under persecution is  a convincing proof of the divine origin of a religion. Not that a  religion established by force is altogether of human invention. Almost  all religions are divine however they may have been established, but  flourishing under opposition and persecution is a natural course.  Christianity suffered from persecutions and other harrowing evils for  300 years, after which time it was established, and paganism abolished  by public authority, which has had great influence in the propagation of  the one and destruction of the other ever since.]    [Footnote 35: \"The severity and injustice of the Cureish, overshooting  the mark, aroused personal and family sympathies; unbelievers sought to  avert or to mitigate the sufferings of the followers of the Prophet; and  in so doing they were sometimes themselves gained over to his side.\" The  Life of Mahomet, by Sir W.

The Bani Shaitan (the children of Satan) dwelt  near Kufa.--_Vide_ Qalqashandi's Dictionary of Arab Tribes.]    [Footnote 41: Sura XLVI, verses 28, 29. These people were from Nisibin  and Nineveh in Mesopotamia. They were Chaldeans, soothsayers, and  cabalists. In the book of Daniel the Chaldeans are classed with  magicians and astronomers, and evidently form a sort of the priest class  who have a peculiar \"tongue\" and \"learning\" (Dan. I. 4). In Arabic,  persons of similar professions were called _Kahins_. Some of this class  of people pretended to receive intelligence of what was to come to pass  from certain satans or demons, whom they alleged to hear what passed in  the heavens. Others pretended to control the stars by enchanting them.  They produced eclipses of the sun and moon by their alleged efficiency  in their own enchantments. They practised astrology as well as astronomy  and fortune-telling.    It appears that the Chaldeans (Kaldai or Kaldi) were in the earliest  times merely one out of the many Cushite tribes inhabiting the great  alluvial plain known afterwards as Chaldea or Babylonia. In process of  time as the Kaldi grew in power, their name prevailed over that of the  other tribes inhabiting the country; and by the era of the Jewish  captivity it had begun to be used generally for all the inhabitants of  Babylonia. It had thus come by this time to have two senses, both  ethnic: in the one, it was the special appellative of a particular race  to whom it had belonged from the remotest times; in the other, it  designated the nation at large in which the race was predominant.  Afterwards it was transferred from an ethnic to a mere restricted sense,  from the name of a people to that of a priest caste or sect of  philosophers. The Kaldi proper belonged to the Cushite race. While both  in Assyria and in Babylonia, the sernitic type of speech prevailed for  special purposes, the ancient Cushite dialect was purely reserved for  scientific and religious literature. This is no doubt the \"learning\" and  the \"tongue\" to which reference is made in the Bible (Dan. I. 4). It  became gradually inaccessible to the great mass of people who had  emigrated by means, chiefly, of Assyrian influence. But it was the  Chaldean learning in the old Chaldean or Cushite language. Hence all who  studied it, whatever their origin or race, were, on account of their  knowledge, termed Chaldeans. In this sense Daniel himself, \"the master  of Chaldeans\" (Dan. V. 11.), would, no doubt, have been reckoned among  them, and so we find Seleucas, a Greek, called a Chaldean by Strabo  (XVI. 1, Sec. 6). The Chaldeans were really a learned class, who by their  acquaintance with the language of science became its depositaries. They  were priests, magicians or astronomers, as their preference for one or  other of those occupations inclined them; and in the last of these three  capacities they probably effected discoveries of great importance. The  Chaldeans, it would appear, congregated into bodies forming what we may  perhaps call universities, and they all engaged together in it for their  progress. They probably mixed up to some extent astrology with their  astronomy, even in the earlier times, but they certainly made great  advance in astronomical science to which their serene sky and  transparent atmosphere specially invited them. In later times they seem  certainly to have degenerated into mere fortune-tellers (_vide_ Smith's  Dict. of the Bible, Art. _Chaldeans_).    In their practice of astromancy or enchanting the stars, and in  pretending to overhear what passed in the heavens, they, the Jinns, used  to sit on the tops of lofty mansions at night-time for hours offering  sacrifices to the stars and enchanting them. In their peculiar tongue  and learning they called this practice \"stealing a hearing\" and \"sitting  for listening\" (Suras XV, verse 17, and LXXII, verses 8, 9).    Now at the time of Mohammad's assuming the Prophet's office there had  been an unusually grand display of numerous falling stars, which at  certain periods are known to be specially abundant. At the same time  there were good many comets visible in different parts of heavens, which  certainly might have smitten with terror these Jinns, _i.e._, the  astromancers and soothsayers. There was one comet visible in 602 A.D.,  and other two appeared in 605 A.D. In 607 A.D. two"]]]
