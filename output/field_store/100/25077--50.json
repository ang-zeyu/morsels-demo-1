His enormous jaws are widely opened at  each expiration, his under-lip hangs over the chin, and the hairy  ridge and scalp are contracted upon the brow, presenting an aspect of  indescribable ferocity.    \"The females and young, at the first cry, quickly disappear. He then  approaches the enemy in great fury, pouring out his horrid cries in  quick succession. The hunter awaits his approach with his gun  extended; if his aim is not sure he permits the animal to grasp the  barrel, and as he carries it to his mouth (which is his habit) he  fires. Should the gun fail to go off, the barrel (that of the ordinary  musket, which is thin), is crashed between his teeth and the encounter  soon proves fatal to the hunter.    \"In the wild state their habits are in general like those of the  _Troglodytes niger_, building their nests loosely in trees, living  on similar fruits, and changing their place of resort from force of  circumstances.\"    Dr. Savage's observations were confirmed and supplemented by those of  Mr. Ford, who communicated an interesting paper on the Gorilla to the  Philadelphian Academy of Sciences, in 1852. With respect to the  geographical distribution of this greatest of all the man-like Apes,  Mr. Ford remarks:    \"This animal inhabits the range of mountains that traverse the  interior of Guinea from the Cameroon in the north to Angola in the  south, and about one hundred miles inland, and called by the  geographers Crystal Mountains. The limit to which this animal extends,  either north or south, I am unable to define. But that limit is  doubtless some distance north of this river [Gaboon]. I was able to  certify myself of this fact in a late excursion to the head-waters of  the Mooney (Danger) River, which comes into the sea some sixty miles  from this place. I was informed (credibly, I think), that they were  numerous among the mountains in which that river rises, and far north  of that.    \"In the south, this species extends to the Congo River, as I am told  by native traders who have visited the coast, between the Gaboon and  that river. Beyond that, I am not informed. This animal is only found  at a distance from the coast in most cases, and, according to my best  information, approaches it nowhere so nearly as on the south side of  this river, where they have been found within ten miles of the sea.  This, however, is only of late occurrence. I am informed by some of  the oldest Mpongwe men that formerly he was only found on the sources  of the river, but that at present he may be found within half a day's  walk of its mouth. Formerly he inhabited the mountainous ridge where  Bushmen alone inhabited, but now he boldly approaches the Mpongwe  plantations. This is doubtless the reason of the scarcity of  information in years past, as the opportunities for receiving a  knowledge of the animal have not been wanting; traders having for one  hundred years frequented this river, and specimens, such as have been  brought here within a year, could not have been exhibited without  having attracted the attention of the most stupid.\"    One specimen Mr. Ford examined weighed one hundred and seventy pounds,  without the thoracic or pelvic viscera, and measured four feet four  inches round the chest. This writer describes so minutely and  graphically the onslaught of the Gorilla--though he does not for a  moment pretend to have witnessed the scene--that I am tempted to give  this part of his paper in full, for comparison with other narratives.    \"He always rises to his feet when making an attack, though he  approaches his antagonist in a stooping posture.    \"Though he never lies in wait, yet, when he hears, sees, or scents a  man, he immediately utters his characteristic cry, prepares for an  attack, and always acts on the offensive. The cry he utters resembles  a grunt more than a growl, and is similar to the cry of the Chimpanzee  when irritated, but vastly louder. It is said to be audible at a great  distance. His preparation consists in attending the females and young  ones, by whom he is usually accompanied, to a little distance. He,  however, soon returns with his crest erect and projecting forward, his  nostrils dilated, and his under-lip thrown down; at the same time  uttering his characteristic yell, designed, it would seem, to terrify  his antagonist. Instantly, unless he is disabled by a well-directed  shot, he makes an onset, and, striking his antagonist with the palm of  his hands, or seizing him with a grasp from which there is no escape,  he dashes him upon the ground, and lacerates him with his tusks.    \"He is said to seize a musket, and instantly crush the barrel between  his teeth.... This animal's savage nature is very well shown by the  implacable desperation of a young one that was brought here. It was  taken very young, and kept four months, and many means were used to  tame it; but it was incorrigible, so that it bit me an hour before it  died.\"    [Illustration: HAND OF GORILLA, ORANG, GIBBON, AND CHIMPANZEE.]          SOME STRANGE NURSERIES    (FROM NATURE'S WORKSHOP.)    BY GRANT ALLEN.      [Illustration]    You could hardly find a better rough test of relative development in  the animal (or vegetable) world than the number of young produced and  the care bestowed upon them. The fewer the offspring, the higher the  type. Very low animals turn out thousands of eggs with reckless  profusion; but they let them look after themselves, or be devoured by  enemies, as chance will have it. The higher you go in the scale of  being, the smaller the families, but the greater amount of pains  expended upon the rearing and upbringing of the young. Large broods  mean low organization; small broods imply higher types and more care  in the nurture and education of the offspring. Primitive kinds produce  eggs wholesale, on the off chance that some two or three among them  may perhaps survive an infant mortality of ninety-nine per cent, so as  to replace their parents. Advanced kinds produce half a dozen young,  or less, but bring a large proportion of these on an average up to  years of discretion.    [Illustration: SEA-HORSES.]    Without taking into account insects and such other \"small deer,\"--to  quote Shakespeare's expression,--this fundamental principle of  population will become at once apparent if we examine merely familiar  instances of back-boned or vertebrate animals. The lowest vertebrates  are clearly the fishes: and the true fishes have almost invariably  gigantic families. A single cod, for example, is said to produce,  roughly speaking, nine million eggs at a birth (I cannot pretend I  have checked this calculation); but supposing they were only a  million, and that one-tenth of those eggs alone ever came to maturity,  there would still be a hundred thousand codfish in the sea this year  for every pair that swam in it last year: and these would increase to  a hundred thousand times that number next year; and so on, till in  four or five years' time the whole sea would be but one solid mass of  closely-packed cod-banks. We can see for ourselves that nothing of the  sort actually occurs--practically speaking, there are about the same  number of cod one year as another. In spite of this enormous  birth-rate, therefore, the cod population is not increasing--it is at  a standstill. What does that imply? Why, that taking one brood and one  year with another, only a pair of cod, roughly speaking, survive to  maturity out of each eight or nine million eggs. The mother cod lays  its millions, in order that two may arrive at the period of spawning.  All the rest get devoured as eggs, or snapped up as young fry, or else  die of starvation, or are otherwise unaccounted for. It seems to us a  wasteful way of replenishing the earth: but it is nature's way; we can  only bow respectfully to her final decision.    Frogs and other amphibians stand higher in the scale of life than  fish; they have acquired legs in place of fins, and lungs instead of  gills; they can hop about on shore with perfect freedom. Now, frogs  still produce a great deal of spawn, as every one knows: but the eggs  in each brood are numbered in their case by hundreds, or at most by a  thousand or two, not by millions as with many fishes. The spawn  hatches out as a rule in ponds, and we have all seen the little black  tadpoles crowding the edges of the water in such innumerable masses  that one would suppose the frogs to be developed from them must cover  the length and breadth of England. Yet what becomes of them all?  Hundreds are destroyed in the early tadpole stage--eaten up or  starved, or crowded out for want of air and space and water: a few  alone survive or develop four legs, and absorb their tails and hop on  shore as tiny froglings. Even then the massacre of the innocents  continues. Only a tithe of those which succeeded in quitting their  native pond ever return to it full grown, to spawn in due time, and  become the parents of further generations.    Lizards and other reptiles make an obvious advance on the frog type;  they lay relatively few eggs, but they begin to care for their young.  The family is not here abandoned at birth, as among frogs, but is  frequently tended and fed and overlooked by the mother. In birds we  have a still higher development of the same marked parental tendency;  only three or four eggs are laid each year, as a rule, and on these  eggs the mother sits, while both parents feed the callow nestlings  till such time as they are able to take care of themselves and pick  up their own living. Among mammals, which stand undoubtedly at the  head of created nature, the lower types, like mice and rabbits, have  frequent broods of many young at a time; but the more advanced groups,  such as the horses, cows, deer, and elephants, have usually one foal  or calf at a birth, and seldom produce more than a couple.

Anthony, on the Charge of (#9)"],[1,"s, as I hold, an entire mistake. The  leading object of the second section was the readjustment of the  representation of the States in Congress, rendered necessary by the  abolition of chattel slavery [_not of political slavery_], effected by  the thirteenth amendment. This object the section accomplishes, and in  this respect it remains wholly untouched, by my construction of it.    Neither do I think the position tenable which has been taken by one  tribunal, to which the consideration of this subject was presented, that  the constitutional provision does not execute itself.    The provisions on which we rely were negative merely, and were designed  to nullify existing as well as any future State legislation interfering  with our rights. This result was accomplished by the constitution  itself. Undoubtedly before we could exercise our right, it was necessary  that there should be a time and place appointed for holding the election  and proper officers to hold it, with suitable arrangements for receiving  and counting the votes. All this was properly done by existing  laws, and our right _being made complete by the Constitution, no further  legislation was required in our behalf_. When the State officers  attempted to interpose between us and the ballot-box the State  Constitution or State law, whether ancient or recent, abridging or  denying our equal right to vote with other citizens, we had but to refer  to the United States Constitution, prohibiting the States from enforcing  any such constitutional provision or law, and our rights were complete;  we needed neither Congressional nor State legislation in aid of them.    The opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley, in a case in the United States  Circuit Court in New Orleans (_1 Abb. U.S. Rep. 402_) would seem to be  decisive of this question, although the right involved in that case was  not that of the elective franchise. The learned justice says: \"It was  very ably contended on the part of the defendants that the fourteenth  amendment was intended only to secure to all citizens _equal capacities  before the law_. That was at first our view of it. But it does not so  read. The language is: 'No State shall abridge the privileges or  immunities of citizens of the United States.' What are the privileges  and immunities of citizens? Are they capacities merely? Are they not  also rights?\"    Senator Carpenter, who took part in the discussion of the fourteenth  amendment in the Senate, and aided in its passage, says: \"The fourteenth  amendment executes itself in _every_ State of the Union.... It is thus  the will of the United States in every State, and silences every State  Constitution, usage or law which conflicts with it.... And if this  provision does protect the colored citizen, then it protects every  citizen, black or white, male or female.... And all the privileges and  immunities which I vindicate to a colored citizen, I vindicate to our  mothers, our sisters and our daughters.\"--_Chicago Legal News_, vol.  iv., No. 15.    It has been said, with how much or how little truth I do not know, that  the subject of securing to women the elective franchise was not  considered in the preparation, or in the adoption of these amendments.  It is wholly immaterial whether that was so or not. It is never possible  to arrive at the intention of the people in adopting constitutions,  except by referring to the language used. As is said by Mr. Cooley, \"the  intent is to be found in the instrument itself\" (p. 55), and to that I  have confined my remarks. It is not a new thing for constitutional and  legislative acts to have an effect beyond the anticipation of those who  framed them. It is undoubtedly true, that in exacting _Magna Charta_  from King John, the Barons of England provided better securities for the  rights of the common people than they were aware of at the time,  although the rights of the common people were neither forgotten nor  neglected by them. It has also been said, perhaps with some truth, that  the framers of the original Constitution of the United States \"builded  better than they knew;\" and it is quite possible that in framing the  amendments under consideration, those engaged in doing it have  accomplished a much greater work than they were at the time aware of. I  am quite sure that it will be fortunate for the country, if this great  question of female suffrage, than which few greater were ever presented  for the consideration of any people, shall be found, almost  unexpectedly, to have been put at rest.    The opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley, in regard to this amendment, in the  case before referred to, if I understand it, corresponds very nearly  with what I have here said. The learned judge, in one part of his  opinion, says: \"It is possible that those who framed the article were  not themselves aware of the far-reaching character of its terms. They  may have had in mind but one particular phase of social and political  wrong, which they desired to redress--yet, if the amendment, as framed  and expressed, does, in fact, have a broader meaning, and does extend  its protecting shield over those who were never thought of when it was  conceived and put in form, and does reach such social evils which were  never before prohibited by constitutional amendment, it is to be  presumed that the American people, in giving it their imprimatur,  understood what they were doing, and meant to decree what has, in fact,  been done....    \"It embraces much more. The 'privileges and immunities' secured by the  original Constitution were only such as each State gave its own  citizens. Each was prohibited from discriminating in favor of its own  citizens, and against the citizens of other States.    \"But the fourteenth amendment prohibits any State from abridging the  privileges or immunities of the citizens of the United States, whether  its own citizens or any others. It not merely requires equality of  privileges, but it demands that _the privileges and immunities of all  citizens shall be absolutely unabridged, unimpaired_. (_1 Abbott's U.S.  Rep. 397._)    It will doubtless be urged as an objection to my position (that  citizenship carries with it the right to vote) that it would, in that  case, follow that infants and lunatics, who, as well as adults and  persons of sound mind, are citizens, would also have that right. This  objection, which appears to have great weight with certain classes of  persons, is entirely without force. It takes no note of the familiar  fact, that every legislative provision, whether constitutional or  statutory, which confers any _discretionary_ power, is always confined  in its operation to persons who are _compos mentis_. It is wholly  unnecessary to except idiots and lunatics out of any such statute. They  are excluded from the very nature of the case. The contrary supposition  would be simply absurd. And, in respect to every such law, infants,  during their minority, are in the same class. But are women, _who are  not infants_, ever included in this category? Does any such principle  of exclusion apply to them? Not at all. On the contrary, they stand, in  this respect, upon the same footing as men, with the sole exception of  the right to vote and the right to hold office. In every other respect,  whatever rights and powers are conferred upon persons by law may be  exercised by women as well as by men. They may transact any kind of  business for themselves, or as agents or trustees for others; may be  executors or administrators, with the same powers and responsibilities  as men; and it ought not to be a matter of surprise or regret that they  are now placed, by the fourteenth amendment, in other respects upon a  footing of perfect equality.    Although not directly connected with the argument as to the right  secured to women by the Constitution, I deem it not improper to allude  briefly to some of the popular objections against the propriety of  allowing females the privilege of voting. I do this because I know from  past experience that these popular objections, having no logical bearing  upon the subject, are yet, practically, among the most potent arguments  against the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment, which I consider  the only one that its language fairly admits of.    It is said that women do not desire to vote. Certainly many women do  not, but that furnishes no reason for denying the right to those who do  desire to vote. Many men decline to vote. Is that a reason for denying  the right to those who would vote?    I believe, however, that the public mind is greatly in error in regard  to the proportion of female citizens who would vote if their right to do  so were recognized. In England there has been to some extent a test of  that question, with the following result, as given in the newspapers,  the correctness of which, in this respect, I think there is no reason to  doubt:    \"Woman suffrage is, to a certain extent, established in England, with  the result as detailed in the London _Examiner_, that in 66 municipal  elections, out of every 1,000 women who enjoy equal rights with men on  the register, 516 went to the poll, which is but 48 less than the  proportionate number of men. And out of 27,949 women registered, where a  contest occurred, 14,416 voted. Of men there were 166,781 on the  register, and 90,080 at the poll. The _Examiner_ thereupon draws this  conclusion: 'Making allowance for the reluctance of old spinsters to  change their habits, and the more frequent illness of the sex, it is  manifest that women, if they had opportunity, would exercise the  franchise as freely as men. There is an end, therefore, of the argument  that women would not vote if they had the power.'\"    Our law books furnish, perhaps, more satisfactory evidence of the  earnestness with which women in England are claiming the right to vote,  under the reform act of 1867, aided by Lord Brougham's act of 1850.
