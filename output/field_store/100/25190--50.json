[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#9)"],[1,"friendless and hungry boy, in his extremest need--and when he did  not dare to look for succor--found himself in the strong, protecting  arms of a mother; a mother who was, at the moment (being endowed with  high powers of manner as well as matter) more than a match for all  his enemies. I shall never forget the indescribable expression of her  countenance, when I told her that I had had no food since morning; and  that Aunt Katy said she \"meant to starve the life out of me.\" There was  pity in her glance at me, and a fiery indignation at Aunt Katy at the  same time; and, while she took the corn from me, and gave me a large  ginger cake, in its stead, she read Aunt Katy a lecture which she never  forgot. My mother threatened her with complaining to old master in my  behalf; for the latter, though harsh and cruel himself, at times, did  not sanction the meanness, injustice, partiality and oppressions enacted  by Aunt Katy in the kitchen. That night I learned the fact, that I was,  not only a child, but _somebody's_ child. The \"sweet cake\" my mother  gave me was in the shape of a heart, with a rich, dark ring glazed upon  the edge of it. I was victorious, and well off for the moment; prouder,  on my mother's knee, than a king upon his throne. But my triumph was  short. I dropped off to sleep, and waked in the morning only to find my  mother gone, and myself left at the mercy of the sable virago, dominant  in my old master's kitchen, whose fiery wrath was my constant dread.    I do not remember to have seen my mother after this occurrence. Death  soon ended the little communication that had{44} existed between us;  and with it, I believe, a life judging from her weary, sad, down-cast  countenance and mute demeanor--full of heartfelt sorrow. I was not  allowed to visit her during any part of her long illness; nor did I see  her for a long time before she was taken ill and died. The heartless and  ghastly form of _slavery_ rises between mother and child, even at the  bed of death. The mother, at the verge of the grave, may not gather her  children, to impart to them her holy admonitions, and invoke for them  her dying benediction. The bond-woman lives as a slave, and is left to  die as a beast; often with fewer attentions than are paid to a favorite  horse. Scenes of sacred tenderness, around the death-bed, never  forgotten, and which often arrest the vicious and confirm the virtuous  during life, must be looked for among the free, though they sometimes  occur among the slaves. It has been a life-long, standing grief to me,  that I knew so little of my mother; and that I was so early separated  from her. The counsels of her love must have been beneficial to me. The  side view of her face is imaged on my memory, and I take few steps in  life, without feeling her presence; but the image is mute, and I have no  striking words of her's treasured up.    I learned, after my mother's death, that she could read, and that she  was the _only_ one of all the slaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who  enjoyed that advantage. How she acquired this knowledge, I know not, for  Tuckahoe is the last place in the world where she would be apt to find  facilities for learning. I can, therefore, fondly and proudly ascribe  to her an earnest love of knowledge. That a \"field hand\" should learn  to read, in any slave state, is remarkable; but the achievement of my  mother, considering the place, was very extraordinary; and, in view of  that fact, I am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute any love of  letters I possess, and for which I have got--despite of prejudices only  too much credit, _not_ to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity, but to the  native genius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated _mother_--a  woman, who belonged to a race{45 PENALTY FOR HAVING A WHITE FATHER}  whose mental endowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold in  disparagement and contempt.    Summoned away to her account, with the impassable gulf of slavery  between us during her entire illness, my mother died without leaving me  a single intimation of _who_ my father was. There was a whisper, that my  master was my father; yet it was only a whisper, and I cannot say that  I ever gave it credence. Indeed, I now have reason to think he was not;  nevertheless, the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that,  by the laws of slavery, children, in all cases, are reduced to the  condition of their mothers. This arrangement admits of the greatest  license to brutal slaveholders, and their profligate sons, brothers,  relations and friends, and gives to the pleasure of sin, the additional  attraction of profit. A whole volume might be written on this single  feature of slavery, as I have observed it.    One might imagine, that the children of such connections, would fare  better, in the hands of their masters, than other slaves. The rule  is quite the other way; and a very little reflection will satisfy the  reader that such is the case. A man who will enslave his own blood,  may not be safely relied on for magnanimity. Men do not love those who  remind them of their sins unless they have a mind to repent--and the  mulatto child's face is a standing accusation against him who is master  and father to the child. What is still worse, perhaps, such a child is  a constant offense to the wife. She hates its very presence, and when a  slaveholding woman hates, she wants not means to give that hate telling  effect. Women--white women, I mean--are IDOLS at the south, not WIVES,  for the slave women are preferred in many instances; and if these  _idols_ but nod, or lift a finger, woe to the poor victim: kicks, cuffs  and stripes are sure to follow. Masters are frequently compelled to sell  this class of their slaves, out of deference to the feelings of their  white wives; and shocking and scandalous as it may seem for a man to  sell his own blood to the traffickers in human flesh, it is often an  act of humanity{46} toward the slave-child to be thus removed from his  merciless tormentors.    It is not within the scope of the design of my simple story, to comment  upon every phase of slavery not within my experience as a slave.    But, I may remark, that, if the lineal descendants of Ham are only to be  enslaved, according to the scriptures, slavery in this country will soon  become an unscriptural institution; for thousands are ushered into the  world, annually, who--like myself--owe their existence to white  fathers, and, most frequently, to their masters, and master's sons.  The slave-woman is at the mercy of the fathers, sons or brothers of her  master. The thoughtful know the rest.    After what I have now said of the circumstances of my mother, and my  relations to her, the reader will not be surprised, nor be disposed to  censure me, when I tell but the simple truth, viz: that I received the  tidings of her death with no strong emotions of sorrow for her, and with  very little regret for myself on account of her loss. I had to learn the  value of my mother long after her death, and by witnessing the devotion  of other mothers to their children.    There is not, beneath the sky, an enemy to filial affection so  destructive as slavery. It had made my brothers and sisters strangers  to me; it converted the mother that bore me, into a myth; it shrouded my  father in mystery, and left me without an intelligible beginning in the  world.    My mother died when I could not have been more than eight or nine years  old, on one of old master's farms in Tuckahoe, in the neighborhood of  Hillsborough. Her grave is, as the grave of the dead at sea, unmarked,  and without stone or stake.

It is generally supposed that slavery, in the state of Maryland, exists  in its mildest form, and that it is totally divested of those harsh and  terrible peculiarities, which mark and characterize the slave system,  in the southern and south-western states of the American union. The  argument in favor of this opinion, is the contiguity of the free states,  and the exposed condition of slavery in Maryland to the moral, religious  and humane sentiment of the free states.    I am not about to refute this argument, so far as it relates to slavery  in that state, generally; on the contrary, I am willing to admit that,  to this general point, the arguments is well grounded. Public opinion  is, indeed, an unfailing restraint upon the cruelty and barbarity of  masters, overseers, and slave-drivers, whenever and wherever it can  reach them; but there are certain secluded and out-of-the-way places,  even in the state of Maryland, seldom visited by a single ray of  healthy public sentiment--where{48} slavery, wrapt in its own congenial,  midnight darkness, _can_, and _does_, develop all its malign and  shocking characteristics; where it can be indecent without shame,  cruel without shuddering, and murderous without apprehension or fear of  exposure.    Just such a secluded, dark, and out-of-the-way place, is the \"home  plantation\" of Col. Edward Lloyd, on the Eastern Shore, Maryland. It is  far away from all the great thoroughfares, and is proximate to no  town or village. There is neither school-house, nor town-house in its  neighborhood. The school-house is unnecessary, for there are no children  to go to school. The children and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#9)"],[1,"their hunters and discussed  the business of the day. The women and children prepared to descend to  the fields with the youths and the old men, whose duty it was to guard  them.    \"O-dan and In-sad shall go with us,\" announced Om-at, \"we shall not  need more. Tarzan, come with me and I shall show you where Pan-at-lee  sleeps, though why you should wish to know I cannot guess--she is not  there. I have looked for myself.\"    The two entered the cave where Om-at led the way to the apartment in  which Es-sat had surprised Pan-at-lee the previous night.    \"All here are hers,\" said Om-at, \"except the war club lying on the  floor--that was Es-sat's.\"    The ape-man moved silently about the apartment, the quivering of his  sensitive nostrils scarcely apparent to his companion who only wondered  what good purpose could be served here and chafed at the delay.    \"Come!\" said the ape-man, presently, and led the way toward the outer  recess.    Here their three companions were awaiting them. Tarzan passed to the  left side of the niche and examined the pegs that lay within reach. He  looked at them but it was not his eyes that were examining them. Keener  than his keen eyes was that marvelously trained sense of scent that had  first been developed in him during infancy under the tutorage of his  foster mother, Kala, the she-ape, and further sharpened in the grim  jungles by that master teacher--the instinct of self-preservation.    From the left side of the niche he turned to the right. Om-at was  becoming impatient.    \"Let us be off,\" he said. \"We must search for Pan-at-lee if we would  ever find her.\"    \"Where shall we search?\" asked Tarzan.    Om-at scratched his head. \"Where?\" he repeated. \"Why all Pal-ul-don, if  necessary.\"    \"A large job,\" said Tarzan. \"Come,\" he added, \"she went this way,\" and  he took to the pegs that led aloft toward the summit of the cliff. Here  he followed the scent easily since none had passed that way since  Pan-at-lee had fled. At the point at which she had left the permanent  pegs and resorted to those carried with her Tarzan came to an abrupt  halt. \"She went this way to the summit,\" he called back to Om-at who  was directly behind him; \"but there are no pegs here.\"    \"I do not know how you know that she went this way,\" said Om-at; \"but  we will get pegs. In-sad, return and fetch climbing pegs for five.\"    The young warrior was soon back and the pegs distributed. Om-at handed  five to Tarzan and explained their use. The ape-man returned one. \"I  need but four,\" he said.    Om-at smiled. \"What a wonderful creature you would be if you were not  deformed,\" he said, glancing with pride at his own strong tail.    \"I admit that I am handicapped,\" replied Tarzan. \"You others go ahead  and leave the pegs in place for me. I am afraid that otherwise it will  be slow work as I cannot hold the pegs in my toes as you do.\"    \"All right,\" agreed Om-at; \"Ta-den, In-sad, and I will go first, you  follow and O-dan bring up the rear and collect the pegs--we cannot  leave them here for our enemies.\"    \"Can't your enemies bring their own pegs?\" asked Tarzan.    \"Yes; but it delays them and makes easier our defense and--they do not  know which of all the holes you see are deep enough for pegs--the  others are made to confuse our enemies and are too shallow to hold a  peg.\"    At the top of the cliff beside the gnarled tree Tarzan again took up  the trail. Here the scent was fully as strong as upon the pegs and the  ape-man moved rapidly across the ridge in the direction of the  Kor-ul-lul.    Presently he paused and turned toward Om-at. \"Here she moved swiftly,  running at top speed, and, Om-at, she was pursued by a lion.\"    \"You can read that in the grass?\" asked O-dan as the others gathered  about the ape-man.    Tarzan nodded. \"I do not think the lion got her,\" he added; \"but that  we shall determine quickly. No, he did not get her--look!\" and he  pointed toward the southwest, down the ridge.    Following the direction indicated by his finger, the others presently  detected a movement in some bushes a couple of hundred yards away.    \"What is it?\" asked Om-at. \"It is she?\" and he started toward the spot.    \"Wait,\" advised Tarzan. \"It is the lion which pursued her.\"    \"You can see him?\" asked Ta-den.    \"No, I can smell him.\"    The others looked their astonishment and incredulity; but of the fact  that it was indeed a lion they were not left long in doubt. Presently  the bushes parted and the creature stepped out in full view, facing  them. It was a magnificent beast, large and beautifully maned, with the  brilliant leopard spots of its kind well marked and symmetrical. For a  moment it eyed them and then, still chafing at the loss of its prey  earlier in the morning, it charged.    The Pal-ul-donians unslung their clubs and stood waiting the onrushing  beast. Tarzan of the Apes drew his hunting knife and crouched in the  path of the fanged fury. It was almost upon him when it swerved to the  right and leaped for Om-at only to be sent to earth with a staggering  blow upon the head. Almost instantly it was up and though the men  rushed fearlessly in, it managed to sweep aside their weapons with its  mighty paws. A single blow wrenched O-dan's club from his hand and sent  it hurtling against Ta-den, knocking him from his feet. Taking  advantage of its opportunity the lion rose to throw itself upon O-dan  and at the same instant Tarzan flung himself upon its back. Strong,  white teeth buried themselves in the spotted neck, mighty arms  encircled the savage throat and the sinewy legs of the ape-man locked  themselves about the gaunt belly.    The others, powerless to aid, stood breathlessly about as the great  lion lunged hither and thither, clawing and biting fearfully and  futilely at the savage creature that had fastened itself upon him. Over  and over they rolled and now the onlookers saw a brown hand raised  above the lion's side--a brown hand grasping a keen blade. They saw it  fall and rise and fall again--each time with terrific force and in its  wake they saw a crimson stream trickling down JA's gorgeous coat.    Now from the lion's throat rose hideous screams of hate and rage and  pain as he redoubled his efforts to dislodge and punish his tormentor;  but always the tousled black head remained half buried in the dark  brown mane and the mighty arm rose and fell to plunge the knife again  and again into the dying beast.    The Pal-ul-donians stood in mute wonder and admiration. Brave men and  mighty hunters they were and as such the first to accord honor to a  mightier.    \"And you would have had me slay him!\" cried Om-at, glancing at In-sad  and O-dan.    \"Jad-ben-Otho reward you that you did not,\" breathed In-sad.    And now the lion lunged suddenly to earth and with a few spasmodic  quiverings lay still. The ape-man rose and shook himself, even as might  JA, the leopard-coated lion of Pal-ul-don, had he been the one to  survive.    O-dan advanced quickly toward Tarzan. Placing a palm upon his own  breast and the other on Tarzan's, \"Tarzan the Terrible,\" he said, \"I  ask no greater honor than your friendship.\"    \"And I no more than the friendship of Om-at's friends,\" replied the  ape-man simply, returning the other's salute.    \"Do you think,\" asked Om-at, coming close to Tarzan and laying a hand  upon the other's shoulder, \"that he got her?\"    \"No, my friend; it was a hungry lion that charged us.\"    \"You seem to know much of lions,\" said In-sad.    \"Had I a brother I could not know him better,\" replied Tarzan.    \"Then where can she be?\" continued Om-at.    \"We can but follow while the spoor is fresh,\" answered the ape-man and  again taking up his interrupted tracking he led them down the ridge and  at a sharp turning of the trail to the left brought them to the verge  of the cliff that dropped into the Kor-ul-lul. For a moment Tarzan  examined the ground to the right and to the left, then he stood erect  and looking at Om-at pointed into the gorge.    For a moment the Waz-don gazed down into the green rift at the bottom  of which a tumultuous river tumbled downward along its rocky bed, then  he closed his eyes as to a sudden spasm of pain and turned away.    \"You--mean--she jumped?\" he asked.    \"To escape the lion,\" replied Tarzan. \"He was right behind her--look,  you can see where his four paws left their impress in the turf as he  checked his charge upon the very verge of the abyss.\"    \"Is there any chance--\" commenced Om-at, to be suddenly silenced by a  warning gesture from Tarzan.    \"Down!\" whispered the ape-man, \"many men are coming. They are  running--from down the ridge.\" He flattened himself upon his belly in  the grass, the others following his example.    For some minutes they waited thus and then the others, too, heard the  sound of running feet and now a hoarse shout followed by many more.    \"It is the war cry of the Kor-ul-lul,\" whispered Om-at--\"the hunting  cry of men who hunt men. Presently shall we see them and if  Jad-ben-Otho is pleased with us they shall not too greatly outnumber  us.\"    \"They are many,\" said Tarzan, \"forty or fifty, I should say; but how  many are the pursued and how many the pursuers we cannot even guess,  except that the latter must greatly outnumber the former, else these  would not run so fast.\"    \"Here they come,\" said Ta-den.    \"It is An-un, father of Pan-at-lee, and his two sons,\" exclaimed O-dan.  \"They will pass without seeing us if we do not hurry,\" he added looking  at Om-at, the chief, for a sign.    \"Come!\" cried the latter, springing to his feet and running rapidly to  intercept the three fugitives. The others followed him.    \"Five friends!\" shouted Om-at as An-un and his sons discovered them.    \"Adenen yo!\" echoed O-dan and In-sad.    The fugitives scarcely paused as these unexpected reinforcements joined  them but they eyed Ta-den and Tarzan with puzzled glances.    \"The Kor-ul-lul are many,\" shouted An-un. \"Wou"]]]
