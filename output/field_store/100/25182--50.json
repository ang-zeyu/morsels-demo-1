There is very little or no  poverty in Lower Canada; every man who will work there, can work; and it  is a nation rather of small farmers than of classes, with the ideas of  independence which property, however small, invariably generates in the  human breast; but with that other idea also which urges it to preserve  ancient landmarks.    It is chiefly in the large towns and in their neighbourhood that the  desire for exclusive nationality still exists, fostered by a rabid  appetite for distinction in some ardent and reckless adventurers from  the British ranks, who care little what is undermost so long as they are  uppermost.    The hostility of the British settlers to the French is by no means so  great as is so carefully and constantly described, and would altogether  cease, if not kept continually alive by Upper Canadian demonstration,  and that desire to rule exclusively which has so long been the bane of  this fine colony.    It reminds one always of the morbid hatred of France, which existed  thirty years ago in England, when Napoleon was believed, by the lower  classes--ay, and by some of the higher too--to be Apollyon in earnest.    I remember an old lord of the old school, whose family honours were not  of a hundred years, and whose ancestors had been respectable traders,  saying to me, a short time before he died, that Republican notions had  spread so much from our peace with infidel France, that he should yet  live to see those who possessed talent or energy enough among the middle  class, take those honours which he was so proud of, and with the titles  also, the estates.    Look, said he, at the absurd decoration showered on the _savans_ of  France, Baron Cuvier, for instance; and he fell into a passion, and,  being a French scholar, sang forth, in a paroxysm of gout, this  _refrain_:--      \"Travaillez, travaillez, bon tonnelier,    Racommodez, racommodez, ton Cuvier.\"    And yet he was by no means an ignorant man--was at heart a true John  Bull, and had travelled and seen the world. He was blinded by an  unquenchable hatred of France, a hatred which has now ceased in England  in consequence of the facility of intercourse, but which is revived in  France against England by those who think _la gloire_ preferable to  peace and honour.    The miserable feudal system in Lower Canada has kept the French  population in abeyance; that population is literally dormant, and the  resources of the country unused; a Seigneur, now often anything but a  Frenchman, holds an immense tract, parcelled out into little slips  amongst a peasantry, whose ideas are as limited as their lands.  Generation after generation has tilled these patches, until they are  exhausted; and thus the few proprietors who have been able to emancipate  themselves from the Seignoral thraldom sell as fast as they can obtain  purchasers; and the Seignories lapse, by failure of descent or by  cutting off the entail, as it may be termed, under the dominion of  foreigners, to the people.    It is surprising that British capitalists do not turn their attention  more to Lower Canada, where land is thus to be bought very cheap, and  which only requires manuring, a treatment that it rarely receives from  a Canadian, to bring it into heart again, and where the vast extent of  the British townships, held in free and common soccage, opens such a  field for the agriculturist.    These townships are rapidly opening up and improving, and the sales of  the British American Land Company may in round numbers be said to  average L20,000 a year, or more than 40,000 acres, averaging ten  shillings an acre.    The day's wages for a labourer on a farm in Lower Canada may be stated  at two shillings currency, about one shilling and eightpence sterling,  with food and lodging; but, excepting in the towns and in the eastern  townships, the labourers are Canadians, elsewhere chiefly Irish. In the  large towns also they are Irish, and two shillings and sixpence is the  usual price of a day's work at Montreal.    There is a great demand for English or Scotch labourers in the townships  where provisions are reasonable, and the materials for building, either  lime, stone, brick, or wood, also very moderate in price from their  abundance.    Cultivated, or rather cleared, farms may be purchased now near the  settlements for about six pounds per acre, with very often dwelling and  farms on them, and a clear title may be readily obtained, after inquiry  at the registry office of the county, to see whether any mortgage or  other encumbrance exist--a course always to be adopted, both in Upper  and Lower Canada. A settler must take the precaution of tracing the  original grant, and that the land, if he buys from an individual, is  neither Crown nor Clergy reserve, nor set apart for school or any other  public purposes. Never buy, moreover, of a squatter, or land on which a  squatter is located, for the law is very favourable to these gentry.    A squatter is a man who, axe in hand, with his gun, dog, and baggage,  sets himself down in the deep forest, to clear and improve; and this he  very frequently does, both upon public and private property; and the  Government is lenient, so that, if he makes well of it, he generally  has a right of pre-emption, or perhaps pays up only instalments, and  then sells and goes deeper into the bush. Every way there is difficulty  about squatted land, and very often the squatter will significantly  enough hint that there is such a thing as a rifle in his log castle.  Squatters are usually Americans, of the very lowest grade, or the most  ignorant of the Irish, who really believe they have a right to the soil  they occupy.    I do not profess to give an account of the Eastern Townships; the  prospectus of the British American Land Company will do that; and, as I  have never been through them entirely, so I could only advance  assertion; but I believe that they are admirably adapted for English and  Scotch settlers, and that, bounded as they are by the French Canadians  on one side, and by the United States on the other, with every facility  for roads, canals, and railways, they must become one of the richest,  most and important portions of Canada before half a century has passed  over; but it will take that time, notwithstanding railways and  locomotives, to make Jean Baptiste a useful agriculturist; and the fly  must be eradicated from the wheat before Lower Canada can ever come  within a great distance of competition in the flour market with the  upper province.    Take a steamboat voyage from Quebec to Montreal, and you pass through  French Canada; for, although there are very extensive settlements of the  race below Quebec till they are lost in the rugged mountains of  Gaspesia, yet the main body of _habitants_ rest upon the low and  tranquil shores of the St. Lawrence, for one hundred and eighty miles  between the Castle of St. Lewis and the Cathedral of Montreal. The  farm-houses, neat, and invariably whitewashed, line the river,  particularly on the left bank, like a cantonment, and go back to the  north for, at the utmost, ten or twelve miles into the then boundless  wilderness.    The cultivated ground is in narrow slips, fenced by the customary snake  fence, which is nothing more than slabs of trees split coarsely into  rails, and set up lengthways in a zig-zag form to give them stability,  with struts, or riders, at the angles, to bind them. These farms are  about nine hundred feet in width, and four or five miles in depth, being  the concessions or allotments made originally by the _seigneurs_ to the  _censitaires_, or tillers of the soil. Every here and there, a long road  is left, with cross ones, to obtain access to the farms, much in the  same way, but not near so conveniently, or well done, as the concession  lines in Upper Canada, which embrace large spaces of a hundred acre or  two hundred acre lots, including many of these lots, and giving a  sixty-six feet or a forty foot road, as the case may be, and thus  dividing the country into a series of large parallelograms, and making  every farm accessible.    Each Lower French Canadian farmer is an independent yeoman, excepting as  bound to the soil, and to certain seignorial dues and privileges, which  are, however, trifling, and far from burthensome. Taxes are unknown,  and they cheerfully support their priesthood.    It is not generally known in England that the feudal tenure--although  very laughable and absurd at this time of day, and from which some  seigneurs, but never those of unmixed French blood, are disposed to  claim titles equivalent to the baronage of England, with incomes of  about a thousand a year, or at most two, and manorial houses, resembling  very much a substantial Buckinghamshire grazier's chateau--was  originally established by the French monarchs for wise, highly useful,  and benevolent purposes.    These seigneuries were parcelled out in very large tracts of forest  along the banks of the St. Lawrence, or the rivers and bays of Lower  Canada, on the condition that they should be again parcelled out among  those who would engage to cultivate them in the strips above-mentioned.  Thus re-granted, the _seigneur_ could not eject the _habitant_, but was  allowed to receive a nominal or feudal rent from the vassal, and the  usual droits. These droits are, first, the barbarous \"_lods et  ventes_,\" or one thirteenth of the money upon every transfer which the  _habitant_ makes by sale only; but the original rent can never be  raised, whatever value the land may have attained. The rights of the  mill, that old European appanage of the lord of the soil, were also  reserved to the seigneur, who alone can build mills within his domain,  or use the waters within his boundaries for mechanical purposes; but he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20019"],[0,"Lectures on Landscape (#9)"],[1," a Venus. For  instance, two landscape-painters of much reputation in England, and  one of them in France also--David Cox and John Constable, represent a  form of blunt and untrained faculty which in being very frank and  simple, apparently powerful, and needing no thought, intelligence or  trouble whatever to observe, and being wholly disorderly, slovenly and  licentious, and therein meeting with instant sympathy from the  disorderly public mind now resentful of every trammel and ignorant of  every law--these two men, I say, represent in their intensity the  qualities adverse to all accurate science or skill in landscape art;  their work being the mere blundering of clever peasants, and deserving  no name whatever in any school of true practice, but consummately  mischievous--first, in its easy satisfaction of the painter's own  self-complacencies, and then in the pretense of ability which blinds  the public to all the virtue of patience and to all the difficulty of  precision. There is more real relation to the great schools of art,  more fellowship with Bellini and Titian, in the humblest painter of  letters on village signboards than in men like these.    Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one. You  might more easily fill a house with pictures like Constable's from  garret to cellar, than imitate one cluster of leaves by Van Eyck or  Giotto; and among all the efforts that have been made to paint our  common wild-flowers, I have only once--and that in this very year,  just in time to show it to you--seen the thing done rightly.    81. But now observe: These flowers, beautiful as they are, are not of  the Gothic school. The law of that school is that everything shall be  seen clearly, or at least, only in such mist or faintness as shall be  delightful; and I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would  be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground.  This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be  imaginative and decorative; that it represents beautiful things in the  clearest way, but not under existing conditions; and that, in fact,  you are producing jeweler's work, rather than pictures. Then the  qualities of grace in design become paramount to every other; and you  may afterwards substitute clear sky for the golden background without  danger of loss or sacrifice of system: clear sky of golden light, or  deep and full blue, for the full blue of Titian is just as much a  piece of conventional enameled background as if it were a plate of  gold; that depth of blue in relation to foreground objects being  wholly impossible.    82. There is another immense advantage in this Byzantine and Gothic  abstraction of decisive form, when it is joined with a faithful desire  of whatever truth can be expressed on narrow conditions. It makes us  observe the vital points in which character consists, and educates the  eye and mind in the habit of fastening and limiting themselves to  essentials. In complete drawing, one is continually liable to be led  aside from the main points by picturesque accidents of light and  shade; in Gothic drawing you must get the character, if at all, by a  keenness of analysis which must be in constant exercise.    83. And here I must beg of you very earnestly, once for all, to clear  your minds of any misapprehension of the nature of Gothic art, as if  it implied error and weakness, instead of severity. That a style is  restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous. Much  mischief has been done--endless misapprehension induced in this  matter--by the blundering religious painters of Germany, who have  become examples of the opposite error from our English painters of the  Constable group. Our uneducated men work too bluntly to be ever in the  right; but the Germans draw finely and resolutely wrong. Here is a  \"Riposo\" of Overbeck's for instance, which the painter imagined to be  elevated in style because he had drawn it without light and shade, and  with absolute decision: and so far, indeed, it is Gothic enough; but  it is separated everlastingly from Gothic and from all other living  work, because the painter was too vain to look at anything he had to  paint, and drew every mass of his drapery in lines that were as  impossible as they were stiff, and stretched out the limbs of his  Madonna in actions as unlikely as they are uncomfortable.    In all early Gothic art, indeed, you will find failure of this kind,  especially distortion and rigidity, which are in many respects  painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art. But  the distortion is not Gothic; the intensity, the abstraction, the  force of character are, and the beauty of color.    84. Here is a very imperfect, but illustrative border of flowers and  animals on a golden ground. The large letter contains, indeed,  entirely feeble and ill-drawn figures: that is merely childish and  failing work of an inferior hand; it is not characteristic of Gothic,  or any other school. But this peacock, being drawn with intense  delight in blue, on gold, and getting character of peacock in the  general sharp outline, instead of--as Rubens' peacocks--in black  shadow, is distinctively Gothic of fine style.    85. I wish you therefore to begin your study of natural history and  landscape by discerning the simple outlines and the pleasant colors of  things; and to rest in them as long as you can. But, observe, you can  only do this on one condition--that of striving also to create, in  reality, the beauty which you seek in imagination. It will be wholly  impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity  of faith necessary for noble purist painting, unless you are actively  engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life. None of  this bright Gothic art was ever done but either by faith in the  attainableness of felicity in heaven, or under conditions of real  order and delicate loveliness on the earth.    86. As long as I can possibly keep you among them, there you shall  stay--among the almond and apple blossom. But if you go on into the  veracities of the school of Clay, you will find there is something at  the roots of almond and apple trees, which is--This. You must look at  him in the face--fight him--conquer him with what scathe you may: you  need not think to keep out of the way of him. There is Turner's  Dragon; there is Michael Angelo's; there, a very little one of  Carpaccio's. Every soul of them had to understand the creature, and  very earnestly.    87. Not that Michael Angelo understands his dragon as the others do.  He was not enough a colorist either to catch the points of the  creature's aspect, or to feel the same hatred of them; but I confess  myself always amazed in looking at Michael Angelo's work here or  elsewhere, at his total carelessness of anatomical character except  only in the human body. It is very easy to round a dragon's neck, if  the only idea you have of it is that it is virtually no more than a  coiled sausage; and, besides, anybody can round anything if you have  full scale from white high light to black shadow.    88. But look here at Carpaccio, even in my copy. The colorist says,  \"First of all, as my delicious paroquet was ruby, so this nasty viper  shall be black\"; and then is the question, \"Can I round him off, even  though he is black, and make him slimy, and yet springy, and close  down--clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth--all the same?\"  Look at him beside Michael Angelo's, and then tell me the Venetians  can't draw! And also, Carpaccio does it with a touch, with one sweep  of his brush; three minutes at the most allowed for all the beast;  while Michael Angelo has been haggling at this dragon's neck for an  hour.    89. Then note also in Turner's that clinging to the earth--the  specialty of him--_il gran nemico_, \"the great enemy,\" Plutus. His  claws are like the Clefts of the Rock; his shoulders like its  pinnacles; his belly deep into its every fissure--glued down--loaded  down; his bat's wings cannot lift him, they are rudimentary wings  only.    90. Before I tell you what he means himself, you must know what all  this smoke about him means.    Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study  of art, than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and  more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and  great, in spirit and in matter. So that if you get once the right clue  to any group of them, it will grasp the simplest, yet reach to the  highest truths. You know I have just been telling you how this school  of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire.  Now, down to the least detail of method and subject, that will hold.    91. Here is a perfect type, though not a complex one, of Gothic  landscape; the background gold, the trees drawn leaf by leaf, and full  green in color--no effect of light. Here is an equally typical  Greek-school landscape, by Wilson--lost wholly in golden mist; the  trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or  towers, and no care for color whatever; perfectly deceptive and  marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist--\"Apollo and the  Python.\" Now here is Raphael, exactly between the two--trees still  drawn leaf by leaf, wholly formal; but beautiful mist coming gradually  into the distance. Well, then, last, here is Turner's; Greek-school of  the highest class; and you define his art, absolutely, as first the  displaying intensely, and with the sternest intellect, of natural form  as it is, and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire. Only,  there are two sorts of cloud and fire. He knows them both. There's  one, and there's another--the \"Dudley\" and the \"Flint.\" That's what  the cloud and flame of the dragon mean: now, let me show you what the  dragon means himself.    92. I go back to another perfect landscape of the living"]]]
