These three fatal faults must be avoided, or conquered, by the person  who would interpret music.          V    How to Listen to Music      Listening is an art. It requires close and accurate attention, sympathy,  imagination and genuine culture. Listening to music is an art of high  degree. Many derive exquisite enjoyment from it, for music is potent and  universal in its appeal. To listen intelligently to music is an  accomplishment few have acquired.    A great painting presents itself as a completed whole before the  observer's eye. It holds on the canvas the fixed place given it by the  master from whose genius it proceeded. No intermediary force is needed  to come between it and the impression it makes on the beholder. Music,  on the contrary, must be aroused from the written, or printed page to  living tone by the hand or voice of the interpreter, and but a fragment  at a time can be made perceptible to the listener's ear. Like a  panorama, it comes and goes before the imagination, its kaleidoscopic  tints and forms now sharply contrasted, now almost imperceptibly  graduated one into the other, but all shaping themselves into a logical  union, stamped with the design of a creative mind. Properly to inspect  the successive musical images, and grasp their significance, in parts  and as a whole, demands keen mental alertness.    Many are content to listen to music for the mere sensuous impression it  creates as it wraps itself about the inner being, lulling a perturbed  spirit to rest, or awakening longing and aspiration, joy and sadness,  according to the nature of the music and the hearer's mood. Some even  take pleasure in formulating into words the sensations evoked by the ebb  and flow of the tonal waves, and fancy they are thus deriving  intellectual profit from music.    From both ways of listening helpful results may accrue, but by no means  the greatest. Music is far beyond words, and in attempting to translate  it into these we miss its musical meaning, the best that is in it. As  listeners we derive our highest aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction  from the ability to follow, even anticipate, the composer's intention,  now finding our expectations fulfilled, now being agreeably  disappointed. Failure to catch the opening phrase and preliminary  rhythms of the composition makes it impossible to appreciate the tonal  forms into which they develop. Nor may the mind linger over any one  part, if we would grasp the work as an unbroken whole. That musical  creation alone can afford the noblest delights that prompts and rewards  the act of thus closely following the composer's thought.    An instance of absolute knowledge of music appears in an anecdote told  of Johann Sebastian Bach. When he was present at the performance of a  fugue and one of his two most musical sons was with him, he would, as  soon as the theme was heard, whisper what devices and developments he  thought should be introduced. If the composer had conformed to his idea  of construction he would jog his son to call attention to the fact.  Otherwise, his exceeding modesty and reverent comprehension of the  difficulties of the art made him the most lenient of critics.    Few have reached the luminous heights this master of masters trod. Even  a well-cultivated ear and taste may often be baffled by the intricacies  of a fugue, symphony or other great work of musical art heard for the  first time. The best listener beyond the pale of genius will at times  feel as one astray in a labyrinth of beauty to which for the moment no  clue appears. A single representation will rarely suffice to reveal the  full worth of a masterpiece of music. By hearing it often, by admitting  it, or some reproduction of it, to our own fireside, we will become  familiar with its contents and learn truly to know it.    Those who are fortunate enough to have been surrounded from childhood up  by the choicest gems of the tonal language, and whose minds are of the  deceptive order, will insensibly attain a refinement of taste and  delicacy of perception no learned dissertation on music could afford. At  the same time, an acquaintance with the materials and elements of which  the art is composed and with the laws that govern them, is essential to  enable even one who has heard much to gain the complete enjoyment that  comes from understanding. Confident as we are that Prometheus captured  his fire from Heaven, we ought to learn something of its attributes  before we accept it at his hands, that we may be able to distinguish a  true spark of the divine flame from a phosphorescent will-o'-the-wisp.    The idea so largely accepted that music is an unfathomable mystery, like  all half truths has wrought much mischief, and has greatly retarded  musical progress in social life. Behind the Divine Art, as behind  Religion, lies the inscrutable mystery of Life, and in both there is a  Holy of Holies only the consecrated may enter. Before the portals of  this are reached there is a broad, fertile field for intellectual  activity that all may work to advantage, preparing the way to the inner  sanctuary.    The musician is continually confronted with fresh evidence of the  popular ignorance, even among students of music, in regard to the  outward form and inner grace of what is conceded to be the most popular  of all arts. In a roomful of professed music lovers a definition of  counterpoint was recently called for, and no one present could give an  intelligent answer. This led to a discussion of musical questions which  resulted in the disclosure that not one of the company could define  melody, harmony or rhythm, or had the slightest conception of the  meaning of the simplest component parts of the art in whose service they  were making plentiful sacrifices. Some knowledge of these things is  absolutely imperative, not alone to the student, but to one as well who  would listen intelligently to music.    Sound and motion constitute the essence of music. Its raw materials are  an infinitely rich mass of musical sounds that bear within themselves  the possibility of being molded into form. By the musical builders of  the past they have been carefully considered, mathematically  calculated, and have finally resolved themselves into a recognized  scale, composed of tones and half tones. These are the composer's  plastic resources. He shapes them precisely as the sculptor fashions the  pliable clay with which he strives to bring his ideal to realization.    All sounds are the result of atmospheric vibrations affecting the ear.  Musical sound, or tone, is produced by regular vibrations, and differs  from mere noise whose vibrations are irregular and confused. The pitch  of a musical tone rises in proportion with the rapidity of the  vibrations that produce it. Tones may be perceived by the human ear  ranging from about sixteen vibrations in a second to nearly forty  thousand, more than eleven octaves. Only about seven octaves are used in  music. The science of acoustics is full of interesting facts of this  kind, and is of profound value to any one who would gain an insight into  the structure of music. It is unfortunately much neglected.    The prime elements of music are Melody, Harmony and Rhythm. They are  perhaps as little realized as its raw materials. Melody is a well  ordered succession of musical sounds, heard one at a time, and selected  from a defined, accepted series, not taken at random from a  heterogeneous store. Harmony is a combination of well-ordered sounds  heard simultaneously, and with suitable concord, or agreement. Rhythm is  measured movement, or the periodical recurrence of accent; and signifies  symmetry and proportion.    Melody, unexhausted and inexhaustible, is the initial force, or, as Dr.  Marx has called it, the life-blood of music. Within itself it bears the  germ of harmony and rhythm. A succession of tones without harmonious and  rhythmic regulation would be felt to lack something. Melody has been  designated the golden thread running through the maze of tone, by which  the ear is guided and the heart reached. Helmholtz styled it the  essential basis of music. In a special sense, it is artistically  constructed song. The creation of an expressive melody is a sure mark of  genius.    Harmony arranges musical sounds with reference to their union, and is  regulated by artistic and aesthetic rules and requirements. It has  endless modes of transforming, inverting and intensifying its materials,  thus continually affording new means of development. All the intervals  and chords used in music had to be discovered, one by one. It often took  more than a century to bring into a general use a chord effect  introduced by some adventuresome spirit. Our scale intervals are the  slowly gained triumphs of the human mind. Modern music did not emerge  from the darkness of the past until harmony, as we know it, came into  active being.    Both melody and harmony are controlled by rhythm. It is the master force  of the musical organism. Before man was the ebb and flow of nature had  its rhythm. On this elementary rhythm, the one model music finds in  nature, the inventive mind of man has builded the wonderfully impressive  art rhythms existing in the masterpieces of music.    Melodies are made up of smaller fragments, known as motives, phrases  and periods, or sentences, all of which are judiciously repeated and  varied, and derive their individuality from the characteristics of their  intervals and rhythms.    A motive is the text of a musical composition, the theme of its  discourse. The most simple motive, with proper handling, may grow into a  majestic structure.

The sage observes:--    \"The monarch of the day invests the dawn with delegated rays to scatter  night, and ocean sends his ministers the clouds, to shed his waters over  the widespread earth.\"    The king, taking counsel with himself, and being reminded by Vamadeva,  one of his priests and preceptors, that the race of Raghu never sent  away a petitioner ungratified, sends for Rama and Lakshmana, and allows  Viswamitra to take them with him, to his hermitage, situated on the  banks of the Kausiki or Coosy river, to protect him in his rites against  the oppression of Taraka, a Rakshasi.    The cry is heard that Taraka is abroad. Rama, after some hesitation  about killing a female, slays her.    Viswamitra now proposes that they should visit Mithila. The two princes  are introduced to Janaka, the king of Mithila, who is urged by the sage  to let Rama try to bend the bow of Siva. Sanshkala, the messenger of  Ravana, the king of Lanka, now arrives to demand Sita in marriage for  his master, refusing, at the same time, on his part, to submit to the  test of bending the bow. The demand is refused. Rama tries his fortune,  bends the bow and wins the lady. The family connection is extended by  the promise of Urmila, Mandavi, and Srutakirti, to Rama's brothers.  Sanshkala is highly indignant and carries the information to his  master's minister Malyavan, who is disappointed on Ravana's account.  Malyavan anticipates that Ravana will carry Sita off; and to render the  attempt less perilous, projects inveighing Rama into the forests alone,  for which he sends Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, in the disguise of  Manthara, the attendant of Kaukeyi.    Parasurama then appears and boasts of his destruction of the Kshatriya  race. Rama replies:--\"This flag of your fame is now worn to tatters, let  us see if you can mount a new one.\" Rama then calls for his bow, and  Parasurama presents him with his axe. They go forth to fight. In the  end, the two Ramas turn very excellent friends. Parasurama departs.    Dasaratha now declares his purpose of relinquishing the kingdom entirely  to his son Rama, Lakshmana announces the arrival of Manthara, and  presents a letter from Kaikeyi, the purpose of which is to urge  Dasaratha's fulfilment of his promise, and grant her as the two boons,  the Coronation of Bharata, and banishment of Rama. The old king faints.  Rama recommending his father to Janaka, departs for the forests,  accompanied by Lakshmana and Sita. On their arrival in the forests, they  are cordially received by Sugriva, the brother of Bali the king of the  monkeys. Lakshmana carries on a dialogue with Ravana, disguised as a  juggler.    Jatayu, the king of birds, beholds Sita carried off by Ravana. He  follows the ravisher. Rama and Lakshmana both express their grief.    Lakshmana observes:--    \"The worse the ill that Fate inflicts on noble souls, the more their  firmness; and they arm their spirits with adamant to meet the blow.\"    Rama replies:--    \"The firmness I was born with or was reared to, and rage, that fills my  heart, restrain my sorrows; but hard is the task to fit my soul to bear  unmurmuringly a husband's shame.\"    A cry of distress is now heard, and on looking out, the youths observe  Guha, the friendly forest monarch, assailed by the demon Kabandha, or a  fiend without a head. Lakshmana goes to his aid, and returns with his  friend Guha. In the act of delivering him, Lakshmana tosses away the  skeleton of Dundubhi, a giant, suspended by Bali, who, deeming this an  insult, presently appears. After a prolix interchange of civility and  defiance, Rama and Bali resolve to determine their respective supremacy  by single combat. Bali is slain. His brother Sugriva is inaugurated as  king and determines to assist Rama to recover Sita. A bridge is built  over the sea. Rama's army advance to Lanka. Kumbhakarna, a brother of  Ravana, and Meghanada, a son of Ravana, go forth to battle. Malyavan  wishes them prosperity in a phrase perfectly oracular. They are slain.  Ravana now takes the field himself. Malyavan resolves to follow him and  resign, on the sword, a life now useless to his sovereign. The king is  overthrown. Sita is recovered.    Rama with his wife and brother, accompanied by Vibhishana, the brother  of Ravana, and Sugriva, mounts the celestial car, which was once  wrested by Ravana from his brother Kuvera, and sets out to proceed to  Ayodhya.    On the way the travellers descry the Sumeru mountain, the Malaya  mountain, the Dandaka forest, the mountain Prasravana, the Godaveri  river, mount Malyavan, Kundinipura in the Maharashtra country, the  shrine of Bhimeswara, the city of Kanchi, Ujayin, the temple of  Mahakala, Mahishmati the capital of Chedi, the Jumna and Ganga rivers,  Varanasi, Mithila or Tirhut, and Champa near Bhagalpur.    They then proceed westward to Prayaga, and Antarvedi or Doab, when they  again follow an easterly course and arrive at Ayodhya.    Bharata, Satrughna, Vasishtha the priest and the people of Ayodhya await  the arrival of the party and receive them most cordially. Rama is now  crowned king.          VENI SAMVARANA OR VENI SANHARA    OR    \"THE BINDING OF THE BRAID OF HAIR.\"      Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, is dragged by the _veni_ or braid of  hair into the public assembly by the hand of Duhsasana, one of the  Kaurava princes, a disgrace that weighs most heavily upon the Pandavas,  who contemplate most bitter revenge.    Krishna returns to the Pandava camp from a visit to the Kaurava princes,  as a mediator between the contending chiefs. Ferocious Bhima expresses,  to his brother Sahadeva, his refusal to have any share in the  negotiations instituted by Krishna and his determination to make no  peace with the enemy until the insult offered to Draupadi is avenged. He  announces his resolution, in case the dispute be amicably adjusted, to  disclaim all connection with his own brothers, and throw off obedience  to Judhishthira.    The price of peace is the demand of five villages or towns,  Indraprastha, Tilaprastha, Mansadam, Varanavatam, and another. Sahadeva  attempts to calm the fury of Bhima, but in vain; and Draupadi, with her  hair still dishevelled, and pining over her ignominious treatment, comes  to inflame his resentment. She complains also of a recent affront  offered by Bhanumati, the queen of Duryodhana, in an injurious comment  upon her former exposure, which serves to widen the breach.    Krishna's embassy is unsuccessful, and he effects his return only by  employing his divine powers against the enemy. All the chiefs are  summoned by the trumpet to prepare for battle.    Before day-break, Bhanumati repeats, to her friend and an attendant, a  dream in which she has beheld a _Nakula_ or Mungoose destroy a hundred  snakes. This is very ominous, _Nakula_ being one of the Pandavas, and  the sons of Kuru amounting to a hundred. Duryodhana overhears part of  the story, and at first imagines the hostile prince is the hero of the  vision. He is about to burst upon her, full of rage, and when he catches  the true import of the tale, he is at first disposed to be alarmed by  it, but at last wisely determines to disregard it.    For, by Angira it is sung, the aspect of the planets, dreams and signs,  meteors and portents, are the sports of accident, and do not move the  wise. Bhanumati offers an _arghya_ of sandal and flowers to the rising  sun to avert the ill omen, and then the king appears and soothes her.    Their dialogue is disturbed by a rising whirlwind from which they take  shelter in a neighbouring pavilion. The mother of Jayadratha, the king  of Sindhu, then appears, and apprises Duryodhana that Arjuna has vowed,  if sunset finds Jayadratha alive, he will sacrifice himself in the  flames. His wrath is especially excited by the death of his son  Abhimanyu, in which that chieftain had borne a leading part. Duryodhana  laughs at her fears and those of his wife, and despises the resentment  of the Pandavas. He observes, that this was fully provoked by the  treatment which Draupadi received by his command, when in the presence  of the court and of the Pandavas, she called out in vain for mercy.  Duryodhana then orders his war-chariot and goes forth to the battle. Up  to the period of the contest, the following chiefs have fallen,  Bhagadatta, Sindhuraja, Angadhipa, Drupada, Bhurisravas, Somadatta, and  Bahlika.    Ghatotkacha is also slain, and Bhima is about to avenge his fall, on  which account Hirimba, the queen of the Rakshasas and mother of  Ghatotkacha, has ordered goblins to be ready to assist Bhimasena.    Drona is seized by Dhrishtadyumna and slain. Aswatthama, the son of  Drona, appears armed and is overtaken by his father's charioteer who  tells him of the treachery by which Drona was slain, having been induced  to throw away his arms by a false report that his son Aswatthama had  perished, and been then killed at a disadvantage. Aswatthama's distress  is assuaged by his maternal uncle Kripa, who recommends him to solicit  the command of the host from Duryodhana.    In the meantime, proud Kerna, the friend and ally of Duryodhana, fills  the mind of the Kuru chief with impressions hostile to Drona and his  son, persuading him that Drona only fought to secure Aswatthama's  elevation to royal dignity, and that he threw away his life, not out of  grief, but in despair at the disappointment of his ambitious schemes.  Kripa and Aswatthama now arrive and Duryodhana professes to condole with  Aswatthama for his father's loss. Kerna sneeringly asks him what he  purposes, to which he replies:--    \"Whoever confident in arms is ranked amongst the adverse host--whomever  the race of proud Panchala numbers, active youth, weak age or unborn  babes, whoever beheld my father's murder, or whoever dares to cross my  path, shall fall before my vengeance. Dark is my sight with rage, and  Death himself, the world's destroyer, should not escape my fury."]]]
