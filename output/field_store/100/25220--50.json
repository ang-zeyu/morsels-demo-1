On  arrival, he was told by the officer of the chamber that he was not  to present himself at public audience, but that Nana would speak to  him privately. He was therefore taken to an inner chamber where, an  hour later, Nana joined him.    \"I think by your face, Puntojee, that you can be trusted; and I  have decided to place you in the service of His Highness, the  Peishwa. What position you will hold there must depend upon  yourself, and him. I shall simply recommend you as one of whom I  have heard much good. It would be as well for you not to mention  your age; but let him suppose that, as you look, you are about the  same age as himself. He is amiable and kindly, and your position  will be a pleasant one.    \"I am anxious to prevent evil advisers from obtaining influence  over him. He is young and unsuspicious, and much harm might thus  come to the state. It is, then, for the general interest that he  should be surrounded by those whom I can trust; so that, if any  plotters are endeavouring to poison his mind, their plans may be  thwarted. I have of course, officers about his person who are  thoroughly trustworthy; but these are much older than himself, and  he chafes somewhat at what he wrongly considers his tutelage. But  indeed, as he is but twenty-one, and wholly unversed in matters of  state, it is needful that the management of affairs should rest in  the hands of those who have long controlled it.    \"Scindia would be the first to take advantage of any imprudence. He  is already, by far, the most powerful of the Mahratta princes. His  possessions are of immense extent; he holds the emperor at Delhi in  the palm of his hand; he can put one hundred thousand horse into  the field, and has large numbers of infantry, including sixteen  battalions drilled by French officers, and commanded by de Boigne;  and although Doulut Rao is but twenty, and as yet we know but  little of his disposition, he is of course surrounded by the  advisers of his uncle, and may be expected to pursue the same  policy. His uncle gained great ascendency over the Peishwa, and his  death was a fortunate circumstance. Still, it is certain that the  prince, until his powers are matured, will yield to the advice of  those to whom the conduct of affairs is entrusted.    \"Now, I am going to the palace, and have requested a private  audience with Mahdoo Rao, and I will take you with me.\"    Followed by a train of officers, with whom Harry fell in, the  minister proceeded to the palace. His train remained in the public  hall, and Nana went into the Peishwa's private apartment. In a few  minutes, an official came in and called Puntojee; and Harry at once  followed him to an inner room, where the Peishwa and his minister  were alone. Harry bowed to the ground.    \"This, Prince, is the young man of whom I have spoken to you. He  bears an excellent character for his skill in arms, and has killed  many tigers and other beasts. It was but the other day that you  complained that you had no one of your own age to whom you could  talk freely; and I have selected this young officer as one who, I  thought, would be agreeable to you.\"    \"I thank you heartily, Nana. In truth, I sometimes need a  companion; and I think, by his face, that this officer will be an  agreeable one. To what post, think you, had I best appoint him?\"    \"As he is a famous shikaree, I should say that it would be suitable  were you to make him director of the chase.\"    \"But I never go hunting.\"    \"That is true; but in time, when your occupations of state lessen,  you might do so,\" Nana said. \"And indeed, even at present, there is  nothing to prevent your hunting sometimes in the royal preserves,  where there must be an abundance of game of all sorts.\"    \"So let it be, then,\" the Peishwa said. \"In truth, I care not for  the killing of beasts, unless they do harm to the villagers. But it  is right that there should be someone to direct the men who have  charge of the preserves and, as an official, you will have the  right of entry here at all times, and will be frequently about my  person; and I will confer with you about other things, as well as  the chase. You will, of course, have an apartment assigned to you.    \"You will arrange about the emoluments, Nana.\"    \"You had better go to my house, and wait for me there,\" Nana said;  and Harry, bowing deeply to the prince and his minister, left the  palace.    He did not deceive himself as to the reason for which Nana had thus  placed him in a position in which he was likely to be frequently in  the company of the young prince. He intended him to act as a spy.  This he was firmly determined not to do, in any matter save in  thwarting any designs Scindia might have. That was a public duty.    By this time, he had learnt much of the events that were passing.  Ramdass and the other ryots of his acquaintance regarded Nana  Furnuwees as the guardian of the country. For many years, it was  his wisdom and firmness alone that had thwarted the designs of  Scindia, whose advent to supreme authority would have been regarded  as a grave misfortune, by all the cultivators of the Deccan.  Scindia's expenses in keeping up so great an army were enormous,  and the exactions of his tax gatherers ground to the dust the  cultivators and peasantry of his own wide dominions; and Harry was  therefore ready to give Nana a faithful support in all public  matters. He knew that the minister had many enemies, even among the  rajahs in the Peishwa's dominion, and in those round it; for they  regarded him, with reason, as a curb upon their private ambitions  and, for years, intrigues had been going on for his overthrow.    On the other hand, Harry was much pleased with Mahdoo Rao, who was  a most amiable and kindly young man. While determined, then, to do  all that he could in support of Nana; he decided that he would, on  no account, give him any report that would be unfavourable to the  Peishwa. His interview with the minister, on the return of the  latter, was a short one.    \"Here,\" the latter said, \"is a purse of five hundred rupees, with  which to obtain garments suitable for one in attendance on the  Peishwa. Your emolument will be two hundred rupees a month. I shall  issue orders to the men employed in the forests and preserves to  report to you; and have requested the chamberlain to allot an  apartment to you in the palace, and to tell off two servants to be  in attendance on you.    \"You understand that your mission, as far as I am concerned, is to  give me early warning, if any of those favourable to Scindia--you  shall be furnished with a list of their names--are endeavouring to  obtain an undue influence over the prince; who is of an altogether  unsuspicious character, and would be likely to fall an easy victim  to bad counsels.\"    \"You can depend upon my doing so,\" Harry said. \"I have been taught  to regard Scindia as an enemy to the public peace, and shall use  all diligence in carrying out your excellency's orders.\"    And, leaving the minister, Harry went to Sufder and told him what  had happened.    \"In truth, Puntojee, you were born under a lucky star. I never  dreamt that Nana Furnuwees would have thus introduced you to the  Peishwa. Now, lad, you have a fine career opened to you. It will  need caution but, as Scindia's ancestor was but a slipper bearer,  and rose to the highest rank and honour; so it is open to you to  win a great position, if you steer clear of the dangers that attend  all who play a part in public affairs. I foresee that you will  become a favourite with the prince, but remember to put your trust  in Nana. He is, at present, the greatest power in the land, and has  been so for many years but, unlike most who have attained such  authority, he is liked by the people, for he uses his power well,  and for the good of the state.    \"You see, even now the young Peishwa is by no means secure on the  musnud. The adherents of Rugoba, who was undoubtedly the lawful  ruler of the Deccan, still live; and may one day raise the flag of  revolt, in favour of his sons Bajee Rao and Chimnajee Appa who,  with Amrud Rao, his adopted son, are all in close custody in the  hill fort of Sewneree, under two of Nana's officers.    \"There is a general feeling of pity for these young men, even among  those who regard their imprisonment as necessary--for, were they  free, a civil war would assuredly break out again--and the feeling  is increased by the fact that Bajee Rao is a youth of extraordinary  accomplishments. He is graceful in person, with a handsome  countenance and a charming manner and, although but nineteen, he is  an excellent horseman, skilled in the use of the bow, and  considered to be the finest swordsman in the country. He is deeply  read in all our religious books and, in all the country, there is  no one of his age so learned.    \"All these things, however, only add to the necessity for his being  kept in prison. A youth so gifted and, as many people consider, the  lawful heir to the throne, would speedily be joined by all the  enemies of Nana; and might not only drive the minister into exile,  but dethrone Mahdoo Rao. Such being the case, no one can blame Nana  for keeping them in confinement--at any rate, until Mahdoo Rao has  been master for some years, and has proved that he is able to  maintain his position.    \"Now, lad, I will go into the town with you, and purchase dresses  fit for an official of the palace.\"    \"I quite see that I have been most fortunate in obtaining such a  position, Sufder; but I own I should have preferred to remain with  you, and learn to do service as a soldier.\"    \"That you may learn later on,\" Sufder said. \"Having the confidence  of the Peishwa, you may soon obtain military rank, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#9)"],[1," admired Ulyth immensely, and was quite prepared to take her as a model,  but at present the copy was very far indeed from the original. The  mistresses had instituted a vigorous crusade against Rona's loud voice  and unconventional English, and she was really making an effort to  improve; but the habits of years are not effaced in a few weeks, and she  still scandalized the authorities considerably. Ulyth could tolerate her  when she kept to her own side of the bedroom, but to have meddlesome  fingers interfering with her private possessions was the last straw to  her burden of endurance.    \"Do you understand?\" she repeated emphatically. \"You're not to touch my  papers at all!\"    \"All serene! I won't lay a finger on them--honest--sure!\" returned the  Cuckoo, chanting her words to the air of \"Swanee River\", and drumming an  accompaniment on the bedpost. \"What d'you think Stephanie called me just  now? She said I was an unlicked cub.\"    \"Oh, surely she didn't! Are you certain?\"    \"Heard her myself. She said it to my face and tittered. You bet I'll pay  her out somehow. Miss Stephanie Radford needs taking down a peg. Oh,  don't alarm yourself, I'll do it neatly! There'll be no clumsy bungling  about it. Well, if you won't go down and play basket-ball I shall. It's  more fun than sitting up here.\"    As the door banged behind Rona, Ulyth heaved an ecstatic \"Thank  goodness!\" She sat for a few moments trying to regain her composure  before she recommenced the writing at which she had been interrupted.  The manuscript on which she was engaged was very precious. She had set  herself no less a task than to write a book. The subject had come to her  suddenly one morning as she lay awake in bed, and she regarded it as an  inspiration. She would make a story about The Woodlands, and bring in  all the girls she knew. It was no use struggling with a historical plot  or a romance of the war--she had tried these, and stuck fast in the  first chapters; it was better to employ the material close at hand, and  weave her tale from the every-day incidents which happened in the  school. So she had begun, and though she floundered a little at the  difficulty of transferring her impressions to paper, she was making  distinct progress.    \"I'd never dare to have it published, of course,\" she ruminated. \"Still,  it's a beginning, and I shall like to read it over to myself. I think  there are some rather neat bits in it, especially that shot at Addie  and Stephie. How wild they'd be if they knew! But there's no fear of  that. I'll take good care nobody finds out.\"    When to make time to go on with her literary composition was the  difficulty. It was hard to snatch even an occasional half-hour during  the day. Where there is a will, however, there is generally also a way,  and Ulyth hit upon the plan of getting up very early in the morning and  writing while Rona was still asleep. The Cuckoo never stirred until the  seven o'clock bell rang, when she would awake noisily, with many yawns  and stretchings of arms, so Ulyth flattered herself that her secret was  absolutely safe.    Where to hide the precious papers was another problem. She did not dare  to put them in any of her drawers, her desk would not lock, and her  little jewel-box was too small to contain them.    The fireplace in the bedroom had an old-fashioned chimney-piece that was  fitted with a loose wooden mantel-board, from which hung a border of  needlework. It was quite easy to lift up this board and slip the papers  between it and the chimney-piece; the border completely screened the  hiding-place, and, except at a spring-cleaning, the arrangement was not  likely to be disturbed. Ulyth congratulated herself greatly upon her  ingenuity. It was interesting to have a secret which nobody even  guessed. She often looked at the chimney-piece, and chuckled as she  thought of what lay concealed there.    The days were rapidly closing in now, and the time between tea and  preparation, which only a few weeks ago was devoted to a last game of  tennis or a run by the stream, was perforce spent by the schoolroom  fire. It was only a short interval, not long enough to make any  elaborate occupation worth while, so the girls sat knitting in the  twilight and chatting until the bell rang for evening work.    One afternoon, when tea was finished, Ulyth, instead of joining the  others as usual, walked upstairs to put away some specimens in the  Museum. She passed V B classroom as she did so, and heard smothered  peals of mirth issuing from behind the half-closed door.    \"What are they doing?\" she thought. \"I believe I'll go and see.\" But  catching Rona's laugh above the rest, she changed her mind, walked on,  and bestowed her fossils carefully in a spare corner of one of the  cases. Meanwhile, the group assembled round the fire in V B were  enjoying themselves. The room was growing dusk, but, seated on the  hearthrug, Addie Knighton could see quite sufficiently to read aloud  extracts from a document she was perusing, extracts to which the others  listened with thrilling interest, interspersed with comments.    \"'The girls of the Oaklands',\" so she read, \"'were a rather peculiar and  miscellaneous set, especially those in the Lower Fifth. Scarcely any of  them could be called pretty--'\" (\"Oh! oh!\" howled the attentive circle.)  \"'One of them, Valerie Chadford, imagined herself so, and gave herself  fearful airs in consequence; she was very set up at knowing smart  people, and often bragged about it.'\" (\"I'll never forgive her, never!\"  screamed Stephanie.) \"'The twins, Pearl and Doris, were fat, stodgy  girls, who wore five-and-a-halfs in shoes and had twenty-seven-inch  waists.'\" (\"Oh! Won't Merle and Alice be just frantic when they hear?\")  \"'But even they were more interesting than Nellie Clacton, who usually  sat with her mouth open, as if she was trying to catch flies.'\" (\"Does  she mean me?\" gasped Mary Acton indignantly.) \"'Florence Tulliver was  inclined to be snarly, and often said mean things about other people  behind their backs.'\" (\"I'll say something now!\" declared Gertrude  Oliver.) \"'And Annie Ryton was----'\" but here Addie broke off abruptly  and exploded.    \"Go on! Go on!\" commanded the girls.    \"It's too lovely!\" spluttered Addie. \"O--ho--ho! So that's what she  thinks of me, is it?\"    \"Read it, can't you?\"    \"Here, give the paper to me!\"    \"No, no! I'll go on--but--I didn't know my eyes were like faded  gooseberries, and my hair like dried seaweed!\"    \"Has she described herself!\" asked Stephanie.    \"I haven't come to it yet. Oh yes! here we are, farther on: 'Our  heroine, Morvyth Langton, was an unusually----'\"    But here Addie stopped abruptly, for a blazing little fury stood in the  doorway.    \"Addie Knighton, how dare you? How dare you? Give me that paper this  instant!\"    \"No, no! It's much too interesting. Let go! Don't be silly! How can you?  Oh, what a shame!\" as Ulyth in her anger tore the manuscript across and  flung it into the fire.    \"Whew! Now you've gone and done it!\" whistled Rona.    Ulyth was holding down the last flaming fragment with the poker. When it  had expired she turned to the guilty circle. \"Who took my papers from my  bedroom?\"    Her voice was sharp, and her eyes fixed full on Rona.    \"I didn't touch them. I never laid so much as a finger on them,\"  protested the Cuckoo.    \"But you told someone where they were?\"    Rona winked in reply. Yes, alas! winked consciously and deliberately.  (It was well for her that Miss Moseley was not in the room.)    \"I knew you'd got something there,\" she admitted. \"Were you such an  innocent as to think I never saw you scribbling away hard in the early  mornings? Why, I was foxing! I used to watch you while I was snoring,  and nearly died with laughing because you never found me out.\"    If eyes could slay, Ulyth's would have finished Rona at that moment. But  Addie Knighton, whose suspension of mirth had been merely a species of  temporary paralysis, now relapsed into a choking series of guffaws, in  which the others joined boisterously.    \"I can't--get--over--seaweed--and faded gooseberries!\" crowed Addie  hysterically.    \"I don't catch flies with my open mouth!\" shouted Mary Acton, suspending  her knitting in her indignation.    \"Will somebody please measure the twins' waists?\" bleated Christine.    \"I didn't say it was meant for any of you. If the cap fits, put it on.  Listeners hear no good of themselves, and no more do people who read  what isn't intended for them. It serves you all right, so there!\" and  Ulyth flounced out of the room.    She ran straight up to her bedroom, and burst into tears. It was such a  tragi-comedy ending to her literary ambition. She would rather the girls  had been more indignant than that they had laughed so much.    \"I'll never write another line again,\" she resolved; and then she  thought of the binding she had always intended to have on her first  published book, and wept harder.    \"Ulyth,\" said the Cuckoo, stealing in rather shamefacedly, \"I'm really  frightfully sorry if you're riled. I didn't know you cared all that much  about those old papers. I told Addie, as a joke, and she went and poked  them out. I think they were fine. It was a shame to burn them. Can't you  write them over again?\"    \"Never!\" Ulyth replied, wiping her eyes. \"Rona, you don't realize what  damage you've done. There! oh yes, I'll forgive you, but if you want to  keep friends with me, don't go and do anything of the sort again, that's  all!\"    Ulyth felt a little shy of meeting her class-mates after their discovery  of the very unflattering description she had written of them, but the  girls were good-natured and did not bear malice. They treated the whole  affair as an intense joke, and even took to calling one another by the  assumed names of the story. They composed extra portions, including a  lurid description of Ulyth herself, illustrated by rapid sketches on the"]]]
