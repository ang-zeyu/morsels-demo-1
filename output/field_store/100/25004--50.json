It was plain that this hunt, staged upon a large scale, was  not only a means of revenge upon a hated enemy but, also, a sporting  event of outstanding prestige.    Now the grass trees began to show ragged gaps, open spaces between their  clumps, until the forest was only scattered groups and the party the  Terrans had joined walked along a trail cloaked in knee-high, yellow-red  fern growth. Most of the Salariki carried unlit torches, some having four  or five bundled together, as if gorp hunting must be done after  nightfall. And it _was_ fairly late in the afternoon before they topped a  rise of ground and looked out upon one of Sargol's seas.    The water was a dull-metallic gray, broken by great swaths of purple as  if an artist had slapped a brush of color across it in a hit or miss  fashion. Sand of the red grit, lightened by the golden flecks which  glittered in the sun, stretched to the edge of the wavelets breaking with  only languor on the curve of earth. The bulk of islands arose in serried  ranks farther out--crowned with grass trees all rippling under the sea  wind.    They came out upon the beach where one of the purple patches touched the  shore and Dane noted that it left a scummy deposit there. The Terrans  went on to the water's edge. Where it was clear of the purple stuff they  could get a murky glimpse of the bottom, but the scum hid long stretches  of shoreline and outer wave, and Dane wondered if the gorp used it as a  protective covering.    For the moment the Salariki made no move toward the sea which was to be  their hunting ground. Instead the youngest members of the party, some of  whom were adolescents not yet entitled to wear the claw knife of manhood,  spread out along the shore and set industriously to gathering driftwood,  which they brought back to heap on the sand. Dane, watching that harvest,  caught sight of a smoothly polished length. He called Weeks' attention  to the water rounded cylinder.    The oiler's eyes lighted and he stooped to pick it up. Where the other  sticks were from grass trees this was something else. And among the  bleached pile it had the vividness of flame. For it was a strident  scarlet. Weeks turned it over in his hands, running his fingers lovingly  across its perfect grain. Even in this crude state it had beauty. He  stopped the Salarik who had just brought in another armload of wood.    \"This is what?\" he spoke the Trade Lingo haltingly.    The native gazed somewhat indifferently at the branch. \"Tansil,\" he  answered. \"It grows on the islands--\" He made a vague gesture to include  a good section of the western sea before he hurried away.    Weeks now went along the tide line on his own quest, Dane trailing him.  At the end of a quarter hour when a hail summoned them back to the site  of the now lighted fire, they had some ten pieces of the tansil wood  between them. The finds ranged from a three foot section some four  inches in diameter, to some slender twigs no larger than a writing  steelo--but all with high polish, the warm flame coloring. Weeks lashed  them together before he joined the group where Groft was outlining the  technique of gorp hunting for the benefit of the Terrans.    Some two hundred feet away a reef, often awash and stained with the  purple scum, angled out into the sea in a long curve which formed a  natural breakwater. This was the point of attack. But first the purple  film must be removed so that land and sea dwellers could meet on common  terms.    The fire blazed up, eating hungrily into the driftwood. And from it ran  the young Salariki with lighted brands, which at the water's edge they  whirled about their heads and then hurled out onto the purple patches.  Fire arose from the water and ran with frantic speed across the crests of  the low waves, while the Salariki coughed and buried their noses in their  perfume boxes, for the wind drove shoreward an overpowering stench.    Where the cleansing fire had run on the water there was now only the  natural metallic gray of the liquid, the cover was gone. Older Salariki  warriors were choosing torches from those they had brought, doing it with  care. Groft approached the Terrans carrying four.    \"These you use now--\"    What for? Dane wondered. The sky was still sunlit. He held the torch  watching to see how the Salariki made use of them.    Groft led the advance--running lightly out along the reef with agile and  graceful leaps to cross the breaks where the sea hurled in over the rock.  And after him followed the other natives, each with a lighted torch in  hand--the torch they hunkered down to plant firmly in some crevice of the  rock before taking a stand beside that beacon.    The Terrans, less surefooted in the space boots, picked their way along  the same path, wet with spray, wrinkling their noses against the  lingering puffs of the stench from the water.    Following the example of the Salariki they faced seaward--but Dane did  not know what to watch for. Cam had left only the vaguest general  descriptions of gorp and beyond the fact that they were reptilian,  intelligent and dangerous, the Terrans had not been briefed.    Once the warriors had taken up their stand along the reef, the younger  Salariki went into action once more. Lighting more torches at the fire,  they ran out along the line of their elders and flung their torches as  far as they could hurl them into the sea outside the reef.    The gray steel of the water was now yellow with the reflection of the  sinking sun. But that ocher and gold became more brilliant yet as the  torches of the Salariki set blazing up far floating patches of scum. Dane  shielded his eyes against the glare and tried to watch the water, with  some idea that this move must be provocation and what they hunted would  so be driven into view.    He held his sleep rod ready, just as the Salarik on his right had claw  knife in one hand and in the other, open and waiting, the net intended to  entangle and hold fast a victim, binding him for the kill.    But it was at the far tip of the barrier--the post of greatest honor  which Groft had jealously claimed as his, that the gorp struck first. At  a wild shout of defiance Dane half turned to see the Salarik noble cast  his net at sea level and then stab viciously with a well practiced blow.  When he raised his arm for a second thrust, greenish ichor ran from the  blade down his wrist.    \"Dane!\"    Thorson's head jerked around. He saw the vee of ripples headed straight  for the rocks where he balanced.    But he'd have to wait for a better target than a moving wedge of water.  Instinctively he half crouched in the stance of an embattled spaceman,  wishing now that he did have a blaster.    Neither of the Salariki stationed on either side of him made any move and  he guessed that was hunt etiquette. Each man was supposed to face and  kill the monster that challenged him--without assistance. And upon his  skill during the next few minutes might rest the reputation of all  Terrans as far as the natives were concerned.    There was a shadow outline beneath the surface of the metallic water now,  but he could not see well because of the distortion of the murky waves.  He must wait until he was sure.    Then the thing gave a spurt and, only inches beyond the toes of his  boots, a nightmare creature sprang halfway out of the water, pincher  claws as long as his own arms snapping at him. Without being conscious of  his act, he pressed the stud of the sleep rod, aiming in the general  direction of that horror from the sea.    But to his utter amazement the creature did not fall supinely back into  watery world from which it had emerged. Instead those claws snapped  again, this time scrapping across the top of Dane's foot, leaving a  furrow in material the keenest of knives could not have scored.    \"Give it to him!\" That was Rip shouting encouragement from his own place  farther along the reef.    Dane pressed the firing stud again and again. The claws waved as the  monstrosity slavered from a gaping frog's mouth, a mouth which was fanged  with a shark's vicious teeth. It was almost wholly out of the water,  creeping on a crab's many legs, with a clawed upper limb reaching for  him, when suddenly it stopped, its huge head turning from side to side in  the sheltering carapace of scaled natural armor. It settled back as if  crouching for a final spring--a spring which would push Dane into the  ocean.    But that attack never came. Instead the gorp drew in upon itself until it  resembled an unwieldy ball of indestructible armor and there it remained.    The Salariki on either side of Dane let out cries of triumph and edged  closer. One of them twirled his net suggestively, seeing that the Terran  lacked what was to him an essential piece of hunting equipment. Dane  nodded vigorously in agreement and the tough strands swung out in a  skillful cast which engulfed the motionless creature on the reef. But it  was so protected by its scales that there was no opening for the claw  knife. They had made a capture but they could not make a kill.    However, the Salariki were highly delighted. And several abandoned their  posts to help the boys drag the monster ashore where it was pinned down  to the beach by stakes driven through the edges of the net.    But the hunting party was given little time to gloat over this stroke of  fortune. The gorp killed by Groft and the one stunned by Dane were only  the van of an army and within moments the hunters on the reef were  confronted by trouble armed with slashing claws and diabolic fighting  ability.    The battle was anything but one-sided. Dane whirled, as the air was rent  by a shriek of agony, just in time to see one of the Salariki, already  torn by the claws of a gorp, being drawn under the water. It was too late  to save the hunter, though Dane,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#9)"],[1,"-stricken haste of the bearers  and flung to the ground. The accounts of his last words vary according  as they are prompted by hatred or admiration. Some say that he whined  and asked what harm he had deserved, begging for a few days' respite  to pay the troops their largess. The majority say that he offered his  neck to the blow and bade them, 'Come, strike, if it serves the  country's need.' Whatever he said mattered little to his assassins. As  to the actual murderer there is a difference of opinion. Some say it  was Terentius, a reservist,[71] others that his name was Laecanius.  The most common account is that a soldier of the Fifteenth legion, by  name Camurius, pierced his throat with a sword-thrust. The others  foully mangled his arms and legs (his breast was covered) and with  bestial savagery continued to stab the headless corpse. Then they made  for Titus Vinius. Here, too, there is a doubt whether the fear of       42  imminent death strangled his voice, or whether he called out that they  had no mandate from Otho to kill him. He may have invented this in his  terror, or it may have been a confession of his complicity in the  plot. His whole life and reputation give reason to suppose that he was  an accomplice in the crime of which he was the cause. He was brought  to the ground in front of the temple of Julius by a blow on the knee,  and afterwards a common soldier named Julius Carus ran him through  with a sword.    However, Rome found one hero that day. This was Sempronius Densus,      43  a centurion of the Guards, who had been told off by Galba to protect  Piso. Drawing his dagger he faced the armed assassins, flinging their  treason in their teeth, and by his shouts and gestures turned their  attention upon himself, thus enabling Piso to escape despite his  wounds. Piso, reaching the temple of Vesta, was mercifully sheltered  by the verger, who hid him in his lodging. There, no reverence for  this sanctuary but merely his concealment postponed his immediate  death. Eventually, Otho, who was burning to have him killed,[72]  dispatched as special agents, Sulpicius Florus of the British cohorts,  a man whom Galba had recently enfranchised, and Statius Murcus of the  Body Guard. They dragged Piso forth and butchered him on the threshold  of the temple.    FOOTNOTES:        [56] These troops, having no head-quarters in Rome, were put           up in a piazza built by M.

[57] The term primipilaris denotes one who had been the           centurion commanding the first maniple (pilani) of the first           cohort of a legion. He was an officer of great importance,           highly paid, and often admitted to the general's council.           Otho's expedition to Narbonese Gaul (chap. 87) was commanded           by two such 'senior centurions'.        [58] See chap. 6, note 11.        [59] See chap. 6.

[71] The word here used usually means a veteran re-enlisted in           a special corps after his term had expired. It was also           applied at this time in a special sense to a corps of young           knights, who, without losing their status, acted as Galba's           special body-guard in the imperial palace. One of these may           have been the murderer.      OTHO ON THE THRONE    None of his murders pleased Otho so much as this. On Piso's head,       44  as on no other, they say, he gazed with insatiable eyes. This was  possibly the first moment at which he felt relieved of all anxiety,  and free to indulge his glee; or perhaps, in the case of Galba and of  Vinius, the recollection of his treason to the one and of his former  friendship with the other troubled even his unfeeling heart with  gloomy thoughts, whereas, Piso being an enemy and a rival, he  considered it a pious duty to gloat over his murder. Their heads were  fixed on poles and carried along with the standards of the cohorts  side by side with the eagle of the legion.[73] Those who had done the  deed and those who had witnessed it vied with each other in displaying  their bloody hands, all boasting of their share--some falsely, some  truly--as if it were a fine and memorable exploit. Vitellius  subsequently discovered more than 120 petitions demanding rewards for  distinguished services rendered on that day. He gave orders to search  out all the petitioners and put them to death. This was from no  respect for Galba: he merely followed the traditional custom by which  princes secure their present safety and posthumous vengeance.    The senate and people seemed different men. There was a general         45  rush for the camp, every one shouldering his neighbour and trying to  overtake those in front. They heaped insults on Galba, praised the  prudence of the troops, and covered Otho's hand with kisses, their  extravagance varying inversely with their sincerity. Otho rebuffed no  one, and succeeded by his words and looks in moderating the menace of  the soldiers' greed for vengeance. They loudly demanded the execution  of Marius Celsus, the consul-elect, who had remained Galba's faithful  friend to the last. They were as much offended at his efficiency and  honesty as if these had been criminal qualities. What they wanted was  obviously to find a first excuse for plunder and murder and the  destruction of all decent citizens. But Otho had as yet no influence  to prevent crimes: he could only order them. So he simulated anger,  giving instructions for Celsus' arrest, and by promising that he  should meet with a worse penalty, thus rescued him from immediate  death.    The will of the soldiers was now henceforward supreme. The              46  Praetorian Guards chose their own prefects, Plotius Firmus, a man who  had risen from the ranks to the post of Chief of Police,[74] and  joined Otho's side before Galba's fall, and Licinius Proculus, an  intimate friend of Otho, and therefore suspected of furthering his  plans. They made Flavius Sabinus[75] prefect of the city, therein  following Nero's choice, under whom Sabinus had held that post;  besides, most of them had an eye to the fact that he was Vespasian's  brother. An urgent demand arose that the customary fees to centurions  for granting furlough should be abolished, for they constituted a sort  of annual tax upon the common soldier. The result had been that a  quarter of each company could go off on leave or lounge idly about the  barracks, so long as they paid the centurion his fee, nor was there  any one to control either the amount of this impost or the means by  which the soldiers raised the money: highway robbery or menial service  was the usual resort whereby they purchased leisure. Then, again, a  soldier who had money was savagely burdened with work until he should  buy exemption. Thus he soon became impoverished and enervated by  idleness, and returned to his company no longer a man of means and  energy but penniless and lazy. So the process went on. One after  another they became deteriorated by poverty and lax discipline,  rushing blindly into quarrels and mutiny, and, as a last resource,  into civil war. Otho was afraid of alienating the centurions by his  concessions to the rank and file, and promised to pay the annual  furlough-fees out of his private purse. This was indubitably a sound  reform, which good emperors have since established as a regular custom  in the army. The prefect Laco he pretended to banish to an island, but  on his arrival he was stabbed by a reservist[76] whom Otho had  previously dispatched for that purpose. Marcianus Icelus, as being one  of his own freedmen,[77] he sentenced to public execution.    Thus the day was spent in crimes, and worst of all was the joy          47  they caused. The senate was summoned by the urban praetor.[78] The  other magistrates all vied in flattery. The senators arrived  post-haste. They decreed to Otho the powers of the tribunate, the  title of Augustus, and all the imperial prerogatives. Their unanimous  object was to blot out all recollection of former insults; but, as  these had been hurled equally from all sides, they did not, as far as  any one could see, stick in his memory. Whether he had forgotten them  or only postponed punishment, his reign was too short to show. He was  then carried through the still reeking Forum among the "]]]
