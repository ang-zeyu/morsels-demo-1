It is the purpose of the French Heroes' Fund to make this Chateau in  France a complement to Mount Vernon. In it are to be kept records of  Colonial days, as well as those of the present war. There is to be a  room dedicated to the British; one to the Legion; another to the  American Ambulance and still another to aviation. It is also to be made  a home for orphans and for soldiers who have been disabled.    After a collation, we visited the reception room, which contains a  number of old-time engravings, facsimiles of the Declaration of  Independence, a bronze bust of Lafayette, a marble bust of Lafayette and  a bronze bust of Franklin. Overhanging the bed in which Lafayette was  born is a fine portrait of Benjamin Franklin. Although Lafayette died in  Paris, the bed in which he died was brought to the Chateau, and we were  shown this also.    Among other things in the reception room was a large placard with the  heading \"North American United States Constitution Explained\". There was  also a billiard table which looked as if it had seen much service.    I have alluded to this visit to the birthplace of Lafayette in a little  address which I made at Besancon, and which will appear later.    Some photographs of the Commission were taken before leaving. Quite a  large sum was raised among the Commissioners and given to the mayor to  be distributed among the poor of the village.    Our next objective was LePuy, where we arrived at 4:30 P.M. and had  breakfast, so-called, although the detour to the birthplace of Lafayette  made us about ten hours late. We were met by the prefect, the mayor and  the president of the Chamber of Commerce. We visited a church built on  the top of a rock, the ascent to which was by three hundred  perpendicular steps, two feet wide. It was said that these steps were  built in this way as an opportunity for penance, it being a very hard  operation to climb to the top. Some of our people made the ascent,  myself among the number. When we reached the top we were rewarded by a  magnificent view of the surrounding country. At the highest point is a  statue of the Virgin Mary, made of Russian cannon, recast after capture  by Napoleon.    While at LePuy we were shown the only spot where the immortal Caesar was  defeated; otherwise his reign was triumphant.    Leaving LePuy we arrived at St. Etienne at midnight, after a most  perilous ride. A banquet had been planned at St. Etienne, but had been  postponed. On the following day we visited the establishment of the  Giron Brothers, ribbon manufacturers. This establishment dates back to  the very early part of the Nineteenth century, and at present has two  thousand employees, nearly all women. Its trade is largely with the  United States. On account of the labor situation the factory is working  only half time. The men are at war, the women in the munition plants and  factories. Wage earners make four, and not to exceed five, francs per  day and consider themselves well paid.    [Illustration: Monastery of St. Michael at Le Puy.]    We also visited the silk manufacturing plant of P. Staron, Jr. We saw  here the most beautiful silks and brocades. Among other fine things were  ribbons in the Fleur de Lis design, the national flower of France. On  account of the war the employees at work were few.    Here we met Mr. Wm. H. Hunt, American consul and the last appointee of  President McKinley before his untimely death.    At St. Etienne I went into a barbershop to get a shave, sat down in the  chair, and a youth not over twelve years of age started to lather me. I  supposed, of course, that he was getting me ready for the barber, who  would soon appear; instead of that he proceeded with the work himself.  He spoke a little English, telling me his father was in the army and he  was running the business. He gave me one of the best shaves I received  in France.    My next experience with the youth of France was with a boy chauffeur.  Our military automobiles had disappeared for the time being and I  engaged a taxicab.    [Illustration: Silk Tapestry Menu Used at Dinner to the Commission at  St. Etienne.]    The boy who ran this was not over eleven or twelve years of age, but he  did the work well.    On the evening of September 19th, we were given a banquet by the Chamber  of Commerce at St. Etienne. It was a very successful affair. I met here  Theodore Laurent, a prominent steel manufacturer whom I had met at  Brussels in 1911, when the American Iron and Steel Institute made its  famous visit to England and the continent. At this banquet we met also  the prefect and other notables.          VI.    A GREAT MUNITIONS PLANT      Wednesday, September 20th, we left St. Etienne for St. Charmond to visit  the plant at which Mr. Laurent is director general. His company owns  several plants, this being the most important and one of the oldest  manufactories of cannons and munitions in France. We met here Colonel  Rimialho, who is the inventor of the seventy-five-millimeter gun and has  general charge of the artillery and munitions manufactured in France.  The plant at the present time makes only cannon and munitions. There are  no blast furnaces at the works. They use the Siemens-Martin process and  melt about seventy-five to eighty per cent. scrap. They also use a  quantity of vanadium steel imported from America and furnished by the  American Vanadium Company. We were told that France produces five  hundred thousand shells or projectiles daily. This plant turns out  twenty-eight thousand of this number, besides one hundred and twenty  thousand fuses, or detonators. Before the war the works produced one  hundred and twenty thousand annually; they now make this number daily.  They have sixteen thousand employees, five thousand of whom are women.  We saw here a number of Amazonian Junos doing men's work while wearing  leather aprons, and were informed that they were fully as efficient as  men and are paid the same wages.    We saw at these works a number of the now famous \"caterpillars\", an  armored car moving on a broad track which it lays down as it goes. This  machine was invented by an American, and I have seen it at work on the  Pacific coast.    After an examination of the works, we were taken to the suburbs of the  town and a special test of the big guns was made for our benefit, the  firing going to the hill. We were instructed to put cotton in our ears  and keep our mouths open, and faithfully observed this injunction. The  seventy-five millimeter fired twelve shots in thirty-six seconds, by my  watch. The target was brought to us afterwards and we were shown that  the projectiles went straight through without a side dent. We were also  treated to the firing of some of the very large guns, and by the time  this was over I was ready to visit an ear doctor, if there had been one  convenient.    When this interesting exhibition was ended we were entertained for the  first time in a real French home. Mr. Laurent took us to his home and  gave us a luncheon. We met Mrs. Laurent and two daughters, but the four  sons had joined the colors. Two of them had already lost their lives in  battle.    We met at this luncheon Sir Thomas Barclay, of London, who has taken an  active part in the humanitarian work of England, with headquarters in  Paris.    [Illustration: Col. Rimailho with 155-mm. Gun (upper) and Famous 75-mm.  Gun (lower) Perfected by Him.]    The party reached Lyons at 6:20 P.M. by military automobiles and at once  had a conference with Mayor Heriot. It appeared that there was some  discussion between this official and the president of the Chamber of  Commerce as to who should head the entertaining. We were greatly  impressed with M. Heriot, but he took a night train for Paris and we  were left in the hands of the Chamber of Commerce. We were given a  reception by this body, and spent the night at Lyons.    On the afternoon of the following day we visited the textile museum. We  also visited the government munitions plant, which was formerly the  Lyons fair, but had been taken over by the government, stripped of  everything and made the most efficient munitions plant in all France. We  met Thadee Natanson, Director General. He is a wonderful character. Our  impression of him was very good and he later addressed us in strong but  broken English and said he hoped he would learn something from us, and,  if we had, in visiting the plant, any suggestions to make, he wanted to  hear them. The plant employs twelve thousand, one-half women and the  remainder men. The product is shells, cartridges, fuses, and detonators.  We were told that this is the only place in France where a projectile is  entirely completed, ready to fire. We met Andre Foulcher, engineer of  the plant. The production of this plant is twenty-eight thousand shells  and twenty-five thousand fuses daily. We were told that here the women  were more efficient than the men. At these works we were taken into the  most dangerous part of the plant, where frequent explosions have  occurred.    We met here George Martin, editor of the Paris \"Progress\", and also  Capt. J. Barret, who had recently lost in the army his only son.    Our tour of Lyons included the Lyons electric light and gas plant. On  this side trip we met an entire regiment of Algerian soldiers, black as  the traditional ace of spades, but fine specimens of manhood. Their  uniforms were almost identical with the uniform worn by our soldiers in  the Civil War. They wore light blue overcoats, such as Governor Tod  furnished the first company which marched from Youngstown.    Over the door of the gas plant were the words \"Defense D'Entrer\", with  skull and cross bones underneath and with the further words, \"Danger de  Mort\".    At this place we received our first home letters, which were very  welcome.    In the evening we were given a banquet by the Chamber of Commerce.

South to Florida; west to Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Indian       Territory.    =Habit.=--A medium-sized tree, 25-40 feet high, with a trunk diameter of  8-20 inches, attaining much greater dimensions southward; extremely  variable in outline; the lower branches usually nearly horizontal, the  upper ascending; head when young very regular, narrow-based, close and  conical; in old trees frequently rather open, wide-spreading, ragged,  roundish or flattened. In very exposed situations, especially along the  seacoast, the trunk sometimes rises a foot or two and then develops  horizontally, forming a curiously contorted lateral head. Under such  conditions it occasionally becomes a dwarf tree 2-3 feet high, with  wide-spreading branches and a very dense dome; spray close, foliage a  sombre green, sometimes tinged with a rusty brownish-red; wood pale red,  aromatic.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk light reddish-brown, fibrous, shredding off, now  and then, in long strips, exposing the smooth brown inner bark; season's  shoots green.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Leaf-buds naked, minute. Leaves dull green or  brownish-red, of two kinds:    1. Scale-like, mostly opposite, each pair overlapping the pair above,  4-ranked, ovate, acute, sometimes bristle-tipped, more or less convex,  obscurely glandular.    2. Scattered, not overlapping, narrowly lanceolate or needle-shaped,  sharp-pointed, spreading. The second form is more common in young trees,  sometimes comprising all the foliage, but is often found on trees of all  ages, sometimes aggregated in dense masses.    =Inflorescence.=--Early May. Flowers terminating short branches, sterile  and fertile, more commonly on separate trees, often on the same tree;  anthers in opposite pairs; ovuliferous scales in opposite pairs,  slightly spreading, acute or obtuse; ovules 1-4.    =Fruit.=--Berry-like from the coalescence of the fleshy cone-scales, the  extremities of which are often visible, roundish, the size of a small  pea, dark blue beneath a whitish bloom, 1-4-seeded.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; prefers sunny  slopes and a loamy soil, but grows well in poor, thin soils and upon  wind-swept sites; young plants increase in height 1-2 feet yearly and  have a very formal, symmetrical outline; old trees often become  irregular and picturesque, and grow very slowly; a long-lived tree;  usually obtainable in nurseries and from collectors, but must frequently  be transplanted to be moved with safety. If a ball of earth can be  retained about the roots of wild plants, they can often be moved  successfully. There are horticultural forms distinguished by a slender  weeping or distorted habit, and by variegated bluish or yellowish  foliage, occasionally found in American nurseries. The type is usually  propagated from the seed, the horticultural forms from cuttings or by  grafting.    [Illustration: PLATE XIII.--Juniperus Virginiana.]      1.
