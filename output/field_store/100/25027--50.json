But how can the syllable be known if the letter  remains unknown? In learning to read as children, we are first taught  the letters and then the syllables. And in music, the notes, which  are the letters, have a much more distinct meaning to us than the  combination of them.    Once more, then, we must ask the meaning of the statement, that  'Knowledge is right opinion, accompanied by explanation or definition.'  Explanation may mean, (1) the reflection or expression of a man's  thoughts--but every man who is not deaf and dumb is able to express his  thoughts--or (2) the enumeration of the elements of which anything is  composed. A man may have a true opinion about a waggon, but then, and  then only, has he knowledge of a waggon when he is able to enumerate  the hundred planks of Hesiod. Or he may know the syllables of the name  Theaetetus, but not the letters; yet not until he knows both can he be  said to have knowledge as well as opinion. But on the other hand he may  know the syllable 'The' in the name Theaetetus, yet he may be mistaken  about the same syllable in the name Theodorus, and in learning to read  we often make such mistakes. And even if he could write out all the  letters and syllables of your name in order, still he would only have  right opinion. Yet there may be a third meaning of the definition,  besides the image or expression of the mind, and the enumeration of the  elements, viz. (3) perception of difference.    For example, I may see a man who has eyes, nose, and mouth;--that will  not distinguish him from any other man. Or he may have a snub-nose and  prominent eyes;--that will not distinguish him from myself and you and  others who are like me. But when I see a certain kind of snub-nosedness,  then I recognize Theaetetus. And having this sign of difference, I have  knowledge. But have I knowledge or opinion of this difference; if I  have only opinion I have not knowledge; if I have knowledge we assume  a disputed term; for knowledge will have to be defined as right opinion  with knowledge of difference.    And so, Theaetetus, knowledge is neither perception nor true opinion,  nor yet definition accompanying true opinion. And I have shown that the  children of your brain are not worth rearing. Are you still in labour,  or have you brought all you have to say about knowledge to the birth? If  you have any more thoughts, you will be the better for having got rid of  these; or if you have none, you will be the better for not fancying that  you know what you do not know. Observe the limits of my art, which, like  my mother's, is an art of midwifery; I do not pretend to compare with  the good and wise of this and other ages.    And now I go to meet Meletus at the porch of the King Archon; but  to-morrow I shall hope to see you again, Theodorus, at this place.    ...    I. The saying of Theaetetus, that 'Knowledge is sensible perception,'  may be assumed to be a current philosophical opinion of the age. 'The  ancients,' as Aristotle (De Anim.) says, citing a verse of Empedocles,  'affirmed knowledge to be the same as perception.' We may now examine  these words, first, with reference to their place in the history of  philosophy, and secondly, in relation to modern speculations.    (a) In the age of Socrates the mind was passing from the object to the  subject. The same impulse which a century before had led men to form  conceptions of the world, now led them to frame general notions of the  human faculties and feelings, such as memory, opinion, and the like. The  simplest of these is sensation, or sensible perception, by which Plato  seems to mean the generalized notion of feelings and impressions of  sense, without determining whether they are conscious or not.    The theory that 'Knowledge is sensible perception' is the antithesis of  that which derives knowledge from the mind (Theaet.), or which assumes  the existence of ideas independent of the mind (Parm.). Yet from their  extreme abstraction these theories do not represent the opposite poles  of thought in the same way that the corresponding differences would  in modern philosophy. The most ideal and the most sensational have a  tendency to pass into one another; Heracleitus, like his great successor  Hegel, has both aspects. The Eleatic isolation of Being and the Megarian  or Cynic isolation of individuals are placed in the same class by Plato  (Soph.); and the same principle which is the symbol of motion to one  mind is the symbol of rest to another. The Atomists, who are sometimes  regarded as the Materialists of Plato, denied the reality of sensation.  And in the ancient as well as the modern world there were reactions from  theory to experience, from ideas to sense. This is a point of view from  which the philosophy of sensation presented great attraction to the  ancient thinker. Amid the conflict of ideas and the variety of opinions,  the impression of sense remained certain and uniform. Hardness,  softness, cold, heat, etc. are not absolutely the same to different  persons, but the art of measuring could at any rate reduce them all  to definite natures (Republic). Thus the doctrine that knowledge is  perception supplies or seems to supply a firm standing ground. Like the  other notions of the earlier Greek philosophy, it was held in a very  simple way, without much basis of reasoning, and without suggesting the  questions which naturally arise in our own minds on the same subject.    (b) The fixedness of impressions of sense furnishes a link of connexion  between ancient and modern philosophy. The modern thinker often repeats  the parallel axiom, 'All knowledge is experience.' He means to say that  the outward and not the inward is both the original source and the final  criterion of truth, because the outward can be observed and analyzed;  the inward is only known by external results, and is dimly perceived  by each man for himself. In what does this differ from the saying of  Theaetetus? Chiefly in this--that the modern term 'experience,' while  implying a point of departure in sense and a return to sense, also  includes all the processes of reasoning and imagination which have  intervened. The necessary connexion between them by no means affords a  measure of the relative degree of importance which is to be ascribed to  either element. For the inductive portion of any science may be small,  as in mathematics or ethics, compared with that which the mind has  attained by reasoning and reflection on a very few facts.    II. The saying that 'All knowledge is sensation' is identified by Plato  with the Protagorean thesis that 'Man is the measure of all things.'  The interpretation which Protagoras himself is supposed to give of these  latter words is: 'Things are to me as they appear to me, and to you as  they appear to you.' But there remains still an ambiguity both in the  text and in the explanation, which has to be cleared up. Did Protagoras  merely mean to assert the relativity of knowledge to the human mind? Or  did he mean to deny that there is an objective standard of truth?    These two questions have not been always clearly distinguished; the  relativity of knowledge has been sometimes confounded with uncertainty.  The untutored mind is apt to suppose that objects exist independently  of the human faculties, because they really exist independently of the  faculties of any individual. In the same way, knowledge appears to be  a body of truths stored up in books, which when once ascertained are  independent of the discoverer. Further consideration shows us that these  truths are not really independent of the mind; there is an adaptation of  one to the other, of the eye to the object of sense, of the mind to the  conception. There would be no world, if there neither were nor ever  had been any one to perceive the world. A slight effort of reflection  enables us to understand this; but no effort of reflection will enable  us to pass beyond the limits of our own faculties, or to imagine the  relation or adaptation of objects to the mind to be different from that  of which we have experience. There are certain laws of language and  logic to which we are compelled to conform, and to which our ideas  naturally adapt themselves; and we can no more get rid of them than we  can cease to be ourselves. The absolute and infinite, whether explained  as self-existence, or as the totality of human thought, or as the  Divine nature, if known to us at all, cannot escape from the category of  relation.    But because knowledge is subjective or relative to the mind, we are  not to suppose that we are therefore deprived of any of the tests or  criteria of truth. One man still remains wiser than another, a  more accurate observer and relater of facts, a truer measure of the  proportions of knowledge. The nature of testimony is not altered, nor  the verification of causes by prescribed methods less certain. Again,  the truth must often come to a man through others, according to the  measure of his capacity and education. But neither does this affect the  testimony, whether written or oral, which he knows by experience to  be trustworthy. He cannot escape from the laws of his own mind; and  he cannot escape from the further accident of being dependent for his  knowledge on others. But still this is no reason why he should always be  in doubt; of many personal, of many historical and scientific facts he  may be absolutely assured. And having such a mass of acknowledged truth  in the mathematical and physical, not to speak of the moral sciences,  the moderns have certainly no reason to acquiesce in the statement  that truth is appearance only, or that there is no difference between  appearance and truth.    The relativity of knowledge is a truism to us, but was a great  psychological discovery in the fifth century before"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#9)"],[1,"of speech and unrestrained in fury, let  no evil word any more be in thy heart, nor evil work, but  let me see thee eat and drink as of old. And the Achaeans  will make thee ready all things without fail, a ship and  chosen oarsmen, that thou mayest come the quicker to fair  Pylos, to seek tidings of thy noble father.'    Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying, 'Antinous, in no  wise in your proud company can I sup in peace, and make  merry with a quiet mind. Is it a little thing, ye wooers,  that in time past ye wasted many good things of my getting,  while as yet I was a child? But now that I am a man grown,  and learn the story from the lips of others, and my spirit  waxeth within me, I will seek to let loose upon you evil  fates, as I may, going either to Pylos for help, or abiding  here in this township. Yea, I will go, nor vain shall the  voyage be whereof I speak; a passenger on another's ship go  I, for I am not to have a ship nor oarsmen of mine own; so  in your wisdom ye have thought it for the better.'    He spake and snatched his hand from out the hand of  Antinous, lightly, and all the while the wooers were busy  feasting through the house; and they mocked him and sharply  taunted him, and thus would some proud youth speak:    'In very truth Telemachus planneth our destruction. He will  bring a rescue either from sandy Pylos, or even it may be  from Sparta, so terribly is he set on slaying us. Or else  he will go to Ephyra, a fruitful land, to fetch a poisonous  drug that he may cast it into the bowl and make an end of  all of us.'    And again another proud youth would say: 'Who knows but  that he himself if he goes hence on the hollow ship, may  perish wandering far from his friends, even as Odysseus? So  should we have yet more ado, for then must we divide among  us all his substance, and moreover give the house to his  mother to possess it, and to him whosoever should wed her.'    So spake they; but he stepped down into the vaulted  treasure-chamber of his father, a spacious room, where gold  and bronze lay piled, and raiment in coffers, and fragrant  olive oil in plenty. And there stood casks of sweet wine  and old, full of the unmixed drink divine, all orderly  ranged by the wall, ready if ever Odysseus should come  home, albeit after travail and much pain. And the  close-fitted doors, the folding doors, were shut, and night  and day there abode within a dame in charge, who guarded  all in the fulness of her wisdom, Eurycleia, daughter of  Ops son of Peisenor. Telemachus now called her into the  chamber and spake unto her, saying:    'Mother, come draw off for me sweet wine in jars, the  choicest next to that thou keepest mindful ever of that  ill-fated one, Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, if perchance  he may come I know not whence, having avoided death and the  fates. So fill twelve jars, and close each with his lid,  and pour me barley-meal into well-sewn skins, and let there  be twenty measures of the grain of bruised barley-meal. Let  none know this but thyself! As for these things let them  all be got together; for in the evening I will take them  with me, at the time that my mother hath gone to her upper  chamber and turned her thoughts to sleep. Lo, to Sparta I  go and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of my dear father's  return, if haply I may hear thereof.'    So spake he, and the good nurse Eurycleia wailed aloud, and  making lament spake to him winged words: 'Ah, wherefore,  dear child, hath such a thought arisen in thine heart? How  shouldst thou fare over wide lands, thou that art an only  child and well-beloved? As for him he hath perished,  Odysseus of the seed of Zeus, far from his own country in  the land of strangers. And yonder men, so soon as thou art  gone, will devise mischief against thee thereafter, that  thou mayest perish by guile, and they will share among them  all this wealth of thine. Nay, abide here, settled on thine  own lands: thou hast no need upon the deep unharvested to  suffer evil and go wandering.'    Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: 'Take heart,  nurse, for lo, this my purpose came not but of a god. But  swear to tell no word thereof to my dear mother, till at  least it shall be the eleventh or twelfth day from hence,  or till she miss me of herself, and hear of my departure,  that so she may not mar her fair face with her tears.'    Thus he spake, and the old woman sware a great oath by the  gods not to reveal it. But when she had sworn and done that  oath, straightway she drew off the wine for him in jars,  and poured barley-meal into well-sewn skins, and Telemachus  departed to the house and consorted with the wooers.    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other  thoughts. In the likeness of Telemachus she went all  through the city, and stood by each one of the men and  spake her saying, and bade them gather at even by the swift  ship. Furthermore, she craved a swift ship of Noemon,  famous son of Phronius, and right gladly he promised it.    Now the sun sank and all the ways were darkened. Then at  length she let drag the swift ship to the sea and stored  within it all such tackling as decked ships carry. And she  moored it at the far end of the harbour and the good  company was gathered together, and the goddess cheered on  all.    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other  thoughts. She went on her way to the house of divine  Odysseus; and there she shed sweet sleep upon the wooers  and made them distraught in their drinking, and cast the  cups from their hands. And they arose up to go to rest  throughout the city, nor sat they yet a long while, for  slumber was falling on their eyelids. Now grey eyed Athene  spake unto Telemachus, and called him from out the  fair-lying halls, taking the likeness of Mentor, both in  fashion and in voice:    'Telemachus, thy goodly-greaved companions are sitting  already at their oars, it is thy despatch they are  awaiting. Nay then, let us go, that we delay them not long  from the way.'    Therewith Pallas Athene led the way quickly, and he  followed hard in the steps of the goddess. Now when they  had come down to the ship and to the sea, they found the  long-haired youths of the company on the shore; and the  mighty prince Telemachus spake among them:    'Come hither, friends, let us carry the corn on board, for  all is now together in the room, and my mother knows nought  thereof, nor any of the maidens of the house: one woman  only heard my saying.'    Thus he spake and led the way, and they went with him. So  they brought all and stowed it in the decked ship,  according to the word of the dear son of Odysseus. Then  Telemachus climbed the ship, and Athene went before him,  and behold, she sat her down in the stern, and near her sat  Telemachus. And the men loosed the hawsers and climbed on  board themselves and sat down upon the benches. And  grey-eyed Athene sent them a favourable gale, a fresh West  Wind, singing over the wine-dark sea.    And Telemachus called unto his company and bade them lay  hands on the tackling, and they hearkened to his call. So  they raised the mast of pine tree and set it in the hole of  the cross plank, and made it fast with forestays, and  hauled up the white sails with twisted ropes of oxhide. And  the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave  seethed loudly round the stem of the running ship, and she  fleeted over the wave, accomplishing her path. Then they  made all fast in the swift black ship, and set mixing bowls  brimmed with wine, and poured drink offering to the  deathless gods that are from everlasting, and in chief to  the grey eyed daughter of Zeus. So all night long and  through the dawn the ship cleft her way.        Book III      Nestor entertains Telemachus at Pylos and tells him how the    Greeks departed from Troy; and sends him for further    information to Sparta.    Now the sun arose and left the lovely mere, speeding to the  brazen heaven, to give light to the immortals and to mortal  men on the earth, the graingiver, and they reached Pylos,  the stablished castle of Neleus. There the people were  doing sacrifice on the sea shore, slaying black bulls  without spot to the dark-haired god, the shaker of the  earth. Nine companies there were, and five hundred men sat  in each, and in every company they held nine bulls ready to  hand. Just as they had tasted the inner parts, and were  burning the slices of the thighs on the altar to the god,  the others were bearing straight to land, and brailed up  the sails of the gallant ship, and moored her, and  themselves came forth. And Telemachus too stept forth from  the ship, and Athene led the way. And the goddess,  grey-eyed Athene, spake first to him, saying:    'Telemachus, thou needst not now be abashed, no, not one  whit. For to this very end didst thou sail over the deep,  that thou mightest hear tidings of thy father, even where  the earth closed over him, and what manner of death he met.  But come now, go straight to Nestor, tamer of horses: let  us learn what counsel he hath in the secret of his heart.  And beseech him thyself that he may give unerring answer;  and he will not lie to thee, for he is very wise.'    The wise Telemachus answered, saying: 'Mentor, and how  shall I go, how shall I greet him, I, who am untried in  words of wisdom? Moreover a young man may well be abashed  to question an elder.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:  'Telemachus, thou shalt bethink thee of somewhat in thine  own breast, and somewhat the god will give thee to say. For  thou, methinks, of all men wert not born and bred without  the will of the gods.'    So spake Pallas Athene and led the way quickly; and he  followed hard in the steps of the goddess. And they came to  the gathering and the session of the men of Pylos. There  was Nestor seated with his sons, and round him his company  making ready the feast, and roasting some of the flesh and"]]]
