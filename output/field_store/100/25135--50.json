But when the  believers are called upon to go through such bitter ordeals they have the  Faith to sustain them, the love of their Baha'i friends to comfort them,  and the glorious words of Baha'u'llah regarding immortality to give them  confidence and courage. Blessed are we, indeed, even in the midst of our  greatest trials.\"            104: INHERITANCE (DIVISION OF)      \"To divide the inheritance as it is prescribed by Baha'u'llah we have to  divide it into 2,520 shares. But we can also divide it into 42 shares.  Then every one of the beneficiaries will take so many of these shares.  These numbers form like a highest denominator for the different fractions  which represent the shares of the different individuals that will benefit  in case of intestacy. In case of the non-existence of one class of  inheritors the Aqdas mentions how it should be divided. As a general rule  a part goes to the House of Justice, a part to the children.\"            105: INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE (WHOLE QUESTION OF)      \"Regarding the whole question of an International Language and its  relation to the Faith: We, as Baha'is, are very anxious to see a universal  auxiliary tongue adopted as soon as possible; we are not the protagonists  of any one language to fill this post. If the governments of the world  agree on an existing language, or a constructed, new tongue, to be used  internationally, we would heartily support it because we desire to see  this step in the unification of the human race take place as soon as  possible.    \"Esperanto has been in wide use, more so than any similar language, all  over the world, and the Baha'is have been encouraged by both the Master  and the Guardian to learn it and to translate Baha'i literature into it.  We cannot be sure it will be the chosen language of the future; but as it  is the one which has spread most, both East and West, we should certainly  continue to cooperate with its members learn to speak it, and translate  Baha'i literature into it.\"            106: ISLAM      \"Islam attained a very high spiritual state, but Western scholars are  prone to judging it by Christian standards. One cannot call one World  Faith superior to another, as they all come from God; they are  progressive, each suited to certain needs of the time.\"            107: JESUS (VIRGIN BIRTH OF)      \"With regard to your question concerning the Virgin Birth of Jesus; on  this point, as on several others, the Baha'i teachings are in full  agreement with the doctrines of the Catholic Church. In the Kitab-i-Iqan  (Book of Certitude) page 56, and in a few other Tablets still unpublished,  Baha'u'llah confirms, however indirectly, the Catholic conception of the  Virgin Birth. Also 'Abdu'l-Baha in 'Some Answered Questions', Chap. 12,  page 73, explicitly states that Christ found existence through the spirit  of God which statement necessarily implies, when reviewed in the light of  the text, that Jesus was not the son of Joseph.\"    \"We believe that Christ only was conceived immaculately. His brothers and  sisters would have been born in the natural way and conceived naturally.\"            108: LIFE AFTER DEATH      \"Those who have never had any opportunity of hearing of the Faith but who  lived good lives will no doubt be treated with the greatest love and mercy  in the next world and reap their full reward.\"            109: LOVE (TURN TO BAHA'I BROTHERS AND SISTERS)      \"Turn to your Baha'i brothers and sisters, who are living with you in the  kingdom. Indeed, the believers have not yet fully learned to draw on each  other's love for strength and consolation in time of need. The Cause of  God is endowed with tremendous powers, and the reason the believers do not  gain more from it is because they have not learned to duly draw these  mighty forces of love and strength and harmony generated by the Faith.\"            110: LOVE, CUSTODIANS OF (WORLD EXCEEDINGLY DARK)      \"The friends must, at all times, bear in mind that they are, in a way,  like soldiers under attack. The world is at present in an exceedingly dark  condition spiritually; hatred and prejudice of every sort are literally  tearing it to pieces. We, on the other hand, are the custodians of the  opposite forces, the forces of love, of unity, of peace and integration,  and we must continually be on our guard, whether as individuals or as an  Assembly or Community, lest through us these destructive, negative forces  enter into our midst. In other words, we must beware lest the darkness of  society become reflected in our acts and attitudes, perhaps all  unconsciously. Love for each other, the deep sense that we are a new  organism, the dawn-breakers of a new World Order, must constantly animate  our Baha'i lives, and we must pray to be protected from the contamination  of society which is so diseased with prejudice.\"            111: LOVE--UNITY (THE GREATEST NEED)      \"The greatest need it seems everywhere inside the Cause is to impress upon  the friends the need for love among them. There is a tendency to mix up  the functions of the Administration and try to apply it in individual  relationships, which is abortive, because the Assembly is a nascent House  of Justice and is supposed to administer, according to the Teachings, the  affairs of the Community. But individuals towards each other are governed  by love, unity, forgiveness and a sin-covering eye. Once the friends grasp  this they will get along much better, but they keep playing Spiritual  Assembly to each other and expect the Assembly to behave like an  individual.\"            112: MANIFESTATION--IN 1000 YEARS (ORGANIC UNITY)      \"As to the meaning of the quotation, 'My fears are for Him Who will be  sent down unto you after Me,' this refers to the Manifestation who is to  come after a thousand or more years, who like all previous Messengers of  God will be subjected to persecutions, but will eventually triumph over  them. For men of ill-will have been and will always continue to be in this  world, unless mankind reaches a state of complete and absolute  perfection--a condition which is not only improbable but actually  impossible to attain. The fundamental difference, however, between this  Dispensation and all previous ones is this, that in this Revelation the  possibility of permanent schism between the followers of the Prophet has  been prevented through the direct and explicit instructions providing for  the necessary instruments designed to maintain the organic unity of the  body of the Faithful.\"            113: MANIFESTATIONS (THE PHRASE--\"HIS HOLINESS\")      \"In Persian it is impolite not to use the word Hadrat before the name of  the Prophet, so that strictly speaking, a proper translation should always  have 'His Holiness Moses' etc.; however, as this seems peculiar in  English, and not in the best usage of our language, he feels it can be  dispensed with. Pronouns referring to the Manifestation, or the Master,  should, however, invariably be capitalized.\"            114: MANIFESTATIONS (RETURN OF THE QUALITIES)      \"The reflection of the qualities of holy souls can take place at any time;  it is not confined to the period when the Manifestation is on earth.\"            115: MANIFESTATIONS (SIGNIFICANCE OF THE REMAINS OF THE PROPHETS)      \"There is no special physical significance in the remains of the Prophets  or relics of Their Persons. But there is a profound spiritual significance  in the sense that Their dust was the physical mirror of the greatness of  God. In other words we know God through His Prophets, Who have bodies;  these bodies--Their very dust--are precious through association. It is  natural for people to be touched by a lock of hair or some token of one  they loved; how much more should we treasure and feel moved by a relic of  the Beloved of God?    \"The Bab has told us to bury the dead in silk (if possible) in coffins of  crystal. Why? Because the body, though now dust, was once exalted by the  immortal soul of man! The portrait of the Bab should be regarded as an  inestimable privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were  denied a glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on.\"    \"The atoms of the Prophets are just atoms, like all others, but the  association of this great spiritual power with them leaves in the place  they are laid to rest a spiritual atmosphere, if one can use this  expression. They are, no doubt, endowed with a tremendous spiritual  influence and far-reaching power. But the physical character of their  atoms are not different from other people's, any more than their bodies  and physical functions are different.\"            116: MANIFESTATIONS (STATION OF)      \"The Manifestations no doubt had some consciousness of their station, but  what the nature of that consciousness was we do not know.\"            117: MARRIAGE, BAHA'I      \"In regard to your question concerning the nature and character of Baha'i  marriage.

So Shoghi Effendi wishes you to  concentrate upon having the book translated only into Urdu.    [From the Guardian:]    I wish you to concentrate your efforts on the completion of the Urdu  version of Dr. Esslemont's book, and to take the necessary step for its  early publication. I shall be only too glad to assist financially in its  printing as soon as its translation is completed. I also desire to stress  the paramount importance of following up the valuable work accomplished by  Mrs. Kehler and which I hope other international Baha'i teachers will  reinforce. How vast is the field and how small the number of competent  teachers! Baha'u'llah will however bless and crown our efforts with  success if we persevere and labour with unabated confidence and vigour.    April 5, 1932          Need of Baha'i Teachers all over the World      He sincerely hopes that as a result of her (Mrs. Kehler's) trip the Cause  will make a great progress in India and many souls will be drawn into the  Cause. It was surely very nice and wise on the part of the National  Assembly to appoint Mr. Pritam Singh to travel with her and help her make  openings into intellectual circles. It is unfortunate, however, that she  cannot stay long in every centre and make really confirmed believers such  as she did in certain centres in Australia. But perhaps the National  Assembly will attend to that task and keeping in touch with persons she  will interest, and gradually make them embrace the Faith and lend a help  towards its progress. We need teachers in every part of the world, and as  those who are in active service are few we should create some from the  material we have. It is the work of the N.S.A. to attend to such matters  and develop some of our young Baha'is into competent teachers. Baha'u'llah  and the New Era to be Translated into Urdu & Hindi    In a previous letter I informed you on behalf of Shoghi Effendi that as we  already have a translation of Dr. Esslemont's book into Gujrati, you  concentrate your efforts on having it rendered only into Urdu, so that the  work may soon be completed and published.    [From the Guardian:]    I trust you have by now taken the necessary steps for a prompt and careful  translation of the book into Urdu. This service will, I am sure, be an  added blessing to the masses of India, whom you are striving so devotedly  and energetically to arouse and teach. May it prove a prelude to an  intensive and fruitful teaching campaign that shall bring in its wake  enlightenment, peace and hope to the distracted multitudes of that  agitated country.    April 12, 1932    Even though we can refer to a non-Baha'i when we have no one among the  friends to undertake a proper work of translation, yet it is always  preferable to have it accomplished by a person who is imbued with the  spirit and is already familiar with the different expressions of Baha'i  conceptions unfamiliar to a non-Baha'i. Shoghi Effendi wishes him success  and will pray for his guidance.    Mrs. Ransom Kehler is now in Haifa taking some rest before starting for  Persia, where she expects to stay a few months. Shoghi Effendi was very  glad to hear of her great success in India. He hopes that she will after  Persia pay another visit to that country and resume the work she has  started. She is surely a very competent teacher and well versed in the  Writings.    [From the Guardian:]    I trust and pray that you will be enabled to start promptly the  publication of the Hindi translation on one hand, and to ensure, on the  other, the early completion of the Urdu version, both of which, I feel are  indispensable preliminaries to an intensive teaching campaign among the  great masses of the Indian people. I am confident that the publication of  the Gujrati version together with these and the Burmese translations, will  reinforce the impetus which the projected visit of Mrs. Kehler to India  next autumn will lend to the onward march of our beloved Cause in India.  May the Almighty reinforce your labours and bless your high endeavours.    May 31, 1932    He is very glad to know that the different translations of Dr. Esslemont's  book, that you have undertaken to have made, are progressing rapidly. He  sincerely hopes that before long they will be passed through the press and  be ready for distribution.    Even though the book was written by a Christian and was meant to be for  people of that Faith to read, yet it is a very fine presentation of the  teachings as a whole and might prove interesting to other people as well.    Shoghi Effendi surely hopes that before long the Cause may produce  scholars that would write books which would be far deeper and more  universal in scope, but for the present this is the best we possess to  give a general idea as to the history and teachings of the Faith to new  seekers. After reading this they get the necessary introduction to delve  more deeply into the fundamental tenets such as are explained in the Iqan.    Shoghi Effendi hopes that these books will greatly stimulate the teaching  work in India and become the cause of guidance to many sincere souls.          Passing Away of the Greatest Holy Leaf      The Guardian wishes me also to thank you for your kind words of sympathy  in connection with the passing away of the Greatest Holy Leaf. This great  loss will be felt by every Baha'i but especially the pilgrims to whom she  used to be such a source of inspiration and joy. All those who met her  left her presence with a new spirit and a firm determination to serve the  Cause for which she suffered so much and whose progress was so near to her  heart.    What the Guardian is glad about is that her passing is creating a new  spirit among the friends and arousing them to greater effort. May her  death do for the progress of the Faith as much as her life did.          Publication of Baha'u'llah & the New Era      [From the Guardian:]    I wish to emphasize afresh the vital necessity of speeding up the work of  the translation and publication of the Gujrati, the Urdu and the Hindi  versions of the 'New Era', a book that has already been published into 14  different languages and is being translated into sixteen additional  tongues. I am deeply appreciative of what you have already achieved, and  wish to assure you of my continued prayers for the success of your  painstaking efforts and the realization of your dearest wish in the  service of our beloved Faith.    October 19, 1932    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to communicate with you to inquire regarding the  Hindi and Urdu translations of Dr. Esslemont's book. It is sometime that  he has had no definite word as to the progress of that work which you have  so kindly undertaken to supervise. He sincerely hopes that gradually that  task will be successfully achieved and that they will be ready to be  submitted to the printers and then to the readers who may be anxiously  awaiting to study them and benefit from their contents.    This work once completed will become a great stimulus to the teaching  activities of the friends, for books can do infinitely more work than  teachers. Sitting in a chair in a solitary corner one is infinitely more  receptive to truth than in a lecture hall or in a discussion group. The  public has learned the habit of reading. It is through that channel  therefore that we have to approach them.    November 19, 1932    He was very glad to obtain some news regarding the translation of Dr.  Esslemont's book into Urdu and Hindi, for he feels deeply interested in  the work. He feels that it is only when such books are accessible to the  public that the Cause will begin to spread and its followers increase in  number.    He, therefore, wishes you to exert your effort along that line so that the  task may be achieved properly and without any needless delay. Also please  keep him informed regarding any new development or any progress made.    We do not now have any pilgrims, but the news we receive from different  parts of the world show great progress achieved by the friends. Even  though material conditions in some instances hamper their activities to an  appreciable extent, yet their devotion and self-sacrifice are daily  winning for them the admiration and sympathy of the world around them.  Every day a new group is formed and new souls attracted to the faith.    [From the Guardian:]    I grieve to learn of the delay in the translation and publication of the  various translations of Dr. Esslemont's valuable book, and I urge you to  do all you possibly can to hasten the realization of our cherished  hopes--hopes which when fulfilled will no doubt lend a great and fresh  impetus to the advancement of the Faith in that land. I am enclosing a  copy of my recent letter concerning the Greatest Holy Leaf and the  measures which, I feel, must be taken by the friends in Persia preliminary  to the formation of the House of Justice.    January 10, 1933          Baha'i Center in Calcutta      He sincerely hopes that through God's infinite blessings the necessary sum  will be forthcoming and that in time a Center worthy of the prestige and  name of the Cause will be purchased or built.    Such institutions greatly help the spread of the Faith, for there will be  a permanent place where the interested souls can go for information. It  also operates as the center of the different activities of the Spiritual  Assembly of that locality.    In his moments of prayer at the Blessed Shrines, the Guardian will think  of you as well as of the other friends in that locality and ask for you  all divine guidance and help.    He was also delighted to hear that three new souls have accepted the Faith  in Calcutta. He hopes that before long we will have large groups,  comprising hundreds of earnest and seeking souls, enter the Cause and take  part in spreading the Message. Please assure the three of them of Shoghi  Effendi's loving greetings.    February 8, 1933"]]]
