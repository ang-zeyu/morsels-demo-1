In a world  where everything is from necessity, a God who remedies nothing, and  allows things to follow their own course, is He anything else but  destiny or necessity personified? It is a deaf God who can effect no  change on the general laws to which He is subjected Himself. What do I  care for the infinite power of a being who can do but a very few things  to please me? Where is the infinite kindness of a being who is  indifferent to my happiness? What good to me is the favor of a being  who, able to bestow upon me infinite good, does not even give me a  finite one?          LVII.--THE VANITY OF THEOLOGICAL CONSOLATIONS  IN THE TROUBLES OF THIS LIFE. THE HOPE OF A HEAVEN, OF A FUTURE LIFE,  IS BUT IMAGINARY.    When we ask why, under a good God, so many are wretched, we are reminded  that the present world is but a pass-way, designed to conduct man to a  happier sphere; we are assured that our sojourn on the earth, where we  live, is for trial; they silence us by saying that God would not impart  to His creatures either the indifference to the sufferings of others, or  the infinite happiness which He reserved for Himself alone. How can we  be satisfied with these answers?    1. The existence of another life has no other guaranty than the  imagination of men, who, in supposing it, have but manifested their  desire to live again, in order to enter upon a purer and more durable  state of happiness than that which they enjoy at present.    2. How can we conceive of a God who, knowing all things, must know to  their depths the nature of His creatures, and yet must have so many  proofs in order to assure Himself of their proclivities?    3. According to the calculations of our chronologists, the earth which  we inhabit has existed for six or seven thousand years; during this time  the nations have, under different forms, experienced many vicissitudes  and calamities; history shows us that the human race in all ages has  been tormented and devastated by tyrants, conquerors, heroes; by wars,  inundations, famines, epidemics, etc. Is this long catalogue of proofs  of such a nature as to inspire us with great confidence in the hidden  views of the Divinity? Do such constant evils give us an exalted idea of  the future fate which His kindness is preparing for us?    4. If God is as well-disposed as they assure us He is, could He not at  least, without bestowing an infinite happiness upon men, communicate to  them that degree of happiness of which finite beings are susceptible? In  order to be happy, do we need an Infinite or Divine happiness?    5. If God has not been able to render men happier than they are here  below, what will become of the hope of a Paradise, where it is pretended  that the elect or chosen few will rejoice forever in ineffable  happiness? If God could not or would not remove evil from the earth (the  only sojourning place we know of), what reason could we have to presume  that He can or will remove it from another world, of which we know  nothing? More than two thousand years ago, according to Lactance, the  wise epicure said: \"Either God wants to prevent evil, and can not, or He  can and will not; or He neither can nor will, or He will and can. If He  wants to, without the power, He is impotent; if He can, and will not, He  is guilty of malice which we can not attribute to Him; if He neither can  nor will, He is both impotent and wicked, and consequently can not be  God; if He wishes to and can, whence then comes evil, or why does He not  prevent it?\" For more than two thousand years honest minds have waited  for a rational solution of these difficulties; and our theologians teach  us that they will not be revealed to us until the future life.          LVIII.--ANOTHER IDLE FANCY.    We are told of a pretended scale for human beings; it is supposed that  God has divided His creatures into different classes, each one enjoying  the degree of happiness of which he is susceptible. According to this  romantic arrangement, all beings, from the oyster to the angel, enjoy  the happiness which belongs to them. Experience contradicts this sublime  revery. In the world where we are, we see all sentient beings living and  suffering in the midst of dangers. Man can not step without wounding,  tormenting, crushing a multitude of sentient beings which he finds in  his path, while he himself, at every step, is exposed to a throng of  evils seen or unseen, which may lead to his destruction. Is not the very  thought of death sufficient to mar his greatest enjoyment? During the  whole course of his life he is subject to sufferings; there is not a  moment when he feels sure of preserving his existence, to which he is so  strongly attached, and which he regards as the greatest gift of  Divinity.          LIX.--IN VAIN DOES THEOLOGY EXERT ITSELF TO ACQUIT GOD OF MAN'S DEFECTS.  EITHER THIS GOD IS NOT FREE, OR HE IS MORE WICKED THAN GOOD.    The world, it will be said, has all the perfection of which it was  susceptible; by the very reason that the world was not the God who made  it, it was necessary that it should have great qualities and great  defects. But we will answer, that the world necessarily having great  defects, it would have been better suited to the nature of a good God  not to create a world which He could not render completely happy. If  God, who was, according to you, supremely happy before the world was  created, had continued to be supremely happy in the created world, why  did He not remain in peace? Why must man suffer? Why must man exist What  is his existence to God? Nothing or something. If his existence is not  useful or necessary to God, why did He not leave him in nothingness? If  man's existence is necessary to His glory, He then needed man, He lacked  something before this man existed!    We can forgive an unskillful workman for doing imperfect work, because  he must work, well or ill, or starve; this workman is excusable; but  your God is not. According to you, He is self-sufficient; in this case,  why does He create men? He has, according to you, all that is necessary  to render man happy; why, then, does He not do it? You must conclude  that your God has more malice than goodness, or you must admit that God  was compelled to do what He has done, without being able to do  otherwise. However, you assure us that your God is free; you say also  that He is immutable, although beginning in time and ceasing in time to  exercise His power, like all the inconstant beings of this world. Oh,  theologians! you have made vain efforts to acquit your God of all the  defects of man; there is always visible in this God so perfect, \"a tip  of the [human] ear.\"          LX.--WE CAN NOT BELIEVE IN A DIVINE PROVIDENCE, IN AN INFINITELY GOOD AND  POWERFUL GOD.    Is not God the master of His favors? Has He not the right to dispense  His benefits? Can He not take them back again? His creature has no right  to ask the reason of His conduct; He can dispose at will of the works of  His hands. Absolute sovereign of mortals, He distributes happiness or  unhappiness, according to His pleasure. These are the solutions which  theologians give in order to console us for the evils which God inflicts  upon us. We would tell them that a God who was infinitely good, would  not be the master of His favors, but would be by His own nature obliged  to distribute them among His creatures; we would tell them that a truly  benevolent being would not believe he had the right to abstain from  doing good; we would tell them that a truly generous being does not take  back what he has given, and any man who does it, forfeits gratitude, and  has no right to complain of ingratitude. How can the arbitrary and  whimsical conduct which theologians ascribe to God, be reconciled with  the religion which supposes a compact or mutual agreement between this  God and men? If God owes nothing to His creatures, they, on their part,  can not owe anything to their God. All religion is founded upon the  happiness which men believe they have a right to expect from the  Divinity, who is supposed to tell them: \"Love, adore, obey me, and I  will render you happy!\" Men on their side say to Him: \"Make us happy, be  faithful to your promises, and we will love you, we will adore you, we  will obey your laws!\" In neglecting the happiness of His creatures, in  distributing His favors and His graces according to His caprice, and  taking back His gifts, does not God violate the contract which serves as  a base for all religion?    Cicero has said with reason that if God does not make Himself agreeable  to man, He can not be his God. [Nisi Deus homini placuerit, Deus non  erit.] Goodness constitutes Divinity; this Goodness can manifest itself  to man only by the advantages he derives from it. As soon as he is  unfortunate, this Goodness disappears and ceases to be Divinity. An  infinite Goodness can be neither partial nor exclusive. If God is  infinitely good, He owes happiness to all His creatures; one unfortunate  being alone would be sufficient to annihilate an unlimited goodness.  Under an infinitely good and powerful God, is it possible to conceive  that a single man could suffer? An animal, a mite, which suffers,  furnishes invincible arguments against Divine Providence and its  infinite benefactions.          LXI.--CONTINUATION.    According to theologians, the afflictions and evils of this life are  chastisements which culpable men receive from Divinity. But why are men  culpable? If God is Almighty, does it cost Him any more to say, \"Let  everything remain in order!\"--\"let all my subjects be good, innocent,  fortunate!\"--than to say, \"Let everything exist?\" Was it more difficult  for this God to do His work well than to do it so badly? Was it any  farther from the nonexistence of beings to their wise and happy  existence, than from their non-existence to their insensate and  miserable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#9)"],[1," even pleased to crack a few jokes over the novel machinery for  working the screw of the Okapi by levers, and in the  evening he  invited Mr. Hume to a friendly game of cards, thoughtfully including  in his invitation a bottle of brandy and a box of cigars, for, said  he, he wished to wash out the execrable taste of the everlasting  manioc.    All the day Muata stood bound to a post in the square, the central  figure of a ring of squatting natives, who chewed manioc and  discussed his approaching fate with much satisfaction.    He was there, an erect, stoical figure, when the boys sought their  room in the little thatched house--a room bare of furniture, divided  from the next compartment by hanging mats of native make.    \"It's a beastly shame,\" said Venning, for about the fourth time, as  he stared out at the black faces reflected in the blazing log-fires.    \"What is a shame?\" asked Compton, who was inspecting the  partition  before seeking his hammock.    \"You know well enough. Not a soul stands by the chief; even his  jackal bolted as soon as he jumped ashore.\"    \"Because Muata ordered him. He is probably watching from  the dark.\"    \"All the worse for us, then. I never thought Mr. Hume would have  knuckled down so easily. Hark at him shouting over the game.\"    \"What is the game, do you think?\"    \"Cards,\" snorted Venning, in disgust.    \"So! Queer sort of partition this;\" and Compton moved the mat aside.  \"No need for doors, you see. Hulloa! Who are you?\"    \"Me Zanzibar boy, master,\" exclaimed a soft, oily voice.    \"Then clear out.\"    \"Me put here watch my master--see black fellows no steal.\"    \"Oh, I see.  Chuck a cake of tobacco, Venning. Here! You like that?\"    \"Ver good,\" said the boy, reaching out a yellow hand for the  tobacco.    Venning crossed over and peered into the other room. \"You boy,\" he  said, \"tell me, what will they do to Muata?\"    The Zanzibari chuckled. \"You want know, eh?\"    \"We don't care. One black fellow does not matter,\" said Compton,  coolly.    \"You brute!\" muttered Venning, but stopped as Compton's hand gripped  him.    The Zanzibari chuckled again. \"What you give, eh, if cut loose that  Muata?\"    \"What do you say?\"    \"You pay me? Good. In night Muata is loose. He run up river. Bymby  master go along in little boat, pick Muata up, eh? What you pay?\"  and the boy chuckled softly.    \"Suppose I tell your white master, you rascal?\"    \"Wow! You tell, they kill poor Zanzibar boy.\"    \"Then clear out,\" said Compton, launching a kick; \"and if I see any  more of you I will tell.\"    The boy turned sulky. \"Me guard--me stay.\"    \"You go,\" said Compton, \"or I will call your masters, and let them  deal with you.\"    Growling under his breath, the self-styled \"guard\" slunk soft-footed  out of the room.  Compton struck a match and looked around the  apartment, then turned to Venning with a grin.    \"That is the game,\" he whispered.    \"I think I understand,\" Venning replied softly. \"That fellow was  testing you?\"    Compton nodded.    \"And you think Mr. Hume has not forgotten Muata?\"    \"I am sure he has not.\"    They crept into their hammocks, but not to sleep, and they were wide  awake when Mr. Hume entered noisily some two hours later.    \"To-morrow night,\" he shouted boisterously.    \"With pleasure, and the night after, for good visitors are rare,\"  called the Belgian.    \"And good hosts also. Touching those two men you promised as the  crew for my boat?\"    \"They will be here to-morrow evening,\" said the senior officer,  thrusting a head round the mat. \"Ah, you are comfortable, eh? Yes, I  sent a messenger to Hassan's camp by the vessel which brought you.  Rest well.\"    \"They are good fellows, these Arabs,\" said Mr. Hume, with  enthusiasm--\"good fellows. I remember once----\"    \"To-morrow night,\" said the officer, as he withdrew, laughing.    Mr. Hume hummed cheerfully as he prepared for bed, taking no notice  of his young comrades, who were regarding  him with silent  disfavour.  With one yawn after another he blew out the light, and  struggled into his hammock, to fall asleep almost at once.    Venning's uneasiness returned. He tossed restlessly, listening to  the unaccustomed noises from without, and as the hours went by, and  at last the sound of talking about the fires died off in a lazy  drone, the desire to see what had become of Muata was too strong to  resist. Softly he lowered himself to the earth-floor, but, soft as  he moved, others had heard.    \"Are the mosquitoes troublesome?\"    Venning started at the deep voice so unexpected. \"I did not know you  were awake, sir.\"    \"I sleep very lightly my boy.\"    \"As you are awake, sir, I would like to say----\"    But he stopped as the mat rustled.    \"Come in,\" said Mr. Hume.    \"Me guard, great master\"--in the same soft, oily tones Venning had  heard before. \"Hear noise. Think may be thieves.\"    \"Mosquitoes, not thieves,\" said Mr. Hume, quietly. \"Bring a light.\"    The Zanzibar boy complied, and, holding a taper above his head,  looked not for mosquitoes, but at the rifles in the corner.    \"The skeeters, master,\" he muttered, with an evil squint at Compton,  who was blinking at the light.    \"Better get back into your hammock, Venning. You can go, boy; and  keep a good watch, for we are coming to the thieves' hour.\"    The man showed his white teeth in a grin as he withdrew.    \"Don't stir from your hammocks until I do,\" said Mr. Hume, very  sternly, in a whisper; then louder, \"Good night, Venning.\"    \"Good night, sir,\" said Venning, convinced that the master was alive  to the game, and more easy in his mind.    As he dropped off to sleep he heard the wail of a jackal, and next  he was awakened by the sound of a native chanting. It was already  daybreak, and Mr. Hume stood on the verandah, having drawn the mats  aside.    The sun, striking under the thatch, shone on the hunter's tawny hair  and beard, and Venning wondered how for a moment he could have  doubted the courage of a man with such a lion-like head. But he was  to receive another shock.    \"Silence, dog!\" roared the hunter, addressing the singer, evidently.    Compton, who was sitting on his hammock dressing, looked out.    \"By Jove,\" he muttered, \"he's shouting at Muata!\"    Venning jumped down to the floor and looked out. Muata was still  bound to the post, and, with his face to the sun, was chanting his  words of greeting or of farewell in tones that lacked the deep  chest-notes of his war-cry.    One of the natives, hearing the order of the white man, flung a  stick at the chief with an insult; but Muata, nothing heeding, sang  on his slow song in a voice that was almost like a woman's.    \"Must white men lose their sleep because a robber is to die?\" roared  the hunter again.    Venning snatched up a beaker of water and ran out barefooted. He  held the water to the chiefs mouth. Muata turned his smouldering  eyes on the boy, sucked in a mouthful of the water, and then shot it  out over Venning's outstretched arm.    Venning dropped the mug, and went back with a red face to see the  two officers regarding him with sour faces.    \"Serve you right,\" shouted Mr. Hume, in apparent fury. \"When will  you learn to treat a black like the brute he is?\"    \"Quite so,\" said the senior officer, showing himself. \"I am glad to  find you have no ridiculous sentiment.\"    \"Ah! good morning, my friend,\" said Mr. Hume, heartily. \"As for my  young comrade, you must pardon him.\"    \"He has his lesson,\" said the officer, dryly, as he pointed to the  soaked pyjama.    \"The man woke me with his singing. I have seen men shot for less  than that.\"    \"In good time,\" said the officer, with a sinister look, \"the  accusers will be here to-night, and to-morrow\"--he made a gesture--  \"to-morrow you can also choose the two men you need for your boat's  crew.\"    After breakfast, Mr. Hume had an opportunity of speaking without the  fear of being overheard, for they finished putting the Okapi  together, and worked her out by the levers into the river, where she  gleamed in the sun.    \"I dare say you think I am a brute,\" he said, \"and I don't blame  you; but if we mean to save Muata's life, we must appear to be  altogether indifferent to his fate. Those men are keeping a close  watch on us.\"    \"I know it,\" said Compton.    \"You do, eh?\"    \"That Zanzibar boy was spying on us last night before you came, and  he tried to get us to bribe him to free Muata.\"    \"I hope you were not so foolish as to fall into the trap?\" said the  hunter, sharply.    \"I kicked him out of the place,\" said Compton. \"I told Venning you  were playing a game for Muata's life.\"    \"You did me justice?\" said Mr. Hume, with his gaze on Venning.    \"It seemed to me terrible to leave him without a word of  encouragement,\" said the boy; \"but I am awfully sorry I doubted you,  sir.\"    \"You don't now, eh? Well, that's all right, and I think the chief  knows too. That is why he spouted the water over you.\"    \"A strange way of showing his gratitude,\" laughed the boy, with a  reddening face at the thought of the outrage.    \"Not so strange. He saw the Belgians, and did it to put them off  their guard.\"    \"That ought to help us in our plans for his escape.\"    \"We have plans, have we?\"    \"You have,\" said Compton, confidently; \"and your plan is our plan.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the hunter, quietly. \"If the plan is to succeed,  it must work to-night. I do not fear these people here, but I must  say I fear the Arabs who are expected this evening.\"    \"I understand that you will choose two of those Arabs as boatmen?\"    \"The Belgians have arranged that, Compton, not I. Have you any  suggestions to offer?\"    \"I think, sir, that we should get all our things stored in the boat  to-day,\" said Venning.    \"Eight; and then?\"    \"And then,\" said Venning, his face all alight with ardour--\"and  then--why, sir, then you shoot one of the hippos over there on that  little island. Shoot two; and while all the people in the village  "]]]
