It must be accompanied  by the sacrament of penance, which consists of contrition,  confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness.    Outside the gate of Purgatory justification cannot be complete.  The souls in the Ante-Purgatory typify those who have entered on  the way towards justification, but have not yet attained it. They  undergo a period of mortification to sin, of deliberation, as St.  Thomas Aquinas says: \"Contingit autem quandoque quod praecedit  aliqua deliberatio quae non est do substantia justificationis sed  via in justificationem.\" Summa Theol., l. c. art. 7.      We drew near to it, and reached such place that there, where at  first there seemed to me a rift, like a cleft which divides a  wall, I saw a gate, and three steps beneath for going to it of  divers colors, and a gatekeeper who as yet said not a word. And  as I opened my eye there more and more, I saw him sitting on the  upper step, such in his face that I endured it not.[1] And he had  in his hand a naked sword, which so reflected the rays toward us  that I often raised my sight in vain. \"Tell it from there, what  would ye?\" began he to say; \"where is the guide? Beware lest the  coming up be harmful to you.\" [2] \"A lady from Heaven with these  things acquainted,\" replied my Master to him, \"only just now said  to us, 'Go thither, here is the gate.'\" \"And may she speed your  progress in good,\" began again the courteous gatekeeper, \"come  forward then unto our steps.\"    [1] The angel at the gate appears to be the type of the priest  who administers absolution.    [2] Unless grace has been infused into the heart it is a sin to  present one's self as ready for the sacrament.      Thither we came to the first great stair; it was of white marble  so polished and smooth that I mirrored myself in it as I appear.  The second, of deeper hue than perse, was of a rough and scorched  stone, cracked lengthwise and athwart. The third, which above  lies massy, seemed to me of porphyry as flaming red as blood that  spirts forth from a vein. Upon this the Angel of God held both  his feet, seated upon the threshold that seemed to me stone of  adamant.[1] Up over the three steps my Leader drew me with good  will, saying, \"Beg humbly that he undo the lock.\" Devoutly I  threw myself at the holy feet; I besought for mercy's sake that  he would open for me; but first upon my breast I struck three  times.[2] Seven P's upon my forehead he inscribed with the point  of his sword,[3] and \"See that thou wash these wounds when thou  art within,\" he said.    [1] The first step is the symbol of confession, the second of  contrition, the third of satisfaction; the threshold of adamant  may perhaps signify the authority of the Church.    [2] Three times, in penitence for sins in thought, in word, and  in deed.    [3] The seven P's stand for the seven so-called mortal sins,--  Peccati, not specific acts, but the evil dispositions of the soul  from which all evil deeds spring,--pride, envy, anger, sloth  (accidia), avarice, gluttony, and lust. After justification these  dispositions which already have been overcome, must be utterly  removed from the soul.      Ashes or earth dug out dry would be of one color with his  vestment, and from beneath that he drew two keys. One was of gold  and the other was of silver; first with the white and then with  the yellow he so did to the door, that I was content.[1]  \"Whenever one of these keys fails, and turns not rightly in the  lock,\" said he to us, \"this passage doth not open. More precious  is one[2] but the other requires much art and wit before it  unlocks, because it is the one that disentangles the knot. From  Peter I hold them; and he told me to err rather in opening than  in keeping shut, if but the people prostrate themselves at my  feet.\" Then he pushed the valve of the sacred gate, saying,  \"Enter, but I give you warning that whoso looks behind returns  outside.\"[3] And when the pivots of that sacred portal, which are  of metal, sonorous and strong, were turned within their hinges,  Tarpeia roared not so loud nor showed herself so harsh, when the  good Metellus was taken from her, whereby she afterwards remained  lean.[4]    [1] The golden key is typical of the power to open, and the  silver of the knowledge to whom to open.    [2] The gold, more precious because the power of absolution was  purchased by the death of the Saviour.    [3] For he who returns to his sins loses the Divine Grace.    [4] This roaring of the gate may, perhaps, be intended to enforce  the last words of the angel, and may symbolize the voices of his  own sins as the sinner turns his back on them. When Caesar forced  the doors of the temple of Saturn on the Tarpeian rock, in order  to lay hands on the sacred treasure of Rome, he was resisted by  the tribune Metellus.      I turned away attentive to the first tone,[1] and it seemed to me  I heard \"Te Deum laudamus\"[2] in voices mingled with sweet sound.  That which I heard gave me just such an impression as we are wont  to receive when people stand singing with an organ, and the words  now are, now are not caught.    [1] The first sound within Purgatory.    [2] Words appropriate to the entrance of a sinner that repenteth.        CANTO X. First Ledge: the Proud.--Examples of Humility sculptured  on the Rock.    When we were within the threshold of the gate, which the souls'  wrong love[1] disuses, because it makes the crooked way seem  straight, I heard by its resounding that it was closed again.  And, if I had turned my eyes to it, what excuse would have been  befitting for the fault?    [1] It is Dante's doctrine that love is the motive of every act;  rightly directed, of good deeds; perverted, of evil. See Canto  XVII.      We were ascending through a cloven rock, which moved on one side  and on the other, even as the wave retreats and approaches. \"Here  must be used a little art,\" began my Leader, \"in keeping close,  now here, now there to the side which recedes.\"[1] And this made  our progress so slow that the waning disk of the moon regained  its bed to go to rest, before we had come forth from that  needle's eye. But when we were free and open above, where the  mountain backward withdraws,[2] I weary, and both uncertain of  our way, we stopped upon a level more solitary than roads through  deserts. The space from its edge, where it borders the void, to  the foot of the high bank which rises only, a human body would  measure in three lengths; and as far as my eye could stretch its  wings, now on the left and now on the right side, such did this  cornice seem to me. Thereon our feet had not yet moved when I  perceived that bank round about, which, being perpendicular,  allowed no ascent, to be of white marble and adorned with such  carvings, that not Polycletus merely but Nature would be put to  shame there.    [1] The path was a narrow, steep zigzag, which, as it receded on  one side and the other, afforded the better foothold.    [2] Leaving an open space, the first ledge of Purgatory.      The Angel who came to earth with the announcement of the peace,  wept for for many years, which opened Heaven from its long  interdict, appeared before us here carved in a sweet attitude so  truly that he did not seem an image that is silent. One would  have sworn that he was saying \"Ave;\" for there was she imaged who  turned the key to open the exalted love. And in her action she  had these words impressed, \"Ecce ancilla Dei!\"[1] as exactly as a  shape is sealed in wax.    [1] \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord!\"      \"Keep not thy mind only on one place,\" said the sweet Master, who  had me on that side where people have their heart. Wherefore I  moved my eyes and saw behind Mary, upon that side where he was  who was moving me, another story displayed upon the rock;  whereupon I passed Virgil and drew near so that it might be set  before my eyes. There in the very marble was carved the cart and  the oxen drawing the holy ark, because of which men fear an  office not given in charge.[1] In front appeared people; and all  of them, divided in seven choirs, of two of my senses made the  one say \"NO,\" the other \"YES, THEY ARE SINGING.\"[2]  In like  manner, by the smoke of the incense that was imaged there, mine  eyes and nose were made in YES and NO discordant. There,  preceding the blessed vessel, dancing, girt up, was the humble  Psalmist, and more and less than king was he in that proceeding.  Opposite, figured at a window of a great palace, Michal was  looking on even as a lady scornful and troubled.[3]    [1] \"And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it  out of the house.. . and Uzzah and Ahio drave the new cart....and  when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah put forth his  hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook  it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God  smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of  God.\" 2 Samuel, vi. 4-7.    [2] The hearing said \"No,\" the sight said \"Yes.\"    [3] \"So David went and brought up the ark of God... into the city  of David with gladness. And when they that bare the ark of the  Lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. And  David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David was  girded with a linen ephod. So David and all the house of Israel  brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound  of the trumpet. And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of  David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window, and saw  King David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised  him in her heart.\" 2 Samuel, vi. 12-16.      I moved my feet from the place where I was standing to look from  near at another story which behind Michal was shining white on  me.

By this heaven  in which the shadow that your world makes comes to a point[2] she  was taken up before any other soul at the triumph of Christ. It  was well befitting to leave her in some heaven, as a palm of the  high victory which was won with the two hands,[3] because she  aided the first glory of Joshua within the Holy Land, which  little touches the memory of the Pope.    [1] \"By faith the harlot Rabab perished not with them that  believed not.\"--Hebrews, xi. 31. See Joshua, ii. 1-21; vi. 17;  James, ii. 25.    [2] The conical shadow of the earth ended, according to Ptolemy,  at the heaven of Venus. Philalethes suggests that there may be  here an allegorical meaning, the shadow of the earth being shown  in feebleness of will, worldly ambition, and inordinate love,  which have allotted the souls who appear in these first heavens  to the lowest grades in Paradise.    [3] Nailed to the cross. The glory of Joshua was the winning of  the Holy Land for the inheritance of the children of Israel.      \"Thy city, which is plant of him who first turned his back on his  Maker, and whose envy[1] has been so bewept, produces and  scatters the accursed flower[2] which has led astray the sheep  and the lambs, because it has made a wolf of the shepherd. For  this the Gospel and the great Doctors are deserted, and there is  study only of the Decretals,[3] as is apparent by their margins.  On this the Pope and the Cardinals are intent; their thoughts go  not to Nazareth, there where Gabriel spread his wings. But the  Vatican, and the other elect parts of Rome, which have been the  burial place for the soldiery that followed Peter, shall soon be  free from this adultery.\"[4]    [1] \"Through envy of the devil came death into the world.\"--  Wisdom of Solomon, ii. 24.

Ascent to the Sun.--Spirits of the wise, and the learned  in theology.--St. Thomas Aquinas.--He names to Dante those who  surround him.    Looking upon His Son with the Love which the one and the other  eternally breathe forth, the Primal and Ineffable Power made  everything which revolves through the mind or through space with  such order that he who contemplates it cannot be without taste of  Him.[1] Lift then thy sight, Reader, with me to the lofty wheels,  straight to that region where the one motion strikes on the  other;[2] and there begin to gaze with delight on the art of that  Master who within Himself so loves it that His eye never departs  from it. See how from that point the oblique circle which bears  the planets[3] branches off, to satisfy the world which calls on  them;[4] and if their road had not been bent, much virtue in the  heavens would be in vain, and well-nigh every potency dead here  below.[5] And if from the straight line its departure had been  more or less distant, much of the order of the world, both below  and above, would be defective. Now do thou remain, Reader, upon  thy bench,[6] following in thought that which is fore. tasted, if  thou wouldst be glad far sooner than weary. I have set before  thee; henceforth feed thee by thyself, for that theme whereof I  have been made scribe wrests all my care unto itself.    [1] All things, as well the spiritual and invisible objects of  the intelligence as the corporal and visible objects of sense,  were made by God the Father, operating through the Son, with the  love of the Holy Spirit, and made in such order that he who  contemplates the creation beholds the partial image of the  Creator.    [2] At the equinox, the season of Dante's journey, the sun in  Aries is at the intersection of the ecliptic and the equator of  the celestial sphere, and his apparent motion in his annual  revolution cuts the apparent diurnal motion of the fixed stars,  which is performed in circles parallel to the equator.    [3] The ecliptic.    [4] Which invokes their influence.    [5] Because on the obliquity of their path depends the variety of  their influence.    [6] As a scholar.      The greatest minister of nature, which imprints the world with  the power of the heavens, and with its light measures the time  for us, in conjunction with that region called to mind above, was  circling through the spirals in which from day to day he earlier  presents himself.[1] And I was with him; but of the ascent I was  not aware, otherwise than as a man is aware, before his first  thought, of its coming. Beatrice is she who thus conducts from  good to better so swiftly that her act extends not through time.    [1] In that spiral course in which, according to the Ptolemaic  system, the sun passes from the equator to the tropic of Cancer,  rising earlier every day.      How lucent of itself must that have been which, within the sun  where I entered, was appareiit not by color but by light! Though  I should call on genius, art, and use, I could not tell it so  that it could ever be imagined; but it may be believed, and sight  of it longed for. And if our fancies are low for such loftiness,  it is no marvel, for beyond the sun was never eye could go.  Such[1] was here the fourth family of the High Father, who always  satisfies it, showing how He breathes forth, and how He  begets.[2] And Beatrice began, \"Thank, thank thou the Sun of  the Angels, who to this visible one has raised thee by His  grace.\" Heart of mortal was never so disposed to devotion, and so  ready, with its own entire pleasure, to give itself to God, as I  became at those words; and all my love was so set on Him that  Beatrice was eclipsed in oblivion. It displeased her not; but she  so smiled thereat that the splendor of her smiling eyes divided  upon many things my singly intent mind.    [1] So lucent, brighter than the sun.    [2] Showing himself in the Holy Spirit and in the Son.      I saw many living and surpassing effulgences make a centre of  us, and make a crown of themselves, more sweet in voice than  shining in aspect. Thus girt we sometimes see the daughter of  Latona, when the air is pregnant so that it holds the thread  which makes the girdle.[1] In the court of Heaven, wherefrom I  return, are found many jewels so precious and beautiful that they  cannot be brought from the kingdom, and of these was the song of  those lights. Who wings not himself so that he may fly up  thither, let him await the tidings thence from the dumb.    [1] When the air is so full of vapor that it forms a halo.      After those burning suns, thus singing, had circled three times  round about us, like stars near fixed poles, they seemed to me as  ladies not loosed from a dance, but who stop silent, listening  till they have caught the new notes. And within one I heard  begin, \"Since the ray of grace, whereby true love is kindled, and  which thereafter grows multiplied in loving, so shines on thee  that it conducts thee upward by that stair upon which, without  reascending, no one descends, he who should deny to thee the wine  of his flask for thy thirst, would not be more at liberty than  water which descends not to the sea.[1] Thou wishest to know with  what plants this garland is enflowered, which, round about her,  gazes with delight upon the, beautiful Lady who strengthens thee  for heaven. I was of the lambs of the holy flock[2] which Dominic  leads along the way where one fattens well if he stray not.[3]  This one who is nearest to me on the right was my brother and  master; and he was Albert of Cologne,[4] and I Thomas of Aquino.  If thus of all the rest thou wishest to be informed, come,  following my speech, with thy sight circling around upon the  blessed chaplet. That next flaming issues from the smile of  Gratian, who so assisted one court and the other that it pleases  in Paradise.[5] The next, who at his side adorns our choir, was  that Peter who, like the poor woman, offered his treasure to Holy  Church.[6] The fifth light, which is most beautiful among us,[7]  breathes from such love, that all the world there below is greedy  to know tidings of it.[8] Within it is the lofty mind, wherein  wisdom so profound was put, that, if the truth is true, to see so  much no second has arisen.[9] At his side thou seest the light of  that candle, which, below in the flesh, saw most inwardly the  angelic nature, and its ministry.[10] In the next little light  smiles that advocate of the Christian times, with whose discourse  Augustine provided himself.[11] Now if thou leadest the eye of  the mind, following my praises, from light to light, thou  remainest already thirsting for the eighth. Therewithin, through  seeing every good, the holy soul rejoices which makes the deceit  of the world manifest to whoso hears him well.[12] The body  whence it was hunted out lies below in Cieldauro,[13] and from  martyrdom and from exile it came unto this peace. Beyond thou  seest flaming the burning breath of Isidore, of Bede, and of  Richard who in contemplation was more than man.[14] The one from  whom thy look returns to me is the light of a spirit to whom in  grave thoughts death seemed to come slow. It is the eternal light  of Sigier,[15] who reading in the Street of Straw syllogized  truths which were hated.\"    [1] He would be restrained against his nature, as water prevented  from flowing down to the sea.
