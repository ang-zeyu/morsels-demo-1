While thus pursuing its way, lo and behold! it  found a little purse with two half-pennies. Taking it in its beak, the  bird turned and went back toward the old man's house. On the road it  met a carriage containing a gentleman and several ladies. The  gentleman looked at the rooster, saw a purse in its bill, and said to  the driver:    \"Get down and see what this rooster has in its beak.\"    The driver hastily jumped from his box, took the little purse from the  rooster's bill, and gave it to his master. The gentleman put it in his  pocket and drove on. The rooster was very angry and ran after the  carriage, repeating continually:        \"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,      To me the little purse give back.\"    The enraged gentleman said to the coachman as they passed a well:    \"Take that impudent rooster and throw it into the well.\"    The driver got down from his box again, seized the rooster, and flung  it down the well. When the rooster saw that its life was in such great  danger, what was it to do?    It began to swallow the water, and drank and drank till it had  swallowed all the water in the well. Then it flew out and again ran  after the carriage, calling:        \"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,      To me the little purse give back.\"    When the gentleman saw this, he was perfectly amazed and said:    \"Hoho! This rooster is a perfect imp of Satan! Never mind! I'll wring  your neck, you saucy cockerel!\" When he reached home he told the cook  to take the rooster, throw it on the coals burning upon the hearth,  and push a big stone in front of the opening in the chimney. The old  woman did what her master bade her.    When the rooster saw this new injustice, it began to spit out the  water it had swallowed till it had poured all the water from the well  upon the burning coals. This put out the fire, cooled the hearth, and  made such a flood on the kitchen floor that the cook fainted away from  pure rage. Then the rooster gave the stone a push, came out safe and  sound, ran to the gentleman's window, and began to knock on the panes  with its bill, screaming:        \"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,      To me the little purse give back.\"    \"Heaven knows that I've got a torment in this monster of a rooster,\"  said the gentleman. \"Driver, rid me of it, toss it into the middle of  the herds of cows and oxen; perhaps some bull will stick its horns  through it and relieve us.\" The coachman seized the rooster and flung  it among the herds. You ought to have seen the rooster's delight. It  swallowed bulls, oxen, cows, and calves, till it had devoured the  whole herd and its stomach had grown as big as a mountain. Then it  went to the window again, spread out its wings before the sun so that  it darkened the gentleman's room, and once more began:        \"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,      To me the little purse give back.\"    When the gentleman saw this he was ready to burst with rage and did  not know what to do to get rid of the rooster. He stood thinking till  at last an idea entered his head:    \"I'll lock it up in the treasure-chamber. Perhaps if it tries to  swallow the ducats one will stick in its throat, and I shall get rid  of the bird.\" No sooner said than done. He grasped the rooster and  flung it into the treasure-chamber. The rooster swallowed all the  money and left the chests empty. Then it escaped from the room, went  to the gentleman's window, and again began:        \"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,      To me the little purse give back.\"    As the gentleman saw that there was nothing else to be done he tossed  the purse out. The rooster picked it up, went about its own business,  and left the gentleman in peace. All the poultry ran after the rooster  so that it really looked like a wedding; but the gentleman turned  green with rage as he watched, and said sighing:    \"Let them all run off to the last chick, I'm glad to be rid of the  torment; there was witchcraft in that rooster!\"    But the puffed-up rooster stalked proudly along, followed by all the  fowls, and went merrily on and on till he reached the old man's house  and began to crow: \"Kikeriki!\"    When the old man heard the rooster's voice he ran out joyfully to meet  the bird, but looking through the door what did he see? His rooster  had become a terrible object. An elephant beside it would have seemed  like a flea; and following behind came countless flocks of birds, each  one more beautiful and brilliant than the other. When the old man saw  the rooster so huge and fat, he opened the gate for it. \"Master,\" said  the bird, \"spread a sheet here in the middle of the yard.\"    The old man, as nimble as a top, laid down the sheet. The rooster took  its stand upon it, spread its wings, and instantly the whole yard was  filled with birds and herds of cattle, but it shook out on the sheet a  pile of ducats that flashed in the sun till they dazzled the eyes.  When the old man beheld this vast treasure he did not know what to do  in his delight, and hugged and kissed the rooster.    But all at once the old woman appeared from somewhere, and when she  saw this marvelous spectacle her eyes glittered in her head, and she  was ready to burst with wrath.    \"Dear old friend,\" she said, \"give me a few ducats.\"    \"Pine away with longing for them, old woman; when I begged you for  some eggs, you know what you answered. Now flog your hen, that it may  bring you ducats. I beat my rooster, and you see what it has fetched  me.\"    The old woman went to the hen-coop, shook the hen, took it by the  tail, and gave it such a drubbing that it was enough to make one weep  for pity. When the poor hen escaped from the old woman's hands it fled  to the highway. While walking along it found a bead, swallowed it,  hurried back home as fast as possible, and began to cackle at the  gate. The old woman welcomed it joyfully. The hen ran quickly in at  the gate, passed its mistress, and went to its nest--at the end of an  hour it jumped off, cackling loudly. The old woman hastened to see  what the hen had laid. But when she glanced into the nest what did she  perceive? A little glass bead. The hen had laid a glass bead! When the  old woman saw that the hen had fooled her, she began to beat it, and  beat till she flogged it to death. So the stupid old soul remained as  poor as a church-mouse. From that time she might live on roast nothing  and golden wait a while, instead of eggs, for she had abused and  killed the poor hen, though it was not at all to blame.    But the old man was very rich; he built great houses, laid out  beautiful gardens, and lived luxuriously. He made the old woman his  poultry-maid, the rooster he took about with him everywhere, dressed  in a gold collar, yellow boots, and spurs on its heels, so that one  might have thought it was one of the Three Kings from the Christmas  play instead of a mere ordinary rooster.          Mogarzea and His Son.      There was once a young lad who had neither father nor mother. Every  thing his parents had left him was in the care of guardians, and at  last he could bear their unjust reproaches no longer, but went out  into the wide world, entered a path leading to a glade in the forest,  and followed it a long way.    When, in the evening, he grew tired and found no place to rest, he  climbed a hill and gazed around him in every direction to try to  discover a light; after a long search he saw the flicker of a tiny  spark and went toward it. He walked and walked half the night, then he  came to a huge fire, by which a man as big as a giant was sleeping.  What was the youth to do? After thinking a while, he crept into one  leg of the man's trowsers and spent the rest of the night there.    When the man rose the next morning, to his great astonishment, he saw  the youngster drop out of his breeches.    \"Where did you come from?\" he asked.    \"I was sent to you for a son last night,\" replied the lad.    \"If that is true,\" said the big man, \"you may tend my sheep, and I'll  give you something to eat, but beware that you don't cross the  boundaries, or woe betide you!\"    He pointed out to the boy the end of his land, and then added:    \"God be with you!\"    The lad tended the flock all day, and when he returned in the evening  found the fire lighted, and helped the giant milk the sheep.    After their work was done, they sat down to supper, and while they  were eating the boy asked:    \"What is your name, father?\"    \"Mogarzea,\" replied the big fellow.    \"I wonder you don't get tired of staying here alone in this  wilderness.\"    \"Then you wonder without cause. Don't you know that the bear never  dances willingly?\"    \"Yes, you're right there,\" replied the boy. \"But I see that you are  always dull and sad. Tell me your story, father.\"    \"What can be the use of telling you things that would make you  sorrowful too?\"    \"Never mind, I should like to know them. Are you not my father? Do you  suppose you have me as a son for nothing?\"    \"Well then, if that's true and you wish it, listen to my story.    \"My name, as I have already told you, is Mogarzea; I am a prince, and  set out to go to the Sweet-milk Lake, which is not far from here, to  marry a fairy. I had heard that three fairies lived there. But Fortune  did not smile upon me; wicked elves attacked me and took away my soul.  Since that time I have settled here to dwell with my sheep on this  little patch of land, without being able to take pleasure in any  thing, without having a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#9)"],[1,", so  unrequited in material things, felt a new stimulus as he began to  investigate the lower animals, so promising a field for discovery.    He said himself:      \"That which is the more singular is that the most important    phenomena to be considered have been offered to our meditations only    since the time when attention has been paid to the animals least    perfect, and when researches on the different complications of the    organization of these animals have become the principal foundation    of their study. It is not less singular to realize that it was    almost always from the examination of the smallest objects which    nature presents to us, and that of considerations which seem to us    the most minute, that we have obtained the most important knowledge    to enable us to arrive at the discovery of her laws, and to    determine her course.\"    After a year of preparation he opened his course at the Museum in the  spring of 1794. In his introductory lecture, given in 1803, after ten  years of work on the lower animals, he addressed his class in these  words:      \"Indeed it is among those animals which are the most multiplied and    numerous in nature, and the most ready to regenerate themselves,    that we should seek the most instructive facts bearing on the course    of nature, and on the means she has employed in the creation of her    innumerable productions. In this case we perceive that, relatively    to the animal kingdom, we should chiefly devote our attention to the    invertebrate animals, because their enormous multiplicity in nature,    the singular diversity of their systems of organization and of their    means of multiplication, their increasing simplification, and the    extreme fugacity of those which compose the lowest orders of these    animals, show us, much better than the higher animals, the true    course of nature, and the means which she has used and which she    still unceasingly employs to give existence to all the living bodies    of which we have knowledge.\"    During this decade (1793-1803) and the one succeeding, Lamarck's mind  grew and expanded. Before 1801, however much he may have brooded over  the matter, we have no utterances in print on the transformation theory.  His studies on the lower animals, and his general knowledge of the  vertebrates derived from the work of his contemporaries and his  observations in the Museum and menagerie, gave him a broad grasp of the  entire animal kingdom, such as no one before him had. As the result, his  comprehensive mind, with its powers of rapid generalization, enabled him  to appreciate the series from monad (his _ebauche_) to man, the range of  forms from the simple to the complex. Even though not a comparative  anatomist like Cuvier, he made use of the latter's discoveries, and  could understand and appreciate the gradually increasing complexity of  forms; and, unlike Cuvier, realize that they were blood relations, and  not separate, piece-meal creations. Animal life, so immeasurably higher  than vegetable forms, with its highly complex physiological functions  and varied means of reproduction, and the relations of its forms to each  other and to the world around, affords facts for evolution which were  novel to Lamarck, the descriptive botanist.    [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK. REAR VIEW, FROM THE WEST]    [Illustration: MAISON DE BUFFON, IN WHICH LAMARCK LIVED IN PARIS.  1793-1829]    In accordance with the rules of the Museum, which required that all the  professors should be lodged within the limits of the Jardin, the choice  of lodgings being given to the oldest professors, Lamarck, at the time  of his appointment, took up his abode in the house now known as the  Maison de Buffon, situated on the opposite side of the Jardin des  Plantes from the house afterwards inhabited by Cuvier, and in the angle  between the Galerie de Zoologie and the Museum library.[37] With little  doubt the windows of his study, where his earlier addresses, the  _Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivans_, and the _Philosophie  Zoologique_, were probably written, looked out upon what is now the  court on the westerly side of the house, that facing the Rue Geoffroy  St. Hilaire.    At the time of his entering on his duties as professor of zooelogy,  Lamarck was in his fiftieth year. He had married twice and was the  father of six children, and without fortune. He married for a third, and  afterwards for a fourth time, and in all, seven children were born to  him, as in the year (1794) the minute referring to his request for an  indemnity states: \"Il est charge de sept enfans dont un est sur les  vaisseaux de la Republique.\" Another son was an artist, as shown by the  records of the Assembly of the Museum for September 23, 1814, when he  asked for a chamber in the lodgings of Thouin, for the use of his son,  \"_peintre_.\"    Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in 1829, spoke of one of his sons, M. Auguste de  Lamarck, as a skilful and highly esteemed engineer of Ponts-et-Chaussees,  then advantageously situated.    But man cannot live by scientific researches and philosophic meditations  alone. The history of Lamarck's life is painful from beginning to end.  With his large family and slender salary he was never free from carking  cares and want. On the 30 fructidor, an II. of the Republic, the  National Convention voted the sum of 300,000 livres, with which an  indemnity was to be paid to citizens eminent in literature and art.  Lamarck had sacrificed much time and doubtless some money in the  preparation and publication of his works, and he felt that he had a just  claim to be placed on the list of those who had been useful to the  Republic, and at the same time could give proof of their good  citizenship, and of their right to receive such indemnity or  appropriation.    Accordingly, in 1795 he sent in a letter, which possesses much  autobiographical interest, to the Committee of Public Instruction, in  which he says:      \"During the twenty-six years that he has lived in Paris the citizen    Lamarck has unceasingly devoted himself to the study of natural    history, and particularly botany. He has done it successfully, for    it is fifteen years since he published under the title of _Flore    Francaise_ the history and description of the plants of France, with    the mention of their properties and of their usefulness in the arts;    a work printed at the expense of the government, well received by    the public, and which now is much sought after and very rare.\" He    then describes his second great botanical undertaking, the    _Encyclopaedia and Illustration of Genera_, with nine hundred plates.    He states that for ten years past he has kept busy \"a great number    of Parisian artists, three printing presses for different works,    besides delivering a course of lectures.\"    The petition was granted. At about this period a pension of twelve  hundred francs from the Academy of Sciences, and which had increased to  three thousand francs, had ceased eighteen months previously to be paid  to him. But at the time (an II.) Lamarck was \"charge de sept enfans,\"  and this appropriation was a most welcome addition to his small salary.    The next year (an III.) he again applied for a similar allowance from  the funds providing an indemnity for men of letters and artists \"whose  talents are useful to the Republic.\" Again referring to the _Flore  Francaise_, and his desire to prepare a second edition of it, and his  other works and travels in the interest of botanical science, he says:      \"If I had been less overburdened by needs of all kinds for some    years, and especially since the suppression of my pension from the    aforesaid Academy of Sciences, I should prepare the second edition    of this useful work; and this would be, without doubt, indeed, the    opportunity of making a new present to my country.      \"Since my return to France I have worked on the completion of my    great botanical enterprises, and indeed for about ten years past my    works have obliged me to keep in constant activity a great number of    artists, such as draughtsmen, engravers, and printers. But these    important works that I have begun, and have in a well-advanced    state, have been in spite of all my efforts suspended and    practically abandoned for the last ten years. The loss of my pension    from the Academy of Sciences and the enormous increase in the price    of articles of subsistence have placed me, with my numerous family,    in a state of distress which leaves me neither the time nor the    freedom from care to cultivate science in a fruitful way.\"    Lamarck's collection of shells, the accumulation of nearly thirty  years,[38] was purchased by the government at the price of five thousand  livres. This sum was used by him to balance the price of a national  estate for which he had contracted by virtue of the law of 28 ventose de  l'an IV.[39] This little estate, which was the old domain of Beauregard,  was a modest farm-house or country-house at Hericourt-Saint-Samson, in  the Department of Seine-et-Oise, not far to the northward of Beauvais,  and about fifty miles from Paris. It is probable that as a proprietor of  a landed property he passed the summer season, or a part of it, on this  estate.    This request was, we may believe, made from no unworthy or mercenary  motive, but because he thought that such an indemnity was his due. Some  years after (in 1809) the chair of zooelogy, newly formed by the Faculte  des Sciences in Paris, was offered to him. Desirable as the salary would  have been in his straitened circumstances, he modestly refused the  offer, because he felt unable at that time of life (he was, however, but  sixty-five years of age) to make the studies required worthily to occupy  the position.    One of Lamarck's projects, which he was never able to carry out, for it  was even then quite beyond the powers of any man single-hand"]]]
