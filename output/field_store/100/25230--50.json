So often has that charge of untruthfulness been repeated, and so  generally is it now accepted, that it seems almost Quixotic to try to  fight against it.    Nor should I venture to fight this almost hopeless battle, if I were  not convinced that such a charge, like all charges brought against a  whole nation, rests on the most flimsy induction, and that it has  done, is doing, and will continue to do more mischief than anything  that even the bitterest enemy of English dominion in India could have  invented. If a young man who goes to India as a civil servant or as a  military officer, goes there fully convinced that the people whom he  is to meet with are all liars, liars by nature or by national  instinct, never restrained in their dealings by any regard for truth,  never to be trusted on their word, need we wonder at the feelings of  disgust with which he thinks of the Hindus, even before he has seen  them; the feelings of distrust with which he approaches them, and the  contemptuous way in which he treats them when brought into contact  with them for the transaction of public or private business? When such  tares have once been sown by the enemy, it will be difficult to gather  them up. It has become almost an article of faith with every Indian  civil servant that all Indians are liars; nay, I know I shall never be  forgiven for my heresy in venturing to doubt it.    Now, quite apart from India, I feel most strongly that every one of  these international condemnations is to be deprecated, not only for  the sake of the self-conceited and uncharitable state of mind from  which they spring, and which they serve to strengthen and confirm, but  for purely logical reasons also, namely for the reckless and slovenly  character of the induction on which such conclusions rest. Because a  man has travelled in Greece and has been cheated by his dragoman, or  been carried off by brigands, does it follow that all Greeks, ancient  as well as modern, are cheats and robbers, or that they approve of  cheating and robbery? And because in Calcutta, or Bombay, or Madras,  Indians who are brought before judges, or who hang about the  law-courts and the bazaars, are not distinguished by an unreasoning  and uncompromising love of truth, is it not a very vicious induction  to say, in these days of careful reasoning, that all Hindus are  liars--particularly if you bear in mind that, according to the latest  census, the number of inhabitants of that vast country amounts to two  hundred and fifty-three millions. Are all these two hundred and  fifty-three millions of human beings to be set down as liars, because  some hundreds, say even some thousands of Indians, when they are  brought to an English court of law, on suspicion of having committed a  theft or a murder, do not speak the truth, the whole truth, and  nothing but the truth? Would an English sailor, if brought before a  dark-skinned judge, who spoke English with a strange accent, bow down  before him and confess at once any misdeed that he may have committed;  and would all his mates rush forward and eagerly bear witness against  him, when he had got himself into trouble?    The rules of induction are general, but they depend on the subjects to  which they are applied. We may, to follow an Indian proverb, judge of  a whole field of rice by tasting one or two grains only, but if we  apply this rule to human beings, we are sure to fall into the same  mistake as the English chaplain who had once, on board an English  vessel, christened a French child, and who remained fully convinced  for the rest of his life that all French babies had very long noses.    I can hardly think of anything that you could safely predicate of  _all_ the inhabitants of India, and I confess to a little nervous  tremor whenever I see a sentence beginning with \"The people of India,\"  or even with \"All the Brahmans,\" or \"All the Buddhists.\" What follows  is almost invariably wrong. There is a greater difference between an  Afghan, a Sikh, a Hindustani, a Bengalese, and a Dravidian than  between an Englishman, a Frenchman, a German, and a Russian--yet all  are classed as Hindus, and all are supposed to fall under the same  sweeping condemnation.    Let me read you what Sir John Malcolm says about the diversity of  character to be observed by any one who has eyes to observe, among the  different races whom we promiscuously call Hindus, and whom we  promiscuously condemn as Hindus. After describing the people of Bengal  as weak in body and timid in mind, and those below Calcutta as the  lowest of our Hindu subjects, both in character and appearance, he  continues: \"But from the moment you enter the district of Behar, the  Hindu inhabitants are a race of men, generally speaking, not more  distinguished by their lofty stature and robust frame than they are  for some of the finest qualities of the mind. They are brave,  generous, humane, and their truth is as remarkable as their courage.\"    But because I feel bound to protest against the indiscriminating abuse  that has been heaped on the people of India from the Himalaya to  Ceylon, do not suppose that it is my wish or intention to draw an  ideal picture of India, leaving out all the dark shades, and giving  you nothing but \"sweetness and light.\" Having never been in India  myself, I can only claim for myself the right and duty of every  historian, namely, the right of collecting as much information as  possible, and the duty to sift it according to the recognized rules of  historical criticism. My chief sources of information with regard to  the national character of the Indians in ancient times will be the  works of Greek writers and the literature of the ancient Indians  themselves. For later times we must depend on the statements of the  various conquerors of India, who are not always the most lenient  judges of those whom they may find it more difficult to rule than to  conquer. For the last century to the present day, I shall have to  appeal, partly to the authority of those who, after spending an active  life in India and among the Indians, have given us the benefit of  their experience in published works, partly to the testimony of a  number of distinguished civil servants and of Indian gentlemen also,  whose personal acquaintance I have enjoyed in England, in France, and  in Germany.    As I have chiefly to address myself to those who will themselves be  the rulers and administrators of India in the future, allow me to  begin with the opinions which some of the most eminent, and, I  believe, the most judicious among the Indian civil servants of the  past have formed and deliberately expressed on the point which we are  to-day discussing, namely, the veracity or want of veracity among the  Hindus.    And here I must begin with a remark which has been made by others  also, namely, that the civil servants who went to India in the  beginning of this century, and under the auspices of the old East  India Company, many of whom I had the honor and pleasure of knowing  when I first came to England, seemed to have seen a great deal more of  native life, native manners, and native character than those whom I  had to examine five-and-twenty years ago, and who are now, after a  distinguished career, coming back to England. India is no longer the  distant island which it was, where each Crusoe had to make a home for  himself as best he could. With the short and easy voyages from England  to India and from India to England, with the frequent mails, and the  telegrams, and the Anglo-Indian newspapers, official life in India has  assumed the character of a temporary exile rather, which even English  ladies are now more ready to share than fifty years ago. This is a  difficulty which cannot be removed, but must be met, and which, I  believe, can best be met by inspiring the new civil servants with new  and higher interests during their stay in India.    I knew the late Professor Wilson, our Boden Professor of Sanskrit at  Oxford, for many years, and often listened with deep interest to his  Indian reminiscences.    Let me read you what he, Professor Wilson, says of his native friends,  associates, and servants:[17]        \"I lived, both from necessity and choice, very much among the      Hindus, and had opportunities of becoming acquainted with      them in a greater variety of situations than those in which      they usually come under the observation of Europeans. In the      Calcutta mint, for instance, I was in daily personal      communication with a numerous body of artificers, mechanics,      and laborers, and always found among them cheerful and      unwearied industry, good-humored compliance with the will of      their superiors, and a readiness to make whatever exertions      were demanded from them; there was among them no drunkenness,      no disorderly conduct, no insubordination. It would not be      true to say that there was _no_ dishonesty, but it was      comparatively rare, invariably petty, and much less      formidable than, I believe, it is necessary to guard against      in other mints in other countries. There was considerable      skill and ready docility. So far from there being any      servility, there was extreme frankness, and I should say that      where there is confidence without fear, frankness is one of      the most universal features in the Indian character. Let the      people feel sure of the temper and good-will of their      superiors, and there is an end of reserve and timidity,      without the slightest departure from respect....\"    Then, speaking of the much-abused Indian Pandits, he says: \"The  studies which engaged my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#9)"],[1,"   4.

CHAPTER IV    COMPOUNDS OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN; WATER AND HYDROGEN DIOXIDE      WATER    ~Historical.~ Water was long regarded as an element. In 1781 Cavendish  showed that it is formed by the union of hydrogen and oxygen. Being a  believer in the phlogiston theory, however, he failed to interpret his  results correctly. A few years later Lavoisier repeated Cavendish's  experiments and showed that water must be regarded as a compound of  hydrogen and oxygen.    ~General methods employed for the determination of the composition of a  compound.~ The composition of a compound may be determined by either of  two general processes these are known as _analysis_ and _synthesis_.    1. _Analysis_ is the process of decomposing a compound into its  constituents and determining what these constituents are. The analysis  is _qualitative_ when it results in merely determining what elements  compose the compound; it is _quantitative_ when the exact percentage of  each constituent is determined. Qualitative analysis must therefore  precede quantitative analysis, for it must be known what elements, are  in a compound before a method can be devised for determining exactly how  much of each is present.    2. _Synthesis_ is the process of forming a compound from its constituent  parts. It is therefore the reverse of analysis. Like analysis, it may be  either qualitative or quantitative.    ~Application of these methods to the determination of the composition of  water.~ The determination of the composition of water is a matter of  great interest not only because of the importance of the compound but  also because the methods employed illustrate the general methods of  analysis and synthesis.    ~Methods based on analysis.~ The methods based on analysis may be either  qualitative or quantitative in character.    [Illustration: Fig. 18]    1. _Qualitative analysis._ As was stated in the study of oxygen, water  may be separated into its component parts by means of the electric  current. The form of apparatus ordinarily used for effecting this  analysis is shown in Fig. 18. A platinum wire, to the end of which is  attached a small piece of platinum foil (about 15 mm. by 25 mm.), is  fused through each of the tubes B and D, as shown in the figure. The  stopcocks at the ends of these tubes are opened and water, to which has  been added about one tenth of its volume of sulphuric acid, is poured  into the tube A until the side tubes B and D are completely  filled. The stopcocks are then closed. The platinum wires extending into  the tubes B and D are now connected with the wires leading from two  or three dichromate cells joined in series. The pieces of platinum foil  within the tubes thus become the electrodes, and the current flows from  one to the other through the acidulated water. As soon as the current  passes, bubbles of gas rise from each of the electrodes and collect in  the upper part of the tubes. The gas rising from the negative electrode  is found to be hydrogen, while that from the positive electrode is  oxygen. It will be seen that the volume of the hydrogen is approximately  double that of the oxygen. Oxygen is more soluble in water than  hydrogen, and a very little of it is also lost by being converted into  ozone and other substances. It has been found that when the necessary  corrections are made for the error due to these facts, the volume of the  hydrogen is exactly double that of the oxygen.    Fig. 19 illustrates a simpler form of apparatus, which may be used in  place of that shown in Fig. 18. A glass or porcelain dish is partially  filled with water to which has been added the proper amount of acid. Two  tubes filled with the same liquid are inverted over the electrodes. The  gases resulting from the decomposition of the water collect in the  tubes.    [Illustration: Fig. 19]    2. _Quantitative analysis._ The analysis just described is purely  qualitative and simply shows that water contains hydrogen and oxygen. It  does not prove the absence of other elements; indeed it does not prove  that the hydrogen and oxygen are present in the proportion in which they  are liberated by the electric current. The method may be made  quantitative, however, by weighing the water decomposed and also the  hydrogen and oxygen obtained in its decomposition. If the combined  weights of the hydrogen and oxygen exactly equal the weight of the water  decomposed, then it would be proved that the water consists of hydrogen  and oxygen in the proportion in which they are liberated by the electric  current. This experiment is difficult to carry out, however, so that the  more accurate methods based on synthesis are used.    ~Methods based on synthesis.~ Two steps are necessary to ascertain the  exact composition of water by synthesis: (1) to show by qualitative  synthesis that water is formed by the union of oxygen with hydrogen; (2)  to determine by quantitative synthesis in what proportion the two  elements unite to form water. The fact that water is formed by the  combination of oxygen with hydrogen was proved in the preceding chapter.  The quantitative synthesis may be made as follows:    [Illustration: Fig. 20]    The combination of the two gases is brought about in a tube called a  eudiometer. This is a graduated tube about 60 cm. long and 2 cm. wide,  closed at one end (Fig. 20). Near the closed end two platinum wires are  fused through the glass, the ends of the wires within the tube being  separated by a space of 2 mm or 3 mm. The tube is entirely filled with  mercury and inverted in a vessel of the same liquid. Pure hydrogen is  passed into the tube until it is about one fourth filled. The volume of  the gas is then read off on the scale and reduced to standard  conditions. Approximately an equal volume of pure oxygen is then  introduced and the volume again read off and reduced to standard  conditions. This gives the total volume of the two gases. From this the  volume of the oxygen introduced may be determined by subtracting from  it the volume of the hydrogen. The combination of the two gases is now  brought about by connecting the two platinum wires with an induction  coil and passing a spark from one wire to the other. Immediately a  slight explosion occurs. The mercury in the tube is at first depressed  because of the expansion of the gases due to the heat generated, but at  once rebounds, taking the place of the gases which have combined to form  water. The volume of the water in the liquid state is so small that it  may be disregarded in the calculations. In order that the temperature of  the residual gas and the mercury may become uniform, the apparatus is  allowed to stand for a few minutes. The volume of the gas is then read  off and reduced to standard conditions, so that it may be compared with  the volumes of the hydrogen and oxygen originally taken. The residual  gas is then tested in order to ascertain whether it is hydrogen or  oxygen, experiments having proved that it is never a mixture of the two.  From the information thus obtained the composition of the water may be  calculated. Thus, suppose the readings were as follows:    Volume of hydrogen taken                                          20.3 cc.  Volume of hydrogen and oxygen                                     38.7  Volume of oxygen                                                  18.4  Volume of gas left after combination has taken place (oxygen)      8.3    The 20.3 cc. of hydrogen have combined with 18.4 cc. minus 8.3 cc. (or  10.1 cc.) of oxygen; or approximately 2 volumes of hydrogen have  combined with 1 of oxygen. Since oxygen is 15.88 times as heavy as  hydrogen, the proportion by weight in which the two gases combine is 1  part of hydrogen to 7.94 of oxygen.    ~Precaution.~ If the two gases are introduced into the eudiometer in the  exact proportions in which they combine, after the combination has taken  place the liquid will rise and completely fill the tube. Under these  conditions, however, the tube is very likely to be broken by the sudden  upward rush of the liquid. Hence in performing the experiment care is  taken to introduce an excess of one of the gases.    ~A more convenient form of eudiometer.~ A form of eudiometer (Fig. 21)  different from that shown on page 43 is sometimes used to avoid the  calculations necessary in reducing the volumes of the gases to the same  conditions of temperature and pressure in order to make comparisons.  With this apparatus it is possible to take the readings of the volumes  under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, and thus compare  them directly. The apparatus (Fig. 21) is filled with mercury and the  gases introduced into the tube A. The experiment is carried out as in  the preceding one, except that before taking the reading of the gas  volumes, mercury is"]]]
