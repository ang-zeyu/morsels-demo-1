Now from the very beginning the girl had wondered why her lover did not  come a-courting her as other girls' lovers came, openly and by day, and  though, at first, she paid no heed to her neighbours' nods and winks,  she began at last to think there might be something in what they said.  So she determined to see for herself, and one night when she heard her  husband come into her room, she lit her candle suddenly and saw him.    And, lo and behold! he was handsome as handsome; beautiful enough to  make every woman in the world fall in love with him on the spot. But  even as she got her glimpse of him, he changed into a big brown bird  which looked at her with eyes full of anger and blame.    \"Because you have done this faithless thing,\" it said, \"you will see me  no more, unless for seven long years and a day you serve for me  faithfully.\"    And she cried with tears and sobs, \"I will serve seven times seven years  and a day if you will only come back. Tell me what I am to do.\"    Then the bird-husband said, \"I will place you in service, and there you  must remain and do good work for seven years and a day, and you must  listen to no man who may seek to beguile you to leave that service. If  you do I will never return.\"    To this the girl agreed, and the bird, spreading its broad brown wings,  carried her to a big mansion.    \"Here they need a laundry-maid,\" said the bird-husband. \"Go in, ask to  see the mistress, and say you will do the work; but remember you must do  it for seven years and a day.\"    \"But I cannot do it for seven days,\" answered the girl. \"I cannot wash  or iron.\"    \"That matters nothing,\" replied the bird. \"All you have to do is to  pluck three feathers from under my wing close to my heart, and these  feathers will do your bidding whatever it may be. You will only have to  put them on your hand, and say, 'By virtue of these three feathers from  over my true love's heart may this be done,' and it will be done.\"    So the girl plucked three feathers from under the bird's wing, and after  that the bird flew away.    Then the girl did as she was bidden, and the lady of the house engaged  her for the place. And never was such a quick laundress; for, see you,  she had only to go into the wash-house, bolt the door and close the  shutters, so that no one should see what she was at; then she would out  with the three feathers and say, \"By virtue of these three feathers from  over my true love's heart may the copper be lit, the clothes sorted,  washed, boiled, dried, folded, mangled, ironed,\" and lo! there they came  tumbling on to the table, clean and white, quite ready to be put away.  So her mistress set great store by her and said there never was such a  good laundry-maid. Thus four years passed and there was no talk of her  leaving. But the other servants grew jealous of her, all the more so,  because, being a very pretty girl, all the men-servants fell in love  with her and wanted to marry her.    But she would have none of them, because she was always waiting and  longing for the day when her bird-husband would come back to her in  man's form.    Now one of the men who wanted her was the stout butler, and one day as  he was coming back from the cider-house he chanced to stop by the  laundry, and he heard a voice say, \"By virtue of these three feathers  from over my true love's heart may the copper be lit, the clothes  sorted, boiled, dried, folded, mangled, and ironed.\"    He thought this very queer, so he peeped through the keyhole. And there  was the girl sitting at her ease in a chair, while all the clothes came  flying to the table ready and fit to put away.    Well, that night he went to the girl and said that if she turned up her  nose at him and his proposal any longer, he would up and tell the  mistress that her fine laundress was nothing but a witch; and then, even  if she were not burnt alive, she would lose her place.    Now the girl was in great distress what to do, since if she were not  faithful to her bird-husband, or if she failed to serve her seven years  and a day in one service, he would alike fail to return; so she made an  excuse by saying she could think of no one who did not give her enough  money to satisfy her.    At this the stout butler laughed. \"Money?\" said he. \"I have seventy  pounds laid by with master. Won't that satisfy thee?\"    \"Happen it would,\" she replied.    So the very next night the butler came to her with the seventy pounds in  golden sovereigns, and she held out her apron and took them, saying she  was content; for she had thought of a plan. Now as they were going  upstairs together she stopped and said:    \"Mr. Butler, excuse me for a minute. I have left the shutters of the  wash-house open, and I must shut them, or they will be banging all night  and disturb master and missus!\"    Now though the butler was stout and beginning to grow old, he was  anxious to seem young and gallant; so he said at once:    \"Excuse me, my beauty, you shall not go. I will go and shut them. I  shan't be a moment!\"    So off he set, and no sooner had he gone than she out with her three  feathers, and putting them on her hand, said in a hurry:    \"By virtue of the three feathers from over my true love's heart may the  shutters never cease banging till morning, and may Mr. Butler's hands be  busy trying to shut them.\"    And so it happened.    Mr. Butler shut the shutters, but--bru-u-u! there they were hanging open  again. Then he shut them once more, and this time they hit him on the  face as they flew open. Yet he couldn't stop; he had to go on. So there  he was the whole livelong night. Such a cursing, and banging, and  swearing, and shutting, never was, until dawn came, and, too tired to be  really angry, he crept back to his bed, resolving that come what might  he would not tell what had happened to him and thus get the laugh on  him. So he kept his own counsel, and the girl kept the seventy pounds,  and laughed in her sleeve at her would-be lover.    Now after a time the coachman, a spruce middle-aged man, who had long  wanted to marry the clever, pretty laundry-maid, going to the pump to  get water for his horses overheard her giving orders to the three  feathers, and peeping through the keyhole as the butler had done, saw  her sitting at her ease in a chair while the clothes, all washed and  ironed and mangled, came flying to the table.    So, just as the butler had done, he went to the girl and said, \"I have  you now, my pretty. Don't dare to turn up your nose at me, for if you do  I'll tell mistress you are a witch.\"    Then the girl said quite calmly, \"I look on none who has no money.\"    \"If that is all,\" replied the coachman, \"I have forty pounds laid by  with master. That I'll bring and ask for payment to-morrow night.\"    So when the night came the girl held out her apron for the money, and as  she was going up the stairs she stopped suddenly and said, \"Goody me!  I've left my clothes on the line. Stop a bit till I fetch them in.\"    Now the coachman was really a very polite fellow, so he said at once:    \"Let me go. It is a cold, windy night and you'll be catching your  death.\"    So off he went, and the girl out with her feathers and said:    \"By virtue of the three feathers from over my true love's heart may the  clothes slash and blow about till dawn, and may Mr. Coachman not be able  to gather them up or take his hand from the job.\"    And when she had said this she went quietly to bed, for she knew what  would happen. And sure enough it did. Never was such a night as Mr.  Coachman spent with the wet clothes flittering and fluttering about his  ears, and the sheets wrapping him into a bundle, and tripping him up,  while the towels slashed at his legs. But though he smarted all over he  had to go on till dawn came, and then a very weary, woebegone coachman  couldn't even creep away to his bed, for he had to feed and water his  horses! And he, also, kept his own counsel for fear of the laugh going  against him; so the clever laundry-maid put the forty pounds with the  seventy in her box, and went on with her work gaily. But after a time  the footman, who was quite an honest lad and truly in love, going by the  laundry peeped through the keyhole to get a glimpse of his dearest dear,  and what should he see but her sitting at her ease in a chair, and the  clothes coming all ready folded and ironed on to the table.    Now when he saw this he was greatly troubled. So he went to his master  and drew out all his savings; and then he went to the girl and told her  that he would have to tell the mistress what he had seen, unless she  consented to marry him.    \"You see,\" he said, \"I have been with master this while back, and have  saved up this bit, and you have been here this long while back and must  have saved as well. So let us put the two together and make a home, or  else stay on at service as pleases you.\"    Well, she tried to put him off; but he insisted so much that at last she  said:    \"James! there's a dear, run down to the cellar and fetch me a drop of  brandy. You've made me feel so queer!\" And when he had gone she out  with her three feathers, and said, \"By virtue of the three feathers from  over my true love's heart may James not be able to pour the brandy  straight, except down his throat.\"    Well! so it happened. Try as he would, James could not get the brandy  into the glass. It splashed a few drops into it, then it trickled over  his hand, and fell on the floor. And so it went on and on till he grew  so tired that he thought he needed a dram himself. So he tossed off the  few drops and began again; but he fared no better. So he took another  little drain, and went on, and on, and on, till he got quite fuddled.  And who should come down into the cellar but his master to know what the  smell of brandy meant!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#9)"],[1,"that evil place designed only for Satan and his black companions.  He  accordingly, by means of his supernatural machinations, sent the poor  unfortunate man thither; and had he been sent by any other means than  those of Michael Scott, he would no doubt have met with a warm reception.  Out of pure spite to Michael, however, when Satan learned who was his  billet-master, he would no more receive him than he would receive the  Wife of Beth; and instead of treating the unfortunate man with the  harshness characteristic of him, he showed him considerable civilities.  Introducing him to his \"Ben Taigh,\" he directed her to show the stranger  any curiosities he might wish to see, hinting very significantly that he  had provided some accommodation for their mutual friend, Michael Scott,  the sight of which might afford him some gratification.  The polite  housekeeper accordingly conducted the stranger through the principal  apartments in the house, where he saw fearful sights.  But the bed of  Michael Scott!--his greatest enemy could not but feel satiated with  revenge at the sight of it.  It was a place too horrid to be described,  filled promiscuously with all the awful brutes imaginable.  Toads and  lions, lizards and leeches, and, amongst the rest, not the least  conspicuous, a large serpent gaping for Michael Scott, with its mouth  wide open.  This last sight having satisfied the stranger's curiosity, he  was led to the outer gate, and came away.  He reached his friends, and,  among other pieces of news touching his travels, he was not backward in  relating the entertainment that awaited his friend Michael Scott, as soon  as he would \"stretch his foot\" for the other world.  But Michael did not  at all appear disconcerted at his friend's intelligence.  He affirmed  that he would disappoint all his enemies in their expectations--in proof  of which he gave the following signs: \"When I am just dead,\" says he,  \"open my breast and extract my heart.  Carry it to some place where the  public may see the result.  You will then transfix it upon a long pole,  and if Satan will have my soul, he will come in the likeness of a black  raven and carry it off; and if my soul will be saved it will be carried  off by a white dove.\"    His friends faithfully obeyed his instructions.  Having exhibited his  heart in the manner directed, a large black raven was observed to come  from the east with great fleetness, while a white dove came from the west  with equal velocity.  The raven made a furious dash at the heart, missing  which, it was unable to curb its force, till it was considerably past it;  and the dove, reaching the spot at the same time, carried off the heart  amidst the rejoicing and ejaculations of the spectators.          THE MINISTER AND THE FAIRY.      Not long since, a pious clergyman was returning home, after administering  spiritual consolation to a dying member of his flock.  It was late of the  night, and he had to pass through a good deal of _uncanny_ land.  He was,  however, a good and a conscientious minister of the Gospel, and feared  not all the spirits in the country.  On his reaching the end of a lake  which stretched along the roadside for some distance, he was a good deal  surprised at hearing the most melodious strains of music.  Overcome by  pleasure and curiosity, the minister coolly sat down to listen to the  harmonious sounds, and try what new discoveries he could make with regard  to their nature and source.  He had not sat many minutes before he could  distinguish the approach of the music, and also observe a light in the  direction from whence it proceeded gliding across the lake towards him.  Instead of taking to his heels, as any faithless wight would have done,  the pastor fearlessly determined to await the issue of the phenomenon.  As  the light and music drew near, the clergyman could at length distinguish  an object resembling a human being walking on the surface of the water,  attended by a group of diminutive musicians, some of them bearing lights,  and others instruments of music, from which they continued to evoke those  melodious strains which first attracted his attention.  The leader of the  band dismissed his attendants, landed on the beach, and afforded the  minister the amplest opportunities of examining his appearance.  He was a  little primitive-looking grey-headed man, clad in the most grotesque  habit the clergyman had ever seen, and such as led him at once to suspect  his real character.  He walked up to the minister, whom he saluted with  great grace, offering an apology for his intrusion.  The pastor returned  his compliments, and, without further explanation, invited the mysterious  stranger to sit down by his side.  The invitation was complied with, upon  which the minister proposed the following question:--\"Who art thou,  stranger, and from whence?\"    To this question the fairy, with downcast eye, replied that he was one of  those sometimes called _Doane Shee_, or men of peace, or good men, though  the reverse of this title was a more fit appellation for them.  Originally  angelic in his nature and attributes, and once a sharer of the  indescribable joys of the regions of light, he was seduced by Satan to  join him in his mad conspiracies; and, as a punishment for his  transgression, he was cast down from those regions of bliss, and was now  doomed, along with millions of fellow-sufferers, to wander through seas  and mountains, until the coming of the Great Day.  What their fate would  be then they could not divine, but they apprehended the worst.  \"And,\"  continued he, turning to the minister, with great anxiety, \"the object of  my present intrusion on you is to learn your opinion, as an eminent  divine, as to our final condition on that dreadful day.\"  Here the  venerable pastor entered upon a long conversation with the fairy,  touching the principles of faith and repentance.  Receiving rather  unsatisfactory answers to his questions, the minister desired the  \"sheech\" to repeat after him the Paternoster, in attempting to do which,  it was not a little remarkable that he could not repeat the word \"art,\"  but said \"_wert_,\" in heaven.  Inferring from every circumstance that  their fate was extremely precarious, the minister resolved not to puff  the fairies up with presumptuous, and, perhaps, groundless expectations.  Accordingly, addressing himself to the unhappy fairy, who was all anxiety  to know the nature of his sentiments, the reverend gentleman told him  that he could not take it upon him to give them any hopes of pardon, as  their crime was of so deep a hue as scarcely to admit of it.  On this the  unhappy fairy uttered a shriek of despair, plunged headlong into the  loch, and the minister resumed his course to his home.          THE FISHERMAN AND THE MERMAN.      Of mermen and merwomen many strange stories are told in the Shetland  Isles.  Beneath the depths of the ocean, according to these stories, an  atmosphere exists adapted to the respiratory organs of certain beings,  resembling, in form, the human race, possessed of surpassing beauty, of  limited supernatural powers, and liable to the incident of death.  They  dwell in a wide territory of the globe, far below the region of fishes,  over which the sea, like the cloudy canopy of our sky, loftily rolls, and  they possess habitations constructed of the pearl and coral productions  of the ocean.  Having lungs not adapted to a watery medium, but to the  nature of atmospheric air, it would be impossible for them to pass  through the volume of waters that intervenes between the submarine and  supramarine world, if it were not for the extraordinary power they  inherit of entering the skin of some animal capable of existing in the  sea, which they are enabled to occupy by a sort of demoniacal possession.  One shape they put on, is that of an animal human above the waist, yet  terminating below in the tail and fins of a fish, but the most favourite  form is that of the larger seal or Haaf-fish; for, in possessing an  amphibious nature, they are enabled not only to exist in the ocean, but  to land on some rock, where they frequently lighten themselves of their  sea-dress, resume their proper shape, and with much curiosity examine the  nature of the upper world belonging to the human race.  Unfortunately,  however, each merman or merwoman possesses but one skin, enabling the  individual to ascend the seas, and if, on visiting the abode of man, the  garb be lost, the hapless being must unavoidably become an inhabitant of  the earth.    A story is told of a boat's crew who landed for the purpose of attacking  the seals lying in the hollows of the crags at one of the stacks.  The  men stunned a number of the animals, and while they were in this state  stripped them of their skins, with the fat attached to them.  Leaving the  carcasses on the rock, the crew were about to set off for the shore of  Papa Stour, when such a tremendous swell arose that every one flew  quickly to the boat.  All succeeded in entering it except one man, who  had imprudently lingered behind.  The crew were unwilling to leave a  companion to perish on the skerries, but the surge increased so fast,  that after many unsuccessful attempts to bring the boat close in to the  stack the unfortunate wight was left to his fate.  A stormy night came  on, and the deserted Shetlander saw no prospect before him but that of  perishing from cold and hunger, or of being washed into the sea by the  breakers which threatened to dash over the rocks.  At length, he  perceived many of the seals, who, in their flight had escaped the attack  of the boatmen, approach the skerry, disrobe themselves of their  amphibious hides, and resume the shape of the sons and daughters of the  ocean.  Their first object was to assist in the recovery of their  friends, who having been stunned by clubs, had, while in that state, been  deprived of their skins.  When the flayed"]]]
