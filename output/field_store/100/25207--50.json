This is what I can and what I must say today in the National  Parliament. [Cheers and applause.]      BULGARIAN PARLIAMENT REPLIES.    [As voted on Nov. 12, (25,) 1914.]    Your Majesty: The national representation considers it an agreeable  duty to express its satisfaction for the statements addressed to it  and to offer its collaboration to the Tsar and the Government for the  safeguard of the dear interests of the fatherland.    Your Majesty!    The breaking out of the terrible war which today oppresses and  exhausts the nations has stopped the peaceful activity in which the  Bulgarian Nation and your Government were engaged for the regeneration  of the national forces and the creation of new resources for the  prosperity of the country and the healing of the wounds of the long  and heroic war which the nation, with unflinching self-sacrifice, has  waged in the past year.    Your Majesty!    In the face of the momentous and far-reaching events now taking place  in Europe and around Bulgaria, the national representation has noted  with delight that the Government, having at heart the future of the  country when it declared the neutrality of Bulgaria, is maintaining  this attitude strictly and loyally, as the international necessities  and the most vital interests of the country demand.    Your Majesty!    The national representation has learned with joy that, thanks to this  attitude, the Government of your Majesty has preserved good and  friendly relations with all the great powers and has improved our  relations with our neighbors, which good relations are so necessary  for Bulgaria after the crisis of the last year, and during the events  of which we are the witnesses.    Your Majesty!    The great events that are shaking Europe are apt to call for our  attention, but, in spite of this, they will not stop us in the way of  the peaceful development of our culture, to which Bulgaria after the  war devoted her energies.    We will carefully examine and heartily approve of all the measures  which the Government may take for the progress of the country and will  give them our support.    Long live his Majesty the Tsar!    Long live her Majesty the Tsarina!    Long live his Royal Highness the Crown Prince!    _Following is the allocution of Tsar Ferdinand I., on Dec. 2, (15,)  1914, to the Delegation of the Sobranje, which brought to him the  Bulgarian Parliament's answer to the speech from the throne._    Gentlemen: It has always been agreeable to me to meet the  representatives of the National Parliament and exchange with them  ideas on the situation and the administration of the country. In the  present year, however, during the development of the events around us  this contact with the representatives of the people is not without  some importance for the Chief of the State.    I desire to hear from you, gentlemen, what are the concerns of the  nation and to partake of them with you. The thought that I am  nourishing, and my hope is, that, thanks to the stability and the  wisdom of the Bulgarians, the country will emerge from the new trials  untouched and without being threatened in the future.    I am really proud in duly acknowledging the virtues of the Bulgarian  people. When, in 1912, this people, moved by a single impulse, arose  and crushed a strong opponent by a force and ardor unsurpassed till  now, the whole world recognized its military virtues. But the  Bulgarian Nation has also displayed unique virtues in its reverses by  valiantly enduring the blows of misfortune.    This nation will warmly undertake its mission in order to achieve its  destiny, when it will win more respect on the part of foreigners than  it won by its victory; and the hearts of its sons, so devoted to the  fatherland, will be warmed anew.    Today, when the whole of Europe is burning and the conflagration is  approaching us, when all the nations around us are moving and making  ready for action, the Bulgarian Nation, duly appreciating the  situation, has established its attitude with an equanimity and a  reserve which constitute the undeniable proofs of its wisdom and its  political maturity.    The eyes of the Czar and of the people are turned toward you. In the  advices that you are giving, in the opinions that you express, I  observe your care for the national prosperity and your resolution to  sacrifice everything on the altar of the fatherland and for the  interests of the nation. This sets me at rest and inspires me with the  hope that in the future also complete harmony will prevail between the  nation and the Crown, and that from this harmony we shall draw the  necessary strength for the assurance of the future of Bulgaria.    May God watch over the fortunes of our fatherland and may He crown  with success our common efforts.      BULGARIA'S NEUTRALITY.    _In the last sitting of the Bulgarian Sobranje, just before the  Christmas holidays, the Premier, Mr. Radoslavoff, made the following  statements as they appear in the semi-official organ, Narodni Prava,  of Sofia:_    Since last July Bulgaria has maintained strict neutrality. Whatever  accusations have been addressed to her from abroad as to her alleged  breaches of neutrality, on the part of one or other of the belligerent  groups, are without any foundation whatever. It is recognized that  such insinuations come from our enemies, who have every interest in  our breaking neutrality.    The Government maintains and will maintain its neutral policy to the  end, and in this case we declare that we will adhere to it, and,  supported by the country, we will try to take as much advantage of it  as is possible.    Whether we are going to have or not to have a Ministry in which all  the political parties will be represented, this does not at all  interest those from abroad, where the dignified attitude of our  Government is recognized. Do not ask us to negotiate what the Triple  Entente is willing to give us, or to say to the central  powers--Austria and Germany--\"You, what are you going to give us?\"    Because in that case they would answer: \"Why should we give you  anything? For your inactivity? Because you keep tranquil, watching us  shedding our blood? Is it for this that we must give you something?\"    I, for myself, have repeated on another occasion that during these  critical moments, when new States are being founded while others are  falling to the ground, to safeguard and preserve the present frontiers  of Bulgaria is the greatest service that can be rendered her. We know  what we have asked and what was offered to us. But who guarantees that  we shall have what was orally promised to us? We ourselves cannot  guarantee it. I declare that we are on good terms with our neighbors  so long as they respect the interests of Bulgaria. If I knew that we  would receive Macedonia and Cavalla and Dobrudja, be sure that I,  first among all, would advise the formation of a coalition Ministry.    _Representative Tchandref_ (interrupting)--Go ahead and take them  alone.    _Radoslavoff_--But now we may not, neither in Chataldja nor in Cavalla  nor in Dobrudja. The Bulgarian Government is pursuing the absolute  preservation of peace and is watching developments. The friends that  we have, notwithstanding all evil machinations, have not deserted us.  Bulgaria still has friends, but friends and enemies tell us, Keep  quiet, Bulgarians! In this lies your safety!      A MILITARY ESTIMATE.    _The subjoined statement by the Bulgarian General, Savoff, appeared in  the Vienna Reichspost of Dec. 20, 1914:_    Taking into account the military operations up to this date, it is  easy to conclude that the two central monarchies are holding the  advantage of the Allies. Germany has demonstrated to the world her  enormous strength, while Austria-Hungary has shown herself to be  really a great power. Austria-Hungary must be proud of her army and of  the brilliant successes it has won against the colossal Russian  military organization.    _So far as the neutral States are concerned, Gen. Savoff said:_    Bulgaria will keep neutral as long as she can. The responsible factors  of the country will face every influence, and will act according to  the best interests of the fatherland. We must insist on the correction  of the mistakes made by the Treaty of Bucharest. We are resolved, in  case this should prove necessary, to take back by force of arms the  territories that belong to us and that have been snatched from us. The  Bulgarian Army is ready and will do its duty up to the end when the  interests of the country demand it.      OPPOSITION PARTY'S STATEMENT.    _Following is an editorial article published Oct. 15, (28,) 1914, in  the Mir, the organ of the Nationalists, and signed by A. Bouroff,  ex-Minister and ex-Vice President of the Bulgarian Parliament, or  Sobranje._    The Government knows that the Bulgarian people will never forgive it,  should the Ministry let pass the present historical opportunity  without securing important advantages for Bulgaria.    These advantages the Government is endeavoring to obtain by keeping a  pro-Austro-German neutrality. In order not to disclose this policy,  the Government avoids a discussion with Austria and Germany. In order  to render service to Austria the Government is courting Turkey,  provoking Russia through its action and its press, avoids the  constitution of a council of State demanded by the opposition, and  objects to the formation of a Ministry in which all the political  parties were to be represented. Perhaps the Government would go even  further, but it is prevented from doing so, on one hand by Rumania,  who maintained a puzzling position, and the probable surprises that  her \"friendly\" Turkey has in store, and on the other by the explicit  and general unwillingness of the Bulgarian people to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20523"],[0,"Religion and Art in Ancient Greece (#9)"],[1,"and majestic in a form free from all  sorrow, as the giver of life and livelihood and all good things, the  common father of men, their saviour and their guardian, so far as it is  possible for a mortal man to conceive and to copy his divine and  inexpressible nature. And consider whether you will not find the image  according with all the epithets of the god; Zeus alone is called the  father of gods and their only king, and also god of the city and of  friendship and society, and of suppliants too and strangers, the giver  of harvest, and by innumerable other titles. And for one whose aim it  was to display all these qualities without speaking, is not my art  successful? The strength of the form and its imposing proportions show  the power to rule and the king; the gentle and amiable character shows  the father and his care; the majesty and severity show the god of the  city and of law; and of the kinship of men and gods the similarity of  their shape serves as a symbol. His protective friendship of suppliants  and strangers and fugitives and such like is seen in his kindliness and  his evident gentleness and goodness. And an image of the giver of  possessions and harvest is seen in the simplicity and magnanimity  displayed in his form; he seems just like one who would give and be  generous of good things. All this, in short, I imitated as far as  possible, being unable to express it in speech.\" This description is, of  course, the work of a late and rhetorical author, but it is the work of  a man who was familiar with these great statues that are now lost to us,  and was capable of appreciating them. His criticism may not be so  thorough and subtle as the analysis of the Greek type of Zeus made by  Brunn in his _Gotteridealen_; but it is based on similar principles, the  observation of the physical type and the spiritual expression which  serves best to embody the majesty and benignity of the god. After all,  we come back perhaps to the saying of Phidias himself, and his quotation  from Homer; here, too, it is the brow of the god that is emphasised, and  the nod that shook Olympus while it granted a prayer. It is in such  effects rather than in any detailed description that it is possible to  realise the nature of a great work of art.    What success in the attainment of its aim was here reached by the art of  the sculptor may perhaps best be estimated from the often quoted  sentence of Quintilian, perhaps the noblest praise ever accorded to an  artist by a critic: \"The beauty of the statue even made some addition to  the received religion; the majesty of the work was equal to the god.\" We  might indeed, without irreverence, impute to Phidias the words uttered  in a very different sense by one who later gave a new and higher  interpretation to a formula of \"the received religion\" in Greece: \"Whom  therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you.\"    The other great Phidian ideal, that of Athena, was represented by  several statues, both in Athens and in other cities. As to these we have  a certain amount of information, and even a certain number of copies,  which show us the pose and the accessories of the various statues; some  of the better ones even suffice to give us some notion of the beauty of  their original. We have also descriptions by ancient writers, which tell  us, as in the case of the Olympian Zeus, much about the decoration of  the statue; but we have not in this case any appreciations of the effect  upon those who saw it. The ideal of Athena is in some ways more  difficult for us to comprehend than that of Zeus, partly because it is  less universally human, and more peculiarly characteristic of Greece and  even of Athens. The notion of the mother goddess is common to most  religions; that of the \"queen and huntress, chaste and fair\" is at least  familiar to us in literature, and readily commends itself to the  imagination. But Athena, though she has something of both these  characters, has a nature different from both. It is impossible to derive  her varied mythological functions from any one origin; but here it is  not the origin of her worship that concerns us, rather its meaning and  influence as these affected the people of her chosen city. Just as Zeus  was the ideal of all that was best in the Hellenic conception of manhood  and the god of a united Hellas, so Athena is especially the goddess of  Athens, the giver and fosterer of all those qualities that made the  Athenians what they were, the creatress of that ideal city sketched in  the wonderful speeches of Pericles. Her gifts are the arts of war and  peace, and all artistic and intellectual activity, as well as the olive  and other characteristic products of Attic soil, and the clear and  luminous air and stimulating climate which Attic writers are never tired  of extolling, and of associating with the peculiar genius of the  Athenian race. One can imagine how Dion Chrysostom might have recognised  the expression of these various qualities in the broad and majestic, yet  keenly intellectual brow, in the wide and clear eyes, and in other  features; but the extant copies of the Athena Parthenos cannot do more  than assist our imagination in realising how the sculptor represented  the goddess of Athens. Here, too, as in the case of the Zeus, it is  difficult for us to avoid the error of regarding the statue as a mere  philosophical abstraction, an impersonation of the qualities it  represents. Athena in later art, as set up in libraries and museums, was  doubtless such an impersonation, just as she is in modern art unreal and  comparatively uninteresting. But the Athenian believed intensely in the  existence of his goddess. He believed that the ceremonies connected with  her ancient image were necessary to the continuance of her favour to her  city and people, and that the new temples and statues set up in her  honour would still further delight her and ensure her protection and her  abode among her grateful worshippers. The statue by Phidias within the  Parthenon offered not merely that form in which she would choose to  appear if she showed herself to mortal eyes, but actually showed her  form as she had revealed it to the sculptor. To look upon such an image  helped the worshipper as much as--perhaps more than--any service or  ritual to bring himself into communion with the goddess, and to fit  himself, as a citizen of her chosen city, to carry out her will in  contributing his best efforts to its supremacy in politics, in  literature, and in art. If a work of art could have this actual  influence upon religious emotion, and through it upon practical life, it  may be said to have attained the utmost that any human effort can  achieve in the service of God.    The religious influence of art in the fifth century is, as we have seen,  closely associated with the state; the Athena Parthenos and the Olympian  Zeus appealed to their worshippers as citizens of Athens and as members  of the privileged Hellenic race. It would be easy to trace a similar  character in almost all the great statues of gods that are recorded as  belonging to this period. Thus the Dionysus of Alcamenes is not the  dreamy god of wine and pleasure that we find at a later age, but an  august figure, bearded and enthroned, the giver of the riches of the  earth and the wine, the god in whose honour all the great Dionysian  festivals were held; the same sculptor's Hermes is the guardian of ways  and gates, the giver of increase to flocks, not the youthful and  athletic messenger of the gods. Hephaestus, too, especially when  associated with Athena, is the patron and teacher of all handicrafts,  himself the ideal artisan, practical and genial, but with none of his  godhead lost in a too human individuality; even his  lameness--characteristic of the smith in all folk-lore--is lightly  indicated, not dwelt on as an interesting motive. Various statues of  particular gods may, of course, emphasise one side or another of their  functions. Athena may be worshipped and represented as goddess of  Victory or of Health; but here, too, it is usually some recognised state  cult that underlies the representation. Outside Athens we find the same  conditions. To take only one instance, the colossal gold and ivory Hera  of Argos, made by the chief Argive master Polyclitus, is the great  goddess of the city, just as Athena is of Athens. She was represented as  the bride of Zeus, who annually renewed her maidenhood at the great  Argive festival of the divine marriage; and we cannot doubt that  Polyclitus expressed in this statue, which was hardly less famous than  the masterpieces of Phidias, all the essential features of the great  religious ideals that underlay this primitive rite. His Hera had neither  the warlike nor the intellectual and spiritual characteristics of the  Attic Athena; but she was the goddess of womanly grace and beauty in the  bride, and embodied that perfection of physical form which Argive art  sought also in its athletic figures, and which was in a sense a part of  the religion that found expression in the great athletic games. Some  gods--Apollo, for example--seem in fifth-century statues to have a more  individual character. Just as in earlier times the name Apollo serves to  cover a multitude of statues of which some may be meant to represent  individual men, so even in the age of Phidias we sometimes meet with a  figure of athletic type or of youthful beauty as to which it is possible  to doubt whether it is an Apollo; this may be partly the result of the  great popularity of the type in all ages of Greek sculpture which led to  its more rapid development and earlier individualisation. But the Apollo  of this period is never the mere dreamy youth of later time; it has been  well said that he is the god who, in the mythical athletic contest,  could surpass Hermes in the foot-race and Ares in boxing; the embodiment  of all-round physical and"]]]
