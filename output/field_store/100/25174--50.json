We must remember, however, that in this instance the keepers  were not men of book-learning, but hardy warriors who carried the  _cathach_ into battle as a charm and an incitement to victory.    Of similar shrines, which were made for precious books by both the  Greeks and Lombards, the oldest and most famous is that made for  Theudelinde, wife of Agilulf, King of the Lombards, and given by her, in  616, together with the famous iron crown and other relics, to the  Cathedral of Monza, where they are still to be seen.    The enrichment of the covers of books themselves, as distinct from the  use of cases or shrines, has been usual in almost all ages and styles of  decoration. When we come to speak of Carolingian MSS. we shall find  several remarkable instances.    We must now pass on from this curiously attractive theme of Celtic  calligraphy to its contemporary styles of France, Germany, Spain, and  Italy, only remarking by the way that no other style of its time had so  marked an influence on the local _scriptoria_ into which it was  introduced as this same Celtic of Ireland. It is not only traceable, but  easily recognised all along the Rhine, in Burgundy, the Swiss Cantons,  and Lombardy, until at length overwhelmed by the general introduction of  Romanesque or Byzantine, which was restored and filtered through the  Exarchate and the Lombard schools during the early days of the new  Carolingian Empire.          CHAPTER VIII    SEMI-BARBARIC ILLUMINATION    Visigothic--Merovingian--Lombardic--Extinction of classic art--Splendid  reign of Dagobert--St. Eloy of Noyon--The Library of Laon--Natural  History of Isidore of Seville--Elements of contemporary art--Details of  ornament--Symbolism--Luxeuil and Monte Cassino--Sacramentary of  Gellone--\"Prudentius\"--\"Orosius\"--Value of the Sacramentary of Gellone.      To reach the beginning's of these various degenerate and illiterate  attempts at book-work we have only to watch the last expiring gleams of  classic art beneath the ruthless footsteps of the barbarian invaders of  the old Roman Empire.    In the sixth century the light of the old civilisation was fast fading  away. Perhaps we may look upon the so-called splendour of the reign of  Dagobert in France as the spasmodic scintillations of its latest moments  of existence. The kingdom of Dagobert, after 631, was almost an empire.  For the seven years preceding his death, in 638, he ruled from the Elbe  and the Saxon frontier to that of Spain, and from the Atlantic Ocean to  the confines of Hungary. It was during his reign that we read of the  skill in metal-work of the celebrated St. Eloy of Noyon, the rival of  our own St. Dunstan.    St. Eloy or Eligius (588-659) began his artistic career as the pupil of  Abbo, the goldsmith and mint-master to Chlothaire II., and rose from the  rank of a goldsmith to that of Bishop of Noyon. Among his handiwork were  crowns, chalices, and crosiers, and he is reputed to have made the chair  of bronze-gilt now in the National Library at Paris, called the  _fauteuil_ of Dagobert, and many other works, which disappeared either  during the wars of Louis XV. or those of the Revolution of 1789. He  founded the Abbey of Solignac, near Limoges, and it is not improbable  that the reputation of this city for metal-work and enamelling may be  dated from his foundation. With such works as those of Eloy before them,  it is difficult to believe that the wretched and puerile attempts at  ornamental penmanship and illumination which are shown at Laon and other  places as the work of this period can possibly represent the highest  efforts of the calligrapher. But we must remember that St. Eloy was an  extraordinary genius in his art, and that the bulk of the clergy, not to  mention ordinary workmen, were very ignorant and ill-taught. Very few,  indeed, were men who could be considered cultured. Gregory of Tours, the  historian, and Venantius Fortunatus, the hymn-writer, are among the few.    In the Library at Laon, M. Fleury describes a MS. of the Natural History  of Isidore of Seville, which is looked upon as a work of reference both  as regards art and learning. It was at one time a very popular book,  being a Latin cyclopædia, dealing with the sciences and general  knowledge of the time; yet the example referred to by M. Fleury shows us  only a crowd of initials learnedly styled by the Benedictine authors and  others \"ichthio-morphiques\" and \"ornithoeides,\" _i.e._ made up of fishes  and birds, and about equal in quality and finish to the efforts of a  very ordinary schoolboy.    These initials betray an utter decadence from the beautiful uncials of  the fifth and sixth centuries, seen in the St. Germain's Psalter, for  example, now in the National Library at Paris. The colours are coarse  and badly applied, and even where brightest are utterly unrefined and  without taste.    Notwithstanding, however, the apparently total eclipse or extinction of  Roman art in Gaul, or, as it must henceforth be called, France, it is  claimed by M. Fleury[13] that the interlacements which constitute the  principal feature of these earlier Merovingian MSS. are derived from the  remains of Roman mosaics found profusely at Blanzy, Bazoches, and Reims.  This may be so, but those mosaics would not account for the same  features in the Irish work, for the Romans never reached Ireland as  occupants or colonists.    [13] See later.    Take another example from the Laon collection, the History of Orosius.  The first page is a type of the species to which it belongs, and,  moreover, a good sample of the earliest efforts of all pictorial art. An  ordinary rectangular cross occupies the centre of the page. The centre  shows us the Lamb of the Apocalypse and St. John. On the arms are the  beasts which typify the Evangelists--their emblems, as they are  sometimes called. We notice that they are all symbolic, and not intended  to be natural imitations of reality. The various animals scattered about  the page are all symbolic--all have a mystical interpretation and  _raison d'être_. A border-frame, passing behind each extremity of the  cross, contains a number of dog-like animals, some plain, others  spotted, while the body of the cross itself is occupied with attempts at  foliage ornaments. In the left upper corner are the letters \"X P I,\" in  the right \"I H V,\" thick foliage springing from the \"I\" and \"V\" and  falling back over the monogram. In the lower corners are two fishes and  two doves, each pair hanging to a penwork chain.    The emblem of John, on the upper extremity of the cross, is an  eagle-headed and winged man holding a book; its opposite one of Lucas at  foot is a singularly conceived anthropoid and winged ox, also with a  book. On the left Marcus, whose head is indescribable; and on the right  Matthew, with human head, the rest of the figures being as before. The  eye in all the figures is a most remarkable feature. Both in the  pictures and the initials of this MS. the outline has been drawn in  black ink, and the colours yellow, red, brown, and green applied  afterwards.    As the new masters of the West were not so much interested in the  artistic remains of the mangled civilisation they were endeavouring to  destroy as in mastery and military success, it was left for the  monasteries and the church to see to the welfare of books and monuments.    In the seventh century it was the monasteries that saved almost all we  know of the preceding centuries. During the turmoil of the period from  the fifth to the eighth century we find certain quiet corners where  learning and the arts still breathed, grew, and dwelt in security.  Lérins, founded by St. Honoratus of Aries; Luxeuil by Columbanus, Bobbio  his last retreat; and, above all, Monte Cassino, the great pattern of  monasticism, the Rule of whose founder was destined to become the basis  of all later Orders, were each of them steadily labouring to rescue the  civilisation daily threatened by the ravage of war, and to preserve it  for the benefit of the ignorant hordes who, because of their ignorance,  now only aimed at its entire destruction. We have seen how these monks  and clerics, with more goodwill than ability, did their best to adorn  the books which came into their hands. It is a poor show, but there is  no better. It is absolutely our only record of how civilisation managed  to struggle through the storm.    Let us, then, be thankful even for the Laon \"Orosius,\" for the  Sacramentary of Gellone, and the Mozarabic Liturgies of Puy. They are  among the links between ancient and mediæval art.    As already stated, the handwriting of Merovingian MSS. is mainly an  adaptation of the Roman uncial, as it is in Irish and Lombardic, or, we  might say, everywhere else. Abbreviations we still uncommon. Where  minuscules are used, the writing is not quite so legible as in the  larger hands, but we are not met by the singular difficulties of some of  the Lombardic texts.    A few solitary texts of the earliest time are in capitals, such as the  really handsome \"Prudentius\" of the Paris National Library, where the  entire text of the great Christian poet is boldly inscribed in the  centre of a large white page of vellum, like a series of separate  inscriptions. The first few words are \"rubrished\" in the antique manner.  The MS. is supposed to date previous to the year 527. A little later  than this St. Columbanus founded the monastery of Luxeuil, and later  still, viz. in 616, that of Bobbio.    If we turn to the Visigothic area, including the South of France and the  entire peninsula of Spain, our first and typical example is the  celebrated Sacramentary of Gellone. This MS. dates, it is said, from the  eighth century. It is written throughout in Visigothic uncials, though  executed in the South of France. Its ornamentation is frankly barbaric.

It must now be apparent that such use of the voice as is necessitated  by speaking for the public, or by singing, still more, perhaps, must  tend to the general welfare of the body--_i.e._, the hygiene of  respiration is evident from the physiology. Actual experience proves  this to be the case. The author has known the greatest improvement in  health and vigor follow on the judicious use of the voice, owing  largely to a more active respiration. It also follows, however, that  exhaustion may result from the excessive use of the respiratory  muscles, as with any others, even when the method of chest-expansion  is quite correct. Before condemning any vocal method one does well to  inquire in regard to the extent to which it has been employed, as well  as the circumstances of the voice-user. A poor clergyman worried with  the fear of being supplanted by another man, or a singer unable to  secure employment, possibly from lack of means to advertise himself,  is not likely to grow fat under any method of vocal exercise, be it  ever so physiological; while the prima donna who has chanced to please  the popular taste and become a favorite may \"wax fat and kick.\"    [Illustration: FIGS. 14, A and B, are to be compared: that on the left  shows the position of the diaphragm, abdominal walls, etc., during  expiration; the one on the right, during inspiration. The relative  quantities of air in the chest in each case are approximately  indicated by the shaded areas.]          CHAPTER IV.    BREATHING FURTHER CONSIDERED THEORETICALLY AND PRACTICALLY.      When one takes into account the large number of muscles employed in  respiration, and remembers that these muscles must act in perfect  harmony with each other if the great end is to be attained, he  naturally inquires how this complex series of muscular contractions  has been brought into concerted action so as to result in that  physiological unity known as breathing.    It is impossible to conceive of such results being effected except  through the influence of the nervous system, which acts as a sort of  regulator throughout the whole economy. All the parts of the  respiratory tract are supplied with nerves, which are of both  kinds--those which carry nervous impulses or messages from and those  which convey them to the nervous centres concerned; in other words, to  and from the bodies of the nerve-cells whose extensions are termed  nerves. These centres are the central offices where the information is  received and from which orders are issued, so to speak.    The chief respiratory centre--_the_ centre--is situated in that  portion of the brain just above the spinal cord, in its continuation,  in fact, and is known as the _medulla oblongata_, or _bulb_. But  while this is the head centre, at which the ingoing (_afferent_)  impulses are received and from which the outgoing (_efferent_) ones  proceed, it makes use of many other collections of nerve-cells, or  subordinate centres--_e.g._, those whose nerve-extensions or  nerve-fibres proceed from the spinal cord to the muscles of  respiration.    [Illustration: FIG. 15. The purpose of this diagram is to indicate the  relation between ingoing (afferent) and outgoing (efferent) nervous  influences (impulses)--in other words, to illustrate _reflex action_.  The paths of the ingoing impulses are indicated by black lines, and  those of the outgoing ones by red lines, the point of termination  being shown by an arrow-tip. The result of an ingoing message may be  either favorable or unfavorable. The nervous impulse that reaches the  brain through the eye may be either exhilarating or depressing. The  experienced singer is usually stimulated by the sight of an audience,  while the beginner may be rendered nervous, and this may express  itself in many and widely distant parts of the body. An unfavorable  message may reach the diaphragm or intercostal muscles, and render  breathing shallow, irregular, or, in the worst cases, almost gasping.  The heart or stomach, even the muscles of the larynx, the limbs, etc.,  may be affected, and trembling be the result. On the other hand, the  laryngeal and other muscles may be toned up, and the voice rendered  better than usual, as a result of applause--_i.e._, by nervous  impulses through the ear--or, again, by the sight of a friend. Even a  very tight glove or a pinching shoe may suffice to hamper the action  of the muscles required for singing or speaking. All this is a result  of reflex action--_i.e._, outgoing messages set up by ingoing  ones--the \"centre\" being either the brain or the spinal cord. From all  this it is evident that the singer or speaker must guard against  everything unfavorable, to an extent that an ordinary person need not.  The stomach, as the diagram is also meant to show, may express itself  on the brain, and give rise, as in fact it often does, owing to  indiscretion in eating, to unpleasant outward effects on the muscles  required in singing or speaking. Of course, no attempt has been made  in the above figure to express anatomical forms and relations  exactly.]    When all the ingoing impulses from the lungs, etc., are cut off, if  respiration does not actually cease, it is carried out in a way so  ineffective that life cannot be long sustained. It follows that as the  muscular contractions necessary for the chest and other respiratory  movements are dependent on the impulses passing in from the lungs,  etc., breathing belongs to the class of movements known as  reflex--chiefly so, at all events. It will thus be seen that  respiration is a sort of self-regulative process, the movements being  in proportion to the needs of the body. The greater the need for  oxygen, the more are the nerve-terminals in the lungs and the centre  itself stimulated, with, as a result, corresponding outgoing impulses  to muscles.    As the respiratory centre is readily reached by impulses from every  part of the body, like one who keeps open house, there are many  different sorts of visitors, not all desirable. If, for example, a  drop of a fluid that produces no special effect when on the tongue  gets into the larynx, trachea, or lungs, the most violent coughing  follows. This is one illustration of the _protective_ character of  many reflexes. This violent action of the respiratory apparatus is  not in itself a desirable thing, because it disturbs if it does not  exhaust, but it is preferable to the inflammation that might result if  the fluid, a bread-crumb, etc., were to pass into the lungs.    In like manner, the deep breath and the \"Oh!\" that follow a  fear-inspiring sight, a very loud noise, or a severe pinch of the  skin, are examples of reflex action. They are quite independent of the  will, though in some cases they may be prevented by it.    This reflex nature of breathing throws much light on many matters of  great interest to the speaker and singer, some of which, as the  formation of good habits of breathing, will be considered later.  Unfortunately for the nervous debutant, his breathing is anything but  what he could wish it. The pale face and almost gasping respiration,  in the worst cases, are not unknown to the experienced observer. In  such cases the preventive (_inhibitory_) influence of certain ingoing  impulses is but too obvious. Such undesirable messages may pass in  through the eyes when the young singer looks out on the throng that  may either approve or condemn; or they may originate within, and pass  from the higher part of the brain to the lower breathing centre. The  beginner may have high ideals of art, and fear that they will be but  ill realized in his performance. His ideals in this instance do not  help but hinder, for they interfere with the regular action of the  breathing centre. A few deep breaths after the platform has been  reached greatly help under such circumstances. It is also wise for the  singer to avoid those songs that begin softly and require long breaths  and very evenly sustained tones. It is much better to begin with a  selection that brings the breathing organs into fairly active exercise  at once. One feeble, hesitating, or otherwise ineffective tone is in  itself a stimulus of the wrong kind, sending in unfavorable messages  which are only too apt to reach the breathing and other centres  concerned in voice-production; but of this subject of nervousness  again.    It is important to realize that sounds, whether musical or the  reverse, are produced by the outgoing stream of breath, by an  expiratory effort. Breath is taken in by the voice-producer in order  to be converted into that expiratory force which, playing on the vocal  bands, causes them to vibrate or pass into the rapid movements which  give rise to similar movements of the air in the cavities above the  larynx, the resonance-chambers, and on which the final result as  regards sound is dependent. Important as is inspiration to the speaker  and singer, expiration is much more so. Many persons fill the lungs  well, but do not understand how to husband their resources, and so  waste breath instead of converting every particle into sound, so to  speak. After the larynx has been studied the importance of the  expiratory blast will be better understood.    For the voice-user, it cannot be too soon realized that _all breath  that does not become sound is wasted_, or, to express the same truth  otherwise, the sole purpose of breathing is to cause effective  vibrations of the vocal bands. In these two words, _effective  vibrations_, lies the whole secret of voice production, the whole  purpose of training, the key to the highest technical results, the  cause of success or failure for those who speak or sing.    Before the larynx, the apparatus that produces sound-vibrations, can  be effectively employed, the source of power, the"]]]
