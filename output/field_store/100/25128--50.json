The parliament had allowed, that  all foreign priests, belonging to the two queens, should be excepted,  and that a permission for them to remain in England should still be  granted. In the proclamation, the word foreign was purposely omitted;  and the queens were thereby authorized to give protection to as many  English priests as they should think proper.    That the king might reap some advantage from his compliances, however  fallacious, he engaged the commons anew into an examination of his  revenue, which, chiefly by the negligence in levying it, had proved, he  said, much inferior to the public charges. Notwithstanding the price of  Dunkirk, his debts, he complained, amounted to a considerable sum; and  to satisfy the commons that the money formerly granted him had not been  prodigally expended, he offered to lay before them the whole account of  his disbursements. It is, however, agreed on all hands, that the king,  though during his banishment he had managed his small and precarious  income with great order and economy, had now much abated of these  virtues, and was unable to make his royal revenues suffice for his  expenses. The commons, without entering into too nice a disquisition,  voted him four subsidies; and this was the last time that taxes were  levied in that manner.    Several laws were made this session with regard to trade. The militia  also came under consideration, and some rules were established for  ordering and arming it. It was enacted, that the king should have no  power of keeping the militia under arms above fourteen days in the year.  The situation of this island, together with its great naval power, has  always occasioned other means of security, however requisite, to be much  neglected among us: and the parliament showed here a very superfluous  jealousy of the king's strictness in disciplining the militia. The  principles of liberty rather require a contrary jealousy.    The earl of Bristol's friendship with Clarendon, which had subsisted,  with great intimacy, during their exile and the distresses of the royal  party, had been considerably impaired, since the restoration, by the  chancellor's refusing his assent to some grants which Bristol had  applied for to a court lady: and a little after, the latter nobleman,  agreeably to the impetuosity and indiscretion of his temper, broke out  against the minister in the most outrageous manner. He even entered  a charge of treason against him before the house of peers; but had  concerted his measures so imprudently, that the judges, when consulted,  declared, that neither for its matter nor its form could the charge  be legally received. The articles indeed resemble more the incoherent  altercations of a passionate enemy, than a serious accusation, fit to be  discussed by a court of judicature; and Bristol himself was so  ashamed of his conduct and defeat, that he absconded during some time.  Notwithstanding his fine talents, his eloquence, his spirit, and his  courage, he could never regain the character which he lost by this hasty  and precipitate measure.    But though Clarendon was able to elude this rash assault, his credit  at court was sensibly declining; and in proportion as the king found  himself established on the throne, he began to alienate himself from  a minister whose character was so little suited to his own. Charles's  favor for the Catholics was always opposed by Clarendon, public liberty  was secured against all attempts of the over-zealous royalists, prodigal  grants of the king were checked or refused, and the dignity of his own  character was so much consulted by the chancellor, that he made it an  inviolable rule, as did also his friend Southampton, never to enter into  any connection with the royal mistresses. The king's favorite was Mrs.  Palmer, afterwards created duchess of Cleveland; a woman prodigal,  rapacious, dissolute, violent, revengeful. She failed not in her turn  to undermine Clarendon's credit with his master; and her success was  at this time made apparent to the whole world. Secretary Nicholas, the  chancellor's great friend, was removed from his place; and Sir Harry  Bennet, his avowed enemy, was advanced to that office. Bennet was soon  after created Lord Arlington.    Though the king's conduct had hitherto, since his restoration, been  in the main laudable, men of penetration began to observe, that those  virtues by which he had at first so much dazzled and enchanted the  nation, had great show, but not equal solidity. His good understanding  lost much of its influence by his want of application his bounty was  more the result of a facility of disposition than any generosity of  character; his social humor led him frequently to neglect his dignity;  his love of pleasure was not attended with proper sentiment and decency;  and while he seemed to bear a good will to every one that approached  him, he had a heart not very capable of friendship, and he had secretly  entertained a very bad opinion and distrust of mankind. But above all,  what sullied his character in the eyes of good judges, was his negligent  ingratitude towards the unfortunate cavaliers, whose zeal and sufferings  in the royal cause had known no bounds. This conduct, however, in the  king may, from the circumstances of his situation and temper, admit of  some excuse; at least, of some alleviation. As he had been restored more  by the efforts of his reconciled enemies than of his ancient friends,  the former pretended a title to share his favor; and being from practice  acquainted with public business, they were better qualified to execute  any trust committed to them. The king's revenues were far from being  large, or even equal to his necessary expenses; and his mistresses, and  the companions of his mirth and pleasures, gained by solicitation every  request from his easy temper. The very poverty to which the more zealous  royalists had reduced themselves, by rendering them insignificant, made  them unfit to support the king's measures, and caused him to deem them  a useless encumbrance. And as many false and ridiculous claims of merit  were offered, his natural indolence, averse to a strict discussion  or inquiry, led him to treat them all with equal indifference. The  parliament took some notice of the poor cavaliers. Sixty thousand  pounds were at one time distributed among them; Mrs. Lane also and the  Penderells had handsome presents and pensions from the king. But the  greater part of the royalists still remained in poverty and distress,  aggravated by the cruel disappointment in their sanguine hopes, and by  seeing favor and preferment bestowed upon their most inveterate foes.  With regard to the act of indemnity and oblivion, they universally said,  that it was an act of indemnity to the king's enemies and of oblivion to  his friends.            CHAPTER LXIV.          CHARLES II.    {1664.} The next session of parliament discovered a continuance of the  same principles which had prevailed in all the foregoing. Monarchy and  the church were still the objects of regard and affection. During no  period of the present reign did this spirit more evidently pass the  bounds of reason and moderation.    The king, in his speech to the parliament, had ventured openly to demand  a repeal of the triennial act; and he even went so far as to declare  that, notwithstanding the law, he never would allow any parliament to  be assembled by the methods prescribed in that statute. The parliament,  without taking offence at this declaration, repealed the law; and in  lieu of all the securities formerly provided, satisfied themselves with  a general clause, \"that parliament should not be interrupted above three  years at the most.\" As the English parliament had now raised itself to  be a regular check and control upon royal power, it is evident that they  ought still to have preserved a regular security for their meeting,  and not have trusted entirely to the good will of the king, who, if  ambitious or enterprising, had so little reason to be pleased with these  assemblies. Before the end of Charles's reign, the nation had occasion  to feel very sensibly the effects of this repeal.    By the act of uniformity, every clergyman who should officiate without  being properly qualified, was punishable by fine and imprisonment: but  this security was not thought sufficient for the church. It was now  enacted, that, wherever five persons above those of the same household  should assemble in a religious congregation, every one of them was  liable, for the first offence, to be imprisoned three months, or pay  five pounds; for the second, to be imprisoned six months, or pay ten  pounds; and for the third, to be transported seven years, or pay a  hundred pounds. The parliament had only in their eye the malignity of  the sectaries; they should have carried their attention further, to the  chief cause of that malignity, the restraint under which they labored.    The commons likewise passed a vote, that the wrongs, dishonors, and  indignities offered to the English by the subjects of the United  Provinces, were the greatest obstructions to all foreign trade: and they  promised to assist the king with their lives and fortunes in asserting  the rights of his crown against all opposition whatsoever. This was  the first open step towards a Dutch war. We must explain the causes and  motives of this measure.    That close union and confederacy which, during a course of near seventy  years, has subsisted, almost without interruption or jealousy, between  England and Holland, is not so much founded on the natural, unalterable  interests of these states, as on their terror of the growing power of  the French monarch, who, without their combination, it is apprehended,  would soon extend his dominion over Europe. In the first years of  Charles's reign, when the ambitious genius of Lewis had not as yet  displayed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#9)"],[1,"of the council of war,  who had resolved to abandon the place, that they threatened immediate  vengeance. Cunningham and Richards retired to their ships, and Lundy  locked himself in his chamber. In vain did Walker and major Baker exhort  him to maintain his government. Such was his cowardice or treachery,  that he absolutely refused to be concerned in the defence of the place,  and he was suffered to escape in disguise with a load of match upon his  back; but he was afterwards apprehended in Scotland, from whence he was  sent to London to answer for his perfidy or misconduct.          COURAGEOUS DEFENCE.    After his retreat, the townsmen chose Mr. Walker and major Baker for  their governors, with joint authority; but this office they would  not undertake until it had been offered to colonel Cunningham, as the  officer next in command to Lundy. He rejected the proposal, and with  Richards returned to England, where they were immediately cashiered. The  two new governors, thus abandoned to their fate, began to prepare for  a vigorous defence; indeed their courage seems to have transcended  the bounds of discretion, for the place was very ill fortified; their  cannon, which did not exceed twenty pieces, were wretchedly mounted;  they had not one engineer to direct their operations; they had a very  small number of horse; the garrison consisted of people unacquainted  with military discipline; they wore destitute of provisions; they were  besieged by a king in person, at the head of a formidable army, directed  by good officers, and supplied with all the necessary implements for a  siege or battle. This town was invested on the twentieth day of April;  the batteries were soon opened, and several attacks were made with great  impetuosity; but the besiegers were always repulsed with considerable  loss. The townsmen gained divers advantages in repeated sallies, and  would have held their enemies in the utmost contempt, had they not been  afflicted with a contagious distemper, as well as reduced to extremity  by want of provisions. They were even tantalized in their distress;  for they had the mortification to see some ships which had arrived  with supplies from England, prevented from sailing up the river by the  batteries the enemy had raised on both sides, and a boom with which they  had blocked up the channel. At length a reinforcement arrived in the  Lough, under the command of general Kirke, who had deserted his master  and been employed in the service of king William. He found means to  convey intelligence to Walker, that he had troops and provisions on  board for their relief, but found it impracticable to sail up the river:  he promised, however, that he would land a body of forces at the Inch,  and endeavour to make a diversion in their favour-, when joined by the  troops at Inniskilling, which amounted to five thousand men, including  two thousand cavalry. He said he expected six thousand men from England,  where they were embarked before he set sail. He exhorted them to  persevere in their courage and loyalty, and assured them he would come  to their relief at all hazards. These assurances enabled them to bear  their miseries a little longer, though their numbers daily diminished.  Major Baker dying, his place was filled with colonel Michel-burn, who  now acted as colleague to Mr. Walker.          CRUELTY OF ROSENE.    King James having returned to Dublin to be present at the parliament,  the command of his army devolved to the French general Rosene, who was  exasperated at such an obstinate opposition by a handful of half-starved  militia. He threatened to raze the town to its foundations, and destroy  the inhabitants without distinction of age or sex, unless they would  immediately submit themselves to their lawful sovereign. The governors  treated his menaces with contempt, and published an order that no  person, on pain of death, should talk of surrendering. They had now  consumed the last remains of their provisions, and supported life by  eating the flesh of horses, dogs, cats, rats, mice, tallow, starch,  and salted hides, and even this loathsome food began to fail. Rosene,  finding him deaf to all his proposals, threatened to wreak his vengeance  on all the protestants of that country, and drive them under the walls  of Londonderry, where they should be suffered to perish by famine. The  bishop of Meath being informed of this design, complained to king James  of the barbarous intention, entreating his majesty to prevent its being  put in execution. That prince assured him that he had already ordered  Rosene to desist from such proceeding: nevertheless, the Frenchman  executed his threats with the utmost rigour. Parties of dragoons  were detached on this cruel service: after having stripped all the  protestants for thirty miles round, they drove these unhappy people  before them like cattle, without even sparing the enfeebled old men,  nurses with infants at their breasts, tender children, women just  delivered, and some even in the pangs of labour. Above four thousand of  these miserable objects were driven under the walls of Londonderry. This  expedient, far from answering the purpose of Rosene, produced quite  a contrary effect. The besieged were so exasperated at this act of  inhumanity, that they resolved to perish rather than submit to such  a barbarian. They erected a gibbet in sight of the enemy, and sent a  message to the French general, importing that they would hang all the  prisoners they had taken during the siege, unless the protestants whom  they had driven under the walls should be immediately dismissed. This  threat produced a negotiation, in consequence of which the protestants  were released after they had been detained three days without tasting  food. Some hundreds died of famine or fatigue; and those who lived to  return to their own habitations, found them plundered and sacked by the  papists, so that the greater number perished for want, or were murdered  by the straggling parties of the enemy; yet these very people had for  the most part obtained protections from king James, to which no respect  was paid by his general.          THE PLACE IS RELIEVED BY KIRKE    The garrison of Londonderry was now reduced from seven to five thousand  seven hundred men, and these were driven to such extremity of distress,  that they began to talk of killing the popish inhabitants and feeding on  their bodies. In this emergency Kirke, who had hitherto lain inactive,  ordered two ships laden with provisions to sail up the river under  convoy of the Dartmouth frigate. One of them, called the Mountjoy, broke  the enemy's boom; and all the three, after having sustained a very hot  fire from both sides of the river, arrived in safety at the town to  the inexpressible joy of the inhabitants. The army of James were so  dispirited by the success of this enterprise, that they abandoned the  siege in the night and retired with precipitation, after having  lost about nine thousand men before the place. Kirke no sooner took  possession of the town, than Walker was prevailed upon to embark  for England with an address of thanks from the inhabitants to their  majesties for the seasonable relief they had received.          THE INNISKILLINEES DEFEAT AND TAKE GENERAL MACARTY.    The Inniskilliners were no less remarkable than the people of  Londonderry for the valour and perseverance with which they opposed the  papists. They raised twelve companies, which they regimented under the  command of Gustavus Hamilton, whom they chose for their governor. They  proclaimed William and Mary on the eleventh day of March, and resolved  in a general council to maintain their title against all opposition. The  lord Gilmoy invested the castle of Groin belonging to the protestants  in the neighbourhood of Inniskilling, the inhabitants of which threw  succours into the place, and compelled Gilmoy to retire to Belturbet. A  detachment of the garrison, commanded by lieutenant-colonel Lloyd, took  and demolished the castle of Aughor, and they gained the advantage in  several skirmishes with the enemy. On the day that preceded the relief  of Londonderry, they defeated six thousand Irish papists at a place  called Newton-Butler, and took their commander Macarty, commonly called  lord Moncashel.          MEETING OF THE IRISH PARLIAMENT.    The Irish parliament being assembled at Dublin, according to the  proclamation of king James, he, in a speech from the throne, thanked  them for the zeal, courage, and loyalty they had manifested; extolled  the generosity of the French king, who had enabled him to visit them in  person; insisted upon executing his design of establishing liberty of  conscience as a step equally agreeable to the dictates of humanity and  discretion, and promised to concur with them in enacting such laws as  would contribute to the peace, affluence, and security of his subjects.  Sir Richard Neagle, being chosen speaker of the commons, moved for an  address of thanks to his majesty, and that the count D'Avaux should be  desired to make their acknowledgments to the most christian king for  the generous assistance he had given to their sovereign. These addresses  being drawn up with the concurrence of both houses, a bill was brought  in to recognize the king's title, to express their abhorence of the  usurpation by the prince of Orange, as well as of the defection of the  English. Next day James published a declaration, complaining of the  calumnies which his enemies had spread to his prejudice; expatiating  upon his own impartiality in preferring his protestant subjects;  his care in protecting them from their enemies, in redressing their  grievances, and in granting liberty of conscience; promising that he  would take no step but with the approbation of parliament; offering a  free pardon to all persons who should desert his enemies and join with  him in four-and-twenty days after his landing in Ireland,"]]]
