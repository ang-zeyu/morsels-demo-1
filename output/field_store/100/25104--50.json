The result is that here  you can procure a good dinner with the best of wines, which being  consumed, so to say, on the spot where they have matured, are in  perfection both as to flavour and condition.    The Hotel Restaurant du Chapon Fin, under the management of MM. Dubois  and Mendionde, is perhaps the best in the town. Here an excellent dinner  _a la carte_ is to be had and the service is _tres soignee_. The cellar  comprises the finest wines of the Gironde, Lafite, Haut Brion, Latour,  Margaux Leoville, etc., with Pommery, Mumm, Cliquot as champagnes. But  to my idea, any one asking for champagne at Bordeaux would order a pork  pie at Strasbourg. The Chapon Fin is fairly expensive, but good food and  good Lafite are not given away. The appointments of the hotel are  excellent.    The Cafe de Bordeaux is a more popular establishment with brilliant  decorations, and if you do not wish for an _a la carte_ dinner, you are  provided with a very good \"set\" _dejeuner_ for 4 francs. Dinner can be  had for 5 francs, with a concert thrown in.    Another good hotel and restaurant with fairly moderate terms is the  Bayonne, also boasting of a fine cellar of wine and service _a la  carte_. In fact many people aver that at the Bayonne one can get as  good if not a better dinner than at any other restaurant in Bordeaux.    The Hotel des Princes et de la Paix has the Restaurant Sansot attached  to it, which is quite good.    The Restaurant de Paris, situated on the lovely Promenade des Allees de  Tourny, is a first-class establishment with very moderate prices, where  a capital _dejeuner_ can be obtained for 2 francs 50 centimes, or a  dinner for 3 francs. The proprietor, Mons. Debreuil, was _chef_ at some  of the best cafes in Paris, and he has a _clientele_ of many well-known  epicures in Bordeaux.    All these restaurants have saloons for private parties in case you  require them.    The principal _specialite_ of Bordeaux, besides claret, is lampreys,  which, when cooked _a la Bordelaise_, are about as rich and luscious a  dish as a most ardent candidate for a bilious attack can desire. If you  are there in the autumn, don't forget to order _Cepes a la Bordelaise_.    To the above of my worthy _confrere_, I would only add that the Chapon  Fin is a winter garden, somewhat resembling the Champeaux Restaurant in  Paris; there are rockeries and ferns, and a great tree-trunk runs up to  the roof, the foliage and branches being no doubt outside. A speciality  is the _Potage Chapon Fin_, a vegetable soup which is excellent. The  restaurant of the Bayonne is in a great conservatory. Judging from the  few meals I have eaten at each, I should class the Chapon Fin and the  Bayonne as being equal in cookery. The first floor of the Cafe de  Bordeaux is now decorated with mirrors and white walls, after the  manner of the _chic_ Parisian restaurants, but the Englishman who wishes  to drink whisky and soda there--an unholy taste in a wine country--and  who demands a special brand and Schweppe's soda, should ask how much he  is going to be charged for it before he commits himself.      Arcachon    Of cooking at Arcachon there is nothing in particular to be said. The  place has a celebrity for its oyster-beds, and a great number of the  oysters we eat in England have been transplanted from the bay at  Arcachon to the beds in British waters.      Biarritz    The average of cookery in the hotels at Biarritz is very good, for the  competition is very keen, and as money is spent by the handful in this  town on the bay where the Atlantic rolls in its breakers, any hotel  which did not provide two excellent _table-d'hote_ meals would very soon  be out of the running. In the basement of the building in which is the  big Casino, \"Mons. Boulant's Casino,\" as the natives call it, is a  restaurant where a _table-d'hote_ lunch and dinner are served; but _the_  restaurant of Biarritz is the one which Ritz has established on the  first floor of the little Casino, the Casino Municipal, where one  breakfasts in a glazed-in verandah overlooking the Plage and the  favourite bathing-spot, and at dinner one looks across to the  illuminated terrace of the other Casino. The decoration of this  restaurant is of the simplest but at the same time of the most effective  kind, being of growing bamboos which form green canopies above the  tables. Biarritz depends but little on the surrounding country for its  food, as the Pays Basque gives few good things to the kitchen. Fish is  the one excellent thing that Biarritz itself contributes to all the  menus, and the _Friture du Pays_ is always excellent. Here is a menu of  a little dinner for three at the Ritz. The _Minestrone_ is an excellent  Italian soup (which, by the way, Oddenino of the Imperial in London  makes better than I have tasted it anywhere else out of Italy); the  veal, I fancy, came from Paris, the _ortolans_ from the far south:--                    Melon.           Minestron Milanaise.             Friture du Pays.      Carre de Veau braise aux Cepes.           Ortolans a la broche.             Salade de Romaine.              Coupes d'Entigny.    I have not kept any bill for this, but I know that I regarded the total  as moderate in a town where all things in September are at gambler's  prices. The Royalty, in the main street at Biarritz, is the afternoon  gathering place for the young bloods, who there drink cooling liquids  through straws out of long tumblers, while the ladies hold their  parliament at tea-time in Miremont the confectioner's.      Marseilles    Once more I step down from the platform to give place to my colleague  A.B.    Two of the best hotels in Marseilles, with restaurants attached to them,  are the Noailles and the Hotel du Louvre; the latter is owned and  supervised by Mons. Echenard, who with Mons. Ritz helped to create the  popularity of the Savoy Restaurant in London, and is also his coadjutor  in the management of the Carlton Restaurant; it is needless to remark  that any cuisine that Mons. Echenard takes in hand is worthy of  attention. Mons. Echenard has lately acquired the Reserve at  Marseilles--a very pretty cafe and garden about half-an-hour's drive  from the Cannebiere, along the Corniche Road; it stands in a commanding  position, with a lovely view of the bay and the surrounding mountains.  It has furnished apartments attached to it, and for any one having to  stay at Marseilles, either while waiting for the _Messageries Maritimes_  liner or for the arrival of a yacht, it is infinitely preferable to the  hot, stuffy town, and would be an excellent winter quarter. Like many  similar seaside cafes abroad, it has its own _parc au coquillages_ or  shell-fish tanks, and you here get the world-renowned _Bouillabaisse_ in  perfection.    The best shell-fish are the _praires_ and the _clovisses_, about the  same size as walnuts or little neck clams; the _clovisses_ are the  largest, and rather take the place of oysters when the latter are not in  season, in the same way the clam does in America; others are mussels,  oysters, and _langoustes_. _Langoustes_ differ as much as a skinny fowl  from a _Poularde de Mans_. Mons. Echenard gets his from Corsica, and you  then learn how they can vary. He has also a _Poularde Reserve en Cocotte  Raviolis_, which is a dish to be remembered; and a small fat sole caught  between Hyeres and Toulon is not to be despised.    I am free to confess that the _Tutti Frutti de la Mare_, or stew  consisting of the many lovely and variegated small fish that are caught  in those waters, has no charm for me. Personally, I would as soon eat a  surprise packet of pins, but of course, _chacun a son gout_. Anyway, if  you are stranded in Marseilles for an afternoon or longer, you could go  to many a worse place than the Reserve.    I suppose it is not necessary for me to add to A.B.'s discourse any  description of what _Bouillabaisse_ is, or how the Southerners firmly  believe that this dish cannot be properly made except of the fish that  swim in the Mediterranean, the rascaz, a little fellow all head and  eyes, being an essential in the savoury stew, along with the eel, the  lobster, the dory, the mackerel, and the girelle. Thackeray has sung the  ballad of the dish as he used to eat it, and his _recette_, because it  is poetry, is accepted, though it is but the fresh-water edition of the  stew. If you do not like oil, garlic, and saffron, which all come into  its composition, give it a wide berth. The _Brandade_, which is a  cod-fish stew and a regular fisherman's dish, is by no means to be  despised.    Before leaving the subject of Marseilles and its cookery and  restaurants, let me record the verdict of a true gourmet and Englishman  who always lives the winter through in Marseilles. He writes me that in  Marseilles itself there are no restaurants worthy of the name, the best  being Isnard's (Hotel des Phoceens), Rue Thubaneau, and another good one  that of the Hotel d'Orleans, Rue Vacon, where the proprietor and the  cook are brothers and charming people.    Those adventurous souls who wish to eat the fry of sea-urchins and other  highly savoury dishes, with strange shell-fish and other extraordinary  denizens of the deep as their foundation, should go to Bregaillon's at  the Vieux Port. It is necessary to have a liking for garlic and a nose  that fears no smells for this adventure; but if you bring your courage  to the sticking point, order a dozen _oursins_, a _petit poelon_, which  is a _tournedos_ in a _casserole_, and a _grive_. Cassis is the white  wine of the house;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#9)"],[1,"vinegar, in fact, every possible and impossible  drug--finally, all the materials for working the Ruhmkorff coil!    My uncle had also been careful to lay in a goodly supply of tobacco,  several flasks of very fine gunpowder, boxes of tinder, besides a large  belt crammed full of notes and gold. Good boots rendered watertight were  to be found to the number of six in the tool box.    \"My boy, with such clothing, with such boots, and such general  equipment,\" said my uncle, in a state of rapturous delight, \"we may hope  to travel far.\"    It took a whole day to put all these matters in order. In the evening we  dined with Baron Trampe, in company with the Mayor of Reykjavik, and  Doctor Hyaltalin, the great medical man of Iceland. M. Fridriksson was  not present, and I was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor  did not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the  island. Unfortunately, the consequence was, that I did not understand a  word that was said at dinner--a kind of semiofficial reception. One  thing I can say, my uncle never left off speaking.    The next day our labor came to an end. Our worthy host delighted my  uncle, Professor Hardwigg, by giving him a good map of Iceland, a most  important and precious document for a mineralogist.    Our last evening was spent in a long conversation with M. Fridriksson,  whom I liked very much--the more that I never expected to see him or  anyone else again. After this agreeable way of spending an hour or so, I  tried to sleep. In vain; with the exception of a few dozes, my night was  miserable.    At five o'clock in the morning I was awakened from the only real half  hour's sleep of the night by the loud neighing of horses under my  window. I hastily dressed myself and went down into the street. Hans was  engaged in putting the finishing stroke to our baggage, which he did in  a silent, quiet way that won my admiration, and yet he did it admirably  well. My uncle wasted a great deal of breath in giving him directions,  but worthy Hans took not the slightest notice of his words.    At six o'clock all our preparations were completed, and M. Fridriksson  shook hands heartily with us. My uncle thanked him warmly, in the  Icelandic language, for his kind hospitality, speaking truly from the  heart.    As for myself I put together a few of my best Latin phrases and paid him  the highest compliments I could. This fraternal and friendly duty  performed, we sallied forth and mounted our horses.    As soon as we were quite ready, M. Fridriksson advanced, and by way of  farewell, called after me in the words of Virgil--words which appeared  to have been made for us, travelers starting for an uncertain  destination:    \"Et quacunque viam dederit fortuna sequamur.\"    (\"And whichsoever way thou goest, may fortune follow!\")          CHAPTER 9    OUR START--WE MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY      The weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous  and perilous journey. We had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor  drenching rain. It was, in fact, real tourist weather.    As there was nothing I liked better than horse exercise, the pleasure of  riding through an unknown country caused the early part of our  enterprise to be particularly agreeable to me.    I began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling, a life of  desire, gratification and liberty. The truth is, that my spirits rose so  rapidly, that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be  a terrible journey.    \"After all,\" I said to myself, \"what do I risk? Simply to take a journey  through a curious country, to climb a remarkable mountain, and if the  worst comes to the worst, to descend into the crater of an extinct  volcano.\"    There could be no doubt that this was all this terrible Saknussemm had  done. As to the existence of a gallery, or of subterraneous passages  leading into the interior of the earth, the idea was simply absurd, the  hallucination of a distempered imagination. All, then, that may be  required of me I will do cheerfully, and will create no difficulty.    It was just before we left Reykjavik that I came to this decision.    Hans, our extraordinary guide, went first, walking with a steady, rapid,  unvarying step. Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own  accord, without requiring whip or spur. My uncle and I came behind,  cutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.    Iceland is one of the largest islands in Europe. It contains thirty  thousand square miles of surface, and has about seventy thousand  inhabitants. Geographers have divided it into four parts, and we had to  cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called Sudvestr  Fjordungr.    Hans, on taking his departure from Reykjavik, had followed the line of  the sea. We took our way through poor and sparse meadows, which made a  desperate effort every year to show a little green. They very rarely  succeed in a good show of yellow.    The rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of  the horizon, through the misty fogs; every now and then some heavy  flakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light, while certain  lofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds, their  summits clearly visible above, like jagged reefs rising from a troublous  sea.    Every now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground,  leaving us scarcely room to pass. Our horses, however, appeared not only  well acquainted with the country, but by a kind of instinct, knew which  was the best road. My uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging  forward his steed by whip, spur, or voice. It was utterly useless to  show any signs of impatience. I could not help smiling to see him look  so big on his little horse; his long legs now and then touching the  ground made him look like a six-footed centaur.    \"Good beast, good beast,\" he would cry. \"I assure you, that I begin to  think no animal is more intelligent than an Icelandic horse. Snow,  tempest, impracticable roads, rocks, icebergs--nothing stops him. He is  brave; he is sober; he is safe; he never makes a false step; never  glides or slips from his path. I dare to say that if any river, any  fjord has to be crossed--and I have no doubt there will be many--you  will see him enter the water without hesitation like an amphibious  animal, and reach the opposite side in safety. We must not, however,  attempt to hurry him; we must allow him to have his own way, and I  will undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a  day.\"    \"We may do so,\" was my reply, \"but what about our worthy guide?\"    \"I have not the slightest anxiety about him: that sort of people go  ahead without knowing even what they are about. Look at Hans. He moves  so little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued. Besides, if  he were to complain of weariness, he could have the loan of my horse. I  should have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some  sort of exercise. My arms are right--but my legs are getting a little  stiff.\"    All this while we were advancing at a rapid pace. The country we had  reached was already nearly a desert. Here and there could be seen an  isolated farm, some solitary bur, or Icelandic house, built of wood,  earth, fragments of lava--looking like beggars on the highway of life.  These wretched and miserable huts excited in us such pity that we felt  half disposed to leave alms at every door. In this country there are no  roads, paths are nearly unknown, and vegetation, poor as it was, slowly  as it reached perfection, soon obliterated all traces of the few  travelers who passed from place to place.    Nevertheless, this division of the province, situated only a few miles  from the capital, is considered one of the best cultivated and most  thickly peopled in all Iceland. What, then, must be the state of the  less known and more distant parts of the island? After traveling fully  half a Danish mile, we had met neither a farmer at the door of his hut,  nor even a wandering shepherd with his wild and savage flock.    A few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally. What, then, must  we expect when we come to the upheaved regions--to the districts broken  and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions?    We were to learn this all in good time. I saw, however, on consulting  the map, that we avoided a good deal of this rough country, by following  the winding and desolate shores of the sea. In reality, the great  volcanic movement of the island, and all its attendant phenomena, are  concentrated in the interior of the island; there, horizontal layers or  strata of rocks, piled one upon the other, eruptions of basaltic origin,  and streams of lava, have given this country a kind of supernatural  reputation.    Little did I expect, however, the spectacle which awaited us when we  reached the peninsula of Sneffels, where agglomerations of nature's  ruins form a kind of terrible chaos.    Some two hours or more after we had left the city of Reykjavik, we  reached the little town called Aoalkirkja, or the principal church. It  consists simply of a few houses--not what in England or Germany we  should call a hamlet.    Hans stopped here one half hour. He shared our frugal breakfast,  answered Yes, and No to my uncle's questions as to the nature of the  road, and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as  laconic as usual.    \"Gardar!\" was his one-worded reply.    I took occasion to consult the map, to see where Gardar was to be found.  After looking keenly I found a small town of that name on the borders of  the Hvalfjord, about four miles from Reykjavik. I pointed this out to my  uncle, who made a very energetic grimace.    \"Only four miles out of twenty-two? Why it is only a little walk.\"    He was about to make some energetic observation to the guide, but Hans,  without"]]]
