After all, why should the intensity of the solar radiation upon Venus be  regarded as inimical to life? The sunbeams awaken life.    It is not impossible that relative nearness to the sun may be an  advantage to Venus from the biologic point of view. She gets less than  one third as much heat as Mercury receives on the average, and she gets  it with almost absolute uniformity. At aphelion Mercury is about two and  four tenths times hotter than Venus; then it rushes sunward, and within  forty-four days becomes six times hotter than Venus. In the meantime the  temperature of the latter, while high as compared with the earth's,  remains practically unchanged. Not only may Mercury's temperature reach  the destructive point, and thus be too high for organic life, but  Mercury gets nothing with either moderation or constancy. It is a world  both of excessive heat and of violent contrasts of temperature. Venus,  on the other hand, presents an unparalleled instance of invariableness  and uniformity. She may well be called the favorite of the sun, and,  through the advantages of her situation, may be stimulated by him to  more intense vitality than falls to the lot of the earth.    It is open, at least to the writers of the interplanetary romances now  so popular, to imagine that on Venus, life, while encompassed with the  serenity that results from the circular form of her orbit, and the  unchangeableness of her climates, is richer, warmer, more passionate,  more exquisite in its forms and more fascinating in its experiences,  keener of sense, capable of more delicious joys, than is possible to it  amid the manifold inclemencies of the colder earth.    We have seen that there is excellent authority for saying that Venus's  atmosphere is from one and a half to two times as dense and as extensive  as ours. Here is an interesting suggestion of aerial possibilities for  her inhabitants. If man could but fly, how would he take to himself  wings and widen his horizons along with the birds! Give him an  atmosphere the double in density of that which now envelopes him, take  off a little of his weight, thereby increasing the ratio of his strength  and activity, put into his nervous system a more puissant stimulus from  the life-giving sun, and perchance he _would_ fly.    Well, on Venus, apparently, these very conditions actually exist. How,  then, do intellectual creatures in the world of Venus take wing when  they choose? Upon what spectacle of fluttering pinions afloat in  iridescent air, like a Raphael dream of heaven and its angels, might we  not look down if we could get near enough to our brilliant evening star  to behold the intimate splendors of its life?    As Venus herself would be the most brilliant member of the celestial  host to an observer stationed on the night side of Mercury, so the earth  takes precedence in the midnight sky of Venus. For the inhabitants of  Venus Mercury is a splendid evening and morning star only, while the  earth, being an outer planet, is visible at times in that part of the  sky which is directly opposite to the place of the sun. The light  reflected from our planet is probably less dazzling than that which  Venus sends to us, both because, at our greater distance, the sunlight  is less intense, and because our rarer atmosphere reflects a smaller  proportion of the rays incident upon it. But the earth is, after all, a  more brilliant phenomenon seen from Venus than the latter is seen from  the earth, for the reason that the entire illuminated disk of the earth  is presented toward our sister planet when the two are at their nearest  point of approach, whereas, at that time, the larger part of the surface  of Venus that is turned earthward has no illumination, while the  illuminated portion is a mere crescent.    Owing, again, to the comparative rarity of the terrestrial atmosphere,  it is probable that the inhabitants of Venus--assuming their  existence--enjoy a superb view of the continents, oceans, polar snows,  and passing clouds that color and variegate the face of the earth. Our  astronomers can study the full disk of Venus only when she is at her  greatest distance, and on the opposite side of the sun from us, where  she is half concealed in the glare. The astronomers of Venus, on the  other hand, can study the earth under the most favorable conditions of  observation--that is to say, when it is nearest to them and when, being  in opposition to the sun, its whole disk is fully illuminated. In fact,  there is no planet in the entire system which enjoys an outlook toward a  sister world comparable with that which Venus enjoys with regard to the  earth. If there be astronomers upon Venus, armed with telescopes, it is  safe to guess that they possess a knowledge of the surface of the earth  far exceeding in minuteness and accuracy the knowledge that we possess  of the features of any heavenly body except the moon. They must long ago  have been able to form definite conclusions concerning the meteorology  and the probable habitability of our planet.    It certainly tends to increase our interest in Venus when, granting  that she is inhabited, we reflect upon the penetrating scrutiny of which  the earth may be the object whenever Venus--as happens once every 584  days--passes between us and the sun. The spectacle of our great planet,  glowing in its fullest splendor in the midnight sky, pied and streaked  with water, land, cloud, and snow, is one that might well excite among  the astronomers of another world, so fortunately placed to observe it,  an interest even greater than that which the recurrence of total solar  eclipses occasions upon the earth. For the inhabitants of Venus the  study of the earth must be the most absorbing branch of observational  astronomy, and the subject, we may imagine, of numberless volumes of  learned memoirs, far exceeding in the definiteness of their conclusions  the books that we have written about the physical characteristics of  other members of the solar system. And, if we are to look for attempts  on the part of the inhabitants of other worlds to communicate with us by  signals across the ether, it would certainly seem that Venus is the  most likely source of such efforts, for from no other planet can those  features of the earth that give evidence of its habitability be so  clearly discerned. Of one thing it would seem we may be certain: if  Venus has intellectual inhabitants they possess far more convincing  evidence of our existence than we are likely ever to have of theirs.    In referring to the view of the earth from Mercury it was remarked that  the moon is probably visible to the naked eye. From Venus the moon is  not only visible, but conspicuous, to the naked eye, circling about the  earth, and appearing at times to recede from it to a distance of about  half a degree--equal to the diameter of the full moon as we see it. The  disk of the earth is not quite four times greater in diameter than that  of the moon, and nowhere else in the solar system is there an instance  in which two bodies, no more widely different in size than are the moon  and the earth, are closely linked together. The moons of the other  planets that possess satellites are relatively so small that they  appear in the telescope as mere specks beside their primaries, but the  moon is so large as compared with the earth that the two must appear, as  viewed from Venus, like a double planet. To the naked eye they may look  like a very wide and brilliant double star, probably of contrasted  colors, the moon being silvery white and the earth, perhaps, now of a  golden or reddish tinge and now green or blue, according to the part of  its surface turned toward Venus, and according, also, to the season that  chances to be reigning over that part.    Such a spectacle could not fail to be of absorbing interest, and we can  not admit the possibility of intelligent inhabitants on Venus without  supposing them to watch the motions of the moon and the earth with the  utmost intentness. The passage of the moon behind and in front of the  earth, and its eclipses when it goes into the earth's shadow, could be  seen without the aid of telescopes, while, with such instruments, these  phenomena would possess the highest scientific interest and importance.    Because the earth has a satellite so easily observable, the astronomers  of Venus could not remain ignorant of the exact mass of our planet, and  in that respect they would outstrip us in the race for knowledge, since,  on account of the lack of a satellite attending Venus, we have been able  to do no more than make an approximate estimate of her mass.    With telescopes, too, in the case of a solar eclipse occurring at the  time of the earth's opposition, they could see the black spot formed by  the shadow of the moon, where the end of its cone moved across the earth  like the point of an invisible pencil, and could watch it traversing  continents and oceans, or thrown out in bold contrast upon the white  background of a great area of clouds. Indeed, the phenomena which our  globe and its satellite present to Venus must be so varied and wonderful  that one might well wish to visit that planet merely for the sake of  beholding them.    Thus far we have found so much of brilliant promise in the earth's twin  sister that I almost hesitate to approach another phase of the subject  which may tend to weaken the faith of some readers in the habitability  of Venus. It may have been observed that heretofore nothing has been  said as to the planet's rotation period, but, without specifically  mentioning it, I have tacitly assumed the correctness of the generally  accepted period of about twenty-four hours, determined by De Vico and  other observers. This period, closely accordant with the earth's, is, as  far as it goes, another argument for the habitability of Venus.    But now it must"]]]
