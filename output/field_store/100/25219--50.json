After a little a curious sound is heard across  the plain. The clang becomes louder, coming nearer to us, and tall, dark  ghosts pass by with silent steps. Only bells are heard. The ghosts are  camels coming from Persia with carpets, cotton, and fruit. There are  more than three hundred of them, and it is a long time before the road  is clear again. And all the time there is a ringing as from a chime of  bells.    For many thousands of years the same sound has been heard on the caravan  routes. It is the same with the roar of the waters of the Euphrates and  Tigris. Mighty powers have flourished and passed away on their banks,  whole peoples have died out, of Babylon and Nineveh only ruins are left;  but the waters of the rivers murmur just the same, and the caravan bells  ring now as in the days when Alexander led the Macedonian army over the  Euphrates and Tigris, when the Venetian merchant Marco Polo travelled  620 years ago between Tabriz and Trebizond by the road we are now  driving along, when Timur the Lame defeated the Turks and by this road  carried the Sultan Bayazid in an iron cage to exhibit him like a wild  beast in the towns of Asia.    A white morning cloud seems to be floating over the grey mountains to  the east, but when the sun rises it is seen to be a cone as regular as  the roof of an Armenian church. It is the snow-capped top of Mount  Ararat, where the ark landed when the great flood went down. The summit  is always covered with snow, for the mountain is a thousand feet higher  than Mont Blanc.    Now we are not far from the frontier, where Kurdish brigands render the  country unsafe, but once over the border into Persian territory there is  no danger. We are now in the north-western corner of Persia, in the  province of Azerbeijan, which is populated mainly by Tatars. The capital  of the province is Tabriz, once the chief market for the trade of all  northern Persia with Europe. Here goods were collected from far and  near, packed in mats of bast and bound with ropes so as to form bales,  which were laden on fresh camels and carried in fourteen days to  Trebizond.    Now not more than a fifth part of this trade remains, but still the  caravan life is the same, and as varied as ever. The Tatar leader rides  in front; beside every seventh camel walks a caravan man, who wears a  black lambskin cap, a blue frockcoat, a girdle round the waist, and  pointed shoes. Each is armed with a dagger, for the Tatars are often at  feud with the Turks and Armenians, and the dagger has a groove on each  side of the blade to allow the blood of the victim to run off. Many a  caravan leader has spent the greater part of his life in travelling to  and fro between Tabriz and Trebizond. On every journey he has seen  Ararat to the north of the road, like a perpetually anchored vessel with  its mainsail up; and he knows that the mountain is a gigantic frontier  beacon which marks the spot where Russia, Turkey, and Persia meet.    On December 13 I arrived at Teheran, having driven 800 miles in a month.  India was still 1500 miles off, and the route lies almost entirely  through deserts where only camels can travel. I therefore bought  fourteen fine camels, and took six Persians and a Tatar into my  service.    FOOTNOTES:    [4] A government servant or courier.

III    THROUGH THE CAUCASUS, PERSIA, AND MESOPOTAMIA (1885-6)      ST. PETERSBURG TO BAKU    On August 15, 1885, I went by steamer to St. Petersburg. There I entered  a train which ran south-eastwards through Moscow to Rostov, at the mouth  of the Don, and thence on to the Caucasus; and for four days I sat in my  compartment, letting my eyes rove over the immense steppes of Russia.  Hour after hour the train rolled along. A shrill whistle startles the  air when we come to a station, and equally sharply a bell rings once,  twice, and thrice when our line of carriages begins to move on again  over the flat country. In rapid course we fly past innumerable villages,  in which usually a whitewashed church lifts up its tower with a green  bulb-shaped roof. Homesteads and roads, rivers and brooks, fruitful  fields and haystacks, windmills with long revolving arms, carts and  wayfarers, all vanish behind us, and twilight and night four times  envelop huge Russia in darkness.    At last the mountains of the Caucasus appear in front of us, rising up  to the clouds like a light-blue wall. The whole range seems so light and  impalpable that we can scarcely believe that the very next day we shall  be driving up its valleys and over heights which are more than 16,000  feet above the sea-level. The distance is still great, but the white  summit of Mount Kazbek shines out amidst the blue.    At length we arrive at Vladikavkas, the end of the railway,[7] and begin  our journey of 130 miles over the mountains. My travelling companions  hired a carriage, and at every stage we had to change horses. I sat on  the box, and at the turns I had to hold on lest I should be thrown off  down into the abyss at the side of the road.    We constantly meet peasants with asses, or shepherds with flocks of  goats and sheep. Now comes a group of Caucasian horsemen in black  sheepskin coats and armed to the teeth; then the post-cart, packed full  of travellers; then again a load of hay drawn by oxen or grey buffaloes.    The higher we ascend, the grander and wilder the mountains become.  Sometimes the road is blasted out of perpendicular walls of rock, and  heavy masses of mountain hang like a vault above us. At dangerous  slopes, where the road is exposed to avalanches in spring, it runs  through tunnels of masonry. When an avalanche dashes furiously down the  mountain it leaps over these tunnels and continues down on the other  side without doing the road any harm.    We have now reached the highest point of the road, and after a journey  of twenty-eight hours we arrive at Tiflis, the largest town in Caucasia,  and one of the most curious towns I have seen. The houses hang like  clusters of swallows' nests on the slopes on both sides of the Kura  River, and the narrow, dirty streets are crowded with the fifteen  different tribes who dwell in Caucasia.    While the road leading to Tiflis over the mountains is grand, a more  dreary country can hardly be conceived than that crossed by the railway  between Tiflis and Baku: endless steppes and deserts, greyish-yellow and  desolate, with occasionally a caravan of slowly moving camels. A violent  storm arose as we drew near the sea. Dust rose up in clouds and  penetrated through all the chinks of the compartment, the air became  thick, heavy, and suffocating, and outside nothing could be seen but a  universal grey veil of impenetrable mist. But the worst was that the  storm struck the train on the side, and at last the engine was scarcely  able to draw the carriages along. Twice we had to stop, and on an ascent  the train even rolled back a little.    However, in spite of all, we at last reached the shore of the Caspian  Sea, where clear green billows rose as high as a house and thundered on  the strand. At seven o'clock in the evening we were at Baku, and drove  ten miles to Balakhani, where I remained seven months.    I remember that time as if it were yesterday. I struggled hopelessly  with the Russian grammar, but made great progress in Persian, and  learned to talk the Tatar language without the least difficulty.  Meanwhile I indulged in plans for a great journey to Persia. How it was  to be managed I did not know, for my means were not large. But I made up  my mind that through Persia I would travel, even if I went as a hired  servant and drove other people's asses along the roads.    The whole country round Baku is impregnated with petroleum, which  collects in vast quantities in cavities in the earth. To reach the oil a  tower of wood 50 to 65 feet high is erected, and a line with a powerful  borer runs over a block at the top. A steam-engine keeps the line in  constant motion, perpendicularly up and down, and the borer eats deeper  and deeper into the earth. The first section of piping which is forced  down into the bore-hole is about 40 inches in diameter. When this can go  no farther the boring is continued with a smaller borer, and a narrower  tube is thrust down within the first. And so the work is continued until  the petroleum level is reached and the valuable oil can be pumped up.    But it often happens that the oil is forced up through the pipe by the  pressure of gas in the bowels of the earth, and when I was at Balakhani  we often used to go out and look at this singular display. With a  deafening roar, a thick greenish-brown jet shot up out of the ground and  right through the derrick (Plate III.). It was visible from a long  distance, for it might be as much as 200 feet high, and the oil was  collected within dams thrown up around. If there was a strong wind the  jet would be dispersed, and a dark mist would lie like a veil over the  ground to leeward. In Balakhani one can hardly look out of the door  without one's clothes being smeared with oil, and the odour can be  perceived a dozen miles away. Not a blade of grass grows in this  neighbourhood; all that one sees is a forest of derricks. Lines of pipes  convey the oil from the borings to the \"Black Town\" of Baku, which is  full of oil refineries (over 170 in all) emitting vast volumes of smoke,  black and greasy buildings, and pools of oil refuse. When the crude  natural oil is purified, it is distributed far and wide in special  railway trucks like cisterns, and in special tank steamers, into which  the petroleum is pumped, and which carry nothing else.    In the Baku oil-fields there are now (1910) no fewer than 4094 bores, of  which 2600 are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#9)"],[1,"of that day was, that old Jehan Daas, with much laborious  effort, drew the sufferer homeward to his own little hut, which was a  stone's throw off amidst the fields; and there tended him with so much  care that the sickness, which had been a brain seizure brought on by  heat and thirst and exhaustion, with time and shade and rest passed  away, and health and strength returned, and Patrasche staggered up again  upon his four stout, tawny legs.    Now for many weeks he had been useless, powerless, sore, near to death;  but all this time he had heard no rough word, had felt no harsh touch,  but only the pitying murmurs of the child's voice and the soothing  caress of the old man's hand.    In his sickness they two had grown to care for him, this lonely man and  the little happy child. He had a corner of the hut, with a heap of  dry grass for his bed; and they had learned to listen eagerly for his  breathing in the dark night, to tell them that he lived; and when he  first was well enough to essay a loud, hollow, broken bay, they laughed  aloud, and almost wept together for joy at such a sign of his sure  restoration; and little Nello, in delighted glee, hung round his rugged  neck chains of marguerites, and kissed him with fresh and ruddy lips.    So then, when Patrasche arose, himself again, strong, big, gaunt,  powerful, his great wistful eyes had a gentle astonishment in them that  there were no curses to rouse him and no blows to drive him; and  his heart awakened to a mighty love, which never wavered once in its  fidelity while life abode with him.    But Patrasche, being a dog, was grateful. Patrasche lay pondering long  with grave, tender, musing brown eyes, watching the movements of his  friends.    Now, the old soldier, Jehan Daas, could do nothing for his living but  limp about a little with a small cart, with which he carried daily the  milk-cans of those happier neighbours who owned cattle away into the  town of Antwerp. The villagers gave him the employment a little out of  charity; more because it suited them well to send their milk into the  town by so honest a carrier, and bide at home themselves to look after  their gardens, their cows, their poultry, or their little fields. But it  was becoming hard work for the old man. He was eighty-three, and Antwerp  was a good league off, or more.    Patrasche watched the milk-cans come and go that one day when he had got  well and was lying in the sun with the wreath of marguerites round his  tawny neck.    The next morning, Patrasche, before the old man had touched the cart,  arose and walked to it and placed himself betwixt its handles, and  testified as plainly as dumb-show could do his desire and his ability  to work in return for the bread of charity that he had eaten. Jehan Daas  resisted long, for the old man was one of those who thought it a foul  shame to bind dogs to labor for which Nature never formed them. But  Patrasche would not be gainsaid; finding they did not harness him, he  tried to draw the cart onward with his teeth.    At length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished by the persistence and the  gratitude of this creature whom he had succored. He fashioned his cart  so that Patrasche could run in it, and this he did every morning of his  life thenceforward.    When the winter came, Jehan Daas thanked the blessed fortune that had  brought him to the dying dog in the ditch that fair-day of Louvain; for  he was very old, and he grew feebler with each year, and he would ill  have known how to pull his load of milk-cans over the snows and through  the deep ruts in the mud if it had not been for the strength and the  industry of the animal he had befriended. As for Patrasche, it seemed  heaven to him. After the frightful burdens that his old master had  compelled him to strain under, at the call of the whip at every step, it  seemed nothing to him but amusement to step out with this little light,  green cart, with its bright brass cans, by the side of the gentle old  man who always paid him with a tender caress and with a kindly word.  Besides, his work was over by three or four in the day, and after that  time he was free to do as he would--to stretch himself, to sleep in the  sun, to wander in the fields, to romp with the young child, or to play  with his fellow-dogs. Patrasche was very happy.    Fortunately for his peace, his former owner was killed in a drunken  brawl at the kermess of Mechlin, and so sought not after him nor  disturbed him in his new and well-loved home.    A few years later, old Jehan Daas, who had always been a cripple, became  so paralyzed with rheumatism that it was impossible for him to go out  with the cart any more. Then little Nello, being now grown to his sixth  year of age, and knowing the town well from having accompanied his  grandfather so many times, took his place beside the cart, and sold the  milk and received the coins in exchange, and brought them back to their  respective owners with a pretty grace and seriousness which charmed all  who beheld him.    The little Ardennois was a beautiful child, with dark, grave, tender  eyes, and a lovely bloom upon his face, and fair locks that clustered to  his throat; and many an artist sketched the group as it went by him--the  green cart with the brass flagons of Teniers and Mieris and Van Tal,  and the great, tawny-colored, massive dog, with his belled harness that  chimed cheerily as he went, and the small figure that ran beside him  which had little white feet in great wooden shoes, and a soft, grave,  innocent, happy face like the little fair children of Rubens.    Nello and Patrasche did the work so well and so joyfully together that  Jehan Daas himself, when the summer came and he was better again, had no  need to stir out, but could sit in the doorway in the sun and see them  go forth through the garden wicket, and then doze and dream and pray  a little, and then awake again as the clock tolled three and watch for  their return. And on their return Patrasche would shake himself free of  his harness with a bay of glee, and Nello would recount with pride the  doings of the day; and they would all go in together to their meal of  rye bread and milk or soup, and would see the shadows lengthen over the  great plain, and see the twilight veil the fair cathedral spire; and  then lie down together to sleep peacefully while the old man said a  prayer.    So the days and the years went on, and the lives of Nello and Patrasche  were happy, innocent, and healthful.    In the spring and summer especially were they glad. Flanders is not a  lovely land, and around the burg of Rubens it is perhaps least lovely  of all. Corn and colza, pasture and plough, succeed each other on the  characterless plain in wearying repetition, and, save by some gaunt gray  tower, with its peal of pathetic bells, or some figure coming athwart  the fields, made picturesque by a gleaner's bundle or a woodman's fagot,  there is no change, no variety, no beauty anywhere; and he who has  dwelt upon the mountains or amid the forests feels oppressed as by  imprisonment with the tedium and the endlessness of that vast and dreary  level. But it is green and very fertile, and it has wide horizons that  have a certain charm of their own even in their dulness and monotony;  and among the rushes by the waterside the flowers grow, and the trees  rise tall and fresh where the barges glide, with their great hulks black  against the sun, and their little green barrels and vari-coloured flags  gay against the leaves. Anyway, there is greenery and breadth of space  enough to be as good as beauty to a child and a dog; and these two asked  no better, when their work was done, than to lie buried in the lush  grasses on the side of the canal, and watch the cumbrous vessels  drifting by and bringing the crisp salt smell of the sea among the  blossoming scents of the country summer.    True, in the winter it was harder, and they had to rise in the darkness  and the bitter cold, and they had seldom as much as they could have  eaten any day; and the hut was scarce better than a shed when the nights  were cold, although it looked so pretty in warm weather, buried in a  great kindly clambering vine, that never bore fruit, indeed, but which  covered it with luxuriant green tracery all through the months of  blossom and harvest. In winter the winds found many holes in the walls  of the poor little hut, and the vine was black and leafless, and the  bare lands looked very bleak and drear without, and sometimes within the  floor was flooded and then frozen. In winter it was hard, and the snow  numbed the little white limbs of Nello, and the icicles cut the brave,  untiring feet of Patrasche.    But even then they were never heard to lament, either of them. The  child's wooden shoes and the dog's four legs would trot manfully  together over the frozen fields to the chime of the bells on the  harness; and then sometimes, in the streets of Antwerp, some housewife  would bring them a bowl of soup and a handful of bread, or some kindly  trader would throw some billets of fuel into the little cart as it went  homeward, or some woman in their own village would bid them keep a share  of the milk they carried for their own food; and they would run over  the white lands, through the early darkness, bright and happy, and burst  with a shout of joy into their home.    So, on the whole, it was well with them--very well; and Patrasche,  meeting on the highway or in the public streets the many dogs who toiled  from daybreak into nightfall, paid only with blows and curses, and  loosened from the shafts with a kick to starve and freeze as best they  might--Patrasche in his heart was very grateful to his fate, and thought  it the fairest and the kindliest the world could hold. Though he was  often very hungry indeed when he lay down at night; though he had to  work in the heats of summer noons and the rasping chills of winter  dawns; though"]]]
