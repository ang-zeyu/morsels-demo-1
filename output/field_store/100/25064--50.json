The  yellow stain is also got from an earth. All these coloured earths  are worked into a paste with water, or with animal fat, if they can  get it. I think they also get a red stain from the fruit of a species  of Pandanus; but I am not quite clear as to this. The black stain is  obtained from crushed vegetable ashes mixed with fat or water. The  staining of the face is usually of a simple character. It may cover  the whole face all in one colour or in different colours, and often  one side of the face is stained one colour, and the other side another  colour. They also make stripes and spots or either of them of any  colour or colours on any part of the face. The red colour (I think  especially that obtained from the Pandanus fruit) is also often applied  in staining the whole body, this being especially done for dances and  visiting; though a young dandy will often do it at other times. The  black is the symbol of mourning, and will be referred to hereafter.    Hairdressing may be conveniently dealt with here. The Mafulu  hairdressing is quite simple and rough, very different from the  big, spreading, elaborately prepared and carefully combed mops of  Mekeo. This is a factor which a traveller in this part of New Guinea  may well bear in mind in connection with his impedimenta, as he has  no difficulty in getting the Kuni and Mafulu people to carry packages  on their heads, which the Mekeo folk are unwilling to do.    The modes in which the men dress their hair, so far as I was able to  notice, may be roughly divided into the following categories:--(_a_)  A simple crop of hair either cut quite close or allowed to grow fairly  long, or anything between these two, but not dressed in any way,  and probably uncombed, unkempt and untidy. This is the commonest  form. (_b_) The same as (_a_), but with a band round the hair,  separating the upper part of it from the lower, and giving the former  a somewhat chignon-like appearance, (_c_) The hair done up all over  the head in three-stranded plaits a few inches long, and about an  eighth of an inch thick, having the appearance of short thick pieces  of string, (_d_) The top of the head undressed, but the sides, and  sometimes the back, of the head done up in plaits like (_c_). (_e_)  A manufactured long shaped fringe of hair, human, but not the hair  of the wearer (Plate 20, Fig. 3), is often worn over the forehead,  just under the wearer's own hair, so as to form, as it were, a part  of it, pieces of string being attached to the ends of the fringe  and passed round the back of the head, where they are tied. These  fringes are made by tying a series of little bunches of hair close  to one another along the double string, which forms the base of the  fringe. Specimens examined by me were about 12 inches long and 1 1/4  inches wide (this width being the length of the bunches of hair),  and contained about twenty bunches. It is usual to have two or three  of these strings of bunches of hair tied together at the ends, thus  making one broad fringe. These fringes are often worn in connection  with styles (_c_) and (_d_) of hairdressing; but I never noticed them  in association with (_a_) and (_b_).    I was told that men who have become bald sometimes wear complete  artificial wigs, though I never saw an example of this.    The hairdressing of the women seemed to be similar to that of the men,  except that I never saw the chignon-producing band, that they do not  wear fringes, and that the entire or partial plaiting of the hair is  more frequently adopted by them than it is by the men. I do not know  whether the women ever indulge in entire wigs.    Method (_a_) is seen in many of the plates. Method (_b_) is  illustrated, though not very well, in Plate 9 (the fourth and  fifth man from the left) and in Plate 21 (the young man to the  left, behind). Method (_c_) is adopted by four of the women in the  frontispiece, by some of the women in Plate 16, by the woman in Plate  17, and by the little girl in Plates 22 and 23. Method (_d_) is well  illustrated by the second woman from the right in the frontispiece.    The cutting of the hair of both men and women is effected with sharp  pieces of stone of the sort used for making adze blades, or with  sharp pieces of bamboo or shell.    Infant deformation is not practised in any form by the Mafulu people;  nor do they circumcise their children.      Ornaments.    The string-like plaits in which men and women arrange their  hair, and especially those of the women, are often decorated with  ornaments. Small cowrie and other shells, or native or European beads,  or both, are strung by women on to these plaits, sometimes in a line  along all or the greater part of the length of the plait, sometimes  as a pendant at the end of it, and sometimes in both ways; and any  other small ornamental object may be added. Dogs' teeth are also  used by both men and women in the same way; but these are, I think,  more commonly strung in line along the plaits, rather than suspended  at the ends of them. Both men and women wear suspended at the ends  of these plaits wild betel-nut fruit, looking like elongated acorns;  and men, but not women, wear in the same way small pieces of cane, an  inch or two long, into which the ends of the plaits are inserted. All  these forms of decoration may be found associated together. They are  in the case of men usually confined to the plaits at the sides, being  also often attached to the side ends of the artificial fringes; but  they are sometimes used for the back of the head also. The women often  wear them also at the top of the head, and in wearing them at the sides  sometimes have them hanging in long strings reaching to the shoulders.    Plate 24 (Figs. 1, 2, 5, and 6) and Plate 25 (Figs. 2 and 4) are  ornamented plaits cut off the heads of women. The ornaments shown  include beads, shells, discs made out of shells, dogs' teeth and  betel-nut fruit. Plate 24 (Figs. 3 and 4) are ornamented plaits cut  off the heads of men, one of them having a cane pendant, and the  other a pendant of betel-nut.    The appearance of these things, as worn, is seen in Plates 16, 26,  27, 28 and 29 (the habit of wearing a single dog-tooth at each side  of the head, as shown by 27, being a common one, and 28 showing  the equally common habit of wearing a couple of betel-nuts at each  side). Their appearance, when worn in abundance for a festal dance,  is excellently shown in the frontispiece and in Plate 17; and the  little girl in Plates 22 and 23, though too young to be a dancer,  is decorated for an occasion.    Pigs' tails are a common head decoration for women, and are also worn,  though not so frequently, by men. These tails are covered with the  natural hair of the tail, and are brown-coloured. They are suspended  by strings passing round the crown of the head or from the plaits at  the sides of the head. They are generally only about 6 inches long;  but sometimes the ornaments into which they are made are much longer,  and I have seen them worn by women hanging down as far as the level  of the breast. These pigtails are sometimes worn hanging in clusters  of several tails. They are also often, in the case of women, decorated  with shells, beads, dogs' teeth, etc., which are attached like tassels  to their upper ends. [44]    Plate 30, Fig. 3 shows a pigtail ornament for hanging over the head,  with the tails suspended on both sides and strings of beads and dogs'  teeth hanging from the upper ends of the tails. The ornament is worn  by the middle man in Plate 9 and by the little girl figured in Plates  22 and 23, and it is seen more extensively worn by women decorated  for dancing in the frontispiece and in Plate 17, and by the girl in  Plate 71.    A peculiar and less usual sort of head ornament (Plate 30, Fig. 4),  worn by both men and women, is a cluster of about a dozen or less of  bark cloth strings, about 1 1/2 feet long, fastened together at the  top, and there suspended by a string tied round the top of the head,  so as to hang down like the lashes of a several-thonged whip over the  back. The individual strings of the cluster are quite thin, but they  are decorated with the yellow and brown straw-like material above  referred to in connection with abdominal belt No. 6 (being prepared  from the same plant, apparently Dendrobium, and in the same way),  the material being twisted in a close spiral round the strings, and  making them look, when seen from a short distance off, like strings  of very small yellow and brown beads, irregularly arranged in varying  lengths of the two colours, shading off gradually from one to the  other. Even when so bound round, these strings are only about 1/16  to 1/8 of an inch thick.    The Mafulu comb (Plate 30, Fig. 2) differs in construction from  the wooden combs, all made in one piece, which are commonly used in  Mekeo. It is made of four, five, or six thin pieces of wood, which are  left blunt at one end, but are sharpened to points at the other. These  are bound together with straw-like work, sometimes beautifully done,  the binding being nearly always near to the blunt ends, though it  is sometimes almost in the middle. [45] The combs so made are flat,  with the blunt ends converging and generally fastened together, and  the long sharp ends, which are the ends to be inserted into the hair,  spreading outwards. The bound-up blunt ends are in fact a point, or,  say, half an inch or less (occasionally more) across. The spread of  the sharp ends varies from 1 to 2 inches or more. The straw-like  binding may be light or dark brown, or partly one and partly the  other. Sometimes only the two outside prongs meet together at the blunt  end, and the inner prongs do not extend much, or at all, beyond the  upper edge of the straw-like work binding. The fastening together of  the blunt converging tips is done sometimes with native"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#9)"],[1,"eckert's masterly renderings from Sanskrit literature he referred  slightingly as \"Sanskritpoesiemetriknachahmungen\" (ii. 235). But when he  hailed the younger poet as        Aller morgenlaend'schen Zaeune Koenig,      Wechselsweise zeisigkranichtoenig! (ii. 218),    he came much nearer to the truth than he imagined at the time. For,  while it will be conceded that Rueckert did not always sing with equal  power, it also is indisputable that he is the leading spirit in the  movement under investigation. But we shall not anticipate a discussion  of this poet's work, which is reserved for a succeeding chapter.      FOOTNOTES:    [125] See Benfey, Gesch. der Sprachwissenschaft und orient.

CHAPTER VII.    PLATEN.          His Oriental Studies--Ghaselen--Their Persian        Character--Imitation of Persian Form--Translations.      The first to introduce the _gazal_ in its strict form into German  literature[132] was Rueckert, who in 1821 published a version of a number  of _gazals_ from the _divan_ of Rumi.[133] Chronologically, therefore,  he ought to have the precedence in this investigation. If we,  nevertheless, take up Platen first, we do so because the _gazals_ of  this poet were really the first professedly original poems of this form  to appear in Germany (Rueckert's claiming to be versions only), and also  because they constitute almost the only portion of his poetic work that  comes within the sphere of this discussion. Moreover, the remarks which  we shall make concerning their content, imagery, and poetic structure,  apply largely to the _gazals_ of Rueckert and also to his _Oestliche  Rosen_, if we except the structure of the latter.    Platen became interested in the East through the work of Hammer, and  still more through the influence of Goethe's _Divan_. He at once set to  work studying Persian, and his zeal was increased when, on meeting  Rueckert in 1820 at Ebern, and again at Nuernberg, he received  encouragement and instruction from that scholarly poet. Above all, the  appearance of the latter's versions from Rumi gave him a powerful  stimulus, and in 1821 the first series of his _Ghaselen_ appeared at  Erlangen. Others followed in rapid succession. The same year a second  series appeared at Leipzig;[134] a third series, united under the title  _Spiegel des Hafis_, appeared at Erlangen the next year;[135] and,  lastly, a series called _Neue Ghaselen_ appeared in the same place in  1823. A few _gazals_ arose later, some being published as late as 1836  and 1839.[136]    We shall confine our discussion to those _gazals_ that date from the  years 1821 and 1822, the last series being Persian in nothing but form.    The _Ghaselen_ are not at all translations. Like the _Divan_-poems they  are original creations, inspired by the reading of Hafid, and, to use  the poet's own words \"dem Hafis nachgefuehlt und nachgedichtet.\"[137]  They follow as closely as possible the Persian metrical rules, and make  use throughout of Persian images and metaphors, so much so that we can  adduce direct parallels from the poems of Hafid. Thus in 13[138] we  read: \"Schenke! Tulpen sind wie Kelche Weines,\" evidently a parallel to  some such line as H. 541. 1:         [Arabic]    \"_saqi_, come! for the tulip-like goblet is filled with wine.\" In 75 the  words \"Weil ihren goldnen Busen doch vor euch verschliesst die Rose\" are  an echo of H. 300. 2:         [Arabic]    \"like the rose-bud, how can its inward secret remain concealed?\" (cf.  also H. 23. 3). And again in 85 \"Und nun ... entrinnet dem Herzen das  Blut leicht, das sonst mir den Odem benahm\" is to be compared with H.  11. 9:         [Arabic]    \"the sorrowful heart of Hafid, which through separation from thee is  full of blood.\" Furthermore in 81 we read:        Du fingst im lieblichen Trugnetz der Haare die ganze Welt,--      Als spiegelhaltende Sklavin gewahre die ganze Welt!    For the first line compare H. 102. 1:         [Arabic]    \"there is no one who has not been snared by that doubled tress,\" and for  the second line compare H. 470. 1:         [Arabic]    \"O, thou of whose beauty the sun is the mirror-holder!\" In 86 the idea  of the young men slain like game by the beauty of the beloved is  evidently inspired by H. 358. 6:         [Arabic]       [Arabic]    \"in every nook thine eye has a hundred slain ones fallen like me,\" and  the following lines in the same poem 86:        O welche Pfeile strahlt zu mir dein Antlitz,      Und es befreit kein Schild von deiner Schoenheit,    remind us of H. 561. 7:         [Arabic]         \"thine eye causes the arrow (lit. poplar) to pass through the       shield of life.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Again and again we meet with allusions to the famous image of the love  of the nightingale for the rose (35, 75, etc.) so common in Persian  poetry, especially in Hafid. We cite only 318. 1:         [Arabic]    \"the whole thought of the nightingale is that the rose may be his  beloved; the rose has in her thought how she may show grace in her  actions.\" In 302. 1 the nightingale is called [Arabic] \"the rose's  bride.\"    Besides this, the poems teem with characteristic Persian metaphors: the  moth longing for the flame (37, H. 187. 7); the tulip-bed glowing like  fire (67, H. 288. 1); the tulip-cheek [Arabic] (whence Moore's _Lalla  Rookh_), | (70, H. 155. 2); the musk-perfumed hair |  (73, H. 33. 4); the garden of the face (73, H. 33. 4); the pearl of  Aden | (77, H. 197. 10 and 651); wine as a ruby in a golden cup  (82, H. 204. 8 | \"O thou, the golden cup is  made full of ruby\"); the eye-brows like the crescent-moon (82, H. 470.  5 | \"brow like the new moon\"); the dust on his love's  threshold (83, H. 497. 10 |); the sky playing ball with the  moon (14, inspired by some such couplet as H. 409. 7); and the verses  like pearls (43). For this compare H. 499. 11:         [Arabic]    \"like a string of lustrous pearls is thy clear verse, O Hafid.\" We  might multiply such parallels, but those given bear out our statement in  regard to the imitation of Persian rhetorical figures on the part of  Platen.    In the eagerness to be genuinely Persian, the poet was not content,  however, with imitating only what was striking or beautiful; he  introduces even some features which, though very prominent in Eastern  poetry, will never become congenial to the West. Thus the utter  abjectness of the Oriental lover, who puts his face in the path of his  beloved and invites her (or him) to scatter dust on his head (H. 148.  3), is presented to us with all possible extravagance in these lines of  87:        Sieh mich hier im Staub und setze deine Ferse mir auf's Haupt,      Mich, den letzten von den letzten deiner letzten Sklaven, sieh![139]    To the _saqi_ is assigned a part almost as prominent as that which is  his in the Persian original. It was the introduction of this repulsive  trait (e.g. 82) that gave to Heine the opportunity for the savage,  scathing onslaught on Platen in the well known passage of the  _Reisebilder_.[140]           *       *       *       *       *    Otherwise Platen, like Goethe, ignores the mystic side of Hafid, and  infuses into his _Ghaselen_ a thoroughly bacchanalian spirit, taking  frequent occasion to declaim against hypocrisy, fanaticism and the  precepts of the _Quran_. The _credo_ of these poems is the opening  _gazal_ in _Spiegel des Hafis_ (64), where the line \"Wir schwoeren ew'gen  Leichtsinn und ew'ge Trunkenheit\" may be taken to reflect the sentiment  of the revelling Persian poet, who begs the _sufi_ not to forbid wine,  since from eternity it has been mingled with men's dust (H. 61. 4);  who claims to have been predestined to the tavern (H. 20. 4); who asks  indulgence if he turns aside from the mosque to the wine-house (H. 213.  4); who drinks his wine to the sound of the harp, feeling sure that God  will forgive him (H. 292. 5); who is above the reproach of the boasters  of austerity (H. 106. 3); and who, finally, asks that the cup be placed  in his coffin so that he may drink from it on the day of resurrection  (H. 308. 8). But when Platen flings away the _Quran_ he certainly is  not in accord with his Persian model, for, while Hafid takes issue with  the expounders of the sacred book, he discreetly refrains from assailing  the book itself.    But perhaps the chief significance of these _Ghaselen_, as well as those  of Rueckert, lies in the fact that they introduced a new poetic form into  German literature. It is astonishing to see how completely Platen has  mastered this difficult form. The _radif_ or refrain, so familiar to  readers of Hafid, he reproduces with complete success, as may be seen,  for instance, in 8, where the words \"du liebst mich nicht\" are repeated  at the end of each couplet, preceded successively by _zerrissen_,  _wissen_, _beflissen_, _gewissen_, _vermissen_, _Narzissen_, exactly in  the style of such an ode as H. 100. In those odes called _Spiegel des  Hafis_ the name _Hafis_ is even regularly introduced into the last  couplet, in accordance with the invariable rule of the Persian _gazal_  that the author's name must appear in the final couplet.    Besides the _gazal_ Platen has also attempted the _ruba'i_ or quatrain,  in which form he wrote twelve poems (_Werke_, ii. pp."]]]
