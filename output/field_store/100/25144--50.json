He obeyed.    It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone  a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with  living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which  bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,  and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been  scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as  that dull petrifaction of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or  Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the  floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,  brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,  mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,  cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense  twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim  with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a  jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not  unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on  Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.    \"Come in!\" exclaimed the Ghost. \"Come in! and know me better, man!\"    Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was  not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and, though the Spirit's eyes were  clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.    \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" said the Spirit. \"Look upon me!\"    Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,  or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the  figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be  warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the  ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no  other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining  icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial  face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its  unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was  an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was  eaten up with rust.    \"You have never seen the like of me before!\" exclaimed the Spirit.    \"Never,\" Scrooge made answer to it.    \"Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning  (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?\"  pursued the Phantom.    \"I don't think I have,\" said Scrooge. \"I am afraid I have not. Have you  had many brothers, Spirit?\"    \"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.    \"A tremendous family to provide for,\" muttered Scrooge.    The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.    \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where you will. I went  forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working  now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.\"    \"Touch my robe!\"    Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.    Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,  brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,  all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the  hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,  where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk  and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement  in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence  it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the  road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.    The house-fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,  contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with  the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed  up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows  that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great  streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace, in the  thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest  streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen,  whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all  the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were  blazing away to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very  cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of  cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer  sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.    For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial  and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now  and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far  than many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right, and not less  heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open,  and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great,  round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of  jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the  street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced,  broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth  like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at  the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up  mistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming  pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers'  benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might  water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and  brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and  pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were  Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the  oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy  persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper  bags, and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth  among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and  stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going  on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in  slow and passionless excitement.    The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters  down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone  that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that  the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters  were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended  scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the  raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the  sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious,  the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the  coldest lookers-on feel faint, and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that  the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in  modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything  was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all  so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they  tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets  wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back  to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best  humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and  fresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons  behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection,  and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.    But soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and  away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and  with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged, from scores  of by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,  carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor  revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with  Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and, taking off the covers as  their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.  And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice, when there  were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each  other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their  good-humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to  quarrel upon Christmas-day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!    In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was  a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners, and the progress of their  cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven; where the  pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.    \"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?\"  asked Scrooge.    \"There is. My own.\"    \"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\" asked Scrooge.    \"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"    \"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.    \"Because it needs it most.\"    \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge after a moment's thought. \"I wonder you, of all  the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these  people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment.\"    \"I!\" cried the Spirit.    \"You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day,  often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,\" said  Scrooge; \"wouldn't you?\"    \"I!\" cried the Spirit.    \"You seek to close these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#9)"],[1,"e\" after, not _with_, the cadence-measure.  And this is  the way the passage was meant to sound by its author, and the way it  will and must sound to the student who has properly cultivated his  sense of cadence.    [Illustration: Example 28.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    This case is extremely misleading; it is hard to believe (and feel)  that the characteristic onset of the 16th-triplet figure does not  herald the new phrase; but all the indications of strict, unswerving  analysis (not to be duped by appearances) point to the fact that this  is one of the common cases of disguised cadence, and not an elision of  the cadence.  The _sforzando_ marks of Beethoven confirm this view,  and, as in Example 27, we have our four measures to the next cadence,  without this \"cadence-measure.\"    The characteristic traits of all these various phases of cadence  formation are:--    (1) That the actual cadence-tone in the melody may be of any  time-value, from the full extent of the cadence-measure down to the  smallest fraction of that measure.  In Ex. 19 it was the former,  unbroken; in Ex. 17, No. 1, also, but broken into the six pulses of the  measure; in Ex. 20 it was shortened, by a rest, to one-half its real  value; in Ex. 26 it was reduced to one-quarter of its true value; in  Ex. 25, to one 8th-note; and in Ex. 24, No. 3, to one 16th-note.    (2) That the cadence-tone in the melody may be shifted forward to  almost any point beyond its expected position upon the primary accent.  In Ex. 20 (and many other of the given illustrations) it stands in its  legitimate place, at the beginning of the measure; in Ex. 21 it stands  upon the _second_ accent of the measure; in Ex. 22, No. 1, on the  second beat in 3-4 measure; in Ex. 22, No. 5, on the third beat of the  triple-measure; in Ex. 22, No. 4, on the last eighth note in the  measure.    (3) That in almost every case the effect of absolute cessation is  softened by marking the rhythm of the cadence-measure; in no case is  the rhythm permitted to pause (not even in Ex. 19, where the  accompaniment, not shown, is carried along in unbroken 8th-notes).   In  some part or other, by some means or other, the cadence-measure is kept  alive; either by continuing the accompaniment, as in Exs. 18 and 20, or  by quickly picking up a new rhythm, as in Exs. 27 and 28.  Conspicuous  exceptions to this rule will be found, it is true, in hymn-tunes and  the like; though occasionally even there, as the student may recall,  the rhythm, in some cadence-measures, is carried along by one or more  of the inner voices; for example, in the hymn-tune \"Lead, Kindly  Light,\" of J. B. Dykes.  (See also Ex. 29.)      SPECIES OF CADENCE.--In text-books and musical dictionaries several  varieties of the cadence are distinguished, but they are chiefly  distinctions without any more than one essential point of difference,  namely, difference in force or weight.  It is therefore feasible to  reduce all these varieties to two,--the heavy cadence and the light  cadence.  The former is represented by the so-called Perfect cadence,  the latter by the many grades of Semicadence.      PERFECT CADENCE.--There is one method of checking the current of the  melodic phrase with such emphasis and determination as to convey the  impression of finality; either absolute finality, as we observe it at  the very end of a composition, or such relative finality as is  necessary for the completion of some independent section of the  piece,--conclusive as far as that section is concerned, though not  precluding the addition of other sections to this, after the desired  degree of repose has been felt.  This is known as the perfect cadence,  or full stop.  It is always made upon the _tonic harmony_ of some key  as cadence-chord, with the _keynote itself in both outer parts_,  and--when desired in its strongest form (without such disguising as we  have seen)--upon an _accented_ beat, and of somewhat longer duration  than its fellow tones.  For illustration:--    [Illustration: Example 29.  Fragment of Schubert.]    At the end of this four-measure phrase there is a perfect cadence,  exhibited in its strongest, most conclusive form.  It is practically  undisguised, though the cadence-chord is reduced to three beats (from  the four to which it is entitled) to make room for the preliminary beat  of the next phrase (calculated to correspond to the one at the  beginning of this phrase).    The cadence-chord is the tonic harmony of C minor; upon the primary  accent of the 4th measure; it is considerably longer than any other  tone in the phrase; and the keynote _c_ is placed both at the top and  at the bottom of the harmonic body.  See also Ex. 15; the cadence is  perfect, because the cadence-chord, on the accent of the 4th measure,  is the tonic harmony of G major, with the keynote as highest and as  lowest tone.  It is abbreviated by rests, which very slightly diminish  its weight.  Ex. 17, No. 2, closes with a perfect cadence; it is the  tonic harmony of C major, on an accent, and with the keynote in the two  extreme parts.  See also Ex. 20.    In the following:    [Illustration: Example 30.  Fragment of Schumann.]    the cadence-chord stands upon the secondary accent (3d beat) of the  final measure.  This method of shifting the cadence forward is  generally adopted in large species of measure (6-8, 9-8, and the like),  and has been defined among the devices employed in disguising or  _lightening_ the cadence.  In Ex. 22, No. 5, the cadence-chord is  shifted to the last beat (unaccented) of the final measure; this  lightens the cadence very materially, but it does not affect any of its  essential properties as perfect cadence.  The following is similar:--    [Illustration: Example 31.  Fragment of Schumann.]      The cadence-chord occupies the unaccented (2d) beat, and is no longer  than any other chord in the phrase.  Despite its striking brevity, it  is nevertheless a perfect cadence, disguised; it is the tonic chord of  C major, with the keynote at top and bottom.  See also Ex. 23, No. 1.    The following illustrations come under the head of the disguised  cadences seen in Ex. 24:--    [Illustration: Example 32.  Fragments of Mendelssohn and Schubert.]    In No. 1 the cadence is perfect, for it is the tonic chord of G major,  keynote _g_ at top and bottom, and on the primary accent of the fourth  measure; but the uninterrupted continuation of the movement of 16ths,  in the right hand, shortens the uppermost keynote to a single  16th-note, and would entirely conceal the cadence, were it not for the  distinct evidence of repose in the lower part.    In No. 2 the movement in the upper part appears to shatter the cadence;  the keynote does not appear on the accent, and its announcement at the  end of the first triplet is very brief.  For all that, it is an  unmistakable perfect cadence; the chord thus shattered (or \"broken,\"  technically speaking) is the tonic harmony of the key, and the keynote  _does_ appear as uppermost (and therefore most prominent) tone, in the  same order of percussion as that given to each of the preceding melody  tones.          *      *      *      *      *      *    At the end of an entire piece of music, or of some larger section of  the piece, the cadence-chord, on the other hand, is often lengthened  considerably, for the sake of the greater weight and decision of  cadential interruption required at that place.  Thus:--    [Illustration: Example 33.  Fragment of Schubert.]      The last two measures are merely the prolongation of the final  cadence-chord.  See also, Mendelssohn, Songs Without Words, No. 4, last  five measures; No. 8, last eight measures; and others.    Another peculiarity of the final cadence is, that sometimes the  _uppermost_ tone is the 3d or 5th of the tonic chord, instead of the  keynote,--a significant device to counteract the dead weight of the  cadence-chord, especially when prolonged as just seen.  See No. 10 of  the Songs Without Words, last six measures; it is the tonic chord of B  minor, but the tone _d_ (the 3d) is placed at the top, instead of _b_.  Also No. 16, last chord; No. 38, last chord; No. 6, last three measures  (the 5th of the tonic chord as uppermost tone).  At any other point in  the piece this default of the keynote would, as we shall presently see,  almost certainly reduce the weight of the cadence from \"perfect\" to  \"semicadence\"; at the very end, however, it cannot mislead, because it  does not affect the condition of actual finality.      SEMICADENCE.--Any deviation from the formula of the perfect  cadence--either in the choice of some other than the tonic chord, or in  the omission of the keynote in either (or both) of the outer  parts--weakens the force of the interruption, and transforms the  cadence into a lighter, more transient, point of repose, for which the  term semicadence (or half-stop) is used.  The semicadence indicates  plainly enough the end of its phrase, but does not completely sever it  from that which follows.    It is these lighter, transient forms of cadence to which a number of  different names are given; for the student of analysis (and the  composer, also, for that matter) the one general term \"semicadence,\" or  half-cadence, is sufficient, and we shall use no other.    If, then, a cadence is final in its effect, it is a perfect one; if  not, it is a semicadence.  The harmony most commonly chosen as the  resting-place of a semicadence is the chord of the _dominant_,--the  fifth step of the momentary key,--that being the harmony next in  importance to that of the tonic (the one invariably used for the  perfect cadence).  The following example illustrates the dominant  semicadence:--    [Illustration: Example 34.  Fragment of Brahms.]      The cadence-chord is the dominant harmony (root _e_) in the key of A  minor; neither of the two upper tones on the first and second beats is  the root of the chord; it is quite sufficient that the"]]]
