You were but  a nymph when last my eyes had beheld you, and now you are matured into a  goddess.\"    The duke then made some slight allusion to the family of madame Lagarde,  but guessing with his admirable tact, that such reminiscences could not  be particularly agreeable to me, he dexterously turned the conversation,  by requesting permission to present to me his nephew, the duc  d'Aiguillon, that he might leave a worthy substitute and champion near  the king when state affairs called him into Gascony; he craved my kind  offices to obtain the intimate acquaintance of comte Jean. They  were subsequently at daggers drawn with each other, but this haughty  overbearing lord conducted himself at first with the most abject  servility. The third favor he had to solicit was that I would name him  to the king as frequently as opportunities occurred to form one of our  supper parties. All this I engaged to do, nor indeed could I refuse  after the violent protestations of friendship he made me.    \"You will, ere long,\" said he, \"see the whole court at your feet, but  beware of considering them all as your friends; have a care, above all,  of the duchesse de Grammont. She has been long endeavoring to obtain the  king's affections, and she will see with hatred and fury another more  worthy engrossing the place she has so vainly contended for; she and  her impertinent brother will call in the aid of the devil himself to  dispossess you of your elevated seat; you are lost if you do not twist  both their necks.\"    \"How, monsieur le marechal, shall I mark my career by a murder?\"    \"You take me too literally; I only mean that in your place I would not  be at the trouble of keeping any terms with them.\"    \"Ah, monsieur le duc, I understand you now; yet it seems a bad augury to  have to begin my reign by cabals and intrigues.\"    \"Alas! my fair comtesse, you are too good, too guileless for a court  life; between ourselves we are all hypocrites more or less; mistrust  every one, even those make the finest protestations.\"    \"In that case the first object of my suspicion would be my old and  esteemed friend the marechal de Richelieu.\"    \"Ah, madame! this is not fair usage, thus to turn my weapons against  myself, and to fight me with my own arms.\"    Upon this the duke quitted me, and scarcely had he left the room, when  the duc la Vauguyon entered. This gentleman offered me no advice; he  contented himself by styling the Jesuits his \"very good friends,\" and  continually turning the conversation upon their merits. I allowed him  to express his attachment, without interruption, for these disagreeable  men, whom I determined in my own mind to have nothing to do with,  recollecting all I had heard of their dislike to our sex. After an hour  passed in amusing talk, the duc de la Vauguyon retired, well pleased  with his visit, and his place was immediately supplied by comte Jean,  to whom I communicated all that had passed between my late visitors and  myself.    \"For heaven's sake,\" said he, \"let us not be the dupes of these great  lords; before we range ourselves under the banners of either of them let  us secure our own footing; let us wait till you are presented.\"    \"But, my good friend, I must be a married lady to obtain that honor.\"    \"And so you will be shortly, do not be uneasy about that. I have written  to my brother William to set out without delay for Paris. Your swain  will be easily induced to marry you. What do you think of that?\"    I gave comte Jean to comprehend, by signs, that I left my destiny in his  hands, and he kissed my hands and withdrew. The king managed to steal a  few minutes to converse with me.    \"You did not intrust me, my sweet friend,\" said he, \"with the  circumstance of your having formerly known the duc de Richelieu; less  reserved on the subject than you were, he told me he had seen you at the  house of madame Lagarde, who considered you one of her dearest friends.\"    \"Sire,\" replied I, \"I was too much occupied with your majesty, to think  of any other person in the world.\"    My answer delighted him, he looked at me in the most gracious manner.    \"You would almost persuade me that you love me,\" said he, smiling.    \"Indeed, your majesty,\" said I, \"I only pray that you desire the  continuance of my affection.\"    \"In that case,\" replied he, kissing my hand with fervor, \"you do but  partake of my tenderness for you.\"    These words flattered my vanity, and here I must declare that if I never  felt for the king that violent attachment which is termed love, I ever  entertained for him the warmest esteem. He was so attentive, so kind to  me, that I must have been a monster of ingratitude could I have looked  upon him with indifference.    Our supper on this night was again lively as the first had been. The  duc de Richelieu entertained us with several amusing anecdotes; not that  they contained any thing very piquant, but the duke related them well,  and we were all in the humor to be pleased, and laughed heartily at  what he said. Comte Jean, whose eye constantly followed me, appeared  perfectly satisfied with all I said or did. As for the king, he seemed  enchanted with me, and seemed wholly occupied in watching my looks, that  he might anticipate my wants. After supper, in the _tete-a-tete_  which followed, he explained himself in terms which left me no doubt how  securely my empire over him was established. Had he been less explicit  on the subject, the flattering marks of favor, and the adulatory  compliments I received from all on the following day, would well have  assured me of it. I was no longer an obscure and friendless individual,  but the beloved mistress of the king; I was, to use the expression of  Lebel, a new sun which had arisen to illumine horizon of Versailles.  I could no longer doubt my power when I saw noble personages present  themselves to solicit the most servile employments about my person.  Amongst others, I might instance a certain lady de St. Benoit, who  continued first lady of my chamber, during the whole time of my  regency;--my justly-valued Henriette being contented to take the second  place of honor.

He was not young, but handsome and  well made, with much amiability and great courage. A sincere friend, no  consideration could weaken his regard; an adversary to be dreaded, no  obstacle could repress his boldness. His enemies--and amongst them  he included the whole magistracy--his enemies, I say, have used him  shamefully, but he treated them too ill for them to be believed in  any thing they say of him. If he were ambitious, he had the excuse of  superior merit, and if he showed himself too severe in one particular,  it proceeded from an energy of mind which did not allow him to have more  pity for others than they had for him. Do not, my friend, think that the  attachment I had for him can transport me beyond just limits. Since he  is in his grave, my illusions, if I had any, have dissipated. I only  give to my deceased friends the tribute due to them--truth and tears.  But really, without thinking of it, I am attributing to myself these  virtues without necessity, forgetting that you are not one of those who  would fain render me as black as possible in the eyes of posterity.    In proportion as the first sight of the uncle had prejudiced me against  him, so much more did it propitiate me towards the nephew. I saw in him  a generous heart, and a genius capable of lofty actions which you would  vainly have sought for in the marechal de Richelieu. No doubt at the  beginning of our _liaison_ the duc d'Aiguillon only saw in me a woman  who could be useful to his projects and plans; but soon his heart joined  the alliance, and a devotion of calculation was succeeded by a vehement  passion, of which I was justly proud, as it subdued to my chains the  most accomplished of courtiers.    Our first interview was lively. The marechal and he supported the  conversation with much gaiety. M. de Richelieu, as I have already told  you, had neither wit nor information, but possessed that ease of the  first circles, those manners of high breeding, those courtly graces,  which often surpass wit and information.    \"My nephew,\" said he to the duke, \"madame can do much for us, but we  must first do something for her. Without support, without friends, she  will be lost at Versailles; let us be her partisans if she will allow  it, and let her youth have the benefit of our experience.\"    The tone in which the duc d'Aiguillon replied delighted me. He said he  was but too happy to serve me, and begged me to rely on him as I would  on myself.    \"But,\" he continued, \"but we have to struggle with a powerful party. The  duchesse de Grammont and her brother are not the persons to give up the  field without striking a blow. But, madame, by the assistance of your  happy and lovely star, I will enter the lists with pleasure, and if a  glance of your eyes will recompense a conqueror, I shall be he.\"    \"Oh,\" exclaimed the duke, \"my nephew's a second Amadis in gallantry, and  of undaunted courage. You will be satisfied with him, madame, much more  than with my son, who only resembles the family in his defects.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#9)"],[1,"be changed into a  squirrel, to eat only of the service berries. When he had finished his  meal, the squirrels showed him how to make two kethÃ wns and how to bury  them.    52. Now Niltci whispered: \"Let us go to DsilyÃ -iÃ§Ã­n\" (Four Doorways  Under a Mountain), where dwells [Â¢]asÃ ni (the Porcupine). His house was  in a black mountain. At the eastern doorway there was a black spruce  tree for a door. On the other sides there were no doors; the entrances  were open. They found here four porcupine gods, two male and two female.  They were colored according to the four cardinal hues. The black one  stood in the east, the blue one in the south, the yellow one in the  west, and the white one in the north. They instructed him concerning the  kethÃ wns of the porcupines, and they offered him food, which consisted  of the inner bark of different kinds of trees. But again, prompted by  Niltci, he refused the food, saying that he was not able to eat food of  that kind. \"It is well,\" said the porcupines, \"and now you may leave  us.\"    53. \"Off in this direction,\" whispered Niltci, pointing to the  northeast, \"is a place called QoÂ¢estsÃ² (Where Yellow Streak Runs Down).  Let us go thither.\" Here they entered a house of one room, made of black  water. The door was of wind. It was the home of Tcal-ninÃ©z (Long-Frog),  of ÃoklÃ­c (Water Snake), of KlickÃ  (Arrow Snake), and of other serpents  and animals of the water. It was called AhyÃ¨qoÂ¢eÃ§i` (They Came  Together), because here the prophet of the dsilyÃ­dje qaÃ§Ã l visited the  home of the snakes and learned something of their mysteries. The  ceremonies sacred to these animals belong to another dance, that of the  qojÃ²ni-qaÃ§Ã l (chant of terrestrial beauty); but in the mysteries learned  in AhyÃ¨qoÂ¢eÃ§i` the two ceremonies are one. Here he was instructed how to  make and to sacrifice four kethÃ wns. To symbolize this visit of Dsilyi`  NeyÃ¡ni and this union of the two ceremonies, the first sand picture is  made. (See Plate XV.)    54. The next place they visited was AÃ§Ã nkikÃ¨, where there was a house  built of the white rock crystal, with a door made of all sorts of  plants. It was called TsegÃ Â¢iniÃ§ini-behogan (House of Rock Crystal) and  was the home of TcikÃ¨-Â¢igÃ¬ni (Supernatural Young Woman, or Young Woman  Goddess), who was the richest of all the Â¢igÃ¬ni. In the middle of the  floor stood a large crystal in the shape of a kethÃ wn. Just as they were  entering, QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i, who had disappeared from the Navajo's sight at the  house of the bears, here rejoined him, and the party now numbered five.  The apartment, when they came into it, was very small, but QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i  blew on the walls, which extended thereat until the room was one of  great size. The goddess showed the Navajo how to make two kethÃ wns and  directed him how to dispose of them.    55. Thence they journeyed to TsitsÃ¨-intyÃ¨li (Broad Cherry Trees), where,  in a house of cherries with a door of lightning, there lived four gods  named Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni (Reared Within the Mountains). The Navajo was  surprised to find that not only had they the same name as he had, but  that they looked just like him and had clothes exactly the same as his,  His companions said to him: \"These are the gods in whose beautiful form  the Butterfly goddess has molded you. These are the gods whose name you  bear.\" The hosts bade their visitors be seated, and they ranged  themselves around the fire, one at each of the cardinal points. Each  held an arrow made of the cliff rose (_Cowania mexicana_) in his  extended right hand. The head of the arrow was of stone, the fletching  of eagle feathers, and the \"breath feather\" of the downy plume of the  TsenÃ¡hale (the Harpy of Navajo mythology). As they held the arrows they  ejaculated, \"ai`, ai`, ai`, ai`,\" as they who dance the kÃ¡tso-yisÃ§Ã u do  in the ceremonies to this day, and after the fourth ai` each one  swallowed his arrow, head foremost, until the fletching touched his  lips. Then he withdrew the arrow and they said: \"Thus do we wish the  Navajo to do in the dance which you will teach them; but they must take  good care not to break off the arrowheads when they swallow and withdraw  them.\" Such is the origin of the dance of the kÃ¡tso-yisÃ§Ã n, or great  plumed arrow. As they bade him good-bye, one of them said to the Navajo:  \"We look for you,\" i.e., \"We expect you to return to us,\" an intimation  to him that when he left the earth he should return to the gods, to  dwell among them forever.    56. From this place they journeyed on until they reached AÃ§Ã dsil (Leaf  Mountain), and found the house that was made of dew-drops  ([Â¢]aÃ§Ã²-behogan) and that had a door made of plants of many different  kinds. This was the home of the BitsÃ¨s-ninÃ©z (Long Bodies), who were  goddesses. When they rose, as the strangers entered, the plumes on their  heads seemed to touch the heavens, they were so very tall. The goddesses  said to Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni, \"We give you no kethÃ wn, but look at us well and  remember how we appear, for in your ceremonies you must draw our  picture; yet draw us not, as we now stand, in the east, the south, the  west, and the north; but draw us as if we all stood in the east.\" This  is the origin of the second picture that is painted on the sand.  (Plate XVI.)    57. Leaving the House of Dew they proceeded to ÃonakÃ Ã¯ (White Water  Running Across). This was a stream which ran down the side of a hill and  had its source in a great spring. Immediately above this spring was the  home of QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i. The latter, as they approached his home, stopped at  the foot of the hill and four times ordered his companions to go in  advance; but four times they refused. After the last refusal QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i  clapped his hands, uttered his cry of \"hu`hu`hu`hu`!\" and led the way.  The house was of corn pollen; the door was of daylight; the ceiling was  supported by four white spruce trees; rainbows ran in every direction  and made the house shine within with their bright and beautiful colors.  Neither kethÃ wn nor ceremony was shown the Navajo here; but he was  allowed to tarry four nights and was fed with an abundance of white corn  meal and corn pollen.    58. Now QastcÃ¨Ã«lÃ§i took him to a place called LejpÃ¡hiÃ§o (Brown Earth  Water) and led him to the top of a high hill, from which they could see  in the far distance GÃ¡ngiÃ§o, where the prophet's family dwelt; for they  had moved away from the valley in [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, where he left them. Then  the yay showed him the shortest road to take and bade him return to his  people.    59. When he got within sight of his house his people made him stop and  told him not to approach nearer until they had summoned a Navajo shaman.  When the latter, whose name was Red Queue, came, ceremonies were  performed over the returned wanderer, and he was washed from head to  foot and dried with corn meal; for thus do the Navajo treat all who  return to their homes from captivity with another tribe, in order that  all alien substances and influences may be removed from them. When he  had been thus purified he entered the house and his people embraced him  and wept over him. But to him the odors of the lodge were now  intolerable and he soon left the house and sat outside. Seeing this, the  shaman gave it as his opinion that the purification already made was not  sufficient, and that it would be well to have a great dance over him. In  those days the Navajo had a healing dance in the dark corral; but it was  imperfect, with few songs and no kethÃ wns or sacrificial sticks. It was  not until Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni recounted his revelations that it became the  great dance it now is among the Navajo.    60. It was agreed that before the dance began Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni should be  allowed four days and four nights in which to tell his story and that  the medicine man should send out a number of young men to collect the  plants that were necessary for the coming ceremony. For four nights and  for four days he was busy in relating his adventures and instructing his  hearers in all the mysteries he had learned in the homes of the Â¢igÃ¬ni.  Then they built the medicine lodge and got all things ready for the new  rites and for the purification of the one who had returned. The shaman  selected from among the plants brought him by the young men such as he  thought would best cleanse his patient of all the strange food he had  taken among the alien Indians and in the houses of the supernatural ones  whom he had visited. On the first day he gave him pine and spruce; on  the second day, big and little willows; on the third day, a plant called  litci and the aromatic sumac; on the fourth day, cedar and piÃ±on. Of  these the prophet drank cold and hot infusions in the morning by the  fire.    61. During these four days the ceremonies which Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni had  introduced were in progress. On the fifth day it was proposed they  should send out the akÃ¡ninili (meal sprinkler) or courier to invite  their neighbors to the great dance. There were two couriers to be sent:  one was to go to the north, to a place called ÃÃ²gojilÃ¡` (Much Grease  Wood), to invite some friendly bands of Ute, some distant bands of  Navajo, and some Jicarilla who dwelt there; the other was to go to the  south, to Tse`lakÃ [-i]-silÃ  (Where Two White Rocks Lie), to ask the  Southern Apache, the White Mountain Apache, the Cohonino, and a tribe  called [Â¢]ildjÃ¨he, to attend. To the camp in the north it was a journey  of two days and two nights, and it would take the fleetest runner the  same time to return. To the home of their neighbors in the south it was  as far. As these long journeys must be made on foot and running, they  could not find a single young man in the camp who would volunteer for  the task. The men counseled about the difficulty all day and tried much  persuasion on the youths, but none were found willing to make either  journey.    62. As night approached an old "]]]
