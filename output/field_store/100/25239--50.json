[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE MAMMOTH CAVE.]      The extraordinary caverns which underlie various parts of this country  are of a description suitable in extent and magnificence to the general  scale of nature here, in lakes, rivers, cataracts, valleys in which  empires are cradled, prairies of scarcely conceivable vastness, and  mountains whose bases are amid perpetual flowers and where frozen seas  have never intermission of their crashing thunders. In Virginia,  New-York, and other states, the caves of Weyer, Schoharie, and many that  are less famous but not inferior in beauty or grandeur, are well known  to travellers; but the MAMMOTH CAVE, under Kentucky, is world renowned,  and such felon states as Naples might hide in it from the scorn of  mankind. Considering the common curiosity respecting that strange  subterranean country, and the fact of its being resorted to in winter by  valetudinarians, on account of its admirable climate--so that our  article is altogether seasonable--we give, chiefly from a letter by Mrs.  Child, a very full description of this eighth wonder of the  world--illustrated by engravings from recent drawings made under the  direction of the Rev. Horace Martin, who proposes soon to furnish for  tourists an ample volume on the subject.    The Mammoth Cave is in the southwest part of Kentucky, about a hundred  miles from Louisville, and sixty from Harrodsburg Springs. The word  _cave_ is ill calculated to impress the imagination with an idea of its  surpassing grandeur. It is in fact a subterranean world; containing  within itself territories extensive enough for half a score of German  principalities. It should be named Titans' Palace, or Cyclops' Grotto.  It lies among the Knobs, a range of hills, which border an extent of  country, like highland prairies, called the Barrens. The surrounding  scenery is lovely. Fine woods of oak, hickory, and chestnut, clear of  underbrush, with smooth, verdant openings, like the parks of English  noblemen.    [Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE.--VIEW TAKEN FROM THE INSIDE.]    The cave was purchased by Dr. John Croghan, for ten thousand dollars. To  prevent a disputed title, in case any new and distant opening should be  discovered, he has likewise bought a wide circuit of adjoining land. His  enthusiasm concerning it is unbounded. It is in fact his world; and  every newly-discovered chamber fills him with pride and joy, like that  felt by Columbus, when he first kissed his hand to the fair Queen of the  Antilles. He has built a commodious hotel[B] near the entrance, in a  style well suited to the place. It is made of logs, filled in with lime;  with a fine large porch, in front of which is a beautiful verdant lawn.  Near by, is a funnel-shaped hollow of three hundred acres; probably a  cave fallen in. It is called Deer Park, because when those animals run  into it, they cannot escape. There are troops of wild deer in the  immediate vicinity of the hotel; bear-hunts are frequent, and game of  all kinds abounds.    Walking along the verge of this hollow, you come to a ravine, leading to  Green River, whence you command a view of what is supposed to be the  main entrance to the cave. It is a huge cavernous arch, filled in with  immense stones, as if giants had piled them there, to imprison a  conquered demon. No opening has ever been effected here, nor is it easy  to imagine that it could be done by the strength of man. In rear of the  hotel is a deep ravine densely wooded, and covered with a luxuriant  vegetable growth. It leads to Green River, and was probably once a water  course. A narrow ravine, diverging from this, leads, by a winding path,  to the entrance of the cave. It is a high arch of rocks, rudely piled,  and richly covered with ivy and tangled vines. At the top, is a  perennial fountain of sweet and cool water, which trickles down  continually from the centre of the arch, through the pendent foliage,  and is caught in a vessel below. The entrance of this wide arch is  somewhat obstructed by a large mound of saltpetre, thrown up by workmen  engaged in its manufacture, during the last war. In the course of their  excavations, they dug up the bones of a gigantic man; but,  unfortunately, they buried them again, without any memorial to mark the  spot. They have been sought for by the curious and scientific, but are  not yet found.    As you come opposite the entrance of the cave, in summer, the  temperature changes instantaneously, from about 85 deg. to below 60 deg., and  you feel chilled as if by the presence of an iceberg. In winter, the  effect is reversed. The scientific have indulged in various speculations  concerning the air of this cave. It is supposed to get completely filled  with cold winds during the long blasts of winter, and as there is no  outlet, they remain pent up till the atmosphere without becomes warmer  than that within; when there is, of course, a continual effort toward  equilibrium. Why the air within the cave should be so fresh, pure, and  equable, all the year round, even in its deepest recesses, is not so  easily explained. Some have suggested that it is continually modified by  the presence of chemical agents. Whatever may be the cause, its  agreeable salubrity is observed by every visitor, and it is said to have  great healing power in diseases of the lungs. The amount of exertion  which can be performed here without fatigue, is astonishing. The  superabundance of oxygen in the atmosphere operates like moderate doses  of exhilarating gas. The traveller feels a buoyant sensation, which  tempts him to run and jump, and leap from crag to crag, and bound over  the stones in his path. The mind, moreover, sustains the body, being  kept in a state of delightful activity, by continual new discoveries and  startling revelations.    The wide entrance to the cavern soon contracts, so that but two can pass  abreast. At this place, called the Narrows, the air from dark depths  beyond blows out fiercely, as if the spirits of the cave had mustered  there, to drive intruders back to the realms of day. This path continues  about fourteen or fifteen rods, and emerges into a wider avenue, floored  with saltpetre earth, from which the stones have been removed. This  leads directly into the Rotunda, a vast hall, comprising a surface of  eight acres, arched with a dome a hundred feet high, without a single  pillar to support it. It rests on irregular ribs of dark gray rock, in  massive oval rings, smaller and smaller, one seen within another, till  they terminate at the top. Perhaps this apartment impresses the  traveller as much as any portion of the cave; because from it he  receives his first idea of its gigantic proportions. The vastness, the  gloom, the impossibility of taking in the boundaries by the light of  lamps--all these produce a deep sensation of awe and wonder.    From the Rotunda, you pass into Audubon's Avenue, from eighty to a  hundred feet high, with galleries of rock on each side, jutting out  farther and father, till they nearly meet at top. This avenue branches  out into a vast half-oval hall, called the Church. This contains several  projecting galleries, one of them resembling a cathedral choir. There is  a gap in the gallery, and at the point of interruption, immediately  above, is a rostrum, or pulpit, the rocky canopy of which juts over. The  guide leads up from the adjoining galleries, and places a lamp each side  of the pulpit, on flat rocks, which seem made for the purpose. There has  been preaching from this pulpit; but unless it was superior to most  theological teaching, it must have been pitifully discordant with the  sublimity of the place. Five thousand people could stand in this  subterranean temple with ease.    So far, all is irregular, jagged rocks, thrown together in fantastic  masses, without any particular style; but now begins a series of  imitations, which grow more and more perfect, in gradual progression,  till you arrive at the end. From the Church you pass into what is called  the Gothic Gallery, from its obvious resemblance to that style of  architecture. Here is Mummy Hall; so called because several mummies have  been found seated in recesses of the rock. Without any process of  embalming, they were in as perfect a state of preservation, as the  mummies of Egypt; for the air of the cave is so dry and unchangeable,  and so strongly impregnated with nitre, that decomposition cannot take  place. A mummy found here in 1813, was the body of a woman five feet ten  inches high, wrapped in half-dressed deer skins, on which were rudely  drawn white veins and leaves. At the feet, lay a pair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#9)"],[1,"scale a temple to the Olympian Zeus, which remained  unfinished for centuries, and was at length completed by the emperor  Hadrian.  He was a patron of literature, as well as of the arts.  He is  said to have been the first person in Greece who collected a library,  which he threw open to the public; and to him posterity is indebted for  the collection of the Homeric poems.  On the whole it cannot be denied  that he made a wise and noble use of his power.    Pisistratus died at an advanced age in 527 B.C., thirty-three years  after his first usurpation.  He transmitted the sovereign power to his  sons, Hippias and Hipparchus, who conducted the government on the same  principles as their father.  Hipparchus inherited his father's literary  tastes.  He invited several distinguished poets, such as Anacreon and  Simonides, to his court.  The people appear to have been contented with  their rule; and it was only an accidental circumstance which led to  their overthrow and to a change in the government.    Their fall was occasioned by the conspiracy of Harmodius and  Aristogiton, who were attached to each other by a most intimate  friendship.  Harmodius having given offence to Hippias, the despot  revenged himself by putting a public affront upon his sister.  This  indignity excited the resentment of the two friends, and they now  resolved to slay the despots at the festival of the Great Panathenaea,  when all the citizens were required to attend in arms.  Having  communicated their design to a few associates, the conspirators  appeared armed at the appointed time like the rest of the citizens, but  carrying concealed daggers besides.  Harmodius and Aristogiton had  planned to kill Hippias first as he was arranging the order of the  procession outside the city, but, upon approaching the spot where he  was standing, they were thunderstruck at beholding one of the  conspirators in close conversation with the despot.  Believing that  they were betrayed, they rushed back into the city with their daggers  hid in the myrtle boughs which they were to have carried in the  procession, and killed Hipparchus.  Harmodius was immediately cut down  by the guards.  Aristogiton died under the tortures to which he was  subjected in order to compel him to disclose his accomplices.    Hipparchus was assassinated in B.C. 514, the fourteenth year after the  death of Pisistratus.  From this time the character of the government  became entirely changed.  His brother's murder converted Hippias into a  cruel and suspicious tyrant.  He put to death numbers of the citizens,  and raised large sums of money by extraordinary taxes.    The Alcmaeonidae, who had lived in exile ever since the third and final  restoration of Pisistratus to Athens, now began to form schemes to  expel the tyrant.  Clisthenes, the son of Megacles, who was the head of  the family, secured the Delphian oracle by pecuniary presents to the  Pythia, or priestess, henceforth, whenever the Spartans came to consult  the oracle, the answer of the priestess was always the same, \"Athens  must be liberated.\" This order was so often repeated, that the Spartans  at last resolved to obey.  Cleomenes, king of Sparta, defeated the  Thessalian allies of Hippias; and the tyrant, unable to meet his  enemies in the field, took refuge in the Acropolis.  Here he might have  maintained himself in safety, had not his children been made prisoners  as they were being secretly carried out of the country.  To procure  their restoration, he consented to quit Attics in the space of five  days.  He sailed to Asia, and took up his residence at Sigeum in the  Troad, which his father had wrested from the Mytilenaeans in war.    Hippias was expelled in B.C. 510, four years after the assassination of  Hipparchus.  These four years had been a time of suffering and  oppression for the Athenians, and had effaced from their minds all  recollection of the former mild rule of Pisistratus and his sons.  Hence the expulsion of the family was hailed with delight.  The memory  of Harmodius and Aristogiton was cherished with the fondest reverence;  and the Athenians of a later age, overlooking the four years which had  elapsed from their death to the overthrow of the despotism, represented  them as the liberators of their country and the first martyrs for its  liberty.  Their statues were erected in the market-place soon after the  expulsion of Hippias; their descendants enjoyed immunity from all taxes  and public burdens; and their deed of vengeance formed the favourite  subject of drinking songs.    The Lacedaemonians quitted Athens soon after Hippias had sailed away,  leaving the Athenians to settle their own affairs. Clisthenes, to whom  Athens was mainly indebted for its liberation from the despotism,  aspired to be the political leader of the state but he was opposed by  Isagoras, the leader of the party of the nobles.  By the Solonian  constitution, the whole political power was vested in the hands of the  nobles; and Clisthenes soon found that it was hopeless to contend  against his rival under the existing order of things.  For this reason  he resolved to introduce an important change in the constitution, and  to give to the people an equal share in the government.    The reforms of Clisthenes gave birth to the Athenian democracy, which  can hardly be said to have existed before this time.  His first and  most important measure was a redistribution of the whole population of  Attica into ten new tribes.  He abolished the four ancient Ionic  tribes, and enrolled in the ten new tribes all the free inhabitants of  Attica, including both resident aliens and even emancipated slaves.  He  divided the tribes into a certain number of cantons or townships,  called DEMI, which at a later time were 174 in number.  Every Athenian  citizen was obliged to be enrolled in a demus, each of which, like a  parish in England, administered its own affairs.  It had its public  meetings it levied rates, and was under the superintendence of an  officer called DEMARCHUS.    The establishment of the ten new tribes led to a change in the number  of the Senate.  It had previously consisted of 400 members, but it was  now enlarged to 500, fifty being selected from each of the ten new  tribes.  The Ecclesia, or formal assembly of the citizens, was now  summoned at certain fixed periods; and Clisthenes transferred the  government of the state, which had hitherto been in the hands of the  archons, to the senate and the ecclesia.  He also increased the  judicial as well as the political power of the people; and enacted that  all public crimes should be tried by the whole body of citizens above  thirty years of age, specially convoked and sworn for the purpose.  The  assembly thus convened was called HELIAEA and its members HELIASTS.  Clisthenes also introduced the OSTRACISM, by which an Athenian citizen  might be banished without special accusation, trial, or defence for ten  years, which term was subsequently reduced to five.  It must be  recollected that the force which a Greek government had at its disposal  was very small; and that it was comparatively easy for an ambitious  citizen, supported by a numerous body of partisans, to overthrow the  constitution and make himself despot.  The Ostracism was the means  devised by Clisthenes for removing quietly from the state a powerful  party leader before he could carry into execution any violent schemes  for the subversion of the government.  Every precaution was taken to  guard this institution from abuse.  The senate and the ecclesia had  first to determine by a special vote whether the safety of the state  required such a step to be taken.  If they decided in the affirmative,  a day was fixed for the voting, and each citizen wrote upon a tile or  oyster-shell [OSTRACON, whence the name OSTRACISM] the name of the  person whom he wished to banish.  The votes were then collected, And if  it was found that 6000 had been recorded against any one person, he was  obliged to withdraw from the city within ten days:  if the number of  votes did not amount to 6000, nothing was done.    The aristocratical party, enraged at these reforms called in the  assistance of Cleomenes, king of the Lacedaemonians.  Athens was  menaced by foreign enemies and distracted by party struggles.  Clisthenes was at first compelled to retire from Athens; but the people  rose in arms against Cleomenes, expelled the Lacedaemonians, who had  taken possession of the city, and recalled Clisthenes.  Thereupon  Cleomenes collected a Peloponnesian army in order to establish Isagoras  as a tyrant over the Athenians, and at the same time he concerted  measures with the Thebans and the Chalcidians of Euboea for a  simultaneous attack upon Attica.  The Peloponnesian army, commanded by  the two kings, Cleomenes and Demaratus, entered Attica, and advanced as  far as Eleusis; but when the allies became aware of the object for  which they had been summoned, they refused to march farther, and  strongly protested against the attempt to establish a tyranny at  Athens.  Their remonstrances being seconded by Demaratus, Cleomenes  found it necessary to abandon the expedition and return home.  At a  later period (B.C. 491) Cleomenes took revenge upon Demaratus by  persuading the Spartans to depose him upon the ground of illegitimacy.  The exiled king took refuge at the Persian court.    The unexpected retreat of the Peloponnesian army delivered the  Athenians from their most formidable enemy, and they lost no time in  turning their arms against their other foes.  Marching into Boeotia,  they defeated the Thebans and then crossed over into Euboea, where they  gained a decisive victory over the Chalcidians.  In order to secure  their dominion in Euboea, and at the same time to provide for their  poorer citizens, the Athenians distributed the estates of the wealthy  Chalcidian landowners among 4000 of their citizens, who settled in the  "]]]
