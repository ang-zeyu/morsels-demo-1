On and on rushed the  steed bearing the daring girl rider.    She reached the place of the burned bridge, halted a moment, made a  gesture of despair, and then raced for the bank, down which she would  leap her horse to the ford.    \"Come on! Come on!\" yelled Mr. Pertell. \"That's fine! Come on! You men  there put a little more pep in your riding. Turn and fire at them, Miss  Brown! Fire one shot, and one of you men reel in his saddle. That's the  idea!\"    Estelle had quickly turned and fired, and one man had most realistically  showed that he was hit, afterward slumping from his seat.    Now the girl was at the edge of the bank. She was to make a flying jump  over its edge and come down in the soft sand, sliding to the bottom--in  the saddle if she could keep her seat, rolling over and over if,  perchance, she left it.    \"That's the idea! Get every bit of that, Russ! That's fine!\" yelled Mr.  Pertell.    \"There she goes!\" cried Alice, grasping her sister's arm, and as she  spoke Estelle spurred her horse and it leaped full and fair over the  edge of the embankment. Estelle had made her big jump. Would she come  safely out of it?          CHAPTER VIII    A MASSED ATTACK      While Russ Dalwood and his helper were grinding their cameras, reeling  away at the film on which was being impressed the shifting vision of  Estelle Brown taking her hazardous leap, Alice, Ruth, and the others  were watching to see how the daring young horsewoman would come out of  it.    \"She's going to land in a minute!\" exclaimed Miss Dixon.    \"In a minute? In a half second!\" cried Alice. \"But don't talk!\"    \"There--she's fallen!\" gasped Miss Pennington.    With his feet gathered under him, Petro had come down straight on the  sliding, shifting sand of the embankment. For a moment it looked as  though he had stumbled and that Estelle would be thrown.    But she held a firm rein, and leaned far back in the saddle. The horse  stiffened and then, keeping upright with his forelegs straight out in  front of him and his hind ones bunched under him, he began to slide.    Down the embankment he slid, as the Italian cavalrymen sometimes ride  their horses, with Estelle firm in the saddle. And, as a matter of fact,  the girl said afterward it was from having seen some moving pictures of  these Italian army riders that she got the idea of doing as she did.    \"She won't fall!\" murmured Paul.    \"Oh, I'm so glad! The picture will be a success, won't it?\"    \"I should think so,\" Paul said. \"It certainly was a daring ride.\"    \"I wouldn't mind doing it if I had her horse,\" put in Maurice Whitlow,  smirking at the girls. \"I think you could do that, Miss DeVere,\" and he  looked at Alice.    She turned away with only a murmured reply, but, nothing daunted, the  \"pest\" went on:    \"Estelle is certainly a fine rider. I think she must have been a cowgirl  on a ranch at one time, though she won't admit it.\"    \"She wouldn't to you, at any rate,\" said Paul, significantly.    \"Why not?\"    \"Oh, if you don't know it's of no use to tell you. Look! Now she goes  into the water!\"    The action called for the halting at the top of the embankment of the  Confederate riders, who dared not make the jump. They fired some futile  shots at Estelle, then rode around to a less dangerous descent to try to  catch her. But Estelle was to ford the stream and continue on to the  Union lines with her message.    Reaching the bottom of the slope, her horse gathered himself together  for another bit of moving picture work. At the edge of the stream  another camera man was stationed, for Estelle and her horse were by this  time too far away from Russ and his helper to make good views possible.    Into the water splashed the girl, urging on her spirited horse, that was  none the worse for his jump and his long slide.    \"Good work! Good work!\" cried an assistant director, who was stationed  near the stream to see that all went according to the scenario. \"Keep  on, Miss Brown!\"    Estelle bent low over her horse's neck, to escape possible bullets from  the Confederate guns, and on and on she raced until she pulled up at the  tent of \"General\" DeVere. Here her mission ended, after the father of  Alice and Ruth, in a dusty uniform of a Union officer, had come out in  response to the summons from his orderly.    Estelle slipped from her saddle, registered exhaustion, saluted and held  out the paper she had brought through the Confederate lines at such  risk. Nor was the risk wholly one of the play, for she might have been  seriously hurt in her perilous leap.    But, fortunately, everything came out properly and a fine series of  pictures resulted.    \"I'm so glad!\" Estelle exclaimed, when it was all over, and, divested of  her padding, she sat in her room with Ruth and Alice. \"I want to 'make  good' in this business, and riding seems to be my forte.\"    \"Do you like it better than anything else?\" asked Alice.    \"Yes, I do. And I just love moving pictures, don't you?\"    \"Indeed we do,\" put in Ruth. \"But we were never cut out for riders.\"    \"I'd like it!\" exclaimed Alice. \"I'd like to know how to ride a horse as  well as you do.\"    \"I'll show you,\" offered Estelle. \"I'll be very glad to, and it's easy.  It's like swimming--all you need is confidence, and to learn not to be  afraid of your horse but to trust him. Let me show you some day.\"    \"I believe I will!\" decided Alice, with flashing eyes. \"It will be  great.\"    \"Better ask father,\" suggested Ruth.    \"Oh, he'll let me, I know. We've ridden some, you know; but I would like  to ride as well as Estelle,\" and Alice and Estelle began to talk over  their plans for taking and giving riding lessons. In the midst of the  talk the return of the boy who went daily to the village for mail was  announced.    \"Oh, I hope my new waist has come!\" Alice exclaimed, for she had written  to her dressmaker to send one by parcel post. There was a package for  her--the one she expected--and also some letters, as well as one for  Ruth. Estelle showed no interest when the distribution of the mail was  going on.    \"Don't you expect anything?\" asked Alice.    \"Any what?\"    \"Letters.\"    \"Why, no, I don't believe I do,\" was the slowly given answer. \"I don't  write any, so I don't get any, I suppose,\" and both girls noticed that  there was a far-away look in Estelle's eyes. Perhaps it was a wistful  look, for surely all girls like to get letters from some one.    \"I believe she is estranged from her family,\" decided Alice to her  sister afterward. \"Did you see how pathetic she looked when we got  letters and she didn't?\"    \"Well, I didn't notice anything special,\" Ruth replied. \"But there is  something queer about her, I must admit. She is so absent-minded at  times. This morning I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk, and she  said she had no ticket.\"    \"No ticket?\"    \"Yes, that's what she said. And when I laughed and told her one didn't  need a ticket to walk around Oak Farm, she sort of 'came to' and said  she was thinking about a boat.\"    \"A boat--what boat?\"    \"That was all she said. Then she began to talk about something else.\"    \"Do you know what I think?\" asked Alice, suddenly.    \"No. But then you think so many things it isn't any wonder I can't keep  track of them.\"    \"I think, as I believe I've said before, that she has run away from some  ranch to be in moving pictures. That's why she doesn't write or receive  letters. She doesn't want her folks to know where she is.\"    \"I can hardly believe that,\" declared Ruth. \"She is too nice and refined  a girl to have done anything like that. No, I just think she is a bit  queer, that is all. But certainly she doesn't tell much about herself.\"    However, further speculation regarding Estelle Brown was cut short, as  orders came for the appearance of nearly the entire company in one of  the plays.    The first scene was to take place in a Southern town, and for the  purpose a street had been constructed by Pop Snooks and his helpers.  There was a stately mansion, smaller houses, a store or two and some  other buildings. True, the buildings were but shells, and, in some  cases, only fronts, but they showed well in the picture.    Ruth, Alice, and a number of the girls and women and men were to be the  inhabitants of this village, and were to take part in an alarm and flee  the place when it was known that the Confederate forces were being  driven back and through the place by the Unionists.    \"Come on--get dressed!\" cried Alice, and soon she, her sister, Estelle  and the other women were donning their Southern costumes, wide skirts,  with hoops to puff them out, and broad-brimmed hats, under which curls  showed.    There was to be a massed attack by the Unionists on the town, through  which the Confederates were to flee, and it was the part of Ruth and  Alice to rush from their father's \"mansion\" bearing a few of their  choice possessions.    All was in readiness. The Southern defenders were on the outskirts of  the town, drawn up to receive the Unionists. Toward these Confederates,  their enemies came riding. This was filmed separately, while other  camera men, in the made street, took pictures of the activities there.  Men, women and children went in and out of the houses. Though, as Mr.  Belix Apgar said, \"If you call them houses you might as well call the  smell of an onion a dinner. There ain't nothin' to 'em!\"    Suddenly an excited rider dashed into the midst of the peaceful  activities of the Southern town.    \"They're coming! They're coming!\" he cried, waving his hat. \"The Yankees  are coming!\" This would be flashed on the screen.    Then ensued a wild scene. Colored mammies rushed here and there seeking  their charges. Men began to look to their arms. Then came the advance  guard of the retreating Confederates, turning back to fire at their  enemies.    \"Come on now, Ruth--Alice! This is where we make our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20354"],[0,"Jack of Both Sides: The Story of a School War (#9)"],[1,"upon a desk--and  everyone knew what that meant. Mr. West had entered, and was being kept  waiting.    With what books they had managed to grab--some the right ones, many the  wrong--the boarders slunk red-faced to their places, there to realize  their luck, and perchance to discover their mistakes. Cadbury had no  book at all. Green found himself hugging Toppin's _Little Reader_  instead of _Elementary Physics_; and Hallett might make what use he  could of the March Hare's _English Conversation_ when he came to open  it.    The pages of the masters' registers fairly bristled with black marks  that unhappy morning. Grey was for bringing the enemy to book, and  reporting his evil devices, but his elders quashed the proposal.    \"You silly duffer! As if we couldn't deal with them ourselves. Wait till  lunch. There's a rod in pickle for them, and they know it.\"    Yes, the day-boys had a suspicion that there was a lively time  approaching, but so set-up were they by their recent victory that they  quite looked forward to it.    Jack was less happy. He read the resolve in the boarders' faces, and  knew that they saw no joke in that morning's events. And he wondered  where the war would end. It seemed the final upset of all those little  efforts towards harmony and good-temper to which he had given himself  from the hour of his arrival at Brincliffe.    Among the junior scholars sat a dark-complexioned boy with very white  teeth. It was the March Hare. To-day there was a queer gleam in his  eyes, and a flush of carmine in his sallow cheeks. His _English  Conversation_ was not to be found when wanted, and the fact called down  upon him a sharp rebuke from a master, but his face expressed no regret.    \"There must have been a ringleader in this,\" remarked another boarder in  his hearing during a momentary absence of the master. \"I wish to  goodness we knew who it was!\"    \"A reng-lidder?\" repeated the March Hare. \"I don' know zat word. But if  you mean ze boy who done ze much most--ze baddest of all ze bads--ah, I  know him! Yes, I mark him long, long time. An' I wait.\"    \"What d'ye mean, Harey? Who is it?\"    \"Nev-er mat-ter,\" said the March Hare mysteriously; and at that point  Mr. Anderson re-entered the room.    On went the hands of the clock. At one minute to eleven all was peaceful  and orderly. At eleven the masters departed for the usual brief  interval. At one minute past eleven all was war and tumult!    How, where, with whom the conflict commenced it is impossible to say.  There was no warning, no formal outbreak--only in a moment the quiet  room became a battle-field, filled with a seething crowd of furious,  struggling lads.    An odd feature of the battle was its comparative silence. It was to  everyone's interest to avoid attracting attention, and the sound of  blows was louder than the sound of voices.    Here, Bacon was felled by Trevelyan; there, Vickers by Mason. The result  was the same in either case. The fallen arose undaunted and without a  word; only a look of keener determination settled on each face.    There was scarcely time for rallying, but, as far as was possible, the  day-boys closed in together to resist the attack of their more numerous  foes. Hughes and poor Frere both found themselves forced into battle,  willy-nilly. Jack, whose natural instinct was to side with the weaker  party, found neutrality impossible, and the part he had chosen very  hard. The day-boys were prepared for his vagaries, but the boarders were  perplexed and bewildered by his conduct. Was he partisan or traitor? One  moment they saw him pressing his handkerchief to Green's bleeding nose;  the next he was forcing a way for plucky Simmons to reach his friends:  now he must needs shut Toppin up in the book-room for safety--against  his will, of course; then he was heard imparting to the tearful Frere a  few hints on self-defence.    Very soon there was no doubt in which direction the tide of victory was  flowing. Numbers began to tell, and the day-boys were being forced  steadily backwards towards the wall, away from the class-rooms, where  they had hoped, if necessary, to be able to entrench themselves.    A foolish idea of making use of the long table suggested itself to  Mason. A tug and a shove, and they had pulled it round to shield them.    \"You lunatics! You're giving them twenty fresh chances at once!\" cried  Jack desperately. \"They can squeeze you into surrendering directly!\"    \"I believe he's right!\" muttered Bacon, and they strove to get free  again.    But it was not easy to rid themselves of the table when once they were  ranked behind it. The boarders saw their opportunity, and a last fierce  combat began.    Something--Jack never knew what it was--suddenly impelled him to dive  under the table.    \"Oh, Jack, we don't fight underground!\" exclaimed Cadbury mockingly; but  Jack paid no heed.    Cadbury was wrong; there was a very definite attack being made beneath  cover of the table, where it was least suspected. An attack, too, of a  kind that would have been thought impossible.    It was very dark under there, but Jack was at once certain that he was  not the only hider from the light. A small, lithe figure was wriggling  along the floor in front of him, passing one pair of legs after another,  but scanning each in turn.    Jack's hand was almost upon it. The words \"This isn't fair play!\" were  bursting from his lips, when the figure ceased to crawl. It was opposite  a pair of ribbed brown stockings clothing two sturdy legs, when it  stopped, and drew something forth from somewhere about its person.    At sight of this, a chill of horror seemed to freeze Jack, and for the  moment he was struck dumb. Stiffly he put forward a hand which seized,  as in a grip of iron, the thin right arm of the figure before him. It  was the arm of the March Hare, and in its hand was an open penknife.    The sudden clutch was wholly unexpected, and the knife dropped. With his  other hand Jack picked it up. As he did so, the March Hare uttered a  cry. It was neither loud nor long, but there was something so startling  in it that the commotion of the fight ceased suddenly, and in the midst  of a strange stillness Jack emerged, dragging his captive by one hand,  and holding the open penknife in the other.    [Illustration]    If a white flag had been raised, the battle could not have ended more  abruptly. For a few seconds nothing was heard but quick, short breaths  on all sides. Presently Hallett's voice, hoarse and low, asked:    \"What does it mean, Brady?\"    Jack, white to the lips, pointed from the Hare to Armitage, then to the  spot where he had found him. The Hare was shivering and sobbing.    \"Hallett--I hear you say knifes--war wiz knifes! I on'y go to ze  Toppeen-drowner. I not wasn' going to hurt--on'y to preeck! I never hol'  knife no more! I promise! I swear!\"--here he crossed himself rapidly--\"I  promise 'gain! I--\"    But at this point the English language failed the Hare, who sank upon  his knees, wringing his hands and gesticulating wildly, as he gabbled,  nobody knew what, in Italian.    Hallett, meanwhile, was looking grave and stern as the boys had never  seen him. There was not a trace of the fiery tyrant they knew so well.  He was face to face with a hard duty, and it awed him.    \"I'm sorry,\" he said quietly, \"but this is too serious to be covered up.  I have no choice. I must take you straight to the head. Brady, hand me  over the penknife! Or bring it along, and come too!\"    Jack shook his head as he passed the knife, and Norman Hallett and  Massimiliano Graglia left the room in company. Two masters returning  met the pair, but Hallett's face wore an expression which forbade  questions.    When presently he re-entered the school-room, it was alone.    And for the space of a week the March Hare was unseen by his  school-fellows.          CHAPTER VII    HANNAH THE HOUSEMAID      There was an end of open strife among the Brincliffe boys. The sight of  that little glittering blade had brought them up short with an  unpleasant shock. They stood astounded for a minute, making no attempt  to remove the traces of the conflict, even when they heard the sound of  the masters' approach. They stood convicted, all together; their  disordered dress, collars unfastened and rumpled hair, the untasted  luncheon, the confusion of the furniture, all told most graphically the  tale of a quarrel.    Silent and ashamed they slunk back into their places when the  head-master at last returned to the school-room. But, to the universal  surprise, he only addressed a few short, grave sentences to them on the  subject, and announced that henceforth a master would have charge of  the room during the luncheon interval.    \"Hitherto, boys, I have allowed you considerable liberty, regarding you,  though young, as civilized and Christian gentlemen. You have shown me I  was mistaken. Therefore I must treat you differently until I see you  become what I hoped you already were. You might do worse than strive to  attain to this. To your classes, if you please!\"    \"Does anyone know where Trevelyan minor is?\" enquired Mr. Anderson  presently, looking into the mathematical class-room.    Jack sprang from his seat.    \"Yes, I know! Please, sir,\" turning to his master, \"will you excuse me?\"    \"No need for you to come, Brady,\" interposed Mr. Anderson; \"tell me  where he is, that's all.\"    Jack hesitated; then, putting his hand in his pocket, drew out a key.    \"He's in the book-room, sir. And it's locked.\"    Now, as the book-room opened out of the school-room, in which Mr. West  was teaching, it was impossible that the door could be unlocked, and  Toppin released, without the fact becoming known to him. He looked up at  sound of the key, and the sight of the small, red-haired urchin, seated  disconsolately on a globe within, and swinging his short legs, evoked a  question.    \"What has that lad been doing, Mr. Anderson? Did you"]]]
