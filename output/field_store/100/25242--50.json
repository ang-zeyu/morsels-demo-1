Further examination, in the following year, satisfied the  architect that no spire had ever been erected on the lantern, and that  even if Walsingham had ever intended to have one, he had yet finished  his work without any preparation for such an addition. A design for such  a spire was, however, prepared and submitted to the dean and chapter,  but it was never adopted.    As was to be expected, many opinions were expressed upon the design.  Some wanted the whole to be surmounted by a pyramidal capping. It was  objected that the design was a stone construction for what must of  necessity be erected of wood. It was pointed out that Walsingham used  his upper story as a bell-chamber, and argued that a true restoration  should aim at reproducing this feature. In the end Scott's design was  carried out exactly as proposed, except that the eight small square  turrets of the wooden lantern have no pinnacles.    The enumeration of works completed in 1866, as given by Dean Goodwin  above, did not include several important and costly gifts. The chief of  these were: the carved panels above the stalls, supplied by individual  donors; a pinnacle at the south-east corner of the choir (Mr. Beresford  Hope); the reredos (Mr. J. Dunn Gardner); the font (Canon Selwyn); the  gates of aisles of presbytery (Mr. Lowndes and Dean Peacock); the brass  eagle lectern (Canon E. B. Sparke); and the monumental effigies of Bishop  Allen and Dr. Mill. Canon E. B. Sparke had also contributed to the  restoration of the south transept; Mr. H. R. Evans, sen., and Mr. H. R.  Evans, jun., had helped with the works in the west tower; the Rev. G.  Millers, minor canon, had bequeathed L100, and his residuary legatees  gave another L300, which was applied to the ceiling of the nave; Miss  Allen, daughter of the bishop, also bequeathed L500, appropriated to a  new pulpit; and Bishop Turton left the same amount for re-paving the  nave.    The only other work of importance done before Dean Goodwin left for  Carlisle was the reconstruction of the organ. Canon Dickson, in his  admirable historical account of the organ, is confident that the  instrument in use in 1831 was the original pre-Reformation organ,  gradually enlarged from time to time with \"all the improvements  suggested by the progress of musical and mechanical art.\" Its  preservation during the Commonwealth period is possibly due to the  personal influence of Oliver Cromwell. About that date (1831) the organ  was rebuilt by Elliott and Hill. It was fitted into the old cases, of  Renaissance design. From the similarity of these cases to some which are  known to have inclosed organs built by Renatus Harris, the old organ has  sometimes been attributed to him; but there is \"no record whatever of  the employment of Harris by the Dean and Chapter.\"    The progress made in the time of Dean Merivale (1869-1894) was steady  and substantial, but calls for no detailed account. The foundations of  many parts of the building were made more secure; much of the pavement  was renewed; the tower at the west was strengthened with iron bands;  several stained glass windows were inserted. Perhaps the most  noteworthy undertaking of this period was the decoration of the  interior, and the completion of the series of pinnacles of the exterior,  of the octagon and lantern. In a summary of the amount spent between  1843 and 1898 the total, exclusive of special gifts, is given at L69,543  1_s._ 0_d._[31]      FOOTNOTES:       [1] The origin of the name Ely has been discussed in \"Fenland         Notes and Queries,\" ii., pp. 316, 371.

Other churches with this dedication occur         at Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, West Halton, Lincolnshire,         Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Norwich, and S. Audrie's, in         Somerset. The writer has not been able to discover the sixth.

THE CATHEDRAL: EXTERIOR.      Few persons would dispute the statement that for external grandeur of  effect the cathedral at Ely is surpassed only, if at all, in England by  Durham and Lincoln. With the natural advantages of position enjoyed by  those cathedrals Ely cannot compete. In both these cases, also, there  are grand mediaeval buildings of great size near at hand, that group  well with the cathedrals and materially improve the effect. But,  compared with the adjacent country, Ely does stand on an eminence, and  consequently can be seen from a great distance in all directions. At  Durham the distant view is limited by the hilly nature of the district;  Lincoln, except on the north side, can probably be seen more than thirty  miles off, from the ground.[1] Ely can be seen quite well from the  tower of Peterborough--about thirty-five miles as the crow flies. Ely is  nearly, but not quite, the highest spot in the Fenland. One place in Ely  is 109 feet above mean sea-level. The highest elevation in the Fenland  is near Haddenham, some five miles to the south-west of Ely, where a few  bench-marks give 121 and 122 feet above sea-level.    It is not only its magnificence that makes the view of Ely Cathedral so  remarkable, there is also the feeling that it has so many striking  features, to which we can find nothing to compare. \"The first glimpse of  Ely overwhelms us, not only by its stateliness and variety of its  outline, but by its utter strangeness, its unlikeness to anything else.\"  So says Professor Freeman[2] and again: \"Ely, ... with its vast single  western tower, with its central octagon unlike anything else in the  whole world, has an outline altogether peculiar to itself.\"    Although Ely, with the single exception of Wells,[3] is the smallest of  the ancient episcopal cities[4] of England, the area of the cathedral  is exceeded only by four others--York, S. Paul's, Lincoln, and  Winchester. The church certainly gives the impression of being out of  all proportion to the town.[5] There has been nothing to occasion any  considerable increase in the number of the inhabitants. Sixty years ago  there were within about four hundred as many as now. The town, as has  been pointed out above, grew out of the foundation of the monastery.  \"The history of Ely is the history of Wells, Lichfield, Peterborough,  Bury Saint Edmunds, and a crowd of others, where the church came first  and the town grew up at the gate of the bishop or abbot.\" The great  wealth of the monastery accounts for the original magnificence of the  church; and even when the resources both of the see and the cathedral  body were reduced, they were still amply sufficient to maintain the  fabric without the loss of any material portion of it. We have no  knowledge of the occasion of the ruin of the northern part of the west  transept, but there is no suggestion that it was allowed to fall through  want of means to keep it up.    #The West Front.#--The visitor will naturally commence his  investigation of the cathedral with studying the view of the tower from  the west; and here he should endeavour to picture to himself the  appearance of the west front as it originally stood. It has, indeed,  been questioned whether the northern limb of the western transept had  ever been really completed. The prevailing opinion is that it was  completed, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#9)"],[1,"if in their bewilderment they mistook the  ship for some immense bird pointing the way to land and safety!    [Illustration: Tired Migrating Birds Often Alight on Ships]    _Keeping Migration Records._--More than thirty {80} years ago the  United States Government put into operation a plan for collecting and  tabulating information concerning the dates on which migratory birds  reach various points in their journeys.  More than two thousand  different observers located in various parts of the country have  contributed to these records, many of the observers reporting annually  through a long series of years.  As a result of this carefully gathered  material, with the addition of many data collected from other sources,  there is now on file in Washington an immense volume of valuable  information, much of which, in condensed printed form, is obtainable by  the public.  This work was in charge of Professor Wells W. Cooke,  Biologist, in the Biological Survey of the United States Department of  Agriculture until his lamented death in the spring of 1916.  Who will  take charge of it hereafter is not yet determined; but students may  obtain from the director of the Survey migration schedule blanks upon  application, and bulletins describing the emigration habits of various  North American birds.  {81} Watching for the annual appearance of the  first individual of each species is most fascinating occupation.

C.          {82}    CHAPTER V    THE BIRDS IN WINTER    With the approach of winter the country loses its charm for many people.  The blossoms and verdure, so common yet so beloved by all, have departed,  and only the brown expanses of dead grass and weeds relieve the blackness  of the forest trees.  Even ardent nature lovers have been known to  forsake their walks at this season when the songs of the birds have  ceased and the forest boughs give forth only sobs and shrieks as they  sway to the strength of the north winds.    _A Good Time for Field Walks._--Nevertheless winter is a good time for  the bird student to go afield.  If the wild life is less abundant, so is  the human life, and you have the country almost to yourself.  If you but  say in your heart, \"I will go and see what may be {83} found,\" you will  later rejoice, for with the falling of the leaves many of Nature's  secrets, which she has jealously guarded through the summer months, stand  revealed.  Among the naked branches of the briars you may find the  Catbird's nest which defied all search last June.  It will be a comfort  to learn that the bird really did have a nest just about the place you  thought it was located.  Many other pleasing surprises await you in the  winter woods.    _The Downy's Winter Quarters._--One late autumn day I stopped to watch a  Junco feeding among some weed stalks near a hillside trail.  After  remaining motionless for a minute or two I became conscious of a light  muffled tapping somewhere near by.  It did not take long to locate the  sound.  On the underside of a slanting decayed limb, twenty feet above,  was a new, well-rounded hole perhaps an inch in diameter.  Even as I  looked the occupant came to the entrance and threw out a billful of small  chips.  When these fell, I saw that the dead leaves on the earth beneath  had been well sprinkled by previous ejections {84} of the same nature.  I  had discovered a Downy Woodpecker at work on his winter bedroom, and  later I had reason to believe that he made this his nightly retreat  during the cold months that followed.    Chancing to pass this way one dark cloudy morning, it occurred to me to  look and see if he had yet left his bed.  Striking the limb near the hole  I was rewarded by seeing a little black-and-white head poked out  inquiringly.  Fearing he might be resentful if such treatment were  repeated, I never afterward disturbed my little neighbour while he was  taking his morning nap.  But I had learned this much, that one Downy at  least sometimes liked to be abed on cold mornings.  Perhaps he knew that  there was no early worm about at this season.    _Birds and the Night._--It may be that others of our winter birds also  make excavations for sleeping quarters; the Chickadee and Nuthatch very  probably do so, although I have never found them thus engaged.  It is  well known that many small birds creep into holes to pass the night.  Old  nesting {85} places of Woodpeckers are thus again rendered useful, and  many of the natural cavities of trees contain, during the hours of  darkness, the little warm, pulsating bodies of birds.    Quails invariably roost on the ground regardless of the time of year, or  the prevailing weather conditions.  An entire covey numbering sometimes  twelve or fifteen will settle for the night in a compact circular group  with heads pointed outward.  When a heavy snow falls they are completely  buried, and then if a hard crust forms before morning their roosting  place becomes their tomb.  Grouse now and then are trapped in the same  way, but their superior strength enables them to break through and  escape.  In fact, these larger birds often deliberately go to roost  beneath the snow, breaking through the crust by a swift plunging dive  from the air.  Bearing these facts in mind it is easy to understand why  Quails often become scarce in a country where Grouse abound.    Small birds pass the winter nights in evergreens, thick-growing vines,  under the eaves of verandas, or {86} on the rafters of bridges.  Many  creep into cracks of outhouses.  I have found them at night in caves,  barns, and once in a covered wagon.  Almost any available shelter may  have its bird tenant on cold nights, who if undisturbed will often return  again and again to the refuge it has once found safe and comfortable.    Birds that pass the winter in the Northern States are subjected to many  hardships.  In fact, the fatalities in the bird world in winter are so  great, and the population so constantly reduced by one form of tragedy or  another, that it is only the stronger and more fortunate individuals of a  species that survive to enjoy the summer.    _The Food Question in Winter._--Where to secure the food is the big  question which confronts every bird when it opens its eyes on the first  snowy morning of winter.  Not only has the whole aspect of the country  been changed, but the old sources of food have passed away.  Not a  caterpillar is to be found on the dead leaves, and not a winged insect is  left to come flying {87} by; hence other food must be looked for in new  directions.  Emboldened by hunger, the Starlings alight at the kitchen  door, and the Juncos, Sparrows, Downy Woodpeckers, and Nuthatches come to  feed on the window-sill.  Jays and Meadowlarks haunt the manure piles or  haystacks in search of fragments of grain.  Purple Finches flock to the  wahoo elm trees to feed on the buds, and Crossbills attack the pine  cones.  Even the wary Ruffed Grouse will leave the shelter of the barren  woods, and the farmer finds her in the morning sitting among the branches  of his apple tree, relieving the twigs of their buds.  In every field a  multitude of weed stalks and stout grass stems are holding their heads  above the snow tightly clasping their store of seeds until members of the  Sparrow family shall thrash them out against the frozen crust beneath.    Among those which are forced to become largely vegetarian in winter is  the Bluebird.  In summer he is passionately fond of grasshoppers,  cutworms, and _Arctia_ caterpillars, but now he wanders sadly over {88}  the country of his winter range in quest of the few berries to be found  in the swamps and along the hedgerows.  The Crow is another bird often  met in winter walks, for he, too, in many cases spurns the popular  movement southward in the fall, and severe indeed must be the weather  before he forsakes his former haunts.  You will find him feeding along  the banks of streams or in the open spots in the fields, or {89} again in  the woods pecking rotten stumps or fallen limbs in search of dormant  beetles.    [Illustration: Grouse \"Budding\" in an Apple Tree]    Fifty-five species of Warblers inhabit North America.  These birds are  insectivorous in their feeding habits, which of course also means that  they are migratory.  A partial exception to the rule is found in the  common Myrtle Warbler.  Although in winter these birds range south to  Panama, many remain as far north as New Jersey, Kansas, and the Ohio  Valley.  This does not mean that insects are found in these regions in  sufficient numbers to supply the larder of the Myrtle Warblers, but it  does mean that they find acceptable substitutes for their usual food.  Oddly enough, what they depend on is not animal matter in any form, but  consists of berries which contain some of the essential food properties  of fatty meats.  One of the most popular with them is the common bayberry.    Among the sand dunes of the extensive \"Banks\" along the North Carolina  coast there grows in great profusion a small bushy tree known as the  yaupon.  {90} The young leaves of this when dried and steeped make a very  acceptable drink, and during the hungry days of the Civil War when the  Federal blockade became effective the people of the region used this as a  substitute for tea and coffee.  The yaupon produces in great abundance a  berry that is so highly esteemed by the Myrtle Warblers that they pass  the winter in these regions in numbers almost incredible.    _When the Food Supply Fails._--It is hard to realize the extent of the"]]]
