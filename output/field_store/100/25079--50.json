They also mingled considerably in general society, for Mary was  then very fond of dancing, although there was rarely or never any at  her Friday evenings, for literary people then, as now, eschewed the  goddess Terpsichore.    \"I told you that I arrived in New York upon brother's reception-night.  Those Friday evenings wore a great source of pleasure to me,  introducing me as they did to the literary coterie of the metropolis.  Nearly all the men and women of note at that time met in our parlors on  Greenwich Street, and many of them were regular or occasional  contributors to brother's journal.  Among the names that I can recall,  were Gen. Morris, then editing the _New York Mirror_; the two Clark  brothers, editors of the _Knickerbocker_, one of whom, Willis Gaylord  Clark, was at that time writing his clever 'Ollapodiana;' Fitz-Greene  Halleck, the poet; George M. Snow, who later in life became financial  editor of _The Tribune_, and is now deceased; Professor A. C. Kendrick,  of Hamilton College, the translator of Schiller's 'Victor's Triumph,'  which subsequently appeared in _The New Yorker_, and which, you will  remember, your uncle has occasionally read for us at our own Tuesday  evening receptions; Mrs. O. M. Sawyer, the accomplished wife of  brother's pastor, then making her _debut_ in the literary world with  poems and occasional translations from the German; Elizabeth Jessup  Eames, who was writing stories and poems for _The New Yorker_, under  the signature of 'Stella;' Mrs. E. F. Ellet, in 1836 a handsome young  bride, who had come up from the South, and was contributing  translations from the French and German to the same journal; Anne Cora  Lynch, now Madame Botta; and many others.    \"I must not forget to mention Fisher, the sub-editor of _The New  Yorker_, and, in his own estimation, the most important person upon  that journal.  He was what might be called a literary fop, and was much  given to the production of highly-wrought, Byronic poems and sketches.  I remember hearing that some one called one day at the office, and  asked to see the editor.  Fisher immediately presented himself.    \"'What!' said the visitor, somewhat surprised, 'are you Mr. Greeley?'    \"'No,' said Fisher, running his fingers nonchalantly through his curls,  'I am not Mr. Greeley, but,' drawing himself up, 'I am the editor of  _The New Yorker_.  Mr. Greeley is only the printer.'    \"This incident having got out among brother's friends, it was  considered so good a joke that for years he was called in the office  and by the literary fraternity, 'The Printer.'    \"The entertainment at these Friday evenings was mainly conversation,  varied by the occasional reading of a poem.  Your Aunt Mary was much  admired that winter, both for her exquisite beauty and the charm of her  winning, artless manners.  As I said, she was very fond of dancing; but  brother never had time to accomplish himself in the art.  I remember,  however, that at a Christmas party given by his partner, Mr. Wilson, he  was induced to dance a quadrille.  His mathematical accuracy enabled  him to go through the figures perfectly, when he had once seen them  danced; and he enjoyed it so thoroughly, and wore such an air of  unconscious happiness, that an old Quaker lady (the mother-in-law of  Mr. Wilson) who was looking on remarked to me, 'I didn't think thee  could find so beautiful a sight as thy brother's dancing this side of  heaven.'    \"I have described your Aunt Mary as beautiful, and perhaps you would  infer that she was also over-fond of dress.  She was no devotee to  fashion, and her toilet was, even at that period, characterized by  great simplicity, but was noted, at the same time, for picturesqueness.\"    Ida showed me, the other day, a very interesting letter written to her  father by a friend, Mr. Yancey, who was present at his marriage, and as  it confirms what mamma has said of Aunt Mary's beauty, I will make some  extracts from it.  Mr. Yancey was the son-in-law of Squire Bragg, at  whose house Aunt Mary resided while teaching school in North Carolina.      \"GERMANTOWN, TENNESSEE, _July 6, 1847_.    \"MR. GREELEY:    \"DEAR SIR:--Sitting to-night 'all solitary and alone,' my mind has  wandered back upon scenes that have past eleven years ago, though vivid  now even as yesterday.  It was about that time that I saw you first,  and indeed saw you last.    \"Little did I then dream that I beheld in that modest personage one who  is now acknowledged as the 'distinguished and accomplished Horace  Greeley.'    \"You well remember your first visit to the South, I dare say.  You  cannot have forgotten many incidents that occurred at a little village  of North Carolina, called Warrenton?  No, there is _one_ circumstance I  feel assured you never can forget while memory lasts, and there are  others to which I claim the right to call your attention: for instance,  do you remember your first meeting with a certain Miss Cheney at the  house of Squire Bragg, the father of Capt. Bragg, who lately  distinguished himself at Monterey and Buena Vista?  Do you now remember  to whom you related the secret of your visit, who procured the parson,  and what persons accompanied you to church, and then with your  beautiful bride returned to breakfast?  We saw you take the solemn  vows, we witnessed the plighted betrothal, and when you bore away from  us this prize, you also carried our best wishes that you might be ever  blessed, and she be made always happy.  May it not have been otherwise.\"    . . . . \"I would, my dear sir, be pleased to hear from you, and to  learn something of the results and changes which time has brought about  in your own family.    \"Be pleased to remember me to your sweet wife, and if there be any, or  many little G------s, my kind regards to them also.    \"Very respectfully,    \"A. L. YANCEY.\"          CHAPTER VI.    Visitors--Our Neighbors--The Chappaqua Croquet Club--Gabrielle's  Letter--A Hiding Party--Summer Heat--The Music-room--Friends from the  City.      _June 18_.    While out on the croquet ground this afternoon, a lady and gentleman  alighted from a carriage, and walked up to join us.  They proved to be  our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Wilbour, of New York, who had  driven over from White Plains to make us an afternoon call.  Mrs.  Wilbour is a charming, intellectual woman, the president of Sorosis,  and a friend of many years of both mamma and Aunt Mary.  In appearance  she is tall, handsome, and queenly, dressing in perfect taste, and a  graceful hostess.  Her pretty daughter Linny is a school friend of  Gabrielle's at St. Mary's.    Mr. and Mrs. Wilbour spend much time during the summer, driving about  from one town to another; certainly the most comfortable and agreeable  mode of travelling that one could adopt.    We have some agreeable neighbors here, who contribute somewhat to the  general entertainment.  The aristocracy of Chappaqua are chiefly Quaker  families who have lived here since the days of the Indians, and who  look down quite doubtfully upon the New York families who come out here  for the summer only, and of whose ancestry they know nothing.  The  fathers and mothers wear the Quaker dress, and use the \"Friends\"  phraseology, which I think very pretty and caressing, but the young  people depart somewhat from the way of grace, in speech, costume, and  habits.  The young girls wear whatever color of the rainbow best suits  their fresh complexions, are skilled in flirting, and with the  assistance of the young gentlemen, have organized a club for weekly  croquet parties and private theatricals at the residences of the  different members, whilst picnics and riding-parties to Croton and Rye  Lakes, and other pretty points of interest, are of frequent occurrence.  But of the riding-parties Gabrielle has just written a sprightly  description to a school friend, and before the letter goes to the post,  I will transcribe it.      CHAPPAQUA, _June 18_.    \"DEAR MOLLIE: I received your charming letter and photograph last week.  Many thanks for both.  You ask me how do I pass my time, and what is  the latest excitement?    \"Well, to begin with, you must know that we have just started a club in  Chappaqua for mutual amusement, but as I have been indisposed for some  time, I certainly have not yet derived much benefit from it, but spend  most of my time reading.    \"Last Saturday I was just longing for something to happen, and  apostrophizing the world as a hollow sham, when Minna came up to say  that we had all been invited to an equestrian party, to start after  tea.  You would have imagined I had been offered several kingdoms by my  delight.  I gave two or three screams of condensed joy, while dancing  wildly around the room, much to Aunt Esther's surprise.    \"But on second thoughts, what _was_ I to do for a horse?  My ponies had  never been broken to the saddle, but having made up my mind to go, go I  would, if I had to ride a wild buffalo; so I ordered Lady Alice around  an hour before the time to start.  When she arrived, the balcony was  filled with a large and anxious audience, and rather than fail before  so many, I was determined that either I should break the horse in, or  she should break me.  I sprang into the saddle, but before I could seat  myself or put my foot in the stirrup, she jerked her head away from  Bernard, and commenced a series of exciting manoeuvres, rearing,  plunging, and kicking.  For about five minutes I defied all the laws of  gravitation.  But when the coachman tried to seize her bridle, she  shied so suddenly that I was surprised to find myself on terra firma.  I jumped up directly and assured every one that I had not hurt myself  in the least, in fact had never felt better; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#9)"],[1,"the law, moderate and inefficient as was the  law at that time. (Since then the law has been altered both in  Scotland and Ireland, but I do not know what are the provisions,  nor what has been the effect of the new law.) It required that  there should be a free passage for the fish (Salmon) through all  the traps, nets, weirs, and devices that were used to catch or  detain them, from sunset on Saturday night to sunrise on Monday  morning. One man said he paid L7,000 a year for his fishery, and  should lose one-seventh of his catch. Another said he allowed a  free passage on Sundays, but would not permit anybody to go and  examine for themselves. A third proved that he allowed the fish a  free passage on Sundays, but his neighbours proved that he placed  in the gap a crocodile, painted red. And a fourth was convicted of  breaking down the stake nets in the estuary of a river--at the  same time he had a net stretched entirely across the river above,  both day and night. And so with many others, every one striving  with all his might to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.    This is not the way to improve the Salmon fisheries. To do this  effectually the upper proprietors must have a strong interest in  the preservation of the breeding of fish, and in order to give  them this interest they ought to have an ample supply of fish when  they are in the best condition; but to give them this supply the  law ought to be altered. At present I believe the law does not  require a free passage for the fish (at least in English rivers)  except from Saturday night to Monday morning; in many of them I  believe this is not insisted upon; whereas the law ought to  prohibit fishing for or obstructing the passage of the fish every  night from sunset to sunrise, and this regulation ought to be  rigorously enforced. This would give the upper proprietors a  chance of having good fish, and a corresponding inducement to take  care of them. Nobody would be so much benefited as the owners of  fisheries at the mouths of rivers; they would be the first takers,  and would still get the lion's share of all the fish that ascended  the river. If this regulation were enforced, the expenses of  conservators might be defrayed by levying a small tax, in the  shape of a licence for angling, which all true sportsmen would be  glad to pay if it gave a reasonable prospect of a well-stocked  river. Now matters are getting worse every day, and notwithstanding  the enormous fecundity of the Salmon (a large one producing 25,000  ova in a season), they are now extinct in some rivers where they  used to be found in my recollection, and in others where they were  once abundant they are now very scarce. No one need to wonder at  this, when he is told that gangs of poachers are on the look-out  for them all through the spawning season. In one winter, some  years ago, I am credibly informed that two hundred Salmon were  taken in one stream within five hundred yards of the spot where  I am now writing. It is nobody's business and nobody's interest to  prevent this, and therefore it goes on openly night and day.    Are there no influential gentlemen in the House of Commons who  will take up this matter and endeavour to get an equitable and  comprehensive law passed for the preservation and increase of the  breed of Salmon? It is a matter of even national importance, and  if duly provided for and properly attended to, I see no  improbability in the supposition that Salmon would again be as  abundant as they were when the apprentices on the banks of the  Ribble stipulated that they should not be compelled to eat Salmon  oftener than three days in the week. The apathy of country  gentlemen in this matter is to me unaccountable. I have some  reason to believe, however, that Government have at all times been  so far from lending their influence to the promotion of any  attempts to amend these laws, that they have obstructed rather  than assisted them, most probably from an idea that the  preservation of the fish would interfere with manufactories. If I  thought that this would be the case, I should not say a word on  the subject; but I am very far from holding such an opinion. So  far from this being the case, I assert without hesitation that  weirs need form no obstruction to the free passage of fish, and  that without impairing the efficiency of the water power. With the  poisonous and filthy mixtures sent by some manufactories down the  rivers, the case is far different, and where this is done the case  is hopeless. Salmon and Trout will rapidly disappear from such  rivers, never to be seen there again, so long as these noxious  contaminations are permitted to flow into them.    * * * * *    ARTIFICIAL BREEDING OF FISH.    CLITHEROE, _December 26th_, 1853.    To the Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"    SIR,--I have read with some interest the letter of your  correspondent, Salmo Salar, on the artificial breeding of fish;  and knowing, as I do, the great interest which the writer feels in  the preservation and increase of his namesakes, I shall be most  happy if my humble efforts in the same cause throw any more light  on the same subject, and in any degree contribute to the same end.    But Mr. Salmo Salar is quite wrong in saying that, with the  exceptions of the experiments made on the banks of the Hodder, by  Ramsbottom, no efforts have been made to increase the number of  Salmon by providing artificial breeding-places. Passing over my  own numerous experiments here for the last fourteen or fifteen  years (which you, Sir, are aware of, though the fishing world is  not), I may refer to the extensive experiments made by Mr. Fawkes,  of Farnley, in 1841 and 1842, and renewed again in 1848 and 1849;  and the whole of which (with the exception of a portion of these  in 1842) were successful. The experiments of Salmo Salar were not  made until 1851 and 1852, and were intended merely to test the  accuracy of an assumption that the impregnation of the ova takes  place long prior to their exclusion; which experiments terminated  in a complete failure. Salmo Salar says that the quantity of  Salmon fry in the river is enormous; and that he has caught five  pounds of them in a single pool in a single day. I have known  three times that quantity caught in the same way. But still this  proves nothing at all, for it is well known that almost all  migratory animals, however solitary their general habits may be,  are gregarious at the time of migration. Witness swallows,  fieldfares, and even woodcocks. Witness also the clouds of small  Eels ascending the rivers in May and June; and if we are to  believe the accounts of travellers, the enormous flocks of  antelopes in Africa, and of bisons in America, are proofs of the  same general law. No doubt Salmo Salar will find, as he says, that  the Samlets are exceedingly abundant in some of the pools, when  they have flocked together for the purpose of migration; but he  may perhaps travel for miles either up or down the river before he  will find any more. It is notorious that, in the tributaries of  the Hodder, they are walled in, in many places, for the purpose of  detaining them, that unscrupulous anglers may get as many of them  as possible before they go to the sea. Salmo Salar is in error  also when he says that Ramsbottom deposited 40,000 in the ponds of  Galway, of which 20,000 are expected to be fruitful. The fact is,  that he deposited 40,000 in December, 1852, of which above 20,000  are now alive and in the ponds, varying from four to five inches  long to two or three, notwithstanding that experiment was made  under very unfavourable circumstances; for there was so much mud  in the stream that supplied the spawning-boxes, that when  Ramsbottom left Galway he was afraid all the ova would be choked  by it.    Salmo Salar seems to think that almost all the ova deposited  naturally come to life, and that very few of those deposited  artificially do so. This, however, is quite contrary to my  experience, and I think that if Salmo Salar will listen to the  evidence he will change his opinion. It is well known that  Salmon are very fond of particular streams, their instinct no  doubt informing them which are suitable to their purpose; and when  one pair of fish have finished spawning, another pair will come  and occupy the same place. Now, what takes place under such  circumstances? The ova which were deposited by the first pair are  rooted up by the second, and their specific gravity is so near  that of the water, that they roll down out of the loose gravel and  are picked up by the Trouts, Par, and other fish that are always  lying in wait just below for that purpose. When Ramsbottom was in  Galway he caught a large Trout, out of whose throat he squeezed a  thousand ova, which were deposited in a spawning-box, many of  which came to life notwithstanding the pit they had escaped from.  The extraordinary avidity with which Trout take Salmon roe as a  bait is also a proof (if that were needed) of their preying upon  it in the spawning beds. Yet, in addition to them, are all the  Par, Bullheads, Eels, Loaches, and aquatic larvae which may be  found swarming in every spawning bed by any one who will look for  them. In addition to these enemies, millions of the ova are  destroyed by being washed away by heavy floods, and as many more  are destroyed by being choked with mud and sand in the spawning  beds as well as by being left dry at low water owing to the Salmon  spawning in places which frequently become quite dry in early  spring. No doubt many of the Salmon fry when they have reached the  sea are destroyed by enemies there, of which we know nothing. But  still, if 500,000 are bred, in addition to all that are reared  naturally, it will represent a larger proportion of the whole than  Salmo Salar seems to suppose; otherwise, how is it that in rivers  where Salmon are protected, or still more in unsettled countries,"]]]
