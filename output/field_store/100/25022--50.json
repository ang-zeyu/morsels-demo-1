There are  also in the margins of these volumes, scores of pen-and-ink sketches  of a most primitive description, depicting the carrying out of the  various rigours of the law. Rough and uncouth as these illustrations  are, they nevertheless possess a good deal of graphic significance,  and I hope to reproduce some of them in facsimile, in a future  publication. They represent, for instance, culprits hanging on the  gallows--sometimes two or three in a row--with a fire kindled  underneath; others attached to stakes in the midst of the flames;  others, again, racing away under the lash of the executioner, &c.,  &c., and thus form a most realistic comment on the judicial severities  recorded in the text.

THE STORY IN BRIEF    OF THE    GUILLE-ALLES LIBRARY,    GUERNSEY.    BY J. LINWOOD PITTS.      In concluding the editorial duties connected with the issue of this  fourth volume of the \"Guille-Alles Library Series,\" it seems to me  that the time is an opportune one for adding some short account of the  origin and foundation of the noble Institution from which the \"Series\"  takes its name. The Guille-Alles Library is proving such an immense  boon to our little insular community, that very naturally, many  inquiries are from time to time made--especially by strangers--as to  how its existence came about.    In order to answer these questions we must go as far back as the year  1834. At that time Mr. Guille--who is a Guernseyman by birth--was but  a boy of sixteen, and had been two years in America. He was serving  his apprenticeship with a well-known firm in New York, and he enjoyed  the privilege of access to a very extensive library in that city,  founded by a wealthy corporation known as _The General Society of  Mechanics and Tradesmen_. The pleasure and profit which he derived  from this source were so great, and made such a deep impression upon  his mind that, young as he was, he formed the resolution that if his  future life proved prosperous, and his position enabled him to do so,  he would one day found a similar institution in his own little native  island of Guernsey. Throughout the whole of his future career this  intention was present with him; and commencing at once,--in spite of  his then very limited means--to purchase books which should form a  nucleus for the anticipated collection, he began to lay the foundation  of the literary treasures which crowd the shelves of the Guille-Alles  Library to-day. At the age of twenty, when out of his apprenticeship,  he found himself the possessor of several hundreds of volumes of  standard works, many of which are now in the Library, and upon which  he must naturally look with peculiar and very legitimate pleasure, as  being the corner stones of the subsequent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17208"],[0,"The Tales of Mother Goose (#9)"],[1,"of the two great warehouses wherein I  have my best furniture: these are of the room where I keep my silver and  gold plate, which is not in everyday use; these open my safes, which  hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and  this is the master-key to all my apartments. But as for this little key,  it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the  ground floor. Open them all; go everywhere; but as for that little  closet, I forbid you to enter it, and I promise you surely that, if you  open it, there's nothing that you may not expect from my anger.\"    She promised to obey exactly all his orders; and he, after having  embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey.    Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the  new-married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the riches of  her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of  his blue beard, which frightened them. They at once ran through all the  rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were so fine and rich, and each  seemed to surpass all others. They went up into the warehouses, where  was the best and richest furniture; and they could not sufficiently  admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets,  stands, tables, and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself  from head to foot. Some of them were framed with glass, others with  silver, plain and gilded, the most beautiful and the most magnificent  ever seen.      [Illustration: \"IF YOU OPEN IT, THERE'S NOTHING YOU MAY NOT EXPECT  FROM MY ANGER.\" p. 67.]    They ceased not to praise and envy the happiness of their friend, who,  in the meantime, was not at all amused by looking upon all these rich  things, because of her impatience to go and open the closet on the  ground floor. Her curiosity was so great that, without considering how  uncivil it was to leave her guests, she went down a little back  staircase, with such excessive haste that twice or thrice she came near  breaking her neck. Having reached the closet-door, she stood still for  some time, thinking of her husband's orders, and considering that  unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation  was so strong she could not overcome it. She then took the little key,  and opened the door, trembling. At first she could not see anything  plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to  perceive that several dead women were scattered about the floor. (These  were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after  the other, because they did not obey his orders about the closet on the  ground floor.) She thought she surely would die for fear, and the key,  which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.    After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she picked up the key,  locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to compose herself;  but she could not rest, so much was she frightened.    Having observed that the key of the closet was stained, she tried two or  three times to wipe off the stain, but the stain would not come out. In  vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand. The stain  still remained, for the key was a magic key, and she could never make it  quite clean; when the stain was gone off from one side, it came again on  the other.    Blue Beard returned from his journey that same evening, and said he had  received letters upon the road, informing him that the business which  called him away was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could  to convince him she was delighted at his speedy return.    Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with  such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.    \"How is it,\" said he, \"that the key of my closet is not among the rest?\"    \"I must certainly,\" said she, \"have left it upstairs upon the table.\"    \"Do not fail,\" said Blue Beard, \"to bring it to me presently.\"    After having put off doing it several times, she was forced to bring him  the key. Blue Beard, having examined it, said to his wife:--    \"How comes this stain upon the key?\"    \"I do not know,\" cried the poor woman, paler than death.    \"You do not know!\" replied Blue Beard. \"I very well know. You wished to  go into the cabinet? Very well, madam; you shall go in, and take your  place among the ladies you saw there.\"    She threw herself weeping at her husband's feet, and begged his pardon  with all the signs of a true repentance for her disobedience. She would  have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard  had a heart harder than any stone.    \"You must die, madam,\" said he, \"and that at once.\"    \"Since I must die,\" answered she, looking upon him with her eyes all  bathed in tears, \"give me some little time to say my prayers.\"    \"I give you,\" replied Blue Beard, \"half a quarter of an hour, but not  one moment more.\"    When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:--    \"Sister Anne,\"--for that was her name,--\"go up, I beg you, to the top of  the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming; they promised me they  would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste.\"    Her sister Anne went up to the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted  wife cried out from time to time:--    \"Anne, sister Anne, do you see any one coming?\"    And sister Anne said:--    \"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which  looks green.\"    In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried to  his wife as loud as he could:--    \"Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.\"    \"One moment longer, if you please,\" said his wife; and then she cried  out very softly, \"Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?\"    And sister Anne answered:--    \"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is  green.\"    \"Come down quickly,\" cried Blue Beard, \"or I will come up to you.\"    \"I am coming,\" answered his wife; and then she cried, \"Anne, sister  Anne, dost thou not see any one coming?\"    \"I see,\" replied sister Anne, \"a great dust, which comes from this  side.\"    \"Are they my brothers?\"    \"Alas! no, my sister, I see a flock of sheep.\"    \"Will you not come down?\" cried Blue Beard.    \"One moment longer,\" said his wife, and then she cried out, \"Anne,  sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?\"    \"I see,\" said she, \"two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.\"    \"God be praised,\" replied the poor wife, joyfully; \"they are my  brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make  haste.\"    Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble.  The distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet, all in  tears, with her hair about her shoulders.    \"All this is of no help to you,\" says Blue Beard: \"you must die;\" then,  taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up his sword in the  air with the other, he was about to take off her head. The poor lady,  turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to  afford her one little moment to her thoughts.    \"No, no,\" said he, \"commend thyself to God,\" and again lifting his arm--    At this moment there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue  Beard stopped suddenly. The gate was opened, and presently entered two  horsemen, who, with sword in hand, ran directly to Blue Beard. He knew  them to be his wife's brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer. He  ran away immediately, but the two brothers pursued him so closely that  they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch. There  they ran their swords through his body, and left him dead. The poor wife  was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to arise  and welcome her brothers.    Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his  estate. She made use of one portion of it to marry her sister Anne to a  young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another portion to buy  captains' commissions for her brothers; and the rest to marry herself to  a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the sorry time she had  passed with Blue Beard.          THE FAIRY.      Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters. The elder was  so much like her, both in looks and character, that whoever saw the  daughter saw the mother. They were both so disagreeable and so proud  that there was no living with them. The younger, who was the very  picture of her father for sweetness of temper and virtue, was withal one  of the most beautiful girls ever seen. As people naturally love their  own likeness, this mother doted on her elder daughter, and at the same  time had a great aversion for the younger. She made her eat in the  kitchen and work continually.    Among other things, this unfortunate child had to go twice a day to draw  water more than a mile and a half from the house, and bring home a  pitcherful of it. One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to  her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink.    \"Oh, yes, with all my heart, Goody,\" said this pretty little girl.  Rinsing the pitcher at once, she took some of the clearest water from  the fountain, and gave it to her, holding up the pitcher all the while,  that she might drink the easier.    The good woman having drunk, said to her:--    \"You are so pretty, so good and courteous, that I cannot help giving you  a gift.\" For this was a fairy, who had taken the form of a poor  country-woman, to see how far the civility and good manners of this  pretty girl would go. \"I will give you for gift,\" continued the Fairy,  \"that, at every word you speak, there shall come out of your mouth  either a flower or a jewel.\"    When this pretty girl returned, her mother scolded at her for staying so  long at the fountain.    \"I beg your pardon, mamma,\" said the poor"]]]
