It is a well-known fact that should a Chinese suffering  from the extreme emaciation of disease be also in the habit of using  the opium-pipe, it is the pipe and not the disease that in ninety-nine  cases out of a hundred will be wrongly blamed as the cause of the  emaciation.    During the year 1893 4275 tons of Indian opium were imported into China.  The Chinese, we are told, plead to us with \"outstretched necks\" to cease  the great wrong we are doing in forcing them to buy our opium. \"Many a  time,\" says the Rev. Dr. Hudson Taylor, \"have I seen the Chinaman point  with his thumb to Heaven, and say, 'There is Heaven up there! There is  Heaven up there!' What did he mean by that? You may bring this opium to  us; you may force it upon us; we cannot resist you, but there is a Power  up there that will inflict vengeance.\" (_National Righteousness_, Dec.  1892, p. 13.)    But, with all respect to Dr. Hudson Taylor and his ingenious  interpretation of the Chinaman's gesture, it is extremely difficult for  the traveller in China to believe that the Chinese are sincere in their  condemnation of opium and the opium traffic. \"In some countries,\" says  Wingrove Cooke, \"words represent facts, but this is never the case in  China.\" Li Hung Chang, the Viceroy of Chihli, in the well-known letter  that he addressed to the Rev. F. Storrs Turner, the Secretary of the  Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade, on May 24th, 1881, a  letter still widely circulated and perennially cited, says, \"the poppy  is certainly surreptitiously grown in some parts of China,  notwithstanding the laws and frequent Imperial edicts prohibiting its  cultivation.\"    Surreptitiously grown in some parts of China! Why, from the time I left  Hupeh till I reached the boundary of Burma, a distance of 1700 miles, I  never remember to have been out of sight of the poppy. Li Hung Chang  continues, \"I earnestly hope that your Society, and all right-minded  men of your country, will support the efforts China is now making to  escape from the thraldom of opium.\" And yet you are told in China that  the largest growers of the poppy in China are the family of Li Hung  Chang.    The Society for the Suppression of Opium has circulated by tens of  thousands a petition which was forwarded to them from the  Chinese--spontaneously, per favour of the missionaries. \"Some tens of  millions,\" this petition says, \"some tens of millions of human beings in  distress are looking on tiptoe with outstretched necks for salvation to  come from you, O just and benevolent men of England! If not for the good  or honour of your country, then for mercy's sake do this good deed now  to save a people, and the rescued millions shall themselves be your  great reward.\" (_China's Millions_, iv., 156.)    Assume, then, that the Chinese do not want our opium, and unavailingly  beseech us to stay this nefarious traffic, which is as if \"the Rivers  Phlegethon and Lethe were united in it, carrying fire and destruction  wherever it flows, and leaving a deadly forgetfulness wherever it has  passed.\" (The Rev. Dr. Wells Williams. \"The Middle Kingdom,\" i., 288.)    They do not want our opium, but they purchase from us 4275 tons per  annum.    Of the eighteen provinces of China four only, Kiangsu, Cheh-kiang,  Fuhkien, and Kuangtung use Indian opium, the remaining fourteen  provinces use exclusively home-grown opium. Native-grown opium has  entirely driven the imported opium from the markets of the Yangtse  Valley; no Indian opium, except an insignificant quantity, comes up the  river even as far as Hankow. The Chinese do not want our opium--it  competes with their own. In the three adjoining provinces of Szechuen,  Yunnan, and Kweichow they grow their own opium; but they grow more than  they need, and have a large surplus to export to other parts of the  Empire. The amount of this surplus can be estimated, because all  exported opium has to pay customs and likin dues to the value of two  shillings a pound, and the amount thus collected is known. Allowing no  margin for opium that has evaded customs dues, and there are no more  scientific smugglers than the Chinese, we still find that during the  year 1893 2250 tons of opium were exported from the province of  Szechuen, 1350 tons from Yunnan, and 450 tons from Kweichow, a total of  4050 tons exported by the rescued millions of three provinces only for  the benefit of their fellow-countrymen, who, with outstretched necks,  plead to England to leave them alone in their monopoly.    Edicts are still issued against the use of opium. They are drawn up by  Chinese philanthropists over a quiet pipe of opium, signed by  opium-smoking officials, whose revenues are derived from the poppy, and  posted near fields of poppy by the opium-smoking magistrates who own  them.    In the City Temple of Chungking there is a warning to opium-eaters. One  of the fiercest devils in hell is there represented gloating over the  crushed body of an opium-smoker; his protruding tongue is smeared with  opium put there by the victim of \"_yin_\" (the opium craving), who wishes  to renounce the habit. The opium thus collected is the perquisite of the  Temple priests, and at the gate of the Temple there is a stall for the  sale of opium fittings.    Morphia pills are sold in Chungking by the Chinese chemists to cure the  opium habit. This profitable remedy was introduced by the foreign  chemists of the coast ports and adopted by the Chinese. Its advantage  is that it converts a desire for opium into a taste for morphia, a mode  of treatment analogous to changing one's stimulant from colonial beer to  methylated spirit. In 1893, 15,000 ounces of hydrochlorate of morphia  were admitted into Shanghai alone.    The China Inland Mission have an important station at Chungking. It was  opened seventeen years ago, in 1877, and is assisted by a representative  of the Horsburgh Mission. The mission is managed by a charming English  gentleman, who has exchanged all that could make life happy in England  for the wretched discomfort of this malarious city. Every assistance I  needed was given me by this kindly fellow who, like nearly all the China  Inland Mission men, deserves success if he cannot command it. A more  engaging personality I have rarely met, and it was sad to think that for  the past year, 1893, no new convert was made by his Mission among the  Chinese of Chungking. (_China's Millions_, January, 1894.) The Mission  has been working short-handed, with only three missionaries instead of  six, and progress has been much delayed in consequence.    The London Missionary Society, who have been here since 1889, have two  missionaries at work, and have gathered nine communicants and six  adherents. Their work is largely aided by an admirable hospital under  Cecil Davenport, F.R.C.S., a countryman of my own. \"Broad Benevolence\"  are the Chinese characters displayed over the entrance to the hospital,  and they truthfully describe the work done by the hospital. In the  chapel adjoining, a red screen is drawn down the centre of the church,  and separates the men from the women--one of the chief pretexts that an  Englishman has for going to church is thus denied the Chinaman, since he  cannot cast an ogling eye through a curtain.          CHAPTER V.    THE JOURNEY FROM CHUNGKING TO SUIFU--CHINESE INNS.      I left the boat at Chungking and started on my land journey, going west  230 miles to Suifu. I had with me two coolies to carry my things, the  one who received the higher pay having also to bring me my food, make my  bed, and pay away my copper cash. They could not speak a single word of  English. They were to be paid for the journey one _4s. 10d._ and the  other _5s. 7d._ They were to be entitled to no perquisites, were to find  themselves on the way, and take their chance of employment on the return  journey. They were to lead me into Suifu on the seventh day out from  Chungking. All that they undertook to do they did to my complete  satisfaction.    On the morning of March 14th I set out from Chungking to cross 1600  miles over Western China to Burma. Men did not speak hopefully of my  chance of getting through. There were the rains of June and July to be  feared apart from other obstacles.    Pere Lorain, the Procureur of the French Mission, who spoke from an  experience of twenty-five years of China, assured me that, speaking no  Chinese, unarmed, unaccompanied, except by two poor coolies of the  humblest class, and on foot, I would have _les plus grandes  difficultes_, and Monsieur Haas, the Consul _en commission_, was equally  pessimistic. The evening before starting, the Consul and my friend  Carruthers (one of the _Inverness Courier_ Carruthers) gave me a lesson  in Chinese. \"French before breakfast\" was nothing to this kind of  cramming. I learnt a dozen useful words and phrases, and rehearsed them  in the morning to a member of the Inland Mission, who cheered me by  saying that it would be a clever Chinaman indeed who could understand  Chinese like mine.    I left on foot by the West Gate, being accompanied so far by A. J.  Little, an experienced traveller and authority on China, manager in  Chungking of the Chungking Transport Company (which deals especially  with the transport of cargo from Ichang up the rapids), whose book on  \"The Yangtse Gorges\" is known to every reader of books on China.    I was dressed as a Chinese teacher in thickly-wadded Chinese gown, with  pants, stockings, and sandals, with Chinese hat and pigtail. In my dress  I looked a person of weight. I must acknowledge that my outfit was very  poor; but this was not altogether a disadvantage, for my men would have  the less temptation to levy upon it. Still it would have been awkward if  my men had taken it into their heads to walk off with my things, because  I could not have explained my loss. My chief efforts, I knew,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#9)"],[1,"pum,\" the  currency of the recent Indians.    A miscellaneous collection includes a hematite stone, wrought in  the shape of a cup weighing half a pound; when rubbed or ground it  furnished the war paint of the savages; also the extremity of a copper  tube, two inches long; needles in bone and shell, from an inch to  six inches long, with grooves round the head, to serve the purpose of  eyes; and plates of mica. The use of mica plates, which are found of  large size in some of the Western mounds, has excited some inquiry.  Of a certain thickness, they make good mirrors. Beside their use  for ornamental purposes, they were probably looking-glasses of the  beauties of the stone age. There was also found a pipe of soap stone,  having a stem five inches long, and a bowl with a broad brim, like a  Quaker's hat.    Of earthenware, there was an endless variety of fragments of the usual  black, grey, or red compressed clay, mixed with pulverized shells or  stones. One kind I have never seen described. The sherds had a red  coating on both sides, an eighth of an inch in thickness, evidently  not a paint or a glaze. The red coloring might have come from the  pottery being burnt in the open air, instead of baked in a furnace,  were not the layer of uniform thickness and of homogeneous paste,  unlike the material of the vessel, which was a gray mixture of clay  and particles of shells.    I give the above memoranda to the general fund of information,  touching a subject that invites inquiry on account of its novelty and  ethnological importance. Every examination of the monumental remains  of the ancient Americans brings to light some new feature in structure  or type of rudimental art. And since archaeology has become a science,  investigators, for half a century, may be looking about for facts to  complete the system auspiciously introduced by the antiquarians of  Northern Europe, and advanced in our own country by the researches  of Caleb Atwater (_Archaeologia Americana_) and by those of the  Smithsonian contributors to knowledge, especially Squier and Davis.  RAMBLER.           *       *       *       *       *      A SMALL WATER WHEEL.--There is in the town of Meriden, Conn., a  Leffel double turbine wheel, running under 240 feet fall and driving  a manufactory. It uses only about one-half of a square inch of water,  and runs at the marvelous speed of 3,000 revolutions per minute, or 50  revolutions per second, which is by far the most rapid rate of motion  ever imparted to a water wheel. This is, also, beyond comparison the  greatest fall applied to the propulsion of a wheel in America. The  wheel at Meriden is of the most diminutive size, scarcely exceeding in  dimensions the old-fashioned \"turnip\" watches which our grandfathers  used to carry in their capacious vest pockets. The complete success of  this wheel has attracted much attention and affords further evidence  of the wide range of adaptability of the Leffel turbine.           *       *       *       *       *    [For the Scientific American.]          SILK CULTURE.    BY W. V. ANDREWS.      A vague notion that silk culture ought to form one of the industrial  pursuits of the American people seems to be prevalent enough; but it  does not take practical hold upon anybody. The nearest approach to  anything practical which we have seen, in late years--excepting, of  course, what has been done in California--occurred in New York in July  last, when a number of gentlemen pledged themselves, according to a  report given in the _Tribune_ of July 30, \"to promote the native silk  trade.\"    The gentlemen present at the meeting represented the most prominent  silk manufacturing and importing houses in this country. What these  gentlemen have since done towards promoting the native silk trade, I  do not know, but, having pledged themselves, it is presumed they have  done something.    At the meeting, of which the _Tribune_ article is a report, dags,  and other things, manufactured from California silk, were exhibited;  and the report goes on to say that \"Mr. Warren also exhibited samples  of native and foreign cocoons, and of raw and thrown silk, together  with the common _Cecropia_ and _Bombyx Cynthia_, species of  silkworms which feed upon oak leaves.  *  *  Also the _Bombyx Yamamai_  which feeds upon mulberry leaves; also the _Bombyx Pernyi_, of  which the cocoons are early as good as the cocoons of worms fed upon  mulberry leaves.\"    I have given this extract, word for word, as it stands in the columns  of the _Tribune_, because it contains more blunders of one kind or  another than I remember ever to have seen in so many words. _Cecropia_  is certainly not very particular as to its food, but it is not an oak  feeder. _Cynthia_ will thrive on nothing except ailanthus, though it  will eat one or two other things, but not oak. The _Yamamai_, on  the other hand, will eat oak, indeed it is its natural food; but Mr.  Warren errs greatly when he says that it will feed on mulberry. The  last clause of the sentence, which says that cocoons of _Pernyi_ are  nearly as good as those of worms fed on mulberry leaves, must be a  sort of entomological joke, of which the point is not discoverable by  me, so I pass it over.    I do not, however, notice this report on account of its grammatical  and entomological mistakes. It is because of the evil effects it may,  and probably will, have on amateur silk culturists, that I notice  it; for most assuredly, failure will be the result of all attempts  to produce silk cocoons by feeding the caterpillars of the different  moths on the food prescribed by Mr. Warren. Any patriotic, money  making farmer, who believes in the _Tribune_, purchasing _Yamamai_  eggs and setting his worms to feed upon mulberry, which they refuse to  eat, and consequently, all die, will probably give up silk culture  as being nothing more or less than a humbug. And thus the cause is  injured.    For several years past, I have made some experiments in the rearing of  the silkworms, giving the result of my experience in the first year in  Vol. II., page 311, of the _American Naturalist_; and of a subsequent  year in the _Entomologist_, for November, 1869.    The paper in the _Naturalist_ is devoted to my experiments with the  ailanthus silkworm, _Samia Cynthia_ (G. & R.), a naturalized species  from the East. In that paper, I have said all that is necessary to  say at present, on that species, except perhaps that I am further  convinced, from the inspection of samples of sewing and other silks,  made from the cocoons of _Cynthia_, that one day it will be reared  very extensively in the United States. It is perfectly hardy, is  double brooded, and may be reared by any one possessed of a few acres  of land, which may be good enough for growing ailanthus trees, but  not good enough to grow any thing else. The labor of a few old men,  or women, or even children, is sufficient for the purpose. The cost is  therefore trifling.    The objection to the cultivation of _Cynthia_ is that the cocoon  cannot be reeled. But it can be carded, and if the Chinese can make  excellent silk goods from it, why cannot we? I suspect, too, that  _Cynthia_ silk can be worked in with cotton, or, perhaps, woolen  goods, adding to their beauty and durability (for it is indestructible  in wear), and thus open up branches of manufacture hitherto unknown.    For manufacturers of coarse goods, I have no doubt that the silk  from our native silk moths, _Cecropia_ and _Polyphemus_, may be used.  Indeed, I believe that M. Trouvelot is of opinion that _Polyphemus_  may fairly enter into competition with _Bombyx mori_, the ordinary  mulberry silkworm. The worm, however, is rather difficult to rear.    In reference, however, to _Bombyx mori_, it is well known that the  silk crop in France and Italy has been reduced greatly, and the price  of silk goods consequently enhanced, by prevalence of disease among  the worms. So much is this the case, that silk breeders have been  obliged to look around for some silk-producing moths whose products  may, at any rate, supplement the deficient crop. _Cynthia_, as already  mentioned as one of these, and two others mentioned by Warren in the  _Tribune_ reports above adverted to, are at present the subjects of  experiment.    My article mentioned before as appearing in the _American  Entomologist_ is mainly devoted to my experiments, and those of my  correspondents, with _Yamamai_, which, as I said before, is an oak  feeder. In Japan, which is its native country, it feeds, in its wild  state, on _Quercus serrata_. Whether that oak be found in America, I  do not know, but it is of little importance, as the worm will feed on  almost any species of oak, although I think that it prefers white oak.  The importance of acclimatizing new species of silk moths is of so  much prospective importance, that I shall devote the remainder of this  article to the consideration of whether _Yamamai_ and _Pernyi_ may not  be naturalized here. Any one, who happens to have the number of the  _Entomologist_ containing the article above alluded to, may find it  worth while to read it, but as many persons may not be able to obtain  that number, I will here repeat the substance of my remarks, adding as  much new matter as subsequent experience has afforded.    The silk from the _Yamamai_ being considered superior to that produced  by any other of the substitute silk moths, great efforts have been  made in Europe to acclimatize it; but, it must be confessed, hitherto  with but slight success. There are exceptions, however, particularly  among amateurs in Germany, sufficient to show that success is  possible. The Baron de Bretton raises about 27,000 cocoons annually.    In this country but little has been done, or attempted, and that  little has not been very successful.    The fact is, that _Yamamai_ is a difficult moth to rear in a country  like this, where in early spring the temperature"]]]
