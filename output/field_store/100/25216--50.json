[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#9)"],[1,"Muslim theology, technically called  'Ilm-i-Usul, may be introduced by a few remarks on the nature of  inspiration according to Islam, though that is not strictly speaking a  portion of this study.    There are two terms used to express different degrees of inspiration, Wahi  and Ilham. Wahi is the term applied to the inspiration of the Quran, and  implies that the very words are the words of God. It is divided into Wahi  Zahir (external inspiration), and Wahi Batin (internal inspiration). The  whole book was prepared in heaven. Muhammad, instructed by Gabriel, is  simply the medium through which the revelation of Wahi Zahir reaches man.  The Wahi Quran, _i.e._, the highest form of inspiration, always came to the  ear of the Prophet through the instrumentality of Gabriel. In Muhammadan  theology, this is the special work of Gabriel. Thus in the Traditions it is  related that he appeared to Adam twelve times, to Enoch four, to Noah  fifty, to Abraham forty-two, to Moses four hundred, to Jesus ten times, to  Muhammad twenty-four thousand times.    Ilham means the inspiration given to a saint or to a prophet when he,  though rightly guided, delivers the subject matter out of his own mind, and  is not a mere machine to reproduce the messages of Gabriel. There is a  lower form of Wahi Zahir, which is called Isharat-ul-Malak (literally,  \"sign of the Angel.\") This expresses what Muhammad meant when he said: \"The  Holy Ghost has entered into my heart.\" In other words, he received the  inspiration through {38} Gabriel, but not by word of mouth. This form of  inspiration is higher than that possessed by saints, and is usually applied  to the inspiration of the Traditions. This is denied by some, who say that  except when delivering the Quran Muhammad spoke by Ilham and not by Wahi.  The practical belief is, however, that the Traditions were Wahi  inspiration, and thus they come to be as authoritative as the Quran.  Sharastani speaks of \"the signs (sayings) of the Prophet which have the  marks of Wahi.\"[41] This opinion is said by some Muslim theologians to be  supported by the first verse of the fifty-third Sura, entitled the Star.  \"By the Star when it setteth; your companion Muhammad _erreth not_, nor is  he _led astray_, neither doth he _speak of his own will_. It is none other  than a revelation which hath been revealed to him.\" In any case the  inspiration of Muhammad is something quite different from the Christian  idea of inspiration, which is to Musalmans a very imperfect mode of  transmitting a revelation of God's will.    That there should be a human as well as a divine side to inspiration is an  idea not only foreign, but absolutely repugnant to Muhammadans. The Quran  is not a book of principles. It is a book of directions. The Quran  describes the revelation given to Moses thus:--\"We wrote for him upon the  tables a monition concerning every matter and said: 'Receive them thyself  with steadfastness, and command thy people to receive them for the  observance of its most goodly precepts.'\" (Sura vii. 142). It is such an  inspiration as this the Quran claims for itself. Muhammad's idea was that  it should be a complete and final code of directions in every matter for  all mankind. It is not the word of a prophet enlightened by God. It  proceeds immediately from God, and the word 'say' or 'speak' precedes, or  is understood to precede, every sentence. This to a Muslim is the highest  form of inspiration; this alone stamps a book as {39} divine. It is  acknowledged that the Injil--the Gospel--was given by Jesus; but as that,  too, according to Muslim belief, was brought down from heaven by the angel  Gabriel during the month of Ramazan, it is now asserted that it has been  lost, and that the four Gospels of the New Testament are simply Traditions  collected by the writers whose names they bear. Their value is, therefore,  that of the second foundation of the Islamic system.    The question next arises as to the exact way in which Gabriel made known  his message to Muhammad. The Mudarij-un-Nabuwat, a standard theological  work, gives some details on this point.[42] Though the Quran is all of God,  both as to matter and form, yet it was not all made known to the Prophet in  one and the same manner. The following are some of the modes:--    1. It is recorded on the authority of 'Ayesha, one of Muhammad's wives,  that a brightness like the brightness of the morning came upon the Prophet.  According to some commentators this brightness remained six months. In some  mysterious way Gabriel, through this brightness or vision, made known the  will of God.    2. Gabriel appeared in the form of Dahiah, one of the Companions of the  Prophet, renowned for his beauty and gracefulness. A learned dispute has  arisen with regard to the abode of the soul of Gabriel when he assumed the  bodily form of Dahiah. At times, the angelic nature of Gabriel overcame  Muhammad, who was then translated to the world of angels. This always  happened when the revelation was one of bad news, such as denunciations or  predictions of woe. At other times, when the message brought by Gabriel was  one of consolation and comfort, the human nature of the Prophet overcame  the angelic nature of the angel, who, in such case, having assumed a human  form, proceeded to deliver the message. {40}    3. The Prophet heard at times the noise of the tinkling of a bell. To him  alone was known the meaning of the sound. He alone could distinguish in,  and through it, the words which Gabriel wished him to understand. The  effect of this mode of Wahi was more marvellous than that of any of the  other ways. When his ear caught the sound his whole frame became agitated.  On the coldest day, the perspiration, like beads of silver, would roll down  his face. The glorious brightness of his countenance gave place to a  ghastly hue, whilst the way in which he bent down his head showed the  intensity of the emotion through which he was passing. If riding, the camel  on which he sat would fall to the ground. The Prophet one day, when  reclining with his head in the lap of Zeid, heard the well known sound:  Zeid, too, knew that something unusual was happening, for so heavy became  the head of Muhammad that it was with the greatest difficulty he could  support the weight.    4. At the time of the Mi'raj, or night ascent into heaven, God spoke to the  Prophet without the intervention of an angel. It is a disputed point  whether the face of the Lord was veiled or not.    5. God sometimes appeared in a dream, and placing his hands on the  Prophet's shoulders made known his will.    6. Twice, angels having each six hundred wings, appeared and brought the  message from God.    7. Gabriel, though not appearing in bodily form, so inspired the heart of  the Prophet that the words he uttered under its influence were the words of  God. This is technically called Ilka, and is by some supposed to be the  degree of inspiration to which the Traditions belong.    Above all, the Prophet was not allowed to remain in any error; if, by any  chance, he had made a wrong deduction from any previous revelation, another  was always sent to rectify it. This idea has been worked up to a science of  abrogation, according to which some verses of the Quran abrogate others.  Muhammad found it necessary to shift {41} his stand-point more than once,  and thus it became necessary to annul earlier portions of his revelation.    Thus in various ways was the revelation made known to Muhammad. At first  there seems to have been a season of doubt (Ante p. 3), the dread lest  after all it might be a mockery. But as years rolled on confidence in  himself and in his mission came. At times, too, there is a joyousness in  his utterances as he swears by heaven and earth, by God and man; but more  often the visions were weird and terrible. Tradition says:--\"He roared like  a camel, the sound as of bells well-nigh rent his heart in pieces.\" Some  strange power moved him, his fear was uncontrollable. For twenty years or  more the revelations came, a direction on things of heaven and of earth, to  the Prophet as the spiritual guide of all men,[43] to the Warrior-Chief, as  the founder of political unity among the Arab tribes.    A Muhammadan student, after passing through a course of instruction in  grammar, rhetoric, logic, law, and dogmatics, at length reaches the stage  when he is permitted to enter upon the study of \"'Ilm-i-usul,\" or the  exegesis of the Quran, and the inspired sayings of the Prophet. This done,  he can henceforth read the approved commentaries in order to learn what the  Fathers of Islam have to say. This science in one way fits him to be a  commentator, for the work of a Muslim divine now is, not to bring things  \"new and old\" out of the sacred book, but to hand down to others the things  old. There is no indwelling spirit in the Church of Islam which can reveal  to the devout mind new views of truth, or lead the pious scholar on to  deeper and more profound knowledge.    The greatest proficient in theology is the man who can repeat the Quran by  heart, who knows also and can reproduce at will what the early commentators  have said, who can remember, and quote in the most apposite manner, the  {42} Prophet's sayings preserved in the Traditions handed down by the  Companions, their followers, and their followers' followers, who can point  out a flaw in the Isnad (_i.e._ chain of narrators) of a Tradition quoted  by an opponent, or maintain, by repeating the long list of names, the  authority of the Isnad of the Tradition he quotes himself. A good memory,  not critical acumen, is the great desideratum in a Muslim theologian. The  chief qualification of a Hafiz, a man who can repeat the whole Quran by  heart, is not that he shall understand its meaning, but that he shall be  able to pronounce each word correctly. By men who are not Arabs by birth,  this is only to be attained after years of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#9)"],[1,"the vinous process of fermentation, which  every one concerned in the process is presumed to be acquainted with,  is either composed of hydrogen and oxygen, or is a composition of  carbon and oxygen, on which philosophers are divided in opinion. As the  result is the same with respect to the formation of wine, beer, and  spirit, I shall enter into no controversial reasoning on this head,  instead of which, I shall endeavour to point out the most effectual  mode of saving and profitably applying it, and the other elements, in  the composition of wine, beer, spirit, and acid.    As in fermentation, spontaneous or excited, there is a sensible escape  of carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, it may not be improper to note,  that fermentable, or saccharine matter, consists of about twenty-eight  pounds of carbon, eight pounds of hydrogen, and sixty-four pounds of  oxygen, reducible into fixed, inflammable, and vital air, weighing one  hundred subtile pounds in toto, or that every one hundred subtile  pounds of saccharine matter consists of such proportions of these airs  and gasses.    Attenuation is the result of a due resolution of the fermentable matter  produced by excited fermentation, which divides mucilages, resolves  viscidities, breaks down cohesions, generates heat and motion,  extricates the imprisoned gasses, and, by frequent commixture, promotes  the action and re-action of the component particles on each other, and  by continually exposing a fresh surface and opposition of matter,  brings them within the sphere of each other's attraction.    As their original attraction is weakened by heat and motion, their  expansion is increased by repulsion; and as they revolve, and recede  from each other in this way, they are fitted, by the change in their  modification, to involve each other, and from new attractions combining  with each other into new substances, according to affinity, under  changes induced in their nature conducive to this end, which not being  exactly known, cannot at present be fully defined. In every brewing, or  preparation of saccharine fluid for fermentation, the following  phenomena occur: first, _heat_ is either disengaged or fixed: secondly,  an _elastic fluid_ is either formed or absorbed in a nascent state:  these two indisputable facts form the uniform and invariable phenomena  of fermentation, and may be admitted as an established _axiom_, that  the proportions, extrication, and action of heat, with the fermentation  and fixation of elastic fluids, during the process, are the foundation  of the vinous products of the fermenting fluid. In conformity to so  rational a theory, I have for many years regulated my practice, the  result of which is the object of these papers. These, therefore, are  the three great objects which should engage our attention; not only  in fermentation, but in every similar process in chemistry, and are  the fundamental principles of our doctrine. FERMENTATION being not  only a decomposition of the fermentable matter, but of the water of  the fluid also; and the fixed air formed during the process being  composed of the hydrogen and oxygen of the fermentable matter, and  the water of the fluid also, there is a perpetual decomposition and  recomposition of that water, which gives fluidity to the whole mass,  taking place during the continuance of the process, part of the  hydrogen and oxygen of which escapes under the form of fixed air, for  want of a proper substance being presented of affinity enough to  absorb and combine with it into wine, beer, or spirit, or some other  necessary assistance in heat, light, motion, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon,  &c. or an intermedium to facilitate the formation of wine, beer, or  spirit, in preference to fixed air. Fixed air, or carbonic acid gas,  consists of about twenty-five parts of oxygen, and nine of carbon,  devested of the mucilage and yest that rises with it. It should be  recollected, that the decomposition of pyrites, the formation of  nitre, respiration, fermentation, &c. are low degrees of combustion,  and though it is the property of combustion to form fixed and  phlogisticated airs, both the modes of doing it, and the quantity of  the products, depend on the manner of oxygenating them in the changes  brought about by the different modes of combustion, or fermentation in  the vinous, acetous, and putrid process, which show the affinity  between them.    Fermentation is a subsequent _low combustion_ of the vegetable oxydes  or grain, that has undergone a previous, but partial combustion,  something like the slightly charring, or oxydating of wood or  pit-coal, by which the oxygenation is incomplete in both, and rendered  more complete in the former. An ultimate combustion of the fermentable  matter employed, is found only in the putrid process of fermentation,  which is a final or total decomposition of vegetable and animal  substances, in the actual combustion or burning of wood, charcoal, or  bones.    In the vinous process we have seen the escape of carbonic acid gas; in  the acetous process there is a great escape of azotic gas, or  phlogisticated air, from the decomposition of the air of the atmosphere  consumed in this process, which consists of about two-thirds of azotic  gas, and one third of oxygen gas,[3] the oxygenous part being absorbed  in the acetous process, and azotic set free with more or less hydrogen  and acetic gas, proportioned to the existing heat. If the heat is  beyond a certain degree, a portion of the ethereal part of the  new-formed acid escapes also.          [3] Twenty-seven parts of oxygen gas, and seventy-three of azotic        gas.    In the putrid process, the hydrogen escapes under the acriform shape of  inflammable air and azotic gas, and nothing more remains than mere  earth or water, or both, as the case may be, which is exactly similar  to other combustions, of which nothing remains, (if we except  phosphorus) but earth or ashes, with what small portion of alkaline or  other salts they may contain. This alkaline matter being present during  the formation of carbonic and azotic gas, absorbs, to saturation, a due  proportion of them, and generates _tartar_.    Experience has taught us the truth or justness of this definition, and  though it has brought us acquainted with the results of those three  stages of fermentation, combustion, or decomposition, we have certainly  overlooked the means of applying them with all the advantage they admit  of in the business which is the subject of these papers, and which a  little time and close observation must convince us of; and how much has  been hitherto lost, with the means of saving it in future, shall be  presently explained, and particularly pointed out.    In the prosecution of this design, where I may not be able to give an  unexceptionable demonstration, I hope always to be provided with a  practical proof, which may prove equally beneficial.    Let us now see what passes in a state of low combustion, such as may be  the result of fermentation in vegetables, arising from heat, moisture,  and motion, when impacted together. The most obvious occurrence of this  nature is found in new hay, which, under these circumstances, for want  of care and attention, often spontaneously takes fire, particularly in  wet seasons.    Fermentation, being one of the lowest degrees of combustion, is here  the spontaneous effect of the moist hay being impacted together, and  not properly made, that is, without the superfluous juices being dried  out of it, by which it retains a sufficient degree of fluidity or  moisture to begin a fermentation, in which heat and motion are  generated, and light, in a nascent state, extricated; these appearances  accumulated and accelerated by incumbent pressure, the redundant  moisture being soon exhausted, and the heat and motion increasing, the  actual combustion of the mass takes place, which is much facilitated by  a decomposition of the water of this moisture, and the air of the  atmosphere, unavoidably insinuated between the interstices formed by  the fibres of the hay, as they are impacted together into cocks, or  stacks, breaks out into actual flame, or _light visible_. These are no  novel appearances, but such as fall within the observation of every  one; and the candid maltster will acknowledge, that from the same  cause, though differently produced, similar effects may, and sometimes  do, happen in the malt house, in the preparation of that modern  article of luxury, by which we are enabled to make malt wine; and  these instances are sufficient to prove fermentation to be a low  degree of combustion, and to both simplify and explain the justness of  this doctrine. The malting of corn is the first stage of vegetation,  low combustion, and fermentation.    From observation and reasoning on what passes before our eyes, we  discover the low species of fermentation, in which the malting of corn  consists, to be a low degree of combustion, which, for want of due  attention, may break out into actual flame. We were always acquainted  with the _effect_: now reasoning on the subject brings us to a  knowledge of the cause.    To any one well acquainted with the nature of fermentation, it must be  manifest, that the malt distillers have paid more attention, and made  greater progress in the improvement of the process than any other class  of men interested in the success, though far from having arrived at  their _ne plus ultra_.    The introduction of raw or unmalted corn; the close compactness of  their working tun, or fermenting backs; the order and progressive  succession with which they conduct the process; and the pains they  necessarily take to arrive at a perfect attenuation, by a long  protracted fermentation, with the early conviction of a reward  proportioned to their diligence, and the success attending their best  endeavours, when not frustrated by intervening causes, must be stronger  inducements"]]]
