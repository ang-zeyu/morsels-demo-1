He even gambled away the \"Stradivarius\" that had been presented to him,  and when his money, watch and jewels were gone, his new-found friends of  course decamped, and this gave the young man time to ponder on the  vanities of life.    When he played again it was on a borrowed \"Guarnerius,\" and after the  rich owner, himself a violinist, had heard him play, he said, \"No  fingers but yours shall ever play that violin again!\"    Paganini accepted the gift, and this was the violin he played for full  forty years, and which, on his death, was willed to his native city of  Genoa. There it can be seen in its sealed-up glass case.    Up to his thirtieth year Paganini continued his severe work of subduing  the violin. By that time he had sounded its possibilities, and  thereafter no one heard him play except in concert. It is told that one  man, anxious to know the secrets of Paganini's power, followed him from  city to city, watching him at his concerts, dogging him through the  streets, spying upon him at hotels. At one inn this man of curiosity had  the felicity to secure a room next to the one occupied by Paganini; and  one morning as he watched through the keyhole, he was rewarded by seeing  the master open the case where reposed the precious \"Guarnerius.\"  Paganini lifted the instrument, held it under his chin, took up the bow  and made a few passes in the air--not a sound was heard. Then he kissed  the back of the violin, muttered a prayer, and locked the instrument in  its case.    At concert rehearsals he always played a mute instrument; and Harris,  his manager, records that for the many years he was with Paganini he  never heard him play a single note except before an audience.    I have a full-length daguerreotype of Paganini taken when he was forty  years of age. No one ever asked this man, \"Kind sir, are you anybody in  particular?\"    Paganini was tall and wofully slim. His hands and feet were large and  bony, his arms long, his form bowed and lacking in all that we call  symmetry. But the long face with its look of abject melancholy, the  curved nose, the thin lips and the sharp, protruding chin, made a  combination that Fate has never duplicated. You could easily believe  that this man knew all the secrets of the Nether World, and had tasted  the joys of Paradise as well. Women pitied and loved him, men feared  him, and none understood him. He lived in the midst of throngs and  multitudes--the loneliest man known in the history of art.    Paganini, when he had reached his height, played only his own music; he  played divinely and incomprehensibly; next to his passion for music was  his greed for gold. These three facts sum up all we really know about  the master--the rest fades off into mist--mystery, fable and legend. We  do know, however, that he composed several pieces of music so difficult  that he could not play them himself, and of course no one else can.  Imagination can always outrun performance. Paganini had no close  friends; no confidants: he never mingled in society, and he never  married.    At times he would disappear from the public gaze for several months,  and not even his business associates knew where he was. On one such  occasion a traveler discovered him in a monastic retreat in the Swiss  Mountains, wearing a horsehair robe and a rope girdle; others saw him  disguised as a mendicant; and still another tells of finding him working  as a day-laborer with obscure and ignorant peasants. Then there are  tales told of how he was taken captive by a titled lady of great wealth  and beauty, who carried him away to her bower, where he eschewed the  violin and tinkled only the guitar the livelong day.    Everywhere the report was current that Paganini had killed a man, and  been sentenced to prison for life. The story ran that in prison he found  an old violin, three strings of which were broken, and so he played on  one string, producing such ravishing music that the keepers feared he  was \"possessed.\" They decided they must get rid of him, and so contrived  to have him thrown overboard from a galley; but he swam ashore, and  although he was everywhere known, no man dared place a hand on him.    A late writer in a London magazine, however, has given evidence of being  a psychologist and man of sense; he says, and produces proof, that after  the concert season was over Paganini withdrew to a monastery in the  mountains of Switzerland, and there the monks who loved him well,  guarded his retreat. There he found the rest for which his soul craved,  and there he practised on his violin hour after hour, day after day.  All this is better understood when we remember that after each retreat,  Paganini appeared with brand-new effects which electrified his  hearers--\"effects taught him by the devil.\"    Constant appearing before vast multitudes and ceaseless travel create a  depletion that demands rest. Paganini held the balance true by fleeing  to the mountains; there he worked and prayed. That Paganini had a soft  heart, in spite of the silent, cold and melancholy mood that usually  possessed him, is shown in his treatment of his father and mother, who  lived to know the greatness of their son. He wrote his mother kind and  affectionate letters, some of which we have, and provided lavishly for  every want of both his parents. At times he gave concerts for charity,  and on these occasions vast sums were realized.    Paganini died in Eighteen Hundred Forty, aged fifty-six years. His will  provided for legacies to various men and women who had befriended him,  and he also gave to others with whom he had quarreled, thus proving he  was not all clay.    The bulk of his fortune, equal to half a million dollars, was bequeathed  to his son, Baron Achille Paganini. And as if mystery should still  enshroud his memory and this, true to his nature, should be carried out  in his last will, there are those who maintain that Achille Paganini was  not his son at all--only a waif he had adopted. Yet Achille always  stoutly maintained the distinction--but what boots it, since he could  not play his father's violin?    Yet this we know--Paganini, the man of mystery and moods, once lived and  produced music that, Orpheus-like, transfixed the world. We are better  for his having been and this world is a nobler place in that he lived  and played, for listen closely and you can hear, even now, the sweet,  sad echoes of those vibrant strings, touched by the hand of him who  loved them well.    And when we remember the prodigious amount of practise that Paganini  schooled himself to in youth; and join this to the recently discovered  record of his long monastic retreats, when for months he worked and  played and prayed, we can guess the secret of his power. If you wish me  to present you a recipe for doing a deathless performance, I would give  you this: Work, travel, solitude, prayer, and yet again--work.          [Illustration: FREDERIC CHOPIN]    FREDERIC CHOPIN           Nature does not design like art, however realistic she may be. She       has caprices, inconsequences, probably not real, but very       mysterious. Art only rectifies these inconsequences, because it is       too limited to reproduce them. Chopin was a resume of these       inconsequences which God alone can allow Himself to create, and       which have their particular logic. He was modest on principle,       gentle by habit, but he was imperious by instinct and full of a       legitimate pride which was unconscious of itself. Hence arose       sufferings which he did not reason and which did not fix themselves       on a determined object.         --_George Sand in \"The Story of My Life\"_      FREDERIC CHOPIN    Maybe I am all wrong about it, yet I can not help believing that the  spirit of man will live again somewhere in a better world than ours.  Fenelon says, \"Justice demands another life in order to make good the  inequalities of this.\" Astronomers prophesy the existence of stars long  before they can see them. They know where they ought to be, and training  their telescopes in that direction they wait, knowing they will find.    Materially, no one can imagine anything more beautiful than this earth,  for the simple reason that we can not imagine anything we have not seen;  we may make new combinations, but the whole is all made up of parts of  things with which we are familiar. This great green earth out of which  we have sprung, of which we are a part, that supports our bodies, and to  which our bodies must return to repay the loan, is very, very beautiful.    But the spirit of man is not fully at home here; as we grow in soul and  intellect, we hear, and hear again, a voice which says, \"Arise and get  thee hence, for this is not thy rest.\" And the greater and nobler and  more sublime the spirit, the more constant the discontent. Discontent  may come from various causes, so it will not do to assume that the  discontented are always the pure in heart, but it is a fact that the  wise and excellent have all known the meaning of world-weariness. The  more you study and appreciate this life, the more sure you are that this  is not all. You pillow your head upon Mother Earth, listen to her  heart-throb, and even as your spirit is filled with the love of her,  your gladness is half-pain and there comes to you a joy that hurts.    To look upon the most exalted forms of beauty, such as a sunset at sea,  the coming of a storm on the prairie, the shadowy silence of the desert,  or the sublime majesty of the mountains, begets a sense of sadness, an  increasing loneliness.    It is not enough to say that man encroaches on man so that we are really  deprived of our freedom, that civilization is caused by a bacillus, and  that from a natural condition we have gotten into a hurly-burly where  rivalry is rife--all this may be true, but beyond and outside of all  this there is no physical environment in way of plenty which earth can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#9)"],[1," with an epitaph  written by himself at eighty years of age. By the next pillar is the  monument of Bishop Hoadley, with a good medallion-portrait of him on it.    On the south side of the nave we find two remarkable tombs, of which the  first is the #Chantry of William of Wykeham#, called by Timbs \"one of  the best remaining specimens of a fourteenth century monument.\" It  stands, where Wykeham erected it, \"in that part of the cross (formed by  the church) which corresponds to the Saviour's pierced side,\" and  occupies the space between the piers which enclose the fifth bay from  the west end. The site is said to have been previously occupied by an  altar dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, Wykeham's patroness. He left  directions, moreover, that three monks should celebrate masses thrice  daily in his chantry, receiving for this one penny a day, while the boys  who were to sing there nightly were assigned 6s. 8d. a year. Needless to  say, his wishes are not now carried out. The stone-screen which  surrounds the chantry is of beautiful and elaborate workmanship, the  effect of which has been compared to lace, while above graceful shafts  support a canopy, of which the pinnacles rise to the level of the  triforium gallery. At the east end are traces of an altar and credence  table, and close by is a piscina. Above are two rows of canopied niches,  which, however they were originally occupied, have for long been  untenanted until quite recently. During the early part of 1897 the  pedestals have been filled with ten statue of modern workmanship.[2] A  row of five empty niches runs along the western wall. The vault of the  chantry is richly groined with lierne work; it is tinted a vivid blue on  the back-ground, and the bosses on the groins are gilt. The ironwork in  this chantry is also noticeable. The tomb within has fortunately  suffered but little from time, and, thanks to the courage of one of the  pupils in Wykeham's foundation at Winchester, Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes,  the Parliamentarians left both this monument and the college buildings  untouched. On the tomb itself lies the figure of Wykeham with his hands  folded across his breast, habited in Episcopal robes and mitre, his  crozier on his shoulder. Three small figures of monks praying kneel at  his feet, while his head is slightly raised up by supporting angels. A  little arcade runs all round the tomb, with a series of shields in the  spaces, containing his arms and motto \"Manners Makyth Man\" and the arms  of the see of Winchester. His epitaph, on a slip of red enamelled brass  in a chamfer round the edge of the tomb, has been thus translated:--        Here, overthrown by death, lies William, surnamed Wykeham.      He was Bishop of this Church, which he repaired.      He was unbounded in hospitality, as the rich and poor alike can prove.      He was also an able politician, and a counsellor of the State.      By the colleges which he founded his piety is made known;      The first of which is at Oxford and the second at Winchester.      You, who behold this tomb, cease not to pray      That, for such great merits, he may enjoy everlasting life.       [2] \"One method of commemorating the Quincentenary of Winchester         College (1893) was the insertion of statues into the niches of         the Founder's Chantry in the Cathedral. The work was done by Mr         Frampton, A.R.A., under the direction of Mr Micklethwaite. The         subjects are the Virgin and Child, with Angels; William of         Wykeham, presenting a scholar of Winchester; and a Warden of New         College, presenting a scholar of that college (the artist worked         with a photograph of the present Warden before him); the Pastor         Bonus with SS. James and John; SS. Peter and Paul. The altar and         fittings were presented by Colonel Shaw Hellier; the cross being         inscribed with the chronogram;--nVnC gLorIa In eXCeLsIs Deo et In         terra paX hoMInIbVS bonae VoLVntatIs\" (_The Church Times_, Aug.         20, 1897).    [Illustration: WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM'S CHANTRY.  From Britton's \"Winchester.\"]    As one proceeds along the nave toward the east, the choir is reached by  two flights of four steps each with a landing between, over which  formerly there extended a rood-loft from pillar to pillar, bearing on it  Stigand's great cross. To the south of these choir steps and adjoining  the intermediate landing is the #Chantry of Bishop Edingdon#, the  earliest in date of the chapel-tombs at Winchester. The chantry is very  plain in comparison with the others in the cathedral, and apart from the  tomb there is only a slightly raised platform at the east end, without  an altar. A shaft of the large pillars runs down the centre of the east  and west interior walls. On the tomb lies the figure of the Bishop _in  pontificalibus_, his stole bearing the symbolic and much-disputed  \"Fylfot\" cross, which has been interpreted as a sign of submission.  Edingdon's curious Latin epitaph, given on page 107, is on a blue  enamelled strip of brass on the edge of the tomb.    Close to Edingdon's chantry is the #Nave Pulpit#, which is in itself a  good piece of Jacobean work, though not happily situated in the nave of  Winchester. It stood formerly in the chapel at New College, Oxford, and  did not appear at Winchester until 1884, when it was presented by  members of the Mayo family. If one stands facing east in the aisle to  the right of this pulpit, one of the most picturesque views in the  cathedral lies before one, through part of the south transept and up the  southern ambulatory of the retro-choir to the bright colours of  Langton's chapel window at the end. It will readily be noticed how out  of the perpendicular are the piers of this ambulatory as one approaches  the east end of the church. This seems to have arisen through a slight  subsidence of the ground here.    The original rood-screen exists no longer, and in its place we have but  a modern copy, by Sir Gilbert Scott, of the work in the Decorated choir  stall canopies. This oak #Choir Screen#, which is all that breaks the  view between west porch and reredos, has not met with much approval, and  the pallor of its wood does not contrast agreeably with the rich colour  of the old choir stalls. This, however, cannot with justice be made a  ground for complaint against the architect, who modelled his work as far  as possible on the original.    As one enters the #Choir#, which is raised above the level of the nave  by the two sets of four steps, the stalls above-mentioned will be found  to reach on either side from the eastern piers of the central tower to  the first piers of the nave. They are of carved oak and are possibly the  best existing examples of their date in England. The style is Early  Decorated, and Willis points out the similarity between their canopies  and gables and those of Edward Crouchback's chapel in Westminster Abbey.  The details are varied and graceful, with the design of each pair  coupled under a pointed arch with a cinquefoil in its head, which is  again surmounted by a high crocketted gable. The oak has turned a superb  hue with age, very different from the colour of the modern screen which  is banked by the reveals of the old bishop's throne. The _misereres_  below are much earlier in date than the canopies, but do not go quite so  far back as those at Exeter, which may be assigned to about 1230. The  desks and stools of the upper tier show the date 1540 and bear also the  initials of Henry VIII., Bishop Gardiner, and Dean Kingsmill. The pulpit  on the north side of the choir was given by Prior Silkstede, whose name  it bears, and is also of finely carved work. Above the choir stalls on  the northern side is the organ, which was repaired this year.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING EAST. _H.W. Salmon, Photo._]    Toward the east end of the choir stalls, in the centre of the pavement,  lies the much-disputed #Tomb of William Rufus#. It is a plain coped  tomb, constructed of Purbeck marble. Since it was known that William was  buried originally beneath the tower, this tomb was assumed to be his,  and in Cromwell's time it was violated, when, as Milner relates, there  was found therein, \"besides the dust, some pieces of cloth embroidered  with gold, a large gold ring, and a small silver chalice.\" The very fact  of these discoveries, however, tend to prove that the grave was not that  of Rufus. It is now frequently held that it is that of Henry of Blois,  who is known to have been buried \"with much honour before the high  altar\"; Rudborne records that he was _sepultus in ecclesia sua coram  summo altari_. Yet others suppose that he still lies in the space  _before_ the altar. The ring found in Cromwell's time, set with a  sapphire which denotes a bishop, may be seen in the cathedral library.  When the contents of the tomb were last examined, on August 27, 1868,  the remains, though much disturbed by the previous violation, indicated  a man of about 5 feet 8 inches, and fragments of red cloth with gold  embroidery were to be seen. It was also gathered that the body had been  wrapped in lead, as Henry of Blois was said to have been.    The vaulting of the presbytery, which is of timber carved to imitate  stone, is remarkable for its very fine and brilliantly coloured bosses,  forming a quite unique collection of designs. Milner mentions as the  chief among these, \"the arms and badges of the families of Lancaster and  Tudor, the arms of Castile, of Cardinal Beaufort, and even of the very  sees held successively by Bishop Fox. The part of the vaulting from the  altar to the east window bears none but pious ornaments: the several  instruments of the Saviour's Passion, including S. Peter's denial, and  the betrayal in the Garden of Gethsemane, the faces of Pilate and his  wife, of the Jewish high priest, Judas kissing Jesus, Judas' money-bag,  the Veronica\"--this is immediately above the place of the"]]]
