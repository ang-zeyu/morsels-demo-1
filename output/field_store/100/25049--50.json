[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#9)"],[1," I'm about! He was a  sweet little, precious little, pretty little puppy, so he was.\"    Rose-Red marched into the court with the puppy, opened a gate and  dropped him inside.    \"That pup belongs to me, now,\" she said marching back.    The school bell ringing at this moment ended the scene.    \"Who's that little girl who wears the scarlet cape?\" Maida asked  Dorothy and Mabel Clark when they came in together at four.    \"Rosie Brine,\" they answered in chorus.    \"She's a dreffle naughty girl,\" Mabel said in a whisper, and \"My  mommer won't let me play with her,\" Dorothy added.    \"Why not?\" Maida asked.    \"She's a tom-boy,\" Mabel informed her.    \"What's a tom-boy?\" Maida asked Billy that night at dinner.    \"A tom-boy?\" Billy repeated. \"Why, a tom-boy is a girl who acts like  a boy.\"    \"How can a girl be a boy?\" Maida queried after a few moments of  thought. \"Why don't they call her a tom-girl?\"    \"Why, indeed?\" Billy answered, taking up the dictionary.    Certainly Rosie Brine acted like a boy--Maida proved that to herself  in the next few days when she watched Rose-Red again and again. But  if she were a tom-boy, she was also, Maida decided, the most  beautiful and the most wonderful little girl in the world. And,  indeed, Rosie was so full of energy that it seemed to spurt out in  the continual sparkle of her face and the continual movement of her  body. She never walked. She always crossed the street in a series of  flying jumps. She never went through a gate if she could go over the  fence, never climbed the fence if she could vault it. The scarlet  cape was always flashing up trees, over sheds, sometimes to the very  roofs of the houses. Her principal diversion seemed to be climbing  lamp-posts. Maida watched this proceeding with envy. One athletic  leap and Rose-Red was clasping the iron column half-way up--a few  more and she was swinging from the bars under the lantern. But she  was accomplished in other ways. She could spin tops, play \"cat\" and  \"shinney\" as well as any of the boys. And as for jumping rope--if two  little girls would swing for her, Rosie could actually waltz in the  rope.    The strangest thing about Rosie was that she did not always go to  school like the other children. The incident of the dog happened on  Thursday. Friday morning, when the children filed into the  schoolhouse, Rosie did not follow them. Instead, she hid herself in  a doorway until after the bell rang. A little later she sneaked out  of her hiding place, joined Arthur Duncan at the corner, and  disappeared into the distance. Just before twelve they both came  back. For a few moments, they kept well concealed on a side street,  out of sight of Primrose Court. But, at intervals, Rosie or Arthur  would dart out to a spot where, without being seen, they could get a  glimpse of the church clock. When the children came out of school at  twelve, they joined the crowd and sauntered home.    Monday morning Maida saw them repeat these maneuvers. She was  completely mystified by them and yet she had an uncomfortable  feeling. They were so stealthy that she could not help guessing that  something underhand was going on.    \"Do you know Rosie Brine?\" Maida asked Dicky Dore one evening when  they were reading together.    \"Sure!\" Dicky's face lighted up. \"Isn't she a peach?\"    \"They say she is a tom-boy,\" Maida objected. \"Is she?\"    \"Surest thing you know,\" Dicky said cheerfully. \"She won't take a  dare. You ought to see her playing stumps. There's nothing a boy can  do that she won't do. And have you noticed how she can spin a  top--the best I ever saw for a girl.\"    Then boys liked girls to be tom-boys. This was a great surprise.    \"How does it happen that she doesn't go to school often?\"    Dicky grinned. \"Hooking jack!\"    \"Hooking jack?\" Maida repeated in a puzzled tone.    \"Hooking jack--playing hookey--playing truant.\" Dicky watched Maida's  face but her expression was still puzzled. \"Pretending to go to  school and not going,\" he said at last.    \"Oh,\" Maida said. \"I understand now.\"    \"She just hates school,\" Dicky went on. \"They can't make her go. Old  Stoopendale, the truant officer, is always after her. Little she  cares for old Stoopy though. She gets fierce beatings for it at  home, too. Funny thing about Rosie--she won't tell a lie. And when  her mother asks her about it, she always tells the truth. Sometimes  her mother will go to the schoolhouse door with her every morning  and afternoon for a week. But the moment she stops, Rosie begins to  hook jack again.\"    \"Mercy me!\" Maida said. In all her short life she had never heard  anything like this. She was convinced that Rosie Brine was a very  naughty little girl. And yet, underneath this conviction, burned an  ardent admiration for her.    \"She must be very brave,\" she said soberly.    \"Brave! Well, I guess you'd think so! Arthur Duncan says she's  braver than a lot of boys he knows. Arthur and she hook jack  together sometimes. And, oh cracky, don't they have the good times!  They go down to the Navy Yard and over to the Monument Grounds.  Sometimes they go over to Boston Common and the Public Garden. Once  they walked all the way to Franklin Park. And in the summer they  often walk down to Crescent Beach. They say when I get well, I can  go with them.\"    Dicky spoke in the wistful tone with which he always related the  deeds of stronger children. Maida knew exactly how he felt--she had  been torn by the same hopes and despairs.    \"Oh, wouldn't it be grand to be able to do just anything?\" she said.  \"I'm just beginning to feel as if I could do some of the things I've  always wanted to do.\"    \"I'm going to do them all, sometime,\" Dicky prophesied. \"Doc O'Brien  says so.\"    \"I think Rosie the beautifullest little girl,\" Maida said. \"I wish  she'd come into the shop so that I could get acquainted with her.\"    \"Oh, she'll come in sometime. You see the W.M.N.T. is meeting now  and we're all pretty busy. She's the only girl in it.\"    \"The W.M.N.T.,\" Maida repeated. \"What does that mean?\"    \"I can't tell?\" Dicky said regretfully. \"It's the name of our club.  Rosie and Arthur and I are the only ones who belong.\"    After that talk, Maida watched Rosie Brine closer than ever. If she  caught a glimpse of the scarlet cape in the distance, it was hard to  go on working. She noticed that Rosie seemed very fond of all  helpless things. She was always wheeling out the babies in the  neighborhood, always feeding the doves and carrying her kitten about  on her shoulder, always winning the hearts of other people's dogs  and then trying to induce them not to follow her.    \"It seems strange that she never comes into the shop,\" Maida said  mournfully to Dicky one day.    \"You see she never has any money to spend,\" Dicky explained. \"That's  the way her mother punishes her. But sometimes she earns it on the  sly taking care of babies. She loves babies and babies always love  her. Delia'll go to her from my mother any time and as for Betsy  Hale--Rosie's the only one who can do anything with her.\"    But a whole week passed. And then one day, to Maida's great delight,  the tinkle of the bell preceded the entrance of Rose-Red.    \"Let me look at your tops, please,\" Rosie said, marching to the  counter with the usual proud swing of her body.    Seen closer, she was even prettier than at a distance. Her smooth  olive skin glistened like satin. Her lips showed roses even more  brilliant than those that bloomed in her cheeks. A frown between her  eyebrows gave her face almost a sullen look. But to offset this, her  white teeth turned her smile into a flash of light. Maida lifted all  the tops from the window and placed them on the counter.    \"Mind if I try them?\" Rosie asked.    \"Oh, do.\"    Rosie wound one of them with an expert hand. Then with a quick dash  forward of her whole arm, she threw the top to the floor. It danced  there, humming like a whole hiveful of bees.    \"Oh, how lovely!\" Maida exclaimed. Then in fervent admiration: \"What  a wonderful girl you are!\"    Rosie smiled. \"Easy as pie if you know how. Want to learn?\"    \"Oh, will you teach me?\"    \"Sure! Begin now.\"    Maida limped from behind the counter. Rosie watched her. Rosie's  face softened with the same pity that had shone on the frightened  little dog.    \"She's sorry for me,\" Maida thought. \"How sweet she looks!\"    But Rosie said nothing about Maida's limp. She explained the process  of top-spinning from end to end, step by step, making Maida copy  everything that she did. At first Maida was too eager--her hands  actually trembled. But gradually she gained in confidence. At last  she succeeded in making one top spin feebly.    \"Now you've got the hang of it,\" Rosie encouraged her, \"You'll soon  learn. All you want to do is to practice. I'll come to-morrow and  see how you're getting on.\"    \"Oh, do,\" Maida begged, \"and come to see me in the evening sometime.  Come this evening if your mother'll let you.\"    Rosie laughed scornfully. \"I guess nobody's got anything to say  about _letting me_, if I make up my mind to come. Well, goodbye!\"    She whirled out of the shop and soon the scarlet cape was a  brilliant spot in the distance.    But about seven that evening the bell rang. When Maida opened the  door there stood Rosie.    \"Oh, Rosie,\" Maida said joyfully, throwing her arms about her guest,  \"how glad I am to see you!\" She hurried her into the living-room  where Billy Potter was talking with Granny. \"This is Rosie Brine,  Billy,\" she said, her voice full of pride in her new friend. \"And  this is Billy Potter, Rosie.\"    Billy shook hands gravely with the little girl. And Rosie looked at  him in open wonder. Maida knew exactly what she was thinking. Rosie  was trying to make up her mind whether he was a boy or a man. The  problem seemed to grow more perplexing as the evening went on. For  part of the time Billy played with them, sitting on the floor like a  boy, and part of the time he talked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#9)"],[1,"to recognize us. One gondola  in the dark is pretty much like another, and however many enemies I  had, I should not be afraid of traversing the canals.\"    The next morning, at breakfast time, Francis related to his father his  adventure of the previous evening.    \"It is a mistake, my son, to mix yourself up in broils which do not  concern you; but in the present instance it may be that your adventure  will turn out to be advantageous to your prospects. Signor Polani is  one of the most illustrious merchants of Venice. His name is known  everywhere in the East, and there is not a port in the Levant where his  galleys do not trade. The friendship of such a man cannot but be most  useful to me.    \"Upon the other hand, you will probably make some enemies by your  interference with the plans of some unscrupulous young noble, and  Venice is not a healthy city for those who have powerful enemies; still  I think that the advantages will more than balance the risk.    \"However, Francis, you must curb your spirit of adventure. You are not  the son of a baron or count, and the winning of honour and glory by  deeds of arms neither befits you, nor would be of advantage to you in  any way. A trader of the city of London should be distinguished for his  probity and his attention to business; and methinks that, ere long, it  will be well to send you home to take your place in the counting house  under the eye of my partner, John Pearson.    \"Hitherto I have not checked your love for arms, or your intercourse  with youths of far higher rank than your own; but I have been for some  time doubting the wisdom of my course in bringing you out here with me,  and have regretted that I did not leave you in good hands at home. The  events of last night show that the time is fast approaching when you  can no longer be considered a boy, and it will be better for you to  turn at once into the groove in which you are to travel, than to  continue a mode of life which will unfit you for the career of a city  trader.\"    Francis knew too well his duty towards his father to make any reply,  but his heart sank at the prospect of settling down in the  establishment in London. His life there had not been an unpleasant one,  but he knew that he should find it terribly dull, after the freedom and  liberty he had enjoyed in Venice. He had never, however, even to  himself, indulged the idea that any other career, save that of his  father, could be his; and had regarded it as a matter of course that,  some day, he would take his place in the shop in Cheapside.    Now that it was suddenly presented to him as something which would  shortly take place, a feeling of repugnance towards the life came over  him. Not that he dreamt for a moment of trying to induce his father to  allow him to seek some other calling. He had been always taught to  consider the position of a trader of good standing, of the city of  London, as one of the most desirable possible. The line between the  noble and the citizen was so strongly marked that no one thought of  overstepping it. The citizens of London were as proud of their position  and as tenacious of their rights as were the nobles themselves. They  were ready enough to take up arms to defend their privileges and to  resist oppression, whether it came from king or noble; but few indeed,  even of the wilder spirits of the city, ever thought of taking to arms  as a profession.    It was true that honour and rank were to be gained, by those who rode  in the train of great nobles to the wars, but the nobles drew their  following from their own estates, and not from among the dwellers in  the cities; and, although the bodies of men-at-arms and archers,  furnished by the city to the king in his wars, always did their duty  stoutly in the field, they had no opportunity of distinguishing  themselves singly. The deeds which attracted attention, and led to  honour and rank, were performed by the esquires and candidates for the  rank of knighthood, who rode behind the barons into the thick of the  French chivalry.    Therefore Francis Hammond had never thought of taking to the profession  of arms in his own country; though, when the news arrived in Venice of  desperate fighting at sea with the Genoese, he had thought, to himself,  that the most glorious thing in life must be to command a well-manned  galley, as she advanced to the encounter of an enemy superior in  numbers. He had never dreamed that such an aspiration could ever be  satisfied--it was merely one of the fancies in which lads so often  indulge.    Still, the thought that he was soon to return and take his place in the  shop in Chepe was exceedingly unpleasant to him.    Soon after breakfast the bell at the water gate rang loudly, and a  minute later the servant entered with the news that Signor Polani was  below, and begged an interview. Mr. Hammond at once went down to the  steps to receive his visitor, whom he saluted with all ceremony, and  conducted upstairs.    \"I am known to you by name, no doubt, Signor Hammond, as you are to  me,\" the Venetian said, when the first formal greetings were over. \"I  am not a man of ceremony, nor, I judge, are you; but even if I were,  the present is not an occasion for it. Your son has doubtless told you  of the inestimable service, which he rendered to me last night, by  saving my daughters, or rather my eldest daughter--for it was doubtless  she whom the villains sought--from being borne off by one of the worst  and most disreputable of the many bad and disreputable young men of  this city.\"    \"I am indeed glad, Signor Polani, that my son was able to be of service  to you. I have somewhat blamed myself that I have let him have his own  way so much, and permitted him to give himself up to exercises of arms,  more befitting the son of a warlike noble than of a peaceful trader;  but the quickness and boldness, which the mastery of arms gives, was  yesterday of service, and I no longer regret the time he has spent,  since it has enabled him to be of aid to the daughters of Signor  Polani.\"    \"A mastery of arms is always useful, whether a man be a peace-loving  citizen, or one who would carve his way to fame by means of his  weapons. We merchants of the Mediterranean might give up our trade, if  we were not prepared to defend our ships against the corsairs of  Barbary, and the pirates who haunt every inlet and islet of the Levant  now, as they have ever done since the days of Rome. Besides, it is the  duty of every citizen to defend his native city when attacked. And  lastly, there are the private enemies, that every man who rises but in  the smallest degree above his fellows is sure to create for himself.    \"Moreover, a training in arms, as you say, gives readiness and  quickness, it enables the mind to remain calm and steadfast amidst  dangers of all sorts, and, methinks, it adds not a little to a man's  dignity and self respect to know that he is equal, man to man, to any  with whom he may come in contact. Here in Venice we are all soldiers  and sailors, and your son will make no worse merchant, but rather the  better, for being able to wield sword and dagger.    \"Even now,\" he said with a smile, \"he has proved the advantage of his  training; for, though I say it not boastfully, Nicholas Polani has it  in his power to be of some use to his friends, and foremost among them  he will henceforward count your brave son, and, if you will permit him,  yourself.    \"But you will, I trust, excuse my paying you but a short visit this  morning, for I am on my way to lay a complaint before the council. I  have already been round to several of my friends, and Phillipo  Giustiniani and some six others, nearest related to me, will go with  me, being all aggrieved at this outrage to a family nearly connected. I  crave you to permit me to take your son with me, in order that he may  be at hand, if called upon, to say what he knows of the affair.\"    \"Assuredly it is his duty to go with you if you desire it; although I  own I am not sorry that he could see, as he tells me, no badge or  cognizance which would enable him to say aught which can lead to the  identification of those who would have abducted your daughter. It is  but too well known a fact that it is dangerous to make enemies in  Venice, for even the most powerful protection does not avail against  the stab of a dagger.\"    \"That is true enough,\" the merchant said. \"The frequency of  assassinations is a disgrace to our city; nor will it ever be put down  until some men of high rank are executed, and the seignory show that  they are as jealous of the lives of private citizens, as they are of  the honour and well being of the republic.\"    Francis gladly threw aside his books when he was told that Signor  Polani desired him to accompany him, and was soon seated by the side of  the merchant in his gondola.    \"How old are you, my friend?\" the merchant asked him, as the boat  threaded the mazes of the canals.    \"I am just sixteen, signor.\"    \"No more!\" the merchant said in surprise. \"I had taken you for  well-nigh two years older. I have but just come from the Palazzo  Giustiniani, and my young kinsman, Matteo, tells me that in the School  of Arms there are none of our young nobles who are your match with  rapier or battleaxe.\"    \"I fear, sir,\" Francis said modestly, \"that I have given up more time  to the study of arms than befits the son of a sober trader.\"    \"Not at all,\" the Venetian replied. \"We traders have to defend our  rights and our liberties, our goods and our ships, just as much as the  nobles have to defend their privileges and their castles. Here in  Venice there are no such distinctions of rank as there are elsewhere.  Certain families, distinguished among the rest by their long standing,  wealth, influence, or the services they have rendered to the state, are  of senatorial rank, and constitute our nobility; but there are no  titles among us. We are all"]]]
