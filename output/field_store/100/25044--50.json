Stir to dissolve sugar, bring to boil, cook until it forms soft  ball when tried in cold water, or 240 degrees Fahrenheit in candy  thermometer. Remove from the fire, pour on large well-greased meat  platter and let cool; then begin and knead with spatula or spoon until  creamy white--when stiff knead like dough, cover and set aside for  twenty-four hours. To use, melt in double boiler, adding flavoring  desired and just a tablespoon or two of boiling water to make a  consistency that will spread.      CHOCOLATE ICING    Place in bowl      One pound XXXX sugar,    Two tablespoons cornstarch,    One-half cup cocoa,    Sufficient boiling water to make mixture spread.    Beat until smooth, then add one tablespoon of melted butter and use.

ORANGE WATER ICING    Place in bowl      One pound XXXX sugar,    Two tablespoonfuls cornstarch,    Yolk of one egg,    One teaspoonful grated orange peel.    Sufficient hot orange juice to make a mixture which will spread. Beat  hard for a few minutes to make glassy.      MOLASSES CAKE    Place in a mixing bowl      One-half cup of syrup,    One-half cup of brown sugar,    Six tablespoons of shortening,    One egg.    Cream well and then add      One cup of seeded raisins,    Two and one-half cups of flour,    One-half teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in    One-quarter cup of cold water or milk,    One-quarter teaspoonful mace,    One-quarter teaspoonful cloves,    One-half teaspoonful ginger.    Work to a smooth dough and then roll on a slightly floured board and  cut. Brush the tops of the cakes with syrup and sprinkle with finely  chopped nuts. Bake for eight minutes in a moderate oven. This makes  about three dozen cakes.      WHITE MOUNTAIN ICING    Place in saucepan      Two cups of sugar,    One-half cup of corn syrup,    One-half cup of water.    Stir to dissolve sugar; bring to a boil, cook until mixture forms soft  ball, then pour in fine stream upon stiffly beaten white of egg. Beat  to blend and use while warm.      DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE      One cupful of sugar,    Six tablespoonfuls of shortening.    Cream well and then add      Yolk of one egg,    One whole egg,    Three-quarter cupful of milk,    Two cupfuls of flour,    Three teaspoonfuls of baking powder,    One-half cupful of powdered cocoa,    One teaspoonful of cinnamon.    Beat to mix and then bake in two layers in a moderate oven for  twenty-five minutes. Now place      Left over white of egg,    One-half glassful of apple jelly    in a bowl and beat with a Dover egg-beater to a heavy meringue that  will hold its shape. Use this for filling. For icing use      One cupful of XXXX sugar,    Two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch.    Sift sugar and starch and add sufficient boiling water to moisten,  beat smooth and spread on the cake.      CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE    Place in a bowl      One cup of sugar,    Yolks of two eggs.    Cream and then add      Six tablespoons of shortening,    Three cups of flour,    Five level teaspoons baking powder,    Two teaspoons of vanilla,    One cup of milk or water.    Beat to mix and then cut and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of  two eggs. Bake in two layers in prepared pans and when cool place a  chocolate filling between and ice with chocolate butter cream. See  chocolate filling recipe.      SOFT COOKIES    Place in a saucepan      One cupful of molasses,    Six tablespoons of shortening.    Bring to a boil and then add      One teaspoonful of ginger,    One and one-half teaspoonfuls of cinnamon,    One-half teaspoon of allspice.    Stir to blend and then take from fire and let cool, now add      One egg,    One cupful of sour milk,    One teaspoonful of baking soda.    Beat with a Dover egg-beater to blend and then add sufficient flour  to make a soft dough that can be handled, usually about seven cupfuls.  Form into balls the size of a walnut and then flatten between the  hands. Bake upon a greased and floured inverted baking pan in a  moderate oven for about ten minutes.      CHARLOTTE RUSSE    Bake the sponge cake mixture in muffin pans and then cool. Cut slice  from the top, scoop out the crumbs and then fill with whipped cream or  fruit whip.

Mix thoroughly and drop by a teaspoon on a well-greased and floured  baking sheet and bake for twelve minutes in a moderate oven.      FRUIT CAKE    A handsome and rich fruit cake is usually the accepted cake for  weddings and anniversaries. In the days of long ago the young women of  the household delighted to show their skill in the making and baking  of this queen of cakes. In those days folks felt that it was an  indispensable feature of the feast, and the reveler of to-day holds  it in equal esteem as did his grandad before him. Here is an old and  treasured recipe:    Place one glass of spiced jam in a bowl and add      One tablespoon of cocoa,    One teaspoon of cinnamon,    One-half teaspoon of nutmeg,    Two tablespoons of vanilla extract.    Beat to thoroughly mix and then spread over the cake. Set the cake  in a deep aluminum saucepan or stone crock and put in a warm room  to ripen, until just before Christmas. Then remove the cake from the  crock and wipe with a cloth which has been wrung very dry from hot  water, then ice with chocolate icing.      AN INEXPENSIVE FRUIT CAKE      One cup of syrup,    One-half cup of brown sugar,    One-half cup of shortening,    One egg.    Cream well and then add      Three cups of flour,    One-half cup of cocoa,    Three level tablespoons of baking powder,    One cup of black coffee,    One level tablespoon of cinnamon,   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17451"],[0,"Sign Language Among North American Indians Compared With That Among Other (#9)"],[1,"the  intention to represent the flat hand as in motion from below upward,  as is probable from the connection, the meaning is _much, greatly_.  He strongly disapproves the counsel of the opposite side. Our Indians  often express the idea of quantity, _much_, with the same conception  of comparative height, by an upward motion of the extended palm, but  with them the palm is held downward. The last figure to the right,  by the action of his whole body, shows his rejection of the proposed  delay, and his right hand gives the modern sign of combined surprise  and reproof.    [Illustration: Fig. 72.]    It is interesting to note the similarity of the merely emotional  gestures and attitudes of modern Italy with those of the classics. The  Pulcinella, Fig. 73, for instance, drawn from life in the streets of  Naples, has the same pliancy and _abandon_ of the limbs as appears in  the supposed foolish slaves of the Vatican Terence.    [Illustration: Fig. 73.]    In close connection with this branch of the study reference must be  made to the gestures exhibited in the works of Italian art only modern  in comparison with the high antiquity of their predecessors. A good  instance is in the Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci, painted toward  the close of the fifteenth century, and to the figure of Judas  as there portrayed. The gospel denounces him as a thief, which is  expressed in the painting by the hand extended and slightly curved;  imitative of the pilferer's act in clutching and drawing toward  him furtively the stolen object, and is the same gesture that now  indicates _theft_ in Naples, Fig. 74, and among some of the North  American Indians, Fig. 75. The pictorial propriety of the sign is  preserved by the apparent desire of the traitor to obtain the one  white loaf of bread on the table (the remainder being of coarser  quality) which lies near where his hand is tending. Raffaelle was  equally particular in his exhibition of gesture language, even  unto the minutest detail of the arrangement of the fingers. It is  traditional that he sketched the Madonna's hands for the Spasimo di  Sicilia in eleven different positions before he was satisfied.    [Illustration: Fig. 74.]    No allusion to the bibliography of gesture speech, however slight,  should close without including the works of Mgr. D. De Haerne,  who has, as a member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, in  addition to his rank in the Roman Catholic Church, been active in  promoting the cause of education in general, and especially that of  the deaf and dumb. His admirable treatise _The Natural Language of  Signs_ has been translated and is accessible to American readers in  the _American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb_, 1875. In that valuable  serial, conducted by Prof. E.A. FAY, of the National Deaf Mute College  at Washington, and now in its twenty-sixth volume, a large amount of  the current literature on the subject indicated by its title can be  found.    [Illustration: Fig. 75.]          MODERN USE OF GESTURE SPEECH.    Dr. TYLOR says (_Early History of Mankind_, 44): \"We cannot lay down  as a rule that gesticulation decreases as civilization advances, and  say, for instance, that a Southern Frenchman, because his talk is  illustrated with gestures as a book with pictures, is less civilized  than a German or Englishman.\" This is true, and yet it is almost  impossible for persons not accustomed to gestures to observe them  without associating the idea of low culture. Thus in Mr. Darwin's  summing up of those characteristics of the natives of Tierra  del Fuego, which rendered it difficult to believe them to be  fellow-creatures, he classes their \"violent gestures\" with their  filthy and greasy skins, discordant voices, and hideous faces bedaubed  with paint. This description is quoted by the Duke of Argyle in his  _Unity of Nature_ in approval of those characteristics as evidence, of  the lowest condition of humanity.    Whether or not the power of the visible gesture relative to, and  its influence upon the words of modern oral speech are in inverse  proportion to the general culture, it seems established that they do  not bear that or any constant proportion to the development of the  several languages with which gesture is still more or less associated.  The statement has frequently been made that gesture is yet to some  highly-advanced languages a necessary modifying factor, and that  only when a language has become so artificial as to be completely  expressible in written signs--indeed, has been remodeled through their  long familiar use--can the bodily signs be wholly dispensed with. The  evidence for this statement is now doubted, and it is safer to  affirm that a common use of gesture depends more upon the sociologic  conditions of the speakers than upon the degree of copiousness of  their oral speech.        USE BY OTHER PEOPLES THAN NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.    The nearest approach to a general rule which it is now proposed to  hazard is that where people speaking precisely the same dialect are  not numerous, and are thrown into constant contact on equal terms with  others of differing dialects and languages, gesture is necessarily  resorted to for converse with the latter, and remains for an  indefinite time as a habit or accomplishment among themselves,  while large bodies enjoying common speech, and either isolated from  foreigners, or, when in contact with them, so dominant as to compel  the learning and adoption of their own tongue, become impassive in its  delivery. The ungesturing English, long insular, and now rulers  when spread over continents, may be compared with the profusely  gesticulating Italians dwelling in a maze of dialects and subject for  centuries either to foreign rule or to the influx of strangers on whom  they depended. So common is the use of gestures in Italy, especially  among the lower and uneducated classes, that utterance without them  seems to be nearly impossible. The driver or boatman will often,  on being addressed, involuntarily drop the reins or oars, at the  risk of a serious accident, to respond with his arms and fingers  in accompaniment of his tongue. Nor is the habit confined to the  uneducated. King Ferdinand returning to Naples after the revolt of  1821, and finding that the boisterous multitude would not allow his  voice to be heard, resorted successfully to a royal address in signs,  giving reproaches, threats, admonitions, pardon, and dismissal, to  the entire satisfaction of the assembled lazzaroni. The medium, though  probably not the precise manner of its employment, recalls Lucan's  account of the quieting of an older tumult--                tumultum    Composuit vultu, dextraque silentia fecit.    This rivalry of Punch would, in London, have occasioned measureless  ridicule and disgust. The difference in what is vaguely styled  temperament does not wholly explain the contrast between the two  peoples, for the performance was creditable both to the readiness of  the King in an emergency and to the aptness of his people, the main  distinction being that in Italy there was in 1821, and still is, a  recognized and cultivated language of signs long disused in Great  Britain. In seeking to account for this it will be remembered that the  Italians have a more direct descent from the people who, as has been  above shown, in classic times so long and lovingly cultivated gesture  as a system. They have also had more generally before their eyes the  artistic relics in which gestures have been preserved.    It is a curious fact that some English writers, notably Addison  (_Spectator_, 407), have contended that it does not suit the genius  of that nation to use gestures even in public speaking, against which  doctrine Austin vigorously remonstrates. He says: \"There may possibly  be nations whose livelier feelings incline them more to gesticulation  than is common among us, as there are also countries in which plants  of excellent use to man grow spontaneously; these, by care and  culture, are found to thrive also in colder countries.\"    It is in general to be remarked that as the number of dialects in any  district decreases so will the gestures, though doubtless there is  also weight in the fact not merely that a language has been reduced to  and modified by writing, but that people who are accustomed generally  to read and write, as are the English and Germans, will after a time  think and talk as they write, and without the accompaniments still  persistent among Hindus, Arabs, and the less literate of European  nations.    The fact that in the comparatively small island of Sicily gesture  language has been maintained until the present time in a perfection  not observed elsewhere in Europe must be considered in connection with  the above remark on England's insularity, and it must also be admitted  that several languages have prevailed in the latter, still leaving  dialects. This apparent similarity of conditions renders the contrast  as regards use of gestures more remarkable, yet there are some reasons  for their persistence in Sicily which apply with greater force than  to Great Britain. The explanation, through mere tradition, is that the  common usage of signs dates from the time of Dionysius, the tyrant of  Syracuse, who prohibited meetings and conversation among his subjects,  under the direst penalties, so that they adopted that expedient to  hold communication. It would be more useful to consider the peculiar  history of the island. The Sicanians being its aborigines it was  colonized by Greeks, who, as the Romans asserted, were still more apt  at gesture than themselves. This colonization was also by separate  bands of adventurers from several different states of Greece, so that  they started with dialects and did not unite in a common or national  organization, the separate cities and their territories being governed  by oligarchies or tyrants frequently at war with each other, until,"]]]
