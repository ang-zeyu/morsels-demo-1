The inhabitants assembled hastily at sight of the enemy, and the news,  spreading through the neighbouring tribes, brought together for their  defence a confused crowd of archers, chariots, and horsemen. The  Assyrians, leaping into the stream and climbing up the bank, easily  overpowered these undisciplined troops.    [Illustration: 052.jpg A SKIRMISH IN THE MARSHES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    They captured at the first onset Nagitu, Nagitu-Dibina, Khilmu, Pillatu,  and Khupapanu; and raiding the Kalda, forced them on board the  fleet with their gods, their families, their flocks, and household  possessions, and beat a hurried retreat with their booty.  Merodach-baladan himself and his children once more escaped their  clutches, but the State he had tried to create was annihilated, and  his power utterly crushed. Sennacherib received his generals with great  demonstrations of joy at Bab-Salimeti, and carried the spoil in triumph  to Nineveh. Khalludush, exasperated by the affront put upon him,  instantly retaliated by invading Karduniash, where he pushed forward  as far as Sippara, pillaging and destroying the inhabitants without  opposition. The Babylonians who had accompanied Merodach-baladan into  exile, returned in the train of the Elamites, and, secretly stealing  back to their homes, stirred up a general revolt: Assur-nadin-shumu,  taken prisoner by his own subjects, was put in chains and despatched to  Susa, his throne being bestowed on a Babylonian named Nergal-ushezib,*  who at once took the field (694 B.C.).         * This is the prince whom the Assyrian documents name       Shuzub, and whom we might call Shuzub the Babylonian, in       contradistinction to Mushezib-marduk, who is Shuzub the       Kaldu.    His preliminary efforts were successful: he ravaged the frontier along  the Turnat with the help of the Elamites, and took by assault the city  of Nipur, which refused to desert the cause of Sennacherib (693 B.C.).  Meanwhile the Assyrian generals had captured Uruk (Erech) on the 1st of  Tisri, after the retreat of Khalludush; and having sacked the city, were  retreating northwards with their spoil when they were defeated on the  7th near Nipur by Nergal-ushezib. He had already rescued the statues of  the gods and the treasure, when his horse fell in the midst of the fray,  and he could not disengage himself. His vanquished foes led him captive  to Nineveh, where Sennacherib exposed him in chains at the principal  gateway of his palace: the Babylonians, who owed to him their latest  success, summoned a Kaldu prince, Mushezib-marduk, son of Gahut, to  take command. He hastened to comply, and with the assistance of Blamite  troops offered such a determined resistance to all attack, that he was  finally left in undisturbed possession of his kingdom (692 B.C.): the  actual result to Assyria, therefore, of the ephemeral victory gained by  the fleet had been the loss of Babylon.    [Illustration: 054.jpg THE HORSE OF NERGAL-USHEZIB FALLING IN THE  BATTLE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    A revolution in Elam speedily afforded Assyria an opportunity for  revenge. When Nergal-ushezib was taken prisoner, the people of Susa,  dissatisfied with the want of activity displayed by Khalludush,  conspired to depose him: on hearing, therefore, the news of the  revolutions in Chaldaea, they rose in revolt on the 26th of Tisri, and,  besieging him in his palace, put him to death, and elected a certain  Kutur-nakhunta as his successor. Sennacherib, without a moment's  hesitation, crossed the frontier at Durilu, before order was  re-established at Susa, and recovered, after very slight resistance,  Baza and Bit-khairi which Shutruk-nakhunta had taken from Sargon. This  preliminary success laid the lower plain of Susiana at his mercy, and he  ravaged it pitilessly from Baza to Bit-bunaki. \"Thirty-four strongholds  and the townships depending on them, whose number is unequalled, I  besieged and took by assault, their inhabitants I led into captivity, I  demolished them and reduced them to ashes: I caused the smoke of their  burning to rise into the wide heaven, like the smoke of one great  sacrifice.\" Kutur-nakhunta, still insecurely seated on the throne of  Susa, retreated with his army towards Khaidalu, in the almost unexplored  regions which bordered the Banian plateau,* and entrenched himself  strongly in the heart of the mountains.         * Khaidalu is very probably the present Dis Malkan.    The season was already well advanced when the Assyrians set out on this  expedition, and November set in while they were ravaging the plain:  but the weather was still so fine that Sennacherib determined to take  advantage of it to march upon Madaktu. Hardly had he scaled the heights  when winter fell upon him with its accompaniment of cold and squally  weather. \"Violent storms broke out, it rained and snowed incessantly,  the torrents and streams overflowed their banks,\" so that hostilities  had to be suspended and the troops ordered back to Nineveh. The effect  produced, however, by these bold measures was in no way diminished:  though Kutur-nakhunta had not had the necessary time to prepare for the  contest, he was nevertheless discredited among his subjects for failing  to bring them out of it with glory, and three months after the retreat  of the Assyrians he was assassinated in a riot on the 20th of Ab, 692  B.C.*         * The Assyrian documents merely mention the death of Kutur-       nakhunta less than three months after the return of       Sennacherib to Nineveh. Pinches' _Babylonian Chronicle_ only       mentions the revolution in which he perished, and informs us       that he had reigned ten months. It contracts Umman-minanu,       the name of the Elamite king, to Minanu.    His younger brother, Umman-minanu, assumed the crown, and though his  enemies disdainfully refused to credit him with either prudence or  judgment, he soon restored his kingdom to such a formidable degree of  power that Mushezib-marduk thought the opportunity a favourable one for  striking a blow at Assyria, from which she could never recover. Elam had  plenty of troops, but was deficient in the resources necessary to pay  the men and their chiefs, and to induce the tribes of the table-land  to furnish their contingents. Mushezib-marduk, therefore, emptied the  sacred treasury of E-sagilla, and sent the gold and silver of Bel and  Zarpanit to Umman-minanu with a message which ran thus: \"Assemble thine  army, and prepare thy camp, come to Babylon and strengthen our hands,  for thou art our help.\" The Elamite asked nothing better than to avenge  the provinces so cruelly harassed, and the cities consumed in the course  of the last campaign: he summoned all his nobles, from the least to the  greatest, and enlisted the help of the troops of Parsuas, Ellipi, and  Anzan, the Aramaean Puqudu and Gambulu of the Tigris, as well as  the Aramaeans of the Euphrates, and the peoples of Bit-Adini and  Bit-Amukkani, who had rallied round Sam una, son of Merodach-baladan,  and joined forces with the soldiers of Mushezib-marduk in Babylon.  \"Like an invasion of countless locusts swooping down upon the land, they  assembled, resolved to give me battle, and the dust of their feet rose  before me, like a thick cloud which darkens the copper-coloured dome of  the sky.\" The conflict took place near the township of Khalule, on the  banks of the Tigris, not far from the confluence of this river with the  Turnat.*         * Haupt attributes to the name the signification _holes,       bogs_, and this interpretation agrees well enough with the       state of the country round the mouths of the Diyala, in the       low-lying district which separates that river from the       Tigris; he compares it with the name Haulayeh, quoted by       Arab geographers in this neighbourhood, and with that of the       canton of Haleh, mentioned in Syrian texts as belonging to       the district of Radhan, between the Adhem and the Diyala.    At this point the Turnat, flowing through the plain, divides into  several branches, which ramify again and again, and form a kind of delta  extending from the ruins of Nayan to those of Reshadeh. During the whole  of the day the engagement between the two hosts raged on this unstable  soil, and their leaders themselves sold their lives dearly in the  struggle. Sennacherib invoked the help of Assur, Sin, Shamash, Nebo,  Bel, Nergal, Ishtar of Nineveh, and Ishtar of Arbela, and the gods heard  his prayers. \"Like a lion I raged, I donned my harness, I covered my  head with my casque, the badge of war; my powerful battle-chariot, which  mows down the rebels, I ascended it in haste in the rage of my heart;  the strong bow which Assur entrusted to me, I seized it, and the  javelin, destroyer of life, I grasped it: the whole host of obdurate  rebels I charged, shining like silver or like the day, and I roared as  Kamman roareth.\" Khumba-undash, the Elamite general, was killed in one  of the first encounters, and many of his officers perished around him,  \"of those who wore golden daggers at their belts, and bracelets of  gold on their wrists.\" They fell one after the other, \"like fat bulls  chained\" for the sacrifice, or like sheep, and their blood flowed on the  broad plain as the water after a violent storm: the horses plunged in it  up to their knees, and the body of the royal chariot was reddened with  it. A son of Merodach-baladan, Nabu-shumishkun, was taken prisoner, but  Umman-minanu and Mushezib-marduk escaped unhurt from the fatal field. It  seems as if fortune had at last decided in favour of the Assyrians, and  they proclaimed the fact loudly, but their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#9)"],[1,"and installed the  prince.**         * The fragment of Menander does not give the Babylonian       king's name, but a simple chronological calculation proves       him to have been Nergal-sharuzur.         ** _Annals of Nabonidus_, where mention is made of a certain       Nabu-makhdan-uzur--but the reading of the name is uncertain       --who seems to be in revolt against the Chaldaeans. Floigl has       very ingeniously harmonised the dates of the Annals with       those obtained from the fragment of Menander, and has thence       concluded that the object of the expedition of the third       year was the enthroning of Hirom which is mentioned in the       fragment, and during whose fourteenth year Cyrus became King       of Babylon.    This took place at the very moment when Cyrus was preparing his  expedition against Astyages; and the Babylonian monarch took advantage  of the agitation into which the Medes were thrown by this invasion, to  carry into execution a project which he had been planning ever since his  accession. Shortly after that event he had had a dream, in which Marduk,  the great lord, and Sin, the light of heaven and earth, had appeared  on either side of his couch, the former addressing him in the following  words: \"Nabonidus, King of Babylon, with the horses of thy chariot bring  brick, rebuild E-khul-khul, the temple of Harran, that Sin, the great  lord, may take up his abode therein.\" Nabonidus had respectfully pointed  out that the town was in the hands of the Scythians, who were subjects  of the Medes, but the god had replied: \"The Scythian of whom thou  speakest, he, his country and the kings his protectors, are no more.\"  Cyrus was the instrument of the fulfilment of the prophecy. Nabonidus  took possession of Harran without difficulty, and immediately put the  necessary work in hand. This was, indeed, the sole benefit that he  derived from the changes which were taking place, and it is probable  that his inaction was the result of the enfeebled condition of the  empire. The country over which he ruled, exhausted by the Assyrian  conquest, and depopulated by the Scythian invasions, had not had time to  recover its forces since it had passed into the hands of the Chaldaeans;  and the wars which Nebuchadrezzar had been obliged to undertake for the  purpose of strengthening his own power, though few in number and not  fraught with danger, had tended to prolong the state of weakness into  which it had sunk. If the hero of the dynasty who had conquered Egypt  had not ventured to measure his strength with the Median princes, and  if he had courted the friendship not only of the warlike Cyaxares but of  the effeminate Astyages, it would not be prudent for Nabonidus to come  into collision with the victorious new-comers from the heart of Iran.  Chaldsea doubtless was right in avoiding hostilities, at all events so  long as she had to bear the brunt of them alone, but other nations  had not the same motives for exercising prudence, and Lydia was fully  assured that the moment had come for her to again take up the ambitious  designs which the treaty of 585 had forced her to renounce. Alyattes,  relieved from anxiety with regard to the Medes, had confined his  energies to establishing firmly his kingdom in the regions of Asia Minor  extending westwards from the Halys and the Anti-Taurus. The acquisition  of Colophon, the destruction of Smyrna, the alliance with the towns of  the littoral, had ensured him undisputed possession of the valleys of  the Caicus and the Hermus, but the plains of the Maeander in the south,  and the mountainous districts of Mysia in the north, were not yet fully  brought under his sway. He completed the occupation of the Troad and  Mysia about 584, and afterwards made of the entire province an appanage  for Adramyttios, who was either his son or his brother.*         * The doings of Alyattes in Troas and in Mysia are vouched       for by the anecdote related by Plutarch concerning this       king's relations with Pittakos. The founding of Adramyttium       is attributed to him by Stephen of Byzantium, after       Aristotle, who made Adramyttios the brother of Croesus.       Radat gives good reasons for believing that Adramyttios was       brother to Alyattes and uncle to Crosus, and the same person       as Adramys, the son of Sadyattes, according to Xanthus of       Lydia. Radet gives the year 584 for the date of these       events.    He even carried his arms into Bithynia, where, to enforce his rule, he  built several strongholds, one of which, called Alyatta, commanded  the main road leading from the basin of the Rhyndacus to that of  the Sangarius, skirting the spurs of Olympus.* He experienced some  difficulty in reducing Caria, and did not finally succeed in his efforts  till nearly the close of his reign in 566. Adramyttios was then dead,  and his fief had devolved on his eldest surviving brother or nephew,  Crosus, whose mother was by birth a Carian. This prince had incurred  his father's displeasure by his prodigality, and an influential party  desired that he should be set aside in favour of his brother Pantaleon,  the son of Alyattes by an Ionian. Croesus, having sown his wild oats,  was anxious to regain his father's favour, and his only chance of so  doing was by distinguishing himself in the coming war, if only money  could be found for paying his mercenaries. Sadyattes, the richest banker  in Lydia, who had already had dealings with all the members of the royal  family, refused to make him a loan, but Theokharides of Priene advanced  him a thousand gold staters, which enabled Crosus to enroll his  contingent at Bphesus, and to be the first to present himself at the  rallying-place for the troops.**         * Radet places the operations in Bithynia before the Median       war, towards 594 at the latest. I think that they are more       probably connected with those in Mysia, and that they form       part of the various measures taken after the Median war to       achieve the occupation of the regions west of the Halys.         ** A mutilated extract from Xanthus of Lydia in Suidas seems       to carry these events back to the time of the war against       Priene, towards the beginning of the reign. The united       evidence of the accompanying circumstances proves that they       belong to the time of the old age of Alyattes, and makes it       very likely that they occurred in 566, the date proposed by       Radet for the Carian campaign.    Caria was annexed to the kingdom, but the conditions under which the  annexation took place are not known to us;* and Croesus contributed so  considerably to the success of the campaign, that he was reinstated in  popular favour. Alyattes, however, was advancing in years, and was soon  about to rejoin his adversaries Cyaxares and Nebuchadrezzar in Hades.  Like the Pharaohs, the kings of Lydia were accustomed to construct  during their lifetime the monuments in which they were to repose after  death. Their necropolis was situated not far from Sardes, on the shores  of the little lake Gygaea; it was here, close to the resting-place of  his ancestors and their wives, that Alyattes chose the spot for his  tomb,** and his subjects did not lose the opportunity of proving to what  extent he had gained their affections.         * The fragment of Nicolas of Damascus does not speak of the       result of the war, but it was certainly favourable, for       Herodotus counts the Carians among Croesus' subjects.         ** The only one of these monuments, besides that of       Alyattes, which is mentioned by the ancients, belonged to       one of the favourites of Gyges, and was called _the Tomb of       the Courtesan_. Strabo, by a manifest error, has applied       this name _to_ the tomb of Alyattes.    [Illustration: 050.jpg THE TUMULUS OF ALYATTES AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE  PASSAGE]         Drawn by Boudier, from the sketch by Spiegolthal.    His predecessors had been obliged to finish their work at their own  expense and by forced labour;* but in the case of Alyattes the three  wealthiest classes of the population, the merchants, the craftsmen, and  the courtesans, all united to erect for him an enormous tumulus, the  remains of which still rise 220 feet above the plains of the Hermus.      * This, at least, seems to be the import of the passage in Clearchus of  Soli, where that historian gives an account of the erection of the _Tomb  of the Courtesan_.      [Illustration: 051.jpg ONE OF THE LYDIAN ORNAMENTS IN THE LOUVRE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph.    The sub-structure consisted of a circular wall of great blocks of  limestone resting on the solid rock, and it contained in the centre  a vault of grey marble which was reached by a vaulted passage. A huge  mound of red clay and yellowish earth was raised above the chamber,  surmounted by a small column representing a phallus, and by four stelae  covered with inscriptions, erected at the four cardinal points. It  follows the traditional type of burial-places in use among the old  Asianic races, but it is constructed with greater regularity than most  of them; Alyattes was laid within it in 561, after a glorious reign of  forty-nine years.*         * Herodotus gave fifty-seven years' length of reign to       Alyattes, whilst the chronographers, who go back as far as       Xanthus of Lydia, through Julius Africanus, attribute to him       only forty-nine; historians now prefer the latter figures,       at least as representing the maximum length of reign.

It was wholly due to him that Lydia was for the moment raised to the  level of the most powerful states which then existed on the eastern  shores of the Mediterranean. He was by nature of a violent and  uncontrolled temper, and during his earlier years he gave way to fits of  anger, in "]]]
