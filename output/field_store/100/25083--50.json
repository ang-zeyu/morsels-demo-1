A Watts-and-Wesley Scholarship would grace any Theological Seminary, to  encourage the study and discussion of the best lyrics of the two great  Gospel bards.      _THE TUNES._    The musical mouth-piece of \"O for a thousand tongues,\" nearest to its  own date, is old \"Azmon\" by Carl Glaser (1734-1829), appearing as No. 1  in the _New Methodist Hymnal_. Arranged by Lowell Mason, 1830, it is  still comparatively familiar, and the flavor of devotion is in its tone  and style.    Henry John Gauntlett, an English lawyer and composer, wrote a tune for  it in 1872, noble in its uniform step and time, but scarcely uttering  the hymnist's characteristic ardor.    The tune of \"Dedham,\" by William Gardiner, now venerable but surviving  by true merit, is not unlike \"Azmon\" in movement and character. Though  less closely associated with the hymn, as a companion melody it is not  inappropriate. But whatever the range of vocalization or the dignity of  swells and cadences, a slow pace of single semibreves or quarters is not  suited to Wesley's hymns. They are flights.    Professor William Gardiner wrote many works on musical subjects early in  the last century, and composed vocal harmonies, secular and sacred. He  was born in Leicester, Eng., March 5, 1770, and died there Nov. 16,  1853.    There is an old-fashioned unction and vigor in the style of  \"Peterborough\" by Rev. Ralph Harrison (1748-1810) that after all best  satisfies the singer who enters heart and soul into the spirit of the  hymn. _Old Peterborough_ was composed in 1786.      \"LORD WITH GLOWING HEART I'D PRAISE THEE.\"    This was written in 1817 by the author of the \"Star Spangled Banner,\"  and is a noble American hymn of which the country may well be proud,  both because of its merit and for its birth in the heart of a national  poet who was no less a Christian than a patriot.    Francis Scott Key, lawyer, was born on the estate of his father, John  Ross Key, in Frederick, Md., Aug. 1st, 1779; and died in Baltimore, Jan.  11, 1843. A bronze statue of him over his grave, and another in Golden  Gate Park, San Francisco, represent the nationality of his fame and the  gratitude of a whole land.    Though a slaveholder by inheritance, Mr. Key deplored the existence of  human slavery, and not only originated a scheme of African colonization,  but did all that a model master could do for the chattels on his  plantation, in compliance with the Scripture command,[6] to lighten  their burdens. He helped them in their family troubles, defended them  gratuitously in the courts, and held regular Sunday-school services for  them.    [Footnote 6: Eph. 6:9, Coloss. 4:1.]    Educated at St. John's College, an active member of the Episcopal  Church, he was not only a scholar but a devout and exemplary man.        Lord, with glowing heart I'd praise Thee        For the bliss Thy love bestows,      For the pardoning grace that saves me,        And the peace that from it flows.        Help, O Lord, my weak endeavor;        This dull soul to rapture raise;      Thou must light the flame or never        Can my love be warmed to praise.        Lord, this bosom's ardent feeling        Vainly would my life express;      Low before Thy footstool kneeling,        Deign Thy suppliant's prayer to bless.        Let Thy grace, my soul's chief treasure,        Love's pure flame within me raise,      And, since words can never measure,        Let my life show forth Thy praise.      _THE TUNE._    \"St. Chad,\" a choral in D, with a four-bar unison, in the _Evangelical  Hymnal_, is worthy of the hymn. Richard Redhead, the composer, organist  of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Paddington, Eng., was born at  Harrow, Middlesex, March 1, 1820, and educated at Magdalene College,  Oxford. Graduated Bachelor of Music at Oxford, 1871. He published  _Laudes Dominae_, a Gregorian Psalter, 1843, a Book of Tunes for the  _Christian Year_, and is the author of much ritual music.      \"HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY.\"    There is nothing so majestic in Protestant hymnology as this Tersanctus  of Bishop Heber.    The Rt. Rev. Reginald Heber, son of a clergyman of the same name, was  born in Malpas, Cheshire, Eng., April 21st, 1783, and educated at  Oxford. He served the church in Hodnet, Shropshire, for about twenty  years, and was then appointed Bishop of Calcutta, E.I. His labors there  were cut short in the prime of his life, his death occurring in 1826, at  Trichinopoly on the 3d of April, his natal month.    His hymns, numbering fifty-seven, were collected by his widow, and  published with his poetical works in 1842.        Holy! holy! holy! Lord God Almighty!        Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.      Holy! holy! holy! merciful and mighty,        God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity.        Holy! holy! holy! all the saints adore Thee,        Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;      Cherubim and seraphim, falling down before Thee,        Which wert, and art, and evermore shall be.      _THE TUNE._    Grand as the hymn is, it did not come to its full grandeur of sentiment  and sound in song-worship till the remarkable music of Dr. John B. Dykes  was joined to it. None was ever written that in performance illustrates  more admirably the solemn beauty of congregational praise. The name  \"Nicaea\" attached to the tune means nothing to the popular ear and mind,  and it is known everywhere by the initial words of the first line.    Rev. John Bacchus Dykes, Doctor of Music, was born at  Kingston-upon-Hull, in 1823; and graduated at Cambridge, in 1847. He  became a master of tone and choral harmony, and did much to reform and  elevate congregational psalmody in England. He was perhaps the first to  demonstrate that hymn-tune making can be reduced to a science without  impairing its spiritual purpose. Died Jan. 22, 1876.      \"LORD OF ALL BEING, THRONED AFAR.\"    This noble hymn was composed by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, born in  Cambridge, Mass., 1809, and graduated at Harvard University. A physician  by profession, he was known as a practitioner chiefly in literature,  being a brilliant writer and long the leading poetical wit of America.  He was, however, a man of deep religious feeling, and a devout attendant  at King's Chapel, Unitarian, in Boston where he spent his life. He held  the Harvard Professorship of Anatomy and Physiology more than fifty  years, but his enduring work is in his poems, and his charming volume,  _The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table_. Died Jan. 22, 1896.      _THE TUNE._    Holmes' hymn is sung in some churches to \"Louvan,\" V.C. Taylor's  admirable praise tune. Other hymnals prefer with it the music of  \"Keble,\" one of Dr. Dykes' appropriate and finished melodies.    Virgil Corydon Taylor, an American vocal composer, was born in  Barkhamstead, Conn., April 2, 1817, died 1891.          CHAPTER II.    SOME HYMNS OF GREAT WITNESSES.      JOHN OF DAMASCUS.    [Greek: Erchesthe, o pistoi,          Anastaseos Hemera.]    John of Damascus, called also St. John of Jerusalem, a theologian and  poet, was the last but one of the Christian Fathers of the Greek Church.  This eminent man was named by the Arabs \"Ibn Mansur,\" Son (Servant?) of  a Conqueror, either in honor of his father Sergius or because it was a  Semitic translation of his family title. He was born in Damascus early  in the 8th century, and seems to have been in favor with the Caliph, and  served under him many years in some important civil capacity, until,  retiring to Palestine, he entered the monastic order, and late in life  was ordained a priest of the Jerusalem Church. He died in the Convent of  St. Sabas near that city about A.D. 780.    His lifetime appears to have been passed in comparative peace. Mohammed  having died before completing the conquest of Syria, the Moslem rule  before whose advance Oriental Christianity was to lose its first field  of triumph had not yet asserted its persecuting power in the north. This  devout monk, in his meditations at St. Sabas, dwelt much upon the birth  and the resurrection of Christ, and made hymns to celebrate them. It was  probably four hundred years before Bonaventura (?) wrote the Christmas  \"Adeste Fideles\" of the Latin West that John of Damascus composed his  Greek \"Adeste Fideles\" for a Resurrection song in Jerusalem.        Come ye faithful, raise the strain        Of triumphant gladness.           *       *       *       *       *       'Tis the spring of souls today        Christ hath burst His prison;      From the frost and gloom of death        Light and life have risen.    The nobler of the two hymns preserved to us, (or six stanzas of it)  through eleven centuries is entitled \"The Day of Resurrection.\"        The day of resurrection,        Earth, tell its joys abroad:      The Passover of gladness,        The Passover of God.      From death to life eternal,        From earth unto the sky,      Our Christ hath brought us over,        With hymns of victory.        Our hearts be pure from evil,        That we may see aright      The Lord in rays eternal        Of resurrection light;      And, listening to His accents,        May hear, so calm and plain,      His own, \"All hail!\" and hearing,        May raise the victor-strain.        Now let the heavens be joyful,        Let earth her song begin,      Let all the world keep triumph,        All that dwell therein.      In grateful exultation,        Their notes let all things blend,      For Christ the Lord is risen,        O joy that hath no end!    Both these hymns of John of Damascus were translated by John Mason  Neale.      _THE TUNE._    \"The Day of Resurrection\" is sung in the modern hymnals to the tune of  \"Rotterdam,\" composed by Berthold of Tours, born in that city of the  Netherlands, Dec. 17, 1838. He was educated at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#9)"],[1,"unanimously, in point of fact, Painting and Music are  sisters.\"    \"Sisters-in-law,\" observed Marcel.    At that moment Colline and Rodolphe, who had met one another, came in.    Marcel and Schaunard informed them of their partnership.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Rodolphe, tapping his waistcoat pocket, \"I am ready to  stand dinner all round.\"    \"That is just what I was going to have the honour of proposing,\" said  Colline, taking out a gold coin which he stuck in his eye like a glass.  \"My prince gave me this to buy an Arabic grammar, which I have just paid  six sous ready cash for.\"    \"I,\" said Rodolphe, \"have got the cashier of the 'Scarf of Iris' to  advance me thirty francs under the pretext that I wanted it to get  vaccinated.\"    \"It is general pay-day then?\" said Schaunard, \"there is only myself  unable to stand anything. It is humiliating.\"    \"Meanwhile,\" said Rodolphe, \"I maintain my offer of a dinner.\"    \"So do I,\" said Colline.    \"Very well,\" said Rodolphe, \"we will toss up which shall settle the  bill.\"    \"No,\" said Schaunard, \"I have something far better than that to offer  you as a way of getting over the difficulty.\"    \"Let us have it.\"    \"Rodolphe shall pay for dinner, and Colline shall stand supper.\"    \"That is what I call Solomonic jurisprudence,\" exclaimed the  philosopher.    \"It is worse than Camacho's wedding,\" added Marcel.    The dinner took place at a Provencal restaurant in the Rue Dauphine,  celebrated for its literary waiters and its \"Ayoli.\" As it was necessary  to leave room for the supper, they ate and drank in moderation. The  acquaintance, begun the evening before between Colline and Schaunard and  later on with Marcel, became more intimate; each of the young fellows  hoisted the flag of his artistic opinions, and all four recognized that  they had like courage and similar hopes. Talking and arguing they  perceived that their sympathies were akin, that they had all the same  knack in that chaff which amuses without hurting, and that the virtues  of youth had not left a vacant spot in their heart, easily stirred by  the sight of the narration of anything noble. All four starting from the  same mark to reach the same goal, they thought that there was something  more than chance in their meeting, and that it might after all be  Providence who thus joined their hands and whispered in their ears the  evangelic motto, which should be the sole charter of humanity, \"Love one  another.\"    At the end of the repast, which closed in somewhat grave mood, Rodolphe  rose to propose a toast to the future, and Colline replied in a short  speech that was not taken from any book, had no pretension to style,  and was merely couched in the good old dialect of simplicity, making  that which is so badly delivered so well understood.    \"What a donkey this philosopher is!\" murmured Schaunard, whose face was  buried in his glass, \"here is he obliging me to put water in my wine.\"    After dinner they went to take coffee at the Cafe Momus, where they had  already spent the preceding evening. It was from that day that the  establishment in question became uninhabitable by its other frequenters.    After coffee and nips of liqueurs the Bohemian clan, definitely founded,  returned to Marcel's lodging, which took the name of Schaunard's  Elysium. Whilst Colline went to order the supper he had promised, the  others bought squibs, crackers and other pyrotechnic materials, and  before sitting down to table they let off from the windows a magnificent  display of fireworks which turned the whole house topsy-turvey, and  during which the four friends shouted at the top of their voices--        \"Let us celebrate this happy day.\"    The next morning they again found themselves all four together but  without seeming astonished this time. Before each going about his  business they went together and breakfasted frugally at the Cafe Momus,  where they made an appointment for the evening and where for a long time  they were seen to return daily.    Such are the chief personages who will reappear in the episodes of which  this volume is made up, a volume which is not a romance and has no other  pretension than that set forth on its title-page, for the \"Bohemians of  the Latin Quarter\" is only a series of social studies, the heroes of  which belong to a class badly judged till now, whose greatest crime is  lack of order, and who can even plead in excuse that this very lack of  order is a necessity of the life they lead.          CHAPTER II    A GOOD ANGEL      Schaunard and Marcel, who had been grinding away valiantly a whole  morning, suddenly struck work.    \"Thunder and lightning! I'm hungry!\" cried Schaunard. And he added  carelessly, \"Do we breakfast today?\"    Marcel appeared much astonished at this very inopportune question.    \"How long has it been the fashion to breakfast two days running?\" he  asked. \"And yesterday was Thursday.\" He finished his reply by tracing  with his mahl-stick the ecclesiastic ordinance:        \"On Friday eat no meat,       Nor aught resembling it.\"    Schaunard, finding no answer, returned to his picture, which represented  a plain inhabited by a red tree and a blue tree shaking branches; an  evident allusion to the sweets of friendship, which had a very  philosophical effect.    At this moment the porter knocked; he had brought a letter for Marcel.    \"Three sous,\" said he.    \"You are sure?\" replied the artist. \"Very well, you can owe it to us.\"    He shut the door in the man's face, and opened the letter. At the first  line, he began to vault around the room like a rope-dancer and thundered  out, at the top of his voice, this romantic ditty, which indicated with  him the highest pitch of ecstasy:        \"There were four juveniles in our street;       They fell so sick they could not eat;       They carried them to the hospital!--       Tal! Tal! Tal! Tal!\"    \"Oh yes!\" said Schaunard, taking him up:        \"They put all four into one big bed,       Two at the feet and two at the head.\"    \"Think I don't know it?\" Marcel continued:        \"There came a sister of Charity--       Ty! Ty! tee! tee!\"    \"If you don't stop,\" said Schaunard, who suspected signs of mental  alienation, \"I'll play the allegro of my symphony on 'The Influence of  Blue in the Arts.'\" So saying, he approached the piano.    This menace had the effect of a drop of cold water in a boiling fluid.  Marcel grew calm as if by magic. \"Look there!\" said he, passing the  letter to his friend. It was an invitation to dine with a deputy, an  enlightened patron of the arts in general and Marcel in particular,  since the latter had taken the portrait of his country-house.    \"For today,\" sighed Schaunard. \"Unluckily the ticket is not good for  two. But stay! Now I think of it, your deputy is of the government  party; you cannot, you must not accept. Your principles will not permit  you to partake of the bread which has been watered by the tears of the  people.\"    \"Bah!\" replied Marcel, \"my deputy is a moderate radical; he voted  against the government the other day. Besides, he is going to get me an  order, and he has promised to introduce me in society. Moreover, this  may be Friday as much as it likes; I am famished as Ugolino, and I mean  to dine today. There now!\"    \"There are other difficulties,\" continued Schaunard, who could not help  being a little jealous of the good fortune that had fallen to his  friend's lot. \"You can't dine out in a red flannel shirt and slippers.\"    \"I shall borrow clothes of Rodolphe or Colline.\"    \"Infatuated youth! Do you forget that this is the twentieth, and at this  time of the month their wardrobe is up to the very top of the spout?\"    \"Between now and five o'clock this evening I shall find a dress-coat.\"    \"I took three weeks to get one when I went to my cousin's wedding and  that was in January.\"    \"Well, then, I shall go as I am,\" said Marcel, with a theatrical stride.  \"It shall certainly never be said that a miserable question of etiquette  hindered me from making my first step in society.\"    \"Without boots,\" suggested his friend.    Marcel rushed out in a state of agitation impossible to describe. At the  end of two hours he returned, loaded with a false collar.    \"Hardly worth while to run so far for that,\" said Schaunard. \"There was  paper enough to make a dozen.\"    \"But,\" cried Marcel, tearing his hair, \"we must have some  things--confound it!\" And he commenced a thorough investigation of every  corner of the two rooms. After an hour's search, he realized a costume  thus composed:    A pair of plaid trousers, a gray hat, a red cravat, a blue waistcoat,  two boots, one black glove, and one glove that had been white.    \"That will make two black gloves on a pinch,\" said Schaunard. \"You are  going to look like the solar spectrum in that dress. To be sure, a  colourist such as you are--\"    Marcel was trying the boots. Alas! They are both for the same foot! The  artist, in despair, perceived an old boot in a corner which had served  as the receptacle of their empty bladders. He seized upon it.    \"From Garrick to Syllable,\" said his jesting comrade, \"one square-toed  and the other round.\"    \"I am going to varnish them and it won't show.\"    \"A good idea! Now you only want the dress-coat.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Marcel, biting his fists:        \"To have one would I give ten years of life,       And this right hand, I tell thee.\"    They heard another knock at the door. Marcel opened it.    \"Monsieur Schaunard?\" inquired a stranger, halting on the threshold.    \"At your service,\" replied the painter, inviting him in.    The stranger had one of those honest faces which typify the provincial.    \"Sir,\" said he. \"My cousin has often spoke to me of your talent for  portrait painting, and being on the point of making a voyage to the  colonies, whither I am deputed by the sugar refiners of the city of  Nantes, I wish to leave my family something to remember me by. That is  why I am "]]]
