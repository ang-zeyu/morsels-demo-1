Did you think I saw anything?\"    \"I hoped you had,\" he smiled. \"If your eyes had chanced to be turned  toward that end of the gallery----\"    \"But I was going the other way. My back was to it, not my face--like  this.\" And wheeling herself about, she showed him that she had been  walking toward the rear of the building rather than advancing toward the  front.    His disappointment was great; but it would have been greater if he had  not realized that under these conditions she was in the precise position  to meet face to face any person emerging into the court from the foot of  the small staircase. If she could tell him of having seen any such  person, and closely enough to be able to give a description of this  person's appearance, then she might prove to be his prime witness, after  all. But she could not satisfy him on this point. She had been on her way  out, and was too busy searching in her bag for her umbrella check to  notice whether there were people about her or not. She had not found it  when the great shout came.    \"And then?\"    Oh, then she was so frightened and so shocked that everything swam before  her eyes and she nearly fell! Her heart was not a strong one and  sometimes missed a beat or two, and she thought it must have done so  then, for when her head steadied again, she found herself clinging to the  balustrade of the great staircase.    \"Then you have nothing whatever to add to what the others have told?\"    Her \"no,\" if a shaky one, was decisive, and seeing no reason for  detaining her further, he gave her permission to depart.    Disturbed in his calculations, but not disheartened, Mr. Gryce next  proceeded to interrogate the door-man at this end of the building. From  his position, facing as he did the approach from the small staircase, he  should be able to say, if the old lady could not, whether anyone had  crossed the open strip of court toward which she had been advancing. But  Mr. Gryce found him no more clear-headed on this point than she. He was  the oldest man connected with the museum, and had been very much shaken  up by what had occurred. Really, he could not say whether anyone had  passed across his line of vision at that time or not. All he could be  sure of was that no attempt had been made by anyone to reach the door  after he had been bidden to close it.    So this clue ended like the rest in no thoroughfare. Would he have any  better luck with the subject of his next inquiry? The young lady  tabulated as No. 13 was where she could have seen the upper edge of the  tapestry shake if she had been looking that way; but she was not. She  also was going from instead of toward the point of interest--in other  words, entering and not leaving the room on whose threshold she stood.    Only two men were left from whom he could hope to obtain the important  testimony he was so anxiously seeking: Nos. 10 and 11. He had turned back  toward the bench where they should be awaiting his attention and was  debating whether he would gain more by attacking them singly or together,  when he suddenly became aware of a fact which drove all these small  considerations out of his mind.    According to every calculation and according to the chart, there should  be only these two men on that bench. But he saw _three_. Who was this  third man, and where had he come from?          VI    THE MAN IN THE GALLERY      Beckoning to Sweetwater, Mr. Gryce pointed out this extra man and asked  him if he recognized him as one of the twenty-two he had tabulated.    The answer was a vigorous no. \"It's a new face to me. He must have  dropped from the roof or come up through the flooring. He certainly  wasn't anywhere about when I made out my list. He looks a trifle hipped,  eh?\"    \"Troubled--decidedly troubled.\"    \"You might go a little further and say done up.\"    \"Good-looking, though. Appears to be of foreign birth.\"    \"English, I should say, and just over.\"    \"English, without a doubt. I'll go speak to him; you wait here, but watch  out for the Coroner, and send him my way as soon as he's at leisure.\"    Then he reapproached the bench, and observing, with the keenness with  which he observed everything without a direct look, that with each step  he took the stranger's confusion increased, he decided to wait till after  he had finished with the others, before he entered upon an inquiry which  might prove not only lengthy but of the first importance.    He was soon very glad that he had done this. He got nothing from Mr.  Simpson; but the questions put to Mr. Turnbull were more productive.  Almost at the first word, this gentleman acknowledged that he had seen  a movement in the great square of tapestry to which Mr. Gryce drew his  attention. He did not know when, or just where he stood at the time,  but he certainly had noticed it shake.    \"Can you describe the movement?\" asked the gratified detective.    \"It swayed out----\"    \"As if blown by some wind?\"    \"No, more as if pushed forward by a steady hand.\"    \"Good! And what then?\"    \"It settled back almost without a quiver.\"    \"Instantly?\"    \"No, not instantly. A moment or two passed before it fell back into  place.\"    \"This was before the attendant Correy called out his alarm, of course?\"    Yes, of course it was before; but how long before, he couldn't say. A  minute--two minutes--five minutes--how could he tell! He had no watch in  hand.    Mr. Gryce thought possibly he might assist the man's memory on this point  but forbore to do so at the time. It was enough for his present purpose  that the necessary link to the establishment of his theory had been  found. No more doubt now that the bow lying in the niche of the doorway  overhead had been the one made use of in this desperate tragedy; and the  way thus cleared for him, he could confidently proceed in his search for  the man who had flung it there. He believed him to be within his reach at  that very moment, but his countenance gave no index to his thought as  reapproaching the young man now sitting all alone on the bench, he halted  before him and pleasantly inquired:    \"Do I see you for the first time? I thought we had listed the name of  every person in the building. How is it that we did not get yours?\"    The tide of color which instantly flooded the young man's countenance  astonished Mr. Gryce both by its warmth and fullness. If he were as  thin-skinned as this betokened, one should experience but little  difficulty in reaching the heart of his trouble.    With an air of quiet interest Mr. Gryce sat down by the young man's side.  Would this display of friendliness have the effect of restoring some of  his self-possession and giving him the confidence he evidently lacked?  No, the red fled from his cheek, and a ghastly white took its place; but  he showed no other change.    Meantime the detective studied his countenance. It was a good one, but  just now so distorted by suffering that only such as were familiar with  his every look could read his character from his present expression.  Would a more direct question rouse him? Possibly. At all events, Mr.  Gryce decided to make the experiment.    \"Will you give me your name?\" he asked, \"--your name and residence?\"    The man he addressed gave a quick start, pulled himself together and made  an attempt to reply.    \"My name is Travis. I am an Englishman just off the steamer from  Southampton. My home is in the county of Hertfordshire. I have no  residence here.\"    \"Your hotel, then?\"    Another flush--then quickly: \"I have not yet chosen one.\"    This was too surprising for belief. A stranger in town without rooms or  hotel accommodations, making use of the morning hours to visit a museum!    \"You must be very much interested in art!\" observed his inquisitor a  little dryly.    Again that flush and again the quick-recurring pallor.    \"I--I am interested in all things beautiful,\" he replied at last in  broken tones.    \"I see. May I ask where you were when that arrow flew which killed a  young lady visitor? Not in this part of the court, I take it?\"    Mr. Travis gave a quick shudder and that was all. The detective waited,  but no other answer came.    \"I am told that as she fell she uttered one cry. Did you hear it, Mr.  Travis?\"    \"It wasn't a cry,\" was his quick reply. \"It was something quite  different, but dreadful, dreadful!\"    Mr. Gryce's manner changed.    \"Then you did hear it. You were near enough to distinguish between a  scream and a gasp. Where were you, and why weren't you seen by my man  when he went through the building?\"    \"I--I was kneeling out of sight--too shocked to move. But I grew tired of  that and wanted to go; but on reaching the court, I found the doors  closed. So I came here.\"    \"Kneeling! Where were you kneeling?\"    He made a quick gesture in the direction of the galleries.    The detective frowned, perhaps to hide his secret satisfaction.    \"Won't you be a little more definite?\" he asked; then as the man  continued to hesitate he added, but as yet without any appreciable loss  of kindliness: \"Every other person here has been good enough to show us  the exact place he was occupying at that serious moment. I must ask you  to do the same; it is only just.\"    Was the look this called up one of fear or of simple repugnance? It might  be either; but the detective was disposed to consider it fear.    \"Will you lead the way?\" he pursued. \"I shall be glad to follow.\"    A glance of extreme reproach; then these words, uttered with painful  intensity:    \"You want me to go back there--where I saw--where I can see again--_I  cannot_. I'm not well. I suffer. You will excuse me. You will allow me to  say what I have to say, _here_.\"    \"I'm sorry, but I cannot do that. The others have gone without question  to their places; why should not you?\"    \"Because----\" The word came brokenly and was followed by silence. Then,  seeing the hopelessness of contending with police authority, he cast  another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#9)"],[1,"the  sea life will be of great benefit to you, and have requested him to  keep a tight hand over you, and let me know occasionally how you are  going on. I have told him that your position as my heir will, to a very  large extent, depend upon his reports, and have asked him, in the name  of our old friendship, to be perfectly frank and open in them with me.  I have said 'he is my eldest nephew, but I have others who will take  his place, if he is unworthy of the position, and although I should be  sorry if he should be found wanting, I will commit the interests of all  the tenants and people on my estate to no one who is not, in every  respect, an honourable gentleman.'    \"That will do, sir. You need not remain longer in your room, but you  will not leave the grounds. My friend's ship is at Portsmouth at  present, and doubtless I shall receive an answer in the course of a few  days. Until then, the less we see each other, the more pleasant for us  both.\"    There were few more miserable boys in England than Richard Horton,  during the week which elapsed before the answer to the squire's letter  was received. It cannot be said that, in the true sense of the word, he  was sorry for his fault. He was furious with himself, not because he  had lied, but because of the consequences of the lie. A thousand times  he called himself a fool for having imperilled his position, and risked  being sent back again to the dingy house in London, merely to excuse  himself for being thrashed by a boy smaller than himself. Mad with his  folly, not in having invented the story, but in having neglected to  look round, to assure himself that there were no witnesses who would  contradict it, he wandered disconsolate about the gardens and park,  cursing what he called his fortune.    It was an additional sting to his humiliation, that he knew every  servant in and about the house rejoiced at his discomfiture, and he  imagined that there was a veiled smile of satisfaction, at his bruised  visage and his notorious disgrace with the squire, on the face of every  man he met outside, and of every woman who passed him in the house.    During the whole week he did not venture near the stables, for there he  knew that he had rendered himself specially obnoxious, and there was  nothing for him to do but to saunter listlessly about the garden, until  the day arrived that the letter came granting the squire's request, and  begging that he might be sent off at once, as the vessel would probably  put to sea in a few days.    \"Now, Richard,\" the squire said that evening to him, in a kinder voice  than he had used on the last occasion, \"you understand exactly how we  stand towards each other. That being so, I do not wish to maintain our  present uncomfortable relations. You have had your punishment, and,  unless I hear to the contrary, I shall assume that the punishment has  had its effect. When you return from sea, after your first voyage, you  will come home here as if nothing had happened, and this business need  never be alluded to between us. If you turn out as I have hitherto  believed you to be, I shall receive you as warmly as if my opinion of  you had never been shaken.    \"I have requested Captain Sinclair to let me know what is the average  allowance that the midshipmen receive from their parents, and shall see  that you have as much as your messmates. I have also asked him to  kindly allow one of his officers to order you a proper outfit in all  respects, and to have the bill sent in to me. So now, my boy, you will  have a fresh and a fair start, and I trust that you will turn out  everything that I can wish.\"    \"I will try, sir. I will indeed,\" Richard said earnestly; and he spoke  from his heart, for the inheritance was very dear to him, and it would  be a terrible thing indeed to forfeit it.    For two years after Richard Horton's departure, things went on quietly  at Sidmouth. James Walsham continued to make a pet and a playmate of  little Aggie. Her out-of-door life had made her strong and sturdy, and  she was able to accompany him in all his rambles, while, when he was at  work at home preparing fishing lines, making boats, or otherwise  amusing himself, she was content to sit hours quietly beside him,  chattering incessantly, and quite content with an occasional brief  answer to the questions. When he was studying, she too would work at  her lessons; and however much she might be puzzled over these, she  would never disturb him by asking him questions when so engaged.    She was an intelligent child, and the hour's lesson, morning and  afternoon, soon grew into two. She was eager to learn, and rapidly  gained ground on Mrs. Walsham's older pupils. During the two years,  that lady never had cause to regret that she had yielded to the  sergeant's entreaties. Aggie was no trouble in the house, which she  brightened with her childish laughter and merry talk; and her  companionship, James's mother could not but think, did the boy much  good. It softened his manner, and, although he still often went out  with the fishermen, he was no longer thrown entirely for companionship  upon the boys on the beach.    The sergeant came and went, seldom being more than two months without  paying a visit to Sidmouth. The child was always delighted to see her  grandfather, and James took to him greatly, and liked nothing better  than to stroll up with him to a sheltered spot on the hillside, where  he would throw himself down on the grass, while the sergeant smoked his  pipe and told him stories of his travels and adventures, and Aggie ran  about looking for wildflowers, or occasionally sat down, for a while,  to listen also.    The squire lived his usual lonely life up at the Hall. The absence of  his nephew, whose ship had sailed for a foreign station, was a relief  rather than otherwise to him. It had, from the first, been a painful  effort to him to regard this boy as his heir, and he had only done it  when heartsick from a long and fruitless search for one who would have  been nearer and dearer to him. Nor had he ever taken to the lad  personally. The squire felt that there was not the ring of true metal  in him. The careless way in which he spoke of his parents showed a want  of heart; and although his uncle was ignorant how much the boy made  himself disliked in the household, he was conscious, himself, of a  certain antipathy for him, which led him to see as little of him as  possible.    The two years, for which the sergeant had placed his grandchild with  Mrs. Walsham, came to an end. That he did not intend to continue the  arrangement, she judged from something he said on the occasion of his  last visit, two months before the time was up, but he gave no hint as  to what he intended to do with her.    In those weeks Mrs. Walsham frequently thought the matter over. That  the sergeant had plans for the child she could hardly doubt. The child  herself had told her that she knew of no other relations than her  grandfather, and yet he could hardly intend to take her about with him,  after placing her for two years in a comfortable home. She was but  seven years old now--far too young to go out into a place as servant  girl in a farm house. She doubted not that the sergeant had expended  the whole of his savings, and she thought him foolish in not having  kept her with him for some little time longer, or, if he could not do  that, he might have placed her with some honest people, who would have  kept her for the sum he had paid until she was old enough to take a  place as a nurse girl.    And yet, while she argued thus, Mrs. Walsham felt that the old showman  had not acted without weighing the whole matter. There must be  something in it which she did not understand. In fact, he had said so  when he placed the child with her.    As the time approached, she became more worried at the thought of Aggie  leaving her. The little one had wound herself very closely round her  heart. The expense of keeping her was small indeed, the cost of her  food next to nothing; while the extra girl, whom Mrs. Walsham had taken  on when she first came, had been retained but a very short time,  James's constant companionship with her rendering the keeping of a  nurse altogether unnecessary.    At last she made up her mind that she would offer to keep her on  without pay. She and James would miss her companionship sorely, and it  could not be considered an extravagance, since the money she had  received for her would pay for the cost of her keep for years to come.  When Mrs. Walsham's mind was once made up, her only fear was that these  mysterious plans of the sergeant would not allow him to leave Aggie  with her.    Punctual to the day, Sergeant Wilks arrived, and after a little talk in  the parlour, as usual, with James and Aggie present, he formally  requested the favour of a conversation with Mrs. Walsham alone.    \"Take Aggie for a walk, James. Do not stay out above three quarters of  an hour, as your tea will be ready for you then.\"    \"You must have wondered, ma'am, a good deal,\" the sergeant began when  they were alone, \"why I, who get my living by travelling the country  with a peep show, wished to place my grandchild in a position above  her, and to have her taught to be a little lady. It is time now that I  should tell you. Aggie is my granddaughter, but she is the  granddaughter, too, of Squire Linthorne up at the Hall.\"    \"Bless me!\" Mrs. Walsham ejaculated, too astonished for any further  expression of her feelings.    \"Yes, ma'am, she is the daughter of the squire's son Herbert, who  married my daughter Cissie.\"    \"Dear me, dear me,\" Mrs. Walsham said, \"what an extraordinary thing! Of  course I remember Herbert Linthorne, a handsome, pleasant young fellow.  He was on bad terms, as everyone heard, eight years ago, with his  father, because he married somebody beneath--I mean somebody of whom  the squire did not approve. A year afterwards, we heard"]]]
