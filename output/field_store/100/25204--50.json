Fashions in china decoration are  not fixed; the fancy of the hour is constantly changing, but a matched  set is eminently proper for the dinner table, leaving the \"harlequin\"  china for luncheons and teas.  In the latter style the aim is to have  no two pieces alike in decoration, or at least, to permit an unlimited  variety; a fashion that is very convenient when large quantities of  dishes are liable to be needed.  But for a dinner served in orderly  sequence, the orderly correspondence of a handsome \"set\" seems more in  keeping.  But even with this, the harlequin idea may come in with the  dessert; fruit plates, ice-cream sets, after-dinner coffees, etc., may  display any number of fantasies in shape and coloring.    Artistic glassware is a very handsome feature of table furnishing.  Carafes and goblets for water are always needed at dinner; wine  glasses, possibly; and the serving of fruits and bon-bons gives  opportunity to display the most brilliant cut-glass, or its  comparatively inexpensive substitutes, which are scarcely less pretty  in effect.  Fine glass is infinitely more elegant than common  plated-ware, and though more liable to breakage is less trouble to keep  in order.    The best dinner-knife is of steel, of good quality, with handle of  ivory, ebony, or silver.  Silver-plated knives are much used; they do  not discolor so readily as steel, and are easily kept polished.  They  answer the purpose for luncheon, but they rarely have edge enough to be  really serviceable at dinner or breakfast.    Many people who own solid silverware store it away in bank vaults and  use its _fac simile_ in quadruple plate, and thus escape the constant  dread of a possible burglar.  For the sense of security that it gives,  one may value the finest quality of plated ware, but it should be  inconspicuous in style and not too profuse in quantity, since its  utility, rather than its commercial value, should be suggested.  Any  ostentation in the use of plated ware is vulgar.  But one may take a  pride and satisfaction in the possession of solid silver.  Every  ambitious housekeeper will devise ways of securing, little by little,  if not all at once, a neat collection of solid spoons and forks.  The  simplest table takes on dignity when graced with these \"sterling\"  accompaniments.  The fancy for collecting \"souvenir\" spoons, one at a  time, suggests a way to secure a valuable lot of spoons without feeling  the burden of the expense.  Yet, on the other hand, these spoons are  much more expensive than equally good plain silver, the extra price  being paid for the \"idea;\" but the expenditure is worth while to those  who value historical associations.  One may find in the silver-basket  salient reminders of all important epochs in our national life, a sort  of primer of United States history, to say nothing of the innumerable  \"souvenirs\" of Europe.  Its subtle testimony to the intelligent taste  of its owner gives the souvenir collection its chief \"touch of  elegance.\"    The towering \"castor,\" once the central glory of the dinner table, is  out of style.  The condiments are left on the sideboard, and handed  from there in case any dish requires them, the supposition being that,  as a rule, the several dishes are properly seasoned before they are  served.  Individual salt-cellars are placed on the table, and may be  accompanied with salt spoons; if these are omitted, it is understood  that the salt-cellar is emptied and refilled each time that it is used.  On the family dinner-table the condiment line is not so severely drawn;  vinegar in cut-glass cruets, mustard in Satsuma pots, and individual  \"peppers\"--in silver, china, or glass, and of quaint designs--are  convenient and allowable.    A table covered with white damask, overlaid with sparkling china and  cut-glass, and reflecting the white light of polished silver, is a  pretty but lifeless sight.  Add one magic touch--the centre-piece of  flowers--and the crystallized beauty wakes to organic life.    In arranging the modern dinner-table, when the service is to be _a la  Russe_, floral decorations are almost indispensable.  Without something  attractive for the eye to rest upon, the desert stretch of linen looks  like the white ghost of famine mocking the feast.    The shape of the table, the available space, and the nature of the  occasion decide the quantity and distribution of the flowers.  It is a  matter in which wide latitude is given to individual taste and  ingenuity, original designs and odd conceits being always in order,  subject only to the law of appropriateness.    For a square or extra wide table a large centre-piece, either round or  oblong, is usually chosen, with endless varieties in its component  arrangement.  It may be low and flat, like a floral mat, in the middle  of the table, or it may be a lofty _epergne_, or an inter-lacing of  delicate vine-wreathed arches, or a single basket of feathery  maidenhair fern--in fact, anything that is pretty and which the  inspiration of the moment may suggest.  In early autumn, in country  homes or in suburban villas, nothing is more effective than masses of  golden-rod and purple asters, gathered by the hostess or her guests  during their afternoon drive, and all the more satisfactory because of  the pleasure taken in their impromptu arrangement.  Wild flowers should  be neatly trimmed and symmetrically grouped to avoid a ragged or weedy  appearance.    Fortunately, even quite elaborate floral decorations need not be  expensive.  Nature has bestowed some of her choicest touches upon the  lilies of the field, and an artistic eye discerns their possibilities.  At the same time, art in floriculture has produced marvels, and those  who can afford it may revel in mammoth roses and rare orchids, lilies  of the valley in November, and red clovers in January, if it please  them to pay the florist's bill for the same.    For narrow \"extension\" tables, slender vases ranged at intervals may be  the most convenient disposition of the flowers; or, if the ends of the  table are not occupied, a broad, low basket may stand at each end, with  a tall, slender vase in the middle of the table.    On choice occasions a handsome centre-piece may be, for example, a  large bowl of La France roses, with small bundles of the same (groups  of three are pretty), tied with ribbon of the same hue, laid by each  plate.  Any other single flower may be disposed similarly, or variety  may rule, and no two floral \"favors\" be alike, in which case it is a  delicate compliment to give to each guest a flower known to be a  favorite, or one that seems especially appropriate--a lily to Lilian, a  daisy to Marguerite, etc.  These little marks of thoughtfulness never  fail to be appreciated, and add much to the grace of entertaining.    An elaborate centre-piece may stand upon a rich velvet mat, or on a  flat mirror provided for the purpose.  The latter is a clever idea for  a centre-piece of pond-lilies or other aquatic plants, simulating a  miniature lake, its edges fringed with moss or ferns.      THE FORMAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE DINNER-TABLE    The mat is first adjusted upon the table, and the table-cloth smoothly  and evenly laid over it.  The cloth should fall about half-way to the  floor all around.    The floral accessories are then put in place; and also the fruits and  bon-bons, which may be commingled with the flowers in working out a  decorative design, or they may be placed, in ornamental dishes, at the  four corners of a wide table, to balance the flowers in the centre; or,  they may be arranged along the middle of a long table.  For fruit,  silver-gilt baskets, or _epergnes_ of glass are especially pretty.  The  fruit may later constitute a part of the dessert, or may be merely  ornamental in its office.  Carafes containing iced water are placed  here and there on the table, at convenient points.    The next step is the laying of the covers; a cover signifying the place  prepared for one person.  For a dinner in courses a cover consists of a  small plate (on which to set the oyster plate), two large knives, three  large forks (for the roast, the game, and _entrees_), one small knife  and fork (for the fish), one tablespoon (for the soup), one  oyster-fork.  The knives and forks are laid at the right and left of  the plate, the oyster-fork and the spoon being conveniently to hand.  A  glass goblet for water is set at the right, about eight inches from the  edge of the table; if wine is to be served the requisite glasses are  grouped about the water goblet.    The napkin is folded square, with one fold turned back to inclose a  thick piece of bread; or, the napkin may be folded into a triangle that  will stand upright, holding the bread within its folds.  This is the  only way in which bread is put on the dinner-table, though a plate of  bread is on the sideboard to be handed to those who require a second  piece.  It is entirely proper to ask for it, when desired.  Butter is  not usually placed on the dinner-table, but is handed from the  sideboard if the _menu_ includes dishes that require it; as, sweet  corn, sweet potatoes, etc.  Small butter-plates are included in the  \"cover\" in such cases.    The oysters, which form the initial course, are usually on the table  before the guests take their places.  A majolica plate, containing four  or six of the bivalves with a bit of lemon in the midst, is placed at  each cover; or, oyster cocktails may be served.  The soup tureen and  plates are brought in to the side table.  All is now in readiness.      THE ARRIVAL OF GUESTS--MEANWHILE    While these preparations have been going on in the dining-room, the  guests have been assembling in the drawing-room.  It is proper to  arrive from five to fifteen minutes before the hour mentioned in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#9)"],[1,"so save her from  further explanation. In this Grace was right. Miriam was trapped at  last. She deliberately turned and walked away without a word.    \"Come on, girls,\" they heard her call to the others, \"let's waste no  more time on them.\" When all was quiet the seven intriguers slipped down  the fire escape and disappeared in the darkness--safely escaping  discovery.          CHAPTER VII    ALL HALLOWE'EN      \"Anne,\" called a chorus of boys' and girls' voices, \"come out and have  some fun. Have you forgotten it's Hallowe'en?\"    The door of the Pierson cottage opened and Anne appeared on the  threshhold.    \"I can't,\" she answered; \"I must study to-night.\"    \"Oh, bother lessons!\" exclaimed Grace Harlowe. \"Skip them, for once, and  join the crowd. We are going Hallowe'ening. Mother allowed it because  David Nesbit and Reddy Brooks are along to look after us.\"    Anne looked longingly at the little company.    \"I'll come,\" she sighed, \"although it was my algebra I was working on.  You know Miss Leece hates me, and, if I slip up, she'll be much harder  than any of the other teachers.\"    \"Hang Miss Leece!\" said David promptly.    \"Well, let's hang her, then,\" exclaimed Nora. \"Let's dress her up and  hang her on a limb of a tree.\"    \"What do you mean by 'hang' her?\" asked Grace, while Anne went in to put  on her hat and coat.    \"Don't you know?\" replied Nora. \"You stuff an old dress full of hay and  paper, make a head out of any old thing, put a hat on it, and there you  have her mighty fine.\"    \"That's an old stunt, Nora,\" observed David. \"Let's have something more  improved and up-to-date. Suppose, for instance, we use Marian's  Jack-o'-lantern for the head. I'll put some little electric bulbs in the  eye holes and attach them to a battery so that we can turn her eyes off  and on. And we'll ride her on a broomstick in good style.\"    \"Only, nobody must know it's Miss Leece whose being effigied,\" urged  Grace. \"This must be merely for our own private satisfaction. Everybody  promise not to tell.\"    Everybody promised; so, with Anne safely in tow, they started for  Jessica's house to make the figure. Here they were not likely to be  interrupted. Jessica's mother was dead and her father spent most of his  evenings in his library.    Half a broomstick, with a small pumpkin attached to one end, formed the  framework of Miss Leece's effigy. A cross beam gave a human touch to the  shoulders and with the skeleton ready, the business of stuffing an old  ulster and hanging it over the figure was simple. Tiny electric bulbs  were placed in the eyes and a bonnet tied on the head with a green veil  floating behind. Miss Leece, Nora insisted, always wore one growing out  of her left ear. There was nothing left to do now, but to place the  figure in a legless chair that had been nailed to two poles, and the  procession was ready.    \"She's a very fine lady,\" cried Grace, running ahead to get the effect  of the absurd lopsided figure whose eyes glared and went out  alternately. \"I wish the real Miss L. could see herself now. She would  know exactly what she looks like when she glares at poor little Anne in  class.\"    \"Yes, Anne,\" said David, \"this shall be your party. We are going to give  you satisfaction for your wrongs in the only way that lies in our  power.\"    \"Oh, I don't really mind her,\" replied Anne, \"only I'm afraid she'll  catch me unprepared, some day, and then I _will_ get it in earnest.\"    \"It's a perfect outrage,\" exclaimed Grace. \"Miss Leece is so cruel to  little Anne, David, that it makes my blood boil. I sometimes think she  is trying to make Anne lose the freshman prize.\"    \"The old Hessian!\" cried David, who was on a sort of rampage that  evening. \"What shall I do to her, Anne? Give her an electric shock?\" and  he pressed the electric button rapidly up and down, which made the eyes  glare hideously and go out several times in succession.    In a town the size of Oakdale strolling parties of boys and girls, on  Hallowe'en night, made a not unusual sight, so when our young people  paraded boldly down the main street, singing and blowing horns, nothing  was thought of it. What they were doing might be considered exceedingly  out of place by a few straightlaced persons, but boys and girls will  have their fun, even if it must sometimes be at the expense of other  people.    Certainly Miss Leece was the most unpopular teacher ever employed in the  High School as far back as memory could reach. She was cruel, strict and  sharp-tongued. Often her violent, unrestrained temper got the better of  her in the class room; then she gave an exhibition that was not good for  young girls to see. Anne, especially, was the victim of her rages--poor  little Anne who never missed a lesson and studied twice as hard as the  other girls. Miss Leece had but one weakness, apparently, and that was  Miriam Nesbit.    Twice had the faculty convened in secret session to consider Miss  Leece's case, but it had been decided to keep her through the year at  least, since she was engaged by contract and was moreover an excellent  instructor in mathematics.    So, it was no wonder that even this early in the school year, she was  the object of dislike to the High School girls. But could our girls have  foreseen what the evening's fun would bring forth, they would never have  been so reckless in carrying the effigy about town.    \"Suppose we take her across the square,\" cried Reddy; \"then over the  bridge to the old graveyard and hang her on the limb of the apple tree  just outside the wall?\"    Off they started, singing at the tops of their voices:        Hang a mean teacher on a sour apple tree,      Hang a mean teacher on a sour apple tree.    When they reached the center of the public square, where a big electric  light shed its rays, who should spring out of the shadows, from nowhere  apparently, but Miss Leece herself? Nothing escaped her sharp ears and  her cold blue eyes; neither words of the song nor the figure in detail,  green veil and all; nor Anne Pierson, who happened to be standing quite  near the effigy at the moment.    And what was worse, and still more incriminating to the guilty  merrymakers, the moment they caught sight of her they stopped singing.  The eyes in the pumpkin suddenly lost their glare, and a silent  procession wound its way hurriedly from the square.    \"Good heavens!\" cried Grace. \"Why did we stop the song? If we had only  gone right ahead, it wouldn't have looked half as bad.\"    \"It was a mistake,\" admitted David, gravely, \"especially as she seemed  to have seen Anne first of all. Anne, if she walks into you to-morrow  morning, you can just lay the blame on me, do you hear? I got up the  whole party and I'm willing to stand for it.\"    \"No, no,\" cried Anne. \"That wouldn't be fair, David. I couldn't think of  doing that.\"    \"Well, you are not to get the blame, at any rate,\" said David, \"if I  have to go up and make a confession to the principal herself.\"    \"Let's go and hang her now, anyhow,\" cried Reddy. \"We'll take no  half-way measures with old Queen Bess.\"    But somehow the spice of the adventure seemed to have gone out of it.    \"It really would be dangerous now,\" said Grace. \"She would be certain to  hear of it and make it worse for all of us.\"    \"Why not burn her,\" put in Nora, who was afraid of nothing and had often  looked at the scolding teacher with such cold, laughing eyes, that even  Miss Leece was disconcerted.    \"Good!\" cried several of the others. \"We will take her down below the  bridge and burn her as a witch.\"    No one objected to this, since the ashes of the effigy would tell no  tales. Once more they started singing: \"Merrily we roll along!\" as they  marched out of the village, crossed the bridge over the little river and  finally paused on the bank below.    \"Plant the pole in deep,\" said David, \"so she won't topple, and fix her  up to suit yourselves, girls, while we get the fagots.\"    The boys began to search about for dried sticks and twigs, while the  girls were arranging the figure for her funeral pyre.    Suddenly, there was a wild war whoop. A crowd of boys dashed out of a  thicket near by, each one carrying a lighted Jack-o'-lantern on top of a  pole, and surrounded the effigy of the teacher.    \"Help!\" cried the girls, trying to defend the absurd thing from the  attack, but they were too late. One of the boys seized the pole and  rushed off in the darkness.    Miss Leece, in effigy, had been kidnapped in an instant, before David  and his friends had had time to realize what had happened.    \"Which way did they go?\" he asked breathlessly.    \"Through the thicket,\" cried Grace.    And the whole crowd dashed after the kidnappers. It was great fun for  everybody except Anne, who was too tired to keep up the chase for long,  and was soon lagging behind the others. David saw her and turned back.    \"You are too little for all this junketing, Anne,\" he said kindly.  \"Suppose I take you home? Shall I?\"    \"I wish you would, David,\" answered the girl. \"I'm just about ready to  drop, I'm so tired.\"    Taking her arm, he helped her over the ruts and rough places, until they  finally emerged from the wood and started on the road to town.    There were many other Hallowe'en parties out that night; singing and  laughing was heard in every direction.    \"It's like a play,\" said Anne, \"only everything is behind the scenes.  Don't think I haven't enjoyed it, David, just because I got tired. I  never played with boys and girls of my own age before. What fun it is!\"    \"Isn't it?\" replied the young man, \"I love to get out, once in a while,  and have a good time like this. I find I can work all the better after  it's over.\"    Presently the others caught up with them, breathless and laughing.    \"Miss Leece is stolen,\" cried Grace, \"before ever she was hanged or  burned. I do wonder what they'll do with her.\"    \"Oh, leave her in the woods,\" responded Reddy, \"to scare the "]]]
