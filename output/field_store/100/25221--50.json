Duplay was a carpenter, a  sworn follower of Robespierre, and the whole family cherished their  guest as if he had been a son and a brother. Between him and the eldest  daughter of the house there grew up a more tender sentiment, and  Robespierre looked forward to the joys of the hearth, so soon as his  country should be delivered from the oppressors without and the traitors  within.    Eagerly as Robespierre delighted in his popularity, he intended it to  be a force and not a decoration. An occasion of testing his influence  arose in the winter of 1791. The situation had become more and more  difficult. The court was more disloyal and more perverse, as its hopes  that the nightmare would come to an end became fainter. In the summer of  1791, the German Emperor, the King of Prussia, and minor champions of  retrograde causes issued the famous Declaration of Pilnitz. The menace  of intervention was the one element needed to make the position of the  monarchy desperate. It roused France to fever heat. For along with the  foreign kings were the French princes of the blood and the French  nobles. In the spring of 1792, the Assembly forced the King to declare  war against Austria. Robespierre, in spite of the strong tide of warlike  feeling, led the Jacobin opposition to the war. This is one of the most  sagacious acts of his career, for the hazards of the conflict were  terrible. If the foreigners and the emigrant nobles were victorious, all  that the Revolution had won would be instantly and irretrievably lost.  If, on the other hand, the French armies were victorious, one of two  disasters might follow. Either the troops might become a weapon in the  hands of the court and the reactionary party, for the suppression of all  the progressive parties alike; or else their general might make himself  supreme. Robespierre divined, what the Girondins did not, that Narbonne  and the court, in accepting the cry for war, were secretly designing,  first, to crush the faction of emigrant nobles, then to make the King  popular at home, and thus finally to construct a strong royalist army.  The Constitutional party in the Legislative Assembly had the same ideas  as Narbonne. The Girondins sought war; first, from a genuine, if not a  profoundly wise, enthusiasm for liberty, which they would fain have  spread all over the world; and next, because they thought that war would  increase their popularity, and give them decisive control of the  situation.    The first effect of the war declared in April 1792 was to shake down the  throne. Operations had no sooner begun than the King became an object of  bitter and amply warranted suspicion. Neither the leaders nor the people  had forgotten his flight a year before to place himself at the head of  the foreign invaders, nor the letter that he had left behind him for the  National Assembly, protesting against all that had been done. They were  again reminded of what short shrift they might expect if the King's  friends should come back. The Duke of Brunswick at the head of the  foreign army set out on his march, and issued his famous proclamation to  the inhabitants of France. He demanded immediate and unconditional  submission; he threatened with fire and sword every town, village, or  hamlet, that should dare to defend itself; and finally, he swore that if  the smallest violence or insult were done to the King or his family, the  city of Paris should be handed over to military execution and absolute  destruction. This insensate document bears marks in every line of the  implacable hate and burning thirst for revenge that consumed the  aristocratic refugees. Only civil war can awaken such rage as  Brunswick's manifesto betrayed. It was drawn up by the French nobles at  Coblenz. He merely signed it. The reply to it was the memorable  insurrection of the Tenth of August 1792. The King was thrown into  prison, and the Legislative Assembly made way for the National  Convention.    Robespierre's part in the great rising of August was only secondary.  Only a few weeks before he had started a journal and written articles in  a constitutional sense. M. d'Hericault believes a story that  Robespierre's aim in this had been to have himself accepted as tutor for  the young Dauphin. It is impossible to prove a negative, but we find  great difficulty in believing that such a post could ever have been an  object of Robespierre's ambition. Now and always he showed a rather  singular preference for the substance of power over its glitter. He was  vain and an egoist, but in spite of this, and in spite of his passion  for empty phrases, he was not without a sense of reality.    The insurrection of the 10th of August, however, was the idea, not of  Robespierre, but of a more commanding personage, who now became one of  the foremost of the Jacobin chiefs. De Maistre, that ardent champion of  reaction, found a striking argument for the presence of the divine hand  in the Revolution, in the intense mediocrity of the revolutionary  leaders. How could such men, he asked, have achieved such results, if  they had not been instruments of the directing will of heaven? Danton at  any rate is above this caustic criticism. Danton was of the Herculean  type of a Luther, though without Luther's deep vision of spiritual  things; or a Chatham, though without Chatham's august majesty of life;  or a Cromwell, though without Cromwell's calm steadfastness of patriotic  purpose. His visage and port seemed to declare his character: dark  overhanging brows; eyes that had the gleam of lightning; a savage mouth;  an immense head; the voice of a Stentor. Madame Roland pictured him as a  fiercer Sardanapalus. Artists called him Jove the Thunderer. His enemies  saw in him the Satan of the Paradise Lost. He was no moral regenerator;  the difference between him and Robespierre is typified in Danton's  version of an old saying, that he who hates vices hates men. He was not  free from that careless life-contemning desperation, which sometimes  belongs to forcible natures. Danton cannot be called noble, because  nobility implies a purity, an elevation, and a kind of seriousness which  were not his. He was too heedless of his good name, and too blind to the  truth that though right and wrong may be near neighbours, yet the line  that separates them is of an awful sacredness. If Robespierre passed for  a hypocrite by reason of his scruple, Danton seemed a desperado by his  airs of 'immoral thoughtlessness.' But the world forgives much to a  royal size, and Danton was one of the men who strike deep notes. He had  that largeness of motive, fulness of nature, and capaciousness of mind,  which will always redeem a multitude of infirmities.    Though the author of some of the most tremendous and far-sounding  phrases of an epoch that was only too rich in them, yet phrases had no  empire over him; he was their master, not their dupe. Of all the men who  succeeded Mirabeau as directors of the unchained forces, we feel that  Danton alone was in his true element. Action, which poisoned the blood  of such men as Robespierre, and drove such men as Vergniaud out of their  senses with exaltation, was to Danton his native sphere. When France was  for a moment discouraged, it was he who nerved her to new effort by the  electrifying cry, '_We must dare, and again dare, and without end  dare!_' If his rivals or his friends seemed too intent on trifles, too  apt to confound side issues with the central aim of the battle, Danton  was ever ready to urge them to take a juster measure:--'_When the  edifice is all ablaze, I take little heed of the knaves who are  pilfering the household goods; I rush to put out the flames._' When base  egoism was compromising a cause more priceless than the personality of  any man, it was Danton who made them ashamed by the soul-inspiring  exclamation, '_Let my name be blotted out and my memory perish, if only  France may be free._' The Girondins denounced the popular clubs of Paris  as hives of lawlessness and outrage. Danton warned them that it were  wiser to go to these seething societies and to guide them, than to waste  breath in futile denunciation. 'A nation in revolution,' he cried to  them, in a superb figure, 'is like the bronze boiling and foaming and  purifying itself in the cauldron. Not yet is the statue of Liberty cast.  Fiercely boils the metal; have an eye on the furnace, or the flame will  surely scorch you.' If there was murderous work below the hatches, that  was all the more reason why the steersman should keep his hand strong  and ready on the wheel, with an eye quick for each new drift in the  hurricane, and each new set in the raging currents. This is ever the  figure under which one conceives Danton--a Titanic shape doing battle  with the fury of the seas, yielding while flood upon flood sweeps wildly  over him, and then with unshaken foothold and undaunted front once more  surveying the waste of waters, and striving with dexterous energy to  force the straining vessel over the waters of the bar.    La Fayette had called the huge giant of popular force from its squalid  lurking-places, and now he trembled before its presence, and fled from  it shrieking, with averted hands. Marat thrust swords into the giant's  half-unwilling grasp, and plied him with bloody incitement to slay hip  and thigh, and so filled the land with a horror that has not faded from  out of men's minds to this day. Danton instantly discerned that the  problem was to preserve revolutionary energy, and still to persuade the  insurgent forces to retire once more within their boundaries.  Robespierre discerned this too, but he was paralysed and bewildered by  his own principles, as the convinced doctrinaire is so apt to be amid  the perplexities of practice. The teaching of Rousseau was ever pouring  like thin smoke among his ideas, and clouding "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#9)"],[1,"foot down in the middle and began to sink. As fast  as he tried to pull out one foot, the other sank deeper, until at last  he was swallowed up in the black slime--and that was the end of him.          THE THREE BEARS    [Illustration]      There were once three bears who lived together in a little house in the  middle of a wood. One of them was a Little, Small, Wee Bear; one was a  Middle-Sized Bear; and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.    And they each had a pot to eat their porridge from: a little pot for the  Little, Small, Wee Bear; a middle-sized pot for the Middle-Sized Bear;  and a great big pot for the Great, Huge Bear.    And they each had a chair to sit on: a little chair for the Little,  Small, Wee Bear; a middle-sized chair for the Middle-Sized Bear; and a  great big chair for the Great, Huge Bear.    And they each had a bed to sleep in: a little bed for the Little, Small,  Wee Bear; a middle-sized bed for the Middle-Sized Bear; and a great big  bed for the Great, Huge Bear.    [Illustration]    One day they made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into  their porridge-pots, and then went out in the wood for a walk while the  porridge for their breakfast was cooling. And while they were out  walking, a little Old Woman came to the house in the wood and peeped  inside.    First she peeped through the keyhole; then she peeped through the  window. Then she lifted the latch and peeped through the doorway; and,  seeing nobody in the house, she walked in. And when she saw the porridge  cooling on the table she was very pleased, for she had walked a long  way, and was getting hungry.    So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, but that was  too hot. Then she tasted the porridge of the Middle-Sized Bear, but that  was too cold. And then she tasted the porridge of the Little, Small, Wee  Bear, and that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right. And  she liked it so much that she ate it all up!    Then the little Old Woman sat down in the chair of the Great, Huge  Bear, but that was too hard. Then she sat down in the chair of the  Middle-Sized Bear, but that was too soft. Then she sat down in the  chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither too hard  nor too soft, but just right. And she liked it so much that she sat  in it until suddenly the bottom came out, and she fell down plump  upon the ground.    Then the little Old Woman went upstairs into the bedroom, where the  three Bears slept. And first she lay down on the bed of the Great, Huge  Bear, but that was too high at the head for her. Then she lay down on  the bed of the Middle-Sized Bear, but that was too high at the foot for  her. So then she lay down on the bed of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and  that was neither too high at the head nor too high at the foot, but just  right. And she liked it so much that she covered herself up and lay  there till she fell fast asleep!    [Illustration]    By and by the three Bears came home to breakfast. Now, the little Old  Woman had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear standing in his  porridge pot.        \"=Somebody has been at my porridge!=\"    said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And when the Middle-Sized Bear looked, she saw that the spoon was  standing in her porridge-pot too.        \"=Somebody has been at my porridge!=\"    said the Middle-Sized Bear in her middle-sized voice.    Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked, and there was the spoon in  his porridge-pot; but the porridge was all gone.        \"=Somebody has been at my porridge and has eaten it all up!=\"    said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.    [Illustration]    Then the three Bears began to look about them. Now, the little Old Woman  had not put the hard cushion straight after she had sat in the chair of  the Great, Huge Bear.        \"=Somebody has been sitting in my chair!=\"    said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And the little Old Woman had squashed the soft cushion of the  Middle-Sized Bear.        \"=Somebody has been sitting in my chair!=\"    said the Middle-Sized Bear, in her middle-sized voice.    And you know what the little Old Woman had done to the third chair.        \"=Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sat the bottom out!=\"    said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.    Then the three Bears went upstairs into their bedroom. Now, the little  Old Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear out of its  place.        \"=Somebody has been lying in my bed!=\"    said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And the little Old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle-Sized Bear  out of its place.        \"=Somebody has been lying in my bed!=\"    said the Middle-Sized Bear, in her middle-sized voice.    And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was  the bolster in its place, and the pillow in its place upon the bolster;  and upon the pillow was the little Old Woman's head, which was not in  its place, for she had no business there at all.        \"=Somebody has been lying in my bed--and here she is!=\"    cried the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.    [Illustration]    The little Old Woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff  voice of the Great, Huge Bear, but she was so fast asleep that it seemed  to her no more than the roaring of the wind, or the rumbling of thunder.  And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-Sized Bear, but  it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when  she heard the little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear,  it was so sharp and shrill that it woke her up at once. Up she started,  and when she saw the three Bears, on one side of the bed, she tumbled  out at the other, jumped out of the window and ran away through the wood  to her own home. And the three Bears never saw anything more of her.          THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL      It was dreadfully cold, it was snowing fast, and almost dark; the  evening--the last evening of the Old Year--was drawing in. But cold and  dark as it was, a poor little girl, with bare head and feet, was still  wandering about the streets. When she left her home she had slippers on,  but they were much too large for her--indeed, really, they belonged to  her mother--and had dropped off her feet while she was running very fast  across the road, to get out of the way of two carriages. One of the  slippers was not to be found; the other had been snatched up by a little  boy, who ran off with it thinking it might serve him as a doll's cradle.    [Illustration]    So the little girl now walked on, her bare feet quite red and blue with  the cold. She carried a small bundle of matches in her hand, and a good  many more in her tattered apron. No one had bought any of them the  livelong day--no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold  and hunger she crept on, the picture of sorrow; poor little child!    The snowflakes fell on her long fair hair, which curled in such pretty  ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, nor  of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor  of roast goose reached her from several houses. It was New Year's Eve,  and it was of this that she thought.    In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the  other, she sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in  vain--she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no  matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat  her. Besides her home was almost as cold as the street--it was an attic;  and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up  with straw and rags, the wind and snow often came through.    [Illustration]    Her hands were nearly dead with cold; one little match from her bundle  would warm them, perhaps, if she dare light it. She drew one out, and  struck it against the wall. Bravo! it was a bright, warm flame, and she  held her hands over it. It was quite an illumination for that poor  little girl--nay, call it rather a magic taper--for it seemed to her as  though she were sitting before a large iron stove with brass ornaments,  so beautifully blazed the fire within! The child stretched out her feet  to warm them also. Alas! in an instant the flame had died away, the  stove vanished, the little girl sat cold and comfortless, with the  burnt match in her hand.    A second match was struck against the wall. It kindled and blazed, and  wherever its light fell the wall became transparent as a veil--the  little girl could see into the room within. She saw the table spread  with a snow-white damask cloth, whereon were ranged shining china  dishes; the roast goose, stuffed with apples and dried plums, stood at  one end, smoking hot, and--which was pleasantest of all to see-the  goose, with knife and fork still in her breast, jumped down from the  dish, and waddled along the floor right up to the poor child. Then the  match went out, and only the thick, hard wall was beside her.    She kindled a third match. Again up shot the flame. And now she was  sitting under a most beautiful Christmas tree, far larger, and far more  prettily decked out, than the one she had seen last Christmas Eve  through the glass doors of the rich merchant's house. Hundreds of wax  tapers lighted up the green branches, and tiny painted figures, such as  she had seen in the shop windows, looked down from the tree upon her.  The child stretched out her hands towards them in delight, and in that  moment the light of the match was quenched. Still, however, the  Christmas candles burned higher and higher--she beheld them beaming  like stars in heaven. One of them fell, the lights streaming behind  it like a long, fiery tail.
