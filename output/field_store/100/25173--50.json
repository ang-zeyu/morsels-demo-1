How came it there, and why was it there?\"    \"It was 'Kenrick's Greek Exercises,' sir.\"    \"You mean the 'Key,' I suppose?\"    Louis answered in the affirmative.    \"Whose was it?\" asked the doctor, with a countenance more ominous  in its expression.    \"It was the one you took from Harrison, sir,\" replied Louis.    \"Humph! I thought I took it away. Bring it here.\" Louis obeyed,  and the doctor having looked at it, continued, \"Well, you had this  _with your lesson books_, you say. How did it come there?\"    \"One of the boys gave it to me, sir,\" replied Louis.    \"And why did you not put it away?\"    \"I was going, sir;\" and the color rushed into Louis' pale face. \"I did  not use it--and I hope I should not.\"    \"Who left the book?\" asked Dr. Wilkinson.    \"Churchill, sir.\"    \"Call Churchill, Salisbury.\"    Salisbury obeyed; and during his absence a profound silence reigned in  the room, for all the first class were watching the proceedings in deep  interest. Dr. Wilkinson seemed lost in thought; and Louis, in painful  anxiety, scanned the strongly marked countenance of his master, now  wearing its most unpleasing mask, and those of Hamilton and Trevannion,  alternately. Hamilton did not look at him, but bent over a table at  a book, the leaves of which he nervously turned. Trevannion eyed him  haughtily as he leaned in his most graceful attitude against the wall  behind the doctor's chair; and poor Louis read his condemnation in his  eyes, as well as in the faces of most present.    Salisbury at length returned with Churchill, who was the more awe-struck  at the unwonted summons, as he was so low in the school as seldom to have  any business with the principal.    \"Churchill,\" said the doctor, gravely, \"I have sent for you to hear what  is said of you. Now, Louis Mortimer, who gave you this book on the day  Mr. Hamilton discovered it in your possession?\"    \"Churchill, sir,\" replied Louis, in great agitation; \"you did, Churchill,  did you not? Oh! do say you did.\"    \"Hush,\" said the doctor. \"What have you to say against this, Churchill?\"    \"Nothing, sir--I did--I gave it to Louis Mortimer,\" stammered Churchill,  looking from Louis to the doctor, and back again.    \"And how came you to give it to him?\"    Churchill did not reply until the question was repeated, when he  reluctantly said, he had given it to Louis to assist him in his  exercise.    \"Did Mortimer ask you for it?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Did he wish for it?\"    \"No, sir, not that I know of.\"    \"You know, Harry, that I asked you to put it away--did I not?\"  cried Louis.    \"I don't know--yes--I think you did,\" said Churchill, growing very hot.    \"Why did you not put it away?\" asked Dr. Wilkinson.    \"Because I thought he wanted it, please sir.\"    \"But I did not, Harry! I told you I did not,\" said Louis, eagerly.    Dr. Wilkinson desired Louis to be silent, and continued his questions--    \"Did you try to persuade him to use it?\"    Again Churchill paused, and again confessed, most unwillingly, that  he had done so--and received a severe reprimand for his conduct on the  occasion, and a long task to write out which would keep him employed  during the play-hours of that day.    He was then dismissed, and Dr. Wilkinson again addressed himself to  Louis: \"I am glad to find that part of your story is correct; but I  now wish you to explain how my key found its way into the school-room  yesterday, when discovered by Mr. Witworth. The book must have been  deliberately taken out of this room into the school-room. You appear  to have been alone, or nearly so, in the school-room the greater part  of yesterday afternoon, and Mr. Witworth found the book half concealed  by your lesson books while you were writing your exercises.\"    \"I assure you, sir, I did not take it,\" said Louis.    \"Unhappily,\" replied Dr. Wilkinson, \"I cannot take a mere assurance  in the present instance. Had not the case been so palpable, I should  have been bound to believe you until I had had reason to mistrust your  word--but with these facts I _cannot_, Louis;\" and he added, in a very  low tone, so as to be heard only by Louis, who was much nearer to him  than the others, \"Your honor has not always been sacred--beware.\"    His school-fellows wondered what made the red flush mount so furiously  in Louis' forehead, and the tears spring to his eyes. The painful feelings  called forth by his master's speech prevented him from speaking for a few  minutes. He was roused by Dr. Wilkinson saying--    \"The discovery of this Key in your possession would involve your  immediate dismissal from the second class, a sufficient disgrace, but  the matter assumes a far more serious aspect from these assertions of  innocence. If you had not used the book when discovered, it must have  been taken either by you, or another, for use. The question is now,  who took it?\"    \"I did not, sir,\" said Louis, in great alarm.    \"Who did, then? Were any of your class with you?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Was any one with you?\"    Louis paused. A sudden thought flashed across him--a sudden recollection  of seeing that book passed over and slipped among his books; an action he  had taken no notice of at the time, and which had never struck him till  this moment. He now glanced eagerly at Ferrers, and then, in a tremulous  voice, said, \"I remember now, Ferrers put it there--I am almost sure.\"    \"Ferrers!\" exclaimed the young men, with one voice.    \"What humbugging nonsense!\" said Salisbury, in a low tone.    \"Do you hear, Mr. Ferrers?\" said the doctor: \"how came you to put that  Key among Louis Mortimer's books?\"    \"I, sir--I never,\" stammered Ferrers. \"What should I want with it?  What good could I get by it? Is it likely?\"    \"I am not arguing on the possibility of such an event, I simply wish  to know if you did it?\" said the doctor.    \"I, sir--no,\" exclaimed Ferrers, with an air of injured innocence.  \"If I had done it, why did he not accuse me at once, instead of  remembering it all of a sudden?\"    \"Because I only just remembered that I saw you moving something  towards me, and I am _almost_ sure it was that book now--I think  so,\" replied Louis.    \"You'd better be quite sure,\" said Ferrers.    Dr. Wilkinson looked from one to the other, and his look might have made  a less unprincipled youth fear to persist in so horrible a falsehood.    \"Were you learning your lessons in the school-room yesterday afternoon,  Mr. Ferrers, at the same time with Louis Mortimer?\" Ferrers acknowledging  this, Dr. Wilkinson sent for Mr. Witworth, and asked him if he had  observed either Ferrers or Louis go into the study during the afternoon,  and if he knew what each brought out with him. Mr. Witworth replied that  both went in, but he did not know what for.    \"I went in to get an atlas for Ferrers,\" cried Louis, in great agitation.    \"I got the atlas myself, Mortimer, you know,\" said Ferrers.    Louis was quite overcome. He covered his face with his hands, and burst  into tears.    \"This is a sad business,\" said Dr. Wilkinson, very gravely; \"much  worse than I expected--one of you must be giving utterance to the  most frightful untruths. Which of you is it?\"    \"What would Ferrers want with the Key to The Greek Exercises sir?\"  suggested Trevannion, \"unless he wished to do an ill turn to Mortimer,  which you cannot suppose.\"    \"I have hitherto trusted Mr. Ferrers,\" replied Dr. Wilkinson; \"and  am not disposed to withdraw that confidence without sufficient cause.  Mr. Ferrers, on your word of honor, am I to believe your statement?\"    Ferrers turned pale, but the doctor's steady gaze was upon him, and all  his class-fellows awaited his reply--visions of disgrace, contempt, and  scorn were before him, and there was no restraining power from within to  check him, as he hastily replied, \"On my word of honor, sir.\"    \"I must believe you, then, as I can imagine no motive which could  induce you to act dishonorably by this boy, were I to discover that  any one in my school had acted so, his immediate expulsion should be  the consequence.\"    The dead silence that followed the doctor's words struck coldly on the  heart of the guilty coward.    \"Now, Louis Mortimer,\" said the doctor, sternly, \"I wish to give you  another chance of confessing your fault.\"    Louis' thick convulsive sobs only replied to this. After waiting a  few minutes, Dr. Wilkinson said, \"Go now to the little study joining  my dining-room, and wait there till I come: I shall give you half an  hour to consider.\"    Louis left the room, and repaired to the study, where he threw himself  on a chair in a paroxysm of grief, which, for the first quarter of an  hour, admitted of no alleviation: \"He had no character. The doctor had  heard all before. All believed him guilty--and how _could_ Ferrers act  so? How could it ever be found out? And, oh! his dear father and mother,  and his grandfather, would believe it.\"    By degrees the violence of his distress subsided, and he sent up his  tearful petitions to his heavenly Father, till his overloaded heart  felt lightened of some of its sorrow. As he grew calmer, remembrances  of old faults came before him, and he thought of a similar sin of his  own, and how nearly an innocent person had suffered for it--and this  he felt was much easier to bear than the consciousness of having  committed the fault himself; and he remembered the sweet verses in  the first Epistle of St. Peter: \"What glory is it if, when ye be  buffeted for your faults, ye take it patiently; but if when ye do well  and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  For even hereunto ye were called, because Christ also suffered for us,  leaving us an example that we should follow His steps: who did no sin,  neither was guile found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled  not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself  to Him that judgeth righteously,\"--and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#9)"],[1,"the Navajo new  varieties of food plants, and their relations grew very cordial. They  built houses along the base of the canyon walls, and dwelt there for two  or three generations, during which time many of the Asa women were given  to the Navajo, and the descendants of these now constitute a numerous  clan among the Navajo, known as the Kiáini, the High-house people.      [Illustration: Plate X. A small ruin near Moen-kopi.]    The Navajo and the Asa eventually quarreled and the latter returned to  Walpi, but this was after the arrival of the Hano, by whom they found  their old houses occupied. The Asa were taken into the village of Walpi,  being given a vacant strip on the east edge of the mesa, just where the  main trail comes up to the village. The Navajo, Ute, and Apache had  frequently gained entrance to the village by this trail, and to guard it  the Asa built a house group along the edge of the cliff at that point,  immediately overlooking the trail, where some of the people still live;  and the kiva there, now used by the Snake order, belongs to them. There  was a crevice in the rock, with a smooth bottom extending to the edge of  the cliff and deep enough for a ki´koli. A wall was built to close the  outer edge and it was at first intended to build a dwelling house there,  but it was afterward excavated to its present size and made into a kiva,  still called the wikwálhobi, the kiva of the Watchers of the High Place.  The Walpi site becoming crowded, some of the Bear and Lizard people  moved out and built houses on the site of the present Sichumovi; several  Asa families followed them, and after them came some of the Badger  people. The village grew to an extent considerably beyond its present  size, when it was abandoned on account of a malignant plague. After the  plague, and within the present generation, the village was rebuilt--the  old houses being torn down to make the new ones.    After the Asa came the nest group to arrive was the Water family. Their  chief begins the story of their migration in this way:      In the long ago the Snake, Horn, and Eagle people lived here (in    Tusayan), but their corn grew only a span high, and when they sang    for rain the cloud god sent only a thin mist. My people then lived    in the distant Pa-lát Kwá-bi in the South. There was a very bad old    man there, who, when he met any one, would spit in his face, blow    his nose upon him, and rub ordure upon him. He ravished the girls    and did all manner of evil. Baholikonga got angry at this and turned    the world upside down, and water spouted up through the kivas and    through the fireplaces in the houses. The earth was rent in great    chasms, and water covered everything except one narrow ridge of mud;    and across this the serpent deity told all the people to travel.    As they journeyed across, the feet of the bad slipped and they fell    into the dark water, but the good, after many days, reached dry    land. While the water was rising around the village the old people    got on the tops of the houses, for they thought they could not    struggle across with the younger people; but Baholikonga clothed    them with the skins of turkeys, and they spread their wings out and    floated in the air just above the surface of the water, and in this    way they got across. There were saved of our people Water, Corn,    Lizard, Horned Toad, Sand, two families of Rabbit, and Tobacco. The    turkey tail dragged in the water--hence the white on the turkey tail    now. Wearing these turkey-skins is the reason why old people have    dewlaps under the chin like a turkey; it is also the reason why old    people use turkey-feathers at the religious ceremonies.    In the story of the wandering of the Water people, many vague references  are made to various villages in the South, which they constructed or  dwelt in, and to rocks where they carved their totems at temporary  halting places. They dwelt for a long time at Homólobi, where the Sun  people joined them; and probably not long after the latter left the  Water people followed on after them. The largest number of this family  seem to have made their dwellings first at Mashongnavi and Shupaulovi;  but like the Sun people they soon spread to all the villages.    The narrative of part of this journey is thus given by the chief before  quoted:      It occupied 4 years to cross the disrupted country. The kwakwanti (a    warrior order) went ahead of the people and carried seed of corn,    beans, melons, squashes, and cotton. They would plant corn in the    mud at early morning and by noon it was ripe and thus the people    were fed. When they reached solid ground they rested, and then they    built houses. The kwakwanti were always out exploring--sometimes    they were gone as long as four years. Again we would follow them on    long journeys, and halt and build houses and plant. While we were    traveling if a woman became heavy with child we would build her a    house and put plenty of food in it and leave her there, and from    these women sprang the Pima, Maricopa, and other Indians in the    South.      Away in the South, before we crossed the mountains (south of the    Apache country) we built large houses and lived there a long while.    Near these houses is a large rock on which was painted the    rain-clouds of the Water phratry, also a man carrying corn in his    arms; and the other phratries also painted the Lizard and the Rabbit    upon it. While they were living there the kwakwanti made an    expedition far to the north and came in conflict with a hostile    people. They fought day after day, for days and days--they fought by    day only and when night came they separated, each party retiring to    its own ground to rest. One night the cranes came and each crane    took a kwakwanti on his back and brought them back to their people    in the South.      Again all the people traveled north until they came to the Little    Colorado, near San Francisco Mountains, and there they built houses    up and down the river. They also made long ditches to carry the    water from the river to their gardens. After living there a long    while they began to be plagued with swarms of a kind of gnat called    the sand-fly, which bit the children, causing them to swell up and    die. The place becoming unendurable, they were forced again to    resume their travels. Before starting, one of the Rain-women, who    was big with child, was made comfortable in one of the houses on the    mountain. She told her people to leave her, because she knew this    was the place where she was to remain forever. She also told them,    that hereafter whenever they should return to the mountain to hunt    she would provide them with plenty of game. Under her house is a    spring and any sterile woman who drinks of its water will bear    children. The people then began a long journey to reach the summit    of the table land on the north. They camped for rest on one of the    terraces, where there was no water, and they were very tired and    thirsty. Here the women celebrated the rain-feast--they danced for    three days, and on the fourth day the clouds brought heavy rain and    refreshed the people. This event is still commemorated by a circle    of stones at that place. They reached a spring southeast from    Káibitho (Kumás Spring) and there they built a house and lived for    some time. Our people had plenty of rain and cultivated much corn    and some of the Walpi people came to visit us. They told ns that    their rain only came here and there in fine misty sprays, and a    basketful of corn was regarded as a large crop. So they asked us to    come to their land and live with them and finally we consented. When    we got there we found some Eagle people living near the Second Mesa;    our people divided, and part went with the Eagle and have ever since    remained there; but we camped near the First Mesa. It was planting    time and the Walpi celebrated their rain-feast but they brought only    a mere misty drizzle. Then we celebrated our rain-feast and planted.    Great rains and thunder and lightning immediately followed and on    the first day after planting our corn was half an arm's length high;    on the fourth day it was its full height, and in one moon it was    ripe. When we were going up to the village (Walpi was then north of    the gap, probably), we were met by a Bear man who said that our    thunder frightened the women and we must not go near the village.    Then the kwakwanti said, \"Let us leave these people and seek a land    somewhere else,\" but our women said they were tired of travel and    insisted upon our remaining. Then \"Fire-picker\" came down from the    village and told us to come up there and stay, but after we had got    into the village the Walpi women screamed out against us--they    feared our thunder--and so the Walpi turned us away. Then our    people, except those who went to the Second Mesa, traveled to the    northeast as far as the Tsegi (Canyon de Chelly), but I can not tell    whether our people built the louses there. Then they came hack to    this region again and built houses and had much trouble with the    Walpi, but we have lived here ever since.      [Illustration: Plate XI. Masonry on the outer wall of the Fire-House,    detail.]    Groups of the Water people, as already stated, were distributed among  all the villages, although the bulk of them remained at the Middle Mesa;  but it seems that most of the remaining groups subsequently chose to  build their permanent houses at Oraibi. There is no special tradition of  this movement; it is only indicated by this circumstance, that in  addition to the Water families common to every village, there are still  in Oraibi several families of that people which have no representatives  in any of the other villages. At a quite early day Oraibi became a place  of importance, and they tell of being "]]]
