Would you object to putting up your  own car, sir? The garage is under the house, at the rear; just follow the  driveway around. I'll go through the house and meet you there for the  luggage. I'm dreadfully sorry to put you to the trouble, but....\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" Rand comforted him. \"Just as soon do it, myself,  now, anyhow. I expect to be in and out with the car while I'm here, and  I'd better learn the layout of the garage now.\"    \"You may back in, sir, or drive straight in and back out,\" the butler  told him. \"One way's about as easy as the other.\"    Rand returned to his car, driving around the house. A row of doors opened  out of the basement garage; Walters, who must have gone through the house  on the double, was waiting for him. Having what amounted to a conditioned  reflex to park his car so that he could get it out as fast as possible,  he cut over to the right, jockeyed a little, and backed in. There were  already two cars in the garage; a big maroon Packard sedan, and a  sand-colored Packard station-wagon, standing side by side. Rand put  his Lincoln in on the left of the sedan.    \"Bags in the luggage-compartment; it isn't locked,\" he told the butler,  making sure that the glove-compartment, where he had placed the Leech &  Rigdon revolver, was locked. As he got out, the servant went to the rear  of the car and took out the Gladstone and the B-4 bag Rand had brought  with him.    \"If you don't mind entering the house from the rear, sir, we can go up  those steps, there, and through the rear hall,\" the butler suggested,  almost as though he were making some indecent and criminal proposal.    Rand told him to forget the protocol and lead the way. The butler picked  up the bags and conducted him up a short flight of concrete steps to a  landing and a door opening into a short hall above. An open door from  this gave access to a longer hall, stretching to the front of the house,  and there was a third door, closed, which probably led to the servants'  domain.    Rand followed his guide through the open door and into the long hall,  which passed under an arch to extend to the front door. There was a door  on either side, about midway to the arch under the front stairway; the  one on the right was the dining-room, Walters explained, and the one on  the left was the library. He seemed to be still suffering from the  ignominy of admitting a house-guest through any but the main portal.    Emerging into the front hallway, he put down the bags, took Rand's hat  and coat and laid them on top of the luggage, and then went to an open  doorway on the right, standing in it and coughing delicately, before  announcing that Colonel Rand was here.    Gladys Fleming, wearing a pale blue frock, came forward as Rand entered  the parlor, her hand extended. The two other women in the big parlor  remained motionless. They would be the sisters, Geraldine Varcek and  Nelda Dunmore. Rand didn't wonder that they resented Gladys so bitterly;  economic considerations aside, girls seldom enthuse over a stepmother so  near their own age who is so much more beautiful.    \"Good afternoon, Colonel Rand,\" Gladys said. \"This is Mrs. Varcek.\" She  indicated a very pale blonde who sat slumped in a deep chair beside a low  cocktail-table, a highball in her hand. \"And Mrs. Dunmore.\" She was the  brunette with the full bust and hips, in the short black skirt and the  tight white sweater, who was standing by the fireplace.    \"H'lo.\" The blonde--Geraldine--smiled shyly at him. She had big blue  eyes, and delicately tinted rose-petal lips that seemed to be trying not  to laugh at some private joke. She wasn't exactly blotto, but she had  evidently laid a good foundation for a first-class jag. After all, it was  only two thirty in the afternoon.    The other sister--Nelda--didn't say anything. She merely stood and stared  at Rand distrustfully. Rand doubted that she ordinarily gave men the  hostile eye. The full, dark-red lips; the lush figure; the way she draped  it against the side of the fireplace, to catch the ruddy light on her  more interesting curves and bulges--there was a bimbo just made to be  leered at, and she probably resented it like hell if she weren't.    Rand gave them a general good-afternoon, then turned to Gladys. \"I had a  talk with Goode, yesterday afternoon,\" he said. \"I have his authorization  to handle all the details. As soon as I get an itemized list, I'll  circularize dealers and other possible buyers and ask for offers.\"    \"Is that all?\" Nelda demanded angrily of Gladys. \"Why Fred's done all  that already!\"    \"Is that correct, Mrs. Fleming?\" Rand asked, for the record.    \"I told you, yesterday, what's been done,\" Gladys replied. \"Fred has  talked to one dealer, Arnold Rivers. There has been no inventory of any  sort made.\"    \"Mr. Rivers is offering us ten thousand dollars,\" Nelda retorted. \"I  don't see why you had to bring this Colonel What's-his-name into it, at  all. You think he can get us a better offer? If you do, you're crazy!\"    \"Ten thousand dollars, for a collection that ought to sell for five times  that, in Macy's basement!\" Geraldine hooted. \"How much is Rivers slipping  Fred, on the side?\"    \"Oh, go back to your bottle!\" Nelda cried. \"You're too drunk to know what  you're talking about!\"    \"They tell me Colonel Rand is a detective, too,\" Geraldine continued.  \"Maybe he can find out why Fred never talked to Stephen Gresham, or Carl  Gwinnett, or anybody else except this Rivers. How much _is_ Fred getting  out of Rivers, anyhow?\"    \"My God, Geraldine, shut up!\" Nelda howled. Then she decided to take  direct notice of Rand's presence. \"Colonel Rand, I'm sorry to say that,  in her present condition, my sister doesn't know what she's saying. It's  bad enough for my stepmother to bring an outsider into what's obviously  a family matter, but when my sister begins making these ridiculous  accusations ...\"    \"What's ridiculous about them?\" Geraldine demanded, dumping another two  ounces of whiskey into her glass and freshening it with the siphon. \"I  think Rivers's offering ten thousand dollars for the collection, and  Fred's thinking we'd accept it, are the only ridiculous things about it.\"    \"That's rather what I told Rivers, this afternoon,\" Rand put in. \"He  seemed a bit upset about my being brought into this, too, but he finally  admitted that he was willing to pay up to twenty-five thousand dollars  for the collection, and if he buys it, that's exactly what it's going to  cost him.\"    \"_What?_\" Nelda fairly screamed. Her hands opened and closed  spasmodically: she was using a dark-red nail-tint that made Rand think  of blood-dripping talons.    \"Mr. Arnold Rivers told me, this afternoon, and I quote: I'm willing to  pay up to twenty-five thousand dollars for that collection, unquote,\"  Rand said. \"And I can tell you now that twenty-five thousand dollars is  just what he will pay for it, unless I can find somebody who's willing to  pay more, which is not at all improbable.\"    \"H'ray!\" Geraldine waved her glass and toasted Rand with it. \"And  twenty-five G ain't hay, brother!\"    Gladys smiled quickly at Rand, then turned to Nelda. \"Now I hope you see  why I thought it wise to bring in somebody who knows something about old  arms,\" she said.    Nelda evidently saw; there was apparently nothing stupid about her. \"And  Fred was going to take a miserable ten thousand dollars!\" The way she  said it, ten thousand sounded like a fairly generous headwaiter's tip.  \"Did Rivers actually tell you he'd pay twenty-five?\"    Rand gave, as nearly verbatim as possible, his conversation with the  dealer. \"And he can afford it, too,\" he finished. \"He can make a nice  profit on the collection, at that figure.\"    \"My God, do you mean the pistols are worth more than that, even?\" she  wanted to know, aghast.    \"Certainly, if you're a dealer with an established business, and  customers all over the country, and want to take five or six years to  make your profit,\" Rand replied. \"If you aren't, and want your money in  a hurry, no.\"    \"That's why I was against turning the collection over to Gwinnett on a  commission basis,\" Gladys said. \"It would take him five years to get  everything sold.\"    Nelda left the fireplace and advanced toward Rand. \"Colonel, I owe you an  apology,\" she said. \"I had no idea Father's pistols were worth anywhere  near that much. I don't suppose Fred did, either.\" She frowned. Wait till  she gets Fred alone, Rand thought; I'd hate to be in his spot.... \"You  say you're acting on Humphrey Goode's authority?\"    \"That's right. I'll negotiate the sale, but the money will be paid  directly to him, for distribution according to the terms of your father's  will.\" Rand got out Goode's letter and handed it to Nelda.    She read it carefully. \"I see.\" She seemed greatly relieved; she was  looking at Rand, now, as she was accustomed to look at men, particularly  handsome six-footers who were broad across the shoulders and narrow at  the hips and resembled King Charles II. She was probably wondering if  Rand was equal to Old Rowley in another important respect. \"I didn't  understand ... I thought....\" A dirty look, aimed at Gladys, explained  what she had thought. Then her glance fell on the bottle and siphon on  the table beside Geraldine's chair, and she changed the subject by  inquiring if Colonel Rand mightn't like a drink.    \"Well, let's go up to the gunroom,\" Gladys suggested. \"We can have our  drink"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#9)"],[1,"of theirs is one only and everlasting. But in men,  according to their present state of life, the final perfection is in  respect of an operation whereby man is united to God: but this  operation neither can be continual, nor, consequently, is it one  only, because operation is multiplied by being discontinued. And for  this reason in the present state of life, perfect happiness cannot be  attained by man. Wherefore the Philosopher, in placing man's  happiness in this life (Ethic. i, 10), says that it is imperfect, and  after a long discussion, concludes: \"We call men happy, but only as  men.\" But God has promised us perfect happiness, when we shall be \"as  the angels . . . in heaven\" (Matt. 22:30).    Consequently in regard to this perfect happiness, the objection fails:  because in that state of happiness, man's mind will be united to God  by one, continual, everlasting operation. But in the present life, in  as far as we fall short of the unity and continuity of that operation  so do we fall short of perfect happiness. Nevertheless it is a  participation of happiness: and so much the greater, as the operation  can be more continuous and more one. Consequently the active life,  which is busy with many things, has less of happiness than the  contemplative life, which is busied with one thing, i.e. the  contemplation of truth. And if at any time man is not actually engaged  in this operation, yet since he can always easily turn to it, and  since he ordains the very cessation, by sleeping or occupying himself  otherwise, to the aforesaid occupation, the latter seems, as it were,  continuous. From these remarks the replies to Objections 5 and 6 are  evident.  ________________________    THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 3]    Whether Happiness Is an Operation of the Sensitive Part, or of the  Intellective Part Only?    Objection 1: It would seem that happiness consists in an operation of  the senses also. For there is no more excellent operation in man than  that of the senses, except the intellective operation. But in us the  intellective operation depends on the sensitive: since \"we cannot  understand without a phantasm\" (De Anima iii, 7). Therefore happiness  consists in an operation of the senses also.    Obj. 2: Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iii) that happiness is \"a  state made perfect by the aggregate of all good things.\" But some  goods are sensible, which we attain by the operation of the senses.  Therefore it seems that the operation of the senses is needed for  happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness is the perfect good, as we find proved in  _Ethic._ i, 7: which would not be true, were not man perfected thereby  in all his parts. But some parts of the soul are perfected by  sensitive operations. Therefore sensitive operation is required for  happiness.    _On the contrary,_ Irrational animals have the sensitive operation in  common with us: but they have not happiness in common with us.  Therefore happiness does not consist in a sensitive operation.    _I answer that,_ A thing may belong to happiness in three ways: (1)  essentially, (2) antecedently, (3) consequently. Now the operation of  sense cannot belong to happiness essentially. For man's happiness  consists essentially in his being united to the Uncreated Good, Which  is his last end, as shown above (A. 1): to Which man cannot be united  by an operation of his senses. Again, in like manner, because, as  shown above (Q. 2, A. 5), man's happiness does not consist in goods  of the body, which goods alone, however, we attain through the  operation of the senses.    Nevertheless the operations of the senses can belong to happiness,  both antecedently and consequently: antecedently, in respect of  imperfect happiness, such as can be had in this life, since the  operation of the intellect demands a previous operation of the sense;  consequently, in that perfect happiness which we await in heaven;  because at the resurrection, \"from the very happiness of the soul,\"  as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dioscor.) \"the body and the bodily senses  will receive a certain overflow, so as to be perfected in their  operations\"; a point which will be explained further on when we treat  of the resurrection (Suppl. QQ. 82-85). But then the operation  whereby man's mind is united to God will not depend on the senses.    Reply Obj. 1: This objection proves that the operation of the senses  is required antecedently for imperfect happiness, such as can be had  in this life.    Reply Obj. 2: Perfect happiness, such as the angels have, includes  the aggregate of all good things, by being united to the universal  source of all good; not that it requires each individual good. But in  this imperfect happiness, we need the aggregate of those goods that  suffice for the most perfect operation of this life.    Reply Obj. 3: In perfect happiness the entire man is perfected, in  the lower part of his nature, by an overflow from the higher. But in  the imperfect happiness of this life, it is otherwise; we advance  from the perfection of the lower part to the perfection of the higher  part.  ________________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 4]    Whether, If Happiness Is in the Intellective Part, It Is an Operation  of the Intellect or of the Will?    Objection 1: It would seem that happiness consists in an act of  the will. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 10, 11), that man's  happiness consists in peace; wherefore it is written (Ps. 147:3):  \"Who hath placed peace in thy end [Douay: 'borders']\". But peace  pertains to the will. Therefore man's happiness is in the will.    Obj. 2: Further, happiness is the supreme good. But good is the  object of the will. Therefore happiness consists in an operation of  the will.    Obj. 3: Further, the last end corresponds to the first mover: thus  the last end of the whole army is victory, which is the end of the  general, who moves all the men. But the first mover in regard to  operations is the will: because it moves the other powers, as we  shall state further on (Q. 9, AA. 1, 3). Therefore happiness regards  the will.    Obj. 4: Further, if happiness be an operation, it must needs be man's  most excellent operation. But the love of God, which is an act of the  will, is a more excellent operation than knowledge, which is an  operation of the intellect, as the Apostle declares (1 Cor. 13).  Therefore it seems that happiness consists in an act of the will.    Obj. 5: Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 5) that \"happy is he  who has whatever he desires, and desires nothing amiss.\" And a little  further on (6) he adds: \"He is most happy who desires well, whatever  he desires: for good things make a man happy, and such a man already  possesses some good--i.e. a good will.\" Therefore happiness consists  in an act of the will.    _On the contrary,_ Our Lord said (John 17:3): \"This is eternal life:  that they may know Thee, the only true God.\" Now eternal life is the  last end, as stated above (A. 2, ad 1). Therefore man's happiness  consists in the knowledge of God, which is an act of the intellect.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 2, A. 6) two things are needed  for happiness: one, which is the essence of happiness: the other,  that is, as it were, its proper accident, i.e. the delight connected  with it. I say, then, that as to the very essence of happiness, it is  impossible for it to consist in an act of the will. For it is evident  from what has been said (AA. 1, 2; Q. 2, A. 7) that happiness is the  attainment of the last end. But the attainment of the end does not  consist in the very act of the will. For the will is directed to the  end, both absent, when it desires it; and present, when it is  delighted by resting therein. Now it is evident that the desire  itself of the end is not the attainment of the end, but is a movement  towards the end: while delight comes to the will from the end being  present; and not conversely, is a thing made present, by the fact  that the will delights in it. Therefore, that the end be present to  him who desires it, must be due to something else than an act of the  will.    This is evidently the case in regard to sensible ends. For if the  acquisition of money were through an act of the will, the covetous  man would have it from the very moment that he wished for it. But at  the moment it is far from him; and he attains it, by grasping it in  his hand, or in some like manner; and then he delights in the money  got. And so it is with an intelligible end. For at first we desire to  attain an intelligible end; we attain it, through its being made  present to us by an act of the intellect; and then the delighted will  rests in the end when attained.    So, therefore, the essence of happiness consists in an act of the  intellect: but the delight that results from happiness pertains to  the will. In this sense Augustine says (Confess. x, 23) that  happiness is \"joy in truth,\" because, to wit, joy itself is the  consummation of happiness.    Reply Obj. 1: Peace pertains to man's last end, not as though it were  the very essence of happiness; but because it is antecedent and  consequent thereto: antecedent, in so far as all those things are  removed which disturb and hinder man in attaining the last end:  consequent inasmuch as when man has attained his last end, he remains  at peace, his desire being at rest.    Reply Obj. 2: The will's first object is not its act: just as neither  is the first object of the sight, vision, but a visible thing.  Wherefore, from the very fact that happiness belongs to the will, as  the will's first object, it follows that it does not belong to it as  its act.    Reply Obj. 3: The intellect apprehends the end before the will does:  yet motion towards the end begins in the will. And therefore to the  will belongs that which last of all follows the attainment of the  end, viz. delight or enjoyment.    Reply Obj. 4: Love ranks above knowledge in moving, but "]]]
