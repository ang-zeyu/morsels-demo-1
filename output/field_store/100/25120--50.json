They were caused by _claws_, Petrie!\"    \"Claws! I thought so! But _what_ claws?\"    \"The claws of a poisonous thing. I recaptured the one used last night,  killed it--against my will--and buried it on the mound. I was afraid  to throw it in the pond, lest some juvenile fisherman should pull it  out and sustain a scratch. I don't know how long the claws would  remain venomous.\"    \"You are treating me like a child, Smith,\" I said, slowly. \"No doubt I  am hopelessly obtuse, but perhaps you will tell me what this Chinaman  carried in a leather bag and released upon Forsyth. It was something  which you recaptured, apparently with the aid of a plate of cold  turbot and a jug of milk. It was something, also, which Karamaneh had  been sent to recapture with the aid--\"    I stopped.    \"Go on,\" said Nayland Smith, turning the ray to the left; \"what did  she have in the basket?\"    \"Valerian,\" I replied mechanically.    The ray rested upon the lithe creature that I had shot down.    It was a black cat!    \"A cat will go through fire and water for valerian,\" said Smith; \"but  I got first innings this morning with fish and milk! I had recognized  the imprints under the trees for those of a cat, and I knew that if a  cat had been released here it would still be hiding in the  neighbourhood, probably in the bushes. I finally located a cat, sure  enough, and came for bait! I laid my trap, for the animal was too  frightened to be approachable, and then shot it; I had to. That yellow  fiend used the light as a decoy. The branch which killed him jutted  out over the path at a spot where an opening in the foliage above  allowed some moon rays to penetrate. Directly the victim stood  beneath, the Chinaman uttered his bird-cry; the one below looked up,  and the cat, previously held silent and helpless in the leather sack,  was dropped accurately upon his head!\"    \"But--\" I was growing confused.    Smith stooped lower.    \"The cat's claws are sheathed now,\" he said; \"but if you could examine  them you would find that they are coated with a shining black  substance. Only Fu-Manchu knows what that substance is, Petrie; but  you and I know what it can do!\"          CHAPTER VII    ENTER MR. ABEL SLATTIN      \"I don't blame you!\" rapped Nayland Smith. \"Suppose we say, then, a  thousand pounds if you show us the present hiding-place of Fu-Manchu,  the payment to be in no way subject to whether we profit by your  information or not?\"    Abel Slattin shrugged his shoulders, racially, and returned to the  armchair which he had just quitted. He reseated himself, placing his  hat and cane upon my writing-table.    \"A little agreement in black and white?\" he suggested smoothly.    Smith raised himself up out of the white cane chair, and, bending  forward over a corner of the table, scribbled busily upon a sheet of  notepaper with my fountain-pen.    The while he did so, I covertly studied our visitor. He lay back in  the armchair, his heavy eyelids lowered deceptively. He was a thought  overdressed--a big man, dark-haired and well-groomed, who toyed with a  monocle most unsuitable to his type. During the preceding  conversation, I had been vaguely surprised to note Mr. Abel Slattin's  marked American accent.    Sometimes, when Slattin moved, a big diamond which he wore upon the  third finger of his right hand glittered magnificently. There was a  sort of bluish tint underlying the dusky skin, noticeable even in his  hands but proclaiming itself significantly in his puffy face and  especially under the eyes. I diagnosed a labouring valve somewhere in  the heart system.    Nayland Smith's pen scratched on. My glance strayed from our Semitic  caller to his cane, lying upon the red leather before me. It was of  most unusual workmanship, apparently Indian, being made of some kind  of dark brown, mottled wood, bearing a marked resemblance to a snake's  skin; and the top of the cane was carved in conformity, to represent  the head of what I took to be a puff-adder, fragments of stone, or  beads, being inserted to represent the eyes, and the whole thing being  finished with an artistic realism almost startling.    When Smith had tossed the written page to Slattin, and he, having read  it with an appearance of carelessness, had folded it neatly and placed  it in his pocket, I said:    \"You have a curio here?\"    Our visitor, whose dark eyes revealed all the satisfaction which, by  his manner, he sought to conceal, nodded and took up the cane in his  hand.    \"It comes from Australia, doctor,\" he replied; \"it's aboriginal work,  and was given to me by a client. You thought it was Indian? Everybody  does. It's my mascot.\"    \"Really?\"    \"It is indeed. Its former owner ascribed magical powers to it! In  fact, I believe he thought that it was one of those staffs mentioned  in biblical history--\"    \"Aaron's rod?\" suggested Smith, glancing at the cane.    \"Something of the sort,\" said Slattin, standing up and again preparing  to depart.    \"You will 'phone us, then?\" asked my friend.    \"You will hear from me to-morrow,\" was the reply.    Smith returned to the cane armchair, and Slattin, bowing to both of  us, made his way to the door as I rang for the girl to show him out.    \"Considering the importance of his proposal,\" I began, as the door  closed, \"you hardly received our visitor with cordiality.\"    \"I hate to have any relations with him,\" answered my friend; \"but we  must not be squeamish respecting our instruments in dealing with Dr.  Fu-Manchu. Slattin has a rotten reputation--even for a private inquiry  agent. He is little better than a blackmailer--\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"Because I called on our friend Weymouth at the Yard yesterday and  looked up the man's record.\"    \"Whatever for?\"    \"I knew that he was concerning himself, for some reason, in the case.  Beyond doubt he has established some sort of communication with the  Chinese group; I am only wondering--\"    \"You don't mean--\"    \"Yes--I do, Petrie! I tell you he is unscrupulous enough to stoop even  to that.\"    No doubt Slattin knew that this gaunt, eager-eyed Burmese commissioner  was vested with ultimate authority in his quest of the mighty Chinaman  who represented things unutterable, whose potentialities for evil were  boundless as his genius, who personified a secret danger, the extent  and nature of which none of us truly understood. And, learning of  these things, with unerring Semitic instinct he had sought an opening  in this glittering Rialto. But there were _two_ bidders!    \"You think he may have sunk so low as to become a creature of  Fu-Manchu?\" I asked, aghast.    \"Exactly! If it paid him well I do not doubt that he would serve that  master as readily as any other. His record is about as black as it  well could be. Slattin is, of course, an assumed name; he was known as  Lieutenant Pepley when he belonged to the New York Police, and he was  kicked out of the service for complicity in an unsavoury Chinatown  case.\"    \"Chinatown!\"    \"Yes, Petrie, it made me wonder, too; and we must not forget that he  is undeniably a clever scoundrel.\"    \"Shall you keep any appointment which he may suggest?\"    \"Undoubtedly. But I shall not wait until to-morrow.\"    \"What!\"    \"I propose to pay a little informal visit to Mr. Abel Slattin  to-night.\"    \"At his office?\"    \"No; at his private residence. If, as I more than suspect, his object  is to draw us into some trap, he will probably report his favourable  progress to his employer to-night!\"    \"Then we should have followed him!\"    Nayland Smith stood up and divested himself of the old  shooting-jacket.    \"He _has_ been followed, Petrie,\" he replied, with one of his rare  smiles. \"Two C.I.D. men have been watching the house all night!\"    This was entirely characteristic of my friend's farseeing methods.    \"By the way,\" I said, \"you saw Eltham this morning. He will soon be  convalescent. Where, in Heaven's name, can he--\"    \"Don't be alarmed on his behalf, Petrie,\" interrupted Smith. \"His life  is no longer in danger.\"    I stared, stupidly.    \"No longer in danger!\"    \"He received, some time yesterday, a letter, written in Chinese, upon  Chinese paper, and enclosed in an ordinary business envelope, having a  typewritten address and bearing a London postmark.\"    \"Well?\"    \"As nearly as I can render the message in English it reads: 'Although,  because you are a brave man, you would not betray your correspondent in  China, he has been discovered. He was a mandarin, and as I cannot write  the name of a traitor, I may not name him. He was executed four days  ago. I salute you and pray for your speedy recovery.--FU-MANCHU.'\"    \"Fu-Manchu! But it is almost certainly a trap.\"    \"On the contrary, Petrie, Fu-Manchu would not have written in Chinese  unless he were sincere; and, to clear all doubt, I received a cable  this morning reporting that the Mandarin Yen-Sun-Yat was assassinated  in his own garden, in Nan-Yang, one day last week.\"          CHAPTER VIII    DR. FU-MANCHU STRIKES      Together we marched down the slope of the quiet, suburban avenue; to  take pause before a small, detached house displaying the hatchet  boards of the estate agent. Here we found unkempt laurel bushes, and  acacias run riot, from which arboreal tangle protruded the notice: \"To  be Let or Sold.\"    Smith, with an alert glance to right and left, pushed open the wooden  gate and drew me in upon the gravel path.

Just as you do not become embroiled  while on that run in any action which might influence the course of  history.\"    Ross went on polishing the blade he held. \"What would happen if someone  did break that rule?\"    Ashe put down the dagger he had been playing with. \"We don't know--we  just don't know. So far we have operated in the fringe territory,  keeping away from any district with a history which we can trace  accurately. Maybe some day--\" his eyes were on a wall of weapon racks he  plainly did not see--\"maybe some day we can stand and watch the rise of  the pyramids, witness the march of Alexander's armies.... But not yet.  We stay away from history, and we are sure that the Reds are doing the  same. It has become the old problem once presented by the atom bomb.  Nobody wants to upset the balance and take the consequences. Let us find  their outpost and we'll withdraw our men from all the other runs at  once.\"    \"What makes everyone so sure that they have an outpost somewhere?  Couldn't they be working right at the main source, sir?\"    \"They could, but for some reason they are not. As for how we know that  much, it's information received.\" Ashe smiled thinly. \"No, the source is  much farther back in time than their halfway post. But if we find that,  then we can trail them. So we plant men in suitable eras and hope for  the best. That's a good weapon you have there, Murdock. Are you willing  to wear it in earnest?\"    The inflection in that question caught Ross's full attention. His gray  eyes met those blue ones. This was it--at long last.    \"Right away?\"    Ashe picked up a belt of bronze plates strung together with chains, a  twin to that Ross had seen worn by the wolf slayer. He held it out to  the younger man. \"You can take your trial run any time--tomorrow.\"    Ross drew a deeper breath. \"Where--to when?\"    \"An island which will later be Britain. When? About two thousand B.C.  Beaker traders were beginning to open their stations there. This is your  graduation exercise, Murdock.\"    Ross fitted the blade he had been polishing into the wooden sheath on  the belt. \"If you say I can do it, I'm willing to try.\"    He caught that glance Ashe shot at him, but he could not read its  meaning. Annoyance? Impatience? He was still puzzling over it when the  other turned abruptly and left him alone.          CHAPTER 5      He might have said yes, but that didn't mean, Ross discovered, that he  was to be shipped off at once to early Britain. Ashe's \"tomorrow\" proved  to be several days later. The cover was that of a Beaker trader, and  Ross's impersonation was checked again and again by experts, making sure  that the last detail was correct and that no suspicion of a tribesman,  no mistake on Ross's part would betray him.    The Beaker people were an excellent choice for infiltration. They were  not a closely knit clan, suspicious of strangers and alert to any  deviation from the norm, as more race-conscious tribes might be. For  they lived by trade, leaving to Ross's own time the mark of their  far-flung \"empire\" in the beakers found in graves scattered in clusters  of a handful or so from the Rhineland to Spain, and from the Balkans to  Britain.    They did not depend only upon the taboo of the trade road for their  safety, for the Beakermen were master bowmen. A roving people, they  pushed into new territory to establish posts, living amicably among  peoples with far different customs--the Downs farmers, horse herders,  shore-side fisherfolk.    With Ashe, Ross passed a last inspection. Their hair had not grown long  enough to require braiding, but they did have enough to hold it back  from their faces with hide headbands. The kilt-tunics of coarse  material, duplicating samples brought from the past, were harsh to the  skin and poorly fitting. But the workmanship of their link-and-plate  bronze belts, the sleek bow guards strapped to their wrists, and the  bows themselves approached fine art. Ashe's round cloak was the blue of  a master trader, and he wore wealth in a necklace of polished wolf's  teeth alternating with amber beads. Ross's more modest position in the  tribe was indicated not only by his red-brown cloak, but by the fact  that his personal jewelry consisted only of a copper bracelet and a  cloak pin with a jet head.    He had no idea how the time transition was to be made, nor how one might  step from the polar regions of the Western Hemisphere to the island of  Britain lying off the Eastern. And it was a complicated business as he  discovered.    The transition itself was a fairly simple, though disturbing, process.  One walked a short corridor and stood for an instant on a plate while  the light centered there curled about in a solid core, shutting one off  from floor and wall. Ross gasped for breath as the air was sucked out of  his lungs. He experienced a moment of deathly sickness with the  sensation of being lost in nothingness. Then he breathed again and  looked through the dying wall of light to where Ashe waited.    Quick and easy as the trip through time had been, the journey to Britain  was something else. There could be only one transfer point if the secret  was to be preserved. But men from that point must be moved swiftly and  secretly to their appointed stations. Ross, knowing the strict rules  concerning the transportation of objects from one time to another,  wondered how that travel could be effected. After all, they could not  spend months, or even years, getting across continents and seas.    The answer was ingenious. Three days after they had stepped through the  barrier of time at the outpost, Ross and Ashe balanced on the rounded  back of a whale. It was a whale which would deceive anyone who did not  test its hide with a harpoon, and whalers with harpoons large enough to  trouble such a monster were yet well in the future.    Ashe slid a dugout into the water, and Ross climbed into that unsteady  craft, holding it against the side of the disguised sub until his  partner joined him. The day, misty and drizzling, made the shore they  aimed for a half-seen line across the water. With a shiver born of more  than cold, Ross dipped his paddle and helped Ashe send their crude boat  toward that half-hidden strip of land.    There was no real dawn; the sky lightened somewhat, but the drizzle  continued. Green patches showed among the winter-denuded trees back from  the beach, but the countryside facing them gave an impression of untamed  wilderness. Ross knew from his briefing that the whole of Britain was as  yet only sparsely settled. The first wave of hunter-fishers to establish  villages had been joined by other invaders who built massive tombs and  had an elaborate religion. Small village-forts had been linked from hill  to hill by trackways. There were \"factories,\" which turned out in bulk  such fine flint weapons and tools that a thriving industry was in full  operation, not yet having been superseded by the metal imported by the  Beaker merchants. Bronze was still so rare and costly that only the head  man of a village could hope to own one of the long daggers. Even the  arrowheads in Ross's quiver were chipped of flint.    They drew the dugout well up onto the shore and ran it into a shallow  depression in the bank, heaping stones and brush about for its  concealment. Then Ashe intently surveyed the surrounding country,  seeking a landmark.    \"Inland from here....\" Ashe used the language of the Beakermen, and Ross  knew that from now on he must not only live as a trader, but also think  as one. All other memories must be buried under the false one he had  learned; he must be interested in the present rate of exchange and the  chance for profit. The two men were on their way to Outpost Gog, where  Ashe's first partner, the redoubtable Sanford, was playing his role so  well.    The rain squished in their hide boots, made sodden strings of their  cloaks, plastered their woven caps to their thick mats of hair. Yet Ashe  bore steadily on across the land with the certainty of one following a  marked trail. His self-confidence was rewarded within the first half  mile when they came out upon one of the link trackways, its beaten  surface testifying to constant use.    Here Ashe turned eastward, stepping up the pace to a ground-covering  trot. The peace of the road held--at least by day. By night only the  most hardened and desperate outlaws would brave the harmful spirits  roving in the dark.    All the lore that had been pounded into him at the base began to make  some sense to Ross as he followed his guide, sniffing strange wet smells  from the brush, the trees, and the damp earth; piecing together in his  mind what he had been taught and what he now saw for himself, until it  made a tight pattern.    The track they were following sloped slightly upward, and a change in  the wind brought to them a sour odor, blanking out all normal scents.  Ashe halted so suddenly that Ross almost plowed into him. But he was  alerted by the older man's attitude.    Something had been burned! Ross drew in a deep lungful of the smell and  then wished that he had not. It was wood--burned wood--and something  else. Since this was not possibly normal, he was prepared for the way  Ashe melted into cover in the brush.    They worked their way, sometimes crawling on their bellies, through the  wet stands of dead grass, taking full advantage of all cover. They  crouched at the top of the hill while Ashe parted the prickly branches  of an evergreen bush to make them a window.    The black patch left by the fire, which had come from a ruin above, had  spread downhill on the opposite side of the valley. Charred posts still  stood like lone teeth in a skull to mark what must have once been one of  the stockade walls of a post. But all they now guarded was a desolation  from which came that overpowering"]]]
