Such differences, however, being accidental in character,  involve questions strictly of detail--of application--and do not  affect the principles which are common to warfare everywhere. To the  casual reader, therefore, they are less important to master and  {p.072} to retain in mind, however necessary to be observed, in order  to apprehend the relative advantages and disadvantages of the parties  to the conflict, and so to appreciate the skill or the defects shown  by either in the various circumstances that arise.    In South Africa such specific differences are to be found, not only in  the features of the country, which are more than usually exceptional,  or in the contrast of characteristics between the two races engaged,  which from the military point of view is very marked, but notably in  the uncertainties and impediments attending the lines of communication  by which the British army must be sustained nearly a thousand miles  from the sea. These embarrassments are manifest in the great length  and small capacity of the single-track railroad--750 miles to  Bloemfontein and over 1,000 to Pretoria; in the difficulty and  slowness of transport by all other means; in the problems of water,  and of pasturage, as affected by the wet and dry seasons; in the  effect of all these upon mobility, and in the influence on questions  of transport, and of all mobile services, exercised by {p.073} the  regional sickness that rapidly destroys the greater part of  non-acclimated horses.    Communications dominate war; to protect long lines of communication  from serious interference by raids demands an ample mobile force.    These are general principles of warfare, universally applicable. The  questions of water, pasturage, and horse sickness are special to South  Africa, as is also in some degree the inadequate railway system; and  these constitute conditions which modify the local application of  general principles. Two factors, however, have appeared in this war  which, while they characterise it especially, are gravely significant  to those who would fain seek in current events instruction for the  future, whether of warning or of encouragement. These are the almost  complete failure of the British Government and people to recognise at  the beginning the bigness of the task before them; and, in the second  place, the enthusiasm and practical unanimity with which not South  Africa only but the other and distant British colonies offered their  services {p.074} to the mother country. The philosophical reflector  can scarcely fail to be impressed with this latter political fact; for  it has illustrated vividly the general truth that, when once men's  minds are prepared, a simple unforeseen incident converts what has  seemed an academic theory, or an idle dream, into a concrete and most  pregnant fact.    The naval battle of Manila Bay will to the future appear one of the  decisive events of history, for there the visions of the few, which  had quickened unconsciously the conceptions of the many, materialised  as suddenly as unexpectedly into an actuality that could be neither  obviated nor undone. What Dewey's victory was to the over-sea  expansion of the United States, what the bombardment of Fort Sumter in  1861 was to the sentiment of Union in the Northern States, that Paul  Kruger's ultimatum, summarizing in itself the antecedent  disintegrating course of the Afrikander Bond, was to Imperial  Federation. A fruitful idea, which the unbeliever had thought to bury  under scoffs, had taken root in the convictions of men, and passed as  by a bound into vigorous life--perfect, if not yet {p.075} mature. In  these months of war, a common devotion, a common service, a common  achievement, will have constituted a bond of common memories and  recognised community of ideals and interests. To a political entity  these are as a living spirit, which, when it exists, can well await  the slow growth of formal organisation, and of compact, that are but  the body, the material framework, of political life.    It is evident enough that the Transvaal War was the occasion, not the  cause, of the manifested unity of purpose which resulted in immediate  common action between communities so far apart, geographically, as the  British Islands, Canada and Australasia. As early as July 11 the  Governor of Queensland had telegraphed that in case of hostilities the  colony would offer two hundred and fifty mounted infantry, and on  September 29 the Governor of New Zealand sent a message of like tenor.  Before the Boer ultimatum was issued, Western Australia and Tasmania  had volunteered contingents. The other colonies rapidly followed these  examples. There were, indeed, here and there manifestations of  {p.076} dissent, but they turned mainly upon questions of  constitutional interpretation and propriety, and even as such received  comparatively little attention in the overwhelming majority of popular  sentiment.    The attitude of the Imperial Government throughout was strictly and  even scrupulously correct. The action of the colonies was left to be  purely voluntary, the aid accepted from them being freely proffered,  and the expenses of equipment and transportation by themselves voted.  Not till the landing of the colonial troops in Africa were they taken  into pay as an integral part of the Imperial forces, to which they  were assimilated also as regards support in the field, and in matters  of pension for wounds and other compassionate allowances.    The rapidity which characterised the movements on the part of the  various colonies affords the most convincing proof, not only of the  cordial readiness of their co-operation, but of the antecedent  attitude of thoughtful sentiment toward the home country and the  interests of the Empire, which is a far more important matter than the  relatively scanty numbers {p.077} of men sent. Imperial Federation is  a most momentous fact in the world's history, but in material results  it concerns the future rather than the present.    On the 9th of October the Boer ultimatum was issued. On the 23rd the  contingent from British Columbia left Vancouver, to cross the  continent to Quebec, where the Canadian force was to assemble; and  from that port, on the 30th of the same month, the \"Sardinian,\" of the  Canadian line, sailed with 1,049 officers and men. The New Zealanders  and part of those from New South Wales had already started, and by the  5th of November there was left in Australia but one small steamer's  load, of less than one hundred men with their horses, which was not  already at sea speeding for Cape Town. To what was known officially as  the First Colonial Contingent the Australasian colonies contributed  1,491 officers and men.    It is impossible to an American reading these facts not to recall that  there was a day when troops, from what were then North American  colonies, fought for Great Britain in the trenches at Havana, and  before Louisburg in {p.078} Cape Breton, as well as in the more  celebrated campaigns on the lines of Lake Champlain and the St.  Lawrence. But--and herein is the contrast between past and present  that makes the latter so vitally interesting--neither mother country  nor colonies had then aroused to consciousness of world-wide  conditions, for which indeed the time was not yet ripe, but by which  alone immediate and purely local considerations can be seen in their  true proportions, and allowed proper relative weight. From those old  wars the mother country expected but an addition to her colonial  system, to be utilised for her own advantage; the colonists, outside  the love of adventure inherent in their blood, were moved almost  wholly by the jealousies and dangers of the immediate situation, as  the South African colonists have in part been in the present instance.  American concern naturally, inevitably as things then were, did not  travel outside the range of American interests, American  opportunities, American dangers, while the British Government regarded  its colonies as all mother countries in those days did. Consequently,  when the wills of {p.079} the one and the other clashed, there was no  common unifying motive, no lofty sentiment--such as that of national  Union was in 1861 to those who experienced it--to assert supremacy, to  induce conciliation, by subordinating immediate interest and  conviction of rights to its own superior claim.    After making due allowance for mere racial sympathy, which in the  present contest has had even in the neutral United States so large a  share in determining individual sympathies, the claim of an English  newspaper is approximately correct, that the universal action of the  colonies, where volunteering far exceeded the numbers first sent,  \"indicates what is the opinion of bodies of free men, widely separated  by social and geographical conditions, concerning the justice and  necessity of the quarrel in which we are now engaged.\" But this takes  too little account of the much more important political fact that cold  opinion was quickened to hot action by the sentiment of the unity of  the Empire, an ideal which under different conditions may well take to  Imperial Federation the place that the Union occupied in American  hearts {p.080} and minds in 1861. Alike in breadth of view and in  force of sentiment, nothing exceeds the power of such an ideal to lift  men above narrow self-interest to the strenuous self-devotion demanded  by great emergencies. Should this be so in the present case, and  increase, Imperial Federation and the expansion of the United States  are facts, which, whether taken singly or in correlation, are  secondary in importance to nothing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#9)"],[1,", wringing his hands in  agony, he moaned: \"Oh, my Gregory, my Gregory, would I were where thou  art.\" When Gregory recovered, Rockycana pleaded for him, and the King  allowed the good old Patriarch to return in peace to Kunwald.    Meanwhile, the first persecution of the Brethren had begun in deadly  earnest {1461.}. King George Podiebrad was furious. He issued an order  that all his subjects were to join either the Utraquist or the Roman  Catholic Church. He issued another order that all priests who conducted  the Communion in the blasphemous manner of the Brethren should forthwith  be put to death. The priest, old Michael, was cast into a dungeon; four  leading Brethren were burned alive; the peaceful home in Kunwald was  broken; and the Brethren fled to the woods and mountains. For two full  years they lived the life of hunted deer in the forest. As they durst  not light a fire by day, they cooked their meals by night; and then,  while the enemy dreamed and slept, they read their Bibles by the  watch-fires' glare, and prayed till the blood was dripping from their  knees. If provisions ran short, they formed a procession, and marched in  single file to the nearest village; and when the snow lay on the ground  they trailed behind them a pine-tree branch, so that folk would think a  wild beast had been prowling around. We can see them gathering in those  Bohemian glades. As the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky, and  the night wind kissed the pine trees, they read to each other the golden  promise that where two or three were gathered together in His name He  would be in the midst of them;[12] and rejoiced that they, the chosen of  God, had been called to suffer for the truth and the Church that was yet  to be.    In vain they appealed to Rockycana; he had done with them for ever.  \"Thou art of the world,\" they wrote, \"and wilt perish with the world.\"  They were said to have made a covenant with the devil, and were commonly  dubbed \"Pitmen\" because they lived in pits and caves. Yet not for a  moment did they lose hope. At the very time when the king in his  folly thought they were crushed beneath his foot, they were in reality  increasing in numbers every day. As their watch-fires shone in the  darkness of the forests, so their pure lives shone among a darkened  people. No weapon did they use except the pen. They never retaliated,  never rebelled, never took up arms in their own defence, never even  appealed to the arm of justice. When smitten on one cheek, they turned  the other; and from ill-report they went to good report, till the King  for very shame had to let them be. Well aware was he that brutal force  could never stamp out spiritual life. \"I advise you,\" said a  certain Bishop, \"to shed no more blood. Martyrdom is somewhat like a  half-roasted joint of meat, apt to breed maggots.\"    And now the time drew near for Gregory's dream to come true. When the  Brethren settled in the valley of Kunwald they had only done half their  work. They had quitted the \"benighted\" Church of Rome; they had not  yet put a better Church in her place. They had settled on a Utraquist  estate; they were under the protection of a Utraquist King;  they attended services conducted by Utraquist priests. But this  black-and-white policy could not last for ever. If they wished to be  godly men themselves, they must have godly men in the pulpits. What  right had they, the chosen of God (as they called themselves) to listen  to sermons from men in league with the State? What right had they  to take the Holy Bread and Wine from the tainted hands of Utraquist  priests? What right had they to confess their sins to men with the brand  of Rome upon their foreheads? If they were to have any priests at all,  those priests, like Caesar's wife, must be above suspicion. They must be  pastors after God's own heart, who should feed the people with knowledge  and understanding (Jer. iii. 15). They must be clear of any connection  with the State. They must be descended from the twelve Apostles. They  must be innocent of the crime of simony. They must work with their hands  for their living, and be willing to spend their money on the poor. But  where could such clean vessels of the Lord be found? For a while  the Brethren were almost in despair; for a while they were even half  inclined to do without priests at all. In vain they searched the country  round; in vain they inquired about priests in foreign lands. When they  asked about the pure Nestorian Church supposed to exist in India, they  received the answer that that Church was now as corrupt as the Romish.  When they asked about the Greek Church in Russia, they received the  answer that the Russian Bishops were willing to consecrate any man, good  or bad, so long as he paid the fees. The question was pressing. If they  did without good priests much longer, they would lose their standing in  the country. \"You must,\" said Brother Martin Lupac, a Utraquist priest,  who had joined their ranks, \"you must establish a proper order of  priests from among yourselves. If you don't, the whole cause will be  ruined. To do without priests is no sin against God; but it is a sin  against your fellow-men.\" As they pondered on the fateful question, the  very light of Heaven itself seemed to flash upon their souls. It was  they who possessed the unity of the spirit; and therefore it was they  who were called to renew the Church of the Apostles. They had now become  a powerful body; they were founding settlements all over the land; they  stood, they said, for the truth as it was in Jesus; they had all one  faith, one hope, one aim, one sense of the Spirit leading them onward;  and they perceived that if they were to weather the gale in those stormy  times they must cut the chains that bound them to Rome, and fly their  own colours in the breeze.    And so, in 1467, about ten years after the foundation of Kunwald, there  met at Lhota a Synod of the Brethren to settle the momentous question  {1467.}, \"Is it God's will that we separate entirely from the power  of the Papacy, and hence from its priesthood? Is it God's will that we  institute, according to the model of the Primitive Church, a ministerial  order of our own?\" For weeks they had prayed and fasted day and night.  About sixty Brethren arrived. The Synod was held in a tanner's cottage,  under a cedar tree; and the guiding spirit Gregory the Patriarch, for  his dream was haunting him still. The cottage has long since gone; but  the tree is living yet.    The fateful day arrived. As the morning broke, those sixty men were  all on their knees in prayer. If that prayer had been omitted the whole  proceedings would have been invalid. As the Master, said they, had  prayed on the Mount before he chose His twelve disciples, so they must  spend the night in prayer before they chose the elders of the Church.  And strange, indeed, their manner of choosing was. First the Synod  nominated by ballot nine men of blameless life, from whom were to be  chosen, should God so will, the first Pastors of the New Church. Next  twelve slips of paper were folded and put into a vase. Of these slips  nine were blank, and three were marked \"Jest,\" the Bohemian for \"is.\"  Then a boy named Procop entered the room, drew out nine slips, and  handed them round to the nine nominated Brethren.    There was a hush, a deep hush, in that humble room. All waited for God  to speak. The fate of the infant Church seemed to hang in the balance.  For the moment the whole great issue at stake depended on the three  papers left in the vase. It had been agreed that the three Brethren who  received the three inscribed papers should be ordained to the ministry.  The situation was curious. As the Brethren rose from their knees that  morning they were all as sure as men could be that God desired them to  have Pastors of their own; and yet they deliberately ran the risk that  the lot might decide against them.[13] What slips were those now lying in  the vase? Perhaps the three inscribed ones. But it turned out otherwise.  All three were drawn, and Matthias of Kunwald, Thomas of Prelouic, and  Elias of Chrenouic, are known to history as the first three ministers of  the Brethren's Church. And then Gregory the Patriarch stepped forward,  and announced with trembling voice that these three men were the very  three that he had seen in his trance in the torture-chamber at Prague.  Not a man in the room was surprised; not a man doubted that here again  their prayers had been plainly answered. Together the members of the  Synod arose and saluted the chosen three. Together, next day, they sang  in a hymn written for the occasion:--       We needed faithful men, and He     Granted us such.  Most earnestly,     We Pray, Lord, let Thy gifts descend,     That blessing may Thy work attend.[14]  But the battle was not won even yet. If these three good men, now chosen  by Christ, were to be acknowledged as priests in Bohemia, they must  be ordained in the orthodox way by a Bishop of pure descent from the  Apostles. For this purpose they applied to Stephen, a Bishop of the  Waldenses. He was just the man they needed. He was a man of noble  character. He was a man whose word could be trusted. He had often given  them information about the Waldensian line of Bishops. He had told them  how that line ran back to the days of the early Church. He had told them  how the Waldensian Bishops had kept the ancient faith unsullied, and had  never broken the law of Christ by uniting with the wicked State. To  that line of Bishops he himself belonged. He had no connection with the  Church of Rome, and no connection with the State. What purer orders,  thought the Brethren, could they desire? They believed his statements;  they trusted his honour; they admired his personal character; and now  they sent old Michael Bradacius to see him in South Moravia and to lay  their case before him. The old Bishop shed tears of joy. \"He"]]]
