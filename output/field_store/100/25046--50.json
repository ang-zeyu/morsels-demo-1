Deacon Todd now came out cautiously.    \"I've got it on him, mother, tho' he's terrible unresigned to it; an'  I've given him a stiff dose o' Jamaica Ginger. We can tell pretty soon  whether he can take his part.\"    \"Here's Dick Larrabee come back, Isaac, just when we thought he had  given up Beulah for good an' all!\" said Mrs. Todd.    The Deacon stood on the top step, his gaunt, grizzled face peering  above the collar of his great coat; not a man to eat his words very  often, Deacon Isaac Todd.    \"Well, young man,\" he said, \"you've found your way home, have you?  It's about time, if you want to see your father alive!\"    \"If it hadn't been for you and others like you, men who had forgotten  what it was to be young, I should never have gone away,\" said Dick  hotly. \"What had I done worse than a dozen others, only that I  happened to be the minister's son?\"    \"That's just it; you were bringin' trouble on the parish, makin' talk  that reflected on your father. Folks said if he couldn't control his  own son, he wa'n't fit to manage a church. You played cards, you  danced, you drove a fast horse.\"    \"I never did a thing I'm ashamed of but one,\"--and Dick's voice was  firm. \"My misdeeds were nothing but boyish nonsense, but the village  never gave me credit for a single virtue. I ought to have remembered  father's position, but whatever I was or whatever I did, you had no  right to pray for me openly for full five minutes at a public meeting.  That galled me worse than anything!\"    \"Now, Isaac,\" interrupted Mrs. Todd. \"I hope you'll believe me! I've  told you once a week, on an average, these last three years, that you  might have chastened Dick some other way besides prayin' for him in  meetin'!\"    The Deacon smiled grimly. \"You both talk as if prayin' was one of the  seven deadly sins,\" he said.    \"I'm not objecting to your prayers,\" agreed Dick, \"but there were  plenty of closets in your house where you might have gone and told the  Lord your opinion of me; only that wasn't good enough for you; you  must needs tell the whole village!\"    \"There, father, that's what I always said,\" agreed Mrs. Todd.    \"Well, I ain't one that can't yield when the majority's against me,\"  said the Deacon, \"particularly when I'm treatin' John Trimble for the  colic. If you'll stop actin' so you threaten to split the church, Dick  Larrabee, I'll stop prayin' for you. The Lord knows how I feel about  it now, so I needn't keep on remindin' Him.\"          [Illustration]    IX      \"That's a bargain and here's my hand on it,\" cried Dick. \"Now, what do  you say to letting me be Santa Claus? Come on in and let's look at  John Trimble. He'd make a splendid Job or Jeremiah, but I wouldn't let  him spoil a Christmas festival!\"    \"Do let Dick take the part, father,\"--and Mrs. Todd's tone was most  ingratiating. \"John's terrible dull and bashful anyway, an' mebbe he'd  have a pain he couldn't stan' jest when he's givin' out the presents.  An' Dick is always so amusin'.\"    Deacon Todd led the way into the improvised dressing-room. He had  removed John's gala costume in order to apply the mustard faithfully  and he lay in a crumpled heap in the corner. The plaster itself  adorned a stool near by.    \"Now, John! John! That plaster won't do you no good on the stool. It  ain't the stool that needs drawin'; it's your stomach,\" argued Mrs.  Todd.    \"I'm drawed pretty nigh to death a'ready,\" moaned John. \"I'm rore,  that's what I am,--rore! An' I won't be Santa Claus neither. I want to  go home.\"    \"Wrop him up and get him into your sleigh, father, and take him home;  then come right back. Bed's the place for him. Keep that hot  flat-iron on his stomach, if he'd rather have it than the mustard.  Men-folks are such cowards. I'll dress Dick while you're gone. Mebbe  it's a Providence!\"    On the whole, Dick agreed with Mrs. Todd as he stood ready to make his  entrance. The School Committee was in the church and he had had much  to do with its members in former days. The Select-men of the village  were present, and he had made their acquaintance once, in an executive  session. The deacons were all there and the pillars of the church and  the choir and the organist--a spinster who had actively disapproved  when he had put beans in the melodeon one Sunday. Yes, it was best to  meet them in a body on a festive occasion like this, when the rigors  of the village point of view were relaxed. It would relieve him of  several dozen private visits of apology, and altogether he felt that  his courage would have wavered had he not been disguised as another  person altogether: a popular favorite; a fat jolly, rollicking  dispenser of bounties to the general public. When he finally discarded  his costume, would it not be easier, too, to meet his father first  before the church full of people and have the solemn hour with him  alone, later at night? Yes, as Mrs. Todd said, \"Mebbe 'twas a  Providence!\"           *       *       *       *       *    There was never such a merry Christmas festival in the Orthodox church  of Beulah; everybody was of one mind as to that. There was a momentary  fear that John Trimble, a pillar of prohibition, might have imbibed  hard cider; so gay, so nimble, so mirth-provoking was Santa Claus.  When was John Trimble ever known to unbend sufficiently to romp up the  side aisle jingling his sleigh bells, and leap over a front pew  stuffed with presents, to gain the vantage-ground he needed for the  distribution of his pack? The wing pews on one side of the pulpit had  been floored over and the Christmas Tree stood there, triumphant in  beauty, while the gifts strewed the green-covered platform at its  feet.    How gay, how audacious, how witty was Santa Claus! How the village had  always misjudged John Trimble, and how completely had John Trimble  hitherto obscured his light under a bushel. In his own proper person  children avoided him, but they crowded about this Santa Claus,  encircling his legs, gurgling with joy when they were lifted to his  shoulder, their laughter ringing through the church at his droll  antics. A sense of mystery grew when he opened a pack on the pulpit  stairs, a pack unfamiliar in its outward aspect to the Committee on  Entertainment. Every girl had a little doll dressed in fashionable  attire, and every boy a brilliantly colored, splendidly noisy, tin  trumpet; but hanging to every toy by a red ribbon was Mrs. Larrabee's  Christmas card; her despised one about the \"folks back home.\"    [Illustration: HANDS THAT TREMBLED, AS EVERYBODY COULD SEE]    The publishers' check to the minister's wife had been accompanied by a  dozen complimentary copies, but these had been sent to Reba's Western  friends and relations; and although the card was on many a  marble-topped table in Beulah, it had not been bought by all the  inhabitants, by any means. Fifteen cents would purchase something  useful, and Beulah did not contain many Croesuses. Still, here the  cards were,--enough of them for everybody,--with a linen handkerchief  for every woman and every man in the meeting-house, and a dozen more  sticking out of the pack, as the people in the front pews could  plainly see. Modest gifts, but plenty of them, and nobody knew from  whence they came! There was a buzzing in the church, a buzzing that  grew louder and more persistent when Santa Claus threw a lace scarf  around Mrs. Larrabee's shoulders and approached her husband with a  fine beaver collar in his hands: hands that trembled, as everybody  could see, when he buttoned the piece of fur around the old minister's  neck.    And the minister? He had been half in, and half out of, a puzzling  dream for ten minutes, and when those hands of Santa Claus touched  him, his flesh quivered. They reminded him of baby fingers that had  crept around his neck years ago when he patiently walked the parsonage  floor at night with his ailing child in his arms. Every drop of blood  in his veins called out for answer. He looked above the white cotton  beard and mustache to a pair of dark eyes; merry, mischievous, yet  tender and soft; at a brown wavy lock escaping from the home-made wig.  Then those who were near heard a weak voice say, \"My son!\" and those  who were far away observed Santa Claus tear off his wig and beard,  heard him cry, \"Father!\"--and, as Mrs. Todd said afterwards, saw him  \"fall on to the minister's neck right there before the whole caboodle,  an' cling to him for all the world like an engaged couple, only they  wouldn't 'a' made so free in public.\"    No ice but would have thawed in such an atmosphere! Grown-up Beulah  forgot how much trouble Dick Larrabee had caused in other days, and  the children had found a friend for all time. The extraordinary number  of dolls, trumpets, handkerchiefs, and Christmas cards circulating in  the meeting-house raised the temperature considerably, and induced a  general feeling that if Dick Larrabee had really ever been a bit wild  and reckless, he had evidently reformed, and prospered, besides.    Yes, no one but a kind and omniscient Providence could have so  beautifully arranged Dick Larrabee's homecoming, and so wisely  superintended his complete reinstatement in the good graces of Beulah  village. A few maiden ladies felt that he had been a trifle immodest  in embracing, and especially in kissing, his father in front of the  congregation; venturing the conviction that kissing, an indecorous  custom in any event, was especially lamentable in public.    \"Pity Letty Boynton missed this evenin',\" said Mrs. Todd. \"Her an'  Dick allers had a fancy for each other, so I've heard, though I don't  know how true. Clarissa Perry might jest as well have stayed with the  twins as not, for her niece that spoke a piece forgot 'bout half of it  an' Clarissa was in a cold sweat every minute. Then the niece had a  fit o' cryin', she was so ashamed at failin', an' Clarissa had to take  her home. So they both missed the tree, an' "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#9)"],[1,"age they lived in, and the cement which bound society in a  compact whole was fast melting under this powerful solvent.    Rousseau, with his romantic philosophy and eloquence, had planted his  new ideas deep in the hearts of his contemporaries, weary with the  artifice and the corruption of a time which had exhausted itself and had  nothing to promise under the old social _regime_. The ideals uplifted in  the \"Nouvelle Heloise\" and the \"Confessions\" awakened men's minds with  a great rebound to the charms of Nature, simplicity, and a social order  untrammeled by rules or conventions. The eloquence with which these  theories were propounded carried the French people by storm, and  Rousseau was a demigod at whose shrine worshiped alike duchess and  peasant. The Encyclopedists stimulated the ferment by their literary  enthusiasm, and the heartiness with which they cooperated with the whole  current of revolutionary thought.    The very atmosphere was reeking with the prophecy of imminent  change. Versailles itself did not escape the contagion. Courtiers  and aristocrats, in worshiping the beautiful ideals set up by the new  school, which were as far removed as possible from their own effete  civilization, did not realize that they were playing with the fire which  was to burn out the whole social edifice of France with such a terrible  conflagration; for, back and beneath all this, there was a people  groaning under long centuries of accumulated wrong, in whose imbruted  hearts the theories applauded by their oppressors with a sort of  _doctrinaire_ delight were working with a fatal fever.      III.    In this strange condition of affairs Gluck found his new sphere of  labor--Gluck, himself overflowing with the revolutionary spirit, full  of the enthusiasm of reform. At first he carried everything before him.  Protected by royalty, he produced, on the basis of an admirable libretto  by Du Rollet, one of the great wits of the time, \"Iphigenia in Aulis.\"  It was enthusiastically received. The critics, delighted to establish  the reputation of one especially favored by the Dau-phiness Marie  Antoinette, exhausted superlatives on the new opera. The Abbe Arnaud,  one of the leading _dilettanti_, exclaimed: \"With such music one might  found a new religion!\" To be sure, the connoisseurs could not  understand the complexities of the music; but, following the rule of all  connoisseurs before or since, they considered it all the more learned  and profound. So led, the general public clapped their hands, and agreed  to consider Gluck as a great composer. He was called the Hercules of  music; the opera-house was crammed night after night; his footsteps  were dogged in the streets by admiring enthusiasts; the wits and poets  occupied themselves with composing sonnets in his praise; brilliant  courtiers and fine ladies showered valuable gifts on the new musical  oracle; he was hailed as the exponent of Rousseauism in music. We read  that it was considered to be a priceless privilege to be admitted to  the rehearsal of a new opera, to see Gluck conduct in nightcap and  dressing-gown.    Fresh adaptations of \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" and of \"Alceste\" were  produced. The first, brought out in 1784, was received with an  enthusiasm which could be contented only with forty-nine consecutive  performances. The second act of this work has been called one of the  most astonishing productions of the human mind. The public began to show  signs of fickleness, however, on the production of the \"Alceste.\" On the  first night a murmur arose among the spectators: \"The piece has fallen.\"  Abbe Arnaud, Gluck's devoted defender, arose in his box and replied:  \"Yes! fallen from heaven.\" While Mademoiselle Levasseur was singing one  of the great airs, a voice was heard to say, \"Ah! you tear out my ears;\"  to which the caustic rejoinder was: \"How fortunate, if it is to give  you others!\"    Gluck himself was badly bitten, in spite of his hatred of shams and  shallowness, with the pretenses of the time, which professed to dote on  nature and simplicity. In a letter to his old pupil, Marie Antoinette,  wherein he disclaims any pretension of teaching the French a new school  of music, he says: \"I see with satisfaction that the language of Nature  is the universal language.\"    So, here on the crumbling crust of a volcano, where the volatile French  court danced and fiddled and sang, unreckoning of what was soon to  come, our composer and his admirers patted each other on the back with  infinite complacency.    But after this high tide of prosperity there was to come a reverse. A  powerful faction, that for a time had been crushed by Gluck's triumph,  after a while raised their heads and organized an attack. There were  second-rate composers whose scores had been laid on the shelf in the  rage for the new favorite; musicians who were shocked and enraged at the  difficulties of his instrumentation; wits who, having praised Gluck for  a while, thought they could now find a readier field for their quills  in satire; and a large section of the public who changed for no earthly  reason but that they got tired of doing one thing.    Therefore, the Italian Piccini was imported to be pitted against the  reigning deity. The French court was broken up into hostile ranks. Marie  Antoinette was Gluck's patron, but Madame Du Barry, the king's mistress,  declared for Piccini. Abbe Arnaud fought for Gluck; but the witty  Marmontel was the advocate of his rival. The keen-witted Du Rollet  was Gluckist; but La Harpe, the eloquent, was Piccinist. So this  battle-royal in art commenced and raged with virulence. The green-room  was made unmusical with contentions carried out in polite Billingsgate.  Gluck tore up his unfinished score in rage when he learned that his  rival was to compose an opera on the same libretto. La Harpe said: \"The  famous Gluck may puff his own compositions, but he can't prevent them  from boring us to death.\" Thus the wags of Paris laughed and wrangled  over the musical rivals. Berton, the new director, fancied he could  soften the dispute and make the two composers friends; so at a  dinner-party, when they were all in their cups, he proposed that they  should compose an opera jointly. This was demurred to; but it was  finally arranged that they should compose an opera on the same subject.    \"Iphigenia in Tauris,\" Gluck's second \"Iphigenia,\" produced in 1779, was  such a masterpiece that his rival shut his own score in his portfolio,  and kept it two years. All Paris was enraptured with this great work,  and Gluck's detractors were silenced in the wave of enthusiasm which  swept the public. Abbe Arnaud's opinion was the echo of the general  mind: \"There was but one beautiful part, and that was the whole of it.\"  This opera may be regarded as the most perfect example of Gluck's  school in making the music the full reflex of the dramatic action. While  Orestes sings in the opera, \"My heart is calm,\" the orchestra continues  to paint the agitation of his thoughts. During the rehearsal the  musician failed to understand the exigency and ceased playing. The  composer cried out, in a rage: \"Don't you see he is lying? Go on, go  on; he as just killed his mother.\" On one occasion, when he was praising  Rameau's chorus of \"Castor and Pollux,\" an admirer of his flattered him  with the remark, \"But what a difference between this chorus and that of  your 'Iphigenie'!\" \"Yet it is very well done,\" said Gluck; \"one is only  a religious ceremony, the other is a real funeral.\" He was wont to say  that in composing he always tried to forget he was a musician.    Gluck, however, a few months subsequent to this, was so much humiliated  at the non-success of \"Echo and Narcissus,\" that he left Paris in bitter  irritation, in spite of Marie Antoinette's pleadings that he should  remain at the French capital.    The composer was now advanced in years, and had become impatient and  fretful. He left Paris for Vienna in 1780, having amassed considerable  property. There, as an old, broken-down man, he listened to the young  Mozart's new symphonies and operas, and applauded them with great zeal;  for Gluck, though fiery and haughty in the extreme, was singularly  generous in recognizing the merits of others.    This was exhibited in Paris in his treatment of Mehul, the Belgian  composer, then a youth of sixteen, who had just arrived in the gay city.  It was on the eve of the first representation of \"Iphigenia in Tauris,\"  when the operatic battle was agitating the public. With all the ardor  of a novice and a devotee, the young musical student immediately threw  himself into the affray, and by the aid of a friend he succeeded in  gaining admittance to the theatre for the final rehearsal of Gluck's  opera. This so enchanted him that he resolved to be present at the  public performance. But, unluckily for the resolve, he had no money, and  no prospect of obtaining any; so, with a determination and a love for  art which deserve to be remembered, he decided to hide himself in one of  the boxes and there to wait for the time of representation.    \"At the end of the rehearsal,\" writes George Hogarth in his \"Memoirs  of the Drama,\" \"he was discovered in his place of concealment by the  servants of the theatre, who proceeded to turn him out very roughly.  Gluck, who had not left the house, heard the noise, came to the  spot, and found the young man, whose spirit was roused, resisting the  indignity with which he was treated. Mehul, finding in whose presence  he was, was ready to sink with confusion; but, in answer to Gluck's  questions, he told him that he was a young musical student from the  country, whose anxiety to be present at the performance of the opera  had led him into the commission of an impropriety. Gluck, as may be  supposed, was delighted with a piece of enthusiasm so flattering to  himself, and not only gave his young admirer a ticket of admission, but"]]]
