The Sheep could see them now and then when the  door was open. Once the farmer stood in the doorway and seemed to be  counting them. This made them huddle together more closely than ever.  They could see the men carrying clean yellow straw into the barn and  spreading it on the floor. On top of this was stretched a great sheet of  clean cloth.    Then the men began to come into the shed and catch the Sheep and carry  them into the barn. They were frightened and bleated a good deal, but  when one was caught and carried away, although he might struggle hard to  free himself, he did not open his mouth. The old Wether Sheep was the  first to be taken, and then the young ones who had been Lambs the year  before. For a long time not one of the mothers was chosen. Still, nobody  knew what would happen next, and so, the fewer Sheep there were left,  the more closely they huddled together.    At last, when the young Sheep had all been taken, one of the men caught  the mother of the twins and carried her away. She turned her face toward  her children, but the door swung shut after her, and they were left with  the other Lambs and their mothers. From the barn came the sound of  snip-snip-snipping and the murmur of men's voices. Once the twins  thought they saw their mother lying on the floor and a man kneeling  beside her, holding her head and forelegs under his arm, yet they were  not sure of this.    The brother ran to the corner of the shed and put his head against the  boards. He suddenly felt very young and helpless. \"My dear woolly  mother!\" he said to himself, over and over, and he wondered if he would  ever see her again. He remembered what he had said to her the night  before. It seemed to him that he could even now hear his own voice  saying crossly, \"Seems to me we always have to stay close to you. I  never have a bit of fun!\" He wished he had not said it. He knew she was  a dear mother, and he would have given anything in the world for a  chance to stay close to her again.    His sister felt as lonely and frightened as he, but she did not act in  the same way. She stood close to a younger Lamb whose mother had just  been taken away, and tried to comfort her. One by one the mothers were  taken until only the Lambs remained. They were very hungry now, and  bleated pitifully. Still the twin brother stood with his head in the  corner. He had closed his eyes, but now he opened them, and through a  crack in the wall of the shed, he saw some very slender and  white-looking Sheep turned into the meadow. At first they acted dizzy,  and staggered instead of walking straight; then they stopped staggering  and began to frisk. \"Can it be?\" said he. \"It surely is!\" For, although  he had never in his short life seen a newly shorn Sheep, he began to  understand what had happened.    He knew that the men had only been clipping the long wool from the  Sheep, and that they were now ready for warm weather. No wonder they  frisked when their heavy burdens of wool were carefully taken off.    Now the farmer opened the door into the barn again, and let the Lambs  walk through it to the gate of the meadow. They had never before been  inside this barn, and the twin brother looked quickly around as he  scampered across the floor. He saw some great ragged bundles of wool,  and a man was just rolling up the last fleece. He wondered if that had  been taken from his mother and was the very one against which he had  cuddled when he was cold or frightened.    When they first reached the pasture, the Lambs could not tell which  were their mothers. Shearing off their long and dingy fleeces had made  such a difference in their looks! The twin brother knew his mother by  her way of walking and by her voice, but he could see that his sister  did not know her at all. He saw his mother wandering around as though  she did not know where to find her children, and a naughty plan came  into his head. If he could keep his sister from finding their mother for  even a short time, he knew that the farmer would take her up to the pen.  He thought he knew just how to do it, and he started to run to her. Then  he stopped and remembered how sad and lonely he had been without his  mother only a little while before, and he began to pity the Lambs in the  pen.    Now his selfishness and his goodness were fighting hard in him. One  said, \"Send your sister away,\" and the other, \"Take her to your mother.\"  At last he ran as fast as he could toward his sister. \"I am good now,\"  he said to himself, \"but it may not last long. I will tell her before I  am naughty again.\"    \"Oh sister!\" cried he. \"Come with me to our mother. She doesn't know  where to find us.\"    He saw a happy look on his sister's sad little face, and he was glad  that he had done the right thing. They skipped away together, kicking up  their heels as they went, and it seemed to the brother that he had never  been so happy in his life. He was soon to be happier, though, for when  they reached his \"new, white mother,\" as he called her, and his sister  told her how he had shown her the way, his mother said, \"Now you are a  comfort to me. You will be a happier Lamb, too, for you know that a  mother's heart is large enough for all her children, and that the more  one loves, the better he loves.\"    \"Why, of course,\" said the twin sister. \"What do you mean?\"    But the mother never told her, and the brother never told her, and it is  hoped that you will keep the secret.          THE VERY SHORT STORY OF THE FOOLISH LITTLE MOUSE      The Mice who lived in the barn and around the granaries had many cousins  living on the farm who were pleasant people to know. Any one could tell  by looking at them that they were related, yet there were differences in  size, in the coloring of their fur, in their voices, and most of all in  their ways of living. Some of these cousins would come to visit at the  barn in winter, when there was little to eat in the fields. The Meadow  Mice never did this. They were friendly with the people who came from  the farmyard to graze in the meadow, yet when they were asked to return  the call, they said, \"No, thank you. We are an out-of-door family, and  we never enter houses. We do not often go to the farmyard, but we are  always glad to see you here. Come again.\"    When the Cows are in the meadow, they watch for these tiny people, and  stop short if they hear their voices from the grass near by. Of course  the Horses are careful, for Horses will never step on any person, large  or small, if they can help it. They are very particular about this.    All through the meadow you can see, if you look sharply, shallow winding  paths among the grasses, and these paths are worn by the running to and  fro of the Meadow Mice. Their homes are in stumps of trees or in the  higher ground near the ditches. In these homes the baby Meadow Mice stay  until they are large enough to go out into the great world and eat  roots, grasses, and seeds with their fathers and mothers. Sometimes they  do go out a little way with their mother before this, and they go in a  very funny fashion. Of course, when they are babies, they drink warm  milk from her body as the children of most four-legged people do.  Sometimes a young Meadow Mouse does not want to stop drinking his milk  when it is time for his mother to leave the nest, so he just hangs on to  her with his tiny, toothless mouth, and when she goes she drags him  along on the ground beside her. The ground is rather rough for such soft  little babies, and they do not go far in this way, but are glad enough  to snuggle down again with their brothers and sisters.    There is no danger of their being lonely, even when their mother is  away, for the Meadow Mice have large families, and where there are ten  babies of the same age, or even only six, which is thought a small  family among their people, it is not possible for one to feel alone.    There were two fine Meadow Mice who built their nest in the bank of a  ditch and were much liked by all their relatives. They had raised many  children to full-grown Mousehood, and were kind and wise parents. When  their children were married and had homes of their own, they still liked  to come back to visit. The father and mother were gentle and kindly, as  all Mice are, and were almost as handsome as when they first began to  gnaw. Nobody could say that he ever saw a bit of dust on either of them.    The brown fur of the upper part of their bodies and the grayish-white  fur underneath always lay sleek and tidy, and from their long whiskers  to the tips of their hairless tails, they were as dainty as possible.  That was one reason why they were so fine-looking, for you know it makes  no difference how beautiful one may be in the first place, if he does  not try to keep clean he is not pleasant to look at, while many quite  plain people are charming because they look well and happy and clean.    Now this pair of Mice had eight Mouse babies in their nest. The babies  were no larger than Bumble Bees at first and very pink. This was not  because their fur was pink, but only because it was so very short that  through it and their thin skin one saw the glow of the red blood in  their veins.    \"Did you ever see such beautiful babies?\" said their mother proudly to  her neighbors. \"They are certainly the finest I ever had.\" Her friends  smiled, for she always said the same thing whenever she had little ones.  Yet they understood, for they had children of their own, and knew that  although mothers love all alike, there is always a time when the  youngest seems the most promising. That is before they are old enough to  be naughty.    The days passed, and the eight baby Meadow Mice ate and slept and pushed  each other around, and talked in their sweet, squeaky little voices.  They were less pink every day and more the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19400"],[0,"History Of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 1 (of 12) (#9)"],[1,"to the limits of its bed. One after  another, the streams which fed it fail or dwindle. The Tacazze is  lost among the sands before rejoining it, and the Blue Nile, well-nigh  deprived of tributaries, is but scantily maintained by Abyssinian  snows. The White Nile is indebted to the Great Lakes for the greater  persistence of its waters, which feed the river as far as the  Mediterranean, and save the valley from utter drought in winter. But,  even with this resource, the level of the water falls daily, and its  volume is diminished. Long-hidden sandbanks reappear, and are again  linked into continuous line. Islands expand by the rise of shingly  beaches, which gradually reconnect them with each other and with the  shore. Smaller branches of the river cease to flow, and form a mere  network of stagnant pools and muddy ponds, which fast dry up. The main  channel itself is only intermittently navigable; after March boats run  aground in it, and are forced to await the return of the inundation for  their release. From the middle of April to the middle of June, Egypt is  only half alive, awaiting the new Nile.    [Illustration: 034.jpg ASSIOUT]    Those ruddy and heavily charged waters, rising and retiring with almost  mathematical regularity, bring and leave the spoils of the countries  they have traversed: sand from Nubia, whitish clay from the regions  of the Lakes, ferruginous mud, and the various rock-formations of  Abyssinia. These materials are not uniformly disseminated in the  deposits; their precipitation being regulated both by their specific  gravity and the velocity of the current. Flattened stones and rounded  pebbles are left behind at the cataract between Syene and Keneh, while  coarser particles of sand are suspended in the undercurrents and serve  to raise the bed of the river, or are carried out to sea and form the  sandbanks which are slowly rising at the Damietta and Rosetta mouths of  the Nile. The mud and finer particles rise towards the surface, and are  deposited upon the land after the opening of the dykes. Soil which is  entirely dependent on the deposit of a river, and periodically invaded  by it, necessarily maintains but a scanty flora; and though it is well  known that, as a general rule, a flora is rich in proportion to its  distance from the poles and its approach to the equator, it is also  admitted that Egypt offers an exception to this rule. At the most, she  has not more than a thousand species, while, with equal area, England,  for instance, possesses more than fifteen hundred; and of this thousand,  the greater number are not indigenous. Many of them have been brought  From Central Africa by the river: birds and winds have continued  the work, and man himself has contributed his part in making it more  complete. From Asia he has at different times brought wheat barley  the olive, the apple, the white or pink almond, and some twenty  other species now acclimatized on the banks of the Nile. Marsh plants  predominate in the Delta; but the papyrus, and the three varieties of  blue, white, and pink lotus which once flourished there, being no longer  cultivated, have now almost entirely disappeared, and reverted to their  original habitats.    [Illustration: 036.jpg ENTRANCE OF THE MUDIRIYEH OF ASYUT.]    The sycamore and the date-palm, both importations from Central Africa,  have better adapted themselves to their exile, and are now fully  naturalized on Egyptian soil.    [Illustration: 037.jpg FOREST OF DATE PALMS]    The sycamore grows in sand on the edge of the desert as vigorously as  in the midst of a well-watered country. Its roots go deep in search of  water, which infiltrates as far as the gorges of the hills, and they  absorb it freely, even where drought seems to reign supreme. The heavy,  squat, gnarled trunk occasionally attains to colossal dimensions,  without ever growing very high. Its rounded masses of compact foliage  are so wide-spreading that a single tree in the distance may give the  impression of several grouped together; and its shade is dense,  and impenetrable to the sun. A striking contrast to the sycamore  is presented by the date-palm. Its round and slender stem rises  uninterruptedly to a height of thirteen to sixteen yards; its head  is crowned with a cluster of flexible leaves arranged in two or three  tiers, but so scanty, so pitilessly slit, that they fail to keep off the  light, and cast but a slight and unrefreshing shadow. Few trees have so  elegant an appearance, yet few are so monotonously elegant. There are  palm trees to be seen on every hand; isolated, clustered by twos and  threes at the mouths of ravines and about the villages, planted  in regular file along the banks of the river like rows of columns,  symmetrically arranged in plantations,--these are the invariable  background against which other trees are grouped, diversifying the  landscape. The feathery tamarisk[*] and the nabk, the moringa, the  carob, or locust tree several varieties of acacia and mimosa-the sont,  the mimosa habbas, the white acacia, the Acacia Parnesxana--and  the pomegranate tree, increase in number with the distance from the  Mediterranean.         * The Egyptian name for the tamarisk, _asari, asri_, is       identical with that given to it in Semitic languages, both       ancient and modern.    This would suggest the question       whether the tamarisk did not originally come from Asia. In       that case it must have been brought to Egypt from remote       antiquity, for it figures in the  Pyramid texts.   Bricks of       Nile mud, and Memphite and Theban tombs have yielded us       leaves, twigs, and even whole branches of the tamarisk.    [Illustration: 40.jpg ACACIAS AT THE ENTRANCE TO A GARDEN OUTSIDE  EKHMIM. 1]         1 From a drawing by Boudier, from a photograph by Insinger,       taken in 1884.    The dry air of the valley is marvellously suited to them, but makes the  tissue of their foliage hard and fibrous, imparting an aerial aspect,  and such faded tints as are unknown to their growth in other climates.  The greater number of these trees do not reproduce themselves  spontaneously, and tend to disappear when neglected. The Acacia Seyal,  formerly abundant by the banks of the river, is now almost entirely  confined to certain valleys of the Theban desert, along with a variety  of the kernelled dom-palm, of which a poetical description has come  down to us from the Ancient Egyptians. The common dom-palm bifurcates at  eight or ten yards from the ground; these branches are subdivided, and  terminate in bunches of twenty to thirty palmate and fibrous leaves, six  to eight feet long. At the beginning of this century the tree was  common in Upper Egypt, but it is now becoming scarce, and we are within  measurable distance of the time when its presence will be an exception  north of the first cataract. Willows are decreasing in number, and the  persea, one of the sacred trees of Ancient Egypt, is now only to be  found in gardens. None of the remaining tree species are common enough  to grow in large clusters; and Egypt, reduced to her lofty groves of  date-palms, presents the singular spectacle of a country where there is  no lack of trees, but an almost entire absence of shade.    [Illustration: 41.jpg SHE-ASS AND HER FOAL.]    If Egypt is a land of imported flora, it is also a land of imported  fauna, and all its animal species have been brought from neighbouring  countries. Some of these--as, for example, the horse and the camel--were  only introduced at a comparatively recent period, two thousand to  eighteen hundred years before our era; the camel still later. The  animals--such as the long and short-horned oxen, together with varieties  of goats and dogs--are, like the plants, generally of African origin,  and the ass of Egypt preserves an original purity of form and a vigour  to which the European donkey has long been a stranger. The pig and  the wild boar, the long-eared hare, the hedgehog, the ichneumon, the  moufflon, or maned sheep, innumerable gazelles, including the Egyptian  gazelles, and antelopes with lyre-shaped horns, are as much West Asian  as African, like the carnivors of all sizes, whose prey they are--the  wild cat, the wolf, the jackal, the striped and spotted hyenas, the  leopard, the panther, the hunting leopard, and the lion.    [Illustration: 042.jpg THE URAEUS OF EGYPT. 1]         1 Drawn by Faucher-Gudin from pl. iii. of the Reptiles-       Supplement to the _Description de AEgypte_.    On the other hand, most of the serpents, large and small, are  indigenous. Some are harmless, like the colubers; others are venomous,  such as the soy tale, the cerastes, the haje viper, and the asp. The asp  was worshipped by the Egyptians under the name of uraeus. It occasionally  attains to a length of six and a half feet, and when approached will  erect its head and inflate its throat in readiness for darting forward.  The bite is fatal, like that of the cerastes; birds are literally struck  down by the strength of the poison, while the great mammals, and man  himself, almost invariably succumb to it after a longer or shorter  death-struggle. The uraeus is rarely found except in the desert or in the  fields; the scorpion crawls everywhere, in desert and city alike, and if  its sting is not always followed by death, it invariably causes terrible  pain. Probably there were once several kinds of gigantic serpent in  Egypt, analogous to the pythons of equatorial Africa. They are still to  be seen in representations of funerary scenes, but not elsewhere; for,  like the elephant, the giraffe, and other animals which now only thrive  far south, they had disappeared at the beginning of historic times.  The hippopotamus long maintained its ground before returning to those  equatorial regions whence it had been brought by the Nile. Common under  the first dynasties, but afterwards withdrawing to the marshes of the  Delta, it there"]]]
