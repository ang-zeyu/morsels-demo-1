Three other firms brewed close on a  million barrels or upwards. The quantity of malt used was 51,818,697  bushels; of unmalted corn, 125,671 bushels; of rice, flaked maize and  similar materials, 1,348,558 cwt.; of sugar, 2,746,615 cwt.; of hops,  62,360,817 lb; and of hop substitutes, 49,202 lb. The average specific  gravity of the beer produced in 1905-1906 was 1053.24. The quantity of beer  exported was 520,826; of beer imported, 57,194 barrels. It is curious to  note that the figures for exports and imports had remained almost  stationary for the last thirty years. By far the greater part of the beer  brewed is consumed in England. Thus of the total quantity retained for  consumption in 1905-1906, 28,590,563 barrels were consumed in England,  1,648,463 in Scotland, and 3,265,084 in Ireland. In 1871 it was calculated  by Professor Leone Levi that the capital invested in the liquor trade in  the United Kingdom was L117,000,000. In 1908 this figure might be safely  doubled. A writer in the _Brewers' Almanack_ for 1906 placed the capital  invested in limited liability breweries alone at L185,000,000. If we allow  for over-capitalization, it seems fairly safe to say that, prior to the  introduction of the Licensing Bill of 1908, the market value of the  breweries in the United Kingdom, together with their licensed property, was  in the neighbourhood of L120,000,000, to which might be added another  L20,000,000 for the value of licences not included in the above  calculation; the total capital actually sunk in the whole liquor trade  (including the wine and spirit industries and trades) being probably not  far short of L250,000,000, and the number of persons directly engaged in or  dependent on the liquor trade being under-estimated at 2,000,000. (For  comparative production and consumption see BEER.)    _Taxation and Regulations_.--The development of the brewing industry in  England is intimately interwoven with the history of its taxation, and the  regulations which have from time to time been formed for the safeguarding  of the revenue. The first duty on beer in the United Kingdom was imposed in  the reign of Charles II. (1660), namely 2s. 6d. per barrel on strong and  6d. per barrel on weak beer. This was gradually increased, amounting to 4s.  9d. on strong and 1s. 3d. on weak beer in the last decade of the 17th  century, and to 8s. to 10s. in the year 1800, at which rate it continued  until the repeal of the beer duty in 1830. A duty on malt was first imposed  in the reign of William III. (1697), and from that date until 1830 both  beer duty and malt tax were charged. The rate at first was under 7d. per  bushel, but this was increased up to 2s. 7d. prior to the first repeal of  the beer duty (1830), and to 4s. 6d. after the repeal. In 1829 the joint  beer and malt taxes amounted to no less than 13s. 8d. per barrel, or 41/2d.  per gallon, as against 21/2d. at the present day. From 1856 until the  abolition of the malt tax, the latter remained constant at a fraction under  2s. 81/2d. A _hop duty_ varying from 1d. to 21/2d. per pound was in existence  between 1711 and 1862. One of the main reasons for the abolition of the hop  duty was the fact that, owing to the uncertainty of the crop, the amount  paid to the revenue was subject to wide fluctuations. Thus in 1855 the  revenue from this source amounted to L728,183, in 1861 to only L149,700.    It was not until 1847 that the use of sugar in brewing was permitted, and  in 1850 the first sugar tax, amounting to 1s. 4d. per cwt., was imposed. It  varied from this figure up to 6s. 6d. in 1854, and in 1874, when the  general duty on sugar was repealed, it was raised to 11s. 6d., at which  rate it remained until 1880, when it was repealed simultaneously with the  malt duty. In 1901 a general sugar tax of 4s. 2d. and under (according to  the percentage of actual sugar contained) was imposed, but no drawback was  allowed to brewers using sugar, and therefore--and this obtains at the  present day--sugar used in brewing pays the general tax and also the beer  duty.    By the Free Mash-Tun Act of 1880, the duty was taken off the malt and  placed on the beer, or, more properly speaking, on the wort; maltsters' and  brewers' licences were repealed, and in lieu thereof an annual licence duty  of L1 payable by every brewer for sale was [v.04 p.0507] imposed. The chief  feature of this act was that, on and after the 1st of October 1880, a beer  duty was imposed in lieu of the old malt tax, at the rate of 6s. 3d. per  barrel of 36 gallons, at a specific gravity of 1.057, and the regulations  for charging the duty were so framed as to leave the brewer practically  unrestricted as to the description of malt or corn and sugar, or other  description of saccharine substitutes (other than deleterious articles or  drugs), which he might use in the manufacture or colouring of beer. This  freedom in the choice of materials has continued down to the present time,  except that the use of \"saccharin\" (a product derived from coal-tar) was  prohibited in 1888, the reason being that this substance gives an apparent  palate-fulness to beer equal to roughly 4 deg. in excess of its real gravity,  the revenue suffering thereby. In 1889 the duty on beer was increased by a  reduction in the standard of gravity from 1.057 to 1.055, and in 1894 a  further 6d. per barrel was added. The duty thus became 6s. 9d. per barrel,  at a gravity of 1.055, which was further increased to 7s. 9d. per barrel by  the war budget of 1900, at which figure it stood in 1909. (See also LIQUOR  LAWS.)    Prior to 1896, rice, flaked maize (see below), and other similar  preparations had been classed as malt or corn in reference to their  wort-producing powers, but after that date they were deemed sugar[1] in  that regard. By the new act (1880) 42 lb weight of corn, or 28 lb weight of  sugar, were to be deemed the equivalent of a bushel of malt, and a brewer  was expected by one of the modes of charge to have brewed at least a barrel  (36 gallons) of worts (less 4% allowed for wastage) at the standard gravity  for every two bushels of malt (or its equivalents) used by him in brewing;  but where, owing to lack of skill or inferior machinery, a brewer cannot  obtain the standard quantity of wort from the standard equivalent of  material, the charge is made not on the wort, but directly on the material.  By the new act, licences at the annual duty of L1 on brewers for sale, and  of 6s. (subsequently modified by 44 Vict. c. 12, and 48 and 49 Vict. c. 5,  &c., to 4s.) or 9s., as the case might be, on any other brewers, were  required. The regulations dealing with the mashing operations are very  stringent. Twenty-four hours at least before mashing the brewer must enter  in his brewing book (provided by the Inland Revenue) the day and hour for  commencing to mash malt, corn, &c., or to dissolve sugar; and the date of  making such entry; and also, two hours at least before the notice hour for  mashing, the quantity of malt, corn, &c., and sugar to be used, and the day  and hour when all the worts will be drawn off the grains in the mash-tun.  The worts of each brewing must be collected within twelve hours of the  commencement of the collection, and the brewer must within a given time  enter in his book the quantity and gravity of the worts before  fermentation, the number and name of the vessel, and the date of the entry.  The worts must remain in the same vessel undisturbed for twelve hours after  being collected, unless previously taken account of by the officer. There  are other regulations, _e.g._ those prohibiting the mixing of worts of  different brewings unless account has been taken of each separately, the  alteration of the size or shape of any gauged vessel without notice, and so  on.    _Taxation of Beer in Foreign Countries_.--The following table shows the  nature of the tax and the amount of the same calculated to English barrels.

MATERIALS USED IN BREWING.--These are water, malt (_q.v._), hops (_q.v._),  various substitutes for the two latter, and preservatives.    _Water_.--A satisfactory supply of water--which, it may here be mentioned,  is always called _liquor_ in the brewery--is a matter of great importance  to the brewer. Certain waters, for instance, those contaminated to any  extent with organic matter, cannot be used at all in brewing, as they give  rise to unsatisfactory fermentation, cloudiness and abnormal flavour.  Others again, although suited to the production of one type of beer, are  quite unfit for the brewing of another. For black beers a soft water is a  desideratum, for ales of the Burton type a hard water is a necessity. For  the brewing of mild ales, again, a water containing a certain proportion of  chlorides is required. The presence or absence of certain mineral  substances as such in the finished beer is not, apparently, a matter of any  moment as regards flavour or appearance, but the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#9)"],[1," the  waiting car, shouting an address to the man.    Piccadilly was gay with supper-bound theatre crowds when he leapt out  and ran into the hall-way which had been the scene of Robert's meeting  with Myra Duquesne. Dr. Cairn ran past the lift doors and went up the  stairs three steps at a time. He pressed his finger to the bell-push  beside Antony Ferrara's door and held it there until the door opened  and a dusky face appeared in the opening.    The visitor thrust his way in, past the white-clad man holding out his  arms to detain him.    \"Not at home, _effendim_--\"    Dr. Cairn shot out a sinewy hand, grabbed the man--he was a tall  _fellahin_--by the shoulder, and sent him spinning across the mosaic  floor of the _mandarah_. The air was heavy with the perfume of  ambergris.    Wasting no word upon the reeling man, Dr. Cairn stepped to the  doorway. He jerked the drapery aside and found himself in a dark  corridor. From his son's description of the chambers he had no  difficulty in recognising the door of the study.    He turned the handle--the door proved to be unlocked--and entered the  darkened room.    In the grate a huge fire glowed redly; the temperature of the place  was almost unbearable. On the table the light from the silver lamp  shed a patch of radiance, but the rest of the study was veiled in  shadow.    A black-robed figure was seated in a high-backed, carved chair; one  corner of the cowl-like garment was thrown across the table. Half  rising, the figure turned--and, an evil apparition in the glow from  the fire, Antony Ferrara faced the intruder.    Dr. Cairn walked forward, until he stood over the other.    \"Uncover what you have on the table,\" he said succinctly.    Ferrara's strange eyes were uplifted to the speaker's with an  expression in their depths which, in the Middle Ages, alone would have  sent a man to the stake.    \"Dr. Cairn--\"    The husky voice had lost something of its suavity.    \"You heard my order!\"    \"Your _order_! Surely, doctor, since I am in my own--\"    \"Uncover what you have on the table. Or must I do so for you!\"    Antony Ferrara placed his hand upon the end of the black robe which  lay across the table.    \"Be careful, Dr. Cairn,\" he said evenly. \"You--are taking risks.\"    Dr. Cairn suddenly leapt, seized the shielding hand in a sure grip and  twisted Ferrara's arm behind him. Then, with a second rapid movement,  he snatched away the robe. A faint smell--a smell of corruption, of  ancient rottenness--arose on the superheated air.    A square of faded linen lay on the table, figured with all but  indecipherable Egyptian characters, and upon it, in rows which formed  a definite geometrical design, were arranged a great number of little,  black insects.    Dr. Cairn released the hand which he held, and Ferrara sat quite  still, looking straight before him.    \"_Dermestes beetles!_ from the skull of a mummy! You filthy, obscene  beast!\"    Ferrara spoke, with a calm suddenly regained:    \"Is there anything obscene in the study of beetles?\"    \"My son saw these things here yesterday; and last night, and again  to-night, you cast magnified doubles--glamours--of the horrible  creatures into his rooms! By means which you know of, but which _I_  know of, too, you sought to bring your thought-things down to the  material plane.\"    \"Dr. Cairn, my respect for you is great; but I fear that much study  has made you mad.\"    Ferrara reached out his hand towards an ebony box; he was smiling.    \"Don't dare to touch that box!\"    He paused, glancing up.    \"More orders, doctor?\"    \"Exactly.\"    Dr. Cairn grabbed the faded linen, scooping up the beetles within it,  and, striding across the room, threw the whole unsavoury bundle into  the heart of the fire. A great flame leapt up; there came a series of  squeaky explosions, so that, almost, one might have imagined those  age-old insects to have had life. Then the doctor turned again.    Ferrara leapt to his feet with a cry that had in it something inhuman,  and began rapidly to babble in a tongue that was not European. He was  facing Dr. Cairn, a tall, sinister figure, but one hand was groping  behind him for the box.    \"Stop that!\" rapped the doctor imperatively--\"and for the last time do  not dare to touch that box!\"    The flood of strange words was dammed. Ferrara stood quivering, but  silent.    \"The laws by which such as you were burnt--the _wise_ laws of long  ago--are no more,\" said Dr. Cairn. \"English law cannot touch you, but  God has provided for your kind!\"    \"Perhaps,\" whispered Ferrara, \"you would like also to burn this box to  which you object so strongly?\"    \"No power on earth would prevail upon me to touch it! But you--you  _have_ touched it--and you know the penalty! You raise forces of evil  that have lain dormant for ages and dare to wield them. Beware! I know  of some whom you have murdered; I cannot know how many you have sent  to the madhouse. But I swear that in future your victims shall be few.  There is a way to deal with you!\"    He turned and walked to the door.    \"Beware also, dear Dr. Cairn,\" came softly. \"As you say, I raise  forces of evil--\"    Dr. Cairn spun about. In three strides he was standing over Antony  Ferrara, fists clenched and his sinewy body tense in every fibre. His  face was pale, as was apparent even in that vague light, and his eyes  gleamed like steel.    \"You raise other forces,\" he said--and his voice, though steady was  very low; \"evil forces, also.\"    Antony Ferrara, invoker of nameless horrors, shrank before him--before  the primitive Celtic man whom unwittingly he had invoked. Dr. Cairn  was spare and lean, but in perfect physical condition. Now he was  strong, with the strength of a just cause. Moreover, he was dangerous,  and Ferrara knew it well.    \"I fear--\" began the latter huskily.    \"Dare to bandy words with me,\" said Dr. Cairn, with icy coolness,  \"answer me back but once again, and before God I'll strike you dead!\"    Ferrara sat silent, clutching at the arms of his chair, and not daring  to raise his eyes. For ten magnetic seconds they stayed so, then again  Dr. Cairn turned, and this time walked out.    The clocks had been chiming the quarter after eleven as he had entered  Antony Ferrara's chambers, and some had not finished their chimes when  his son, choking, calling wildly upon Heaven to aid him, had fallen in  the midst of crowding, obscene things, and, in the instant of his  fall, had found the room clear of the waving antennae, the beady eyes,  and the beetle shapes. The whole horrible phantasmagoria--together  with the odour of ancient rottenness--faded like a fevered dream, at  the moment that Dr. Cairn had burst in upon the creator of it.    Robert Cairn stood up, weakly, trembling; then dropped upon his knees  and sobbed out prayers of thankfulness that came from his frightened  soul.          CHAPTER VII    SIR ELWIN GROVES' PATIENT      When a substantial legacy is divided into two shares, one of which  falls to a man, young, dissolute and clever, and the other to a girl,  pretty and inexperienced, there is laughter in the hells. But, to the  girl's legacy add another item--a strong, stern guardian, and the  issue becomes one less easy to predict.    In the case at present under consideration, such an arrangement led  Dr. Bruce Cairn to pack off Myra Duquesne to a grim Scottish manor in  Inverness upon a visit of indefinite duration. It also led to heart  burnings on the part of Robert Cairn, and to other things about to be  noticed.    Antony Ferrara, the co-legatee, was not slow to recognise that a  damaging stroke had been played, but he knew Dr. Cairn too well to put  up any protest. In his capacity of fashionable physician, the doctor  frequently met Ferrara in society, for a man at once rich, handsome,  and bearing a fine name, is not socially ostracised on the mere  suspicion that he is a dangerous blackguard. Thus Antony Ferrara was  courted by the smartest women in town and tolerated by the men. Dr.  Cairn would always acknowledge him, and then turn his back upon the  dark-eyed, adopted son of his dearest friend.    There was that between the two of which the world knew nothing. Had  the world known what Dr. Cairn knew respecting Antony Ferrara, then,  despite his winning manner, his wealth and his station, every door in  London, from those of Mayfair to that of the foulest den in Limehouse,  would have been closed to him--closed, and barred with horror and  loathing. A tremendous secret was locked up within the heart of Dr.  Bruce Cairn.    Sometimes we seem to be granted a glimpse of the guiding Hand that  steers men's destinies; then, as comprehension is about to dawn, we  lose again our temporal lucidity of vision. The following incident  illustrates this.    Sir Elwin Groves, of Harley Street, took Dr. Cairn aside at the club  one evening.    \"I am passing a patient on to you, Cairn,\" he said; \"Lord Lashmore.\"    \"Ah!\" replied Cairn, thoughtfully. \"I have never met him.\"    \"He has only quite recently returned to England--you may have  heard?--and brought a South American Lady Lashmore with him.\"    \"I had heard that, yes.\"    \"Lord Lashmore is close upon fifty-five, and his wife--a passionate  Southern type--is probably less than twenty. They are an odd couple.  The lady has been doing some extensive entertaining at the town  house.\"    Groves stared hard at Dr. Cairn.    \"Your young friend, Antony Ferrara, is a regular visitor.\"    \"No doubt,\" said Cairn; \"he goes everywhere. I don't know how long his  funds will last.\"    \"I have wondered, too. His chambers are like a scene from the 'Arabian  Nights.'\"    \"How do you know?\" inquired the other curiously. \"Have you attended  him?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"His Eastern servant 'phoned for me one night  last week; and I found Ferrara lying unconscious in a room like a  pasha's harem. He looked simply ghastly, but the man would give me no  account of what had caused the attack."]]]
