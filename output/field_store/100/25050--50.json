This also took time, though she worked at fever-pitch, almost with  fury; but she managed to finish it, and fly away into the landscape in  a remarkably short while, considering.    Here once again she appeared to be searching for something through the  yellow sunshine and the falling blossom-petals--confetti from Spring's  wedding.  And presently she found it, or seemed to--an old gate, off  its hinges.  But the wood was rotting, and she was no fool.  She knew  her job--the job she had never done before, by the way--and after  humming around it in a fretful, undecided sort of fashion for some  while, she flew on.  Apparently she was looking for wood, but not _any_  wood.  Cut wood appeared to be her desire, and that oak; at least, she  put behind her a deal board lying half-overgrown, after one careful  professional inspection.    Her way was through a perilous world, beset by a thousand foes, mostly  in the nature of traps and lines and barbed-wire entanglements set by  spiders.  As a rule you didn't see these last at all--nor did she; but  her yellow-and-black badge usually won her a way of respect--and  hate--and she cut or struggled herself clear of such web-lines as her  feelers failed to spot in time.    At last she found some real oak rails, and set to work upon them at  once, planing with her sharp shear-jaws.  A tiger-beetle, gaudy and  hungry-eyed, sought to pounce upon her in this task.  He was  long-legged, and keen, and lean, and very swift; but she shot aloft  just in time; and when she came down again, with a z-zzzzp, as quickly  as she went up, sting first, he had wisely dodged into a cranny, where  he defied her with open and jagged jaws.    Again getting to work, she planed off a pellet of good sound wood--it  looked like a nail-scrape, the mark she made--and masticating it and  moistening it with saliva, whirred back like a homing aeroplane to her  city in the making.    There was a whir and a buzz as she passed through the portals of her  main gate from the light of day, and she reappeared again, backing out,  \"looking daggers,\" as we say, and brandishing her poisoned dart--her  sting, if you insist, on the end of her tail--in the air.  But she  still hung on to her pellet.    Presumably some unlucky visitor had called in her absence.  More sounds  of concentrated argument followed, and finally there fell out, rather  than rushed out, a small and amazingly slender black wasp, one of those  hermits who seem to consecrate their lives to lonely working for a  family they never see.  This unhappy one slid down the bank, curled up  at the bottom, uncurled, curled up again, and--remained curled.  Apparently _her_ day's work was done, which comes of falling foul of  the yellow flag.    Arrived inside, at her hallowed chamber, our queen carefully selected a  rootlet in the roof--not just any old rootlet, mark you; never any  \"old\" anything, you will notice, but a good, sound, well-found rootlet  that you could hang five or six pounds' weight to; indeed, three  rootlets before she had finished.  To these rootlets she  fastened--gummed would be a more correct word--her pellet of  wasp-paper, in the form of a thin layer, and hurried away, singing, for  more.  This was, so to speak, the foundation-stone of the city, laid,  be it noticed, not haphazard--our queen never did any business that  way--but with mathematical regard as to what was to follow.  In very  fact, too, it was the foundation-stone of her city, only upside-down,  though that is nothing.  Wasps always do things that way, which is  unlike ants, those other and greater city builders.    Back came the queen very soon with another load, and pasted  that--thin--to the first layer, hurrying, bustling, humming a happy  song continuously to herself.  Then away again for more, and in the  process to a lively battle with a robber-fly, who appeared set upon  robbing her of her blood.  It tried, like the beetle, to stalk her and  pounce upon her back, what time she was planing out wood for  paper-pulp; but her back wasn't there when it pounced, and her jaws  were.  It \"waited on,\" hovering like a falcon, and twice as keen, and  when she got to work again, dropped like a hurled lance-head, only to  be met with jaws, wide and ready, as before.    It went away, watching from afar--far for an insect--from \"the little  speedwell's darling blue\" upon the hedge-bank, and just as she was  moistening the load, gathered ready to fly off, delivered its final  ultimatum--a marvelously persistent murderer.  This time it, or,  rather, she, was received with the point--the poisoned point--and,  turning like a spent lightning-flash to avoid it, found the queen hard  on her heels, following all down the gay hedge-ditch, humming high, in  nearly a shriek of rage.  Finally, she turned, to do battle for her  life, and the two, grappling, fell as shooting-stars fall, gleaming,  athwart the sun, with a brrr-r like a fused wire, and finished the job,  rolling over and over on the ground--rolling over and over among the  stalks of bluebells, like the heavens \"upraising from the earth.\"    It is written, however, that few in the insect world can withstand a  queen of the yellow devils, and in a few seconds the wasp got up and  flew home again, quite unperturbed.  The robber-fly did not get up, and  she was not quite unperturbed, but died as they die who are poisoned  with formic acid, and very soon was still.    By the time the shadows crept across the entrance to the derelict  mole-hole, warning the wasp back--for your true wasp is a worshiper of  the sun--the queen had formed a disc of paper, and suspended  there-from, in the middle, a stalk, also of paper, which widened out at  its base, and became, as it were, the outlines of four six-sided cells.  The cells were in the shape of a cross--that cross which you will  always find at the foundation of the cities of the waspfolk, and, in a  way, a sign or mark of their nationality--the cross in the  market-square, so to speak, outwards from which the city grew.    The queen, satisfied apparently with her new city so far, hung up and  went to sleep.  When anything or anybody came to prospect for house  lots, or edible victims, during the still, silent, silver night, she  hummed very severely, like an electric fan, to let the intruders know  who she was, and they mostly backed out again in a hurry.  If they took  a step nearer the hum rose an octave, and became very wicked, and that,  so far as most of them were concerned, finished it.    Two, however, there were who would not take even that hint.  One was a  shrew-mouse, thirsting for blood, but who got poison instead, and next  morning was found running about with his mouth somewhere concealed  behind his ear, if one may be pardoned the expression, in consequence;  and the other was a carnivorous beetle, in black, purple-shot armor,  and armed with jaws toothed like lobsters' claws.  The queen took some  nasty scars from those same jaws before she got home with the poisoned  point, a clean thrust 'twist breastplate and armlet, and the invader  doubled up on the spot where he was, and had to be dragged out in the  morning--not the dawning, for the sun had well stoked up before our  wasp would have anything to do with him.    [Illustration: \"A shrew-mouse, thirsting for blood, but who got poison  instead\"]    She found the day already in full swing when she rose, buzzing, from  her front-gate, late--for wasps hate early morning chill, like Red  Indians--and, circling once, swung straight away.  She jumped into full  hustle right off, you see.  She did not merely work; she superworked.  Forced to short hours by her constitution, she had to make up for it in  the time she got, and she did.  She allowed nothing to stop her.  If  anything tried to, she mostly stopped it, for there was no compromise  about this nation-builder; she reached her goal every time.    It was on this journey that a spotted fly-catcher, sitting on a  gatepost, made a Euclid figure at her in midair as she passed.  She had  not power to fight the bird's beak, and her poison-dagger was useless  here; nor do fly-catchers often miss.  This, however, was an occasion  when one of them did--by an eighth of an inch--and only some  electric-spark-like dodging on the part of the insect in the air made  even that one miss possible.  It was so quick, you could not see what  happened.    That day the cross of cells in this budding city was developed further,  and a low wall built round each cell.  Moreover, more cells were built,  always taking the cross as the center of all things--six-sided cells,  with a low, incomplete wall, or, rather, parapet, partitioning each  off, to the number of about twenty-four cells in all.  Each cell was  closed, of course, at the top, the top being its floor, and open at the  bottom, the bottom being, if I may so put it, the top; for, as has  already been said, wasp cities are built upside-down, and everybody  walks and hangs on his head, being so fitted for the purpose.  If you  don't hang, you tumble straight down into the scooped-out cavity below;  but nobody ever does that till he dies, for that cavity is at once the  cemetery and the refuse-heap and the dust-bin of the city, a haunt of  tiny ghouls--beetle, spider, and fly ghouls--and other loathsome  horrors, the scavengers, hyenas, vultures, and jackals of the wasp  world.    Now, after making the first cell, or, rather, the part cell, with its  low parapet, the queen laid an egg--it was very minute, that  egg--inside the cell, gumming it against the top, on the angle nearest  the center of the city.  It had to be cemented there; otherwise it  would have fallen out.    In the next cell she laid an egg, too, cementing it up to the top in  the same manner--always in the angle nearest the center of the  city--and in the next another egg, and so on, up to the twenty-four or  so.

We could never  adjust our tones to that delicate fineness so much appreciated, which  gives to the instrument its surpassing brilliancy.    ~Beats, Waves, Pulsations.~--To obtain absolute accuracy the tuner is  guided by beats, waves or pulsations. These three words refer to one  and the same thing, a phenomenon that occurs in certain intervals when  two tones are sounded together that are not in exact tune. These terms  must not be confounded with the term \"sound wave\" or \"vibrations\" so  often used in discussions on the theory of sound. However, we think  the student is thoroughly familiar with these terms. The rate of  vibration of two tones not in a favorable ratio, may produce the  phenomenon known as \"beats, waves, or pulsations.\" Vibrations may  exist either with or without pulsations.    These pulsations are most perceptible in the unison, the octave and  the fifth. They are more easily perceived in the unison than in the  octave, and more easily in the octave than in the fifth. They are also  perceptible in the perfect fourth, the major and minor third and some  other intervals, but on account of their obscurity, and because these  intervals are unnecessary in tuning they have long since been  abandoned in \"temperament making\" (with the exception of the perfect  fourth) by most tuners, although a few still make use of it. We do not  say that the fourth is unsafe to tune by, but you will see later on  why it is not best to make use of it.    _The Fischer System_ or method of \"setting the temperament\" has these  advantages: It uses but two kinds of intervals: the fifth and octave;  by employing two whole octaves in place of one or one and a half,  nearly all of the middle section of strings is brought up in pitch  which insures that the temperament will stand better while the  remaining strings are being tuned; and the alternate tuning of the  fifth and octave makes the system exceedingly easy to learn, enabling  the tuner to work with less mental strain. Also the two-octave system  gives a greater compass for testing, thus insuring greater accuracy.    If you have access to a piano, it will now be well for you to begin  training the ear to perceive the pulsations. If you cannot use a  piano, you can train very well by the use of a mandolin, guitar,  violin, zither, or any stringed instrument. An instrument with metal  strings, however, is better, as the vibrations are more perfect.    You will, of course, know that the front top panel of the case has to  be removed to give access to the tuning pins, and that you should have  a regular tuning hammer and set of mutes to begin with. The panel is  held in place in various ways: sometimes with buttons, sometimes with  pins set in slots, and sometimes with patent fastenings; but a little  examination will reveal how it may be removed.    To produce a tone of a certain pitch, the string must be of the right  thickness and length. These items are decided by the scale draughtsman  in the factory; if incorrect, the tuner can do nothing to improve  them.    To produce the correct pitch, the string must be of the right tension,  which is brought about by winding one end of the string around the  tuning pin until the proper degree of tension is reached. This must be  decided by the ear of the tuner. Two strings of equal thickness and  equal length produce the same tone when brought to the same tension;  the result being known as \"unison.\" A defect in the unison being the  easiest way in which to detect the beats, we advise that the student  practice on it first.    After taking out the panel, the first thing to do is to place your  rubber mute between two trios of strings (if the piano is an upright  which usually has three strings to a note) so that only two strings  sound when the key is struck. Select some key near the middle of the  keyboard. Strike the key strongly and hold it down. If the two  sounding strings give forth a smooth, unwavering tone--a tone that  sounds as if it came from one string, the unison is perfect. If you  find it so, remove the mute and place it on the other side of the trio  of strings. If the piano has been tuned recently by an expert, you may  have to continue your search over several keys before you find an  imperfect unison; but you will rarely find a piano in such perfect  tune that it will not contain some defective unisons. However, if you  do not succeed in finding a defective unison, select a key near the  middle of the key-board, place your mute so that but two strings  sound, and with your tuning hammer loosen one of the strings very  slightly. Now you will notice a throbbing, beating sound, very unlike  the tone produced when the strings were in exact unison. See if you  can count the beats. If you have lowered the tension too much, the  beats will be too rapid to permit counting. Now with a steady and  gradual pull, with the heel of the hand against some stationary part,  bring the string up slowly. You will notice these waves become slower  and slower. When they become quite slow, stop and count, or wave the  hand in time with the pulsations. After practicing this until you are  sure your ear has become accustomed to the beats and will recognize  them again, you may proceed to perfect the unison. Bring the string up  gradually as before, and when the unison is reached you will hear one  single, simple, musical tone, as though it were from a single string.  Never have more than two strings sounding at once. You might go over  the entire key-board now and correct all the unisons if the scale is  yet fairly good. See which string is, in your opinion, the nearest to  correctness with respect to the scale, and tune the other one, or two,  as the case may be, to it. If the scale is badly out of symmetry, you  will not get very good results without setting a temperament; but the  tones will sound better individually. This experiment is more for  practice than for improving the piano.    _The cause_ of the waves in a defective unison is the alternate  recurring of the periods when the condensations and rarefactions  correspond in the two strings and then antagonize. This is known in  physics as \"interference of sound-waves.\"    ~The Octave.~--When perfectly tuned, the upper tone of the octave has  exactly double the number of vibrations of the lower. If the lower  tone vibrates 1000 per second, the upper will vibrate 2000. Of course,  the ear cannot ascertain in any way the number of vibrations per  second; we use these figures for scientific demonstration only.  However, there is an instrument called the Siren which is constructed  for the purpose of ascertaining the number of vibrations per second of  any given tone, and which is delicately accurate in its work. By its  assistance we know, definitely, a great many things regarding our  musical scale of which we would otherwise be ignorant. But, while we  cannot, by the ear, ascertain these numbers, we can, by the  \"interference of sound-waves\" above referred to, ascertain, to the  most delicate point, when the relative vibration of two strings is  mathematically exact, if they are tuned to a unison, octave, fifth,  etc.    Practice now on tuning the octave. Find an octave in which the upper  tone is flat. Mute all but one string in the lower tone to make sure  of getting a pure tone, then select one string (the middle one if a  piano has three strings) of the upper octave and proceed to pull it up  gradually until all beats disappear. This being done, bring up the  unisons.    ~The Fifth.~--In our system, when we speak of a fifth, we mean a fifth  upward. The fifth to C is G, to G is D, and so on.    The vibration of the fifth is one and a half times that of its  fundamental. If a certain F vibrates 100, the C, a fifth above, will  vibrate 150, if tuned so that no waves are heard; but for reasons  which will be fully explained later, the fifth cannot be tuned with  mathematical precision. On account of certain peculiarities in our  tempered scale, the fifth must always be left somewhat flatter than  perfect. This fact is always learned with some astonishment by  beginners.    In your practice on tuning the fifth, first tune it perfectly, so that  no waves are perceptible; then flat it so that there are very slow  waves; less than one per second. Some authorities say there should be  three beats in five seconds; but the tuner must learn to determine  this by his own judgment. The tempering of the fifth will be treated  exhaustively in subsequent lessons.    We advise that you confine your practice to the unison until you are  sure you have a clear conception of its peculiarities in all portions  of the key-board, except the extreme lower and upper octaves; do not  try these yet. Do not begin to practice on the octave until you are  very familiar with the beats in the unison. By gradual progress you  will avoid confusing the ear, each step being thoroughly mastered  before advancing to the next. Remember, there is nothing that is  extremely difficult in learning to tune if you but understand what has  to be done, go about it systematically, and have plenty of patience.    In this lesson we give you our system of setting the temperament; that  is, the succession in which the different tones of the temperament are  tuned. We advise, however, that you do not attempt to set a  temperament until after studying Lesson IX, which enters into the  theory of temperament, testing, etc.    Two octaves are used for the temperament: an octave above, and an  octave below middle C. Middle C can be told by its being, the C  nearest the name of the piano on the name board. In other words, it  is the fifth C from the highest C, and the fourth from the lowest in  the modern piano, which has seven and a third octaves."]]]
