Signe, perched on the  top of the two-wheeled cart, was also going home. Hr. Bogstad, mounted  on his horse, accompanied them a short distance, then rode off in  another direction.          V.      \"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?\"--_Amos 3:3_      It was nearly noon when Signe Dahl sprang from the cart, and with her  bundle under her arm, ran down the hillside into the woods, following a  well-beaten trail. That was the short cut home. Hans had found her poor  company during the ride, and even now, alone in the woods, the serious  countenance was loth to relax. A ten minutes' walk brought her to the  brow of a hill, and she sauntered down its sloping side. Signe had  nearly reached home, and being doubtful of her reception there, she  lingered. Then, too, she could usually amuse herself alone, for she  always found some new wonder in the exhaustless beauty of her  surroundings.    She threw herself on a green bank, and this is the picture which she  saw: Just before her, the greensward extended down to a lake, whose  waters lost themselves behind cliffs and islands and pine-clad hills.  Here and there in the distance towards the north, there could be seen  shining spots of water; but towards the south the hills closed in  precipitously, and left room only for the outlet of the lake to pour  over its rocky bed into another valley below. On the farther shore, five  miles distant, a few red farm houses stood out from the plats of  green--all the rest was forest and rock. The sky was filled with soft,  fleecy clouds, and not a breath stirred the surface of the lake. Signe  gazed towards a rocky island before her. Only the roof of the house  upon it could be seen, but from its chimney arose no smoke. That was  where Signe had been born, and had lived most of the eighteen years of  her life. The girl walked down the hillside to the lake and again seated  herself, this time on a rock near the edge of the water. She took a book  from her bundle and began to read; but the text was soon embellished  with marginal sketches of rocks and bits of scenery, and then both  reading and drawing had to give place to the consideration of the  pictures that came thronging into her mind.    Hr. Bogstad had actually proposed to her--the rich and handsome Hr.  Bogstad; and she, the insignificant farmer girl, had refused him, had  run away from him. Signe Dahl, she ruminated, aren't you the most  foolish child in the world? He is the owner of miles and miles of the  land about here. The hills with their rich harvest of timber, the rivers  with their fish, and even the island in the lake, are his. To be  mistress over it all--ah, what a temptation. If she had only loved Hr.  Bogstad, if she had only liked him; but she did neither. She could not  explain the reason, but she knew that she could not be his wife.    How could such a man love her, anyway? Was she really so very good  looking? Signe looked down into the still, deep water and saw her own  reflection asking the question over again. There! her face, at least,  was but a little, ordinary pink and white one. Her eyes were of the  common blue color. Her hair--well, it was a trifle wavy and more glossy  than that of other girls, but--gluck! a stone broke her mirror into a  hundred circling waves. Signe looked up with a start. There was Hagbert  standing half concealed behind a bush.    \"Oh, I see you,\" she shouted.    He came down to the water, grinning good-naturedly.    \"Well,\" said he, \"I didn't think you were so vain as all that.\"    \"Can't a person look at the pebbles and fish at at the bottom of the  lake without being vain?\" and she laughed her confusion away. \"Say,  Hagbert, is your boat close by?\"    \"Yes, just down by the north landing.\"    \"Oh, that's good. I thought I would have to wait until father came this  evening to get home. You'll row me across, won't you?\"    \"Why, certainly; but I thought you had gone to the _saeter_ to stay, at  least a week.\"    \"Yes, but--but, I've come home again, you see.\"    \"Yes, I see,\" and he looked oddly at her. He had also seen Hr. Bogstad  set out for the mountains two days before, and now he wondered.    Hagbert fetched the boat, took in his passenger, and his strong arms  soon sent the light craft to the other bank.    \"A thousand thanks, Hagbert,\" she said, as she sprang out, and then  climbed up the steep path, and watched him pull back. He was a strong,  handsome fellow, too, a poor fisherman, yet somehow, she felt easier in  his company than in Hr. Bogstad's.    Signe found no one at home. Her mother and the children had, no doubt,  gone to the mainland to pick blueberries; so she went out into the  garden to finish her book. She became so absorbed in her reading that  she did not see her mother's start of surprise when they came home with  their baskets full of berries.    \"Well, well, Signe, is that you? What's the matter?\" exclaimed her  mother.    \"Nothing, mother; only I couldn't stay up there any longer.\" And that  was all the explanation her mother could get until the father came home  that evening. He was tired and a little cross. From Hans he had heard a  bit of gossip that irritated him, and Signe saw that her secret was not  wholly her own. She feared her father.    \"Signe,\" said he, after supper, \"I can guess pretty well why you came  home so soon. I had a talk with Hr. Bogstad before he went to the  _saeter_.\"    The girl's heart beat rapidly, but she said nothing.    \"Did he speak to you about--why did you run away from him, girl?\"    \"Father, you know I don't like Hr. Bogstad. I don't know why; he is nice  and all that, but I don't like him anyway.\"    \"You have such nonsensical ideas!\" exclaimed the father, and he paused  before her in his impatient pacing back and forth. \"He, the gentleman,  the possessor of thousands. Girl, do you know what you are doing when  you act like this? Can't you see that we are poor; that your father is  worked to death to provide for you all? That if you would treat him as  you should, we would be lifted out of this, and could get away from  this rock-ribbed island on to some land with soil on? Our future would  be secure. Can't you see it, girl? O, you little fool, for running away  from such a man. Don't you know he owns us all, as it were?\"    \"No, father, he does not.\"    \"The very bread you eat and the water you drink come from his  possessions.\"    \"Still, he does not own us all. He does not own me, nor shall he as long  as I feel as I do now, and as long as there is other land and other  water and other air to which he can lay no claim.\"    It was a bold speech, but something prompted her to say it. She was  aroused. The mother came to intercede, for she knew both father and  daughter well.    \"I tell you, girl, there shall be no more foolishness. You shall do as I  want you, do you hear!\"    Signe arose to go, but her father caught her forcibly by the arm.    \"Sit down and listen to me,\" he said.    The girl began to cry, and the mother interposed: \"Never mind, father;  you know it's useless to talk to her now. Let her go and milk the cow.  It's getting late.\"    So Signe escaped with her pail into the little stable where the cow had  been awaiting her for over an hour. But she was a long time milking,  that evening.          VI.      \"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy    father's house, into a land that I will show thee.\"--_Gen. 12:1_.      Signe Dahl sat in the little coupe of the railroad train which was  carrying her to Christiania. She was the sole occupant of the  compartment, her big valise resting on the opposite seat. Out through  the lowered window she looked at the flying landscape, a mingling of  pine hills, waters, and green meadows. An hour ago she had boarded the  train at Holmen, the nearest station to Nordal. Early that morning she  had tearfully kissed them all good-by and had begun her journey to that  haven of rest from old country oppressions--America. She and her mother  had planned it, and the father had at last given his consent. It was all  the outcome of Hr. Bogstad's persistent devotions to the family on the  island in the lake.    Tiring of the scenery, Signe took from a bundle a letter. It had been  handed her by the postmaster at Nordal that morning as she drove past,  and was from Hr. Bogstad, who was in the North with a party of tourists.  She opened it and read:    \"I wrote you a letter about a week ago, describing our trip up to that  time. I hope you have received it. You know I have no eye for the  beautiful, but I did the best I could. You should have been along and  seen it all yourself.    \"And now I write you again, because, dear friend, I have heard a rumor  from home that you are going to America. It is news to me if it is true.  Dear Signe, don't. Wait, at least, until I can see you again, because I  have something to tell you whether you go or stay. I am coming home as  fast as steam can carry me. Please, don't run off like that. Why should  you? I ask myself. But there, it's only rumor. You're not going, and  I'll see you again in a few days, when I shall tell you all about the  rest of the trip.\"    A smile played on Signe's face, but it soon changed to a more sober  expression. What was she to cause such a commotion in the life of a man  like Hr. Bogstad? That he was in earnest she knew. And here she was  running away from him. He would never see her again. How disappointed he  would be! She could see him driving from the station, alighting at the  ferry, springing into a boat, and skimming over to the island. Up the  steep bank he climbs, and little Hakon runs down to meet him, for which  he receives his usual bag of candy. Perhaps he gets to the house before  he finds out. Then--?    Surely the smile has changed to a tear, for Signe has wiped one away  from her cheek.    To Signe, the journey that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#9)"],[1,"Franklin, expressing himself plainly on that  point, and the American commissioner, after several months' delay, had a  ship of 40 guns placed under the command of Jones. Her original name was  the _Duras_, but at Jones's request it was changed to the _Bonhomme  Richard_. This was in compliment to Franklin, who was often called \"Poor  Richard\" by his admiring countrymen, because for many years he had  published \"Poor Richard's Almanac,\" filled with wise and witty sayings.    This ship was an old Indiaman, in which 42 guns were placed, and the  final number of her crew was 304. The 32-gun frigate _Alliance_, Captain  Landais, was put under the orders of Captain Jones and a third, the  _Pallas_, was bought and armed with thirty guns. A merchant brig and a  cutter were also added to the squadron. It was found very hard to man  these vessels and any other captain than Jones would have given up the  task as an impossible one. It seemed as if about every known nation in  the world was represented and some of the men of the most desperate  character. Maclay says in his \"History of the American Navy\" that the  muster roll of the _Bonhomme Richard_ showed that the men hailed from  America, France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland,  England, Spain, India, Norway, Portugal, Fayal and Malasia, while there  were seven Maltese and the knight of the ship's galley was from Africa.  The majority of the officers, however, were American.    [Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.]    This squadron sailed from L'Orient on June 19, 1779. Almost immediately  trouble occurred. Captain Landais, without any show of reason, claimed  that the command, by right of seniority of commission, belonged to him.  On the first night out the _Alliance_ and _Bonhomme Richard_ collided  and were obliged to return to port for repairs. Vexatious delays  prevented the sailing of the squadron until August 14.    One of the consorts captured an English war vessel in the latter part of  June, but was compelled to abandon her on the appearance of a superior  force of the enemy, and the squadron put into L'Orient for repairs. A  piece of good fortune came to the _Bonhomme Richard_ while in this port.  About a hundred exchanged American prisoners volunteered and did a great  deal to improve the discipline and strengthen the crew of Jones's ship.    The valiant American, however, met with difficulties that were of the  most exasperating nature. A boat's crew deserted and spread the news of  the arrival of the squadron off the English coast. Captain Landais,  commander of the _Alliance_, refused to obey the signals of the  flagship, and conducted himself so outrageously that Jones more than  suspected his brain was askew. The _Bonhomme Richard_ was old and in bad  condition, but Jones told Benjamin Franklin in a letter that he meant to  do something with her that would induce his Government to provide him  with a better ship. He sailed almost completely around Great Britain,  during which he captured seventeen vessels, most of which were  destroyed though the more valuable were sent into port in charge of  prize crews.    This depletion of his crew so weakened it that Captain Jones wisely  refrained from remaining long in one place. Doubling Flamborough Head,  he came up with his companions, the _Pallas_ and the _Alliance_, the  latter having been out of his company for a fortnight.    This was on September 23, 1779. It was near noon, while the American  squadron was chasing a British brigantine and was approaching  Flamborough Head from the south, that a large sail was discovered,  rounding that promontory from the south. Another and another followed,  the astonished Americans counting them until the number had mounted up  to forty-two.    It was a startling sight, for if these vessels were ships of war nothing  could save the American squadron, or, if most of them were merchantmen,  under a strong escort, the peril of Captain Jones and his crews would be  almost as great. The commander studied the fleet through his glass,  allowing it to come closer and closer and holding himself ready to flee,  should it be necessary to do so. Finally, after a long scrutiny, Jones's  face lit up with exultation. There were only two vessels of war in the  fleet, and he immediately gave the signal for pursuit.    The _Serapis_, commanded by Captain Pearson, knew that he was confronted  by the redoubtable Paul Jones, and he welcomed a fight with him, for the  British captain was one of the bravest of men. He signalled for the  merchantmen to scatter, and they did so with the utmost haste, while the  frigate with her consort, the _Countess of Scarborough_, boldly advanced  to engage the American squadron.    It was at this critical moment that the captain of the _Alliance_ once  more showed his insubordination. He refused to obey Jones's signal to  fall to the rear of the _Bonhomme Richard_ and the _Pallas_ for a time  was equally disobedient. Soon, however, she changed her conduct and  gallantly advanced to engage the _Countess of Scarborough_. Captain  Landais, however, sullenly kept out of the battle, and, as we shall  presently learn, did even worse than that.    Captain Pearson, of the _Serapis_, waited until his convoy was beyond  danger, when he tacked inshore. Fearing he would get away, Jones ran in  between him and the land. It was now growing dark, and it was hard for  the American commander to follow the movements of his enemy. But the  latter was not fleeing, and, although dimly visible to each other, the  two antagonists began cautiously approaching, both on the alert for any  advantage that might present itself. Nothing but the rippling of water  made by the vessels broke the profound, expectant hush that rested upon  both.    Suddenly from the gloom came the voice of the captain of the _Serapis_:    \"What ship is that?\"    Jones wished to get nearer before opening fire and replied:    \"I do not understand you; speak louder.\"    \"What ship is that?\" repeated the other in a louder voice through his  trumpet. \"Answer or I shall fire into you.\"    Jones made no reply, knowing that it was useless, but continued to edge  near his antagonist. A minute later both ships discharged a broadside at  the same moment, the gloom being lit up by spouts of crimson flame,  while the thunder \"shook the mighty deep\" and the sulphurous smoke  rolled slowly upward and drifted through the rigging. Then again came a  minute or so of impressive stillness, while the crews of both looked  around to learn the results of the awful tempest of round shot, grape  and canister of which they had been the targets.    Sad work, indeed, had been done, for from each vessel rose the cries of  the wounded and dying--cries that inspired their companions to revenge  and caused them to hasten the reloading and firing of the cannon. But  unfortunately the _Bonhomme Richard_ suffered from her own guns as well  as from those of the enemy. On the lower gun deck was an improvised  battery of six 18-pounders, two of which burst, killing most of the men  at work there and tearing away the deck above them. The remainder of the  men refused to serve the other guns, and thus the _Bonhomme Richard_ was  deprived of the services of her heaviest battery, in addition to the  serious loss in dead and wounded.    Captain Jones forged ahead, crossing his enemy's bow, while the latter  came up on his port quarter. They were within a biscuit's toss of each  other, wrapped in dense smoke, lit up by the jets of flame which were  continuous. Mingled with the terrific booming was the spiteful rattle of  musketry from the tops and yells and cries of the wounded. The decks of  the _Bonhomme Richard_ were slippery with blood, which increased until  the men, as they ran to and fro, splashed in it, like children playing  in a mud puddle, and it was the same on the _Serapis_. It found its  outlet through the scuppers and crimsoned the deep blue of the ocean.    [Illustration: FIGHT BETWEEN \"BONHOMME RICHARD\" AND \"SERAPIS.\"]    Some of the shots from the _Serapis_ pierced the _Bonhomme Richard_  under the water line, causing her to leak badly. Deprived of his  18-pound guns by reason of the accident mentioned, Jones was forced to  rely upon his 12-pounders. They were worked for all that was in them,  but the whole fourteen were silenced in little more than half an hour  and seven of the quarter deck and forecastle guns were dismounted. She  was left with three 9-pounders, which, being loaded and aimed under the  eye of Jones himself, did frightful execution on the deck of the enemy.    An hour had passed and the men were fighting furiously, when the full  moon appeared above the horizon and lit up the fearful scene. The  _Serapis_ attempted to cross the bow of the _Bonhomme Richard_, but  miscalculated and the _Bonhomme Richard_ shoved her bowsprit over the  other's stern. In the lull that followed, when each expected his  antagonist to board, Captain Pearson called out:    \"Have you struck?\"    \"Struck!\" shouted back Jones; \"I am just beginning to fight!\"    The _Serapis_ made another effort to get into position to rake the  American, but in the blinding smoke she ran her jibboom afoul of the  starboard mizzen shrouds of the _Bonhomme Richard_. Captain Jones  himself lashed the spar to the rigging, knowing that his only chance was  in fighting at close quarters, but the swaying of the ships broke them  apart. At that instant, however, the spare anchor of the _Serapis_  caught on the American's quarter and held the two vessels, as may be  said, locked in each other's arms.    They were so close, indeed, that the English gunners could not raise the  lower port lids, and they blew them off by firing their cannon through  them. The men on each ship in loading were forced to push their rammers  into the ports of the other vessel. The _Bonhomme Richard_ was set on  fire by burning wads, but the flames were speedily"]]]
