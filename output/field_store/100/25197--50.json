After this work the stitches on either  line alternately, commencing each one at the point where the last one  ended; this forms on the underside a double row of back stitches. It is  quite easy to work this stitch with the back stitches on the working  side, and when they are required to be on the surface it is advisable to  do it in that way. When embroidering upon a semi-transparent material  this stitch is a satisfactory one to use, the back stitching follows out  the outline on either side of the form, and the crossing of the threads  on the under side shows through prettily. This stitch sometimes goes by  the name of double back stitch. It is useful in many ways, making a  light stitch for stems, leaves, or flowers; it can be sometimes found in  Eastern work used for an entire embroidery. When used for flowers or  leaves the width and the closeness of the stitch are varied to suit the  shape to be filled. An example of its use as a flower filling is shown  in the carnation at fig. 64, which is carried out in four shades of  colour. Considerable use is made of this stitch in embroidered curtain  shown in Plate VII.; it is there employed for all the stems and various  flowers upon the hanging.    [Illustration: Fig. 64.]    [Illustration: Fig. 65.]    The feather stitch, often used to decorate plain needlework, is now to  be discussed; although similar in name it must not be confused with the  feather or plumage stitch that has already been mentioned. The stitch is  so simple and so much in use as hardly to need description; fig. 65  explains the working. There can be many slight variations of the stitch,  the worker perhaps devising them needle in hand. Two are shown in fig.  66. The one to the left is worked very like the ordinary stitch; the  needle picks up the material in a straight line instead of slightly  obliquely, and each stitch touches the one immediately above; it is  here made use of as a couching stitch, a bunch of threads of a  contrasting colour is laid on the material, and the stitch worked over  it from side to side. The right-hand example shows the ordinary feather  stitch worked more closely and in a broader line; carried out in this  way, it can be used for a leaf filling.    [Illustration: Fig. 66.]    Basket stitch, useful for a solid line, shows up very clearly when  worked with a stout twisted thread. This stitch would be appropriately  used when applied to some representation of basket work. To carry out  the diagram (fig. 67)--Trace two parallel lines on the material, and to  commence, bring the thread through on the left-hand line, then insert  the needle on the right-hand line about one-eighth of an inch lower down  and bring it through on the left-hand line exactly opposite (see needle  in fig.); the next stitch is worked by inserting the needle on the  right-hand line but above the last stitch, that is at point A on  diagram, and bringing it through at B. To continue, repeat from the  beginning.    [Illustration: Fig. 67.]    A particularly good line for a border is made by fishbone stitch. It can  be worked in one colour, or as easily in a chequering of two or three,  as shown in the diagram (fig. 68); to carry it out in this way the  worker must have two threads in use, bringing through each as required.  For such purposes as the fillings of small leaves, this stitch is very  useful (see fig. 58). The meeting of the stitches in the centre suggest  the veining line, also the change in direction of the thread gives, to  the two sides of the leaf, pleasant variation in tone. To work  it--Trace three parallel lines upon the material and bring the thread  through on the upper line at the left-hand end. Insert the needle and  bring it through as in process in the diagram, then repeat the same  stitch on the other side the reverse way, that is, insert the needle  just over the central line and bring it through on the upper one close  to the last stitch. Care must be taken that the stitches cross well over  each other at the centre, or the material will show through.    [Illustration: Fig. 68.]    [Illustration: Fig. 69.]    The stitch shown in fig. 69, known as plait or Cretan, is commonly seen  on Cretan and other Eastern embroideries. It can be used as a solid  border stitch or as a filling, varying in width as required. To work  it--Bring the thread through on the lower central line, then insert the  needle on the uppermost line and bring it through on the next below as  in process in the diagram; then, still keeping the thread to the right,  insert the needle immediately underneath on the lowest line and bring it  through on the line next above, in fashion similar to the last stitch,  but in reverse direction. To continue, work the stitch alternately on  one side and the other, always keeping the thread to the right of the  needle. In order to make the central plait broader take up rather less  material with the needle; this will decrease the outer and increase the  inner lines. Fig. 70 is taken from a Cretan embroidery, in which this  stitch is mainly used.    [Illustration: Fig. 70.]    [Illustration: Fig. 71.]    Another similar but more simple stitch, often seen in Eastern work, is  shown in fig. 71. It can also frequently be found employed on XVIIth  century English wool work hangings. It is sometimes called Roumanian  stitch, and is composed of one long stitch crossed by a short one in the  centre. To work it--Trace two parallel lines on the material and bring  the thread through on the left-hand line at the top. Insert the needle  on the opposite line and bring it through near the centre, as shown in  process in the diagram. For the next half of the stitch the needle  enters the material at point A on plan, and is brought through again on  the left-hand line close to the last stitch, and so in position to  commence again. An illustration of this stitch in use as a filling can  be seen at fig. 72. It is worked in four shades of green wool, and each  line of stitches is so arranged as to encroach slightly on the line  before by means of setting each stitch just between two of the last row.  This method of working has two advantages; the shading is thus made  more gradual, and a pleasant undulating effect is given to the surface  of the leaf. This can be most easily understood by a practical trial of  the stitch and method.    [Illustration: Fig. 72.]      INSERTION STITCHES    There is occasion sometimes in embroidery to join edges together  visibly. This gives an opportunity for some additional pretty  stitching--the addition of something like this, that is perhaps not  absolutely necessary, has extra value from the evidence it gives of the  worker's interest and delight in her work, a quality always appreciated;  on the other hand, work done from the motive of getting a result with as  little labour as possible is valued at just its worth.    These insertion stitches are useful for joining together edges of  cushion covers, bags, detached bands, also for the ornamentation of  dress, and for embroideries upon which drawn thread work is not  possible. A stout thread is usually suitable for the purpose. The raw  edges must first be turned in and flattened, and the parts to be joined  can if necessary be tacked in place on a temporary ground such as  _toile ciree_.    Fig. 73 illustrates a twisted insertion stitch that is quickly executed  and very frequently used. The diagram sufficiently explains the working  without further description.    [Illustration: Fig. 73.]    Buttonhole stitch can be turned to account for this purpose. Fig. 74  shows the tailor's buttonhole used as an insertion stitch; for this  purpose it is the better of the two kinds of buttonhole. The stitches  could be arranged in various ways; in the present example three are  worked closely together on either side in turn. The only difficulty with  this buttonhole insertion is that on one side the stitch has to be  worked in direction contrary to that usual, that is from right to left  instead of from left to right. In the diagram the needle is shown  working in this reverse way.    [Illustration: Fig. 74.]    [Illustration: Fig. 75.]    Fig. 75 is a knotted insertion stitch; the knot at each side makes the  stitch a very rigid one. To work it--Bring the thread through at the  lower left-hand side, insert the needle on the upper side a little  towards the right, draw the thread through, and then tie the knot on it  as in process in the diagram.    [Illustration: Fig. 76.]    A rather more complicated joining stitch is shown in fig. 76. It could  be carried out with different coloured threads. The two sides must be  first worked with the edging, which is practically the braid stitch  described on page 88. Commence the stitch in exactly the same way as  when carrying out braid stitch, but work on the edge of the material as  in buttonholing, the working edge in this case being away from the  worker. Let the worker, having reached the point of pulling the thread  through to complete the stitch, draw it out in the direction away from  her. This will draw the stitch towards the edge, where it will form a  knot. In the diagram one of the stitches has been partly undone in order  to show the working more clearly. When the two sides are bound with the  stitch, they can be laced together with another thread as in the  illustration.      PICOTS    Picots are commonly in use in lace work and they are sometimes required  for embroidery purposes, especially in the kinds of work nearly allied  to lace, such as cut work, or for an added ornament to an edging stitch.    [Illustration: Fig. 77.]    Fig. 77 shows too small picots added to a buttonhole bar, and on the  lower bar is shown the method of working the left-hand picot.

Mr. Cattell's comment upon what he heard of  the story took the form of a quotation from Shakespeare. You may guess  it without difficulty. It began with the words \"There are more  things.\"          AN EPISODE OF CATHEDRAL HISTORY          AN EPISODE OF CATHEDRAL HISTORY      There was once a learned gentleman who was deputed to examine and  report upon the archives of the Cathedral of Southminster. The  examination of these records demanded a very considerable expenditure  of time: hence it became advisable for him to engage lodgings in the  city: for though the Cathedral body were profuse in their offers of  hospitality, Mr. Lake felt that he would prefer to be master of his  day. This was recognized as reasonable. The Dean eventually wrote  advising Mr. Lake, if he were not already suited, to communicate with  Mr. Worby, the principal Verger, who occupied a house convenient to  the church and was prepared to take in a quiet lodger for three or  four weeks. Such an arrangement was precisely what Mr. Lake desired.  Terms were easily agreed upon, and early in December, like another Mr.  Datchery (as he remarked to himself), the investigator found himself  in the occupation of a very comfortable room in an ancient and  \"cathedraly\" house.    One so familiar with the customs of Cathedral churches, and treated  with such obvious consideration by the Dean and Chapter of this  Cathedral in particular, could not fail to command the respect of the  Head Verger. Mr. Worby even acquiesced in certain modifications of  statements he had been accustomed to offer for years to parties of  visitors. Mr. Lake, on his part, found the Verger a very cheery  companion, and took advantage of any occasion that presented itself  for enjoying his conversation when the day's work was over.    One evening, about nine o'clock, Mr. Worby knocked at his lodger's  door. \"I've occasion,\" he said, \"to go across to the Cathedral, Mr.  Lake, and I think I made you a promise when I did so next I would give  you the opportunity to see what it looks like at night time. It is  quite fine and dry outside, if you care to come.\"    \"To be sure I will; very much obliged to you, Mr. Worby, for thinking  of it, but let me get my coat.\"    \"Here it is, sir, and I've another lantern here that you'll find  advisable for the steps, as there's no moon.\"    \"Any one might think we were Jasper and Durdles, over again, mightn't  they,\" said Lake, as they crossed the close, for he had ascertained  that the Verger had read _Edwin Drood_.    \"Well, so they might,\" said Mr. Worby, with a short laugh, \"though I  don't know whether we ought to take it as a compliment. Odd ways, I  often think, they had at that Cathedral, don't it seem so to you, sir?  Full choral matins at seven o'clock in the morning all the year round.  Wouldn't suit our boys' voices nowadays, and I think there's one or  two of the men would be applying for a rise if the Chapter was to  bring it in--particular the alltoes.\"    They were now at the south-west door. As Mr. Worby was unlocking it,  Lake said, \"Did you ever find anybody locked in here by accident?\"    \"Twice I did. One was a drunk sailor; however he got in I don't know.  I s'pose he went to sleep in the service, but by the time I got to him  he was praying fit to bring the roof in. Lor'! what a noise that man  did make! said it was the first time he'd been inside a church for ten  years, and blest if ever he'd try it again. The other was an old  sheep: them boys it was, up to their games. That was the last time  they tried it on, though. There, sir, now you see what we look like;  our late Dean used now and again to bring parties in, but he preferred  a moonlight night, and there was a piece of verse he'd coat to 'em,  relating to a Scotch cathedral, I understand; but I don't know; I  almost think the effect's better when it's all dark-like. Seems to add  to the size and heighth. Now if you won't mind stopping somewhere in  the nave while I go up into the choir where my business lays, you'll  see what I mean.\"    Accordingly Lake waited, leaning against a pillar, and watched the  light wavering along the length of the church, and up the steps into  the choir, until it was intercepted by some screen or other furniture,  which only allowed the reflection to be seen on the piers and roof.  Not many minutes had passed before Worby reappeared at the door of the  choir and by waving his lantern signalled to Lake to rejoin him.    \"I suppose it _is_ Worby, and not a substitute,\" thought Lake to  himself, as he walked up the nave. There was, in fact, nothing  untoward. Worby showed him the papers which he had come to fetch out  of the Dean's stall, and asked him what he thought of the spectacle:  Lake agreed that it was well worth seeing. \"I suppose,\" he said, as  they walked towards the altar-steps together, \"that you're too much  used to going about here at night to feel nervous--but you must get a  start every now and then, don't you, when a book falls down or a door  swings to.\"    \"No, Mr. Lake, I can't say I think much about noises, not nowadays:  I'm much more afraid of finding an escape of gas or a burst in the  stove pipes than anything else. Still there have been times, years  ago. Did you notice that plain altar-tomb there--fifteenth century we  say it is, I don't know if you agree to that? Well, if you didn't look  at it, just come back and give it a glance, if you'd be so good.\" It  was on the north side of the choir, and rather awkwardly placed: only  about three feet from the enclosing stone screen. Quite plain, as the  Verger had said, but for some ordinary stone panelling. A metal cross  of some size on the northern side (that next to the screen) was the  solitary feature of any interest.    Lake agreed that it was not earlier than the Perpendicular period:  \"but,\" he said, \"unless it's the tomb of some remarkable person,  you'll forgive me for saying that I don't think it's particularly  noteworthy.\"    \"Well, I can't say as it is the tomb of anybody noted in 'istory,\"  said Worby, who had a dry smile on his face, \"for we don't own any  record whatsoever of who it was put up to. For all that, if you've  half an hour to spare, sir, when we get back to the house, Mr. Lake, I  could tell you a tale about that tomb. I won't begin on it now; it  strikes cold here, and we don't want to be dawdling about all night.\"    \"Of course I should like to hear it immensely.\"    \"Very well, sir, you shall. Now if I might put a question to you,\" he  went on, as they passed down the choir aisle, \"in our little local  guide--and not only there, but in the little book on our Cathedral in  the series--you'll find it stated that this portion of the building  was erected previous to the twelfth century. Now of course I should be  glad enough to take that view, but--mind the step, sir--but, I put it  to you--does the lay of the stone 'ere in this portion of the wall  (which he tapped with his key) does it to your eye carry the flavour  of what you might call Saxon masonry? No, I thought not; no more it  does to me: now, if you'll believe me, I've said as much to those  men--one's the librarian of our Free Libry here, and the other came  down from London on purpose--fifty times, if I have once, but I might  just as well have talked to that bit of stonework. But there it is, I  suppose every one's got their opinions.\"    The discussion of this peculiar trait of human nature occupied Mr.  Worby almost up to the moment when he and Lake re-entered the former's  house. The condition of the fire in Lake's sitting-room led to a  suggestion from Mr. Worby that they should finish the evening in his  own parlour. We find them accordingly settled there some short time  afterwards.    Mr. Worby made his story a long one, and I will not undertake to tell  it wholly in his own words, or in his own order. Lake committed the  substance of it to paper immediately after hearing it, together with  some few passages of the narrative which had fixed themselves  _verbatim_ in his mind; I shall probably find it expedient to condense  Lake's record to some extent.    Mr. Worby was born, it appeared, about the year 1828. His father  before him had been connected with the Cathedral, and likewise his  grandfather. One or both had been choristers, and in later life both  had done work as mason and carpenter respectively about the fabric.  Worby himself, though possessed, as he frankly acknowledged, of an  indifferent voice, had been drafted into the choir at about ten years  of age.    It was in 1840 that the wave of the Gothic revival smote the Cathedral  of Southminster. \"There was a lot of lovely stuff went then, sir,\"  said Worby, with a sigh. \"My father couldn't hardly believe it when he  got his orders to clear out the choir. There was a new dean just come  in--Dean Burscough it was--and my father had been 'prenticed to a good  firm of joiners in the city, and knew what good work was when he saw  it. Crool it was, he used to say: all that beautiful wainscot oak, as  good as the day it was put up, and garlands-like of foliage and fruit,  and lovely old gilding work on the coats of arms and the organ pipes.  All went to the timber yard--every bit except some little pieces  worked up in the Lady Chapel, and 'ere in this overmantel. Well--I may  be mistook, but I say our choir never looked as well since. Still  there was a lot found out about the history of the church, and no "]]]
