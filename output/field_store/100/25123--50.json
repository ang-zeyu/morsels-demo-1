This is what Professor  Huxley and others call \"the creative idea,\" to which the widespread  influence of his writings is to be referred.    FOOTNOTES:    [12] _Origin of Species_, p. 517.    [13] _The Variations of Animals and Plants under Domestication._ By  Charles Darwin, F. R. S., etc. New York, 1868, vol. ii. pp. 515, 516.    [14] What can the word \"imagination\" mean in this sentence, if it does  not mean \"Common Sense?\"    [15] Mr. Darwin's habit of personifying nature has given, as his friend  Mr. Wallace says, his readers a good deal of trouble. He defines nature  to be the aggregate of physical forces; and in the single passage  quoted, he speaks of Natural Selection \"as intently watching\" \"picking  out with unerring skill,\" and \"carefully preserving.\" It is true, he  tells us this is all to be understood metaphorically.      _Testimony of the Advocates of the Theory._    It is time to turn to the exposition of Darwinism by its avowed  advocates, in proof of the assertion that it excludes all teleology.    The first of these witnesses is Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, himself a  distinguished naturalist. Mr. Darwin informs his readers that as early  as 1844, he had collected his material and worked out his theory, but  had not published it to the world, although it had been communicated to  some of his friends. In 1858 he received a memoir from Mr. Wallace, who  was then studying the natural history of the Malay Archipelago. From  that memoir he learnt that Mr. Wallace had \"arrived at almost exactly  the same conclusions as I (he himself) have on the origin of species.\"  This led to the publishing his book on that subject contemporaneously  with Mr. Wallace's memoir. There has been no jealousy or rivalry between  these gentlemen. Mr. Wallace gracefully acknowledges the priority of Mr.  Darwin's claim, and attributes to him the credit of having elaborated  and sustained it in a way to secure for it universal attention. These  facts are mentioned in order to show the competency of Mr. Wallace as a  witness as to the true character of Darwinism.    Mr. Wallace, in \"The Theory of Natural Selection,\" devotes a chapter to  the consideration of the objections urged by the Duke of Argyll, in his  work on the \"Reign of Law,\" against that theory. Those objections are  principally two: first, that design necessarily implies an intelligent  designer; and second, that beauty not being an advantage to its  possessor in the struggle for life, cannot be accounted for on the  principle of the survival of the fittest. The Duke, he says, maintains  that contrivance and beauty indicate \"the constant supervision and  interference of the Creator, and cannot possibly be explained by the  unassisted action of any combination of laws. Now, Mr. Darwin's work,\"  he adds, \"has for its main object to show that all the phenomena of  living things--all their wonderful organs and complicated structures,  their infinite variety of form, size, and color, their intricate and  involved relations to each other--may have been produced by the action  of a few general laws of the simplest kind, laws which are in most cases  mere statements of admitted facts.\" (p. 265) Those laws are those with  which we are familiar: Heredity, Variations, Over Production, Struggle  for Life, Survival of the Fittest. \"It is probable,\" he says, \"that  these primary facts or laws are but results of the very nature of life,  and of the essential properties of organized and unorganized matter. Mr.  Herbert Spencer, in his 'First Principles' and in his 'Biology,' has, I  think, made us able to understand how this may be; but at present we  may accept these simple laws, without going further back, and the  question then is, Whether the variety, the harmony, the contrivance, and  the beauty we perceive, can have been produced by the action of these  laws alone, or whether we are required to believe in the incessant  interference and direct action of the mind and will of the Creator.\" (p.  267)[16] Mr. Wallace says, that the Duke of Argyll maintains that God  \"has personally applied general laws to produce effects which those laws  are not in themselves capable of producing; that the universe alone with  all its laws intact, would be a sort of chaos, without variety, without  harmony, without design, without beauty; that there is not (and  therefore we may presume that there could not be) any self-developing  power in the universe. I believe, on the contrary, that the universe is  so constituted as to be self-regulating; that as long it contains life,  the forms under which that life is manifested have an inherent power of  adjustment to each other and to their surroundings; and that this  adjustment necessarily leads to the greatest amount of variety and  beauty and enjoyment, because it does depend on general laws, and not on  a continual supervision and rearrangement of details.\" (p. 268) \"The  strange springs and traps and pitfalls found in the flowers of Orchids,  cannot,\" he says, \"be necessary _per se_, since exactly the same end is  gained in ten thousand other flowers which do not possess them. Is it  not then an extraordinary idea, to imagine the Creator of the universe  contriving the various complicated parts of these flowers, as a mechanic  might contrive an ingenious toy or a difficult puzzle? Is it not a more  worthy conception, that they are the results of those general laws which  were so cooerdinated at the first introduction of life upon the earth as  to result necessarily in the utmost possible development of varied  forms.\" (p. 270) \"I for one,\" he says, \"cannot believe that the world  would come to chaos if left to law alone.... If any modification of  structure could be the result of law, why not all? If some  self-adaptations should arise, why not others? If any varieties of  color, why not all the varieties we see? No attempt is made to explain  this except by reference to the fact that 'purpose' and 'contrivance'  are everywhere visible, and by an illogical deduction they could only  have arisen by the direct action of some mind, because the direct action  of our minds produce similar 'contrivances;' but it is forgotten that  adaptation, however produced, must have the appearance of design.\" (p.  280)[17] After referring to the fact that florists and breeders can  produce varieties in plants and animals, so that, \"whether they wanted a  bull-dog to torture another animal, a greyhound to catch a hare, or a  bloodhound to hunt down their oppressed fellow-creatures, the required  variations have always appeared,\" he adds: \"To be consistent, our  opponents must maintain that every one of the variations that have  rendered possible the changes produced by man, have been determined at  the right time and place by the Creator. Every race produced by the  florist or breeder, the dog or the pigeon fancier, the rat-catcher, the  sporting man, or the slave-hunter, must have been provided for by  varieties occurring when wanted; and as these variations were never  withheld, it would prove that the sanction of an all-wise and all  powerful Being has been given to that which the highest human minds  consider to be trivial, mean, or debasing.\" (p. 290)[18]    The Nebular Hypothesis, as propounded by La Place, proposed to account  for the origin of the universe, by a process of evolution under the  control of mere physical forces. That hypothesis has, so far as  evolution is concerned, been adopted by men who sincerely believe in God  and in the Bible. But they hold not only that God created matter and  endowed it with its properties, but that He designed the universe, and  so controlled the operation of physical laws that they accomplished his  purpose. So there are Christian men who believe in the evolution of one  kind of plants and animals out of earlier and simpler forms; but they  believe that everything was designed by God, and that it is due to his  purpose and power that all the forms of vegetable and animal life are  what they are. But this is not the question. What Darwin and the  advocates of his theory deny, is all design. The organs, even the most  complicated and wonderful, were not intended. They are said to be due to  the undirected and unintended operation of physical laws. This is Mr.  Wallace's argument. He endeavors to show that it is unworthy of God that  He should be supposed to have contrived the mechanism of the orchids, as  a mechanist contrives a curious puzzle.    We recently heard Prof. Joseph Henry, in a brief address, say  substantially: \"If I take brass, glass, and other materials, and fuse  them, the product is a slag. This is what physical laws do. If I take  those same materials, and form them into a telescope, that is what mind  does.\" This is the whole question in a nutshell. That design implies an  intelligent designer, is a self evident truth. Every man believes it;  and no man can practically disbelieve it. Even those naturalists who  theoretically deny it, if they find in a cave so simple a thing as a  flint arrow-head, are as sure that it was made by a man as they are of  their own existence. And yet they want us to believe that an eagle's eye  is the product of blind natural causes. No combination of physical  forces ever made a ship or a locomotive. It may, indeed, be said that  they are dead matter, whereas plants and animals live. But what is life  but one form of the organizing efficiency of God?    Mr. Wallace does not go as far as Mr. Darwin. He recoils from regarding  man either as to body or soul as the product of mere natural causes. He  insists that \"a superior intelligence is necessary to account for man.\"  (p. 359) This of course implies that the agency of no such higher  intelligence is admitted in the production of plants or of animals lower  than man.

This  monstrous document was sent at the time in printed form, in the French  language, to the editorial office of the Odessa newspaper \"Novorosisk  Telegraph\" for those who might want to examine the accuracy of the  translation published in No. 4996 of that newspaper, dated January 15,  1891, and reprinted in No. 21 of the Petersburg newspaper \"Znamya,\"  dated January 22, 1904. THE SPEECH RELATES TO THE TIME OF THE SANHEDRIN  OF 1869.)]    [Paragraphs which are indented and parts in italics were omitted in the  Butmi version, but are given in the French publication \"Le Peril Judeo  Maconnique--I. Les Protocols des Sages de Zion,\" by Jouin, Paris, 1920.]         \"Our fathers ordained the chosen ones in Israel to gather, without       fail, once every century, at the grave of our great Master Caleb,       the sainted Rabbi Simeon Ben Judah, whose great knowledge is       imparted to the elect of each generation to gain the power over the       whole world and authority over all the descendants of Israel....              \"It is already eighteen centuries that the war of Israel is            being waged with the power which had been promised to Abraham            but which had been snatched away from him by the _Cross_.            Trampled under foot, humiliated by his enemies, ceaselessly            under threats of death, of persecution, of rapine and violence            of every sort, Israel has not succumbed; and if he is            dispersed over the whole world it is because the whole world            should belong to him.         \"It has been for a few [eighteen] centuries now that our learned       men have been fighting against the Cross with courage and       persistence which nothing can break. Our people is rising gradually       and, with each day, its forces are growing. _It is to us that this       God of the day belongs, which was erected by Aaron in the       wilderness, this golden calf, this universal deity of the epoch._         \"When we become, at last, the sole possessors of all the gold to be       found on earth, the true power will practically be transferred to       our hands, and the promises made to Abraham will be fulfilled.       _Gold--is the greatest power on earth; it is might, reward, the       instrument of every authority, it is all man, both fears and       desires. This is the sole mystery, the most profound science of       that spirit with the aid of which the entire world is ruled._ This       is what the future holds in store. Eighteen centuries have belonged       to our enemies; this century and the following must belong to us,       the People of Israel, and will be ours, without fail. Here, for the       tenth time during a thousand years of cruel and incessant struggle       with our enemies, have assembled at this cemetery; at the grave of       the great Master, Caleb, the sainted Rabbi Simeon Ben Judah, the       elect of each of the tribes of the Israelite people, in order to       discuss and agree upon, the means of making use, in the interests       of our cause, of all the tremendous mistakes and errors, which our       enemies--the Christians--have not ceased to commit. Every time the       new Sanhedrin (assembly) proclaimed and preached merciless warfare       against our enemies, but not once during the past centuries did our       forefathers succeed in concentrating in our hands such an enormous       quantity of gold [_and consequently of power_] as the nineteenth       century has given us. We are therefore able, without any senseless       illusions, to flatter ourselves with the hope of attaining our goal       before long, and we can look forward with assurance into the very       eyes of the future.         \"Persecutions and insults,--these sombre and tortuous times, which       the people of Israel bore with heroic patience,--have fortunately       come to an end, owing to the progress of civilization among the       Christians, and this progress is the best shield under which we can       hide and scheme, in order that we may cover quickly and decisively       the last leg of that distance which divides us from our supreme       aim. Let us cast a cursory glance at the economic situation of       Europe and analyze the resources which fell to the Israelites from       the beginning of the present century, owing to the concentration in       their hands of the tremendous capital which is in their possession       at the present time. It turns out that in Paris, London, Vienna,       Berlin, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Naples, etc. [_and in all       lands--the Rothschilds_], that everywhere, the Israelites are the       masters of the financial situation, being as they are possessors of       many billions, not to mention localities of the second and third       class where all the financial funds are in their hands and not       mentioning that, without their direct influence, no financial       operation, no work of any importance, could be carried out anywhere       at any time. At present, all the emperors, kings and ruling princes       are burdened with tremendous debts incurred in order to be able to       maintain numerous standing armies [_to sustain their tottering       thrones_]. The Bourse quotes and regulates these moneys, and we are       the full masters of the Bourse in all the centres of the globe. The       problem before us now is to facilitate even to a greater extent the       means of contracting these loans and thus to become the sole       managers of all valuables, after which the exploitation of all       their railroads, mines, forests, large factories and industrial       plants, as well as of all other (real property) including duties       and taxes, will fall into our hands, as a security for the capital       lent by us to the various States.         \"Agriculture will forever remain the principal source of a       country's wealth. The possession of large plots of land will pave       for us even a broader way to honors and will strengthen our       influence (over the highest officials of the country). From this       follows, that our efforts will be directed towards inducing our       brethren in Israel to make large agricultural purchases. We must,       therefore, do our utmost to break up large estates into small       parcels, in order to be able to purchase them in the easiest and       quickest way. Under the pretext of trying to help the working       classes, it is necessary to oppress the large landowners with       taxation in all its severity. When these possessions will thus       gradually be transferred into our hands, the whole labor of the       Christian proletariat will become for us a new source of tremendous       profits. _Since the Christian Church is one of our most dangerous       enemies, we must work tirelessly to weaken its influence, and in       order to accomplish this, it is necessary to use all our efforts to       implant in the Christian intellectual class ideas of atheism,       scepticism, dissension and to call forth religious disputes among       the newly-formed groups and sects of Christendom._              \"Logically, we must begin by depreciating the ministers of            this religion. Let us declare open war on them, let us provoke            suspicions on their devotion, on their private conduct, and by            ridicule and persiflage we shall be right in the consideration            attached to the state and the costume of the priest.         \"Every war, every revolution, every political and religious       upheaval brings nearer the moment when we shall attain the great       end for which we have been striving so long. Commerce and       speculation--these branches, most plentiful in their fruits,--must       never be suffered to slip out of the hands of the Israelites.              \"... and once these branches have become identified with us,            we shall, through the flattery and perspicacity of our            executives, know how to penetrate to the prime source of true            influence and power. It is understood that we are concerned            only with those pursuits that entail honors, power or            privileges, for all those that require knowledge, labor or            disagreeable conditions, these can and should be left to the            Christians. The magistrature is an institution of prime            importance for us. The legal profession develops most the            faculty of civilization and initiates one furthest in the            affairs of our natural enemies, the Christians, and it is            through it that we can subject them to our mercy. Why should            not the Jews become Ministers of Instruction when they have so            often been Ministers of Finance? The Jews must also aspire to            the rank of legislators with the object of abrogating the laws            made by the Goim, faithless sinners, against the sons of            Israel, the true believers, in their invariable attachment to            the holy laws of Abraham.              \"Moreover, on this point, our plan is nearing the most            complete realization, for progress has nearly everywhere            recognized and accorded to us the same civic rights as to            Christians, but that which it is of importance to obtain, that            which must be the object of our ceaseless efforts, is a law            less severe on bankruptcy. We shall make of it a gold mine            more rich than were ever the mines of California.              \"With this object in view the people of Israel must direct its            ambition towards those high offices of authority which have            the power to distribute honors and esteem. The most assured            way of attaining such offices is to have weight and importance  "]]]
