Beggars swarmed among  the bidden guests, sure of an easy harvest where so many hearts were  melted by piety. The wedding jester excelled himself in apt allusions  to the friends and relatives who brought up their wedding presents at  his merry invitation. The sixteen-year-old bride, suffocated beneath  her heavy veil, blushed unseen at the numerous healths drunk to her  future sons and daughters. The whole town was a-flutter with joy,  because the pious scion of a godly race had found a pious wife, and a  young branch of the tree of Judah was about to bear fruit.    When I came to lie on my mother's breast, she sang me lullabies on  lofty themes. I heard the names of Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah as early  as the names of father, mother, and nurse. My baby soul was enthralled  by sad and noble cadences, as my mother sang of my ancient home in  Palestine, or mourned over the desolation of Zion. With the first  rattle that was placed in my hand a prayer was pronounced over me, a  petition that a pious man might take me to wife, and a messiah be  among my sons.    I was fed on dreams, instructed by means of prophecies, trained to  hear and see mystical things that callous senses could not perceive. I  was taught to call myself a princess, in memory of my forefathers who  had ruled a nation. Though I went in the disguise of an outcast, I  felt a halo resting on my brow. Sat upon by brutal enemies, unjustly  hated, annihilated a hundred times, I yet arose and held my head high,  sure that I should find my kingdom in the end, although I had lost my  way in exile; for He who had brought my ancestors safe through a  thousand perils was guiding my feet as well. God needed me and I  needed Him, for we two together had a work to do, according to an  ancient covenant between Him and my forefathers.    This is the dream to which I was heir, in common with every sad-eyed  child of the Pale. This is the living seed which I found among my  heirlooms, when I learned how to strip from them the prickly husk in  which they were passed down to me. And what is the fruit of such seed  as that, and whither lead such dreams? If it is mine to give the  answer, let my words be true and brave.          CHAPTER III    BOTH THEIR HOUSES      Among the mediaeval customs which were preserved in the Pale when the  rest of the world had long forgotten them was the use of popular  sobriquets in place of surnames proper. Family names existed only in  official documents, such as passports. For the most part people were  known by nicknames, prosaic or picturesque, derived from their  occupations, their physical peculiarities, or distinctive  achievements. Among my neighbors in Polotzk were Yankel the Wig-maker,  Mulye the Blind, Moshe the Six-fingered; and members of their  respective families were referred to by these nicknames: as, for  example, \"Mirele, niece of Moshe the Six-fingered.\"    Let me spread out my family tree, raise aloft my coat-of-arms, and see  what heroes have left a mark by which I may be distinguished. Let me  hunt for my name in the chronicles of the Pale.    In the village of Yuchovitch, about sixty versts above Polotzk, the  oldest inhabitant still remembered my father's great-grandfather when  my father was a boy. Lebe the Innkeeper he was called, and no reproach  was coupled with the name. His son Hayyim succeeded to the business,  but later he took up the glazier's trade, and developed a knack for  all sorts of tinkering, whereby he was able to increase his too scanty  earnings.    Hayyim the Glazier is reputed to have been a man of fine countenance,  wise in homely counsel, honest in all his dealings. Rachel Leah, his  wife, had a reputation for practical wisdom even greater than his. She  was the advice giver of the village in every perplexity of life. My  father remembers his grandmother as a tall, trim, handsome old woman,  active and independent. Satin headbands and lace-trimmed bonnets not  having been invented in her day, Rachel Leah wore the stately knupf or  turban on her shaven head. On Sabbaths and holidays she went to the  synagogue with a long, straight mantle hanging from neck to ankle; and  she wore it with an air, on one sleeve only, the other dangling empty  from her shoulder.    Hayyim begat Joseph, and Joseph begat Pinchus, my father. It behooves  me to consider the stuff I sprang from.    Joseph inherited the trade, good name, and meagre portion of his  father, and maintained the family tradition of honesty and poverty  unbroken to the day of his death. For that matter, Yuchovitch never  heard of any connection of the family, not even a doubtful cousin, who  was not steeped to the earlocks in poverty. But that was no  distinction in Yuchovitch; the whole village was poor almost to  beggary.    Joseph was an indifferent workman, an indifferent scholar, and an  indifferent hasid. At one thing only he was strikingly good, and that  was at grumbling. Although not unkind, he had a temper that boiled  over at small provocation, and even in his most placid mood he took  very little satisfaction in the world. He reversed the proverb,  looking for the sable lining of every silver cloud. In the conditions  of his life he found plenty of food for his pessimism, and merry  hearts were very rare among his neighbors. Still a certain amount of  gloom appears to have been inherent in the man. And as he distrusted  the whole world, so Joseph distrusted himself, which made him shy and  awkward in company. My mother tells how, at the wedding of his only  son, my father, Joseph sat the whole night through in a corner, never  as much as cracking a smile, while the wedding guests danced, laughed,  and rejoiced.    It may have been through distrust of the marital state that Joseph  remained single till the advanced age of twenty-five. Then he took  unto himself an orphan girl as poor as he, namely, Rachel, the  daughter of Israel Kimanyer of pious memory.    My grandmother was such a gentle, cheerful soul, when I knew her, that  I imagine she must have been a merry bride. I should think my  grandfather would have taken great satisfaction in her society, as her  attempts to show him the world through rose-hued spectacles would have  given him frequent opportunity to parade his grievances and recite his  wrongs. But from all reports it appears that he was never satisfied,  and if he did not make his wife unhappy it was because he was away  from home so much. He was absent the greater part of the time; for a  glazier, even if he were a better workman than my grandfather, could  not make a living in Yuchovitch. He became a country peddler, trading  between Polotzk and Yuchovitch, and taking in all the desolate little  hamlets scattered along that route. Fifteen rubles' worth of goods was  a big bill to carry out of Polotzk. The stock consisted of cheap  pottery, tobacco, matches, boot grease, and axle grease. These he  bartered for country produce, including grains in small quantity,  bristles, rags, and bones. Money was seldom handled in these  transactions.    A rough enough life my grandfather led, on the road at all seasons, in  all weathers, knocking about at smoky little inns, glad sometimes of  the hospitality of some peasant's hut, where the pigs slept with the  family. He was doing well if he got home for the holidays with a  little white flour for a cake, and money enough to take his best coat  out of pawn. The best coat, and the candlesticks, too, would be  repawned promptly on the first workday; for it was not for the like of  Joseph of Yuchovitch to live with idle riches around him.    For the credit of Yuchovitch it must be recorded that my grandfather  never had to stay away from the synagogue for want of his one decent  coat to wear. His neighbor Isaac, the village money lender, never  refused to give up the pledged articles on a Sabbath eve, even if the  money due was not forthcoming. Many Sabbath coats besides my  grandfather's, and many candlesticks besides my grandmother's, passed  most of their existence under Isaac's roof, waiting to be redeemed.  But on the eve of Sabbath or holiday Isaac delivered them to their  respective owners, came they empty-handed or otherwise; and at the  expiration of the festival the grateful owners brought them promptly  back, for another season of retirement.    While my grandfather was on the road, my grandmother conducted her  humble household in a capable, housewifely way. Of her six children,  three died young, leaving two daughters and an only son, my father. My  grandmother fed and dressed her children the best she could, and  taught them to thank God for what they had not as well as for what  they had. Piety was about the only positive doctrine she attempted to  drill them in, leaving the rest of their education to life and the  rebbe.    Promptly when custom prescribed, Pinchus, the petted only son, was  sent to heder. My grandfather being on the road at the time, my  grandmother herself carried the boy in her arms, as was usual on the  first day. My father distinctly remembers that she wept on the way to  the heder; partly, I suppose, from joy at starting her son on a holy  life, and partly from sadness at being too poor to set forth the wine  and honey-cake proper to the occasion. For Grandma Rachel, schooled  though she was to pious contentment, probably had her moments of human  pettiness like the rest of us.    My father distinguished himself for scholarship from the first. Five  years old when he entered heder, at eleven he was already a _yeshibah  bahur_--a student in the seminary. The rebbe never had occasion to use  the birch on him. On the contrary, he held him up as an example to the  dull or lazy pupils, praised him in the village, and carried his fame  to Polotzk.    My grandmother's cup of pious joy was overfilled.

It is a proverb that the first French kings were  puppets; that the mayor of the palace was quite insolently the king of  the king. Yet it is certain that the puppet became an idol; a popular  idol of unparalleled power, before which all mayors and nobles bent or  were broken. In France arose absolute government, the more because it  was not precisely personal government. The King was already a  thing--like the Republic. Indeed the mediaeval Republics were rigid with  divine right. In Norman England, perhaps, the government was too  personal to be absolute. Anyhow, there is a real though recondite sense  in which William the Conqueror was William the Conquered. When his two  sons were dead, the whole country fell into a feudal chaos almost like  that before the Conquest. In France the princes who had been slaves  became something exceptional like priests; and one of them became a  saint. But somehow our greatest kings were still barons; and by that  very energy our barons became our kings.          VI    THE AGE OF THE CRUSADES      The last chapter began, in an apparent irrelevance, with the name of St.  Edward; and this one might very well begin with the name of St. George.  His first appearance, it is said, as a patron of our people, occurred at  the instance of Richard Coeur de Lion during his campaign in  Palestine; and this, as we shall see, really stands for a new England  which might well have a new saint. But the Confessor is a character in  English history; whereas St. George, apart from his place in martyrology  as a Roman soldier, can hardly be said to be a character in any history.  And if we wish to understand the noblest and most neglected of human  revolutions, we can hardly get closer to it than by considering this  paradox, of how much progress and enlightenment was represented by thus  passing from a chronicle to a romance.    In any intellectual corner of modernity can be found such a phrase as I  have just read in a newspaper controversy: \"Salvation, like other good  things, must not come from outside.\" To call a spiritual thing external  and not internal is the chief mode of modernist excommunication. But if  our subject of study is mediaeval and not modern, we must pit against  this apparent platitude the very opposite idea. We must put ourselves in  the posture of men who thought that almost every good thing came from  outside--like good news. I confess that I am not impartial in my  sympathies here; and that the newspaper phrase I quoted strikes me as a  blunder about the very nature of life. I do not, in my private capacity,  believe that a baby gets his best physical food by sucking his thumb;  nor that a man gets his best moral food by sucking his soul, and denying  its dependence on God or other good things. I would maintain that thanks  are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled  by wonder. But this faith in receptiveness, and in respect for things  outside oneself, need here do no more than help me in explaining what  any version of this epoch ought in any case to explain. In nothing is  the modern German more modern, or more mad, than in his dream of finding  a German name for everything; eating his language, or in other words  biting his tongue. And in nothing were the mediaevals more free and sane  than in their acceptance of names and emblems from outside their most  beloved limits. The monastery would often not only take in the stranger  but almost canonize him. A mere adventurer like Bruce was enthroned and  thanked as if he had really come as a knight errant. And a passionately  patriotic community more often than not had a foreigner for a patron  saint. Thus crowds of saints were Irishmen, but St. Patrick was not an  Irishman. Thus as the English gradually became a nation, they left the  numberless Saxon saints in a sense behind them, passed over by  comparison not only the sanctity of Edward but the solid fame of Alfred,  and invoked a half mythical hero, striving in an eastern desert against  an impossible monster.    That transition and that symbol stand for the Crusades. In their romance  and reality they were the first English experience of learning, not only  from the external, but the remote. England, like every Christian thing,  had thriven on outer things without shame. From the roads of Caesar to  the churches of Lanfranc, it had sought its meat from God. But now the  eagles were on the wing, scenting a more distant slaughter; they were  seeking the strange things instead of receiving them. The English had  stepped from acceptance to adventure, and the epic of their ships had  begun. The scope of the great religious movement which swept England  along with all the West would distend a book like this into huge  disproportion, yet it would be much better to do so than to dismiss it  in the distant and frigid fashion common in such short summaries. The  inadequacy of our insular method in popular history is perfectly shown  in the treatment of Richard Coeur de Lion. His tale is told with the  implication that his departure for the Crusade was something like the  escapade of a schoolboy running away to sea. It was, in this view, a  pardonable or lovable prank; whereas in truth it was more like a  responsible Englishman now going to the Front. Christendom was nearly  one nation, and the Front was the Holy Land. That Richard himself was of  an adventurous and even romantic temper is true, though it is not  unreasonably romantic for a born soldier to do the work he does best.  But the point of the argument against insular history is particularly  illustrated here by the absence of a continental comparison. In this  case we have only to step across the Straits of Dover to find the  fallacy. Philip Augustus, Richard's contemporary in France, had the name  of a particularly cautious and coldly public-spirited statesman; yet  Philip Augustus went on the same Crusade. The reason was, of course,  that the Crusades were, for all thoughtful Europeans, things of the  highest statesmanship and the purest public spirit.    Some six hundred years after Christianity sprang up in the East and  swept westwards, another great faith arose in almost the same eastern  lands and followed it like its gigantic shadow. Like a shadow, it was at  once a copy and a contrary. We call it Islam, or the creed of the  Moslems; and perhaps its most explanatory description is that it was the  final flaming up of the accumulated Orientalisms, perhaps of the  accumulated Hebraisms, gradually rejected as the Church grew more  European, or as Christianity turned into Christendom. Its highest  motive was a hatred of idols, and in its view Incarnation was itself an  idolatry. The two things it persecuted were the idea of God being made  flesh and of His being afterwards made wood or stone. A study of the  questions smouldering in the track of the prairie fire of the Christian  conversion favours the suggestion that this fanaticism against art or  mythology was at once a development and a reaction from that conversion,  a sort of minority report of the Hebraists. In this sense Islam was  something like a Christian heresy. The early heresies had been full of  mad reversals and evasions of the Incarnation, rescuing their Jesus from  the reality of his body even at the expense of the sincerity of his  soul. And the Greek Iconoclasts had poured into Italy, breaking the  popular statues and denouncing the idolatry of the Pope, until routed,  in a style sufficiently symbolic, by the sword of the father of  Charlemagne. It was all these disappointed negations that took fire from  the genius of Mahomet, and launched out of the burning lands a cavalry  charge that nearly conquered the world. And if it be suggested that a  note on such Oriental origins is rather remote from a history of  England, the answer is that this book may, alas! contain many  digressions, but that this is not a digression. It is quite peculiarly  necessary to keep in mind that this Semite god haunted Christianity like  a ghost; to remember it in every European corner, but especially in our  corner. If any one doubts the necessity, let him take a walk to all the  parish churches in England within a radius of thirty miles, and ask why  this stone virgin is headless or that coloured glass is gone. He will  soon learn that it was lately, and in his own lanes and homesteads, that  the ecstasy of the deserts returned, and his bleak northern island was  filled with the fury of the Iconoclasts.    It was an element in this sublime and yet sinister simplicity of Islam  that it knew no boundaries. Its very home was homeless. For it was born  in a sandy waste among nomads, and it went everywhere because it came  from nowhere. But in the Saracens of the early Middle Ages this nomadic  quality in Islam was masked by a high civilization, more scientific if  less creatively artistic than that of contemporary Christendom. The  Moslem monotheism was, or appeared to be, the more rationalist religion  of the two. This rootless refinement was characteristically advanced in  abstract things, of which a memory remains in the very name of algebra.  In comparison the Christian civilization was still largely instinctive,  but its instincts were very strong and very much the other way. It was  full of local affections, which found form in that system of _fences_  which runs like a pattern through everything mediaeval, from heraldry to  the holding of land. There was a shape and colour in all their customs  and statutes which can be seen in all their tabards and escutcheons;  something at once strict and gay. This is not a departure from the  interest in external things, but rather a part of it. The very welcome  they would often give to a stranger from beyond the wall was a  recognition of the wall. Those who think their own life all-sufficient  do not see its limit as a wall, but as the end of the world. The"]]]
