Homer is so called from the river Mel[^e]s (2  _syl._), in Asia Minor, on the banks of which some say he was born.                ... various measured verse,      AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,      And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,      Blind Melesig[=e]n[^e]s, thence Homer called,      Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.        Milton, _Paradise Regained_ (1671).      =Melema= (_Tito_). Beautiful accomplished Greek adventurer who marries and  is unfaithful to Romola. He dies by the hand of an old man who had been  the benefactor of his infancy and youth, and whom he had basely deserted  and ignored.--George Eliot, _Romola_.      =Me'li= (_Giovanni_), a Sicilian, born at Palermo; immortalized by his  eclogues and idylls. Meli is called \"The Sicilian Theocritus\"  (1740-1815).        Much it pleased him to peruse      The songs of the Sicilian Muse--      Bucolic songs by Meli sung.        Longfellow, _The Wayside Inn_ (prelude, 1863).      =Meliadus=, father of Sir Tristan; prince of Lyonnesse, and one of the  heroes of Arthurian romance.--_Tristan de Leonois_ (1489).    [Asterism] Tristan, in the _History of Prince Arthur_, compiled by Sir  T. Malory (1470), is called \"Tristram;\" but the old minnesingers of  Germany (twelfth century) called the name \"Tristan.\"      =Mel'ibe= (3 _syl._), a rich young man married to Prudens. One day, when  Melib[^e] was in the fields, some enemies broke into his house, beat his  wife, and wounded his daughter Sophie in her feet, hands, ears, nose and  mouth. Melib[^e] was furious and vowed vengeance, but Prudens persuaded  him \"to forgive his enemies, and to do good to those who despitefully  used him.\" So he called together his enemies, and forgave them, to the  end that \"God of His endeles mercie wole at the tyme of oure deyinge  forgive us oure giltes that we have trespased to Him in this wreeched  world.\"--Chaucer, _Canterbury Tales_ (1388).    [Asterism] This prose tale is a liberal translation of a French  story.--See _MS. Reg._, xix. 7; and _MS. Reg._, xix. 11, British Museum.      =Melibee=, a shepherd, and the reputed father of Pastorella. Pastorella  married Sir Calidore.--Spenser, _Fa[:e]ry Queen_, vi. 9 (1596).    \"Melibee\" is Sir Francis Walsingham. In the _Ruins of Time_, Spenser  calls him \"Meliboe.\" Sir Philip Sidney (the \"Sir Calidore\" of the  _Fa[:e]ry Queen_) married his daughter Frances. Sir Francis Walsingham  died in 1590, so poor that he did not leave enough to defray his funeral  expenses.      =Meliboeus=, one of the shepherds in _Eclogue_ i. of Virgil.    Spenser, in the _Ruins of Time_ (1591), calls Sir Francis Walsingham  \"the good Meliboe;\" and in the last book of the _Fa[:e]ry Queen_ he calls  him \"Melibee.\"      =Melin'da=, cousin of Sylvia. She loves Worthy, whom she pretends to  dislike, and coquets with him for twelve months. Having driven her  modest lover to the verge of distraction, she relents, and consents to  marry him.--G. Farquhar, _The Recruiting Officer_ (1705).      =Mel'ior=, a lovely fairy, who carried off, in her magic bark,  Parthen'opex, of Blois, to her secret island.--_Parthenopex de Blois_ (a  French romance, twelfth century).      =Melisen'dra= (_The princess_), natural daughter of Marsilio, and the  \"supposed daughter of Charlemagne.\" She eloped with Don Gayferos. The  king, Marsilio, sent his troops in pursuit of the fugitive. Having made  Melisendra his wife, Don Gayferos delivered her up captive to the Moors  at Saragossa. This was the story of the puppet-show of Master Peter,  exhibited to Don Quixote and his squire at \"the inn beyond the  hermitage.\"--Cervantes, _Don Quixote_, II. ii. 7 (1615).      =Melissa=, a prophetess who lived in Merlin's cave. Bradamant gave her the  enchanted ring to take to Roge'ro; so, under the form of Atlant[^e]s, she  went to Alc[=i]na's isle, delivered Rog[=e]ro, and disenchanted all the  captives in the island.    In bk. xix. Melissa, under the form of Rod[)o]mont, persuaded Agramant  to break the league which was to settle the contest by single combat,  and a general battle ensued.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).    [Asterism] This incident of bk. xix. is similar to that in Homer's  _Iliad_, iii. iv., where Paris and Menel[=a]os agree to settle the  contest by single combat; but Minerva persuades Pand[)a]ros to break  the truce, and a general battle ensues.      =Me'lita= (now _Malta_). The point to which the vessel that carried St.  Paul was driven was the \"Porto de San Paolo,\" and according to  tradition, the cathedral of Citta Vecchia stands on the site of the  house of Publius, the Roman governor. St. Paul's grotto, a cave in the  vicinity, is so named in honor of this great apostle.      =Meli'tus=, a gentleman of Cyprus, in the drama called _The Laws of  Candy_, by Beaumont and Fletcher (1647).      =Melizyus=, king of Thessaly, in the golden era of Saturn. He was the  first to tame horses for the use of man.    _Melizyus_ (_King_) held his court in the Tower of Chivalry, and there  knighted Graunde Amoure, after giving him the following advice:        And first _Good Hope_ his legge harneyes should be;      His habergion, of _Perfect Ryhteousnes_,      Gird first with the girdle of _Chastitie_;      His rich placarde should be good busines,      Brodred with _Alms_ ...      The helmet _Mekenes_, and the shelde _Good Fayeth_,      His swerde _God's Word_, as St. Paule sayeth.        Stephen Hawes, _The Passe-tyme of Plesure_, xxviii. (1515).      =Mell= (_Mr._), the poor, down-trodden second master at Salem House, the  school of Mr. Creakles. Mr. Mell played the flute. His mother lived in  an almshouse, and Steerforth used to taunt Mell with this \"degradation,\"  and indeed caused him to be discharged. Mell emigrated to Australia, and  succeeded well in the new country.--C. Dickens, _David Copperfield_  (1849).      =Melle'font= (2 _syl._), in love with Cynthia, daughter of Sir Paul  Pliant. His aunt, Lady Touchwood, had a criminal fondness for him, and,  because he repelled her advances, she vowed his ruin. After passing  several hair-breadth escapes from the \"double dealing\" of his aunt and  his \"friend,\" Maskwell, he succeeded in winning and marrying the lady of  his attachment.--W. Congreve, _The Double Dealer_ (1700).      =Mellifluous Doctor= (_The_), St. Bernard, whose writings were called \"a  river of paradise\" (1091-1153).      =Melnotte= (_Claude_), a gardener's son, in love with Pauline, \"the Beauty  of Lyons,\" but treated by her with contempt. Beauseant and Glavis, two  other rejected suitors, conspired with him to humble the proud fair one.  To this end, Claude assumed to be the prince of Como, and Pauline  married him, but was indignant when she discovered how she had been  duped. Claude left her to join the French army, and, under the name of  Morier, rose in two years and a half to the rank of colonel. He then  returned to Lyons, and found his father-in-law on the eve of bankruptcy,  and Pauline about to be sold to Beauseant to pay the creditors. Claude  paid the money required, and claimed Pauline as his loving and truthful  wife.--Lord L. B. Lytton, _Lady of Lyons_ (1838).      =Melo= (_Juan de_), born at Castile in the fifteenth century. A dispute  having arisen at Esalo'na upon the question whether Achill[^e]s or Hector  were the braver warrior, the Marquis de Ville'na called out, \"Let us see  if the advocates of Achill[^e]s can fight as well as prate.\" At the word,  there appeared in the assembly a gigantic fire-breathing monster, which  repeated the same challenge. Every one shrank back except Juan de Melo,  who drew his sword and placed himself before King Juan II. to protect  him, \"tide life, tide death.\" The king appointed him alcayd[^e] of Alcala  la Real, in Grana'da, for his loyalty.--_Chronica de Don Alvaro de  Luna._      =Melrose= (_Violet_), an heiress, who marries Charles Middlewick. This was  against the consent of his father, because Violet had the bad taste to  snub the retired tradesman, and considered vulgarity as the  \"unpardonable sin.\"    _Mary Melrose_, Violet's cousin, but without a penny. She marries Talbot  Champneys; but his father, Sir Geoffrey, wanted him to marry Violet, the  heiress.--H. J. Byron, _Our Boys_ (a comedy, 1875).      =Melusi'na=, the most famous of the _f['e]es_ of France. Having enclosed  her father in a mountain for offending her mother, she was condemned to  become a serpent every Saturday. When she married the count of Lusignan,  she made her husband vow never to visit her on that day, but the  jealousy of the count made him break his vow. Melusina was, in  consequence, obliged to leave her mortal husband, and roam about the  world as a ghost till the day of doom. Some say the count immured her in  the dungeon wall of his castle.--_Jean d'Arras_ (fourteenth century).    [Asterism] The cry of despair given by the _f['e]e_ when she discovered  the indiscreet visit of her husband, is the origin of the phrase, _Un  cri de M['e]lusine_ (\"A shriek of despair\").      =Melvil= (_Sir John_), a young baronet, engaged to be married to Miss  Sterling, the elder daughter of a City merchant, who promises to settle  on her [pounds]800,000. A little before the marriage, Sir John finds  that he has no regard for Miss Sterling, but a great love for her  younger sister, Fanny, to whom he makes a proposal of marriage. His  proposal is rejected; and it is soon brought to light that Miss Fanny  had been clandestinely married to Lovewell for four months.--Colman and  Garrick, _The Clandestine Marriage_ (1766).      =Melville= (_Major_), a magistrate at Cairnvreckan village.--Sir W.

Then Johnny Chuck began to dig  again, but this time he wasn't making his new back door.  No indeed!  Johnny Chuck was digging at that new mound of yellow gravel of which he  had been so proud.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun blinked to be sure that  he saw aright, for Johnny Chuck was _filling up his new home_ between  the roots of the old apple tree.  When he got through, there wasn't any  new home.    Then Johnny Chuck brushed his coat carefully, shook the sand out of his  trousers, wiped his hands and started off for his old home.  And this  time he didn't take his special hidden path, for Johnny Chuck didn't  care who saw him go.    Late that afternoon, Johnny Chuck sat on his old doorstep, with his  chin in his hands, watching Old Mother West Wind gathering her Merry  Little Breezes into the big bag in which she carries them to their home  behind the Purple Hills.    \"'Whisper a secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole  world.'  Now what did Grandfather Frog mean by that?\" thought Johnny  Chuck.  \"Now I didn't tell anybody but Jimmy Skunk and Jimmy Skunk  didn't tell anyone but Peter Rabbit and--and--\"    Then Johnny Chuck began to chuckle and finally to laugh.  \"'Whisper a  secret to a friend and you shout it in the ear of the whole world.'  My  gracious, what a loud voice I must have had and didn't know it!\" said  Johnny Chuck, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes.    And the next day Johnny Chuck started to make a new home.  Where?  Oh,  that's Johnny Chuck's secret.  And no one but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun  has found it out yet.          VIII    JOHNNY CHUCK'S GREAT FIGHT    Johnny Chuck sat on the doorstep of his new home, looking away across  the Green Meadows.  Johnny Chuck felt very well satisfied with himself  and with all the world.  He yawned lazily and stretched and stretched  and then settled himself comfortably to watch the Merry Little Breezes  playing down by the Smiling Pool.    By and by he saw Peter Rabbit go bobbing along down the Lone Little  Path.  Lipperty, lipperty, lip, went Peter Rabbit and every other jump  he looked behind him.    \"Now what is Peter Rabbit up to?\" said Johnny Chuck to himself, \"and  what does he keep looking behind him for?\"    Johnny Chuck sat up a little straighter to watch Peter Rabbit hop down  the Lone Little Path.  Then of a sudden he caught sight of something  that made him sit up straighter than ever and open his eyes very wide.  Something was following Peter Rabbit.  Yes, Sir, something was bobbing  along right at Peter Rabbit's heels.    Johnny Chuck forgot the Merry Little Breezes.  He forgot how warm it  was and how lazy he felt.  He forgot everything else in his curiosity  to learn what it could be following so closely at Peter Rabbit's heels.    Presently Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very straight and  then--Johnny Chuck nearly tumbled over in sheer surprise!  He rubbed  his eyes to make sure that he saw aright, for there were two Peter  Rabbits!  Yes, Sir, there were _two_ Peter Rabbits, only one was very  small, very small indeed.    \"Oh!\" said Johnny Chuck, \"that must be Peter Rabbit's baby brother!\"    Then he began to chuckle till his fat sides shook.  There sat Peter  Rabbit with his funny long ears standing straight up, and there right  behind him, dressed exactly like him, sat Peter Rabbit's baby brother  with _his_ funny little long ears standing straight up.  When Peter  Rabbit wiggled _his_ right ear, his baby brother wiggled his right ear.  When Peter Rabbit scratched his left ear, his baby brother scratched  _his_ left ear.  Whatever Peter Rabbit did, his baby brother did too.    Presently Peter Rabbit started on down the Lone Little Path--lipperty,  lipperty, lip, and right at his heels went his baby brother--lipperty,  lipperty, lip.  Johnny Chuck watched them out of sight, and then he  settled himself on his doorstep once more to enjoy a sun bath.  Every  once in a while he chuckled to himself as he remembered how funny Peter  Rabbit's baby brother had looked.  Presently Johnny Chuck fell asleep.    Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed quite high in the sky when Johnny  Chuck awoke.  He yawned and stretched and stretched and yawned, and  then he sat up to look over the Green Meadows.  Then he became wide  awake, very wide awake indeed!  Way down on the Green Meadows he caught  a glimpse of something red jumping about in the long meadow grass.    \"That must be Reddy Fox,\" thought Johnny Chuck.  \"Yes, it surely is  Reddy Fox.  Now I wonder what mischief he is up to.\"    Then he saw all the Merry Little Breezes racing towards Reddy Fox as  fast as they could go.  And there was Sammy Jay screaming at the top of  his voice, and his cousin, Blacky the Crow.  Happy Jack Squirrel was  dancing up and down excitedly on the branch of an old elm close by.    Johnny Chuck waited to see no more, but started down the Lone Little  Path to find out what it all was about.  Half way down the Lone Little  Path he met Peter Rabbit running as hard as he could.  His long ears  were laid flat back, his big eyes seemed to pop right out of his head,  and he was running as Johnny Chuck had never seen him run before.    \"What are you running so for, Peter Rabbit?\" asked Johnny Chuck.    \"To get Bowser the Hound,\" shouted Peter Rabbit over his shoulder, as  he tried to run faster.    \"Now what can be the matter?\" said Johnny Chuck to himself, \"to send  Peter Rabbit after Bowser the Hound?\"  He knew that, like all the other  little meadow people, there was nothing of which Peter Rabbit was so  afraid as Farmer Brown's great dog, Bowser the Hound.    Johnny Chuck hurried down the Lone Little Path as fast as his short  legs could take his fat, rolly-poly self.    Presently he came out onto the Green Meadows, and there he saw a sight  that set every nerve in his round little body a-tingle with rage.    Reddy Fox had found Peter Rabbit's baby brother and was doing his best  to frighten him to death.    \"I'm going to eat you now,\" shouted Reddy Fox, and then he sprang on  Peter Rabbit's baby brother and gave him a cuff that sent him heels  over head sprawling in the grass.    \"Coward!  Coward, Reddy Fox!\" shrieked Sammy Jay.    \"Shame!  Shame!\" shouted the Merry Little Breezes.    \"You're nothing but a great big bully!\" yelled Blacky the Crow.    But no one did anything to help Peter Rabbit's baby brother, for Reddy  Fox is so much bigger than any of the rest of them, except Bobby Coon,  that all the little meadow people are afraid of him.    But Reddy Fox just laughed at them, and nipped the long ears of Peter  Rabbit's little brother so hard that he cried with the pain.    Now all were so intent watching Reddy Fox torment the baby brother of  Peter Rabbit that no one had seen Johnny Chuck coming down the Lone  Little Path.  And for a few minutes no one recognized the furious  little yellow-brown bundle that suddenly knocked Reddy Fox over and  seized him by the throat.  You see it didn't look a bit like Johnny  Chuck.  Every hair was standing on end, he was so mad, and this made  him appear twice as big as they had ever seen him before.    \"Coward!  Coward!  Coward!\" shrieked Johnny Chuck as he shook Reddy Fox  by the throat.  And then began the greatest fight that the Green  Meadows had ever seen.    Now Johnny Chuck is not naturally a fighter.  Oh my, no!  He is so  good-natured and so sunny-hearted that he seldom quarrels with any one.  But when he has to fight, there isn't a cowardly hair on him, not the  teeniest, weeniest one.  No one ever has a chance to cry, \"'Fraid cat!  Cry baby!\" after Johnny Chuck.    So though, like all the other little meadow people, he was usually just  a little afraid of Reddy Fox, because Reddy is so much bigger, he  forgot all about it as soon as he caught sight of Reddy Fox tormenting  Peter Rabbit's little brother.  He didn't stop to think of what might  happen to himself.  He didn't stop to think at all.  He just gritted  his teeth and in a flash had Reddy Fox on his back.    Such a fight was never seen before on the Green Meadows!  Reddy Fox is  a bully and a coward, for he never fights with any one of his own size  if he can help it, but when he has to fight, he fights hard.  And he  certainly had to fight now.    \"Bully!\" hissed Johnny Chuck as with his stout little hind feet he  ripped the bright red coat of Reddy Fox.  \"You great big bully!\"    Over and over they rolled, Johnny Chuck on top, then Reddy Fox on top,  then Johnny Chuck up again, clawing and snarling.    It seemed as if news of the fight had gone over all the Green Meadows,  for the little meadow people came running from every direction--Billy  Mink, Little Joe Otter, Jerry Muskrat, Striped Chipmunk, Jimmy Skunk,  old Mr. Toad.  Even Great-Grandfather Frog, who left his big lily pad,  and came hurrying with great jumps across the Green Meadows.  They  formed a ring around Reddy Fox and Johnny Chuck and danced with  excitement.  And all wanted Johnny Chuck to win.    Peter Rabbit's poor little brother, so sore and lame from the knocking  about from Reddy Fox, and so frightened that he hardly dared breathe,  lay flat on the ground under a little bush and was forgotten by all but  the Merry Little Breezes, who covered him up with some dead grass, and  kissed him and whispered to him not to be afraid now.  How Peter  Rabbit's little brother did hope that Johnny Chuck would win!  His  great, big, round, soft eyes were wide with terror as he thought of  what might happen to him if Reddy Fox should whip Johnny Chuck.    But Reddy Fox wasn't whipping Johnny Chuck.  Try as he would, he could  not get a good hold on that round, fat, little body.  And Johnny  Chuck's stout claws were ripping his red coat and white vest and Johnny  Chuck's sharp teeth were gripping him so that they could not be shaken"]]]
