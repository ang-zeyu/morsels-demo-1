But come now, where are your things?\" asked  Deta.    \"I won't come,\" Heidi replied.    \"What?\" Deta said passionately. But changing her tone, she continued  in a more friendly manner: \"Come now; you don't understand me. I am  taking you to the most beautiful place you have ever seen.\" After  packing up Heidi's clothes she said again, \"Come, child, and take your  hat. It is not very nice, but we can't help it.\"    \"I shall not come,\" was the reply.    \"Don't be stupid and obstinate, like a goat. Listen to me. Grandfather  is sending us away and we must do what he commands, or he will get  more angry still. You'll see how fine it is in Frankfurt. If you do  not like it, you can come home again and by that time grandfather will  have forgiven us.\"    \"Can I come home again to-night?\" asked Heidi.    \"Come now, I told you you could come back. If we get to Mayenfeld  today, we can take the train to-morrow. That will make you fly home  again in the shortest time!\"    Holding the bundle, Deta led the child down the mountain. On their  way they met Peter, who had not gone to school that day. The boy  thought it was a more useful occupation to look for hazel-rods than to  learn to read, for he always needed the rods. He had had a most  successful day, for he carried an enormous bundle on his shoulder.  When he caught sight of Heidi and Deta, he asked them where they were  going.    \"I am going to Frankfurt with Aunt Deta,\" Heidi replied; \"but first I  must see grandmother, for she is waiting.\"    \"Oh no, it is too late. You can see her when you come back, but not  now,\" said Deta, pulling Heidi along with her, for she was afraid that  the old woman might detain the child.    Peter ran into the cottage and hit the table with his rods. The  grandmother jumped up in her fright and asked him what that meant.    \"They have taken Heidi away,\" Peter said with a groan.    \"Who has, Peter? Where has she gone?\" the unhappy grandmother asked.  Brigida had seen Deta walking up the footpath a short while ago and  soon they guessed what had happened. With a trembling hand the old  woman opened a window and called out as loudly as she could: \"Deta,  Deta, don't take the child away. Don't take her from us.\"    When Heidi heard that she struggled to get free, and said: \"I must go  to grandmother; she is calling me.\"    But Deta would not let her go. She urged her on by saying that she  might return soon again. She also suggested that Heidi might bring a  lovely present to the grandmother when she came back.    Heidi liked this prospect and followed Deta without more ado. After a  while she asked: \"What shall I bring to the grandmother?\"    \"You might bring her some soft white rolls, Heidi. I think the black  bread is too hard for poor grandmother to eat.\"    \"Yes, I know, aunt, she always gives it to Peter,\" Heidi confirmed  her. \"We must go quickly now; we might get to Frankfurt today and  then I can be back tomorrow with the rolls.\"       [Illustration: WHEN HEIDI HEARD THAT SHE STRUGGLED TO GET FREE]    Heidi was running now, and Deta had to follow. She was glad enough to  escape the questions that people might ask her in the village. People  could see that Heidi was pulling her along, so she said: \"I can't  stop. Don't you see how the child is hurrying? We have still far to  go,\" whenever she heard from all sides: \"Are you taking her with you?\"  \"Is she running away from the uncle?\" \"What a wonder she is still  alive!\" \"What red cheeks she has,\" and so on. Soon they had escaped  and had left the village far behind them.    From that time on the uncle looked more angry than ever when he came  to the village. Everybody was afraid of him, and the women would warn  their children to keep out of his sight.    He came down but seldom, and then only to sell his cheese and buy his  provisions. Often people remarked how lucky it was that Heidi had left  him. They had seen her hurrying away, so they thought that she had  been glad to go.    The old grandmother alone stuck to him faithfully. Whenever anybody  came up to her, she would tell them what good care the old man had  taken of Heidi. She also told them that he had mended her little  house. These reports reached the village, of course, but people only  half believed them, for the grandmother was infirm and old. She began  her days with sighing again. \"All happiness has left us with the  child. The days are so long and dreary, and I have no joy left. If  only I could hear Heidi's voice before I die,\" the poor old woman  would exclaim, day after day.    [Illustration]          VI    A NEW CHAPTER WITH NEW THINGS      In a beautiful house in Frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of  Clara Sesemann. She was sitting in a comfortable rolling-chair, which  could be pushed from room to room. Clara spent most of her time in the  study, where long rows of bookcases lined the walls. This room was  used as a living-room, and here she was also given her lessons.    Clara had a pale, thin face with soft blue eyes, which at that moment  were watching the clock impatiently. At last she said: \"Oh Miss  Rottenmeier, isn't it time yet?\"    The lady so addressed was the housekeeper, who had lived with Clara  since Mrs. Sesemann's death. Miss Rottenmeier wore a peculiar uniform  with a long cape, and a high cap on her head. Clara's father, who was  away from home a great deal, left the entire management of the house  to this lady, on the condition that his daughter's wishes should  always be considered.    While Clara was waiting, Deta had arrived at the front door with  Heidi. She was asking the coachman who had brought her if she could go  upstairs.    \"That's not my business,\" grumbled the coachman; \"you must ring for  the butler.\"    Sebastian, the butler, a man with large brass buttons on his coat,  soon stood before her.    \"May I see Miss Rottenmeier?\" Deta asked.    \"That's not my business,\" the butler announced. \"Ring for Tinette, the  maid.\" With that, he disappeared.    Deta, ringing again, saw a girl with a brilliant white cap on her  head, coming down the stairway. The maid stopped half-way down and  asked scornfully: \"What do you want?\"    Deta repeated her wish again. Tinette told her to wait while she went  upstairs, but it did not take long before the two were asked to come  up.    Following the maid, they found themselves in the study. Deta held on  to Heidi's hand and stayed near the door.    Miss Rottenmeier, slowly getting up, approached the newcomers. She did  not seem pleased with Heidi, who wore her hat and shawl and was  looking up at the lady's headdress with innocent wonder.    \"What is your name?\" the lady asked.    \"Heidi,\" was the child's clear answer.    \"What? Is that a Christian name? What name did you receive in  baptism?\" inquired the lady again.    \"I don't remember that any more,\" the child replied.    \"What an answer! What does that mean?\" said the housekeeper, shaking  her head. \"Is the child ignorant or pert, Miss Deta?\"    \"I shall speak for the child, if I may, madam,\" Deta said, after  giving Heidi a little blow for her unbecoming answer. \"The child has  never been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave. I  hope the lady will forgive her manners. She is called Adelheid after  her mother, who was my sister.\"    \"Oh well, that is better. But Miss Deta, the child seems peculiar for  her age. I thought I told you that Miss Clara's companion would have  to be twelve years old like her, to be able to share her studies. How  old is Adelheid?\"    \"I am sorry, but I am afraid she is somewhat younger than I thought. I  think she is about ten years old.\"    \"Grandfather said that I was eight years old,\" said Heidi now. Deta  gave her another blow, but as the child had no idea why, she did not  get embarrassed.    \"What, only eight years old!\" Miss Rottenmeier exclaimed indignantly.  \"How can we get along? What have you learned? What books have you  studied?\"    \"None,\" said Heidi.    \"But how did you learn to read?\"    \"I can't read and Peter can't do it either,\" Heidi retorted.    \"For mercy's sake! you cannot read?\" cried the lady in her surprise.  \"How is it possible? What else have you studied?\"    \"Nothing,\" replied Heidi, truthfully.    \"Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?\" said the housekeeper,  when she was more composed.    Deta, however, was not easily intimidated, and said: \"I am sorry, but  I thought this child would suit you. She _is_ small, but older  children are often spoilt and not like her. I must go now, for my  mistress is waiting. As soon as I can, I'll come to see how the child  is getting along.\" With a bow she was outside and with a few quick  steps hurried down-stairs.    Miss Rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back, for she  wanted to ask Deta a number of questions.    Heidi was still standing on the same spot. Clara had watched the  scene, and called to the child now to come to her.    Heidi approached the rolling-chair.    \"Do you want to be called Heidi or Adelheid?\" asked Clara.    \"My name is Heidi and nothing else,\" was the child's answer.    \"I'll call you Heidi then, for I like it very much,\" said Clara. \"I  have never heard the name before. What curly hair you have! Was it  always like that?\"    \"I think so.\"    \"Did you like to come to Frankfurt?\" asked Clara again.    \"Oh, no, but then I am going home again to-morrow, and shall bring  grandmother some soft white rolls,\" Heidi explained.    \"What a curious child you are,\" said Clara. \"You have come to  Frankfurt to stay with me, don't you know that? We shall have our  lessons together, and I think it will be great fun when you learn to  read. Generally the morning seems to have no end, for Mr. Candidate  comes at ten and stays till two. That is a long time, and he has to  yawn himself, he gets so tired. Miss Rottenmeier and he both yawn  together behind their books, but when I do it, Miss Rottenmeier"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#9)"],[1,"de fire and listen to our  Mammy and Pappy tell ghost tales and witch tales. I don't guess dey  was sho' nuff so, but we all thought dey was.    My Mammy was bought in Virginia by our Master, Hugh McKeown. He owned  a big plantation in Georgia. Soon after she come to Georgia she  married my pa. Old Master was good to us. We lived for a while in the  quarters behind the Big House, and my mammy was de house woman.    Somehow, in a trade, or maybe my pa was mortgaged, but anyway old  Master let a man in Virginia have him and we never see him no more  'till after the War. It nigh broke our hearts when he had to leave and  old Master sho' done everything he could to make it up to us.    There was four of us chillun. I didn't do no work 'till I was about  fifteen years old. Old Master bought a tavern and mammy worked as  house woman and I went to work at the stables. I drove the carriage  and took keer of the team and carriage. I kept 'em shining too. I'd  curry the horses 'till they was slick and shiny. I'd polish the  harness and the carriage. Old Master and Mistress was quality and I  wanted everybody to know it. They had three girls and three boys and  we boys played together and went swimming together. We loved each  other, I tell ye.    Old Master built us a little house jest back of de tavern and mammy  raised us jest like Old Mistress did her chillun. When I didn't have  to work de boys and me would go hunting. We'd kill possum, coon,  squirrels and wild hogs. Old Master killed a wild hog and he give  mammy her ten tiny pigs. She raised 'em and my, at the meat we had  when they was butchered.    They had lots of company at de Big House, and it was de only tavern  too, so they was lots of cooking to do. They would go to church on  Sunday and they would spread their dinners on the ground. My, but they  was feasts. We'd allus git to go as I drive the carriage and mammy  looked after the food. We had our own church too, with our own  preacher.    We had a spinning house where all the old women would card and spin  wool in de winter and cotton in de summer. Dey made all our clothes,  what few we wore. Us boys just wore long tailed shirts 'till we was 12  or 13 years old, sometimes older. I was 15 when I started driving the  fambly carriage and I got to put on pants then.    Our suits was made out of jeans. That cloth wore like buckskin. We'd  wear 'em for a year before they had to be patched.    We made our own brogan shoes too. We'd kill a beef and skin it and  spread the skin out and let it dry a while. We'd put the hide in lime  water to get the hair off, then we'd oil it and work it 'till it was  soft. Next we'd take it to the bench and scrape or 'plesh' it with  knives. It was then put in a tight cabinet and smoked with oak wood  for about 24 hours. Smoking loosened the skin. We'd then take it out  and rub it to soften it. It was blacked and oiled and it was ready to  be made into shoes. It took nearly a year to get a green hide made  into shoes. Twan't no wonder we had to go barefooted.    Sometimes I'd work in the wood shop, dressing wagon spokes. We made  spokes with a plane, by hand on a bench.    I didn't have much work to do before I was 15 except to run errands.  One of my jobs was to take corn to the mill to be ground into meal.  Some one would put my sack of corn on the mule's back and help me up  and I'd ride to the mill and have it ground and they'd load me back on  and I'd go back home.    I remember once my meal fell off and I waited and waited for somebody  to come by and help me. I got tired waiting so I toted the sack to a  big log and laid it acrost it. I led my mule up to the log and after  working hard for a long time I managed to get it on his back. I  climbed up and jest as we started off the mule jumped and I fell off  and pulled the sack off with me. I couldn't do nothing but wait and  finally old Master came after me. He knowed something was wrong.    Old Master was good to all of his slaves but his overseers had orders  to make 'em work. He fed 'em good and took good keer of 'em and never  made 'em work iffen they was sick or even felt bad. They was two  things old Master jest wouldn't 'bide and dat was for a slave to be  sassy or lazy. Sometimes if dey wouldn't work or slipped off de farm  dey would whip 'em. He didn't whip often. Colored overseers was worse  to whip than white ones, but Master allus said, \"Hadn't you all rather  have a nigger overseer than a white one? I don't want to white man  over my niggers.\" I've seen the overseer whip some but I never did  get no whipping. He would strip 'em to the waist and whip 'em with a  long leather strop, about as wide as two fingers and fastened to a  handle.    When de war broke out everthing was changed. My young Masters had to  go. T. H. McKeown, the oldest was a Lieutenant and was one of the  first to go. It nigh broke all of our hearts. Pretty soon he sent for  me to come and keep him company. Old Master let me go and I stayed in  his quarters. He was stationed at Atlanta and Griffin, Georgia. I'd  stay with him a week or two and I'd go home for a few days and I'd  take back food and fruit. I stayed with him and waited on him 'till he  got used to being in the army and they moved him out to fighting. I  wanted to go on with him but he wouldn't let me, he told me to go back  and take care of Old Master and Old Mistress. They was getting old by  then. Purty soon Young Master got wounded purty bad and they sent me  home. I never went back. I got a \"pass\" to go home. Course, after the  war nothing was right no more. Yes, we was free but we didn't know  what to do. We didn't want to leave our old Master and our old home.  We stayed on and after a while my pappy come home to us. Dat was de  best thing about de war setting us free, he could come back to us.    We all lived on at the old plantation. Old Master and old Mistress  died and young Master took charge of de farm. He couldn't a'done  nothing without us niggers. He didn't know how to work. He was good to  us and divided the crops with us.    I never went to school much but my white folks learned me to read and  write. I could always have any of their books to read, and they had  lots of 'em.    Times has changed a lot since that time. I don't know where the world  is much better now, that it has everthing or then when we didn't have  hardly nothing, but I believe there was more religion then. We always  went to church and I've seen 'em baptize from in the early morning  'till afternoon in the Chatahooche river. Folks don't hardly know  nowadays jest what to believe they's so many religions, but they's  only one God.    I was eighteen when I married. I had eight chillun. My wife is 86, and  she lives in St. Louis, Missouri.

What yo' gwine do when de meat come in?      What yo' gwine do when de meat come in?        Set in de corner wid a greasy chin!      Lawsy!\"    Dat's about de only little nigger song I know, less'n it be de one  about:        \"Great big nigger, laying 'hind de log--      Finger on de trigger and eye on the hawg!      Click go de trigger and bang go de gun!      Here come de owner and de buck nigger run!\"    And I think I learn both of dem long after I been grown, 'cause I  belong to a full-blood Creek Indian and I didn't know nothing but  Creek talk long after de Civil War. My mistress was part white and  knowed English talk, but she never did talk it because none of de  people talked it. I heard it sometime, but it sound like whole lot of  wild shoat in de cedar brake scared at something when I do hear it.  Dat was when I was little girl in time of de War.    I don't know where I been born. Nobody never did tell me. But my mammy  and pappy git me after de War and I know den whose child I is. De men  at de Creek Agency help 'em git me, I reckon, maybe.    First thing I remember is when I was a little girl, and I belong to  old Tuskaya-hiniha. He was big man in de Upper Creek, and we have a  purty good size farm, jest a little bit to de north of de wagon depot  houses on de old road at Honey Springs. Dat place was about  twenty-five mile south of Fort Gibson, but I don't know nothing about  whar de fort is when I was a little girl at dat time. I know de Elk  River 'bout two mile north of whar we live, 'cause I been there many  de time.    I don't know if old Master have a white name. Lots de Upper Creek  didn't have no white name. Maybe he have another Indian name, too,  because Tuskaya-hiniha mean \"head man warrior\" in Creek, but dat what  everybody call him and dat what de family call him too.    My Mistress' name was Nancy, and she was a Lott before she marry old  man Tuskaya-hiniha. Her pappy name was Lott and he was purty near  white. Maybe so all white. Dey have two chillun, I think, but only one  stayed on de place. She was name Luwina, and her husband was dead. His  name was Walker, and Luwina bring Mr. Walker's little sister, Nancy,  to live at de place too.    Luwina had a little baby boy and dat de reason old Master buy me, to  look after de little baby boy. He didn't have no name cause he wasn't  big enough when I was with dem, but he git a name later on, I reckon.  We all call him \"Istidji.\" Dat mean \"little man.\"    When I first remember, before de War, old Master had 'bout as many  slave as I got fingers, I reckon. I can think dem off on my fingers  like dis, but I can't recollect de names.    Dey call all de slaves \"Istilusti.\" Dat mean \"Black man.\"    Old man Tuskaya-hiniha was near 'bout blind before de War, and 'bout  time of de War he go plumb blind and have to set on de long seat under  de bresh shelter of"]]]
