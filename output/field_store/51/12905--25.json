In  like manner, if the tail of a Lion in any other attitude be extended,  there must be a statement to that effect.      [Illustration: No. 177.--Couchant.]      [Illustration: No. 178.--Sejant.]      [Illustration: No. 179.--Dormant.]    _Sejant_: sitting down with his head elevated, No. 178. If he looks out  from the Shield, the word _Guardant_ is to be added. A Scottish Lion  sejant usually has his fore paws raised in the air, and in English terms  of blazon would be described as \"_Sejant erect_\" or \"_Sejant rampant_.\"    _Couchant_: is at rest, the fore legs stretched on the ground, as No.  177.    _Dormant_: asleep, head resting on fore paws, No. 179.    _Salient_: in the act of springing, the hind paws on the ground, both  the fore paws elevated, No. 180.      [Illustration: No. 180.--Salient.]      [Illustration: No. 181.--Double-queued.]      [Illustration: No. 182.--Coward.]    _Queue fourchée_: having a forked tail.    _Double-queued_: two tails, as No. 181, which is a _lion rampant  double-queued_.    _Coward: passant reguardant_, his tail between his legs, No. 182.    Two Lions rampant, when face to face, are _Counter rampant_, or  _Combatant_: when back to back, they are _Addorsed_: when passant or  salient in contrary directions, they are _Counter passant_ or _Counter  salient_.    Lions, whatever their tincture, except it be red, or they are charged on  a field of that tincture, are _armed and langued gules_; but _azure_ in  the case of either of these exceptions, unless the contrary be specified  in the blazon. When several Lions appear in one composition, or when  they are drawn to a comparatively very small scale, they are sometimes  blazoned as \"_Lioncels_.\" This term \"_Lioncel_,\" it must be added, when  used alone, denotes a _small Lion rampant_.      [Illustration: No. 183.--Lion's Head.]      [Illustration: No. 184.--Lion's Face.]      [Illustration: No. 185.--Lion's Jambe.]    A Lion's _head_ is a Charge: it may be _erased_, as in No. 183; or cut  off smooth, when it is _couped_. A Lion's _face_ also is a Charge, No.  184; so is his _jambe_ or _paw_, No. 185. A _demi-lion rampant_ is the  upper half of his body and the extremity of his tufted tail, as in No.  186.      [Illustration: No. 186.--Demi-Lion Rampant.]      [Illustration: No. 187.--England.]    The LIONS OF ENGLAND are _golden Lions leopardé_, three in number,  placed one above the other on a red Shield. They are blazoned--_Gu.,  three Lions pass. guard., in pale, or_, No. 187.    A Lion in this attitude, of this tincture, and on a field gules, may be  blazoned as a \"Lion of England.\" These three Lions _first_ appear upon  the second Great Seal of RICHARD I., A.D. 1194, on the Shield of the  King, No. 188. An earlier Seal, used by Prince JOHN before his brother's  accession, has a Shield charged with _two_ Lions only, and they are  _passant_, No. 189. The first Great Seal of the lion-hearted King has a  Shield, bowed in its contour, and charged with a _single_ Lion rampant  facing to the sinister, or _counter-rampant_, No. 190; and it has been  conjectured that, were the whole face of this Shield visible, a second  Lion rampant facing to the dexter would appear, thus charging the Shield  with _two Lions combattant_; this, however, is a conjecture which is not  supported by the authority of many Shields of the same form. A red  Shield charged with _two golden Lions passant guardant in pale_ (No.  22), and therefore closely resembling No. 189, as I have already shown,  has been assigned to WILLIAM I., and his two sons and his grandson,  WILLIAM II., HENRY I., and STEPHEN. The Shield bearing the three Lions,  No. 187, has been assigned to HENRY II., but it first makes its  appearance on the Great Seal of his son. The probability is that up to  this period the device was simply a lion, indeterminate in position or  numbers. This same Shield has continued, from the time of RICHARD I., to  display the ROYAL ARMS of the REALM OF ENGLAND: how, in the course of  ages, these Arms become grouped with other insignia, I shall presently  have to show.      [Illustration: No. 188.--Richard I.--2nd Gt. Seal.]      [Illustration: No. 190.--Richard I.--1st Gt. Seal.]      [Illustration: No. 189.--Prince John.--Seal.]      [Illustration: No. 191.--Le Strange.]      [Illustration: No. 192.--Giffard.]      [Illustration: No. 193.--Mowbray.]    The _Lion passant_ is carefully distinguished in the earliest Rolls as a  different Charge from the _Lion passant guardant_. Thus (H. 3), for  HAMON LE STRANGE--_Gu., two Lions passant arg._, No. 191; and for JOHN  GIFFARD--_Gu., three Lions pass. arg._, No. 192: for Sir NICHOLAS CAREW  (E. 2),--_Or, three Lions pass. sa._      [Illustration: No. 194.--De Lacy.]      [Illustration: No. 195.--De Segrave.]    From the numerous early Shields which bear _Lions rampant_, I select the  following examples, associated with names illustrious in English  History. For ROGER DE MOWBRAY (H. 3)--_Gu., a Lion rampt. arg._, No.  193: this Coat is quartered by the present Lord MOWBRAY, SEGRAVE and  STOURTON. For FITZ-ALAN, Earl of ARUNDEL--_Gu., a Lion rampt. or_  (H. 3), No. 193. For DE LACI, Earl of LINCOLN--_Or, a Lion rampt.  purpure_ (E. 2), No. 194. For Sir JOHN DE SEGRAVE (E. 2)--_Sa., a Lion  rampt. arg., crowned or_, No. 195. For PERCY, Earl of  NORTHUMBERLAND--_Or, a Lion rampt. az._, No 196: this Shield is drawn  from the fine counter-seal of Sir HENRY DE PERCY, first Lord of Alnwick,  who died A.D. 1315.    Two Shields of the DE BOHUNS, Nos. 114, 115, already described,  exemplify the display of Lioncels as heraldic charges. An earlier  Shield, charged with six Lioncels, but without any Ordinary, was borne  by FAIR ROSAMOND'S son, WILLIAM LONGESPÉE, Earl of SALISBURY, A.D. 1226:  it is boldly sculptured with his noble effigy in Salisbury Cathedral,  and it also appears upon his Seal--_Az., six Lioncels or_, No. 197. The  Roll of Edward II., confirmed by his Seal, gives for Sir WM. DE  LEYBOURNE the same composition, with a difference in the  tincturing--_Az., six Lioncels arg._ Other members of the same family  change these tinctures for _gules and or_, _gules and argent_, and _or  and sable_ (E. 2). Examples of Shields which bear Lions or Lioncels with  various other charges will be described and illustrated in succeeding  chapters.      [Illustration: No. 196.--De Percy.]      [Illustration: No. 197.--Longespée.]    Lions also fulfil important duties of high honour in English Heraldry as  _Crests_ and _Supporters_, and also as _Badges_. From the time of  EDWARD III. a Crowned Lion, at the first standing on a Cap of Estate,  and afterwards upon the Crown, has been the Royal Crest of ENGLAND;  a Lion also has always been the Royal Crest of SCOTLAND (see Chapter  XVIII.). The Princes of the Royal Houses of England, in like manner,  have always borne the Royal Lion distinguished by some \"Mark of Cadency\"  (see Chapter XII.): No. 198 is the Lion Crest of the BLACK PRINCE, from  his Monument at Canterbury, the Lion differenced with the Prince's  silver label. The Lion also appears as the Crest of many noble and  distinguished families, as the DE BOHUNS, the PERCIES, and the HOWARDS.  The Lion Crest of RICHARD II., sculptured _statant guardant_ upon his  helm, with a chapeau and mantling, and with the Badge of two Ostrich  feathers, in Westminster Hall, is without any crown: No. 199.      [Illustration: No. 198.--Crest of Black Prince.]      [Illustration: No. 199.--Crest of Richard II.]    As a Royal Supporter of the Arms of _England_, the Lion appears in  company with some other creature from the time of HENRY VI., EDWARD IV.  sometimes having his Shield supported by two Lions. On the accession of  JAMES I. of Great Britain, the Royal Lion Supporter formed that alliance  with the Unicorn of Scotland which still continues, and will continue,  it is to be hoped, throughout all time. Lions, as I shall point out more  in detail in Chapter XVI., were frequently introduced into the  composition of Seals before true heraldic Supporters were in use. In  more recent Heraldry the Lion is a favourite Supporter: he now appears  supporting the Shields of the Dukes of NORFOLK, ARGYLL, ATHOLL, BEDFORD,  GRAFTON, NORTHUMBERLAND, PORTLAND, and WELLINGTON; also, with many  others, those of the Marquesses of BATH, EXETER, HEADFORT, and  SALISBURY; of the Earls of ALBEMARLE, BROWNLOW, CARLISLE, CARNARVON,  CORK, ESSEX, and HARDWICK; of the Viscount HARDINGE; and of the Barons  ARUNDEL, CAMOYS, DUNBOYNE, MONSON, MOWBRAY, PETRE, and SOUTHAMPTON. As a  Supporter the Lion is represented _rampant_, _rampant reguardant_, and  _sejant rampant_. Lions also, and Demi-Lions, are frequently borne as  modern Crests.    In our own treatment of the Lions of Heraldry, whatever their attitude  or tincture, whatever also the position they may occupy or the heraldic  duty they may discharge, we are always to draw and to blazon them as  true _heraldic Lions_, while, at the same time, in their expression and  general characteristics they are to be _genuine Lions_.    In becoming fellowship with the Lion, the EAGLE appears in the earliest  English Rolls and examples of Arms. The Royal bird, however, does not  occur in English blazon so frequently as the Lion; and his appearance  often denotes an alliance with German Princes. A Roll of Arms (printed  in \"Archæologia,\" XXX.) of the year 1275 commences with the Shields of  the \"EMPEROR OF GERMANY,\" and of the \"KING OF GERMANY,\" which are  severally blazoned as,--\"_Or, an Eagle displayed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2323"],[0,"Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee (#19)"],[1,"pture, except  his detention. I feel assured that he will be well attended to. He will  be in the hands of old army officers and surgeons, most of whom are men  of principle and humanity. His wound, I understand, has not been injured  by his removal, but is doing well. Nothing would do him more harm than  for him to learn that you were sick and sad. How could he get well? So  cheer up and prove your fortitude and patriotism.... You may think of  Fitzhugh and love him as much as you please, but do not grieve over him  or grow sad.\"    From Williamsport, to my mother, he thus writes of his son's capture:    \"I have heard with great grief that Fitzhugh has been captured by the  enemy. Had not expected that he would be taken from his bed and carried  off, but we must bear this additional affliction with fortitude and  resignation, and not repine at the will of God. It will eventuate  in some good that we know not of now. We must bear our labours and  hardships manfully. Our noble men are cheerful and confident. I  constantly remember you in my thoughts and prayers.\"    On July 12th, from near Hagerstown, he writes again about him:    \"The consequences of war are horrid enough at best, surrounded by all  the ameliorations of civilisation and Christianity. I am very sorry for  the injuries done the family at Hickory Hill, and particularly that our  dear old Uncle Williams, in his eightieth year, should be subjected to  such treatment. But we cannot help it, and must endure it. You will,  however, learn before this reaches you that our success at Gettysburg  was not so great as reported--in fact, that we failed to drive the enemy  from his position, and that our army withdrew to the Potomac. Had the  river not unexpectedly risen, all would have been well with us; but God,  in His all-wise providence, willed otherwise, and our communications  have been interrupted and almost cut off. The waters have subsided  to about four feet, and, if they continue, by to-morrow, I hope, our  communications will be open. I trust that a merciful God, our only hope  and refuge, will not desert us in this hour of need, and will deliver us  by His almighty hand, that the whole world may recognise His power  and all hearts be lifted up in adoration and praise of His unbounded  loving-kindness. We must, however, submit to His almighty will, whatever  that may be. May God guide and protect us all is my constant prayer.\"    In 1868, in a letter to Major Wm. M. McDonald, of Berryville, Clarke  County, Virginia, who was intending to write a school history, and had  written to my father, asking for information about some of his great  battles, the following statement appears:    \"As to the battle of Gettysburg, I must again refer you to the official  accounts. Its loss was occasioned by a combination of circumstances. It  was commenced in the absence of correct intelligence. It was continued  in the effort to overcome the difficulties by which we were surrounded,  and it would have been gained could one determined and united blow have  been delivered by our whole line. As it was, victory trembled in the  balance for three days, and the battle resulted in the infliction of as  great an amount of injury as was received and in frustrating the Federal  campaign for the season.\"    After my brother's capture I went to Richmond, taking with me his horses  and servants. After remaining there a short time, I mounted my mare and  started back to the army, which I found at its old camping-ground in  Culpeper. I stopped at first for a few days with my father. He was very  glad to see me and the could tell him all about my mother and sisters,  and many other friends whom I had just left in Richmond. He appeared  to be unchanged in manner and appearance. The disappointment in the  Gettysburg campaign, to which he alludes in his letter to my mother,  was not shown in anything he said or did. He was calm and dignified with  all, at times bright and cheerful, and always had a pleasant word  for those about him. The army lay inactive, along the line of the  Rappahannock and the Rapidan for two months, watching the enemy, who was  in our front. We were very anxious to attack or to be attacked, but each  general desired to fight on ground of his won choosing.    During this period, and indeed at all times, my father was fully  employed. Besides the care of his own immediate command, he advised with  the President and Secretary of War as to the movements and dispositions  of the other armies in the Confederacy. In looking over his  correspondence one is astonished a the amount of it and at its varied  character. He always answered all letters addressed to him, from  whatever source, if it was possible. During this winter he devoted  himself especially to looking after the welfare of his troops, their  clothing, shoes, and rations, all three of which were becoming very  scarce. Often, indeed, his army had only a few days' rations in sight.  Here are some letters written to the authorities, showing how he  was hampered in his movements by the deficiencies existing  in the quartermaster's and commissary departments. To the  Quartermaster-General, at Richmond, he writes, October, 1863, after his  movement around General Meade's right, to Manassas:    \"...The want of supplies of shoes, clothing and blankets is very great.  Nothing but my unwillingness to expose the men to the hardships that  would have resulted from moving them into Loudoun in their present  condition induced me to return to the Rappahannock. But I was averse to  marching them over the rough roads of that region, at a season, too when  frosts are certain and snow probable, unless they were better  provided to encounter them without suffering. I should, otherwise have  endeavoured to detain General Meade near the Potomac, if I could not  throw him to the north side.\"    In a letter of the same time to the Honourable James A. Seddon,  Secretary of War:    \"...If General Meade is disposed to remain quiet where he is, it was my  intention, provided the army could be supplied with clothing, again to  advance and threaten his position. Nothing prevented my continuing in  his front but the destitute condition of the men, thousands of whom  are barefooted, a greater number partially shod, and nearly all without  overcoats, blankets, or warm clothing. I think the sublimest sight of  war was the cheerfulness and alacrity exhibited by this army in the  pursuit of the enemy under all the trial and privations to which it was  exposed....\"    Later on, in January, when the sever weather commenced, he again writes  to the Quartermaster-General on the same subject:    \"General: The want of shoes and blankets in this army continues to  cause much suffering and to impair its efficiency. In one regiment I  am informed that there are only fifty men with serviceable shoes, and  a brigade that recently went on picket was compelled to leave several  hundred men in camp, who were unable to bear the exposure of duty, being  destitute of shoes and blankets.... The supply, by running the blockade,  has become so precarious that I think we should turn our attention  chiefly to our own resources, and I should like to be informed how  far the latter can be counted upon.... I trust that no efforts will be  spared to develop our own resources of supply, as a further dependence  upon those from abroad can result in nothing but increase of suffering  and want. I am, with great respect,    \"Your obedient servant,    \"R. E. Lee, General.\"    There was at this time a great revival of religion in the army. My  father became much interested in it, and did what he could to promote in  his camps all sacred exercises. Reverend J. W. Jones, in his \"Personal  Reminiscences of General R. E. Lee,\" says:    \"General Lee's orders and reports always gratefully recognised 'The Lord  of Hosts' as the 'Giver of Victory,' and expressed an humble dependence  upon and trust in Him.'\"    All his correspondence shows the same devout feeling.    On August 13, 1863, he issued the following order:    \"Headquarters, Army Northern Virginia, August 13, 1863.    \"The President of the Confederate States has, in the name of the people,  appointed August 21st as a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer. A  strict observance of the day is enjoined upon the officers and soldiers  of this army. All military duties, except such as are absolutely  necessary, will be suspended. The commanding officers of brigades  and regiments are requested to cause divine services, suitable to the  occasion, to be performed in their respective commands. Soldiers! we  have sinned against Almighty God. We have forgotten His signal mercies,  and have cultivated a revengeful, haughty, and boastful spirit. We have  not remembered that the defenders of a just cause should be pure in His  eyes; that 'our times are in His hands,' and we have relied too much on  our own arms for the achievement of our independence. God is our only  refuge and our strength. Let us humble ourselves before Him. Let us  confess our many sins, and beseech Him to give us a higher courage, a  purer patriotism, and more determined will; that He will hasten the time  when war, with its sorrows and sufferings, shall cease, and that He will  give us a name and place among the nations of the earth.    \"R. E. Lee, General.\"    His was a practical, every-day religion, which supported him all through  his life, enabled him to bear with equanimity every reverse of fortune,  and to accept her gifts without undue elation. During this period of  rest, so unusual to the Army of Northern Virginia, several reviews were  held before the commanding general. I remember being present when that  of the Third Army Corps, General A. P. Hill commanding, took place. Some  of us young cavalrymen, then stationed near the Rappahannock, rode over  to Orange Court House to see this grand military pageant. From all parts  of the army, officers"]]]
