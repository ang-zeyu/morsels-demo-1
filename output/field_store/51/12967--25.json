Plato, Spinoza, and Hegel may  be taken as typical of the philosophers whose interests are mainly  religious and ethical, while Leibniz, Locke, and Hume may be taken as  representatives of the scientific wing. In Aristotle, Descartes,  Berkeley, and Kant we find both groups of motives strongly present.    Herbert Spencer, in whose honour we are assembled to-day, would  naturally be classed among scientific philosophers: it was mainly from  science that he drew his data, his formulation of problems, and his  conception of method. But his strong religious sense is obvious in  much of his writing, and his ethical pre-occupations are what make him  value the conception of evolution--that conception in which, as a  whole generation has believed, science and morals are to be united in  fruitful and indissoluble marriage.    It is my belief that the ethical and religious motives in spite of  the splendidly imaginative systems to which they have given rise, have  been on the whole a hindrance to the progress of philosophy, and ought  now to be consciously thrust aside by those who wish to discover  philosophical truth. Science, originally, was entangled in similar  motives, and was thereby hindered in its advances. It is, I maintain,  from science, rather than from ethics and religion, that philosophy  should draw its inspiration.    But there are two different ways in which a philosophy may seek to  base itself upon science. It may emphasise the most general _results_  of science, and seek to give even greater generality and unity to  these results. Or it may study the _methods_ of science, and seek to  apply these methods, with the necessary adaptations, to its own  peculiar province. Much philosophy inspired by science has gone astray  through preoccupation with the _results_ momentarily supposed to have  been achieved. It is not results, but _methods_ that can be  transferred with profit from the sphere of the special sciences to the  sphere of philosophy. What I wish to bring to your notice is the  possibility and importance of applying to philosophical problems  certain broad principles of method which have been found successful in  the study of scientific questions.    The opposition between a philosophy guided by scientific method and a  philosophy dominated by religious and ethical ideas may be illustrated  by two notions which are very prevalent in the works of philosophers,  namely the notion of _the universe_, and the notion of _good and  evil_. A philosopher is expected to tell us something about the nature  of the universe as a whole, and to give grounds for either optimism or  pessimism. Both these expectations seem to me mistaken. I believe the  conception of \"the universe\" to be, as its etymology indicates, a  mere relic of pre-Copernican astronomy: and I believe the question of  optimism and pessimism to be one which the philosopher will regard as  outside his scope, except, possibly, to the extent of maintaining that  it is insoluble.    In the days before Copernicus, the conception of the \"universe\" was  defensible on scientific grounds: the diurnal revolution of the  heavenly bodies bound them together as all parts of one system, of  which the earth was the centre. Round this apparent scientific fact,  many human desires rallied: the wish to believe Man important in the  scheme of things, the theoretical desire for a comprehensive  understanding of the Whole, the hope that the course of nature might  be guided by some sympathy with our wishes. In this way, an ethically  inspired system of metaphysics grew up, whose anthropocentrism was  apparently warranted by the geocentrism of astronomy. When Copernicus  swept away the astronomical basis of this system of thought, it had  grown so familiar, and had associated itself so intimately with men's  aspirations, that it survived with scarcely diminished force--survived  even Kant's \"Copernican revolution,\" and is still now the unconscious  premiss of most metaphysical systems.    The oneness of the world is an almost undiscussed postulate of most  metaphysics. \"Reality is not merely one and self-consistent, but is a  system of reciprocally determinate parts\"[19]--such a statement would  pass almost unnoticed as a mere truism. Yet I believe that it embodies  a failure to effect thoroughly the \"Copernican revolution,\" and that  the apparent oneness of the world is merely the oneness of what is  seen by a single spectator or apprehended by a single mind. The  Critical Philosophy, although it intended to emphasise the subjective  element in many apparent characteristics of the world, yet, by  regarding the world in itself as unknowable, so concentrated attention  upon the subjective representation that its subjectivity was soon  forgotten. Having recognised the categories as the work of the mind,  it was paralysed by its own recognition, and abandoned in despair the  attempt to undo the work of subjective falsification. In part, no  doubt, its despair was well founded, but not, I think, in any absolute  or ultimate sense. Still less was it a ground for rejoicing, or for  supposing that the nescience to which it ought to have given rise  could be legitimately exchanged for a metaphysical dogmatism.      I    As regards our present question, namely, the question of the unity of  the world, the right method, as I think, has been indicated by William  James.[20] \"Let us now turn our backs upon ineffable or unintelligible  ways of accounting for the world's oneness, and inquire whether,  instead of being a principle, the 'oneness' affirmed may not merely be  a name like 'substance' descriptive of the fact that certain _specific  and verifiable connections_ are found among the parts of the  experiential flux.... We can easily conceive of things that shall have  no connection whatever with each other. We may assume them to inhabit  different times and spaces, as the dreams of different persons do even  now. They may be so unlike and incommensurable, and so inert towards  one another, as never to jostle or interfere. Even now there may  actually be whole universes so disparate from ours that we who know  ours have no means of perceiving that they exist. We conceive their  diversity, however; and by that fact the whole lot of them form what  is known in logic as 'a universe of discourse.' To form a universe of  discourse argues, as this example shows, no further kind of connexion.  The importance attached by certain monistic writers to the fact that  any chaos may become a universe by merely being named, is to me  incomprehensible.\" We are thus left with two kinds of unity in the  experienced world; the one what we may call the epistemological unity,  due merely to the fact that my experienced world is what _one_  experience selects from the sum total of existence: the other that  tentative and partial unity exhibited in the prevalence of scientific  laws in those portions of the world which science has hitherto  mastered. Now a generalisation based upon either of these kinds of  unity would be fallacious. That the things which we experience have  the common property of being experienced by us is a truism from which  obviously nothing of importance can be deducible: it is clearly  fallacious to draw from the fact that whatever we experience is  experienced the conclusion that therefore everything must be  experienced. The generalisation of the second kind of unity, namely,  that derived from scientific laws, would be equally fallacious, though  the fallacy is a trifle less elementary. In order to explain it let us  consider for a moment what is called the reign of law. People often  speak as though it were a remarkable fact that the physical world is  subject to invariable laws. In fact, however, it is not easy to see  how such a world could fail to obey general laws. Taking any arbitrary  set of points in space, there is a function of the time corresponding  to these points, i.e. expressing the motion of a particle which  traverses these points: this function may be regarded as a general law  to which the behaviour of such a particle is subject. Taking all such  functions for all the particles in the universe, there will be  theoretically some one formula embracing them all, and this formula  may be regarded as the single and supreme law of the spatio-temporal  world. Thus what is surprising in physics is not the existence of  general laws, but their extreme simplicity. It is not the uniformity  of nature that should surprise us, for, by sufficient analytic  ingenuity, any conceivable course of nature might be shown to exhibit  uniformity. What should surprise us is the fact that the uniformity is  simple enough for us to be able to discover it. But it is just this  characteristic of simplicity in the laws of nature hitherto discovered  which it would be fallacious to generalise, for it is obvious that  simplicity has been a part cause of their discovery, and can,  therefore, give no ground for the supposition that other undiscovered  laws are equally simple.    The fallacies to which these two kinds of unity have given rise  suggest a caution as regards all use in philosophy of general  _results_ that science is supposed to have achieved. In the first  place, in generalising these results beyond past experience, it is  necessary to examine very carefully whether there is not some reason  making it more probable that these results should hold of all that has  been experienced than that they should hold of things universally. The  sum total of what is experienced by mankind is a selection from the  sum total of what exists, and any general character exhibited by this  selection may be due to the manner of selecting rather than to the  general character of that from which experience selects. In the second  place, the most general results of science are the least certain and  the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#19)"],[1,"in those.\"    \"Yes, I hope I shall,\" said Ben; \"but I'm a bit scared, sir.\"    \"What! about the danger of opening the keg?\"    \"Tchah! no, sir.  I can open that safely enough.  It only means  loosening the two hoops at the end, and then the heading will slip out.  I mean this--the barrels have been down there no one knows how long, and  what I want to know is, will it be powder after all?\"    \"Not powder after all!\" cried Roy in astonishment, as his active mind  began to question what liquor it could be there that was stored up so  carefully as if it were a treasure indeed.    \"I'm afraid it won't be, sir--very much afraid.\"    \"Then what do you think it is?\"    \"Solid blocks o' stony stuff, sir, I should say.\"    \"But they don't put stony stuff in kegs like these.\"    \"No, sir, powder; but perhaps it has got damp with time and hardened so  as it won't be of any use.\"    \"Not if it's dried and ground up again.\"    \"Don't know, sir; can't say; but we'll soon see.\"  There was no  hesitation shown.  Ben tapped the two top hoops a little, and they soon  grew loose and were worked up the staves; the top one withdrawn, and the  next brought up into its place, having the wooden disc which formed the  head free to be lifted out.    \"I thought so, sir,\" said Ben with a sigh, as he looked in.  \"Just solid  black, and nothing else.\"    He thumped the top of the contents with his knuckles, and then tapping  the lower hoops they glided down and the staves fell apart, leaving a  black block standing upon the table.    \"Oh, this is bad luck, sir! horribly bad luck!\" groaned Ben.  \"We shall  have to get some powder from somewhere, Plymouth or--yes, Bristol's the  most likely place.\"    \"Fetch out the other keg, and open that, Ben,\" said Roy.  \"To be sure,  sir,\" said Ben, and he turned to the closet and bore the second keg to  the table.  \"If this is all right,\" he went on, \"there's some hope for  us, because we may find some more; but if it has gone bad from both  sides it's all over with us: we can only stand well on the towers and  throw stones down at whoever comes.\"    Ben's fingers were as busy as his tongue, and in a few minutes he had  the head out of the second keg, looked in, and tapped it with his  knuckles.    \"Just the same, sir, just the same.\"    \"Look here, Ben!  I'll have one of these blocks chopped up, and then  ground up fine, and we'll try it with a musket.\"    \"Good, sir! that's the right thing to do; but after being wet once, I'm  afraid it'll fizz off now like a firework.\"    \"You don't know till you've tried, man.  Now, let's see: get an axe,  sergeant.\"    \"If I might ask your pardon, captain, axes aren't the proper thing to  break up a block of gunpowder.  I should say a beetle or a mall was the  thing.\"    \"Well, get a mallet, then,\" said Roy; and the old man went to his tools  used for repairing the armour, carpentering, or any other odd jobs, and  brought out a mallet, with which he was about to strike a tremendous  blow in the middle of the block, when Roy checked him.    \"No, no!\" he cried; \"give it to me.  I'll knock a piece off the top  edge.\"    Ben handed the mallet respectfully enough, but he shook his head as if  he did not consider that handling mallets was correct for the castellan  of the place; while raising the implement not without some shade of  doubt as to whether an explosion might follow the blow, but reassuring  himself as he remembered that the mallet was only wood, Roy brought it  down on the top with a sharp rap, and then started back in dismay, for a  piece like a fragment of black potsherd fell upon the table with a bang,  and a stream of fine grains came flowing out of the great hole he had  made, covering the hardened piece and running on like black sand.    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Ben, excitedly; \"they're all right, sir.  Just formed  a cake outside, and the inside's all safe and good.  Twelve good brass  guns, and plenty of powder.  We're ready for all the enemies the king  has got in this part of the world.  Now we'll see for a couple of  cartridges for the guns.\"    He fetched a couple of small bags, which he filled with the powder, and  then, after putting back the unbroken keg-shaped block, as carefully  cleared all the loose powder from the table, and placed that and the  shape from which it had come in the oak closet, which he locked.    \"Powder's powder, sir; so one has to take care,\" he said.  \"Now for a  touch port-fire, and we'll try what sort of stuff it is.\"    Ben gave Roy a knowing look, and then from a drawer in the table he took  a piece of prepared oakum such as was used for lowering into the pan of  a freshly primed gun, stepped to a case in which were some old rammers,  and declared himself ready to start, but hesitated and went to his  tool-drawer again, out of which he routed a long thin spike.    \"Now I think we're ready, sir,\" he said, and they went out to where the  men were waiting, and prepared to load the two guns under the gate  tower.    \"These are only makeshifts,\" said Ben, apologetically, as he indicated  his rough cartridges; \"but they'll do to clear out the guns,\" and he set  them down in the door-way leading into the old guard-room.    Then the long thin pin was tried in the touch-holes of both guns, and  after a good deal of poking and drilling the orifices were cleared.  Meanwhile, one of the troopers took the rammer Ben had brought out,  inserted it at the muzzle, and found that it would only go in half-way.  So a ragged stick was fetched, run in, twisted round and round, and  withdrawn, dragging after it a wad of horsehair, cotton, hay, and  feathers, while a succession of trials brought out more and more, the  twisting round having a cleansing effect upon the bore of the gun as  well.    \"Ah!\" said Ben, solemnly, \"them tomtits have had the guns all to  themselves for a fine time.  I shall have to make some tompions to keep  them out.\"    Quite a heap of nest-building material was drawn out of the two guns,  the first obtained being evidently of that season, while farther in it  was old and decayed to a mere mouldy powder that might have been carried  in by the industrious little birds a score of years before.    At last all was declared clear.  The bags of powder were thrust in, a  wad of the cleanest hay from the heap followed, and one of the troopers  rammed the charges home, with the result that the powder rose well in  the touch-holes, and nothing remained to be done but to insert the  lightly twisted pieces of touch-string and apply a light.    \"Better way than doing it with a red-hot poker, as some of us might like  to stand back till the guns are proved,\" said the old soldier, grimly.  \"One of you take that there to the kitchen and get a light,\" he said,  \"to do for a port-fire.\"    He handed a piece of the prepared oakum to one of the men, who ran off  with it, and directly after Roy stepped back quickly and hurried into  the house.    Ben said nothing, but he glanced after the boy with a fierce look,  pursing up his lips, and then muttering to himself, his expression  indicating the most profound disgust.    Meanwhile, Roy ran into the private apartments of the castle, and made  his way to the library; but Lady Royland was not there.    Uttering an ejaculation full of impatience, the boy hurried into the  withdrawing-room, where he had better fortune, for he found his mother  waiting there as if she expected him.    \"You, my dear?\" she said.  \"I was waiting here to see Master Pawson; he  sent me a message to ask if I would see him on matters of importance.  Do you know what he wishes to say?\"    \"Well, I almost think I do, mother,\" replied the boy.    \"Then you have come to meet him?\"    \"No,\" said the boy; \"I didn't know he had sent.  I came to warn you not  to be alarmed, for we are just going to fire.\"    _Boom_!    A report like thunder made the casements rattle as if they were being  dashed in.  This was followed by an echoing roar, and then came a  yelling cry as of some one in agony.    \"Oh, my boy, what has happened?\" cried Lady Royland, starting from her  chair, clapping her hands to her ears, and then sinking back palpitating  in the nearest chair.  \"Run and see; something terrible must have  occurred.\"    Roy had already dashed to the door, and he ran out and along to the  great gate-way, where his mother's words seemed to be verified, for, on  reaching the spot where the gun which had been fired had run back a  short distance, there was the knot of men half hidden by the smoke that  was slowly rising, and in front of them, just below the portcullis, lay,  apparently lifeless, the figure of Master Pawson, face downward upon the  flags.    \"What have you done, Ben?\" cried the boy.    \"Done?  I never done it,\" growled the man, fiercely.  \"You runned away;  so I put the light to the gun myself, and then we all stood and waited,  till all at wunst Master Pawson comes round the corner like.  I dunno  how he come there; and off goes the gun and down goes he.\"    Roy was already upon one knee, turning the secretary over on his back  and examining him for the terrible injury he felt must have been  received.  But as Roy was proceeding to open his collar, he opened his  eyes, sprang up into a sitting position, and then began to abuse the boy  fiercely.    \"You did it on purpose,\" he cried; \"and it's a mercy it did not kill  me.\"    \"Then you are not killed?\" said Roy, dryly.    \"No; but I might have been.  It was a cowardly thing to do.\"    \"Ay, it were, Master Roy!\" whispered Ben, turning upon him.  \"I thought  you'd ha' had heart enough to ha' stood by us.\"    \"What do you mean?\" cried Roy, rising angrily.    \"Oh, you know, sir; sets such a bad example to the men.\"    \"I don't understand you; nor you neither, Master Pawson.\"    \"It's disgraceful; and Lady Royland shall put a stop to such monkey  tricks.\"    \"Powder-monkey tricks,\" growled Ben.    \"Why, you don't think I fired that gun on purpose, sir?\"    \"No, I don't"]]]
