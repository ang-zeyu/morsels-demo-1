[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#19)"],[1," bees retain the female  captive in their cells, after the period for transformation has elapsed;  it is, that they may be able to fly the instant they are hatched. The  new queen occupied all our attention. When she approached the other  royal cells, the bees on guard pulled, bit her, and chased her away;  they seemed to be greatly irritated against her, and she enjoyed  tranquillity only when at a good distance from these cells. This  procedure was frequently repeated through the day. She twice emitted the  sound; in doing so she stood, her thorax against a comb, and the wings  crossed on her back; they were in motion but without being unfolded or  further opened. Whatever might be the cause of her assuming this  attitude, the bees were affected by it; all hung down their heads, and  remained motionless.    The hive presented the same appearances on the following day.  Twenty-three royal cells yet remained, assiduously guarded by a great  many bees. When the queen approached, all the guards became agitated,  surrounded her on all sides, bit, and commonly drove her away; sometimes  when in these circumstances, she emitted her sound, assuming the  position just described, from that moment the bees became motionless.    The queen confined in the second cell had not yet left it, and was heard  to hum several times. We accidentally discovered how the bees fed her.  On attentive examination, a small aperture was perceptible in the end of  the coccoon which she had cut to escape, and which her guards had again  covered with wax, to confine her still longer. She thrust her trunk  through the cleft; at first the bees did not observe it alternately  thrust out and drawn in, but one at length perceiving it, came to apply  its trunk to that of the captive queen, and then gave way to others that  also approached her with honey. When satisfied she retracted her trunk,  and the bees again closed up the opening with wax.    The queen this day between twelve and one became extremely agitated. The  royal cells had multiplied very much; she could go no where without  meeting them, and on approaching she was very roughly treated. Then she  fled, but to obtain no better reception. At last, these things agitated  the bees; they precipitately rushed through the outlets of the hive, and  settled on a tree in the garden. It singularly happened that the queen  was herself unable to follow or conduct the swarm. She had attempted to  pass between two royal cells before they were abandoned by the bees  guarding them, and she was so confined and maltreated as to be incapable  of moving. We then removed her into a separate hive prepared for a  particular experiment; the bees, which had clustered on a branch, soon  discovered their queen was not present, and returned of their own accord  to the hive. Such is an account of the second colony of this hive.    We were extremely solicitous to ascertain what would become of the other  royal cells. Four of the close ones had attained complete maturity, and  the queens would have left them had not the bees prevented it. They were  not open either previous to the agitation of the swarms, or at the  moment of swarming.    None of the queens were at liberty on the eleventh. The second should  have transformed on the eighth; thus she had been three days confined, a  longer period than the first which formed the swarm. We could not  discover what occasioned the difference in their captivity.    On the twelfth, the queen was at last liberated, as we found her in the  hive. She had been treated exactly as her predecessor; the bees allowed  her to rest in quiet, when distant from the royal cells, but tormented  her cruelly when she approached them. We watched this queen a long time,  but not aware that she would lead out a colony, we left the hive for a  few hours. Returning at mid-day, we were greatly surprised to find it  almost totally deserted. During our absence, it had thrown a prodigious  swarm, which still clustered on the branch of a neighbouring tree. We  also saw with astonishment the third cell open, and its top connected to  it as by a hinge. In all probability the captive queen, profiting by the  confusion that preceded the swarming, escaped. Thus, there was no doubt  of both queens being in the swarm. We found it so; and removed them,  that the bees might return to the hive, which they did very soon.    While we were occupied in this operation, the fourth captive queen left  her prison, and the bees found her on returning. At first they were very  much agitated, but calmed towards the evening, and resumed their wonted  labours. They formed a strict guard around the royal cells, and took  great care to remove the queen whenever she attempted to approach.  Eighteen royal cells now remained to be guarded.    The fifth queen left her cell at ten at night; therefore two queens were  now in the hive. They immediately began fighting, but came to disengage  themselves from each other. However they fought several times during the  night without any thing decisive. Next day, the thirteenth, we witnessed  the death of one, which fell by the wounds of her enemy. This duel was  quite similar to what is said of the combats of queens.    The victorious queen now presented a very singular spectacle. She  approached a royal cell, and took this moment to utter the sound, and  assume that posture, which strikes the bees motionless. For some  minutes, we conceived, that taking advantage of the dread exhibited by  the workers on guard, she would open it, and destroy the young female;  also she prepared to mount the cell; but in doing so she ceased the  sound, and quitted that attitude which paralyses the bees. The guardians  of the cell instantly took courage; and, by means of tormenting and  biting the queen, drove her away.    On the fourteenth, the sixth young queen appeared, and the hive threw a  swarm, with all the concomitant disorder before described. The agitation  was so considerable, that a sufficient number of bees did not remain to  guard the royal cells, and several of the imprisoned queens were thus  enabled to make their escape. Three were in the cluster formed by the  swarm, and other three remained in the hive. We removed those that had  led the colony, to force the bees to return. They entered the hive,  resumed their post around the royal cells, and maltreated the queens  when approaching.    A duel took place in the night of the fifteenth, in which one queen  fell. We found her dead next morning before the hive; but three still  remained, as one had been hatched during night. Next morning we saw a  duel. Both combatants were extremely agitated, either with the desire of  fighting, or the treatment of the bees, when they came near the royal  cells. Their agitation quickly communicated to the rest of the bees, and  at mid-day they departed impetuously with the two females. This was the  fifth swarm that had left the hive between the thirtieth of May and  fifteenth of June. On the sixteenth, a sixth swarm cast, which I shall  give you no account of, as it shewed nothing new.    Unfortunately we lost this, which was a very strong swarm; the bees flew  out of sight, and could never be found. The hive was now very thinly  inhabited. Only the few bees that had not participated in the general  agitation remained, and those that returned from the fields after the  swarm had departed. The cells were, therefore, slenderly guarded; the  queens escaped from them, and engaged in several combats, until the  throne remained with the most successful.    Notwithstanding the victories of this queen, she was treated with great  indifference from the sixteenth to the nineteenth, that is, the three  days that she preserved her virginity. At length, having gone to seek  the males, she returned with all the external signs of fecundation, and  was henceforth received with every mark of respect; she laid her first  eggs forty-six hours after fecundation.    Behold, Sir, a simple and faithful account of my observations on the  formation of swarms. That the narrative might be the more connected, I  have avoided interrupting it by the detail of several particular  experiments which I made at the same time for elucidating various  obscure points of their history. These shall be the subject of future  letters. For, although I have said so much, I hope still to interest  you.      _PREGNY, 6. September 1791._    _P. S._--In revising this letter, I find I have neglected taking notice  of an objection that may embarrass my readers, and which ought to be  answered.    After the first five swarms had thrown, I had always returned the bees  to the hive: it is not surprising, therefore, that it was continually so  sufficiently stocked that each colony was numerous. But things are  otherwise in the natural state: the bees composing a swarm do not return  to the hive; and it will undoubtedly be asked, What resource enables a  common hive to swarm three or four times without being too much  weakened?    I cannot lessen the difficulty. I have observed that the agitation,  which precedes the swarming, is often so considerable, that most of the  bees quit the hive, and in that case we cannot well comprehend how, in  three or four days afterwards, it can be in a state to send out another  colony equally strong.    But remark, in the first place, that the queen leaves a prodigious  quantity of workers' brood, which soon transforms to bees; and in this  way the population sometimes becomes almost as great after swarming as  before it.    Thus the hive is perfectly capable of affording a second colony without  being too much weakened. The third and fourth swarm weaken it more  sensibly; but the inhabitants always remain in sufficient numbers to  preserve the course of their labours uninterrupted; and the losses are  soon repaired by the great fecundity of the queen, as she lays above an  hundred eggs a day.

[93] In _Italy_, the Courts of _Palma_, _Modena_, _Turin_, &c. and in  _Germany_, the Courts of _Vienna_, _Bavaria_, _Hanover_, _Brandenbourg_,  _Palatine_, _Saxony_, &c.    [94] There have been such, who valued themselves for shaking a Room,  breaking the Windows, and stunning the Auditors with their Voice.    [95] The renowned Abbot _Steffani_, so famous for his _Duetto's_, would  never suffer such luxuriant Singers to perform any of them, unless they  kept themselves within Bounds.    [96] _Nicolini_, who came the first time into _England_ about the Year  1708, had both Qualities, more than any that have come since. He acted  to Perfection, and did not sing much inferior. His Variations in the  _Airs_ were excellent; but in his _Cadences_ he had a little of the  antiquated Tricks. _Valentini_, (who was here at the same Time) a  Scholar of _Pistochi_, though not so powerful in Voice or Action as  _Nicolini_, was more chaste in his Singing.    [97] The two Women, he points at, are _Cuzzoni_ and _Faustina_.    [98] The _Carnaval_ is a Festival in _Italy_, particularly celebrated at  _Venice_ from _Christmas_ to _Lent_, when all Sorts of Diversions are  permitted; and at that Time there are sometimes three different Theatres  for Opera's only.    [99] Our Author has often mentioned Time; the Regard to it, the  Strictness of it, and how much it is neglected and unobserv'd. In this  Place speaking of stealing the Time, it regards particularly the Vocal,  or the Performance on a single Instrument in the _Pathetick_ and  _Tender_; when the Bass goes an exactly regular Pace, the other Part  retards or anticipates in a singular Manner, for the Sake of Expression,  but after That returns to its Exactness, to be guided by the Bass.  Experience and Taste must teach it. A mechanical Method of going on with  the Bass will easily distinguish the Merit of the other Manner.    [100] A farther Animadversion against imitating Instruments with the  Voice.    [101] Many Graces may be very good and proper for a Violin, that would  be very improper for a Hautboy; and so with every Species of Instruments  that have something peculiar. It is a very great Error (too much in  Practice) for the Voice, (which should serve as a Standard to be  imitated by Instruments,) to copy all the Tricks practised on the  several Instruments, to its greatest Detriment.    [102] _Passo_ and _Passagio_. The Difference is, that a _Passo_ is a  sudden Grace or Flight, not uniform. See Pl. VI. Numb. 5. A _Passagio_  is a Division, a Continuation, or a Succession of Notes, ascending or  descending with Uniformity. See Pl. VI. Numb. 6.    [103] This alludes to the _French_ Manner of Singing, from whence that  Defect is copy'd.    [104] The Time he alludes to, is at present between thirty and forty  Years ago.    [105] Compare this Section with Section 41 in this Chapter and the Note.    [106] This is a Fault more than once heard of, in _Oratario's_ or  _Motetts_.    [107] See Example, Pl. VI. Numb. 7.    [108] _Faustina_ and _Cuzzoni_, they both having within these few Years  been in _England_, there needs no other Remark to be made on them, but  to inform Futurity, that the _English_ Audience distinguish'd them Both  and at the same time, according to their Merit, and as our Author has  describ'd them.    It may be worth remarking, that _Castilione_, who lived above two  hundred Years ago, in his _Cortegiano_, describes _Bidon_, and  _Marchetto Cara_, two famous Singers in his Time, with the same  distinguishing Qualifications.    [109] See Examples, Pl. VI. Numb. 8 and 9."]]]
