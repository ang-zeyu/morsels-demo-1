Laying  his hand on his friend's shoulder, he continued: \"I cannot say how  hard it is for me to refuse Clara this trip. Haven't I promised it to  her and hasn't she looked forward to it for months? She has borne all  her suffering so patiently, just because she had hoped to be able to  visit her little friend on the Alp. I hate to rob her of this  pleasure. The poor child has so many trials and so little change.\"    \"But, Sesemann, you must do it,\" was the doctor's answer. When his  friend remained silent, he continued: \"Just think what a hard summer  Clara has had! She never was more ill and we could not attempt this  journey without risking the worst consequences. Remember, we are in  September now, and though the weather may still be fine on the Alp, it  is sure to be very cool. The days are getting short, and she could  only spend a few hours up there, if she had to return for the night.  It would take several hours to have her carried up from Ragatz. You  see yourself how impossible it is! I shall come in with you, though,  to talk to Clara, and you'll find her sensible. I'll tell you of my  plan for next May. First she can go to Ragatz to take the baths. When  it gets warm on the mountain, she can be carried up from time to time.  She'll be stronger then and much more able to enjoy those excursions  than she is now. If we hope for an improvement in her condition, we  must be extremely cautious and careful, remember that!\"    Mr. Sesemann, who had been listening with the utmost submission, now  said anxiously: \"Doctor, please tell me honestly if you still have  hope left for any change?\"    With shrugging shoulders the doctor replied: \"Not very much. But think  of me, Sesemann! Have you not a child, who loves you and always  welcomes you? You don't have to come back to a lonely house and sit  down alone at your table. Your child is well taken care of, and if she  has many privations, she also has many advantages. Sesemann, you do  not need to be pitied! Just think of my lonely home!\"    Mr. Sesemann had gotten up and was walking round the room, as he  always did when something occupied his thoughts. Suddenly he stood  before his friend and said: \"Doctor, I have an idea. I cannot see you  sad any longer. You must get away. You shall undertake this trip and  visit Heidi in our stead.\"    The doctor had been surprised by this proposal, and tried to object.  But Mr. Sesemann was so full of his new project that he pulled his  friend with him into his daughter's room, not leaving him time for any  remonstrances. Clara loved the doctor, who had always tried to cheer  her up on his visits by bright and funny tales. She was sorry for the  change that had come over him and would have given much to see him  happy again. When he had shaken hands with her, both men pulled up  their chairs to Clara's bedside. Mr. Sesemann began to speak of their  journey and how sorry he was to give it up. Then he quickly began to  talk of his new plan.    Clara's eyes had filled with tears. But she knew that her father did  not like to see her cry, and besides she was sure that her papa would  only forbid her this pleasure because it was absolutely necessary to  do so.    So she bravely fought her tears, and caressing the doctor's hand,  said:    \"Oh please, doctor, do go to Heidi; then you can tell me all about  her, and can describe her grandfather to me, and Peter, with his  goats,--I seem to know them all so well. Then you can take all the  things to her that I had planned to take myself. Oh, please doctor,  go, and then I'll be good and take as much cod-liver oil as ever you  want me to.\"    Who can tell if this promise decided the doctor? At any rate he  answered with a smile: \"Then I surely must go, Clara, for you will get  fat and strong, as we both want to see you. Have you settled yet when  I must go?\"    \"Oh, you had better go tomorrow morning, doctor,\" Clara urged.    \"She is right,\" the father assented; \"the sun is shining and you must  not lose any more glorious days on the Alp.\"    The doctor had to laugh. \"Why don't you chide me for being here still?  I shall go as quickly as I can, Sesemann.\"    Clara gave many messages to him for Heidi. She also told him to be  sure to observe everything closely, so that he would be able to tell  her all about it when he came back. The things for Heidi were to be  sent to him later, for Miss Rottenmeier, who had to pack them, was out  on one of her lengthy wanderings about town.    The doctor promised to comply with all Clara's wishes and to start the  following day.    Clara rang for the maid and said to her, when she arrived: \"Please,  Tinette, pack a lot of fresh, soft coffee-cake in this box.\" A box  had been ready for this purpose many days. When the maid was leaving  the room she murmured: \"That's a silly bother!\"    Sebastian, who had happened to overhear some remarks, asked the  physician when he was leaving to take his regards to the little Miss,  as he called Heidi.    With a promise to deliver this message the doctor was just hastening  out, when he encountered an obstacle. Miss Rottenmeier, who had been  obliged to return from her walk on account of the strong wind, was  just coming in. She wore a large cape, which the wind was blowing  about her like two full sails. Both had retreated politely to give way  to each other. Suddenly the wind seemed to carry the housekeeper  straight towards the doctor, who had barely time to avoid her. This  little incident, which had ruffled Miss Rottenmeier's temper very  much, gave the doctor occasion to soothe her, as she liked to be  soothed by this man, whom she respected more than anybody in the  world. Telling her of his intended visit, he entreated her to pack the  things for Heidi as only she knew how.    Clara had expected some resistance from Miss Rottenmeier about the  packing of her presents. What was her surprise when this lady showed  herself most obliging, and immediately, on being told, brought  together all the articles! First came a heavy coat for Heidi, with a  hood, which Clara meant her to use on visits to the grandmother in the  winter. Then came a thick warm shawl and a large box with coffee-cake  for the grandmother. An enormous sausage for Peter's mother followed,  and a little sack of tobacco for the grandfather. At last a lot of  mysterious little parcels and boxes were packed, things that Clara had  gathered together for Heidi. When the tidy pack lay ready on the  ground, Clara's heart filled with pleasure at the thought of her  little friend's delight.    Sebastian now entered, and putting the pack on his shoulder, carried  it to the doctor's house without delay.          XVI    A GUEST ON THE ALP      The early dawn was tinging the mountains and a fresh morning-breeze  rocked the old fir-trees to and fro. Heidi opened her eyes, for the  rustling of the wind had awakened her. These sounds always thrilled  her heart, and now they drew her out of bed. Rising hurriedly, she  soon was neatly dressed and combed.    Coming down the little ladder and finding the grandfather's bed empty,  she ran outside. The old man was looking up at the sky to see what the  weather was going to be like that day. Rosy clouds were passing  overhead, but gradually the sky grew more blue and deep, and soon a  golden light passed over the heights, for the sun was rising in all  his glory.    \"Oh, how lovely! Good-morning, grandfather,\" Heidi exclaimed.    \"Are your eyes bright already?\" the grandfather retorted, holding out  his hand.    Heidi then ran over to her beloved fir-trees and danced about, while  the wind was howling in the branches.    After the old man had washed and milked the goats, he brought them out  of the shed. When Heidi saw her friends again, she caressed them  tenderly, and they in their turn nearly crushed her between them.  Sometimes when Baerli got too wild, Heidi would say: \"But Baerli, you  push me like the Big Turk,\" and that was enough to quiet the goat.    Soon Peter arrived with the whole herd, the jolly Thistlefinch ahead  of all the others. Heidi, being soon in the mist of them, was pushed  about among them. Peter was anxious to say a word to the little girl,  so he gave a shrill whistle, urging the goats to climb ahead. When he  was near her he said reproachfully: \"You really might come with me  to-day!\"    \"No, I can't, Peter,\" said Heidi. \"They might come from Frankfurt any  time. I must be home when they come.\"    \"How often you have said that,\" grumbled the boy.    \"But I mean it,\" replied Heidi. \"Do you really think I want to be away  when they come from Frankfurt? Do you really think that, Peter?\"    \"They could come to uncle,\" Peter growled.    Then the grandfather's strong voice was heard: \"Why doesn't the army  go forward? Is it the field-marshal's fault, or the fault of the  troop?\"    Peter immediately turned about and led his goats up the mountain  without more ado.    Since Heidi had come home again to her grandfather she did many things  that had never occurred to her before. For instance, she would make  her bed every morning, and run about the hut, tidying and dusting.  With an old rag she would rub the chairs and table till they all  shone, and the grandfather would exclaim: \"It is always Sunday with us  now; Heidi has not been away in vain.\"    On this day after breakfast, when Heidi began her self-imposed task,  it took her longer than usual, for the weather was too glorious to  stay within. Over and over again a bright sunbeam would tempt the busy  child outside. How could she stay indoors, when the glistening  sunshine was pouring down and all the mountains seemed to glow? She  had to sit down on the dry, hard ground and look down into the valley  and all about her. Then, suddenly remembering her little duties, she  would hasten back. It was not long, though, till the roaring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#19)"],[1,"and build up deir homes again. Food, clothes,  and in fact everything needed, was scarce.    Mother always say, \"If you visit on New Years, you'll visit all de  year.\" We always had black-eyed peas and hog jowl for New Year's  dinner, for it brought good luck.    The Nineteenth of June was Emancipation Day, and we always had a big  picnic and speeches.    I knowed one woman who was a conjur woman. Lots of people went to her  to git her to break a evil spell dat some one had over them. She'd  brew a tea from herbs and give to 'em to drink, and it always cured  'em.    I've seen people use all kinds o' roots and herbs for medicine, and I  also seen 'em use all kind of things for cures. I've knowed 'em to put  wood lice in a bag and tie 'em 'round a baby's neck so it'd teeth  easy.    Black-haw root, sour dock, bear grass, grape root, bull nettle,  sweet-gum bark and red-oak bark boiled separately and mixed, makes a  good blood medicine.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    NANCY GARDNER  Age 79 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma      Well, to tell you de truth I don't know my age, but I was born in  1858, in Franklin, Tennessee. Now, you can figger for yourself and  tell how old I is. I is de daughter of Prophet and Callie Isaiah, and  dey was natives of Tennessee. Dere was three of us children, two boys  and myself. I'm de only girl. My brothers names was Prophet and Billie  Isaiah. I don't 'member much about dem as we was separated when I was  seven years old. I'll never forget when me, my ma and my auntie had to  leave my pa and brothers. It is jest as clear in my mind now as it was  den, and dat's been about seventy years ago.    Oh God! I tell you it was awful dat day when old Jeff Davis had a  bunch of us sent to Memphis to be sold. I can see old Major Clifton  now. He was a big nigger trader you know. Well, dey took us on up dere  to Memphis and we was sold jest like cattle. Dey sold me and ma  together and dey sold pa and de boys together. Dey was sent to  Mississippi and we was sent to Alabama. My pa, O how my ma was grieved  to death about him! She didn't live long after dat. She didn't live  long enough to be set free. Poor ma, she died a slave, but she is  saved though. I know she is, and I'll be wid her some day.    It was thirty years before my pa knew if we was still living. Finally  in some way he heard dat I was still alive, and he began writing me.  Course I was grown and married den and me and my husband had moved to  Missouri. Well, my pa started out to see me and on his way he was  drowned in de Missouri River, and I never saw him alive after we was  sold in Memphis.    I can't tell you much 'bout work during de slave days 'cause you see I  was jest a baby you might say when de War broke out. I do remember  our Master's name though, it was Dr. Perkins, and he was a good  Master. Ma and pa sure hated to have to leave him, he was so good to  dem. He was a rich man, and had a big fine house and thousands of  acres of land. He was good to his niggers too. We had a good house  too, better dan some of dese houses I see folks living in now. Course  Dr. Perkins niggers had to work, but dey didn't mind 'cause he would  let dem have little patches of dey own such as 'tatoes, corn, cotton  and garden. Jest a little, you know. He couldn't let dem have much,  there was so many on Dr. Perkins plantation.    I don't remember seeing anybody sick in slavery time. You see I was  jest a kid and dere's a lot of things I can't remember.    I am a Christian. I jined de church nigh on seventy years ago and when  I say dat, I don't mean I jest jined de church. I mean I gave myself  up to de Heavenly Father, and I've been gwine straight down de line  for Him ever since. You know in dem days, we didn't get religion like  young folks do now. Young folks today jest find de church and den call  theyselves Christians, but they aint.    I remember jest as well when I was converted. One day I was thinking  'bout a sermon de preacher had preached and a voice spoke to me and  said, \"De Holy Ghost is over your head. Accept it!\" Right den I got  down on my knees and prayed to God dat I might understand dat voice,  and God Almighty in a vision told me dat I should find de church. I  could hardly wait for de next service so I could find it, and when I  was in de water getting my baptisement, dat same voice spoke and said,  \"Now you have accepted don't turn back 'cause I will be wid you  always!\" O you don't know nothing 'bout dat kind of religion!    I 'member one night shortly after I jined de church I was laying in  bed and dere was a vine tied 'round my waist and dat vine extended  into de elements. O my God! I can see it now! I looked up dat vine  and away in de elements I could see my Divine Master and he spoke to  me and said, \"When you get in trouble shake dis vine; I'm your Master  and I will hear your cry.\"    I knowed old Jeff Davis good. Why I was jest as close to him as I am  to dat table. I've talked wid him too. I reckon I _do_ know dat  scoundrel! Why, he didn't want de niggers to be free! He was known as  a mean old rascal all over de South.    Abraham Lincoln? Now you is talking 'bout de niggers friend! Why dat  was de best man God ever let tramp de earth! Everybody was mighty sad  when poor old Abraham was 'sassinated, 'cause he did a mighty good  deed for de colored race before he left dis world.    I wasn't here long during slavery, but I saw enough of it to know it  was mighty hard going for most of de niggers den, and young folks  wouldn't stand for dat kind of treatment now. I know most of the young  folks would be killed, but they jest wouldn't stand for it. I would  hate to have to go through wid my little share of it again.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    OCTAVIA GEORGE  Age 85 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Okla.      I was born in Mansieur, Louisiana, 1852, Avoir Parish. I am the  daughter of Alfred and Clementine Joseph. I don't know much about my  grandparents other than my mother told me my grandfather's name was  Fransuai, and was one time a king in Africa.    Most of the slaves lived in log cabins, and the beds were home-made.  The mattresses were made out of moss gathered from trees, and we used  to have lots of fun gathering that moss to make those mattresses.    My job was taking care of the white children up at the Big House (that  is what they called the house where our master lived), and I also had  to feed the little Negro children. I remember quite well how those  poor little children used to have to eat. They were fed in boxes and  troughs, under the house. They were fed corn meal mush and beans. When  this was poured into their box they would gather around it the same as  we see pigs, horses and cattle gather around troughs today.    We were never given any money, but were able to get a little money  this way: our Master would let us have two or three acres of land each  year to plant for ourselves, and we could have what we raised on it.  We could not allow our work on these two or three acres to interfere  with Master's work, but we had to work our little crops on Sundays.  Now remind you, all the Negroes didn't get these two or three acres,  only good masters allowed their slaves to have a little crop of their  own. We would take the money from our little crops and buy a few  clothes and something for Christmas. The men would save enough money  out of the crops to buy their Christmas whiskey. It was all right for  the slaves to get drunk on Christmas and New Years Day; no one was  whipped for getting drunk on those days. We were allowed to have a  garden and from this we gathered vegetables to eat; on Sundays we  could have duck, fish, and pork.    We didn't know anything about any clothes other than cotton;  everything we wore was made of cotton, except our shoes, they were  made from pieces of leather cut out of a raw cowhide.    Our Master and Mistress was good, they let us go to church with them,  have our little two- or three-acre crops and any other thing that the  good masters would let their slaves do. They lived in a big fine house  and had a fine barn. Their barn was much better than the house we  lived in. Master Depriest (our master) was a Frenchman, and had eight  or nine children, and they were sure mean. They would fight us, but we  were not allowed to fight our little Master or Mistress as we had to  call them.    The overseer on Master's plantation was a mean old fellow, he carried  his gun all the time and would ride a big fine horse and go from one  bunch of slaves to the other. Some poor white folks lived close to us.  They could not own slaves and they had to work for the rich plantation  owners. I believe that those poor white folk are to blame for the  Negroes stealing because they would get the Negroes to steal their  master's corn, hogs, chickens and many other things and sell it to  them for practically nothing.    We had to work plenty hard, because our Master had a large plantation.  Don't know just how many acres it was, but we had to be up at 5  o'clock in the morning and would work until dark than we would have to  go home and do our night work, that is cook, milk, and feed the stock.    The slaves were punished for stealing, running off, not doing what  their master told them and for talking back to their master. If any of  these rules were disobeyed their feet and hands were chained together  and they were put across a log or a barrel and whipped until the blood  came from them.    There were no jails; the white man was the slaves' jail. If whipping  didn't settle the crime the Negro committed--the next thing would be  to hang him or burn him at stake.    I've seen them sell slaves. The whites would auction them off just as  we do cattle and horses today. The big fine healthy slaves were worth  more than those that were not quite so good. I have seen men sold from  their wives and I thought that was such a crime. I knew that God"]]]
