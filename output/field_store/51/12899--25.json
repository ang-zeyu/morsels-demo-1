Julian whistled and turned away moodily, with his hands in his  pockets, staring into space.    The old man the diviner was talking at large as he gathered the  fingers of wood with their rude traceries together. Julian paid  little heed to his words and gesticulations when he awoke from  his day-dream.    'Give him some skoff and a bit of meat, Jim,' he said. 'Tell him  I'll give him ten bob when I've got change.'    The old man was clamoring to him to make up his money to a  sovereign, but Julian paid no heed to what he said. He swung out  of the hut and off to wash for dinner, still brooding moodily.    At dinner. Tommy Bates found Julian the reverse of good company.  He did not keep his gloom to himself, and he snapped at any  excuse for snapping. Tommy left as the sweets came in, with an  excuse about meeting some friends at 8:30.    'Don't be late,' said Julian peremptorily. 'I want you here at  eleven sharp. I want to see about tomorrow's letters before I go  to bed.'    At 8:30 a pink note came in with the coffee. Mrs. Puce had sent  it down. It contained but a few lines:    DEAR JULIAN,    I'm so sorry, but I couldn't make head nor tail of the answer.  What I was told clearly was that you were likely to be in some  trouble to-night about midnight. I don't know what sort of  trouble, but somebody who lives at the back of your house may  have something to do with it. Do take care of yourself. I trust  you to do that for my sake. I think you are sensible enough to do  it, now you are forewarned. Come up to-morrow to breakfast and  reassure me,    Yours, in ever so much of a shudder,    CELIA.    Julian turned rather green as he read. 'I don't like it,' he  growled, 'Two signs, and independent ones. The one sign death. I  saw it myself when the bones were thrown. The other sign danger.  And Celia hasn't the sort of conscience that would let her invent  it. I don't know what to set about doing. But I must do something  or other.' He began to reflect. He started from the unsubstantial  grounds of twofold superstition, and tried to be practical in his  own defense.    'About midnight,' he thought, 'Well, I can trust Jim. And I can't  trust the other two boys that inhabit my back kitchen. Piet has  some of his own to get back for what I did last Christmas, and  the other boy I simply don't know. He was only sent to me to-day.  I'll tell Jim to go over to the location and take the other two  with him, and look after them for all of to-night. Tommy should  be back by eleven. We two ought to be able to look after  ourselves. Likely enough it's all moonshine this back-of-the-house  business.' He pitied himself for his anxieties, and took an  extra drink to dispel them. He went to the kitchen. Jim and the  new piccanin were just discussing the movements of somebody as he  arrived.    'When was it?' asked Jim.    'Just when the sun set,' the piccanin answered.    'Where?' asked Jim.    Then Julian cut them short, heedless of what they were saying.    'Lock up at once, and go over to the location. Mind, Jim, you  must look after the other two and see they don't come back here.  I don't want any boys on the place to-night. D'you hear?' Julian  proceeded to enlarge on the bigness of reward or punishment in  certain eventualities.    Julian went to his study, and put on his slippers. He called Jim  to light the wood-fire before he left. The night seemed a bitter  one, or was it that he had taken a chill? He took up a local  paper when Jim was gone. 'It's been a busy day,' he reflected, as  he straightened it out. 'Fancy my not looking at a paper of any  sort till this time of night.'    He searched the columns impatiently.    'No news to speak of,' he thought. But then he cried out as his  eye caught an out-of-the-way corner. 'Why, Hunter's dead!' The  news seemed to take his breath like a body-blow. 'A good man!' he  said to himself. 'The man who gave me the sop when he had dipped  it. The best of that Church gang! A man who called me an apostate  straight out more than once! The man who sent me that weird card  this morning! Yes and he sent me a quaint souvenir, a sort of  \"Memento Mori,\" once before, last Christmas, just when my boom  came off. I haven't forgotten the words yet. I will say to my  soul, \"Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take  thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\" And God said unto him,  \"Thou fool, this night.\"    'This night,' he muttered. 'I wish this night were well over.'    IV. VICISTI GALILAEE!        Julian was in a strange fit of tension when he heard Tommy Bates'  steps coming up the garden path. They were very uncertain steps.    Julian threw open his study door as the secretary reeled into the  hall. He had longed for company this last grey craven hour or  two, and this was all the company he was to enjoy for to-night at  least!    Humming and lurching and stinking of whisky as Tommy was, there  was not much comfort to be sought from him.    Julian swore at him sonorously then he hustled him off to bed.  Soon he was snoring. Julian had somehow shuffled away his fear in  his coercion of Tommy.    'I'll get my blankets and pillow out of my room, and lie down in  Tommy's. I feel I can sleep now,' he thought.    He went into his room heedlessly in the dark and trod on  something or somebody, just as he was striking a match.    It was the big black snake that lived in the ant-hill at the back  of the house whose movements Jim and the piccanin had been  discussing. The snake dealt with Julian.    Julian staggered about looking for crystals and a lancet. They  were locked up safely and perhaps Jim, or perhaps Tommy had the  key.    Tommy would not wake to any purpose. Just as Julian was shaking  him, the clock in the study a clock Julian had won in his  sprinting days chimed twelve very melodiously. Everything seemed  to be locked up. Had Jim the key of the spirit cupboard or Tommy?  Julian was growing drowsy in his struggles against the current of  fortune. Hadn't he better give in, and let himself be carried  down? Almost before he knew it, he was lying on the sofa in his  study where the lamp with the red shade was burning so cosily.  Likely enough his eye caught a quaint ornament on his study table  at the juncture the figure of the Serpent on the Cross.    It may be too, that some sort of startled respect came to him for  the Worm that had turned at last, not vindictively, but in the  interests of the Commonweal.    Probability points to this one fact at least, that Julian fumbled  for something in his pocket-book ere he resigned himself finally  to the growing torpor.    A card was found on the study floor when morning came; they found  the pocket-book itself on the conch beside him.    The card was the one that had come at his last breakfast-time  from Dick Hunter, the card that he had reserved rather indignantly  for future consideration.    On the one side of it was a color-process reproduction, very good  of its kind Christ in Glory the Rex Tremendoe Majestatis and also  the Fons Pietatis of the Dies Ira with tears in His Eyes and  thorns on His Brows as He judged just judgment. On the other side  were four lines from Browning, faithfully transcribed save for  the change of a name. They were written in the shaking writing of  a sick man, in Hunter's round, unformed hand:    'For the main criminal I have no hope  Except in such a suddenness of fate  So may the truth be by one blow flashed out.  And Julian see one instant and be saved.'    There is no question as to the suddenness of the stroke of fate  that ended Julian's career in South Africa. There is an open  question as to the illuminative force of that blow, and we must  wait for the answer.        THE DOUBLE CABIN        We had been close to a certain line of fire together, and yet we  had not seen much fighting. That is to say, we were taking part  in a campaign together that was for the time being an affair of  patrols near a certain border an affair that flashed into fire  now and then as between man and man. As between sun and man the  firing was fairly continuous for eight hours of most days. Were  we not within a hundred miles or so of the equator? In that  climatic struggle (so much the more constant of the two for us  Northerners) I on my noncombatant job came off lightly, he, as a  combatant, suffered. He was down with malaria time and time  again. He had it on him that night when he put me up at his place  a night when the old year was almost out. He was then inhabiting  a border outpost a clean little camp tucked away behind a native  village. It was none too airy, I thought, with its heavy curtains  of cactus hedging. He seemed a little better that next morning,  when I said prayers, and afterwards rehearsed a certain Rite. He  stayed to the end of my ministrations. After breakfast I started  again on my journey, a round that took me far from the centre of  our small world. When I touched that centre again I heard his  news, which was not so very reassuring. He had gone down with  blackwater, and been carried into a small hospital. There, having  almost gone out, he had rallied enough to be put on board a ship  crossing the lake. So he came to a greater hospital. It was  thither that I followed him up. He had had another crisis, I  found, but he was better again by the time I got to him. Then he  improved a little, and seemed to be convalescing. Then malaria  chose to interfere with the running of her sister fever's course.  This seemed extraordinarily meddlesome, and made things hazardous  still, though they were as well as one expected, when the time of  my going on leave came.    How glad I was to get off! My Good-byes were hurried when once  the brown envelope had come. I saw him on the hospital stoep  (baraza, did they call it in that alien part of Africa?) just as  I was rushing down to the station. He had lost his blue color,  but still looked rather"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#19)"],[1,"heat, for  Instance, is Blended with a hundred measures of Barley, there happens  only a _Juxta_-position and Superficial Contact betwixt the Grains of  wheat, and as many or thereabouts of the Grains of Barley. So when a  Drop of wine is mingl'd with a great deal of water, there is but an  Apposition of so many Vinous Corpuscles to a Correspondent Number of  Aqueous ones; Unless I say this be said, I see not how that Absurdity  will be avoyded, whereunto the Stoical Notion of mistion (namely by  [Greek: synchysis] [Errata: [Greek: Synchysis]], or Confusion) was  Liable, according to which the least Body may be co-extended with the  greatest: Since in a mixt Body wherein before the Elements were  Mingl'd there was, for Instance, but one pound of water to ten  thousand of Earth, yet according to them there must not be the least  part of that Compound, that Consisted not as well of Earth, as water.  But I insist, Perhaps, too long (sayes _Eleutherius_) upon the proofs  afforded me by the Nature of Mistion: Wherefore I will but name Two or  Three other Arguments; whereof the first shall be, that according to  _Aristotle_ himself, the motion of a mixt Body followes the Nature of  the Predominant Element, as those wherein the Earth prevails, tend  towards the Centre of heavy Bodies. And since many things make it  Evident, that in divers Mixt Bodies the Elementary Qualities are as  well Active, though not altogether so much so as in the Elements  themselves, it seems not reasonable to deny the actual Existence of  the Elements in those Bodies wherein they Operate.    To which I shall add this Convincing Argument, that Experience  manifests, and _Aristotle_ Confesses it, that the _Miscibilia_ may be  again separated from a mixt Body, as is Obvious in the Chymical  Resolutions of Plants and Animalls, which could not be unless they did  actually retain their formes in it: For since, according to  _Aristotle_, and I think according to truth, there is but one common  Mass of all things, which he has been pleas'd to call _Materia Prima_;  And since tis not therefore the Matter but the Forme that Constitutes  and Discriminates Things, to say that the Elements remain not in a  Mixt Body, according to their Formes, but according to their Matter,  is not to say that they remain there at all; Since although those  Portions of Matter were Earth and water, &c. before they concurr'd,  yet the resulting Body being once Constituted, may as well be said to  be simple as any of the Elements, the Matter being confessedly of the  same Nature in all Bodies, and the Elementary Formes being according  to this _Hypothesis_ perish'd and abolish'd.    And lastly, and if we will Consult Chymical Experiments, we shall find  the Advantages of the Chymical Doctrine above the Peripatetick Title  little less then Palpable. For in that Operation that Refiners call  Quartation, which they employ to purifie Gold, although three parts of  Silver be so exquisitely mingl'd by Fusion with a fourth Part of Gold  (whence the Operation is Denominated) that the resulting Mass acquires  severall new Qualities, by virtue of the Composition, and that there  is scarce any sensible part of it that is not Compos'd of both the  metalls; Yet if You cast this mixture into _Aqua Fortis_, the Silver  will be dissolv'd in the _Menstruum_, and the Gold like a dark or  black Powder will fall to the Bottom of it, and either Body may be  again reduc'd into such a Metal as it was before, which shews: that it  retain'd its Nature, notwithstanding its being mixt _per Minima_ with  the other: We likewise see, that though one part of pure Silver be  mingled with eight or ten Parts, or more, of Lead, yet the Fire will  upon the Cuppel easily and perfectly separate them again. And that  which I would have you peculiarly Consider on this Occasion is, that  not only in Chymicall Anatomies there is a Separation made of the  Elementary Ingredients, but that some Mixt Bodies afford a very much  greater Quantity of this or that Element or Principle than of another;  as we see, that Turpentine and Amber yield much more Oyl and Sulphur  than they do Water, whereas Wine, which is confess'd to be a perfectly  mixt Bodie, yields but a little Inflamable Spirit, or Sulphur, and not  much more Earth; but affords a vast proportion of Phlegm or water:  which could not be, if as the Peripateticks suppose, every, even of  the minutest Particles, were of the same nature with the whole, and  consequently did contain both Earth and Water, and Aire, and Fire;  Wherefore as to what _Aristotle_ principally, and almost only Objects,  that unless his Opinion be admitted, there would be no true and  perfect Mistion, but onely Aggregates or Heaps of contiguous  Corpuscles, which, though the Eye of Man cannot discerne, yet the Eye  of a _Lynx_ might perceive not to be of the same Nature with one  another and with their _Totum_, as the Nature of Mistion requires, if  he do not beg the Question, and make Mistion to consist in what other  Naturalists deny to be requisite to it, yet He at least objects That  as a great Inconvenience which I cannot take for such, till he have  brought as Considerable Arguments as I have propos'd to prove the  contrary, to evince that Nature makes other Mistions than such as I  have allowed, wherein the _Miscibilia_ are reduc'd into minute Parts,  and United as farr as sense can discerne: which if You will not grant  to be sufficient for a true Mistion, he must have the same Quarrel  with Nature her self, as with his Adversaries.    Wherefore (Continues _Eleutherius_) I cannot but somewhat marvail that  _Carneades_ should oppose the Doctrine of the Chymist in a Particular,  wherein they do as well agree with his old Mistress, Nature, as  dissent from his old Adversary, _Aristotle_.    I must not (replies _Carneades_) engage my self at present to examine  thorowly the Controversies concerning Mistion: And if there were no  third thing, but that I were reduc'd to embrace absolutely and  unreservedly either the Opinion of _Aristotle_, or that of the  Philosophers that went before him, I should look upon the latter,  which the Chymists have adopted, as the more defensible Opinion: But  because differing in the Opinions about the Elements from both  Parties, I think I can take a middle Course, and Discourse to you of  Mistion after a way that does neither perfectly agree, nor perfectly  disagree with either, as I will not peremptorily define, whether there  be not Cases wherein some _Phaenomena_ of Mistion seem to favour the  Opinion that the Chymists Patrons borrow'd of the Antients, I shall  only endeavour to shew You that there are some cases which may keep  the Doubt, which makes up my second General Consideration from being  unreasonable.    I shall then freely acknowledge to You (sayes _Carneades_) that I am  not over well satisfi'd with the Doctrine that is ascribed to  _Aristotle_, concerning Mistion, especially since it teaches that the  four Elements may again be separated from the mixt Body; whereas if  they continu'd not in it, it would not be so much a Separation as a  Production. And I think the Ancient Philosophers that Preceded  _Aristotle_, and Chymists who have since receiv'd the same Opinion, do  speak of this matter more intelligibly, if not more probably, then the  Peripateticks: but though they speak Congruously enough, to their  believing, that there are a certain Number of Primogeneal Bodies, by  whose Concourse all those we call Mixts are Generated, and which in  the Destruction of mixt Bodies do barely part company, and recede from  one another, just such as they were when they came together; yet I,  who meet with very few Opinions that I can entirely Acquiesce in,  must confess to You that I am inclin'd to differ not only from the  _Aristotelians_, but from the old Philosophers and the Chymists, about  the Nature of Mistion: And if You will give me leave, I shall Briefly  propose to you my present Notion of it, provided you will look upon  it, not so much as an Assertion as an _Hypothesis_; in talking of  which I do not now pretend to propose and debate the whole Doctrine of  Mistion, but to shew that 'tis not Improbable, that sometimes mingl'd  substances may be so strictly united, that it doth not by the usuall  Operations of the Fire, by which Chymists are wont to suppose  themselves to have made the _Analyses_ of mixt Bodies, sufficiently  appear, that in such Bodies the _Miscibilia_ that concurr'd to make  them up do each of them retain its own peculiar Nature: and by the  _Spagyrists_ Fires may be more easily extricated and Recover'd, than  Alter'd, either by a Change of Texture in the Parts of the same  Ingredient, or by an Association with some parts of another Ingredient  more strict than was that of the parts of this or that _Miscibile_  among themselves. At these words _Eleu._ having press'd him to do  what he propos'd, and promis'd to do what he desir'd;    I consider then (resumes _Carneades_) that, not to mention those  improper Kinds of mistion, wherein _Homogeneous_ Bodies are Joyn'd, as  when Water is mingl'd with water, or two Vessels full of the same kind  of Wine with one another, the mistion I am now to Discourse of seems,  Generally speaking, to be but an Union _per Minima_ of any two or more  Bodies of differing Denominations; as when Ashes and Sand are  Colliquated into Glass or Antimony, and Iron into _Regulus Martis_, or  Wine and Water are mingl'd, and Sugar is dissolv'd in the Mixture. Now  in this general notion of Mistion it does not appear clearly  comprehended, that the _Miscibilia_ or Ingredients do in their small  Parts so retain their Nature and remain distinct in the Compound, that  they may thence by the Fire be again taken asunder: For though I deny  not that in some Mistions of certain permanent Bodies this Recovery of  the same Ingredients may be made, yet I am not convinc'd that it will  hold in all or even in most,"]]]
