If it has got a heart at all, I'll  engage to send my spear right through the core of it; if it hasn't got a  heart, I'll send it through the spot where its heart ought to be.\"    \"Fire away, then, my boy,\" replied Jack with a laugh.    Peterkin immediately took the spear, poised it for a second or two above  his head, then darted it like an arrow into the sea.  Down it went  straight into the centre of the green object, passed quite through it,  and came up immediately afterwards, pure and unsullied, while the  mysterious tail moved quietly as before!    \"Now,\" said Peterkin gravely, \"that brute is a heartless monster; I'll  have nothing more to do with it.\"    \"I'm pretty sure now,\" said Jack, \"that it is merely a phosphoric light;  but I must say I'm puzzled at its staying always in that exact spot.\"    I also was much puzzled, and inclined to think with Jack that it must be  phosphoric light, of which luminous appearance we had seen much while on  our voyage to these seas.  \"But,\" said I, \"there is nothing to hinder us  from diving down to it, now that we are sure it is not a shark.\"    \"True,\" returned Jack, stripping off his clothes.  \"I'll go down, Ralph,  as I'm better at diving than you are.--Now, then, Peterkin, out o' the  road!\"  Jack stepped forward, joined his hands above his head, bent over  the rocks, and plunged into the sea.  For a second or two the spray  caused by his dive hid him from view; then the water became still, and  we saw him swimming far down in the midst of the green object.  Suddenly  he sank below it, and vanished altogether from our sight!  We gazed  anxiously down at the spot where he had disappeared for nearly a minute,  expecting every moment to see him rise again for breath; but fully a  minute passed and still he did not reappear.  Two minutes passed! and  then a flood of alarm rushed in upon my soul when I considered that,  during all my acquaintance with him, Jack had never stayed under water  more than a minute at a time--indeed, seldom so long.    \"Oh Peterkin!\"  I said in a voice that trembled with increasing anxiety,  \"something has happened.  It is more than three minutes now.\"  But  Peterkin did not answer; and I observed that he was gazing down into the  water with a look of intense fear mingled with anxiety, while his face  was overspread with a deadly paleness.  Suddenly he sprang to his feet  and rushed about in a frantic state, wringing his hands, and exclaiming,  \"Oh Jack!  Jack!  He is gone!  It must have been a shark, and he is gone  for ever!\"    For the next five minutes I know not what I did; the intensity of my  feelings almost bereft me of my senses.  But I was recalled to myself by  Peterkin seizing me by the shoulders and staring wildly into my face,  while he exclaimed, \"Ralph!  Ralph! perhaps he has only fainted!  Dive  for him, Ralph!\"    It seemed strange that this did not occur to me sooner.  In a moment I  rushed to the edge of the rocks, and without waiting to throw off my  garments, was on the point to spring into the waves when I observed  something black rising up through the green object.  In another moment  Jack's head rose to the surface, and he gave a wild shout, flinging back  the spray from his locks, as was his wont after a dive.  Now we were  almost as much amazed at seeing him reappear, well and strong, as we had  been at first at his non-appearance; for, to the best of our judgment,  he had been nearly ten minutes under water--perhaps longer--and it  required no exertion of our reason to convince us that this was utterly  impossible for mortal man to do and retain his strength and faculties.  It was, therefore, with a feeling akin to superstitious awe that I held  down my hand and assisted him to clamber up the steep rocks.  But no  such feeling affected Peterkin.  No sooner did Jack gain the rocks and  seat himself on one, panting for breath, than he threw his arms round  his neck and burst into a flood of tears.  \"Oh Jack!  Jack!\" said he,  \"where were you?  What kept you so long?\"    After a few moments Peterkin became composed enough to sit still and  listen to Jack's explanation, although he could not restrain himself  from attempting to wink every two minutes at me in order to express his  joy at Jack's safety.  I say he attempted to wink, but I am bound to add  that he did not succeed; for his eyes were so much swollen with weeping  that his frequent attempts only resulted in a series of violent and  altogether idiotical contortions of the face, that were very far from  expressing what he intended.  However, I knew what the poor fellow meant  by it; so I smiled to him in return, and endeavoured to make believe  that he was winking.    \"Now, lads,\" said Jack when we were composed enough to listen to him,  \"yon green object is not a shark; it is a stream of light issuing from a  cave in the rocks.  Just after I made my dive, I observed that this  light came from the side of the rock above which we are now sitting; so  I struck out for it, and saw an opening into some place or other that  appeared to be luminous within.  For one instant I paused to think  whether I ought to venture.  Then I made up my mind and dashed into it;  for you see, Peterkin, although I take some time to tell this, it  happened in the space of a few seconds, so that I knew I had wind enough  in me to serve to bring me out o' the hole and up to the surface again.  Well, I was just on the point of turning--for I began to feel a little  uncomfortable in such a place--when it seemed to me as if there was a  faint light right above me.  I darted upwards, and found my head out of  water.  This relieved me greatly, for I now felt that I could take in  air enough to enable me to return the way I came.  Then it all at once  occurred to me that I might not be able to find the way out again; but  on glancing downwards, my mind was put quite at rest by seeing the green  light below me streaming into the cave, just like the light that we had  seen streaming out of it, only what I now saw was much brighter.    \"At first I could scarcely see anything as I gazed around me, it was so  dark; but gradually my eyes became accustomed to it, and I found that I  was in a huge cave, part of the walls of which I observed on each side  of me.  The ceiling just above me was also visible, and I fancied that I  could perceive beautiful, glittering objects there; but the farther end  of the cave was shrouded in darkness.  While I was looking around me in  great wonder, it came into my head that you two would think I was  drowned; so I plunged down through the passage again in a great hurry,  rose to the surface, and--here I am!\"    When Jack concluded his recital of what he had seen in this remarkable  cave, I could not rest satisfied till I had dived down to see it; which  I did, but found it so dark, as Jack had said, that I could scarcely see  anything.  When I returned we had a long conversation about, it, during  which I observed that Peterkin had a most lugubrious expression on his  countenance.    \"What's the matter, Peterkin?\" said I.    \"The matter?\" he replied.  \"It's all very well for you two to be talking  away like mermaids about the wonders of this cave; but you know I must  be content to hear about it, while you are enjoying yourselves down  there like mad dolphins.  It's really too bad!\"    \"I'm very sorry for you, Peterkin--indeed I am,\" said Jack; \"but we  cannot help you.  If you would only learn to dive--\"    \"Learn to fly, you might as well say!\" retorted Peterkin in a very sulky  tone.    \"If you would only consent to keep still,\" said I, \"we would take you  down with us in ten seconds.\"    \"Hum!\" returned Peterkin; \"suppose a salamander was to propose to you  `only to keep still' and he would carry you through a blazing fire in a  few seconds, what would you say?\"    We both laughed and shook our heads, for it was evident that nothing was  to be made of Peterkin in the water.  But we could not rest satisfied  till we had seen more of this cave; so, after further consultation, Jack  and I determined to try if we could take down a torch with us, and set  fire to it in the cavern.  This we found to be an undertaking of no  small difficulty, but we accomplished it at last by the following means:  First, we made a torch of a very inflammable nature out of the bark of a  certain tree, which we cut into strips, and after twisting, cemented  together with a kind of resin or gum, which we also obtained from  another tree; neither of which trees, however, was known by name to  Jack.  This, when prepared, we wrapped up in a great number of plies of  cocoa-nut cloth, so that we were confident it could not get wet during  the short time it should be under water.  Then we took a small piece of  the tinder, which we had carefully treasured up lest we should require  it, as before said, when the sun should fail us; also, we rolled up some  dry grass and a few chips, which, with a little bow and drill, like  those described before, we made into another bundle and wrapped it up in  cocoa-nut cloth.  When all was ready we laid aside our garments, with  the exception of our trousers, which, as we did not know what rough  scraping against the rocks we might be subjected to, we kept on.    Then we advanced to the edge of the rocks--Jack carrying one bundle,  with the torch; I the other, with the things for producing fire.    \"Now don't weary for us, Peterkin, should we be gone some time,\" said  Jack.  \"We'll be sure to return in half-an-hour at the very latest,  however interesting the cave should be, that we may relieve your mind.\"    \"Farewell!\" said Peterkin, coming up to us with a look of deep but  pretended solemnity, while he shook hands and kissed each of us on the  cheek--\"farewell!  And while you are gone I shall repose my weary limbs  under the shelter of this bush, and meditate on the changefulness of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#19)"],[1,"of caustic  alkali should also be avoided, and, if more lye is required, great care  must be exercised in its addition.    Saponification being completed, the sugar solution is carefully and  gradually crutched into the soap; when the contents of the pan have  become a homogeneous and syrupy mass, the crutching is discontinued, and  the pan is covered for one hour. The heat of the soap in the pan should  not exceed 170 deg. F. (77 deg. C.).    Having rested the necessary period, the soap will have a slight froth on  the surface, but will be clear underneath and appear dark. Samples may  now be withdrawn, cooled, and examined prior to framing. If the process  has been successfully performed the soap will be firm and transparent,  of uniform colour, and possess only a faintly alkaline taste.    If the sample be firm but opaque, more sugar solution is required; this  should be added very carefully whilst crutching, an excess being  specially guarded against. If the sample be soft, although transparent,  and the alkaline taste not too pronounced, the soap evidently contains  an excess of water, which may be remedied by the addition of a small  quantity of soda ash; too much soda ash (carbonates) must be avoided,  lest it should produce efflorescence.    Having examined the soap and found it to be correct, or having remedied  its defects, the soap in the pan is allowed to cool to 145 deg. F. (63 deg. C.)  and perfume added. The soap is now quickly filled into narrow frames and  allowed to cool rapidly.    The blocks of soap should not be stripped until quite cold throughout,  and they should be allowed to stand open for a while before slabbing.  When freshly cut into tablets, the soap may appear somewhat turbid, but  the brightness comes with the exposure it will receive prior to stamping  and wrapping.    _Saponifying Mineral Oil._--This sounds somewhat incongruous, as mineral  oil is entirely unsaponifiable. Most of the suggestions for this purpose  consist of the incorporation of mineral oil, or mineral oil emulsified  by aid of Quillaia bark, with a cocoa-nut oil soap, and in all these  instances the hydrocarbon merely exists in suspension.    G. Reale (Fr. Pat. 321,510, 1902), however, proposes to heat mineral oil  together with spermaceti and strong alkali, and states that he  transforms the hydrocarbons into alcohols, and these, absorbing oxygen,  become fatty acids, which are converted into soap by means of the  alkali.    In this connection may be quoted the interesting work of Zelinsky  (_Russ. Phys. Chem. Ges. Zeits. Angew. Chem._, 1903, 37). He obtained  substances, by acting with carbon dioxide upon magnesia compounds of  chlorinated fractions of petroleum, which when decomposed by dilute  sulphuric acid, yielded various organic acids. One of these acids on  heating with glycerine formed tri-octin, which had the properties of a  fat.    Dr. Engler, in confirmation of the theory of the animal origin of some  petroleums, obtained what might be described as petroleum (for it  contained almost all the hydrocarbons present in the natural mineral  oil) by distilling animal fats and oils under pressure.    _Electrical Production of Soap._--Attempts have been made to produce  soap electrically by Messrs. Nodon, Brettonneau and Shee (Eng. Pat.  22,129, 1897), and also by Messrs. Merry and Noble (Eng. Pat. 2,372,  1900).    In the former patent, a mixture of soda-lye and fat is agitated by  electricity at a temperature of 194 deg.-212 deg. F. (90 deg.-100  deg. C.), while in the latter caustic alkali is electrolytically  produced from brine, and deposited on wire-netting in the presence  of fat, which is thereby saponified.          CHAPTER VI.    TREATMENT OF SETTLED SOAP.         _Cleansing--Crutching--Liquoring of       Soaps--Filling--Neutralising, Colouring and       Perfuming--Disinfectant Soaps--Framing--Slabbing--Barring--Open       and Close Piling--Drying--Stamping--Cooling._      _Cleansing._--After completion of saponification, and allowing the  contents of the pan to settle into the various layers, as described in  the preceding chapter, the actual soap, forming the second layer, is now  transferred to the frames, this being generally termed \"cleansing\" the  soap. The thin crust or layer at the top of the pan is gently removed,  and the soap may be either ladled out and conveyed to the frames, or  withdrawn by the aid of a pump from above the nigre through a skimmer  (Fig. 1), and pipe, attached by means of a swivel joint (Fig. 2) (which  allows the skimmer pipe to be raised or lowered at will by means of a  winch, Fig. 3), to a pipe fitted in the side of the pan as fully shown  in Fig. 4, or the removal may be performed by gravitation through some  mechanical device from the side of the copper.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Skimmer, with flange for attachment to  skimmer-pipe.]    Every precaution is taken to avoid the presence of nigre in the soap  being cleansed.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Swivel-joint.]    The temperature at which soap may be cleansed depends on the particular  grade--soaps requiring to be liquored should not be cleansed too hot or  a separation will take place, 150 deg. F. (66 deg. C.) may be taken as a  suitable temperature for this class of soap; in the case of firm soaps,  such as milling base, where cooling is liable to take place in the pan  (and thus affect the yield), the temperature may be 165 deg.-170 deg. F.  (74 deg.-77 deg. C.). This latter class of soap is generally run direct to the  frames and crutched by hand, or, to save manual labour, it may be run  into a power-driven crutching pan (neutralising material being added if  necessary) and stirred a few times before framing.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Winch.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Soap-boiling pan, showing skimmer pipe, swivel  and winch.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Hand crutch.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Mechanical crutcher.]    _Crutching._--This consists of stirring the hot soap in the frames by  hand crutches (Fig. 5) until the temperature is sufficiently lowered and  the soap begins to assume a \"ropiness\". Crutching may also be performed  mechanically. There are various types of mechanical crutchers,  stationary and travelling. They may be cylindrical pans, jacketed or  otherwise, in the centre of which is rotated an agitator, consisting of  a vertical or horizontal shaft carrying several blades (Fig. 6) or the  agitator may take the form of an Archimedean screw working in a cylinder  (Fig. 7).    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Mechanical crutcher.]    The kind of soap to be crutched, whether thin or stiff, will determine  the most suitable type for the purpose. The former class includes  \"washer\" soap which is generally neutralised, and coloured and perfumed,  if necessary, in these crutching pans, and in that case they are merely  used for mixing the liquids with the hot soap prior to its passage along  wooden spouts (Fig. 8) provided with outlets over the frames, in which  the crutching is continued by hand. In the case of stiff soaps requiring  complete incorporation of liquor, the screw type is preferable, the soap  being forced upwards by the screw, and descending between the cylinder  and the sides of the pan, while the reverse action can also be brought  into play. The completion of crutching is indicated by the smoothness  and stiffness of the soap when moved with a trowel, and a portion taken  out at this point and cooled should present a rounded appearance. When  well mixed the resultant product is emptied directly into wheel-frames  placed underneath the outlet of the pan. It is important that the blades  or worm of the agitating gear be covered with soap to avoid the  occlusion of air and to prevent the soap becoming soft and spongy.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Wooden soap spout.]    _Liquoring of Soaps._--This consists of the addition of various alkaline  solutions to soap to produce different qualities, and is best performed  in the crutching machines, although it is in some instances carried out  in the frames. In the history of soap-making a large number and variety  of substances have been suggested for the purpose of accomplishing some  real or supposed desirable effect when added to soap. Many of these have  had only a very short existence, and others have gradually fallen out of  use.    Amongst the more practical additions most frequently adopted may be  mentioned carbonate of soda, silicate of soda, and pearl ash (impure  carbonate of potash). The carbonate of soda may be used in the form of  \"soda crystals,\" which, containing 62.9 per cent. of water, dissolves in  its own water of crystallisation on heating, and is in that manner added  to the hot soap. In the case of weak-bodied soap, this addition gives  firmness and tends to increase the detergent qualities.    The soda carbonate may also be added to soap as a solution of soda ash  (58 deg. alkali) either concentrated, 62 deg. Tw. (34 deg. B.), or of various  strengths from 25 deg. Tw. (16 deg. B.) upwards. This solution stiffens and  hardens soap, and the addition, which must not be excessive, or  efflorescence will occur, is generally made at a temperature of 140 deg. F.  (60 deg. C.). Care should always be taken in the choice of solutions for  liquoring. Strong soda ash solution with a firm soap will result in a  brittle product, whereas the texture of a weak soap would be greatly  improved by such addition.    A slight addition of a weak solution of pearl ash, 4 deg.-8 deg. Tw. (2.7-5.4 deg.  B.), improves the appearance of many soaps intended for household  purposes.    For yellow soaps, containing a low percentage of fatty acids, solutions  of silicate of soda of varying strengths are generally used.    It is always advisable to have a test sample made with the soap to  ascertain what proportion and what strength of sodium silicate solution  is best suited for the grade of soap it is desired to produce. It is  important that"]]]
