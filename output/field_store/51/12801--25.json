Downward, downward, lies your way; nor can  anything but death avail to stop you.\"    \"It is true,\" Markheim said huskily, \"I have in some degree complied  with evil. But it is so with all; the very saints, in the mere  exercise of living, grow less dainty, and take on the tone of their  surroundings.\"    \"I will propound to you one simple question,\" said the other; \"and as  you answer I shall read to you your moral horoscope. You have grown  in many things more lax; possibly you do right to be so; and at any  account, it is the same with all men. But granting that, are you in any  one particular, however trifling, more difficult to please with your own  conduct, or do you go in all things with a looser rein?\"    \"In any one?\" repeated Markheim, with an anguish of consideration. \"No,\"  he added, with despair; \"in none! I have gone down in all.\"    \"Then,\" said the visitor, \"content yourself with what you are, for  you will never change; and the words of your part on this stage are  irrevocably written down.\"    Markheim stood for a long while silent, and, indeed, it was the visitor  who first broke the silence. \"That being so,\" he said, \"shall I show you  the money?\"    \"And grace?\" cried Markheim.    \"Have you not tried it?\" returned the other. \"Two or three years ago  did I not see you on the platform of revival meetings, and was not your  voice the loudest in the hymn?\"    \"It is true,\" said Markheim; \"and I see clearly what remains for me by  way of duty. I thank you for these lessons from my soul; my eyes are  opened, and I behold myself at last for what I am.\"    At this moment, the sharp note of the door-bell rang through the house;  and the visitant, as though this were some concerted signal for which he  had been waiting, changed at once in his demeanour.    \"The maid!\" he cried. \"She has returned, as I forewarned you, and there  is now before you one more difficult passage. Her master, you must  say, is ill; you must let her in, with an assured but rather serious  countenance; no smiles, no overacting, and I promise you success!  Once the girl within, and the door closed, the same dexterity that has  already rid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last danger in  your path. Thenceforward you have the whole evening--the whole night,  if needful--to ransack the treasures of the house and to make good your  safety. This is help that comes to you with the mask of danger. Up!\"  he cried; \"up, friend. Your life hangs trembling in the scales; up, and  act!\"    Markheim steadily regarded his counsellor. \"If I be condemned to evil  acts,\" he said, \"there is still one door of freedom open: I can cease  from action. If my life be an ill thing, I can lay it down. Though I be,  as you say truly, at the beck of every small temptation, I can yet, by  one decisive gesture, place myself beyond the reach of all. My love of  good is damned to barrenness; it may, and let it be! But I have still my  hatred of evil; and from that, to your galling disappointment, you shall  see that I can draw both energy and courage.\"    The features of the visitor began to undergo a wonderful and lovely  change: they brightened and softened with a tender triumph, and, even  as they brightened, faded and dislimned. But Markheim did not pause  to watch or understand the transformation. He opened the door and went  downstairs very slowly, thinking to himself. His past went soberly  before him; he beheld it as it was, ugly and strenuous like a dream,  random as chance medley--a scene of defeat. Life, as he thus reviewed  it, tempted him no longer; but on the further side he perceived a quiet  haven for his bark. He paused in the passage, and looked into the shop,  where the candle still burned by the dead body. It was strangely silent.  Thoughts of the dealer swarmed into his mind, as he stood gazing. And  then the bell once more broke out into impatient clamour.    He confronted the maid upon the threshold with something like a smile.    \"You had better go for the police,\" said he; \"I have killed your  master.\"          QUEEN TITA'S WAGER, by William Black          I--FRANZISKA FAHLER    It is a Christmas morning in Surrey--cold, still and gray, with a frail  glimmer of sunshine coming through the bare trees to melt the hoar-frost  on the lawn. The postman has just gone out, swinging the gate behind  him. A fire burns brightly in the breakfast-room; and there is silence  about the house, for the children have gone off to climb Box Hill before  being marched to church.    The small and gentle lady who presides over the household walks sedately  in, and lifts the solitary letter that is lying on her plate. About  three seconds suffice to let her run through its contents, and then she  suddenly cries:    \"I knew it! I said it! I told you two months ago she was only flirting  with him; and now she has rejected him. And oh! I am so glad of it! The  poor boy!\"    The other person in the room, who had been meekly waiting for his  breakfast for half an hour, ventures to point out that there is nothing  to rejoice over in the fact of a young man having been rejected by a  young woman.    \"If it were final, yes! If these two young folks were not certain to go  and marry somebody else, you might congratulate them both. But you know  they will. The poor boy will go courting again in three months' time,  and be vastly pleased with his condition.\"    \"Oh, never, never!\" she says. \"He has had such a lesson! You know I  warned him. I knew she was only flirting with him. Poor Charlie! Now I  hope he will get on with his profession, and leave such things out of  his head. And as for that creature--\"    \"I will do you the justice to say,\" observes her husband, who is still  regarding the table with a longing eye, \"that you did oppose this  match, because you hadn't the making of it. If you had brought these  two together they would have been married ere this. Never mind; you can  marry him to somebody of your own choosing now.\"    \"No,\" she says, with much decision; \"he must not think of marriage. He  cannot think of it. It will take the poor lad a long time to get over  this blow.\"    \"He will marry within a year.\"    \"I will bet you whatever you like that he doesn't,\" she says,  triumphantly.    \"Whatever I like! That is a big wager. If you lose, do you think you  could pay? I should like, for example, to have my own way in my own  house.\"    \"If I lose you shall,\" says the generous creature; and the bargain is  concluded.    Nothing further is said about this matter for the moment. The children  return from Box Hill, and are rigged out for church. Two young people,  friends of ours, and recently married, having no domestic circle of  their own, and having promised to spend the whole Christmas Day with  us, arrived. Then we set out, trying as much as possible to think that  Christmas Day is different from any other day, and pleased to observe  that the younger folk, at least, cherish the delusion.    But just before reaching the church I say to the small lady who got the  letter in the morning, and whom we generally call Tita:    \"When do you expect to see Charlie?\"    \"I don't know,\" she answers. \"After this cruel affair he won't like to  go about much.\"    \"You remember that he promised to go with us to the Black Forest?\"    \"Yes; and I am sure it will be a pleasant trip for him.\"    \"Shall we go to Huferschingen?\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"Franziska is a pretty girl.\"    Now you would not think that any great mischief could be done by the  mere remark that Franziska was a pretty girl. Anybody who had seen  Franziska Fahler, niece of the proprietor of the \"Goldenen Bock\" in  Huferschingen, would admit that in a moment. But this is nevertheless  true, that our important but diminutive Queen Tita was very thoughtful  during the rest of our walk to this little church; and in church, too,  she was thinking so deeply that she almost forgot to look at the effect  of the decorations she had nailed up the day before. Yet nothing could  have offended in the bare observation that Franziska was a pretty girl.    At dinner in the evening we had our two guests and a few young fellows  from London who did not happen to have their families or homes there.  Curiously enough, there was a vast deal of talk about travelling, and  also about Baden, and more particularly about the southern districts  of Baden. Tita said the Black Forest was the most charming place in the  world; and as it was Christmas Day, and as we had been listening to  a sermon all about charity and kindness and consideration for others,  nobody was rude enough to contradict her. But our forbearance was put to  a severe test when, after dinner, she produced a photographic album and  handed it round, and challenged everybody to say whether the young lady  in the corner was not absolutely lovely. Most of them said that she was  certainly very nice-looking; and Tita seemed a little disappointed.    I perceived that it would no longer do to say that Franziska was a  pretty girl. We should henceforth have to swear by everything we held  dear that she was absolutely lovely.          II--ZUM \"GOLDENEN BOCK\"    We felt some pity for the lad when we took him abroad with us; but it  must be confessed that at first he was not a very desirable travelling  companion. There was a gloom about him. Despite the eight months that  had elapsed, he professed that his old wound was still open. Tita  treated him with the kindest maternal solicitude, which was a great  mistake; tonics, not sweets, are required in such cases. Yet he was very  grateful, and he said, with a blush, that, in any case, he would not  rail against all women because of the badness of one. Indeed, you would  not have fancied he had any great grudge against womankind. There were  a great many English abroad that autumn, and we met whole batches of  pretty girls at every station and at every _table d'hote_ on our route.  Did"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#19)"],[1,"is a strange tale,\" he said, when Harry brought the story to a  conclusion, \"and explains things which have, at times, surprised  me. In the first place, the colour of your eyes always struck me as  peculiar. Then your figure is not that of my countrymen. There are  many as tall as you; but they have not your width of shoulders, and  strong build. Lastly, I have wondered how a young Mahratta should  be endowed with so much energy and readiness, be willing to take  heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and to be so full of  resource.    \"Now that you have told me your story, I think you are right to go  down and join your own people. Everything is disturbed, and nothing  is certain from day to day here. I was a fugitive but a short time  ago and, ere long, I may again be an exile.    \"Moreover, no one can tell what may happen to him. Your people are  quarrelling with Tippoo, as they quarrelled with his father, Hyder;  and I think that, before long, it is possible they will overthrow  him, and take possession of his territory.    \"Were the various powers of India united, this could not be so; but  the English will always find some ready to enter into an alliance  with them, and will so enlarge their dominions. The Mahrattas may  laugh at the idea of their being overthrown, by such small armies  as those the English generals command; but our constant  dissensions, and the mutual jealousy between Holkar, Scindia, the  Peishwa, the Rajah of Berar, and others, will prevent our ever  acting together. It may be that we shall be conquered piecemeal.    \"I have watched, very closely, all that has taken place in southern  India and in Bengal. I have seen a handful of traders gradually  swallowing up the native powers, and it seems to me that it may  well be that, in time, they may become the masters of all India.  Were I to say as much to any of our princes, they would scoff at my  prediction; but it has been my business to learn what was passing  elsewhere, and I have agents at Madras and Calcutta, and their  reports are ever that the power of the English is increasing. A few  years ago, it seemed that the French were going to carry all before  them; but they, like our native princes, have gone down before the  English; who seem, moreover, to get on better than the French with  the natives, and to win their respect and liking.    \"Well, young sir, I shall be sorry to lose you; because while I, and  with good reason, was seldom able to trust, and to give my absolute  confidence to any of those around me, I have always felt that I could  wholly rely on you. During the past year I have seen much of you, and  have freely told my plans to you, as I have done to no others; and  have chosen you for missions that I could not, with safety, have  entrusted to any of my own followers, knowing that Scindia or Holkar  would be ready to pay great sums for these secrets. None except Bajee,  to whom I sent you with particulars, were aware of the extent of my  plans, or that I was in communication with more than one of the rajahs.    \"You have played your part marvellously well, for I should not have  deemed it possible that one of your race could live so long among  us, without exciting any suspicion. While you remain in Bombay, I  hope that you will act as my confidential agent. I do not ask you  to divulge any secrets you may learn, relating to projects  connected with the Deccan; but I should like to be informed as to  the course of affairs, generally. Of course, my dealings with the  Council there must be carried on through the English Resident; but  there is much information respecting the views of the Council with  regard to Tippoo, the Nizam, and Bengal, that will be valuable for  me to know.\"    \"I could not so act, your excellency, without permission from the  Council; but I should imagine that they would not be averse to such  an arrangement, especially as, perhaps, you would give me private  information as to the state of parties, here, such as you would not  care to tell their Resident.\"    \"Certainly I would do so. They change their Residents so frequently  that it would be impossible for new men to really understand the  situation; which you, with your intimate knowledge of Poona, could  readily grasp. Of course the arrangement could only be temporary,  as my own position is so uncertain and, in any case, my life cannot  now be a long one.    \"I should propose that your salary, as my private agent, be a  thousand rupees a month.\"    \"I thank you much, sir; and if I stay at Bombay, and obtain the  permission of the Council to correspond with you, I will readily  undertake the part. They can have little objection to the  arrangement, as doubtless you have agents in Bombay, already.\"    \"Certainly I have, but these are natives, and necessarily can only  send me the rumours current in the bazaars, or known generally to  the public; and their news is, for the most part, worthless.\"    \"I have another favour to request,\" Harry said; \"namely, that you  will give leave of absence to Sufder, in order that he may  accompany me to Bombay. He and my old nurse could, alone,  substantiate my birth and identity; and it would be necessary for  them to give their evidence before some legal authority.\"    \"That I will readily do. Sufder is honest and faithful, and I can  rely upon him, absolutely, for anything in his sphere of duty; and  have, only today, appointed him to the command of two hundred men;  but although he has a hand ready to strike, he has no brain capable  of planning. Had it not been so, I should before this have raised  him to a higher position. When he returns from Bombay, I will grant  him the revenues of a village, of which he shall be the patal [a  mayor]; so that, in his old age, he will be able to live in  comfort.\"    On leaving the minister, Harry went to Sufder's camp.    \"'So you are back again, Puntojee?\"    \"Yes, and have brought Soyera down with me.\"    \"I have great news to tell you,\" the soldier went on.    \"It will not be news to me, Sufder. I know that your command has  been doubled, and that you will now be the captain of two hundred  men; but I can tell you much more than that. You are to accompany  me down to Bombay, the day after tomorrow, so as to give evidence  about my birth; and furthermore, Nana will, on your return, bestow  upon you the jagheer [revenue] of a village district; so that, as  he says, when you grow too old for service, you will be able to  live comfortably.\"    \"That is good news indeed--better even than that I am to have the  command of two hundred men, for in truth I am beginning to be weary  of service. I am now nearly fifty, and I feel myself growing stiff.  Nothing would please me more than to be the patal of a village  community, of which I hold the jagheer. However, so long as Nana  lives and retains power I shall remain a soldier; but at his death  I shall serve no other master, and shall take to country life  again.    \"Does Nana know that you are English?\"    \"Yes, I have told him my story. I was obliged to give my reasons  for resigning and, as Nana has the support of the Government of  Bombay, there was no risk in my doing so.    \"How long will it be before I get quite rid of this colour,  Sufder?\"    \"That I cannot say. I should think that in a fortnight the greater  part of it will have faded out, but maybe Soyera knows of something  that will remove it more rapidly.\"    Soyera, when asked, said that she knew of nothing that would remove  the dye at once; but that if he washed his hands and face, two or  three times a day, with a strong lye made from the ashes of a plant  that grows everywhere on the plain, it would help to get rid of it.    \"I will go out, tomorrow morning, and fetch some in.\"    When she had made the lye, and mixed it with oil, it made a very  strong soap.    \"How do you mean to dress, to go down, Harry?\"    \"I have no choice; but even if I had, I should ride out of here in  my best court suit, and change it for English clothes when we got  down the Ghauts. I may have to come up here again, for aught I  know; and it is better, therefore, that no one should know that I  am English.\"    Mr. Malet, however, solved the difficulty; for when, in the  evening, Harry went to enquire about the time that they would  start, he said:    \"I had been thinking of offering you a suit to ride down in but,  unfortunately, my clothes would be a great deal too small for you.  However, I think that, after all, it is best you should go down as  you are. In the first place, you would not show to advantage in  English clothes, in which you would feel tight and uncomfortable,  at first; and in the second place, I think that it is perhaps as  well that the Council should see you as you are, then they would  the better understand how you have been able to pass as a Mahratta,  all these years.    \"I will introduce you, now, to Colonel Palmer. It is important that  he should know you, for possibly you may be sent up here on some  mission or other--for which, having the favour of Nana, you would  be specially fitted.\"    Accordingly, the next morning they started early. Soyera had  prepared the liquid soap, but as it was decided that he should go  in native dress, Harry thought it as well not to use it, especially  as the dye was gradually wearing off. The party consisted of Mr.  Malet, Sufder, and Harry; with an escort of ten cavalrymen,  belonging to one of the native regiments. The mission clerk had  been transferred to Colonel Palmer, as his knowledge of affairs  would be useful to the newcomer. Soyera was carried in a dhoolie,  and followed close behind the troopers.    That evening they descended the Ghauts into the Concan and encamped  there and, on the following day, rode into Bombay; where Mr. Malet  took them to an hotel, principally used by natives of rank visiting  Bombay.    \"You had best stay here, till I send for you,\" he said, to Harry.  \"I shall see some "]]]
