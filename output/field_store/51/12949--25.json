Together they went through Midgard, mingling  with men of all sorts, kings and farmers, outlaws and true men, warriors  and householders, thralls and councillors, courteous men and men who  were ill-mannered. One day they came to the bank of a mighty river and  there they rested, listening to the beat of iron upon iron in a place  near by.    Presently, on a rock in the middle of the river, they saw an otter  come. The otter went into the water and came back to the rock with a  catch of salmon. He devoured it there. Then Odin saw Loki do a senseless  and an evil thing. Taking up a great stone he flung it at the otter. The  stone struck the beast on the skull and knocked him over dead.    \"Loki, Loki, why hast thou done a thing so senseless and so evil?\" Odin  said. Loki only laughed. He swam across the water and came back with the  creature of the river. \"Why didst thou take the life of the beast?\" Odin  said.    \"The mischief in me made me do it,\" said Loki. He drew out his knife and  ripping the otter up he began to flay him. When the skin was off the  beast he folded it up and stuck it in his belt. Then Odin and he left  that place by the river.    They came to a house with two smithies beside it, and from the smithies  came the sound of iron beating upon iron. They went within the house and  they asked that they might eat there and rest themselves.    An old man who was cooking fish over a fire pointed out a bench to them.  \"Rest there,\" said he, \"and when the fish is cooked I will give you  something good to eat. My son is a fine fisher and he brings me salmon  of the best.\"    Odin and Loki sat on the bench and the old man went on with his cooking.  \"My name is Hreidmar,\" he said, \"and I have two sons who work in the  smithies without. I have a third son also. It is he who does the fishing  for us. And who may ye be, O wayfaring men?\"    Loki and Odin gave names to Hreidmar that were not the names by which  they were known in Asgard or on Midgard. Hreidmar served fish to them  and they ate. \"And what adventures have ye met upon your travels?\"  Hreidmar asked. \"Few folk come this way to tell me of happenings.\"    \"I killed an otter with a cast of a stone,\" Loki said with a laugh.    \"You killed an otter!\" Hreidmar cried. \"Where did you kill one?\"    \"Where I killed him is of no import to you, old man,\" said Loki. \"His  skin is a good one, however. I have it at my belt.\"    Hreidmar snatched the skin out of Loki's belt. As soon as he held the  skin before his eyes he shrieked out, \"Fafnir, Regin, my sons, come here  and bring the thralls of your smithies. Come, come, come!\"    \"Why dost thou make such an outcry, old man?\" said Odin.    \"Ye have slain my son Otter,\" shrieked the old man. \"This in my hands is  the skin of my son.\"    As Hreidmar said this two young men bearing the forehammers of the  smithies came in followed by the thralls. \"Strike these men dead with  your forehammers, O Fafnir, O Regin,\" their father cried. \"Otter, who  used to stay in the river, and whom I changed by enchantment into a  river beast that he might fish for me, has been slain by these men.\"    \"Peace,\" said Odin. \"We have slain thy son, it would seem, but it was  unwittingly that we did the deed. We will give a recompense for the  death of thy son.\"    \"What recompense will ye give?\" said Hreidmar, looking at Odin with eyes  that were small and sharp.    Then did Odin, the Eldest of the Gods, say a word that was unworthy of  his wisdom and his power. He might have said, \"I will bring thee a  draught of Mimir's well water as a recompense for thy son's death.\" But  instead of thinking of wisdom, Odin All-Father thought of gold. \"Set a  price on the life of thy son and we will pay that price in gold,\" he  said.    \"Maybe ye are great kings traveling through the world,\" Hreidmar said.  \"If ye are ye will have to find gold that will cover every hair upon the  skin of him whom ye have killed.\"    Then did Odin, his mind being fixed upon the gold, think upon a certain  treasure, a treasure that was guarded by a Dwarf. No other treasure in  the nine worlds would be great enough to make the recompense that  Hreidmar claimed. He thought upon this treasure and he thought on how it  might be taken and yet he was ashamed of his thought.    \"Dost thou, Loki, know of Andvari's hoard?\" he said.    \"I know of it,\" said Loki sharply, \"and I know where it is hidden. Wilt  thou, Odin, win leave for me to fetch Andvari's hoard?\"    Odin spoke to Hreidmar. \"I will stay with thee as a hostage,\" he said,  \"if thou wilt let this one go to fetch a treasure that will cover the  otter's skin hair by hair.\"    \"I will let this be done,\" said old Hreidmar with the sharp and cunning  eyes. \"Go now,\" said he to Loki. Then Loki went from the house.    Andvari was a Dwarf who, in the early days, had gained for himself the  greatest treasure in the nine worlds. So that he might guard this  treasure unceasingly he changed himself into a fish--into a pike--and he  swam in the water before the cave where the hoard was hidden.    All in Asgard knew of the Dwarf and of the hoard he guarded. And there  was a thought amongst all that this hoard was not to be meddled with and  that some evil was joined to it. But now Odin had given the word that it  was to be taken from the Dwarf. Loki set out for Andvari's cave  rejoicingly. He came to the pool before the cave and he watched for a  sight of Andvari. Soon he saw the pike swimming cautiously before the  cave.    He would have to catch the pike and hold him till the treasure was given  for ransom. As he watched the pike became aware of him. Suddenly he  flung himself forward in the water and went with speed down the stream.    Not with his hands and not with any hook and line could Loki catch that  pike. How, then, could he take him? Only with a net that was woven by  magic. Then Loki thought of where he might get such a net.    Ran, the wife of old AEgir, the Giant King of the Sea, had a net that was  woven by magic. In it she took all that was wrecked on the sea. Loki  thought of Ran's net and he turned and went back to AEgir's hall to ask  for the Queen. But Ran was seldom in her husband's dwelling. She was now  down by the rocks of the sea.    He found Ran, the cold Queen, standing in the flow of the sea, drawing  out of the depths with the net that she held in her hands every piece  of treasure that was washed that way. She had made a heap of the things  she had drawn out of the sea, corals and amber, and bits of gold and  silver, but still she was plying her net greedily.    \"Thou knowst me, AEgir's wife,\" said Loki to her.    \"I know thee, Loki,\" said Queen Ran.    \"Lend me thy net,\" said Loki.    \"That I will not do,\" said Queen Ran.    \"Lend me thy net that I may catch Andvari the Dwarf who boasts that he  has a greater treasure than ever thou wilt take out of the sea,\" said  Loki.    The cold Queen of the sea ceased plying her net. She looked at Loki  steadily. Yes, if he were going to catch Andvari she would lend her net  to him. She hated all the Dwarfs because this one and that one had told  her they had greater treasures than ever she would be mistress of. But  especially she hated Andvari, the Dwarf who had the greatest treasure in  the nine worlds.    \"There is nothing more to gather here,\" she said, \"and if thou wilt  swear to bring me back my net by tomorrow I shall lend it to you.\"    \"I swear by the sparks of Muspelheim that I will bring thy net back to  thee by tomorrow, O Queen of AEgir,\" Loki cried. Then Ran put into his  hands the Magic Net. Back then he went to where the Dwarf, transformed,  was guarding his wondrous hoard.    Dark was the pool in which Andvari floated as a pike; dark it was, but  to him it was all golden with the light of his wondrous treasure. For  the sake of this hoard he had given up his companionship with the  Dwarfs and his delight in making and shaping the things of their  workmanship. For the sake of his hoard he had taken on himself the  dumbness and deafness of a fish.    Now as he swam about before the cave he was aware again of a shadow  above him. He slipped toward the shadow of the bank. Then as he turned  round he saw a net sweeping toward him. He sank down in the water. But  the Magic Net had spread out and he sank into its meshes.    Suddenly he was out of the water and was left gasping on the bank. He  would have died had he not undone his transformation.    Soon he appeared as a Dwarf. \"Andvari, you are caught; it is one of the  AEsir who has taken you,\" he heard his captor say.    \"Loki,\" he gasped.    \"Thou art caught and thou shalt be held,\" Loki said to him. \"It is the  will of the AEsir that thou give up thy hoard to me.\"    \"My hoard, my hoard!\" the Dwarf shouted. \"Never will I give up my  hoard.\"    \"I hold thee till thou givest it to me,\" said Loki.    \"Unjust, unjust,\" shouted Andvari. \"It is only thou, Loki, who art  unjust. I will go to the throne of Odin and I will have Odin punish thee  for striving to rob me of my treasure.\"    \"Odin has sent me to fetch thy hoard to him,\" said Loki.    \"Can it be that all the AEsir are unjust? Ah, yes. In the beginning of  things they cheated the Giant who built the wall round their City. The  AEsir are unjust.\"    Loki had Andvari in his power. And after the Dwarf had raged against him  and defied him, he tormented him; at last, trembling with rage and with  his face covered with tears, Andvari took Loki into his cavern, and,  turning a rock aside, showed him the mass of gold and gems that was his  hoard.    At once Loki began to gather into the Magic Net lumps and ingots and  circlets of gold with gems that were rubies and sapphires and emeralds.  He saw Andvari snatch at something on the heap, but he made no sign of  marking it. At last all was gathered into the net, and Loki stood there  ready to bear the Dwarf's hoard away.    \"There is one thing more to be given,\" said Loki, \"the ring that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#19)"],[1,"that blends into perfect  harmony the beautiful and useful in life.          CHAPTER XIII.      On my return to college, after the close of vacation, I devoted myself  exclusively to history. It began with their first President; and from  the evidence of history itself, I knew that the Nation was enjoying a  high state of culture when its history began.    No record of a more primitive race was to be found in all the Library,  assiduously as I searched for it. I read with absorbing interest their  progress toward perfect enlightenment, their laborious searchings into  science that had resulted in such marvelous achievements. But earnestly  as I sought for it, and anxiously as I longed for it, I found and heard  no mention of a race of men. From the most intimate intercourse with the  people of Mizora, I could discover no attempt at concealment in  anything, yet the inquiry _would_ crowd itself upon me. \"Where are the  men?\" And as constantly would I be forced to the conclusion that Mizora  was either a land of mystery beyond the scope of the wildest and  weirdest fancy, or else they were utterly oblivious of such a race. And  the last conclusion was most improbable of all.    Man, in my country, was a necessity of government, law, and protection.  His importance, (as I viewed it from inherited ideas) was incalculable.  It _could_ not be possible that he had no existence in a country so  eminently adapted to his desires and ability.    The expression, \"domestic misery,\" that the Preceptress made use of one  day in conversation with me, haunted my imagination with a persistent  suspicion of mystery. It had a familiar sound to me. It intimated  knowledge of a world _I_ knew so well; where ill-nature, malice, spite,  envy, deceit, falsehood and dishonesty, made life a continual anxiety.    Locks, bolts and bars shut out the thief who coveted your jewels; but no  bolts nor bars, however ingeniously constructed or strongly made, could  keep out the thief who coveted your character. One little word from a  pretended friend might consummate the sorrow of your whole life, and be  witnessed by the perpetrator without a pang--nay, even with exultation.    There were other miseries I thought of that were common in my country.  There were those we love. Some who are woven into our lives and  affections by the kinship of blood; who grow up weak and vacillating,  and are won away, sometimes through vice, to estrangement. Our hearts  ache not the less painfully that they have ceased to be worthy of a  throb; or that they have been weak enough to become estranged, to  benefit some selfish alien.    There were other sorrows in that world that I had come from, that  brought anguish alike to the innocent and the guilty. It was the sorrow  of premature death. Diseases of all kinds made lives wretched; or tore  them asunder with death. How many hearts have ached with cankering pain  to see those who are vitally dear, wasting away slowly, but surely, with  unrelievable suffering; and to know that life but prolongs their misery,  and death relieves it only with inconsolable grief for the living.    Who has looked into a pair of youthful eyes, so lovely that imagination  could not invent for them another charm, and saw the misty film of death  gather over them, while your heart ached with regret as bitter as it was  unavailing. The soft snows of winter have fallen--a veil of purity--over  the new made graves of innocence and youth, and its wild winds have been  the saddest requiem. The dews of summer have wept with your tears, and  its zephyrs have sighed over the mouldering loveliness of youth.    I had known no skill in my world that could snatch from death its  unlawful prey of youth. But here, in this land so eminently blessed, no  one regarded death as a dreaded invader of their household.    \"_We cannot die until we get old_,\" said Wauna, naively.    And looking upon their bounding animal spirits, their strong supple  frames, and the rich, red blood of perfect health, mantling their cheeks  with its unsurpassable bloom, one would think that disease must have  strong grasp indeed that could destroy them.    But these were not all the sorrows that my own country knew. Crimes,  with which we had no personal connection, shocked us with their horrible  details. They crept, like noxious vapors, into the moral atmosphere of  the pure and good; tainting the weak, and annoying the strong.    There were other sorrows in my country that were more deplorable still.  It was the fate of those who sought to relieve the sufferings of the  many by an enforced government reform. Misguided, imprudent and  fanatical they might be, but their aim at least was noble. The wrongs  and sufferings of the helpless and oppressed had goaded them to action  for their relief.    But, alas! The pale and haggard faces of thousands of those patriot  souls faded and wasted in torturing slowness in dungeons of rayless  gloom. Or their emaciated and rheumatic frames toiled in speechless  agony amid the horrors of Siberia's mines.    In _this_ land they would have been recognized as aspiring natures,  spreading their wings for a nobler flight, seeking a higher and grander  life. The smile of beauty would have urged them on. Hands innumerable  would have given them a cordial and encouraging grasp. But in the land  they had sought to benefit and failed, they suffered in silence and  darkness, and died forgotten or cursed.    My heart and my brain ached with memory, and the thought again occurred:  \"_Could_ the Preceptress ever have known such a race of people?\"    I looked at her fair, calm brow, where not a wrinkle marred the serene  expression of intellect, although I had been told that more than a  hundred years had touched with increasing wisdom its broad surface. The  smile that dwelt in her eyes, like the mystic sprite in the fountain,  had not a suspicion of sadness in them. A nature so lofty as hers, where  every feeling had a generous and noble existence and aim, could not have  known without anguish the race of people _I_ knew so well. Their sorrows  would have tinged her life with a continual sadness.    The words of Wauna had awakened a new thought. I knew that their mental  life was far above mine, and that in all the relations of life, both  business and social, they exhibited a refinement never attained by my  people. I had supposed these qualities to be an endowment of nature, and  not a development sought and labored for by themselves. But my  conversation with Wauna had given me a different impression, and the  thought of a future for my own country took possession of me.    \"Could it ever emerge from its horrors, and rise through gradual but  earnest endeavor to such perfection? Could a higher civilization crowd  its sufferings out of existence and, in time, memory?\"    I had never thought of my country having a claim upon me other than what  I owed to my relatives and society. But in Mizora, where the very  atmosphere seemed to feed one's brain with grander and nobler ideas of  life and humanity, my nature had drank the inspiration of good deeds and  impulses, and had given the desire to work for something beside myself  and my own kindred. I resolved that if I should ever again behold my  native country, I would seek the good of all its people along with that  of my nearest and dearest of kin. But how to do it was a matter I could  not arrange. I felt reluctant to ask either Wauna or her mother. The  guileless frankness of Wauna's nature was an impassable barrier to the  confidence of crimes and wretchedness. One glance of horror from her  dark, sweet eyes, would have chilled me into painful silence and  sorrowful regret.    The mystery that had ever surrounded these lovely and noble blonde women  had driven me into an unnatural reserve in regard to my own people and  country. I had always perceived the utter absence of my allusion to the  masculine gender, and conceiving that it must be occasioned by some more  than ordinary circumstances, I refrained from intruding my curiosity.    That the singular absence of men was connected with nothing criminal or  ignoble on their part I felt certain; but that it was associated with  something weird and mysterious I had now become convinced. My efforts to  discover their whereabouts had been earnest and untiring. I had visited  a number of their large cities, and had enjoyed the hospitality of many  private homes. I had examined every nook and corner of private and  public buildings, (for in Mizora nothing ever has locks) and in no place  had I ever discovered a trace or suggestion of man.    Women and girls were everywhere. Their fair faces and golden heads  greeted me in every town and city. Sometimes a pair of unusually dark  blue eyes, like the color of a velvet-leaved pansy, looked out from an  exquisitely tinted face framed in flossy golden hair, startling me with  its unnatural loveliness, and then I would wonder anew:    \"Why is such a paradise for man so entirely devoid of him?\"    I even endeavored to discover from the conversation of young girls some  allusion to the male sex. But listen as attentively and discreetly as I  could, not one allusion did I hear made to the mysteriously absent  beings. I was astonished that young girls, with cheeks like the downy  bloom of a ripe peach, should chatter and laugh merrily over every  conversational topic but that of the lords of society. The older and the  wiser among women might acquire a depreciating idea of their worth, but  innocent and inexperienced girlhood was apt to surround that name with a  halo of romance and fancied nobility that the reality did not always  possess. What, then, was my amazement to find _them_ indifferent and  wholly neglectful of that (to me) very important class of beings.    Conjecture at last exhausted itself, and curiosity became indifferent.  Mizora, as a nation, or an individual representative, was incapable of"]]]
