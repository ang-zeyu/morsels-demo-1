DE W., _le 30 Decembre 1845._    SIRE ET MON TRES CHER FRERE,--Votre Majeste me pardonnera si je viens  seulement maintenant vous remercier de tout mon c[oe]ur de votre  lettre si bonne et si aimable du 16, mais vous savez combien j'etais  occupee pendant ces dernieres 3 semaines. La Crise est passee et j'ai  tout lieu de croire que le Gouvernement de Sir R. Peel va s'affermir  de plus en plus, ce que je ne puis que desirer pour le bien-etre du  pays. Je dois cependant dire a votre Majeste que si le Ministere  eut change, j'ai la certitude que le nouveau se serait empresse de  maintenir, comme nous le desirons si vivement, cette entente cordiale  si heureusement etablie entre nos deux Gouvernements.    Permettez-moi, Sire, de vous offrir au nom d'Albert et au mien nos  felicitations les plus sinceres a l'occasion de la nouvelle Annee,  dans lequel vous nous donnez le doux espoir de vous revoir. Nous avons  lu avec beaucoup d'interet le Speech de V.M., dans lequel vous parlez  si aimablement du \"friendly call\" a Eu et des cooperations des 2  pays dans differentes parties du monde, et particulierement pour  l'Abolition de la Traite des noirs.    Ayez la grace, Sire, de deposer nos hommages et nos felicitations aux  pieds de la Reine et de votre S[oe]ur. Agreez encore une fois, les  expressions d'amitie et d'attachement sincere avec lesquelles je suis,  Sire et mon bien cher Frere, de votre Majeste, la bien bonne S[oe]ur  et fidele Amie,    VICTORIA R.          _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _30th December 1845._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind letter of the 27th,  by which I see how glad you are at our good Peel being again--and I  sincerely and confidently hope for many years--my Minister. I have  heard many instances of the confidence the country and _all_ parties  have in Peel; for instance, he was immensely cheered at Birmingham--a  most Radical place; and _Joseph Hume_ expressed great distress when  Peel resigned, and the greatest contempt for Lord John Russell. The  Members of the Government have behaved extremely well and with much  disinterestedness. The Government has secured the services of Mr  Gladstone and Lord Ellenborough,[44] who will be of great use. Lord E.  is become very quiet, and is a very good speaker.    We had a very happy Christmas. This weather is extremely unwholesome.  Now, ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 44: Lord Ellenborough was one of the few      Conservative statesmen of the day who, after remaining      faithful to Sir Robert Peel till the middle of 1846,      subsequently threw in his fortunes with Lord Derby and Mr      Disraeli. He was President of the Board of Control with those      Ministers in 1858 for the fourth time.]          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    TO CHAPTER XV      The closing days of the year 1845 had been marked by startling  political events, and Lord John Russell's failure to form a  Government, and Sir Robert Peel's resumption of office, with Mr  Gladstone substituted for Lord Stanley, were now followed by the  Ministerial measure for the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Embarrassed as  he now was by the attacks of his old supporters, led by Bentinck  and Disraeli, Peel was supported whole-heartedly but in a strictly  constitutional manner by the Queen and the Prince. Amid bitter taunts,  the Premier piloted the measure through Parliament, but on the night  that it finally passed the Lords he was defeated on an Irish Coercion  Bill by a factious combination in the Commons between the Whigs and  Protectionists, and resigned. Lord John Russell on this occasion was  able to form an administration, though he failed in his attempt to  include in it some important members of the outgoing Government.    Thus, owing to the Irish famine, the Tory party which had come into  power in 1841 with a majority of ninety to support the Corn Laws, was  shattered; after Peel's defeat it became clear that no common action  could take place between his supporters in the struggle of 1846  and men like Bentinck and Disraeli, who now became leaders of the  Protectionist party. For the remainder of the year Peel was on the  whole friendly to the Russell Government, his chief care being to  maintain them in office as against the Protectionists.    In India the British army was successful in its operations against the  Sikhs, Sir Harry Smith defeating them at Aliwal, and Sir Hugh Gough at  Sobraon. Our troops crossed the Sutlej, and terms of peace were agreed  on between Sir Henry Hardinge (who became a Viscount) and the Sirdars  from Lahore, peace being signed on 8th March.    On the continent of Europe the most important events took place in the  Peninsula. The selection of husbands for the Queen of Spain and her  sister, which had so long been considered an international question,  came at last to a crisis; the policy of Great Britain had been to  leave the matter to the Spanish people, except in so far as might be  necessary to check the undue ambition of Louis Philippe; and neither  the Queen, Prince Albert, Peel, nor Aberdeen had in any way supported  the candidature of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.    It was common ground that no son of Louis Philippe should marry the  Queen, but both that monarch and Guizot had further solemnly engaged  at the Chateau d'Eu that no son should marry even the Infanta until  the Queen was married and had children. The return of Palmerston to  the Foreign Office, and his mention of Prince Leopold in a Foreign  Office despatch as one of the candidates, gave the King and his  Minister the pretext they required for repudiating their solemn  undertaking. In defiance of good faith the engagements were  simultaneously announced of the Queen to her cousin, Don Francisco  de Asis, and of the Infanta to the Duc de Montpensier, Don Francisco  being a man of unattractive, even disagreeable qualities, and feeble  in _physique_. By this unscrupulous proceeding Queen Victoria and the  English nation were profoundly shocked.    At the same time Queen Maria found some difficulty in maintaining her  position in Portugal. She dismissed in a somewhat high-handed manner  her Minister the Duc de Palmella, and had to bear the brunt of an  insurrection for several months: at the close of the year her arms  were victorious at the lines of Torres Vedras, but the Civil War was  not entirely brought to an end.    In February a Polish insurrection broke out in Silesia, and the  Austrian troops were driven from Cracow; the rising was suppressed by  Austria, Russia, and Prussia, who had been constituted the \"Protecting  Powers\" of Cracow by the Treaty of Vienna. This unsuccessful attempt  was seized upon as a pretext for destroying the separate nationality  of Cracow, which was forthwith annexed to Austria. This unjustifiable  act only became possible in consequence of the _entente_ between  England and France (equally parties to the Treaty of Vienna) having  been terminated by the affair of the Spanish marriages; their formal  but separate protests were disregarded.    There remains to be mentioned the dispute between Great Britain and  the United States as to the Oregon boundary, which had assumed so  ominous a phase in 1845. Lord Aberdeen's last official act was to  announce in the Lords that a Convention, proposed by himself for  adjusting the question, had been accepted by the American President.          CHAPTER XV    1846      _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    BUCKINGHAM PALACE, _23rd January 1846._    The Queen must compliment Sir Robert Peel on his beautiful and indeed  _unanswerable_ speech of last night, which we have been reading with  the greatest attention.[1] The concluding part we also greatly admire.  Sir R. Peel has made a very strong case. Surely the impression which  it has made must have been a good one. Lord John's explanation is  a fair one;[2] the Queen has _not_ a doubt that he will support Sir  Robert Peel.    He has indeed pledged himself to it. He does not give a very  satisfactory explanation of the causes of his failure, but perhaps he  could not do so without exposing Lord Palmerston.    What does Sir Robert think of the temper of the House of Commons, and  of the debate in the House of Lords? The debates not being adjourned  is a good thing. The crowd was immense out-of-doors yesterday, and we  were never better received.        [Footnote 1: The Queen had opened Parliament in person; the      Prime Minister took the unusual course of speaking immediately      after the seconder of the Address, and in his peroration,      after laying stress on the responsibilities he was incurring,      proceeded: \"I do not desire to be Minister of England; but      while I am Minister of England I will hold office by no      servile tenure; I will hold office unshackled by any other      obligation than that of consulting the public interests and      providing for the public safety.\"]        [Footnote 2: He explained that the attitude of Lord Grey made      the difficulties attending the formation of a Whig Ministry      insuperable.]          [Pageheading: EXTENSION OF INDIAN FRONTIER]      _Sir Henry Hardinge to Queen Victoria._[3]    CAMP, LULLIANEE, 24 miles from LAHORE, _18th February 1846._    The territory which it is proposed should be ceded in perpetuity to  your Majesty is a fine district between the Rivers Sutlej and Beas,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#19)"],[1,"Exeter.

About 1174 A.D., Fitzstephen speaks of the London schools and scholars  thus:--I use Pegge's translation, 1772, to which Mr Chappell  referred me,--      \"The three principal churches in London[75] are privileged by    grant and ancient usage with schools, and they are all very    flourishing. Often indeed through the favour and countenance of    persons eminent in philosophy, more schools are permitted. On    festivals, at those churches where the Feast of the Patron Saint    is solemnized, the masters convene their scholars. The youth, on    that occasion, dispute, some in the demonstrative way, and some    logically. These produce their enthymemes, and those the more    perfect syllogisms. Some, the better to shew their parts, are    exercised in disputation, contending with one another, whilst    others are put upon establishing some truth by way of    illustration. Some sophists endeavour to apply, on feigned topics,    a vast heap and flow of words, others to impose upon you with    false conclusions. As to the orators, some with their rhetorical    harangues employ all the powers of persuasion, taking care to    observe the precepts of art, and to omit nothing opposite to the    subject. The boys of different schools wrangle with one another in    verse; contending about the principles of Grammar, or the rules of    the Perfect Tenses and Supines. Others there are, who in Epigrams,    or other compositions in numbers, use all that low ribaldry we    read of in the Ancients; attacking their school-masters, but    without mentioning names, with the old Fescennine licentiousness,    and discharging their scoffs and sarcasms against them; touching    the foibles of their school-fellows, or perhaps of greater    personages, with true Socratic wit, or biting them more keenly    with a Theonine tooth: The audience, fully disposed to laugh,        'With curling nose ingeminate the peals.'\"    Of the sports of the boys, Fitzstephen gives a long description. On  Shrove-Tuesday, each boy brought his fighting cock to his master, and  they had a cock-fight all morning in the school-room.[76] After dinner,  football in the fields of the suburbs, probably Smithfield. Every Sunday  in Lent they had a sham-fight, some on horseback, some on foot, the King  and his Court often looking on. At Easter they played at the  Water-Quintain, charging a target, which if they missed, souse they went  into the water. 'On holidays in summer the pastime of the youths is to  exercise themselves in archery, in running, leaping, wrestling, casting  of stones, and flinging to certain distances, and lastly with bucklers.'  At moonrise the maidens danced. In the winter holidays, the boys saw  boar-fights, hog-fights, bull and bear-baiting, and when ice came they  slid, and skated on the leg-bones of some animal, punting themselves  along with an iron-shod pole, and charging one another. A set of merry  scenes indeed.      \"In general, we are assured by the most learned man of the    thirteenth century, Roger Bacon, that there never had been so    great an appearance of learning, and so general an application to    study, in so many different faculties, as in his time, when    schools were erected in every city, town, burgh, and castle.\"    (Henry's Hist. of England, vol. iv. p. 472-3.)    In the twenty-fifth year of Henry VI., 1447, four Grammar schools were  appointed to be opened in London[77] for the education of the City youth  (_Carlisle_). But from the above lists it will be seen that Grammar  Schools had not much to do with the education of our nobility and gentry  before 1450 A.D.        [Headnote: AN ETON BOY IN A.D. 1478.]    Of Eton studies, the Paston Letters notice only Latin versifying, but  they show us a young man supposed to be nineteen, still at school,  having a smart pair of breeches for holy days, falling in love, eating  figs and raisins, proposing to come up to London for a day or two's  holiday or lark to his elder brother's, and having 8d. sent him in a  letter to buy a pair of slippers with. William Paston, a younger brother  of John's, when about nineteen years old, and studying at Eton, writes  on Nov. 7, 1478, to thank his brother for a noble in gold, and says,      \"my creanser (creditor) Master Thomas (Stevenson) heartily    recommendeth him to you, and he prayeth you to send him some money    for my commons, for he saith ye be twenty shillings in his debt,    for a month was to pay for when he had money last; also I beseech    you to send me a hose cloth, one for the holy days of some colour,    and another for working days (how coarse soever it be, it maketh    no matter), and a stomacher and two shirts, and a pair of    slippers: and if it like you that I may come with Alweder by    water\"--would they take a pair-oar and pull down? (the figs and    raisins came up by a barge;)--\"and sport me with you at London a    day or two this term-time, then ye may let all this be till the    time that I come, and then I will tell you when I shall be ready    to come from Eton by the grace of God, who have you in his    keeping.\" _Paston Letters_, modernised, vol. 2, p. 129.    This is the first letter; the second one about the figs, raisins, and  love-making (dated 23 Feb. 1478-9) is given at vol. ii. p. 122-3.    Tusser, who was seized as a Singing boy for the King's Chapel, lets us  know that he got well birched at Eton.      \"From Paul's I went · to Eton sent    To learn straightways · the Latin phrase    When fifty-three · stripes given to me          At once I had:      For fault but small · or none at all    It come to pass · thus beat I was.    See, Udall,[78] see · the mercy of thee          To me poor lad!\"    I was rather surprised to find no mention of any Eton men in the first  vol. of Wood's _Athenæ Oxonienses_ (ed. Bliss) except two, who had first  taken degrees at Cambridge, Robert Aldrich and William Alley, the latter  admitted at Cambridge 1528 (Wood, p. 375, col. 2). Plenty of London men  are named in Wood, vol. 1. No doubt in early times the Eton men went to  their own foundation, King's (or other Colleges at) Cambridge, while the  Winchester men went to their foundation, New College, or elsewhere at  Oxford. In the first volume of Bliss's edition of Wood, the following  Winchester men are noticed:      p. 30, col. 2, William Grocyn, educated in grammaticals in Wykeham's      school near Winchester.      p. 78, col. 2, William Horman, made fellow of New Coll. in 1477.
