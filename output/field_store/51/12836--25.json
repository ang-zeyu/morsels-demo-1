Presently there was a glitter of light amongst the green, and Lydia  pointed.    \"I thought that sort of thing was never done except in comic  newspapers,\" she said, but Jean did not smile. Her eyes were focused on  the point where the unseen observer lay or sat, and she shaded her eyes.    \"Some visitor from Monte Carlo, I expect. People at Cap Martin are much  too respectable to do anything so vulgar.\"    Mr. Briggerland, at a glance from his daughter, slipped into the water,  and with strong heavy strokes, made his way to the shore.    \"Father is going to investigate,\" said Jean, \"and the water really is  the warmest place,\" and with that she fell sideways into the blue sea  like a seal, dived down into its depths, and presently Lydia saw her  walking along the white floor of the ocean, her little hands keeping up  an almost imperceptible motion. Presently she shot up again, shook her  head and looked round, only to dive again.    In the meantime, though Lydia, who was fascinated by the manoeuvre of  the girl, did not notice the fact, Mr. Briggerland had reached the  shore, pulled on a pair of rubber shoes, and with his mackintosh  buttoned over his bathing dress, had begun to climb through the  underbrush towards the spot where the glasses had glistened. When Lydia  looked up he had disappeared.    \"Where is your father?\" she asked the girl.    \"He went into the bushes.\" Mr. Stepney volunteered the information. \"I  suppose he's looking for the Paul Pry.\"    Mr. Stepney had been unusually glum and silent, for he was piqued by the  tactless appearance of the Briggerlands.    \"Come into the water, Marcus,\" said Jean peremptorily, as she put her  foot against the edge of the raft, and pushed herself backward, \"I want  to see Mrs. Meredith dive.\"    \"Me?\" said Lydia in surprise. \"Good heavens, no! After watching you I  don't intend making an exhibition of myself.\"    \"I want to show you the proper way to dive,\" said Jean. \"Stand up on the  edge of the raft.\"    Lydia obeyed.    \"Straight up,\" said Jean. \"Now put both your arms out wide. Now----\"    There was a sharp crack from the shore; something whistled past Lydia's  head, struck an upright post, splintering the edge, and with a whine  went ricochetting into the sea.    Lydia's face went white.    \"What--what was that?\" she gasped. She had hardly spoken before there  was another shot. This time the bullet must have gone very high, and  immediately afterwards came a yell of pain from the shore.    Jean did not wait. She struck out for the beach, swimming furiously. It  was not the shot, but the cry which had alarmed her, and without waiting  to put on coat or sandals, she ran up the little road where her father  had gone, following the path through the undergrowth. Presently she came  to a grassy plot, in the centre of which two tall pines grew side by  side, and lying against one of the trees was the huddled figure of  Briggerland. She turned him over. He was breathing heavily and was  unconscious. An ugly wound gaped at the back of his head, and his  mackintosh and bathing dress were smothered with blood.    She looked round quickly for his assailant, but there was nobody in  sight, and nothing to indicate the presence of a third person but two  shining brass cartridges which lay on the grass.          Chapter XXII      Lydia Meredith only remembered swooning twice in her life, and both  these occasions had happened within a few weeks.    She never felt quite so unprepared to carry on as she did when, with an  effort she threw herself into the water at Marcus Stepney's side and  swam slowly toward the shore.    She dare not let her mind dwell upon the narrowness of her escape.  Whoever had fired that shot had done so deliberately, and with the  intention of killing her. She had felt the wind of the bullet in her  face.    \"What do you suppose it was?\" asked Marcus Stepney as he assisted her up  the beach. \"Do you think it was soldiers practising?\"    She shook her head.    \"Oh,\" said Mr. Stepney thoughtfully, and then: \"If you don't mind, I'll  run up and see what has happened.\"    He wrapped himself in the dressing gown he had brought with him, and  followed Jean's trail, coming up with her as Mr. Briggerland opened his  eyes and stared round.    \"Help me to hold him, Marcus,\" said Jean.    \"Wait a moment,\" said Mr. Stepney, feeling in his pocket and producing a  silk handkerchief, \"bandage him with that.\"    She shook her head.    \"He's lost all the blood he's going to lose,\" she said quietly, \"and I  don't think there's a fracture. I felt the skull very carefully with my  finger.\"    Mr. Stepney shivered.    \"Hullo,\" said Briggerland drowsily, \"Gee, he gave me a whack!\"    \"Who did it?\" asked the girl.    Mr. Briggerland shook his head and winced with the pain of it.    \"I don't know,\" he moaned. \"Help me up, Stepney.\"    With the man's assistance he rose unsteadily to his feet.    \"What happened?\" asked Stepney.    \"Don't ask him any questions now,\" said the girl sharply. \"Help him back  to the house.\"    A doctor was summoned and stitched the wound. He gave an encouraging  report, and was not too inquisitive as to how the injury had occurred.  Foreign visitors get extraordinary things in the regions of Monte Carlo,  and medical men lose nothing by their discretion.    It was not until that afternoon, propped up with pillows in a chair,  the centre of a sympathetic audience, that Mr. Briggerland told his  story.    \"I had a feeling that something was wrong,\" he said, \"and I went up to  investigate. I heard a shot fired, almost within a few yards of me, and  dashing through the bushes, I saw the fellow taking aim for the second  time, and seized him. You remember the second shot went high.\"    \"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Stepney.    \"He was an Italian, I should think,\" answered Mr. Briggerland. \"At any  rate, he caught me an awful whack with the back of his rifle, and I knew  no more until Jean found me.\"    \"Do you think he was firing at me?\" asked Lydia in horror.    \"I am certain of it,\" said Briggerland. \"I realised it the moment I saw  the fellow.\"    \"How am I to thank you?\" said the girl impulsively. \"Really, it was  wonderful of you to tackle an armed man with your bare hands.\"    Mr. Briggerland closed his eyes and sighed.    \"It was nothing,\" he said modestly.    Before dinner he and his daughter were left alone for the first time  since the accident.    \"What happened?\" she asked.    \"It was going to be a little surprise for you,\" he said. \"A little  scheme of my own, my dear; you're always calling me a funk, and I  wanted to prove----\"    \"What happened?\" she asked tersely.    \"Well, I went out yesterday morning and fixed it all. I bought the  rifle, an old English rifle, at Amiens from a peasant. I thought it  might come in handy, especially as the man threw in a packet of  ammunition. Yesterday morning, lying awake before daybreak, I thought it  out. I went up to the hill--the land belongs to an empty house, by the  way--and I located the spot, put the rifle where I could find it easily,  and fixed a pair of glass goggles on to one of the bushes, where the sun  would catch it. The whole scheme was not without its merit as a piece of  strategy, my dear,\" he said complacently.    \"And then----?\" she said.    \"I thought we'd go bathing yesterday, but we didn't, but to-day--it was  a long time before anybody spotted the glasses, but once I had the  excuse for going ashore and investigating, the rest was easy.\"    She nodded.    \"So that was why you asked me to keep her on the raft, and make her  stand up?\"    He nodded.    \"Well----?\" she demanded.    \"I went up to the spot, got the rifle and took aim. I've always been a  pretty good shot----\"    \"You didn't advertise it to-day,\" she said sardonically. \"Then I suppose  somebody hit you on the head?\"    He nodded and made a grimace, but any movement of his injured cranium  was excessively painful.    \"Who was it?\" she asked.    He shrugged his shoulders.    \"Don't ask fool questions,\" he said petulantly. \"I know nothing. I  didn't even feel the blow. I just remember taking aim, and then  everything went dark.\"    \"And how would you have explained it all, supposing you had succeeded?\"    \"That was easy,\" he said. \"I should have said that I went in search of  the man we had seen, I heard a shot and rushed forward and found nothing  but the rifle.\"    She was silent, pinching her lips absently.    \"And you took the risk of some peasant or visitor seeing you--took the  risk of bringing the police to the spot and turning what might have  easily been a case of accidental death into an obvious case of wilful  murder. I think you called yourself a strategist,\" she asked politely.    \"I did my best,\" he growled.    \"Well, don't do it again, father,\" she said. \"Your foolhardiness appals  me, and heaven knows, I never expected that I should be in a position to  call you foolhardy.\"    And with this she left him to bask in the hero-worship which the  approaching Mrs. Cole-Mortimer would lavish upon him.    The \"accident\" kept them at home that night, and Lydia was not sorry. A  settee is not a very comfortable sleeping place, and she was ready for a  real bed that night. Mr. Stepney found her yawning surreptitiously, and  went home early in disgust.    The night was warmer than the morning had been. The _Foehn_ wind was  blowing and she found her room with its radiator a little oppressive.  She opened the long French windows, and stepped out on to the balcony.

BUTTONING.--The tops of tables, sideboards, etc., should not be fixed  with screws in the ordinary way. At the front, screws can be driven  upwards through the top rail, but at the sides and back, buttons should  be employed, as in Fig. 359, so that the top is free to shrink. It is  otherwise liable to split if immovably fixed. The tops of kitchen tables  are usually fixed in this way, to allow for shrinkage.    [Illustration: Fig. 359.--Method of Buttoning a Table Top.]    FRAMES FOR OIL PAINTINGS.--The method of making joints for frames on  which the canvas is stretched for oil paintings is shown at Fig. 360.  They are generally mitred at the corners and fitted with loose wedges.  The four parts of the frame can be held temporarily by a piece of thin  board while the canvas is being tacked to the edges of the frame. In the  accompanying illustrations Fig. 360 shows the action of the wedges when  tightening up the frame, the result being to open the mitre joint. Fig.  361 shows the position of the saw cuts for receiving the hardwood wedges.  Note that the parallel groove is carried the full length of the material  for greater convenience in cutting. The other groove is taken from the  outer angle of the mitre joint inwards. The cut finishes with due regard  to the necessary taper; see the dotted lines showing taper in Fig. 360.  The grooves will be wide enough after being cut with an ordinary hand-rip  saw, but for large work they are usually grooved on the circular saw  bench.    [Illustration: Fig. 360., Fig. 361. Joint and Method of Wedging  the Frames of Oil Paintings.]    CORRUGATED STEEL FASTENERS.--It is now many years ago since the steel  saw-edge fastener first appeared on the market, but probably 80 per cent.  of amateur woodworkers have never yet sampled its advantages.    In appearance it resembles a miniature corrugated galvanised sheet such  as is used for roofing purposes, with the exception, however, that the  corrugations are divergent instead of being parallel and that one end is  ground down to a cutting edge (see Fig. 363, A). They are made in various  sizes from 1/4 in. to 1 in. in length, whilst in regard to width they are  classed by the number of corrugations and not by their measurement.    [Illustration: Fig. 362.--Jointing Boards.]    [Illustration: Fig. 363.--Jointing a Frame.]    [Illustration: The Use of Saw-edge Corrugated Steel Fasteners.]    To use the fastener no special tools are required; it is simply driven in  with a hammer exactly as though it were a nail; once in position,  however, to get it out is worse than drawing teeth. The corrugations add  to the strength of the device, the wood fibres closing around them, age  and rust but emphasising their grip.    WALL PLUGS.--At Fig. 364 four types of wall plugs are shown: _a_, the  ordinary rectangular tapered wall plug to drive between the joints of the  brickwork; _b_, the circular tapered wall plug as used to plug a wall  after a star-shaped brick drill has been used; _d_, a twisted wall plug  used for similar purposes to the wedge _a_, but considered to be  superior in holding power owing to its twisted formation; _c_ is another  type of wall plug considered to have great tenacity by reason of its  corrugations. Wall plugs are required in nearly all cases where it is  necessary to joint woodwork to brickwork, as, for instance,  heavily-framed silvered mirrors to the walls of shops.    [Illustration: Fig. 364.--Wall Plugs, Four Varieties.]    [Illustration: Fig. 365.--Slot Screwing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 366.--Slot Screwing a Bracket.]    SLOT SCREWING, OR KEYHOLE SCREWING, is a most useful way of joining light  woodwork in such a manner that the fixing method is not exposed to the  eye. A stout screw is inserted to within 3/8 in. of the head, as at Fig.  365. In the adjoining piece a hole is bored with a centre bit and a slot  is cut with an 1/8-in. chisel. The two pieces of timber are placed  together, and by sliding the upper piece forward the screw runs up into  the slot or keyhole and secures the joint. Fig. 366 shows the application  of the joint fixing a shaped bracket to the shaped shelf; the bracket and  shelf are inverted in the illustration to clearly show the method of  jointing. For heavy work special brass plates are obtainable for this  purpose; one plate is let flush into the upper piece and the other plate  into the lower piece.    Battening (Fig. 367).--A good method of joining cross battens to drawing  boards and other wide surfaces is shown here. After boring for the  screws, slots are cut so as to allow the screws to move along the slots  when shrinkage takes place. In Fig. 368 a similar method is applied to  secure the drawer bottom to the drawer back. If shrinkage takes place in  the drawer bottom and it leaves the groove in the drawer front, the  screws are slackened, the drawer bottom is knocked up into the groove,  and the screws again inserted. For drawing boards, etc., specially made  elliptical-shaped slotted brass socket cups are made to receive the screw  heads.    [Illustration: Fig. 367.--Battening.]    [Illustration: Fig. 368.--Drawer Bottom Joint.]          PUZZLE JOINTS      Puzzle Joints are not only interesting in themselves, but are often  excellent studies in craftsmanship. The majority of them, if to be  satisfactory as puzzles, call for very careful setting out and cutting,  entailing the same degree of skill that is demanded for high-class  cabinet work. For this reason several examples may well find a place in a  volume dealing with woodwork joints. As a rule, these puzzles should be  made in hardwood, such as dark walnut or beech, as in whitewood the  joints are soon liable to wear.    [Illustration: Fig. 369.--Sketch of the Completed Chinese Puzzle.]    CHINESE PUZZLE.--The ingenious puzzle of the Chinese type shown in Fig.  369 is probably older than many of us could guess, but as it is one that  can be made by any woodworker we give full directions as to how it may be  constructed. The complete article may be called, in form, a six-pointed  pyramid. It is made up of twenty-one different pieces, each cut from wood  1/2 in. wide and 1/2 in. thick; 3/8 in. wood may be used if preferred.  For the purpose either sycamore or white maple is the most useful.    [Illustration: Fig. 370., Fig. 371., Fig. 372. The Three Cross  Pieces.]    [Illustration: Fig. 373.--Key Piece.]    The pieces required are as follows:--    Fig. 370.--Six pieces, 3-1/2 ins. long, with a half slot cut in the  centre as shown. This slot must be exactly the width of the wood's  thickness, and cut exactly half way through, so that, if two pieces are  placed across by means of the halved joint, their surfaces will be flush.  The slot must also be exactly in the centre.    Fig. 371.--Six pieces, size 2-1/2 ins. long, with a half-cut centre slot  similar to that of Fig. 370.    Fig. 372.--Six required, these being 1-1/2 ins. in length, and with slots  in the middle as before.    Fig. 373.--One of these last six requires special treatment, as it forms  the key block of the puzzle. After its slot has been cut, one half of the  narrow part must be sawn away, as shown in Fig. 373. The inner edge must  also be gently rounded. The special use of this vital piece, which we  will call the \"key,\" will be fully explained presently.    Fig. 374.--Then, in addition to these, there are three central bars to  make. Like the other parts they are 1/2 in. by 1/2 in., but are each  4-1/2 ins. long, and are cut as shown in Fig. 374. The end projections  _a_ are 1/2 in. long, and the cut-away part is exactly half the depth of  the wood. Two of the three pieces (X and Y in Fig. 374) are similar, but  the slot _b_ of the third one (Z) is only 1/4 in. wide instead of 1/2 in.  As will be noticed, this 1/4-in. slot is _not_ in the centre, but  corresponds with the right-hand half of the larger slots of X and Y.    [Illustration: Fig. 374.--The Central Bars.]    In making these twenty-one pieces, what should be borne in mind is that  the different parts fit closely into each other. Consequently the slots,  in width, must be cut so as to grip the thickness of the wood; in depth  they must be exactly half this thickness.    FITTING THE PUZZLE.--The three central bars must first be joined, as  those form the skeleton framework of the structure. Fig. 375 shows them  in position, but as it is a puzzle in itself as to how they can be got  thus some explanation is necessary.    [Illustration: Fig. 375.--The Three Central Bars in Position.]    [Illustration: Fig. 376.--How to Adjust the Bars. (Note position of  projecting ends, _a_.)]    FIRST STAGE.--First take the bars X and Y (see Fig. 374) and arrange them  as shown in Fig. 376. It is most important that the projections _a_ of X  face upwards, and that the projections _a_ of Y face towards the centre.  Then take the bar Z and bring it flat into the slot of X. The little slot  of Z, however, must remain _above_ the slot of X. Then slide the bar Y  along to the centre, so that the part lettered _c_ slips into the little  slot of bar Z.    This may seem confusing to read, but it is easy to follow when the pieces  are in one's hand. The result of this rather clever arrangement is that  the six arms of Fig. 375 are all exactly the same length, width, and  thickness. They are also arranged so that in each arm may be clasped one  piece each of Figs. 370, 371, and 372. The three central arms may, of  course, be set up in a different order, and here we have merely chosen  the way that is the most simple to describe and illustrate.    [Illustration: Fig. 377.--Beginning to place on the Cross Pieces.]    [Illustration: Fig. 378.--Placing the Key Piece to overlap end projection  of Central Bar.]    SECOND STAGE.--In the remaining part of the work the chief difficulty is  to keep the puzzle from falling to pieces before the key finally locks  it.
