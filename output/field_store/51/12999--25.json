The queen was so much taken up with the sight of Lord Lindsay of Byres,  that it was only just as the boat reached the shore that she glanced at  his companion and recognised Robert Melville: this was some consolation,  for, whatever might happen, she knew that she should find in him if not  ostensible at least secret sympathy. Besides, his dress, by which one  could have judged him equally with Lord Lindsay, was a perfect contrast  to his companion's. It consisted of a black velvet doublet, with a cap  and a feather of the same hue fastened to it with a gold clasp; his only  weapon, offensive or defensive, was a little sword, which he seemed to  wear rather as a sign of his rank than for attack or defence. As to his  features and his manners, they were in harmony with this peaceful  appearance: his pale countenance expressed both acuteness and  intelligence; his quick eye was mild, and his voice insinuating; his  figure slight and a little bent by habit rather than by years, since he  was but forty-five at this time, indicated an easy and conciliatory  character.    However, the presence of this man of peace, who seemed entrusted with  watching over the demon of war, could not reassure the queen, and as to  get to the landing-place, in front of the great door of the castle, the  boat had just disappeared behind the corner of a tower, she told Mary  Seyton to go down that she might try to learn what cause brought Lord  Lindsay to Lochleven, well knowing that with the force of character with  which she was endowed, she need know this cause but a few minutes  beforehand, whatever it might be, to give her countenance that calm and  that majesty which she had always found to influence her enemies.    Left alone, Mary let her glance stray back to the little house in  Kinross, her sole hope; but the distance was too great to distinguish  anything; besides, its shutters remained closed all day, and seemed to  open only in the evening, like the clouds, which, having covered the sky  for a whole morning, scatter at last to reveal to the lost sailor a  solitary star. She had remained no less motionless, her gaze always  fixed on the same object, when she was drawn from this mute  contemplation by the step of Mary Seyton.    \"Well, darling?\" asked the queen, turning round.    \"Your Majesty is not mistaken,\" replied the messenger: \"it really was  Sir Robert Melville and Lord Lindsay; but there came yesterday with Sir  William Douglas a third ambassador, whose name, I am afraid, will be  still more odious to your Majesty than either of the two I have just  pronounced.\"    \"You deceive yourself, Mary,\" the queen answered: \"neither the name of  Melville nor that of Lindsay is odious to me. Melville's, on the  contrary, is, in my present circumstances, one of those which I have  most pleasure in hearing; as to Lord Lindsay's, it is doubtless not  agreeable to me, but it is none the less an honourable name, always  borne by men rough and wild, it is true, but incapable of treachery.  Tell me, then, what is this name, Mary; for you see I am calm and  prepared.\"    \"Alas! madam,\" returned Mary, \"calm and prepared as you may be, collect  all your strength, not merely to hear this name uttered, but also to  receive in a few minutes the man who bears it; for this name is that of  Lord Ruthven.\"    Mary Seyton had spoken truly, and this name had a terrible influence  upon the queen; for scarcely had it escaped the young girl's lips than  Mary Stuart uttered a cry, and turning pale, as if she were about to  faint, caught hold of the window-ledge.    Mary Seyton, frightened at the effect produced by this fatal name,  immediately sprang to support the queen; but she, stretching one hand  towards her, while she laid the other on her heart--    \"It is nothing,\" said she; \"I shall be better in a moment. Yes, Mary,  yes, as you said, it is a fatal name and mingled with one of my most  bloody memories. What such men are coming to ask of me must be dreadful  indeed. But no matter, I shall soon be ready to receive my brother's  ambassadors, for doubtless they are sent in his name. You, darling,  prevent their entering, for I must have some minutes to myself: you know  me; it will not take me long.\"    With these words the queen withdrew with a firm step to her bedchamber.    Mary Seyton was left alone, admiring that strength of character which  made of Mary Stuart, in all other respects so completely woman-like, a  man in the hour of danger. She immediately went to the door to close it  with the wooden bar that one passed between two iron rings, but the bar  had been taken away, so that there was no means of fastening the door  from within. In a moment she heard someone coming up the stairs, and  guessing from the heavy, echoing step that this must be Lord Lindsay,  she looked round her once again to see if she could find something to  replace the bar, and finding nothing within reach, she passed her arm  through the rings, resolved to let it be broken rather than allow anyone  to approach her mistress before it suited her. Indeed, hardly had those  who were coming up reached the landing than someone knocked violently,  and a harsh voice cried:    \"Come, come, open the door; open directly.\"    \"And by what right,\" said Mary Seyton, \"am I ordered thus insolently to  open the Queen of Scotland's door?\"    \"By the right of the ambassador of the regent to enter everywhere in his  name. I am Lord Lindsay, and I am come to speak to Lady Mary Stuart.\"    \"To be an ambassador,\" answered Mary Seyton, \"is not to be exempted from  having oneself announced in visiting a woman, and much more a queen; and  if this ambassador is, as he says, Lord Lindsay, he will await his  sovereign's leisure, as every Scottish noble would do in his place.\"    \"By St. Andrew!\" cried Lord Lindsay, \"open, or I will break in the  door.\"    \"Do nothing to it, my lord, I entreat you,\" said another voice, which  Mary recognised as Meville's. \"Let us rather wait for Lord Ruthven, who  is not yet ready.\"    \"Upon my soul,\" cried Lindsay, shaking the door, \"I shall not wait a  second\". Then, seeing that it resisted, \"Why did you tell me, then, you  scamp,\" Lindsay went on, speaking to the steward, \"that the bar had been  removed?    \"It is true,\" replied he.    \"Then,\" returned Lindsay, \"with what is this silly wench securing the  door?\"    \"With my arm, my lord, which I have passed through the rings, as a  Douglas did for King James I, at a time when Douglases had dark hair  instead of red, and were faithful instead of being traitors.\"    \"Since you know your history so well,\" replied Lindsay, in a rage,\" you  should remember that that weak barrier did not hinder Graham, that  Catherine Douglas's arm was broken like a willow wand, and that James I  was killed like a dog.\"    \"But you, my lord,\" responded the courageous young girl, \"ought also to  know the ballad that is still sung in our time--    \"'Now, on Robert Gra'am, The king's destroyer, shame! To Robert Graham  cling Shame, who destroyed our king.'\"    \"Mary,\" cried the queen, who had overheard this altercation from her  bedroom,--\"Mary, I command you to open the door directly: do you hear?\"    Mary obeyed, and Lord Lindsay entered, followed by Melville, who walked  behind him, with slow steps and bent head. Arrived in the middle of the  second room, Lord Lindsay stopped, and, looking round him--    \"Well, where is she, then?\" he asked; \"and has she not already kept us  waiting long enough outside, without making us wait again inside? Or  does she imagine that, despite these walls and these bars, she is always  queen?\"    \"Patience, my lord,\" murmured Sir Robert: \"you see that Lord Ruthven has  not come yet, and since we can do nothing without him, let us wait.\"    \"Let wait who will,\" replied Lindsay, inflamed with anger; \"but it will  not be I, and wherever she may be, I shall go and seek her.\"    With these words, he made some steps towards Mary Stuart's bedroom; but  at the same moment the queen opened the door, without seeming moved  either at the visit or at the insolence of the visitors, and so lovely  and so full of majesty, that each, even Lindsay himself, was silent at  her appearance, and, as if in obedience to a higher power, bowed  respectfully before her.    \"I fear I have kept you waiting, my lord,\" said the queen, without  replying to the ambassador's salutation otherwise than by a slight  inclination of the head; \"but a woman does not like to receive even  enemies without having spent a few minutes over her toilet. It is true  that men are less tenacious of ceremony,\" added she, throwing a  significant glance at Lord Lindsay's rusty armour and soiled and pierced  doublet. \"Good day, Melville,\" she continued, without paying attention  to some words of excuse stammered by Lindsay; \"be welcome in my prison,  as you were in my palace; for I believe you as devoted to the one as to  the other\".    Then, turning to Lindsay, who was looking interrogatively at the door,  impatient as he was for Ruthven to come--    \"You have there, my lord,\" said she, pointing to the sword he carried  over his shoulder, \"a faithful companion, though it is a little heavy:  did you expect, in coming here, to find enemies against whom to employ  it? In the contrary case, it is a strange ornament for a lady's  presence. But no matter, my lord, I, am too much of a Stuart to fear the  sight of a sword, even if it were naked, I warn you.\"    \"It is not out of place here, madam,\" replied Lindsay, bringing it  forward and leaning his elbow on its cross hilt, \"for it is an old  acquaintance of your family.\"    \"Your ancestors, my lord, were brave and loyal enough for me not to  refuse to believe what you tell me. Besides,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#19)"],[1," says in Psalm 82, where he exhorts judges to  fulfil their charge with absolute rectitude; they being themselves mere  mortals who will one day have to appear before God, the sovereign judge  of the universe, to give an account of their administration. The Lord's  Anointed speaks to you to-day who are sitting in judgment, and says--    \"'God standeth in the congregation of the mighty: He judgeth among the  gods.    \"'How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?    \"'Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.    \"'Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.    \"'I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most  High.    \"'But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.'\"    But this appeal, although convincing and dignified, had no influence  upon the commission; and on the 18th of August the following verdict and  sentence was pronounced:--    \"We have declared, and do hereby declare, Urbain Grandier duly accused  and convicted of the crimes of magic and witchcraft, and of causing the  persons of certain Ursuline nuns of this town and of other females to  become possessed of evil spirits, wherefrom other crimes and offences  have resulted. By way of reparation therefor, we have sentenced, and do  hereby sentence, the said Grandier to make public apology, bareheaded,  with a cord around his neck, holding a lighted torch of two pounds  weight in his hand, before the west door of the church of Saint-Pierre  in the Market Place and before--that of Sainte-Ursule, both of this  town, and there on bended knee to ask pardon of God and the king and the  law, and this done, to be taken to the public square of Sainte-Croix and  there to be attached to a stake, set in the midst of a pile of wood,  both of which to be prepared there for this purpose, and to be burnt  alive, along with the pacts and spells which remain in the hands of the  clerk and the manuscript of the book written by the said Grandier  against a celibate priesthood, and his ashes, to be scattered to the  four winds of heaven. And we have declared, and do hereby declare, all  and every part of his property confiscate to the king, the sum of one  hundred and fifty livres being first taken therefrom to be employed in  the purchase of a copper plate whereon the substance of the present  decree shall be engraved, the same to be exposed in a conspicuous place  in the said church of Sainte-Ursule, there to remain in perpetuity; and  before this sentence is carried out, we order the said Grandier to be  put to the question ordinary and extraordinary, so that his accomplices  may become known.    \"Pronounced at Loudun against the said Grandier this 18th day of August  1634.\"    On the morning of the day on which this sentence was passed, M. de  Laubardemont ordered the surgeon Francois Fourneau to be arrested at his  own house and taken to Grandier's cell, although he was ready to go  there of his own free will. In passing through the adjoining room he  heard the voice of the accused saying:--    \"What do you want with me, wretched executioner? Have you come to kill  me? You know how cruelly you have already tortured my body. Well I am  ready to die.\"    On entering the room, Fourneau saw that these words had been addressed  to the surgeon Mannouri.    One of the officers of the 'grand privot de l'hotel', to whom M. de  Laubardemont lent for the occasion the title of officer of the king's  guard, ordered the new arrival to shave Grandier, and not leave a single  hair on his whole body. This was a formality employed in cases of  witchcraft, so that the devil should have no place to hide in; for it  was the common belief that if a single hair were left, the devil could  render the accused insensible to the pains of torture. From this Urbain  understood that the verdict had gone against him and that he was  condemned to death.    Fourneau having saluted Grandier, proceeded to carry out his orders,  whereupon a judge said it was not sufficient to shave the body of the  prisoner, but that his nails must also be torn out, lest the devil  should hide beneath them. Grandier looked at the speaker with an  expression of unutterable pity, and held out his hands to Fourneau; but  Forneau put them gently aside, and said he would do nothing of the kind,  even were the order given by the cardinal-duke himself, and at the same  time begged Grandier's pardon for shaving him. At, these words Grandier,  who had for so long met with nothing but barbarous treatment from those  with whom he came in contact, turned towards the surgeon with tears in  his eyes, saying--    \"So you are the only one who has any pity for me.\"    \"Ah, sir,\" replied Fourneau, \"you don't see everybody.\"    Grandier was then shaved, but only two marks found on him, one as we  have said on the shoulder blade, and the other on the thigh. Both marks  were very sensitive, the wounds which Mannouri had made not having yet  healed. This point having been certified by Fourneau, Grandier was  handed, not his own clothes, but some wretched garments which had  probably belonged to some other condemned man.    Then, although his sentence had been pronounced at the Carmelite  convent, he was taken by the grand provost's officer, with two of his  archers, accompanied by the provosts of Loudun and Chinon, to the town  hall, where several ladies of quality, among them Madame de  Laubardemont, led by curiosity, were sitting beside the judges, waiting  to hear the sentence read. M. de Laubardemont was in the seat usually  occupied by the clerk, and the clerk was standing before him. All the  approaches were lined with soldiers.    Before the accused was brought in, Pere Lactance and another Franciscan  who had come with him exorcised him to oblige the devils to leave him;  then entering the judgment hall, they exorcised the earth, the air, \"and  the other elements.\" Not till that was done was Grandier led in.    At first he was kept at the far end of the hall, to allow time for the  exorcisms to have their full effect, then he was brought forward to the  bar and ordered to kneel down. Grandier obeyed, but could remove neither  his hat nor his skull-cap, as his hands were bound behind his back,  whereupon the clerk seized on the one and the provost's officer on the  other, and flung them at de Laubardemont's feet. Seeing that the accused  fixed his eyes on the commissioner as if waiting to see what he was  about to do, the clerk said:    \"Turn your head, unhappy man, and adore the crucifix above the bench.\"    Grandier obeyed without a murmur and with great humility, and remained  sunk in silent prayer for about ten minutes; he then resumed his former  attitude.    The clerk then began to read the sentence in a trembling voice, while  Grandier listened with unshaken firmness and wonderful tranquillity,  although it was the most terrible sentence that could be passed,  condemning the accused to be burnt alive the same day, after the  infliction of ordinary and extraordinary torture. When the clerk had  ended, Grandier said, with a voice unmoved from its usual calm--    \"Messeigneurs, I aver in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy  Ghost, and the Blessed Virgin, my only hope, that I have never been a  magician, that I have never committed sacrilege, that I know no other  magic than that of the Holy Scriptures, which I have always preached,  and that I have never held any other belief than that of our Holy Mother  the Catholic Apostolic Church of Rome; I renounce the devil and all his  works; I confess my Redeemer, and I pray to be saved through the blood  of the Cross; and I beseech you, messeigneurs, to mitigate the rigour of  my sentence, and not to drive my soul to despair.\"    The concluding words led de Laubardemont to believe that he could obtain  some admission from Grandier through fear of suffering, so he ordered  the court to be cleared, and, being left alone with Maitre Houmain,  criminal lieutenant of Orleans, and the Franciscans, he addressed  Grandier in a stern voice, saying there was only one way to obtain any  mitigation of his sentence, and that was to confess the names of his  accomplices and to sign the confession. Grandier replied that having  committed no crime he could have no accomplices, whereupon Laubardemont  ordered the prisoner to be taken to the torture chamber, which adjoined  the judgment hall--an order which was instantly obeyed.          CHAPTER XI      The mode of torture employed at Loudun was a variety of the boot, and  one of the most painful of all. Each of the victim's legs below the knee  was placed between two boards, the two pairs were then laid one above  the other and bound together firmly at the ends; wedges were then driven  in with a mallet between the two middle boards; four such wedges  constituted ordinary and eight extraordinary torture; and this latter  was seldom inflicted, except on those condemned to death, as almost no  one ever survived it, the sufferer's legs being crushed to a pulp before  he left the torturer's bands. In this case M. de Laubardemont on his own  initiative, for it had never been done before, added two wedges to those  of the extraordinary torture, so that instead of eight, ten were to be  driven in.    Nor was this all: the commissioner royal and the two Franciscans  undertook to inflict the torture themselves.    Laubardemont ordered Grandier to be bound in the usual manner, I and  then saw his legs placed between the boards. He then dismissed the  executioner and his assistants, and directed the keeper of the  instruments to bring the wedges, which he complained of as being too  small. Unluckily, there were no larger ones in stock, and in spite of  threats the keeper persisted in saying he did not know where to procure  others. M. de Laubardemont then asked how long it would take to make  some, and was told two hours; finding that too"]]]
