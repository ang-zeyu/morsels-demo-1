This took us  through the cantonments and past officers' houses on the low ground,  amongst barracks, and soldiers in khaki and rolled up shirt sleeves,  smoking their pipes under palms and tropic trees; with the lap of Indian  Ocean on the shore to the west, and Bombay on the left and east. This is  not the healthiest or most fashionable quarter. Our officers cannot  afford to take the best bungalows and situations which are towards  Malabar Hill, for the Hindoos and Parsis, who owe their wealth to our  military protection, can buy them out easily. I'd put that right \"If I  were king!\" So our officials and officers have to live where their pay  will let them, in low lying bungalows and expensive flats, or in  hotels. Though not fashionable, it was a pleasant enough drive for us. A  glimpse of the open ocean with the setting sun makes you feel that it is  possible to up anchor and go, sooner or later--somewhere.          CHAPTER XI      Here beginneth another week of observations. To begin with, I purchased  E. H. A.'s \"Tribes on my Frontier,\" feeling that a groundwork of study  in this writer's popular books was necessary before leaving Bombay's  coral strand and adventuring to the interior of this interesting  peninsula. My library increases, you observe. I purchased Holdich's  \"India,\" and I now admit I own a red Baedeker-looking book published by  Murray. With these three I consider I have enough reading matter to make  me pretty \"tired\" in the next three or four months. At home I have only  read bits of \"The Tribes on my Frontier,\" out here everyone has read it;  it is all about bugs and beasts and nature studies, the common beasts  you see here, that no one notices after a time. To-day I timidly  approached one of the ferocious looking animals he writes about. It was  spread out on a window pane in the back premises of the Yacht Club. No  one was looking or I would not have dared to exhibit an interest in such  a common object. It was like this, a dream-like beast, with a golden eye  and still as could be, except that its throat moved (the window and  lizard, are reduced to about one-fifth of life size), and its eye  meditated evil. I ventured to put the end of my stick near it, and it  went off with such alarming speed that I hastily withdrew my stick. It  had vanished into a crack, I'd never have dreamed a small crevice in a  window sash could hold such an extraordinary creature! I must look him  up in \"E. H. A.\"    [Illustration]    Colonel Sir Thomas Holdich's \"India,\" in my humble opinion, is an  absolutely perfect book of reference, of concentrated information on  populations, their origin and characteristics; geology, meterology,  distribution plants with excellent maps printed by Bartholomew; it might  be called scientific, but for the charm of the touches of colour the  whole way through.    The Murrays' book is very useful, but so dry that you hardly care to  open it except in emergency. It has many references to the times of the  Conquest of India and the Mutiny, and the editor, an Englishman or  Anglicised Scot, frequently gives the names of individuals, soldiers and  private people, who distinguished themselves in these times. For  example, at the Siege of Seringapatam, where he mentions such well-known  names as Baillie, Baird, Campbell, and M'Donald, two-thirds the names of  my countrymen, and he calls them \"English!\" which makes me think of Neil  Munro's skipper of \"The Vital Spark\" and his remark about his Mate, \"He  wass a perfect shentleman, he would neffer hurt your feelings unless he  was trying.\" Writers in the days of the Mutiny wrote of the feats of the  \"British troops,\" their gallantry, and all the rest of it; look up _The  Illustrated London News_ of that time, and you will see this is true.  Why--confound them all--do they talk of \"English\" to-day, when they  refer to Scots, Irish, and Englishmen, and the people of our Colonies;  is it merely casual, or a deliberate breaking of the terms of Union of  1707? Eitherway the effect tends to dis-union, it is ante-Imperial and  for Home Rule for \"A Little England.\" Ahem--may that pass as a  \"digression?\"--Now for more nature studies. I saw in the Crawford market  this afternoon fresh fish, and dried and unfresh, and the vendors  thereof. There were many kinds of so-called fresh fish, but the most  were dried, to mere skin and bone, sharks and sprats, piled in baskets  or hanging in bundles. Diminutive wrinkled women sat on little bits of  wet mat in rows, and chopped the \"fresh\" fish into little morsels with  little choppers by the light of little cruisie oil lamps, that flickered  and smoked beside them, and lit up their puckered little chocolate  faces, glinted on their teeth and gums scarlet with betel, and threw  warm lights on the customers faces, who leant forward to close range and  haggled, and, I daresay, said the fish wasn't fresh--and if they had  asked me, I'd have entirely agreed with them. Respectable looking Parsi  men in tight broad cloth coats and shiny black pointed pot hats did this  marketing--not their wives--peered through their spectacles very  carefully, down their long noses at each little chunk. I hoped they  could smell no better than they could see; and the grotesque little  women slipped the minute coppers they secured under the damp mat on the  wet stones between their feet. That was all very poor and small and  sordid, but the grain sellers were pleasant to look at. They sat in nice  clean booths, with around them an endless variety of neat sacks and  bowls displaying all kinds of rice and corn and lentils and baskets of  bright chillies and many other dried fruits for curries.    To chronicle some more small beer, I may put down here that we dined  last night at the Yacht Club. The Yacht Club has little to do with  yachting. There are models of one or two native-built boats in the  passages and rooms; these have deep stems and shallow sterns, evidently  meant to wear, rather than to go about. We did not hear of any yachting  going on, why I do not quite know, as I'd have thought The Bay a perfect  place for racing, and with its inlets a rather pleasant cruising ground,  but perhaps the sun makes sailing uncomfortable. There are both lady and  men members. You can live, dress, bath, and entertain your friends, or  be entertained by them, hear music, read papers, write, talk, and walk  about in pretty grounds, all pleasantly, decently, and in order, for it  is all very open and above board. I do wish we could have such clubs at  home, I mean in Edinburgh, instead of our huge dismal men's clubs where  never a lady enters, and food, drink, and politics are the only  recognised interests.    Here you have talk on everything, and music (of a kind), and see pretty  dresses and faces, and when you wish to be lonely, you may be so from  choice, not from necessity. To a good club, two rooms I think are  essential, a gymnasium and a music room; and where out of France can you  find them! The talk, I must say, is principally about one's neighbour,  which is quite right; it is a most enviable trait, that of being  interested in your neighbour and his affairs. Here, too, when you are  tired of people, you can study beasts, they cannot bore you. I think E.  H. A. is of this opinion. I have been reading more of his researches  into animal life, and find that he says he has fathomed the intellect of  a toad; but verily, I cannot believe that! Several of E. H. A.'s  acquaintances have come round me as I scribble here in the verandah. A  brute, a grey crow perched this moment on the jalousies, and let out  that bitter raucous caw, that would waken the Seven Sleepers or any  respectable gamekeeper within a mile; abominable, thieving, cruel brutes  they are, with rooks they should be exterminated by law. Once they were,  in the reign of James the Fourth, I think, for he needed timber for his  fleet. The law was then that if a crow built for three successive years  in a tree, the tree became the property of the Crown. This has not been  rescinded, so _Field_ please note and agitate in your country and save  your beloved partridges and the eggs of our grouse. Now two green  parroquets have gone shrieking joyfully past. I suppose I must believe  they are wild, but it takes faith to believe they have not just escaped  from a cage; they are uncommonly pretty colour, at any rate, against the  blue and white sky; they have taken the same flight at the same time  these last three days, and a dove is cooing near, a deliciously  soothing sound. Persians say it cannot remember the last part of its  lost lover's name, so that is why it always stops in the middle of the  co-coo, co--    As it grew to twilight I went over to the Bundar and studied reflections  in the calm, lapping water at the steps where so many dignitaries have  arrived and departed, and made notes of the colours of the dark stone  work and pier lamps against the evening glow and the reflections of  boats' lights waggling in the smooth water.    ... A launch bustles in from the _Renown_ and brings up quickly--a white  light between her two brass funnels and green and red side lights. The  red light glows on the bare arm of the jack tar at the bow with the  boat-hook, and just touches the white draperies of the native passenger  as he gets out awkwardly and goes up the steps--a person of importance  with attendants, I see, as they come up into the full acetylene light on  the quay head, someone very princely to judge by his turban and  waist--but a native's waist measurement sometimes only indicates his  financial position.    There is considerable variety of type and nationality amongst the few  people who sit taking the air on the stone parapet of the Bundar. On my  right are two soldiers--one an _Argyll and Sutherland_, with red and  white diced hose and tasselled sporran, a native of Fife to judge by his  accent; next him there is a _Yorkshire "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#19)"],[1,"blood of the atonement can  never, never reach! Father, this is an awful thing, and beyond my  comprehension.\"    \"While we are in the world, we must mix with the inhabitants thereof,\"  said he; \"and the stains which adhere to us by reason of this mixture,  which is unavoidable, shall all be washed away. It is our duty,  however, to shun the society of wicked men as much as possible, lest we  partake of their sins, and become sharers with them in punishment.  John, however, is morally a good man, and may yet get a cast of grace.\"    \"I always thought him a good man till to-day,\" said I, \"when he threw  out some reflections on your character, so horrible that I quake to  think of the wickedness and malevolence of his heart. He was rating me  very impertinently for some supposed fault, which had no being save in  his own jealous brain, when I attempted to reason him out of his belief  in the spirit of calm Christian argument. But how do you think he  answered me? He did so, sir, by twisting his mouth at me, and remarking  that such sublime and ridiculous sophistry never came out of another  mouth but one (meaning yours) and that no oath before a kirk session  was necessary to prove who was my dad, for that he had never seen a son  so like a father as I was like mine.\"    \"He durst not for his soul's salvation, and for his daily bread, which  he values much more, say such a word, boy; therefore, take care what  you assert,\" said my reverend father.    \"He said these very words, and will not deny them, sir,\" said I.    My reverend father turned about in great wrath and indignation, and  went away in search of John, but I kept out of the way, and listened at  a back window; for John was dressing the plot of ground behind the  house; and I hope it was no sin in me that I did rejoice in the  dialogue which took place, it being the victory of righteousness over  error.    \"Well, John, this is a fine day for your delving work.\"    \"Ay, it's a tolerable day, sir.\"    \"Are you thankful in heart, John, for such temporal mercies as these?\"    \"Aw doubt we're a' ower little thankfu', sir, baith for temporal an'  speeritual mercies; but it isna aye the maist thankfu' heart that maks  the greatest fraze wi' the tongue.\"    \"I hope there is nothing personal under that remark, John?\"    \"Gin the bannet fits ony body's head, they're unco welcome to it, sir,  for me.\"    \"John, I do not approve of these innuendoes. You have an arch malicious  manner of vending your aphorisms, which the men of the world are too  apt to read the wrong way, for your dark hints are sure to have one  very bad meaning.\"    \"Hout na, sir, it's only bad folks that think sac. They find ma bits o'  gibes come hame to their hearts wi' a kind o' yerk, an' that gars them  wince.\"    \"That saying is ten times worse than the other, John; it is a manifest  insult: it is just telling me to my face that you think me a bad man.\"    \"A body canna help his thoughts, sir.\"    \"No, but a man's thoughts are generally formed from observation. Now I  should like to know, even from the mouth of a misbeliever, what part of  my conduct warrants such a conclusion.\"    \"Nae particular pairt, sir; I draw a' my conclusions frae the haill o'  a man's character, an' I'm no that aften far wrong.\"    \"Well, John, and what sort of general character do you suppose mine to  be?\"    \"Yours is a Scripture character, sir, an' I'll prove it.\"    \"I hope so, John. Well, which of the Scripture characters do you think  approximates nearest to my own?\"    \"Guess, sir, guess; I wish to lead a proof.\"    \"Why, if it be an Old Testament character, I hope it is Melchizedek,  for at all events you cannot deny there is one point of resemblance: I,  like him, am a preacher of righteousness. If it be a New Testament  character, I suppose you mean the Apostle of the Gentiles, of whom I am  an unworthy representative.\"    \"Na, na, sir, better nor that still, an' fer closer is the resemblance.  When ye bring me to the point, I maun speak. Ye are the just Pharisee,  sir, that gaed up wi' the poor publican to pray in the Temple; an'  ye're acting the very same pairt at this time, an' saying i'  your  heart, 'God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, an' in nae  way like this poor misbelieving unregenerate sinner, John Barnet.'\"    \"I hope I may say so indeed.\"    \"There now! I tauld you how it was! But, d'ye hear, maister. Here  stands the poor sinner, John Barnet, your beadle an' servantman, wha  wadna change chances wi' you in the neist world, nor consciences in  this, for ten times a' that you possess--your justification by faith  an' awthegither.\"    \"You are extremely audacious and impertinent, John; but the language of  reprobation cannot affect me: I came only to ask you one question,  which I desire you to answer candidly. Did you ever say to anyone that  I was the boy Robert's natural father?\"    \"Hout na, sir! Ha-ha-ha! Aih, fie, na, sir! I durst-na say that for my  life. I doubt the black stool, an' the sack gown, or maybe the juggs  wad hae been my portion had I said sic a thing as that. Hout, hout!  Fie, fie! Unco-like doings thae for a Melchizedek or a Saint Paul!\"    \"John, you are a profane old man, and I desire that you will not  presume to break your jests on me. Tell me, dare you say, or dare you  think, that I am the natural father of that boy?\"    \"Ye canna hinder me to think whatever I like, sir, nor can I hinder  mysel.\"    \"But did you ever say to anyone that he resembled me, and fathered  himself well enough?\"    \"I hae said mony a time that he resembled you, sir. Naebody can mistake  that.\"    \"But, John, there are many natural reasons for such likenesses, besides  that of consanguinity. They depend much on the thoughts and affections  of the mother; and it is probable that the mother of this boy, being  deserted by her worthless husband, having turned her thoughts on me, as  likely to be her protector, may have caused this striking resemblance.\"    \"Ay, it may be, sir. I coudna say.\"    \"I have known a lady, John, who was delivered of a blackamoor child,  merely from the circumstance of having got a start by the sudden  entrance of her negro servant, and not being able to forget him for  several hours.\"    \"It may be, sir; but I ken this--an' I had been the laird, I wadna hae  ta'en that story in.\"    \"So, then, John, you positively think, from a casual likeness, that  this boy is my son?\"    \"Man's thoughts are vanity, sir; they come unasked, an' gang away  without a dismissal, an' he canna' help them. I'm neither gaun to say  that I think he's your son, nor that I think he's no your son: sae ye  needna pose me nae mair about it.\"    \"Hear then my determination, John. If you do not promise to me, in  faith and honour, that you never will say, or insinuate such a thing  again in your life, as that that boy is my natural son, I will take the  keys of the church from you, and dismiss you from my service.\"    John pulled out the keys, and dashed them on the gravel at the reverend  minister's feet. \"There are the keys o' your kirk, sir! I hae never had  muckle mense o' them sin' ye entered the door o't. I hae carried them  this three and thretty year, but they hae aye been like to burn a hole  i' my pouch sin' ever they were turned for your admittance. Tak them  again, an' gie them to wha you will, and muckle gude may he get o'  them. Auld John may dee a beggar in a hay barn, or at the back of a  dike, but he sall aye be master o' his ain thoughts an' gie them vent  or no, as he likes.\"    He left the manse that day, and I rejoiced in the riddance; for I  disdained to be kept so much under by one who was in bond of iniquity,  and of whom there seemed no hope, as he rejoiced in his frowardness,  and refused to submit to that faithful teacher, his master.    It was about this time that my reverend father preached a sermon, one  sentence of which affected me most disagreeably. It was to the purport  that every unrepented sin was productive of a new sin with each breath  that a man drew; and every one of these new sins added to the catalogue  in the same manner. I was utterly confounded at the multitude of my  transgressions; for I was sensible that there were great numbers of  sins of which I had never been able thoroughly to repent, and these  momentary ones, by moderate calculation, had, I saw, long ago, amounted  to a hundred and fifty thousand in the minute, and I saw no end to the  series of repentances to which I had subjected myself. A life-time was  nothing to enable me to accomplish the sum, and then being, for  anything I was certain of, in my state of nature, and the grace of  repentance withheld from me--what was I to do, or what was to become of  me? In the meantime, I went on sinning without measure; but I was still  more troubled about the multitude than the magnitude of my  transgressions, and the small minute ones puzzled me more than those  that were more heinous, as the latter had generally some good effects  in the way of punishing wicked men, froward boys, and deceitful women;  and I rejoiced, even then in my early youth, at being used as a scourge  in the hand of the Lord; another Jehu, a Cyrus, or a Nebuchadnezzar.    On the whole, I remember that I got into great confusion relating to my  sins and repentances, and knew neither where to begin nor how to  proceed, and often had great fears that I was wholly without Christ,  and that I would find God a consuming fire to me. I could not help  running into new sins continually; but then I was mercifully dealt  with, for I was often made to repent of them most heartily, by reason  of bodily chastisements received on these delinquencies being  discovered. I was particularly prone to lying, and I cannot but admire  the mercy that has freely forgiven me all these juvenile sins. Now that  I know them all to be blotted out, and that I am an accepted person, I  may the more freely confess them: the truth is,"]]]
