The  Massachusetts man would still boast of the Pilgrim Fathers. The  Virginian still spoke lovingly of the \"Old Plantation.\" But Kentucky and  Tennessee, Ohio and Indiana were children of the Union. They had grown  to statehood within it, and they had no memories outside it. They were  peopled from all the old States, and the pioneers who peopled them were  hammered into an intense and instinctive homogeneity by the constant  need of fighting together against savage nature and savage man. Thus,  while in the older settlements one man was conscious above all things  that he was a New Englander, and another that he was a Carolinian, the  Western pioneer was primarily conscious that he was a white man and not  a Red Indian, nay, often that he was a man and not a grizzly bear. Hence  grew up in the West that sense of national unity which was to be the  inspiration of so many celebrated Westerners of widely different types  and opinions, of Clay, of Jackson, of Stephen Douglas, and of Abraham  Lincoln.    But this was not to take place until the loyalty of the West had first  been tried by a strange and sinister temptation.    Aaron Burr had been elected Vice-President coincidently with Jefferson's  election as President; but his ambition was far from satisfied. He was  determined to make another bid for the higher place, and as a  preliminary he put himself forward as candidate for the Governorship of  New York State. It was as favourable ground as he could find to try the  issue between himself and the President, for New York had been the  centre of his activities while he was still an official Democrat, and  her favour had given him his original position in the party. But he  could not hope to succeed without the backing of those Federalist  malcontents who had nearly made him President in 1800. To conciliate  them he bent all his energies and talents, and was again on the point of  success when Hamilton, who also belonged to New York State, again  crossed his path. Hamilton urged all the Federalists whom he could  influence to have nothing to do with Burr, and, probably as a result of  his active intervention, Burr was defeated.    Burr resolved that Hamilton must be prevented from thwarting him in the  future, and he deliberately chose a simple method of removing him. He  had the advantage of being a crack shot. He forced a private quarrel on  Hamilton, challenged him to a duel, and killed him.    He can hardly have calculated the effect of his action: it shocked the  whole nation, which had not loved Hamilton, but knew him for a better  man than Burr. Duelling, indeed, was then customary among gentlemen in  the United States, as it is to-day throughout the greater part of the  civilized world; but it was very rightly felt that the machinery which  was provided for the vindication of outraged honour under extreme  provocation was never meant to enable one man, under certain forms, to  kill another merely because he found his continued existence personally  inconvenient. That was what Burr had done; and morally it was  undoubtedly murder. Throughout the whole East Burr became a man marked  with the brand of Cain. He soon perceived it, but his audacity would not  accept defeat. He turned to the West, and initiated a daring conspiracy  which, as he hoped, would make him, if not President of the United  States, at least President of something.    What Burr's plan, as his own mind conceived it, really was it is  extremely difficult to say; for he gave not only different but directly  opposite accounts to the various parties whom he endeavoured to engage  in it. To the British Ambassador, whom he approached, he represented it  as a plan for the dismemberment of the Republic from which England had  everything to gain. Louisiana was to secede, carrying the whole West  with her, and the new Confederacy was to become the ally of the Mother  Country. For the Spanish Ambassador he had another story. Spain was to  recover predominant influence in Louisiana by detaching it from the  American Republic, and recognizing it as an independent State. To the  French-Americans of Louisiana he promised complete independence of both  America and Spain. To the Westerners, whom he tried to seduce, exactly  the opposite colour was given to the scheme. It was represented as a  design to provoke a war with Spain by the invasion and conquest of  Mexico; and only if the Federal Government refused to support the  filibusters was the West to secede. Even this hint of hypothetical  secession was only whispered to those whom it might attract. To others  all thought of disunion was disclaimed; and yet another complexion was  put on the plot. The West was merely to make legitimate preparations for  the invasion of Mexico and Florida in the event of certain disputes then  pending with Spain resulting in war. It was apparently in this form that  the design was half disclosed to the most influential citizen and  commander of the militia in the newly created State of Tennessee, Andrew  Jackson, the same that we saw as a mere school-boy riding and fighting  at Hanging Rock.    Jackson had met Burr during the brief period when he was in Congress as  representative of his State. He had been entertained by him and liked  him, and when Burr visited Tennessee he was received by Jackson with all  the hospitality of the West. Jackson was just the man to be interested  in a plan for invading Mexico in the event of a Spanish war, and he  would probably not have been much shocked--for the West was headstrong,  used to free fighting, and not nice on points of international law--at  the idea of helping on a war for the purpose. But he loved the Union as  he loved his own life. Burr said nothing to him of his separatist  schemes. When later he heard rumours of them, he wrote peremptorily to  Burr for an explanation. Burr, who, to do him justice, was not the man  to shuffle or prevaricate, lied so vigorously and explicitly that  Jackson for the moment believed him. Later clearer proof came of his  treason, and close on it followed the President's proclamation  apprehending him, for Burr had been betrayed by an accomplice to  Jefferson. Jackson at once ordered out the militia to seize him, but he  had already passed westward out of his control. The Secretary for War,  who, as it happened, was a personal enemy of Jackson's, thinking his  connection with Burr might be used against him, wrote calling in  sinister tone for an account of his conduct. Jackson's reply is so  characteristic of the man that it deserves to be quoted. After saying  that there was nothing treasonable in Burr's communications to him  personally, he adds: \"But, sir, when proofs showed him to be a Treator\"  (spelling was never the future President's strong point), \"I would cut  his throat with as much pleasure as I would cut yours on equal  testimony.\"    The whole conspiracy fizzled out. Burr could get no help from any of the  divergent parties he had attempted to gain. No one would fight for him.  His little band of rebels was scattered, and he himself was seized,  tried for treason, and acquitted on a technical point. But his dark,  tempestuous career was over. Though he lived to an unlovely old age, he  appears no more in history.    Jefferson was re-elected President in 1804. He was himself doubtful  about the desirability of a second tenure, but the appearance at the  moment of a series of particularly foul attacks upon his private  character made him feel that to retire would amount to something like a  plea of guilty. Perhaps it would have served his permanent fame better  if he had not accepted another term, for, owing to circumstances for  which he was only partly to blame, his second Presidency appears in  history as much less successful than his first.    Its chief problem was the maintenance of peace and neutrality during the  colossal struggle between France under Napoleon and the kings and  aristocracies of Europe who had endeavoured to crush the French  Revolution, and who now found themselves in imminent peril of being  crushed by its armed and amazing child.    Jefferson sincerely loved peace. Moreover, the sympathy for France, of  which he had at one time made no disguise, was somewhat damped by the  latest change which had taken place in the French Government. Large as  was his vision compared with most of his contemporaries, he was too much  soaked in the Republican tradition of antiquity, which was so living a  thing in that age, to see in the decision of a nation of soldiers to  have a soldier for their ruler and representative the fulfilment of  democracy and not its denial. But his desire for peace was not made  easier of fulfilment by either of the belligerent governments. Neither  thought the power of the United States to help or hinder of serious  account, and both committed constant acts of aggression against American  rights. Nor was his position any stronger in that he had made it a  charge against the Federalists that they had provided in an  unnecessarily lavish fashion for the national defence. In accordance  with his pledges he had reduced the army. His own conception of the best  defensive system for America was the building of a large number of small  but well-appointed frigates to guard her coasts and her commerce. It is  fair to him to say that when war came these frigates of his gave a good  account of themselves. Yet his own position was a highly embarrassing  one, anxious from every motive to avoid war and yet placed between an  enemy, or rather two enemies, who would yield nothing to his  expostulations, and the rising clamour, especially in the West, for the  vindication of American rights by an appeal to arms.    Jefferson attempted to meet the difficulty by a weapon which proved  altogether inadequate for the purpose intended, while it was bound to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#19)"],[1,"ion, a  solitary, globose cluster of two to three perfect 1-flowered glabrous  spikelets surrounded by many short spinescent glumes of imperfect ones.  The spikes vary in length from 1 to 2 inches and in breadth from 1/10 to  1/6 inch and are glabrous.    The clusters of _spikelets_ are about 1/4 inch in diameter, often  partially sunk, in a concavity of the rachis; the perfect spikelets are  1/5 to 1/4 inch long and the imperfect are shorter.    [Illustration: Fig. 121.--Trachys mucronata.    A and B. The spikelets; 1, 2 and 3. the first, second and the third  glume, respectively; 4. palea of the third glume; 5 and 6. the fourth  glume and its palea; 7. lodicules, ovary and stamens.]    In the perfect spikelet there are four very unequal glumes. The _first  glume_ is minute, tooth-like, triangular or lanceolate, acute,  nerveless, 1/16 to 1/12 inch long. The _second glume_ is elongate,  linear-lanceolate, acute, sometimes ciliate below the middle,  membranous, narrower than the third glume, hyaline, strongly 3-nerved,  1/16 by 1/6 inch. The _third glume_ is 1/5 by 1/8 inch the largest in  the spikelet, broadly and obliquely ovate or obovate, cuspidately acute,  with nine to many green nerves, paleate; the _palea_ is very small,  about 1/20 inch long, oblong, hyaline and rigidly coriaceous. The  _fourth glume_ is much narrower and shorter than the third glume, linear  oblong, acuminate, chartaceous, smooth, dorsally convex, with incurved  margins, bisexual and paleate; the palea is as long as the glume,  acuminate, hyaline, the margins inflexed below the middle, ovate, acute.  _Lodicules_ are minute or absent. _Stamens_ are three with linear  anthers. _Styles_ are very long with slender stigmas. The grain is  oblong, compressed.    This grass grows abundantly in cultivated dry fields and in the sand  near the sea-shore and it is easily recognized by the clusters of  spikelets in the spike.    _Distribution._--The Deccan Peninsula--both in the interior and on the  sea coast.        14. Tragus, _Haller._    These are annual or perennial grasses, with erect or prostrate stems.  Inflorescence is a spiciform raceme, bearing the spikelets in clusters  of 2 to 4. The spikelets are 1-flowered and usually with two glumes.  Sometimes a very minute hyaline lower glume is present. The first glume  is thickly coriaceous, 5-ribbed, oblong-lanceolate, and ribs with long  recurved spines. The second glume is oblong or oblong-lanceolate,  apiculate, chartaceous, 3-nerved and with a perfect flower; palea is as  long as the glume, 2-nerved. Lodicules are broad, cuneate and fleshy.  There are three stamens. Styles are slender and distinct, with narrow  stigmas exserted from the top of the glume. Grain is oblong to  ellipsoidal free within the glume and its palea.    [Illustration: Fig. 122.--Tragus racemosus.]      =Tragus Racemosus, _Scop._=    This plant is a perennial with tufted prostrate or erect stems, rooting  at the nodes freely and densely leafy. The flowering branches are erect  or geniculately ascending and varies from a few inches to about a foot.    The _leaf-sheath_ is short, pale, glabrous, somewhat compressed,  striate, equitant below and upper are longer, terete and green. The  _ligule_ is only a ridge of short, fine hairs. _Nodes_ are glabrous.    The _leaf-blade_ is convolute when young, ovate or ovate-lanceolate,  variable from 1/4 to 2 inches long and 1/10 to 1/6 inch wide, acuminate,  flat or somewhat wavy, glabrous on both the surfaces, rigidly pungent,  densely crowded and distichously imbricate in the lower part of the  stem, base is amplexicaul, and the margin is distantly serrate and  rigidly ciliate.    The _inflorescence_ is a spike-like terminal panicle varying in length  from 3/4 to 2 inches; the _rachis_ is wavy, slender, angular or grooved,  pubescent, the peduncle is striate, pubescent and enclosed by the  leaf-sheath.    The _spikelets_ are arranged in groups of two, facing each other and  appearing like a single spikelet with two equal echinate glumes,  sessile, or obscurely pedicelled on very short, tumid, pubescent  branches.    [Illustration: Fig. 123.--Tragus racemosus.    1. A pair of spikelets; 2, 3 and 4. the first, second and the third  glume, respectively; 5. palea of the third glume; 6. ovary, anthers and  lodicules.]    There are two (rarely three) _glumes_ in the spikelet. The _first glume_  is very minute, hyaline, obtuse and it is very often not present. The  _second glume_ is about 1/8 inch, ovate-lanceolate, acuminate, strongly  3-ribbed with rows of stout, spreading hooked spines along the ribs and  encloses a single floret. The margins of this glume are membranous and  somewhat scaberulous. The _third glume_ is about 1/12 inch, oblong  lanceolate, membranous minutely hairy, 3-nerved and finely pointed at  the apex; the _palea_ is as long as the glume, hyaline, 2-nerved,  lanceolate, subacute and irregularly toothed at the apex. _Stamens_ are  three, with slender filaments, anthers are short, broad and pale yellow.  The style branches are pale and feathery. _Lodicules_ are two, fleshy  and cuneate or subquadrate. The grain is free inside the glume and the  palea, linear oblong, slightly compressed and pale brown, the embryo  occupies about 1/3 the length of the grain.    This is one of the commonest grasses growing everywhere in tufts with  usually prostrate branches. In some situations the branches are erect.    _Distribution._--Plains of India throughout and Ceylon. It is found in  all the warm regions of the world.        15. Perotis, _Ait._    These are slender annual or perennial grasses with short broad leaves.  Inflorescence is a spike or spiciform raceme. The spikelets are  1-flowered, sessile or shortly pedicelled and jointed. There are three  glumes in the spikelet. The first and the second glumes are empty,  subequal, narrowly linear with a strong midrib which is produced into a  long capillary awn. The third glume is very small, hyaline, lanceolate,  acute, 1-nerved and with a perfect flower; palea is small, narrow,  hyaline and nerveless. Stamens are three with short anthers. Styles are  short and united at the base with very short stigmas. The grain is long  and narrow, longer than the flowering glume.    [Illustration: Fig. 124.--Perotis latifolia.]      =Perotis latifolia, _Ait._=    This grass is an annual with slender leafy stems, branching at the base,  prostrate at first and then geniculately ascending, terminating in  inflorescences and varying in length from 3 to 15 inches.    The _leaf-sheaths_ are glabrous, usually all short except the one next  to the inflorescence which is two or three times as long as the lower  sheaths. The _nodes_ are purple and glabrous.    The _leaf-blade_ is short, 1 to 1-1/4 inches long, ovate or lanceolate,  cordate at base, acute and glabrous on both the surfaces; the margin is  minutely serrate, rigidly ciliate and with a very narrow hyaline border.    The _inflorescence_ is a slender, crinite, spike-like raceme, 1 to 8  inches long, with a finely scabrid main _rachis_.    The _spikelets_ are narrow linear 1/12 to 1/8 inch or longer, purple,  shortly pedicelled and 1-flowered, pedicels are short with a hyaline  swelling on the upper side at the base.    [Illustration: Fig. 125.--Perotis latifolia.    1 and 2. Spikelets; 3, 4 and 5, the first, second and the third glume,  respectively; 6. ovary, stamens and lodicules.]    There are three _glumes_. The _first_ and the _second glumes_ are empty,  narrow-linear, purple, scabrid, 1-nerved and awned; awns are capillary,  varying in length from 1/3 to 1/2 inch. The _third glume_ is very minute  with very small palea. There are three _stamens_ and two small  _lodicules_. _Styles_ are somewhat shorter. The grain is long and  cylindric.    This grass grows in open waste places and in dry fields all over the  Presidency.    _Distribution._--Throughout India.          CHAPTER VIII.    TRIBE IV--ANDROPOGONEAE.      Andropogoneae is a very large tribe with about thirty genera. It is very  well represented in South India and some genera are of very wide  distribution.    The spikelets are usually arranged in pairs at each joint, one sessile  and the other stalked. The spikelets may all be similar as in Imperata  or they may be different as in Ischaemum and Andropogon. There may be  only one flower in the spikelet as in Eremochloa and Saccharum or two as  in Ischaemum and Apocopis. In the genera Polytoca and Coix the spikelets  are unisexual and the male and female spikelets are found in the same  inflorescence, the female being below and the male being continuous with  it. The spikelet nearly always consists of four glumes, the first or the  first and the second being firmer and coriaceous or chartaceous. The  flowering glumes are always shorter than the empty glumes, and are  hyaline. The fourth glume is often awned or reduced to an awn.    The main rachis of the inflorescence is usually jointed at the base. In  addition to this the rachis may be jointed all along its length, so as  to become separated into distinct joints when mature as in Rottboellia,  Saccharum and Andropogon, or it may be continuous as in Imperata. The  pedicels of spikelets and the lower portions of the rachilla of the  spikelets may have long hairs.    Sub. Tribe 1. =Maydeae.=      The spikelets are all unisexual, spicate, the male    and female spikelets are dissimilar, and are on the    same or on different spikes.
