[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#19)"],[1,"  cannon went on without intermission, and the storming was repeated by  regiment upon regiment. Our gallant Lieutenant Pohlman was killed in  this action, and Commandant Philip Oosthuizen was wounded while  fighting manfully against overwhelming odds at the head of his  burghers. An hour before sunset the position fell into the hands of  the enemy. Our loss was heavy--two officers, 18 men killed or wounded,  and 20 missing.    Thus ended one of the fiercest fights of the war. With the exception  of the battle of Vaalkrantz (on the Tugela) our commandos had been  exposed to the heaviest and most persistent bombardment they had yet  experienced. It was by directing an uninterrupted rifle fire from all  sides on the lost \"randje\" that we kept the enemy employed and  prevented them from pushing on any farther that evening.    At last came the final order for all to retire via Machadodorp.          CHAPTER XX.    TWO THOUSAND BRITISH PRISONERS RELEASED.      After the battle of Bergendal there was another retreat. Our  Government, which had fled from Machadodorp to Waterval Station, had  now reached Nelspruit, three stations further down the line, still  \"attended,\" shall I say, by a group of Boer officials and members of  the Volksraad, who preferred the shelter of Mr. Kruger's fugitive  skirts to any active fighting. There were also hovering about this  party half a dozen Hebraic persons of extremely questionable  character, one of whom had secured a contract for smuggling in clothes  from Delagoa Bay; and another one to supply coffee and sugar to the  commandos. As a rule, some official or other made a nice little  commission out of these transactions, and many burghers and officers  expressed their displeasure and disgust at these matters; but so it  was, and so it remained. That same night we marched from Machadodorp  to Helvetia, where we halted while a commando was appointed to guard  the railway at Waterval Boven.    The next morning a big cloud of dust arose. \"_De Engelse kom_\" (the  English are coming) was the cry. And come they did, in overwhelming  numbers. We fired our cannon at their advance guard, which had already  passed Machadodorp: but the British main force stayed there for the  day, and a little outpost skirmishing of no consequence occurred.    A portion of the British forces appeared to go from Belfast via  Dullstroom to Lydenburg, these operations being only feebly resisted.  Our commandos were now parcelled out by the Commandant-General, who  followed a path over the Crocodile River bridge with his own section,  which was pursued by a strong force of Buller's.    I was ordered to go down the mountain in charge of a number of  Helvetia burghers to try and reach the railway, which I was to defend  at all hazards. General Smuts, with the remnant of our men went  further south towards the road leading to Barberton. Early the next  morning we were attacked and again obliged to fall back. That night we  stayed at Nooitgedacht.    The Boer position at and near Nooitgedacht was unique. Here was a  great camp in which 2,000 English prisoners-of-war were confined, but  in the confusion the majority of their Boer guards had fled to  Nelspruit. I found only 15 burghers armed with Martini-Henry rifles  left to look after 2,000 prisoners. Save for \"Tommy\" being such a  helpless individual when he has nobody to give him orders and to think  for him, these 2,000 men might have become a great source of danger to  us had they had the sense to disarm their fifteen custodians (and what  was there to prevent them doing so?) and to destroy the railway, they  would have been able not only to have deprived my commando of  provisions and ammunition, but also to have captured a \"Long Tom.\"  There was, moreover, a large quantity of victuals, rifles, and  ammunition lying about the station, of which nobody appeared to take  any notice. Of the crowd of officials who stuck so very faithfully to  the fugitive Government there was not one who took the trouble to look  after these stores and munitions.    On arrival I telegraphed to the Government to enquire what was to be  done with the British prisoners-of-war. The answer was: \"You had  better let them be where they are until the enemy force you to  evacuate, when you will leave them plenty of food.\"    This meant that there would be more D.S.O's or V.C's handed out, for  the first \"Tommies\" to arrive at the prisoners' camp would be hailed  as deliverers, and half of them would be certain of distinctions.    I was also extremely dissatisfied with the way the prisoners had been  lodged, and so would any officer in our fighting line have been had he  seen their condition and accommodation. But those who have never been  in a fight and who had only performed the \"heroic\" duty of _guarding_  prisoners-of-war, did not know what humanity meant to an enemy who had  fallen into their hands.    So what was I to do?    To disobey the Government's orders was impossible. I accordingly  resolved to notify the prisoners that, \"for military reasons,\" it  would be impossible to keep them in confinement any longer.    The next morning I mustered them outside the camp, and they were told  that they had ceased to be prisoners-of-war, at which they seemed to  be very much amazed. I was obliged to go and speak formally to some of  them; they could scarcely credit that they were free men and could go  back to their own people. It was really pleasant to hear them cheer,  and to see how pleased they were. A great crowd of them positively  mobbed me to shake hands with them, crying, \"Thank you, sir; God bless  you, sir.\" One of their senior officers was ordered to take charge of  them, while a white-flag message was sent to General Pole-Carew to  send for these fine fellows restored to freedom, and to despatch an  ambulance for the sick and wounded. My messenger, however, did not  succeed in delivering the letter, as the scouts of the British  advance-guard were exceedingly drunk, and shot at him; so that the  prisoners-of-war had to go out and introduce themselves. I believe  they were compelled to overpower their own scouts.    Ten days afterwards an English doctor and a lieutenant of the 17th  Lancers came to us, bringing a mule laden with medical appliances and  food. The English medico, Dr. Ailward, succeeded, moreover, in getting  through our lines without my express permission.    Next morning I accompanied an ambulance train to transport the wounded  British to the charge of the British agent at Delagoa Bay. Outside  Nooitgedacht I found four military doctors with a field ambulance.    \"Does this officer belong to the Red Cross?\" I asked.    \"No,\" was the answer, \"he is only with us quite unofficially as a  sympathetic friend.\"    \"I regret,\" said I, \"that I cannot allow this thing; you have come  through our lines without my permission; this officer no doubt is a  spy.\"    I wired at once for instructions, which, when received read: \"That as  a protest against the action of the English officers who stopped three  of our ambulances, and since this officer has passed through our lines  without permission, you are to stop the ambulance and dispatch the  doctors and their staff, as well as the wounded to Lourenco Marques.\"    The doctors were very angry and protested vehemently against the  order, which, however, was irrevocable. And thus the whole party,  including the Lancers' doctor, were sent to Lourenco Marques that very  day. The nearest English General was informed of the whole incident,  and he sent a very unpleasant message the next day, of which I  remember the following phrases:--    \"The action which you have taken in this matter is contrary to the  rules of civilised warfare, and will alter entirely the conditions  upon which the War was carried on up to the present,\" etc.    After I had sent my first note we found, on inspection, some  Lee-Metford cartridges and an unexploded bomb in the ambulance vans.  This fact alone would have justified the retention of the ambulance.    This was intimated again in our reply to General Pole-Carew, and I  wrote, _inter alia_: \"_Re_ the threat contained in your letter of the  ... I may say I am sorry to find such a remark coming from your side,  and I can assure you that whatever may happen my Government,  commandants, and burghers are firmly resolved to continue the War on  our side in the same civilised and humane manner as it has hitherto  been conducted.\"    This was the end of our correspondence in regard to this subject, and  nothing further happened, save that the English very shortly  afterwards recovered five out of the eight ambulances we had retained.          CHAPTER XXI.    A GOVERNMENT IN FLIGHT.      About this time President Steyn arrived from the Orange Free State and  had joined President Kruger, and the plan of campaign for the future  was schemed. It was also decided that Mr. Schalk Burger should assume  the acting Presidentship, since Mr. Kruger's advanced age and feeble  health did not permit his risking the hardships attendant on a warlike  life on the veldt.    It was decided Mr. Kruger should go to Europe and Messrs. Steyn and  Burger should move about with their respective commandos. They were  younger men and the railway, would soon have to be abandoned.    We spent the first weeks of September at Godwan River and Nooitgedacht  Station, near the Delagoa Bay railway, and had a fairly quiet time of  it. General Buller had meanwhile pushed on with his forces via  Lydenburg in the direction of Spitskop and the Sabi, on which General  Botha had been compelled to concentrate himself after falling back,  fighting steadily, while General French threatened Barberton.    I had expected Pole-Carew to force me off the railway line along which  we held some rather strong positions, and I intended to offer a stout  resistance. But the English general left me severely alone, went over  Dwaalheuvel by an abandoned wagon-track,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#19)"],[1,"his face with his hands and  groaned.  It was not as though the speaker were a stranger, in which case  he would have been by now well on in his death by strangulation; he had  known Leonard all his life, and he was a friend of Stephen's.  And he was  speaking truth.    The baleful glitter of Leonard's eyes grew brighter still.  He was as a  serpent when he goes to strike.  In this wise he struck.    'I shall not stop.  I shall go on and tell you all I choose.  You have  called me liar--twice.  You have also called me other names.  Now you  shall hear the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  And if  you won't listen to me some one else will.'  Harold groaned again;  Leonard's eyes brightened still more, and the evil smile on his face grew  broader as he began more and more to feel his power.  He went on to speak  with a cold deliberate malignancy, but instinctively so sticking to  absolute truth that he could trust himself to hurt most.  The other  listened, cold at heart and physically; his veins and arteries seemed  stagnant.    'I won't tell you anything of her pretty embarrassments; how her voice  fell as she pleaded; how she blushed and stammered.  Why, even I, who am  used to women and their pretty ways and their passions and their  flushings and their stormy upbraidings, didn't quite know for a while  what she was driving at.  So at last she spoke out pretty plainly, and  told me what a fond wife she'd make me if I would only take her!'  Harold  said nothing; he only rocked a little as one in pain, and his hands fell.  The other went on:    'That is what happened this morning on Caester Hill under the trees where  I met Stephen Norman by her own appointment; honestly what happened.  If  you don't believe me now you can ask Stephen.  My Stephen!' he added in a  final burst of venom as in a gleam of moonlight through a rift in the  shadowy wood he saw the ghastly pallor of Harold's face.  Then he added  abruptly as he held out his hand:    'Now give me my letter!'    In the last few seconds Harold had been thinking.  And as he had been  thinking for the good, the safety, of Stephen, his thoughts flew swift  and true.  This man's very tone, the openness of his malignity, the  underlying scorn when he spoke of her whom others worshipped, showed him  the danger--the terrible immediate danger in which she stood from such a  man.  With the instinct of a mind working as truly for the woman he loved  as the needle does to the Pole he spoke quietly, throwing a sneer into  the tone so as to exasperate his companion--it was brain against brain  now, and for Stephen's sake:    'And of course you accepted.  You naturally would!'  The other fell into  the trap.  He could not help giving an extra dig to his opponent by  proving him once more in the wrong.    'Oh no, I didn't!  Stephen is a fine girl; but she wants taking down a  bit.  She's too high and mighty just at present, and wants to boss a chap  too much.  I mean to be master in my own house; and she's got to begin as  she will have to go on.  I'll let her wait a bit: and then I'll yield by  degrees to her lovemaking.  She's a fine girl, for all her red head; and  she won't be so bad after all!'    Harold listened, chilled into still and silent amazement.  To hear  Stephen spoken of in such a way appalled him.  She of all women! . . .  Leonard never knew how near sudden death he was, as he lay back in his  seat, his eyes getting dull again and his chin sinking.  The drunkenness  which had been arrested by his passion was reasserting itself.  Harold  saw his state in time and arrested his own movement to take him by the  throat and dash him to the ground.  Even as he looked at him in scornful  hate, the cart gave a lurch and Leonard fell forward.  Instinctively  Harold swept an arm round him and held him up.  As he did so the  unconsciousness of arrested sleep came; Leonard's chin sank on his breast  and he breathed stertorously.    As he drove on, Harold's thoughts circled in a tumult.  Vague ideas of  extreme measures which he ought to take flashed up and paled away.  Intention revolved upon itself till its weak side was exposed, and, it  was abandoned.  He could not doubt the essential truth of Leonard's  statement regarding the proposal of marriage.  He did not understand this  nor did he try to.  His own love for the girl and the bitter awaking to  its futility made him so hopeless that in his own desolation all the  mystery of her doing and the cause of it was merged and lost.    His only aim and purpose now was her safety.  One thing at least he could  do: by fair means or foul stop Leonard's mouth, so that others need not  know her shame!  He groaned aloud as the thought came to him.  Beyond  this first step he could do nothing, think of nothing as yet.  And he  could not take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he  could understand.    And so waiting for that time to come, he drove on through the silent  night.          CHAPTER XIII--HAROLD'S RESOLVE      As they went on their way Harold noticed that Leonard's breathing became  more regular, as in honest sleep.  He therefore drove slowly so that the  other might be sane again before they should arrive at the gate of his  father's place; he had something of importance to say before they should  part.    Seeing him sleeping so peacefully, Harold passed a strap round him to  prevent him falling from his seat.  Then he could let his thoughts run  more freely.  Her safety was his immediate concern; again and again he  thought over what he should say to Leonard to ensure his silence.    Whilst he was pondering with set brows, he was startled by Leonard's  voice at his side:    'Is that you, Harold?  I must have been asleep!'  Harold remained silent,  amazed at the change.  Leonard went on, quite awake and coherent:    'By George!  I must have been pretty well cut.  I don't remember a thing  after coming down the stairs of the club and you and the hall-porter  helping me up here.  I say, old chap, you have strapped me up all safe  and tight.  It was good of you to take charge of me.  I hope I haven't  been a beastly nuisance!'  Harold answered grimly:    'It wasn't exactly what I should have called it!'  Then, after looking  keenly at his companion, he said: 'Are you quite awake and sober now?'    'Quite.'  The answer came defiantly; there was something in his  questioner's tone which was militant and aggressive.  Before speaking  further Harold pulled up the horse.  They were now crossing bare  moorland, where anything within a mile could have easily been seen.  They  were quite alone, and would be undisturbed.  Then he turned to his  companion.    'You talked a good deal in your drunken sleep--if sleep it was.  You  appeared to be awake!'  Leonard answered:    'I don't remember anything of it.  What did I say?'    'I am going to tell you.  You said something so strange and so wrong that  you must answer for it.  But first I must know its truth.'    'Must!  You are pretty dictatorial,' said Leonard angrily.  'Must answer  for it!  What do you mean?'    'Were you on Caester Hill to-day?'    'What's that to you?'  There was no mistaking the defiant, quarrelsome  intent.    'Answer me! were you?'  Harold's voice was strong and calm.    'What if I was?  It is none of your affair.  Did I say anything in what  you have politely called my drunken sleep?'    'You did.'    'What did I say?'    'I shall tell you in time.  But I must know the truth as I proceed.  There  is some one else concerned in this, and I must know as I go on.  You can  easily judge by what I say if I am right.'    'Then ask away and be damned to you!'  Harold's calm voice seemed to  quell the other's turbulence as he went on:    'Were you on Caester Hill this morning?'    'I was.'    'Did you meet Miss --- a lady there?'    'What . . . I did!'    'Was it by appointment?'  Some sort of idea or half-recollection seemed  to come to Leonard; he fumbled half consciously in his breast-pocket.  Then he broke out angrily:    'You have taken my letter!'    'I know the answer to that question,' said Harold slowly.  'You showed me  the letter yourself, and insisted on my reading it.'  Leonard's heart  began to quail.  He seemed to have an instinctive dread of what was  coming.  Harold went on calmly and remorselessly:    'Did a proposal of marriage pass between you?'    'Yes!'  The answer was defiantly given; Leonard began to feel that his  back was against the wall.    'Who made it?'  The answer was a sudden attempt at a blow, but Harold  struck down his hand in time and held it.  Leonard, though a fairly  strong man, was powerless in that iron grasp.    'You must answer!  It is necessary that I know the truth.'    'Why must you?  What have you to do with it?  You are not my keeper!  Nor  Stephen's; though I dare say you would like to be!'  The insult cooled  Harold's rising passion, even whilst it wrung his heart.    'I have to do with it because I choose.  You may find the answer if you  wish in your last insult!  Now, clearly understand me, Leonard Everard.  You know me of old; and you know that what I say I shall do.  One way or  another, your life or mine may hang on your answers to me--if necessary!'  Leonard felt himself pulled up.  He knew well the strength and purpose of  the man.  With a light laugh, which he felt to be, as it was, hollow, he  answered:    'Well, schoolmaster, as you are asking questions, I suppose I may as well  answer them.  Go on!  Next!'  Harold went on in the same calm, cold  voice:    'Who made the proposal of marriage?'    'She did.'    'Did . . . Was it made at once and directly, or after some preliminary  suggestion?'    'After a bit.  I didn't quite understand at first what she was driving  at.'  There was a long pause.  With an effort Harold went on:    'Did you accept?'  Leonard hesitated.  With a really wicked scowl he eyed  his big, powerfully-built companion, who still had"]]]
