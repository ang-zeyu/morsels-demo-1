The same rule which allows perfect  strangers to be agreeably social for an hour, and then part as  strangers yet, certainly will grant to enemies a similar privilege.    The woman who conscientiously, and _perfectly_, hides her personal  animosities rather than mar the harmony of the social circle, is doing  her part to keep the world in tune.    The offer of the social right hand of fellowship is a tacit recognition  of equality.  Hand-shaking is said to be an American habit.  Certainly  the social conditions in a republic are favorable to such a custom.  It  is a pity that a mode so adapted to express the warmth and loyalty of  friendship should be indiscriminately employed in casual greetings.  The pressure of the hand should mean more than it can mean, when, as  now, it is bestowed with equal alacrity on life-long friend and recent  acquaintance.    Fastidious and sensitive people are rather conservative in  hand-shaking.  Etiquette allows considerable latitude.  It is proper  and graceful, but not required, for two men to shake hands when  introduced.  A lady does not usually shake hands with a new  acquaintance, unless the circumstances of the introduction make her  responsible for allowing special cordiality, as when a person is  introduced to her in her own house.  A host and hostess shake hands  with a guest; they may omit to shake hands with the same person when  they meet him elsewhere.    Whatever one's personal impulse, it is polite to defer to the evident  preference of another; and to shake hands heartily if a hand is  cordially extended, or to refrain from proffering the hand when reserve  is evident in the manner of the other person.    Hand-shaking as a conventional ceremony should be as impersonal and as  void of significance as possible.  The clasp of the hand should be firm  but brief; not hasty, yet not prolonged; and the fingers should relax  and loosen their hold at once, not dropping listlessly, nor retaining a  lingering pressure.  When a lady gives her hand to a guest she expects  to get it back again almost immediately, and in an uncrushed condition.  To hold another's hand until he or she is conscious of the detaining  grasp is a liberty that only trusted friends may take.    At the same time, a hearty manner of greeting may be the fashion in  some places; and to meet it otherwise than cheerfully would seem  churlish, according to local standards.  It is always well-bred--as  well as politic--to conform to local customs so far as is consistent  with dignity.    Another custom, gradually going out, is the woman's fashion of kissing  effusively each woman-friend of her acquaintance.  This senseless habit  has no excuse for being.  When kissing is the language of impulsive  affection, etiquette has nothing to say about it except to demand that  the general public shall not be called upon to witness the ceremony.  Public thoroughfares and thronged social assemblies we not the proper  places for such demonstrations.  Nothing is less interesting than other  people's kisses, unless it be the gushing recital of private affairs  with which these unguarded people also entertain every stranger within  earshot.  When scenes like these are observed at railroad stations and  on board of trains when demonstrative leave-taking is in progress, we  may forgive the exhibition since the circumstances warrant more than  usual impulsiveness and forgetfulness of surroundings.  But when the  most common-place meeting of acquaintances, who see each other every  day, is attended with these phenomena, etiquette, as well as  common-sense, enters a severe protest.  The kiss, which should be the  most exclusive symbol of friendship, becomes the most insignificant  form of greeting.    It is not proper, according to strict etiquette, to give the kiss of  greeting in public places; but when near relatives or cherished friends  do choose thus to greet each other, the kiss should be exchanged  unobtrusively and with dignity; conversation on private matters should  be conducted in subdued tones, and a well-bred gravity--quite  consistent with cheerfulness--should characterize the manner.    It would be well if every person in society should register a solemn  resolution never to kiss _anybody_ unless prompted to do so by the  irresistible impulse of affection.  It is safe to say that nine-tenths  of the kisses of social greeting would be dispensed with.  The quality  of the remaining tenth would doubtless be proportionately improved.          BEHAVIOR IN PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES    People understand and \"make allowances\" for many things that, to say  the least, are thoughtless in the behavior of people whom they know  well.  Not so \"the general public,\" which measures every man's conduct  by the strict law of propriety, and accredits him with so much  intelligence and refinement as his manners display--no more.  And,  happily, no less; for this \"general public\" is a dispassionate critic  on the whole, and if it severely condemns our faults, it has no grudge  against us to keep it from equally appreciating our merits.    A \"regard for appearances\" is--and should be--a leading consideration  when ordering one's conduct in public.  It is not enough that _we know_  ourselves to be above reproach; we must take care that the stranger who  observes us gets no impression to the contrary.  Friends who know her  irresistibly mirthful disposition, may excuse the girl who laughs  boisterously on the street-car; but she will not be able to explain to  the severe-looking stranger opposite that she did _not_ do this to  attract attention.    Conduct in public should be characterized by reserve.  The promenade,  the corridors of public buildings--post-office, railway stations,  etc.--the elevators and arcades of buildings devoted to shops and  offices; museums and picture-galleries, the foyer of the theatre, and  the reading-rooms of public libraries may all be regarded as thorough  fares, where the general public is our observant critic.  Greetings  between acquaintances casually meeting in such places should be quiet  and conventional; friends should avoid calling each other by name, and  conversation should be confined to such remarks as one does not object  to have accidentally overheard.  Subdued, but natural, tones of voice  should be used, and the manner should be perfectly \"open and above  board.\"  Cautious whispering is conspicuous, sometimes suspicious, and  always ill-mannered.  If confidential matters are to be discussed, the  office or the parlor is the proper place for the conference.    When acquaintances meet on the promenade, recognitions are exchanged by  a slight bow, with or without a spoken greeting.    On the crowded walk, if two acquaintances pass and re-pass each other  several times in the course of the same promenade, it is not necessary  to exchange greetings after the first meeting.    Canes and umbrellas should not be carried under the arm horizontally,  endangering the eyes and ribs of other pedestrians.    A man, when bowing, lifts his hat in the following instances:    When bowing to a lady.    When, walking with a lady, he bows to another man of his acquaintance.    When bowing to an elderly man, or a superior in office.    When bowing to a man who is walking with a lady.    When, walking with a lady, he joins her in saluting any gentlemen of  her acquaintance, but strangers to himself; or, when walking with  gentlemen, he joins them in saluting a lady of their acquaintance, but  a stranger to himself.    When offering any civility (as a seat in the street-car), to a lady,  whether a stranger or an acquaintance.    When bidding good-bye to a lady after an \"open-air\" conference, when  the hat has been worn.  Punctilious etiquette requires a man to stand  with head uncovered in the presence of ladies, until requested to  replace the hat.  But in our changeable climate, the risk of \"taking  cold\" suggests the good sense of wearing the hat out-of-doors, and  allowing the graceful lifting of the same at greeting and parting to  express all the deference that the uncovered head is meant to symbolize.    The greater the crowd, the shorter the range at which greetings are  exchanged.  One might \"halloo\" to an old acquaintance forty rods  distant, down a country lane; but on Broadway he bows only to the ones  whom he meets point blank.    If two friends meet and pause to shake hands, they should step aside  from the throng, and not blockade the sidewalk.  Ladies should make  these pauses very brief, and beware of entering into exhaustive  interchanges of family news.  Two men may linger, if they choose, and  hold a few moments' conversation.  But if a man meets a lady, and  wishes to chat with her, he should, after greeting her, ask permission  to join her, and walk with her for a short distance; he should by no  means detain her standing on the sidewalk.  He should not accompany her  all the way to her destination, nor prolong such a casual conversation  beyond a few moments.  He should leave her at a corner, and lift his  hat respectfully as he bids her good-bye.    If several people walking together on a sidewalk of average width meet  other groups of promenaders, both parties should fall into single line  as they pass, allowing each group a fair share of the walk.  This is  especially incumbent when on a narrow crossing.  It is very rude for  groups of three or more to walk abreast without heeding the people whom  they meet, and often crowding the latter off the curbstone.  Young  girls are sometimes very thoughtless in this matter.  \"Turn to the  right, as the law directs\" is an injunction that holds good for the  crowded sidewalk.    If one, walking briskly, overtakes slower walkers ahead, and the crowd  allows no space to get past them, one should watch for a chance to slip  through a gap in the phalanx, rather than \"elbow through.\"  If no  chance seems likely to occur, and haste is"]]]
