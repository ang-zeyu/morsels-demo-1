In point of tactics, the battle may be summarized by saying that the  British line held the enemy in front until a couple of detachments, by  daring rushes, had established themselves in positions of command on  the western flank, whence they worked themselves round, crossed the  river, and fairly turned the hostile flank. And that, so stated, is a  very old story. On the other hand, at Belmont and Graspan, at Talana  Hill and Elandslaagte, it was shown that the same arms of rapid fire  {p.161} do not necessarily control where precision and skill, not mere  torrential volume, are needed. Not only is it not demonstrated that  modern weapons can stop the uphill advance of a resolute infantry on  broken ground; it has been shown to probability that they are  incapable of so doing. Whether such charges are wise is one thing, but  whether they are possible is another. Rapidity of fire has reversed  conditions where rapidity is the essential factor; it has not reversed  them, probably not greatly modified them, where skill and resolution  are chiefly demanded.    After the Modder fight Lord Methuen remained at the position then won,  establishing a pontoon bridge, restoring that of the railroad, and  awaiting reinforcements to replace the men lost in battle and those  necessarily detached to protect his lengthening line of  communications. After three severe actions he had now traversed  forty-five of the seventy miles that lay between the Orange River and  Kimberley; but the inadequacy of his numbers was increasingly felt.  During the ten or twelve days at the Modder a serious demonstration  was made in his rear at Enslin, threatening {p.162} the railroad and  his communications. Although successfully repelled, it was evident  that the enemy's concentration had made them so far superior as not  only to increase greatly his task in front, but also to threaten his  rear. \"The longer I remained inactive,\" said he, in his report, \"the  stronger would the enemy become. Therefore, on the day my last  reinforcement arrived, I decided to continue my advance. It was out of  the question to follow the railway, owing to the large kopjes on  either side, which had been strongly entrenched. Besides, by that  route there was not sufficient water.\"    The railroad, after crossing the Modder, runs on the west side of the  river nearly due north for two miles, and then turns north-west for  two more, when it passes between two kopjes, both fortified. The  right-hand one of these, the Magersfontein, extends to the south-east  for three miles, rising there to an abrupt peak about 150 feet high,  which is the key of the situation. In the prolongation of this range a  low ridge covered with brush extends eastward to the Modder, the bed  of which thereabout follows for some distance {p.163} a north-east  and south-west line. At the foot of the peak, but some little distance  in advance, the Boers had dug a line of trenches, which not only  covered the immediate front, but at the eastern end of Magersfontein  sweep round the curve of the hill to the north for some hundred yards,  and then turned east again, following the bushy ridge to the river.  These dispositions facilitated the passage of troops from one flank to  the other under cover, and preserved control of a ford over the Modder  behind the line. The trenches, especially before the peak, were filled  with riflemen. The kopje itself was also manned, but it is allowable  to believe that the experience of the war, already illustrated by many  encounters, must have persuaded so shrewd a fighter as Cronje of the  superior advantage of the trench system. Before the trenches ran a  continuous line of barbed-wire fence. A probable estimate of the  opposing forces places the Boers at 15,000, the British at 11,000. No  certainty can as yet be predicated for the Boer numbers, which depend  upon the enemy's calculations, but that they were decisively superior  is scarcely doubtful.    After {p.164} considering the problem before him, Methuen concluded  that a turning movement was inexpedient. He could not, on the left,  follow the railroad, for that was commanded on both sides. He could  not, on the right, pass between Magersfontein and the Modder, for the  bushy ground would prevent his artillery from helping him to its full  power, and might even place it in danger of capture. If he deflected  still more to the right, crossing the river, he would have to recross  in the face of a force superior to his own in numbers and mobility.  Moreover, in a circuit requiring time, he was hampered by the lack of  transport which then fettered all British movements. He could take  with him provisions for only five days. In any event he must fight  again at Spytfontein; better therefore meet an enemy badly shaken by  such determined assaults as those of Graspan and the Modder.  Therefore, \"I decided to attack the Magersfontein kopje.\" In this the  main effort against the peak was assigned to the Highland Brigade,  under General Wauchope, which had just joined. The force of this  brigade was about 3,000.    On {p.165} the afternoon of Sunday, December 10, the kopjes of  Magersfontein were bombarded heavily, between 4.30 and 6.30 P.M., by a  4.7-inch gun from a distance of 7,000 yards. The Highlanders were  directed to start a half hour after midnight, so as surely to reach  the foot of the kopjes by daylight, due at 3.30 A.M. A drenching rain  came on at 1, lasting through the night and adding greatly to the  difficulty of keeping the direction, which was done by compass. This,  however, was effected, though at the expense of much delay; but the  danger of separating and struggling in the obscurity made it necessary  that the troops should hold a compact formation, and they advanced in  quarter column. The heaviness of the atmosphere postponed daybreak to  4 A.M. A few moments previously General Wauchope had given the order  for deployment on the prearranged plan--one regiment moving ahead, two  others to the right and left respectively, and a fourth forming in  reserve. Some slight delay occurred, owing to local obstacles; and  before the movement had developed, while the troops were still in mass  and {p.166} changing their places, a tremendous fire at two hundred  yards opened from the line of trenches--every rifle apparently  emptying its magazine as rapidly as the finger could handle the  trigger. Coming wholly unexpectedly in the dark, at the critical  moment of a change of formation, great confusion ensued, and  contradictory orders were given, among which the most disastrous  possible, \"Retire,\" is said to have been uttered, causing a certain  number to turn and break through the ranks behind them. In the final  result the brigade, greatly shattered, lay down, and so remained for  several hours.    Meanwhile the remainder of the army, with the exception of a small  flanking force to the left of the Highland Brigade, took position on  its right, prolonging the front in that direction to the Modder; some  companies being thrown to the rear along the course of the river,  guarding the fords against any attack of the enemy upon the right  flank--demonstrations of which were made but repelled. The British  artillery was brought actively and continuously into play, with  perceptible effect upon the enemy's fire. The battle then resolved  itself into {p.167} both parties holding their positions until  nightfall, when the Highland Brigade was withdrawn from the perilous  position in which it had passed fifteen hours of exposure, heat and  thirst. The British slept on the ground, their general purposing next  morning to occupy the kopje, if deserted, but finding the enemy then  still in the trenches, he withdrew his force to the Modder.    The battle of Magersfontein brought Methuen to a standstill, and  postponed for more than two months the relief of Kimberley. The  disaster which befell the Highland Brigade was one of those incidents  which ought not to have occurred, but determination of blame must  await more precise information than is now accessible. To retain the  cover of darkness for an approach made within effective, though long,  range of the enemy's fire--to deploy as near as possible to him, but  still too distant to be seen--to keep 3,000 men in black darkness in  touch, yet not compacted--these are conditions desirable of attainment  but difficult to combine, and, like all combinations, liable to fail  in some element. The total loss, by the last revised returns, was  {p.168} 171 killed, 691 wounded, four-fifths of which fell on the  Highland Brigade and in the first few moments. Among the slain was  General Wauchope.    From the day of this battle until February 11, the opposing forces  continued in the positions occupied by them before the engagement,  Methuen upon the north bank of the Modder, Cronje holding the ranges  at Magersfontein and Spytfontein. The great comparative mobility of  the Boers, with their more numerous and seasoned horses, enabled them  to maintain the investment of Kimberley, and yet retain the power to  concentrate betimes at any threatened point from this interior  position. Here between the two bodies of the enemy, between Methuen  and Kekewich, was the bulk of their army. Kimberley was never  assaulted, nor did the inhabitants often see their enemy in any force.    During the same calendar week as Magersfontein, there occurred two  other reverses--at Stormberg, December 10, and at Colenso, December  15--which made this the black week of the war for the British arms.  These misfortunes, though chargeable in {p.169} part to faulty  dispositions upon the ground, and in part to the chapter of those  accidents which have always to be allowed for in war, serve more  especially to illustrate the embarrassments attendant upon the  division of a force into two or more parts out of reach for mutual  support, and neither one in decisively preponderant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#19)"],[1,"Augusta still returned the same answer, and Schoeneich had to  strengthen his plea. Again he met the guileless Brother Henry, and again  he stormed him with his eloquent tongue.    \"Have you no better answer from Augusta?\" he asked.    \"No,\" replied Brother Henry.    \"My dear, my only Henry,\" pleaded Schoeneich, \"I do so long for a little  chat with Augusta. My heart bleeds with sympathy for you. I am expecting  the King's Commissioners. They may be here any moment. It will go hard  with you poor folk when they come. If only I could have a talk with  Augusta, it would be so much better for you all. But do tell him not to  be afraid of me. I have no instructions concerning him. I will wager my  neck for that,\" he said, putting his finger to his throat. \"I am willing  to give my life for you poor Brethren.\"    The shot went home. As Augusta lay in his safe retreat he had written  stirring letters to the Brethren urging them to be true to their  colours; and now, he heard from his friends in Leitomischl that  Schoeneich was an evangelical saint, and that if he would only confer  with the saint he might render his Brethren signal service, and deliver  them from their distresses. He responded nobly to the appeal. For the  sake of the Church he had led so long, he would risk his liberty and his  life. In vain the voice of prudence said \"Stay!\"; the voice of love said  \"Go!\"; and Augusta agreed to meet the Captain in a wood three miles  from the town. The Captain chuckled. The time was fixed, and, the night  before, the artful plotter sent three of his trusty friends to lie  in wait. As the morning broke of the fateful day {April 25th, 1548.},  Augusta, still suspecting a trap, sent his secretary, Jacob Bilek, in  advance to spy the land; and the three brave men sprang out upon him and  carried him off to Schoeneich. And then, at the appointed hour, came John  Augusta himself. He had dressed himself as a country peasant, carried a  hoe in is hand, and strolled in the woodland whistling a merry tune. For  the moment the hirelings were baffled. They seized him and let him go;  they seized him again and let him go again; they seized him, for the  third time, searched him, and found a fine handkerchief in his bosom.    \"Ah,\" said one of them, \"a country peasant does not use a handkerchief  like this.\"    The game was up. Augusta stood revealed, and Schoeneich, hearing the  glorious news, came prancing up on his horse.    \"My lord,\" said Augusta, \"is this what you call faith?\"    \"Did you never hear,\" said Schoeneich, \"that promises made in the night  are never binding? Did you never hear of a certain Jew with his red  beard and yellow bag? Did you never hear of the mighty power of money?  And where have you come from this morning? I hear you have plenty of  money in your possession. Where is that money now?\"    As they rode next day in a covered waggon on their way to the city of  Prague, the Captain pestered Augusta with many questions.    \"My dear Johannes,\" said the jovial wag, \"where have you been? With  whom? Where are your letters and your clothes? Whose is this cap? Where  did you get it? Who lent it to you? What do they call him? Where does  he live? Where is your horse? Where is your money? Where are your  companions?\"    \"Why do you ask so many questions?\" asked Augusta.    \"Because,\" replied Schoeneich, letting out the murder, \"I want to be able  to give information about you. I don't want to be called a donkey or a  calf.\"    And now began for John Augusta a time of terrible testing. As the  Captain rapped his questions out he was playing his part in a deadly  game that involved the fate, not only of the Brethren's Church, but of  all evangelicals in the land.    For months King Ferdinand had longed to capture Augusta. He regarded him  as the author of the Smalkald League; he regarded him as the deadliest  foe of the Catholic faith in Europe; he regarded the peaceful Brethren  as rebels of the vilest kind; and now that he had Augusta in his power  he determined to make him confess the plot, and then, with the proof he  desired in his hands, he would stamp out the Brethren's Church for once  and all.    For this purpose Augusta was now imprisoned in the White Tower at  Prague. He was placed in the wine vaults below the castle, had heavy  fetters on his hands and feet, and sat for days in a crunched position.  The historic contest began. For two hours at a stretch the King's  examiners riddled Augusta with questions. \"Who sent the letter to the  King?\"[41] they asked. \"Where do the Brethren keep their papers and money?  To whom did the Brethren turn for help when the King called on his  subjects to support him? Who went with you to Wittenberg? For what and  for whom did the Brethren pray.\"    \"They prayed,\" said Augusta, \"that God would incline the heart of the  King to be gracious to us.\"    \"By what means did the Brethren defend themselves?\"    \"By patience,\" replied Augusta.    \"To whom did they apply for help?\"    Augusta pointed to heaven.    As Augusta's answers to all these questions were not considered  satisfactory, they next endeavoured to sharpen his wits by torturing a  German coiner in his presence; and when this mode of persuasion failed,  they tortured Augusta himself. They stripped him naked. They stretched  him face downwards on a ladder. They smeared his hips with boiling  pitch. They set the spluttering mess on fire, and drew it off, skin and  all, with a pair of tongs. They screwed him tightly in the stocks. They  hung him up to the ceiling by a hook, with the point run through his  flesh. They laid him flat upon his back and pressed great stones on his  stomach. It was all in vain. Again they urged him to confess the part  that he and the Brethren had played in the great revolt, and again  Augusta bravely replied that the Brethren had taken no such part at all.    At this the King himself intervened. For some months he had been busy  enough at Augsburg, assisting the Emperor in his work; but now he sent  a letter to Prague, with full instructions how to deal with Augusta. If  gentle measures did not succeed, then sterner measures, said he, must  be employed. He had three new tortures to suggest. First, he said, let  Augusta be watched and deprived of sleep for five or six days. Next, he  must be strapped to a shutter, with his head hanging over one end;  he must have vinegar rubbed into his nostrils; he must have a beetle  fastened on to his stomach; and in this position, with his neck aching,  his nostrils smarting, and the beetle working its way to his vitals, he  must be kept for two days and two nights. And, third, if these measures  did not act, he must be fed with highly seasoned food and allowed  nothing to drink.    But these suggestions were never carried out. As the messenger hastened  with the King's billet-doux, and the Brethren on the northern frontier  were setting out for Poland, Augusta and Bilek were on their way to the  famous old castle of Puerglitz. For ages that castle, built on a rock,  and hidden away in darkling woods, had been renowned in Bohemian lore.  There the mother of Charles IV. had heard the nightingales sing; there  the faithful, ran the story, had held John Ziska at bay; there had many  a rebel suffered in the terrible \"torture-tower\"; and there Augusta and  his faithful friend were to lie for many a long and weary day.    They were taken to Puerglitz in two separate waggons. They travelled by  night and arrived about mid-day; they were placed in two separate  cells, and for sixteen years the fortunes of the Brethren centred round  Puerglitz Castle.    If the Bishop had been the vilest criminal, he could not have been more  grossly insulted. For two years he had to share his cell with a vulgar  German coiner; and the coiner, in facetious pastime, often smote him on  the head.    His cell was almost pitch-dark. The window was shuttered within and  without, and the merest glimmer from the cell next door struggled in  through a chink four inches broad. At meals alone he was permitted half  a candle. For bedding he had a leather bolster, a coverlet and what  Germans call a \"bed-sack.\" For food he was allowed two rations of meat,  two hunches of bread, and two jugs of barley-beer a day. His shirt was  washed about once a fortnight, his face and hands twice a week, his head  twice a year, and the rest of his body never. He was not allowed the  use of a knife and fork. He was not allowed to speak to the prison  attendants. He had no books, no papers, no ink, no news of the world  without; and there for three years he sat in the dark, as lonely as  the famous prisoner of Chillon. Again, by the King's command, he was  tortured, with a gag in his mouth to stifle his screams and a threat  that if he would not confess he should have an interview with the  hangman; and again he refused to deny his Brethren, and was flung back  into his corner.    The delivering angel came in humble guise. Among the warders who guarded  his cell was a daring youth who had lived at Leitomischl. He had been  brought up among the Brethren. He regarded the Bishop as a martyr. His  wife lived in a cottage near the castle; and now, drunken rascal though  he was, he risked his life for Augusta's sake, used his cottage as  a secret post office, and handed in to the suffering Bishop letters,  books, ink, paper, pens, money and candles.    The Brethren stationed a priest in Puerglitz village. The great Bishop  was soon as bright and active as ever. By day he buried his tools in the  ground; by night he plugged every chink and cranny, and applied himself  to his labours. Not yet was his spirit broken; not yet was his mind  unhinged. As his candle burned in that gloomy dungeon in the silent  watches of the night, so the fire of his genius shone anew in those  darksome days of trial and persecution; and still he urged his afflicted  Brethren to be true to the faith of their fathers, to hold"]]]
