We want  a straight man for something that's on, and I think you'll do.\"    \"I'm game,\" said Dick, \"if it's a straight deal.\"    \"Straight as a die,\" replied Solstein or \"Solly,\" as he liked to be  called. \"Let's get along the beach, we can talk there!\"    Pacing along the sands, with no one to hear them but the sea-gulls, and  with his old briar again charged with some real God-fearing cake  tobacco, Sydney heard what it was that was required of him; and there  and then Solly's offer was accepted.    Two days later an expedition, outfitted regardless of expense in  Johannesburg, left Luderitzbucht to carry out a systematic testing of  certain distant diamond-fields recently discovered and acquired by a  local syndicate, and reported to be fabulously rich, so rich that an  extremely large company talked of acquiring them in turn, and those in  the know hinted at a huge flotation.    Money was therefore no object, and the party was both large and well-  equipped. It consisted of a diamond expert acting on behalf of the  Syndicate; another expert acting on behalf of the would-be purchasers,  and, incidentally, to watch the other chap; a financial representative  of either side to watch proceedings; two prospectors, presumably to  watch each other; a learned professor of geology to give an unbiased  report of the fields; and, lastly, Dick Sydney, ostensibly in charge of  the transport, but in reality to watch the whole caboodle of them.    Striking north-east, the expedition almost immediately entered a  practically untraversed desert of barren sand-dunes, waterless, and  both difficult and dangerous to traverse; and their animals drank  nothing for the first two days. On the third, however, guided by the  discovering syndicate's prospector Grosman, and by two stunted little  Bushmen in his employ, they came to a deep water-hole, where the  precious fluid, though \"brak\" (alkaline) and stagnant, was still  plentiful and drinkable, and within working distance of which the  newly-discovered \"fields\" were located. Here the dunes were  interspersed with long narrow \"aars,\" covered with fine gravel and  loose stones, and here and there covered with scrubby vegetation.    Within a few days Sydney had to acknowledge that his first conclusion  that there was not a single honest man in the party besides himself,  was an unjust one, for the harmless and most necessary professor of  geology was a notable exception.    Absorbed in his science, he passed most of his time in his tent poring  over a microscope, taking very little heed, apparently, of what was  going on, and he was obviously without guile and likely to be easily  gulled by even the most transparent roguery. And that the others were  rogues Dick grew more and more convinced, and it would have been hard  to say which of the party he detested the more; Gilderman, the suave  Johannesburg expert, glib, well-dressed and fastidious; Jelder, the  syndicate's expert from the same locality, a rough-voiced, domineering  mining engineer; Zweiter and Spattboom, the \"financial\" men; or Junes  and Grosman, the two prospectors. On the whole, he thought, were he a  free agent, he would have picked a quarrel with each and all of them  for the sake of giving them individually a thrashing, and in that case  the immaculate Gilderman would have been his first choice.    Each and all of them spoke English, and professed that nationality, but  Dick soon decided that, with the possible exception of Junes, what  wasn't German of the party was certainly Jew!    But still to all appearance everything was fair and above-board. The  prospectors would point out the most likely spots to try for diamonds,  the Ovampo boys would be set to work, and almost invariably they found  diamonds. Occasionally one or other of the \"experts\" would suggest a  different spot, and usually these sapient individuals would justify  their reputation by finding diamonds also in these spots.    The syndicate's expert was jubilant, the company's expert apparently  well satisfied, and the professor beamed upon the stones as they came  from the sieve, talked learnedly of their origin and the peculiarities  of the deposit they were found in, and passed a great deal of time in  abstruse calculations as to the probable yield of the fields, based  upon the rich finds they were making, and the genuineness of which he,  obviously, never doubted.    Sydney picked up several small stones himself. The experts were always  finding them, so were the financial agents; yet Dick, though for a time  he could find out nothing to confirm his opinion, was convinced that  the whole thing meant a gigantic swindle. A few words in French between  the experts which they did not expect the \"man in charge of the  transport\" to understand a word here, and a look there, strengthened  this conviction into certainty, but still he had no proof.    Now Dick had heard of, and suffered from, more than one case of  \"salting\" since he first came to Luderitzbucht, and the quantity of  illicit diamonds in the hands of unscrupulous people made such salting  a comparatively easy matter, but if it were being done in this case, it  was certainly being done very thoroughly and artistically and when?    The whole party moved from place to place practically together in fact,  they kept in sight of each other ostentatiously.    It must be done after dark, if at all, and Dick resolved to watch at  night, as soon as he came to that conclusion. That same night, from his  tiny patrol tent, he watched the lights go out one by one, until the  camp lay silent, and apparently every one was asleep. And as time  passed he was nodding himself, when suddenly a shadow stole silently  from the tent occupied by the two prospectors, crossed to the experts'  tent, and disappeared inside. Dick saw the momentary gleam of an  electric torch and heard the tinkle of a bunch of keys, then the form  reappeared, and, with a glance round, passed silently and rapidly out  of sight across the sand-dunes.    Dick followed, the pale light from a waning moon, occasionally peeping  from behind the clouds, making the pursuit an easy one.    After half an hour of rapid walking the man disappeared over a gigantic  dune that Dick had noticed in the distance the previous evening, and  which he had heard marked the position of the next field to be  examined.    More cautiously now, and keeping well away from the man's actual spoor,  Dick crept up the slope, and peered over the crest down the farther  side.    The moon at that moment shone out clearly, and there, not fifty yards  away from him, Dick could see the figure of Grosman the prospector. He  was walking slowly up and down, now and then throwing his arm out with  the action of a sower, and the seeds he sowed sparkled like dewdrops in  the moonlight.    For he was sowing diamonds--salting!        CHAPTER III         Salting! there was no doubt about it.    The prospector to whom the syndicate owning the fields had entrusted  the important task of locating the most likely spots on which to  demonstrate their richness, had with admirable forethought forestalled  that notoriously fickle jade Fortune and brought the diamonds along  himself, before the remainder of the \"testing\" party arrived. To-morrow  the whole caboodle of unbiased individuals, representing both his own  party and the enormously wealthy Jo'burg financiers who were  negotiating for the fields with a view to a big flotation, would come  along as per schedule, and would doubtless be greatly impressed by this  fresh proof of the fields' richness!    Dick lay flat on his face on the warm and accommodating sand-dune, and  watched Grosman for some time: he was prodigal with the diamonds, and  this was undoubtedly destined to be an exceptionally rich field.    \"The question is,\" reasoned Dick, \"how many of these swabs are in this  swindle. Let's see now, it's no good letting my angry passions run away  with me, and jumping on this chap as I'd like to do. I must reason this  out. The other prospector sleeps in the same tent sometimes disagrees  with this chap as to the best place to test. In that case yes! they've  always tried and found in both places. And they sleep in the same tent.  They're both in it. Same with the experts, both in the same tent, and  they keep the diamonds. That's what this swab went to them to-night  for. And Zweiter and Spattboom, well, no one could be honest with faces  like theirs. Blazes! They're all in it, and all this elaborate business  is just to artistically fool the old professor--he's not part of the  swindle, anyway.\"    That was it undoubtedly. The old professor, who, simple as a child in  many things, had yet a name famous the world over; he it was that this  precious crowd of scoundrels were deceiving so elaborately he it was  whose word of the genuineness of the finds would carry weight with the  financiers and when the time became ripe would rope in the guileless  public.    Well, he, Dick, would have to take a hand in it, but it would require  caution; moreover, Solly to whom he owed his job had told him at  parting:    \"We don't want no experience, just you watch all of these blighters and  find out what their game is, and lie low that's all!\"    His diamond sowing finished, Grosman sat down, took off his  veldtschoens and knocked out the sand, loaded up his pipe, and with a  sigh of contentment which the pipeless and tobacco-loving Dick heard  and appreciated, turned back towards the camp.    Luckily Dick old hand on the plains of countries where it is not  considered healthy to be found on the home trail of a man one watches  at night had taken the precaution to crawl aside sufficiently to give  this \"Knave of diamonds\" a wide berth; and he lay inert and silent as  the dead till Grosman was well on his homeward journey, before  following him to a well-earned spell of sleep.    Following the usual routine, the next "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#19)"],[1,"grades results in the greater quietness and docility so highly  valued, necessarily unfits them for active work; pure bred animals  being altogether too sluggish for profitable labor. This temperament  is inseparably connected with their aptitude to fatten and early  maturity, and these both demand abundant and nutritious food beyond  the ability of many to supply and at the same time are incompatible  with the activity of habit and hard service demanded of the working  ox.      The NORTH DEVONS are deemed to be of longer standing than any other of  the distinct breeds of England, and they have been esteemed for their  good qualities for several centuries. Mr. George Turner, a noted  breeder of Devons, describes them as follows:--\"Their color is  generally a bright red, but varying a little either darker or more  yellow; they have seldom any white except about the udder of the cow  or belly of the bull, and this is but little seen. They have long  yellowish horns, beautifully and gracefully curved, noses or muzzles  white, with expanded nostrils, eyes full and prominent, but calm, ears  of moderate size and yellowish inside, necks rather long, with but  little dewlap, and the head well set on, shoulders oblique with small  points or marrow bones, legs small and straight and feet in  proportion. The chest is of moderate width, and the ribs round and  well expanded, except in some instances, where too great attention has  been paid to the hind quarters at the expense of the fore, and which  has caused a falling off, or flatness, behind the shoulders. The loins  are first rate, wide, long and full of flesh, hips round and of  moderate width; rumps level and well filled at the bed; tail full near  the rump and tapering much at the top. The thighs of the cows are  occasionally light, but the bull and ox are full of muscle, with a  deep and rich flank. On the whole there is scarcely any breed of  cattle so rich and mellow in its touch, so silky and fine in its hair,  and altogether so handsome in its appearance, as the North Devon,  added to which they have a greater proportion of weight in the most  valuable joints and less in the coarse, than any other breed, and also  consume less food in its production.    As milkers they are about the same as most other breeds;--the general  average of a dairy of cows being about one pound of butter per day  from each cow during the summer months, although in some instances the  very best bred cows give a great deal more.    As working oxen they greatly surpass any other breed. They are  perfectly docile and excellent walkers, are generally worked until  five or six years old, and then fattened at less expense than most  other oxen.\"    The author of the report on the live stock shown at the exhibition of  the Royal Agricultural Society at Warwick in 1859 (Mr. Robert Smith)  says:    \"Although little has been written on it, the improvement of the Devon  has not been neglected; on the contrary, its breeding has been studied  like a science, and carried into execution with the most sedulous  attention and dexterity for upwards of two hundred years. The object  of the Devon breeder has been to lessen those parts of the animal  frame which are least useful to man, such as the bone and offal, and  at the same time to increase such other parts (flesh and fat) as  furnish man with food. These ends have been accomplished by a  judicious selection of individual animals possessing the wished for  form and qualities in the highest degree, which being perpetuated in  their progeny in various proportions, and the selection being  continued from the most approved specimens among these, enabled the  late Mr. Francis Quartly at length to fully establish the breed with  the desired properties. This result is substantially confirmed by the  statistics contained in Davy's 'Devon Herd-Book.' We have been curious  enough to examine these pedigrees, and find that nine-tenths of the  present herds of these truly beautiful animals are directly descended  (especially in their early parentage) from the old Quartly stock.  Later improvements have been engrafted on these by the Messrs. Quartly  of the present day. The example of various opulent breeders and  farmers in all parts of the country has tended to spread this  improvement, by which the North Devon cattle have become more general  and fashionable. The leading characteristics of the North Devon breed  are such as qualify them for every hardship. They are cast in a  peculiar mold, with a degree of elegance in their movement which is  not to be excelled. Their hardihood, resulting from compactness of  frame and lightness of offal, enables them (when wanted) to perform  the operations of the farm with a lively step and great endurance. For  the production of animal food they are not to be surpassed, and in  conjunction with the Highland Scot of similar pretension, they are the  first to receive the attention of the London West-end butcher. In the  show-yard, again, the form of the Devon and its rich quality of flesh  serve as the leading guide to all decisions. He has a prominent eye,  with a placid face, small nose and elegantly turned horns, which have  an upward tendency (and cast outward at the end) as if to put the last  finish upon his symmetrical form and carriage. These animals are  beautifully covered with silken coats of a medium red color. The  shoulder points, sides, and foreflanks are well covered with rich  meat, which, when blended with their peculiar property of producing  meat of first-rate quality along their tops, makes them what they  are--'models of perfection.' Of course, we here speak of the best-bred  animals. Some object to the North Devon, and class him as a small  animal, with the remark, 'He is too small for the grazier.' In saying  this it should ever be remembered that the Devon has its particular  mission to perform, viz., that of converting the produce of cold and  hilly pastures into meat, which could not be done to advantage by  large-framed animals, however good their parentage.\"    The Devons have been less extensively, and more recently, introduced  than the Short-horn, but the experience of those who have fairly tried  them fully sustains the opinions given above, and they promise to  become a favorite and prevailing breed. The usual objection made to  them by those who have been accustomed to consider improvement in  cattle to be necessarily connected with enlargement of size, is, that  they are too small. But their size instead of being a valid objection,  is believed to be a recommendation, the Devons being as large as the  fertility of New England soils generally are _capable of feeding fully  and profitably_.    Their qualities as working oxen are unrivalled, no other breed so  uniformly furnishing such active, docile, strong and hardy workers as  the Devons, and their uniformity is such as to render it very easy to  match them. Without possessing so early maturity as the Short-horns,  they fatten readily and easily at from four to six years old, and from  their compact build and well balanced proportions usually weigh more  than one accustomed to common cattle would anticipate.    The Devons are not generally deep milkers but the milk is richer than  that of most other breeds, and some families, where proper care and  attention have been given to this quality in breeding, yield largely.  It is, however, as a breed for general use, combining beef, labor and  milk, in fair proportion, that the Devons will generally give best  satisfaction, as they are hardy enough to suit the climate, and  cheaply furnish efficient labor and valuable meat.    Farmers, whose ideas upon stock have been formed wholly from their  experience with Short-horns and their grades, have often been  surprised at witnessing the facility with which Devons sustain  themselves upon scanty pasturage, and not a few when first critically  examining well bred specimens, sympathize with the feeling which  prompted the remark made to the reporter of the great English  Exhibition at Chester, after examining with him fine specimens of the  Devons--\"I am delighted; I find we Short-horn men have yet much to  learn of the true formation of animals; their beautiful contour and  extreme quality of flesh surprise me.\"      The HEREFORDS are an ancient and well established breed, and are  probably entitled to be called a race. Little is known with certainty  of their origin beyond the fact that for many generations they can be  traced as the peculiar breed of the county whence they derive their  name. Youatt says that \"Mr. Culley, although an excellent judge of  cattle, formed a very erroneous opinion of the Herefords when he  pronounced them to be nothing but a mixture of the Welsh with a  bastard race of Long Horns. They are evidently an aboriginal breed,  and descended from the same stock as the Devon. If it were not for the  white face and somewhat larger head and thicker neck it would not at  all times be easy to distinguish between a heavy Devon and a light  Hereford.\"    Mr. Gisborne says \"The Hereford brings good evidence that he is the  British representative of a widely diffused and ancient race. The most  uniform drove of oxen which we ever saw, consisted of five hundred  from the Ukraine. They had white faces, upward horns and tawny bodies.  Placed in Hereford, Leicester or Northampton markets, they would have  puzzled the graziers as to the land of their nativity; but no one  would have hesitated to pronounce that they were rough Herefords.\"    Mr. Rowlandson, in his prize report on the farming of Herefordshire,  says \"The Herefords, or as they have sometimes been termed, the middle  horned cattle have ever been esteemed a most valuable breed, and when  housed from the inclemency of the weather, probably put on more meat  and fat in proportion to the food consumed, than any other variety.  They are not so hardy as the North Devon cattle, "]]]
