Z., because the other initials were P-I-N-H-E-A-D;  and that spelled 'pinhead,' which was a reflection on my intelligence.\"    \"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,  sympathetically. \"But didn't you cut it almost too short?\"    \"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard. \"When a young man I ran away from home  and joined a circus. I used to call myself a Wizard, and do tricks of  ventriloquism.\"    \"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess.    \"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that the  object was speaking instead of me. Also I began to make balloon  ascensions. On my balloon and on all the other articles I used in the  circus I painted the two initials: 'O. Z.', to show that those things  belonged to me.    \"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts  to this beautiful country. When the people saw me come from the sky they  naturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. I  told them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazed  them; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they called  me Oz.\"    \"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling.    \"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup while  talking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one of  the four being ruled by a Witch. But the people thought my power was  greater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought so  too, for they never dared oppose me. I ordered the Emerald City to be  built just where the four countries cornered together, and when it was  completed I announced myself the Ruler of the Land of Oz, which included  all the four countries of the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and  the Quadlings. Over this Land I ruled in peace for many years, until I  grew old and longed to see my native city once again. So when Dorothy  was first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away with  her in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me back  alone. After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to find that all my  old friends were dead or had moved away. So, having nothing else to do,  I joined a circus again, and made my balloon ascensions until the  earthquake caught me.\"    \"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little more  history about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understand--perhaps  for the reason that no one ever told it you. Many years before you came  here this Land was united under one Ruler, as it is now, and the Ruler's  name was always 'Oz', which means in our language 'Great and Good'; or,  if the Ruler happened to be a woman, her name was always 'Ozma.' But  once upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king and  rule the four parts of the kingdom themselves; so when the Ruler, my  grandfather, was hunting one day, one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole him  and carried him away, keeping him a close prisoner. Then the Witches  divided up the kingdom, and ruled the four parts of it until you came  here. That was why the people were so glad to see you, and why they  thought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler.\"    \"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two Good  Witches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in the  North and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South. But  Mombi was still my grandfather's jailor, and afterward my father's  jailor. When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that no  one would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess of  the Land of Oz. But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of my  people.\"    \"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will consider  me one of your most faithful and devoted subjects.\"    \"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,  \"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City.\"    \"Your people built it,\" he answered. \"I only bossed the job, as we say  in Omaha.\"    \"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and made  the people proud of your magical art. So, as you are now too old to  wander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long as  you live. You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be treated  with every respect and consideration.\"    \"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the little  man said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that tear-drops were  standing in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure a  home like this.    \"He's only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him.    \"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,  promptly.    \"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, who  was now feeling more at ease.    \"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess. \"I have  sent messengers to summon all of Dorothy's old friends to meet her and  give her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now.\"    Indeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,  to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see  her again. The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man,  who was an important personage in the Land of Oz.    \"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped the  soft, stuffed hands of his old friend.    \"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"I'm very certain, Oz, that  you gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them day  and night, when all other brains are fast asleep.\"    [Illustration: DOROTHY AND OZMA.]    \"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was the  next question.    \"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur. But  Ozma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and after  that I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"    Just then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threw  open the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in. Dorothy sprang  forward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the same  time a glad cry.    \"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you've grown.\"    \"Why shouldn't I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice. \"I live on  the fat of the land--don't I, Ozma?\"    \"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess.    Around Billina's neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legs  were bracelets of emeralds. She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothy's  lap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with a  sharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow. But the little girl  gave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down again  without daring to scratch.    \"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy. \"Is that the way to treat my  friends?\"    \"You have queer friends, seems to me,\" replied the kitten, in a surly  tone.    \"Seems to me the same way,\" said Billina, scornfully, \"if that beastly  cat is one of them.\"    \"Look here!\" said Dorothy, sternly. \"I won't have any quarrelling in the  Land of Oz, I can tell you! Everybody lives in peace here, and loves  everybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up and be  friends, I'll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,  _immejitly_. So, there!\"    They were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to be  good. But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends, for  all of that.    And now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifully  nickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of the  room. The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed with joy  the return of the little old Wizard.    \"Sir,\" said he to the latter, \"I never can thank you enough for the  excellent heart you once gave me. It has made me many friends, I assure  you, and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it ever did.\"    \"I'm glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard. \"I was afraid it would get  moldy in that tin body of yours.\"    \"Not at all,\" returned Nick Chopper. \"It keeps finely, being preserved  in my air-tight chest.\"    Zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; but  they were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very  much, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen. But he became  nervous again when the next visitor was announced.    \"This,\" said Princess Ozma, \"is my friend Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.,  who assisted me one time when I was in great distress, and is now the  Dean of the Royal College of Athletic Science.\"    \"Ah,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm pleased to meet so distinguished a  personage.\"    \"H. M.,\" said the Woggle-Bug, pompously, \"means Highly Magnified; and T.  E. means Thoroughly Educated. I am, in reality, a very big bug, and  doubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain.\"    \"How well you disguise it,\" said the Wizard. \"But I don't doubt your  word in the least.\"    \"Nobody doubts it, sir,\" replied the Woggle-Bug, and drawing a book from  its pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and sat  down in a corner to read.    Nobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite in  one less thoroughly educated; so they straightway forgot him and joined  in a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-time  arrived.

The bank proved vastly  advantageous. Three-fourths of every private subscription to its stock  had to be in government paper, which raised this to par, while it  naturally became the interest of all stockholders to maintain and  increase the stability and credit of the Government.        CHAPTER IV.    RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND    [1793]    In 1789 France adopted a constitution. Provoked at this, the friends of  absolute monarchy withdrew from France, and incited the other powers of  Europe to interpose in effort to restore to Louis XVI. his lost power.  The result was that Louis lost his head as well as his power, and that  France became a republic. War with all Europe followed, which elevated  that matchless military genius, Napoleon Bonaparte, first to the head of  France's armies, then to her throne, to be toppled thence in 1814,  partly by his own indiscretions, partly by the forces combined against  him.    From the beginning to the end of this revolutionary period abroad,  European politics determined American politics, home as well as foreign,  causing dangerous embarrassment and complications. War having in  February, 1793, been declared by England and France against each other,  what attitude the United States should assume toward each became a  pressing question. Washington's proclamation of neutrality, April 22,  1793, in effect, though not so meant, annulled our treaty of 1778 with  France, which bound us to certain armed services to that monarchy in  case of a rupture between her and England. Washington's paper alleged  that \"the duty and interests of the United States\" required  impartiality, and assumed \"to declare the disposition of the United  States to observe\" this.    \"The proclamation,\" wrote Jefferson, \"was in truth a most unfortunate  error. It wounds the popular feelings by a seeming indifference to the  cause of liberty. And it seems to violate the form and spirit of the  Constitution by making the executive magistrate the organ of the  'disposition' 'the duty' and 'the interest' of the nation in relation to  war and peace--subjects appropriated to other departments of  the  Government.\"    \"On one side,\" says Mr. Rives, in his \"Life of Madison,\" \"the people saw  a power which had but lately carried war and desolation, fire and sword,  through their own country, and, since the peace, had not ceased to act  toward them in the old spirit of unkindness, jealousy, arrogance, and  injustice; on the other an ally who had rendered them the most generous  assistance in war, had evinced the most cordial dispositions for a  liberal and mutually beneficial intercourse in peace, and was now set  upon by an unholy league of the monarchical powers of Europe, to  overwhelm and destroy her, for her desire to establish institutions  congenial to those of America.\"    The more sagacious opponents of the administration believed true policy  as well as true honesty to demand rigid and pronounced adherence to the  letter of the French treaty. They were convinced from the outset that  France would vanquish her enemies, and that close alliance with her was  the sure and the only sure way to coerce either Great Britain to justice  or Spain to a reasonable attitude touching the navigation of the  Mississippi; while by offending France, they argued, we should be forced  to wrestle single-handed with England first, then with victorious  France, meantime securing no concession whatever from Spain.    This was a shrewd forecast of the actual event. The Federalists,  destitute of idealism, proved to have been overawed by the prestige of  England and to have underestimated the might which freedom would impart  to the French people. After Napoleon's great campaign of 1796-97, Pitt  seeks peace, which the French Directory feels able to decline. In 1802  the Peace of Amiens is actually concluded, upon terms dictated by  France. Had we been still in France's friendship, the two republics  might have compelled England's abandonment of that course which evoked  the war of 1812. As it was, ignored by England, to whom, as detailed  below, we cringed in consenting to Jay's treaty, we were left to  encounter the French navy alone, escaping open and serious war with  France only by a readiness to negotiate which all but compromised our  dignity. The Mississippi we had at last to open with money.    The federalist leaning toward Great Britain probably did not, to so  great an extent as was then alleged and widely believed, spring from  monarchical feeling. It was due rather to old memories, as pleasant as  they were tenacious, that would not be dissociated from England; to the  individualistic tendencies of republicanism, alarming to many; and to  conservative habits of political thinking, the dread of innovation and  of theory. The returned Tories had indeed all become Federalists, which  fact, with many others, lent to this attitude the appearance of  deficient patriotism, of sycophancy toward our old foe and persecutor.    Great Britain had refused to surrender the western posts according to  the peace treaty of 1783, unjustly pleading in excuse the treatment of  loyalists by our States. Not only the presence but the active influence  of the garrisons at these posts encouraged Indian hostilities. England  had also seized French goods in American (neutral) vessels, though in  passage to the United States, and treated as belligerent all American  ships plying between France and her West Indian colonies, on the ground  that this commerce had been opened to them only by the pressure of war.  The English naval officers were instructed to regard bread-stuffs as  contraband if bound for France, even though owned by neutrals and in  neutral ships; such cargoes, however, to be paid for by England, or  released on bonds being given to land them elsewhere than in France. In  this practice England followed France's example, except that she  actually paid for the cargoes, while France only promised.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Jay.  From a painting by S. F. B. Morse in the Yale College Collection.      [1795]    Worst of all, Britain claimed and acted upon the right to press into her  naval service British-born seamen found anywhere outside the territory  of a foreign State, halting our ships on the high seas for this purpose,  often leaving them half-manned, and sometimes recklessly and cruelly  impressing native-born Americans--an outrageous policy which ended in  the war of 1812. The ignorance and injustice of the English admiralty  courts aggravated most of these abuses.    Genet's proceedings, spoken of in the next chapter, which partly public  sentiment, partly lack of army and navy, made it impossible for our  Government to prevent, enraged Great Britain to the verge of war. After  the British orders in council of November 6, 1793, intended to destroy  all neutral commerce with the French colonies, and Congress's  counter-stroke of an embargo the following March, war was positively  imminent. The President resolved to send Jay to England as envoy  extraordinary, to make one more effort for an understanding.    The treaty negotiated by this gentleman, and ratified June 24,  1795  (excepting Article XII., on the French West India trade), was doubtless  the most favorable that could have been secured under the circumstances;  yet it satisfied no one and was humiliating in the extreme. The western  posts were indeed to be vacated by June 1, 1796, though without  indemnity for the past, but a British right of search and impressment  was implicitly recognized, the French West Indian trade not rendered  secure, and arbitrary liberty accorded to Great Britain in defining  contraband. Opposition to ratification was bitter and nearly universal.  The friends of France were jubilant. Jay was burned in effigy,  Washington himself attacked. The utmost that Hamilton in his powerful  \"Letters of Camillus\" could show was that the treaty seemed preferable  to war. Plainly we had then little to hope and much to fear from war  with Great Britain, yet even vast numbers of Federalists denounced the  pact as a base surrender to the nation's ancient tyrant, and wished an  appeal to arms.    Fisher Ames's eloquence decided the House for the treaty. An invalid,  with but a span of life before him, he spoke as from the tomb. \"There  is, I believe,\" so ran his peroration, \"no member who will not think his  chance to be a witness of the consequences (should the treaty fail of  ratification) greater than mine. If, however, the vote should pass to  reject, and a spirit should rise, as it will, with the public disorders,  to make confusion worse confounded, even I, slender and almost broken as  my hold on life is, may outlive the Government and Constitution of my  country!\"    It was the most delicate crisis of  Washington's presidency, and no  other American then alive, being in his place, could have passed through  it successfully. After the fury gradually subsided, men for a long time  acquiesced rather than believed in the step which had been taken. In the  end the treaty proved solidly advantageous, rather through  circumstances, however, than by its intrinsic excellence.        CHAPTER V.    RELATIONS WITH THE FRENCH REPUBLIC    [1793]     At its beginning all Americans hailed the Revolution in France with   joy, but its terrible excesses, when they appeared, produced here the   same effect as in England, of alienating everyone conservatively   inclined. This included the mass of the Federalist party. On the   contrary, most of the Republicans, now more numerous, now less,   actuated partly by true insight into the struggle, and partly by the   magic of the words \"revolution\" and \"republic,\" favored the   revolutionists with a devotion which even the Reign of Terror in France   scarcely shook. It was in consequence of this attitude on its part that   the party came to be dubbed \"democratic-republican\" instead of   \"republican,\" the"]]]
