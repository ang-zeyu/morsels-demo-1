So it happens not infrequently that  a horse dies from ruptured stomach after vomiting. After the stomach  ruptures, however, vomiting is impossible. The death rate in this form  of colic is high.    _Treatment._--The bowels should be stimulated to contraction by the use  of clysters of large quantities of water and of glycerin. Veterinarians  use hypodermic injections of eserin or arecolin or intravenous  injections of barium chlorid, but they must be employed with great  caution. It is not profitable to give remedies by the stomach, for they  can not be absorbed. But small doses of morphin (5 grains) or of the  fluid extract of Indian hemp (2 drams) may be placed in the mouth and  are absorbed in part, at least, without passing to the stomach. These  drugs lessen pain and thus help to overcome the violent movements that  are dangerous, because they may be the means of causing rupture of the  diaphragm or stomach. If facilities are available, relief may be  afforded by passing an esophageal tube through which some of the gaseous  and liquid contents of the stomach may escape.    _Rupture of the stomach._--This mostly occurs as a result of engorged or  tympanitic stomach (engorgement colic) and from the horse violently  throwing himself when so affected. It may result from disease of the  coats of the stomach, gastritis, stones (calculi), tumors, or anything  that closes the opening of the stomach into the intestines, and very  violent pulling or jumping immediately after the animal has eaten  heartily of bulky feed. These or similar causes may lead this accident.    The symptoms of rupture of the stomach are not constant or always  reliable. Always make inquiry as to what and how much the horse has been  fed at the last meal. Vomiting may precede rupture of this organ, as  stated above. This accident appears to be most liable to occur in heavy  draft horses. A prominent symptom observed (though it may also occur in  diaphragmatic hernia) is when the horse, if possible, gets the front  feet on higher ground than the hind ones or sits on his haunches, like a  dog. This position affords relief to some extent, and it will be  maintained for several minutes; it is also quickly regained when the  horse has changed it for some other. Colicky symptoms, of course, are  present, which vary much and present no diagnostic value. As the case  progresses the horse will often stretch forward the fore legs, lean  backward and downward until the belly nearly touches the ground, and  then rise up again with a groan, after which the fluid from his nostrils  is issued in increased quantity. The pulse is fast and weak, breathing  hurried, body bathed in a clammy sweat, limbs tremble violently, the  horse reels or staggers from side to side, and death quickly ends the  scene.    In the absence of any pathognomonic symptom we must consider the history  of the case; the symptoms of colic that cease suddenly and are succeeded  by cold sweats and tremors; the pulse quick and small and thready,  growing weak and more frequent, and at length running down and becoming  altogether imperceptible; looking back at the flank and groaning;  sometimes crouching with the hind quarters; with or without eructation  and vomiting.    There is no treatment that can be of any use whatever. Could we be sure  of our diagnosis it would be better to destroy the animal at once.  Since, however, there is always the possibility of a mistake in  diagnosis, we may give powdered opium in 1-dram doses every two or three  hours, with the object of keeping the stomach as quiet as possible.    OBSTRUCTION COLIC.--The stomach or bowels may be obstructed by  accumulations of partly digested feed (fecal matter), by foreign bodies,  by displacements, by paralysis, or by abnormal growths.    _Impaction of the large intestines._--This is a very common bowel  trouble and one which, if not promptly recognized and properly treated,  results in death. It is caused by overfeeding, especially of bulky feed  containing an excess of indigestible residue; old, dry, hard hay, or  stalks when largely fed; deficiency of secretions of the intestinal  tracts; lack of water; want of exercise, medicines, etc.    Impaction of the large bowels is to be diagnosed by a slight abdominal  pain, which may disappear for a day or two to reappear with more  violence. The feces are passed somewhat more frequently, but in smaller  quantities and drier; the abdomen is full, but not distended with gas;  the horse at first is noticed to paw and soon begins to look back at his  sides. Probably one of the most characteristic symptoms is the position  assumed when down. He lies flat on his side, head and legs extended,  occasionally raising his head to look toward his flank; he remains on  his side for from five to fifteen minutes at a time. Evidently this  position is the one giving the most freedom from pain. He rises at  times, walks about the stall, paws, looks at his sides, backs up against  the stall, which he presses with his tail, and soon lies down again,  assuming his favored position. The intestinal sounds, as heard by  applying the ear to the flank, are diminished, or there is no sound,  indicating absence of motion of the bowels. The bowels may cease  entirely to move. The pressure of the distended intestine upon the  bladder may cause the horse to make frequent attempts to urinate. The  pulse is but little changed at first, being full and sluggish; later, if  this condition is not overcome, it becomes rapid and feeble. Horses may  suffer from impaction of the bowels for a week, yet eventually recover,  and cases extending two or even three weeks have ended favorably. As a  rule, however, they seldom last more than four or five days, many, in  fact, dying sooner than this.    The treatment consists of efforts to produce movement of the bowels and  to prevent inflammation of the same from arising. A large cathartic is  to be given as early as possible. Either of the following is  recommended: Powdered Barbados aloes 1 ounce, calomel 2 drams, and  powdered nux vomica 1 dram; or linseed oil 1 pint and croton oil 15  drops; or from 1 pint to 1 quart of castor oil may be given. Some favor  the administration of Epsom or Glauber's salt, 1 pound, with one-quarter  pound of common salt, claiming that this causes the horse to drink  largely of water, thus mechanically softening the impacted mass and  favoring its expulsion. Whichever physic is selected, it is essential  that a full dose be given. This is much better than small and repeated  doses. It must be borne in mind that horses require about twenty-four  hours in which to respond to a physic, and under no circumstances is it  to be repeated sooner. If aloes has been given and has failed to operate  at the proper time, oil or some different cathartic should then be  administered. Allow the horse all the water he will drink. Calomel may  be administered in half-dram doses, the powder being placed on the  tongue, one dose every two hours until four doses are given.    Enemas of glycerin, 2 to 4 ounces, are often beneficial. Rubbing or  kneading of the abdominal walls and the application of stimulating  liniments or strong mustard water also, at times, favor the expulsion of  this mass. Walking exercise must occasionally be given. If this  treatment is faithfully carried out from the start the majority of cases  will terminate favorably. When relief is not obtained inflammation of  the bowels may ensue and cause death.    _Constipation, or costiveness._--This is often witnessed in the horse,  and particularly in the foal. Many colts die every year from failure on  the part of the attendant to note the condition of the bowels soon after  birth. Whenever the foal fails to pass any feces, and in particular if  it presents any signs of colicky pains--straining, etc.--immediate  attention must be given it. As a rule, it will be necessary only to give  a few injections of soapy water in the rectum and to introduce the  finger through the anus to break down any hardened mass of dung found  there. If this is not effective a purgative must be given. Oils are the  best for these young animals, and preferably castor oil, giving from 2  to 4 ounces. The foal should always get the first of the mother's milk,  which, for a few days, possesses decidedly laxative properties. If a  mare, while suckling, is taking laudanum, morphin, atropia, or similar  medicines, the foal during this time should be fed by hand and the mare  milked upon the ground. Constipation in adult horses is often the result  of long feeding on dry, innutritious feed, deficiency of intestinal  secretions, scanty water supply, or lack of exercise. If the case is not  complicated with colicky symptoms a change to light, sloppy diet,  linseed gruel or tea, with plenty of exercise, is all that is required.  If colic exists a cathartic is needed. In very many instances the  constipated condition of the bowels is due to lack of intestinal  secretions, and when so caused may be treated by giving fluid extract of  belladonna in 2-dram doses three times a day and handful doses of Epsom  salt daily in the feed. It is always best, when possible, to overcome  this trouble by a change of diet rather than by the use of medicines.  For the relief of constipation such succulent feeds as roots, grass, or  green forage are recommended. Silage, however, should be fed sparingly,  and not at all unless it is in the very best condition. Moldy silage may  cause fatal disease.    _Foreign bodies (calculi, stones) in the stomach._--There are probably  but few symptoms exhibited by the horse that will lead one to suspect  the presence of gastric calculi, and possibly none by which we can  unmistakably assert their presence. They have been found most frequently  in millers' horses fed sweepings from the mills. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.
