The more he tried to convince  himself he was doing only a slight wrong, the more his conscience cried  out he was running to his ruin.  But he stopped his ears and shut his  eyes, and blindly dared his fate.  He went that evening to the music-  hall.  He met Gus and Mortimer, and two other friends.  He had taken  care to get himself up in a nearer approach to his companions' style.  He bought some cigars of his own on the way, and offered them with a  less awkward swagger than he had been able to assume the night before.  He found himself able to nod familiarly to the barmaid, and fancied that  even Mortimer must have approved of the way in which he ordered about  the billiard-marker.    In the match with Gus for half-crowns he lost, though only narrowly--so  narrowly that he was not content, without a further trial of skill, to  own himself beaten, and therefore challenged his adversary to a second  meeting the next evening.  Then he watched the others play, and betted  with Mortimer on the result--and alas! for him, he won.    It was Tom himself who said, at nine o'clock,--    \"And now, suppose we see what's going on below.\"    It was the same stupid, disgusting spectacle, but to Tom it seemed less  repulsive than he had found it the night before.  True, he at times felt  a return of the old feeling of shame; the blush would occasionally  suffuse his face; but such fits were rare, and he was able to carry them  off more easily with joke and laughter.    \"Jack,\" said Gus in a whisper to Mortimer, as Tom, after accepting a  very broad hint to treat the party to spirits, was turning to go, \"that  fellow will be a credit to you and me.  Did you see how he smacked his  lips over the play, and yet all the while wanted to make us think he saw  that sort of thing every day of his life, eh?  He's a promising chap,  eh, Jack?\"    \"Wathah,\" replied Jack, laughing.    Meanwhile Tom, glad enough to get out into the pure air, though in not  so desperate a case as the night before, shouldered his way among the  loitering company towards the door.  He was just emerging into the  street, when the sound of voices arrested him.    \"That's one of our men, isn't it?\" said one.    \"Why, so it is; I fancied he was anything but a festive blade.  Yes; and  upon my word he's half seas over!\"    Tom had no difficulty in discovering that these hurried words had  reference to him, and turning instinctively towards the voices, he found  himself face to face with two, reputedly, of the wildest of his fellow-  students.    Gladly would he have avoided them; gladly would he have shrunk back and  lost himself in the crowd, but it was too late now; he stood discovered.    \"How are you?\" cried one of the two, as he passed; \"isn't your name  Drift?\"    Tom stared as if he would have denied his name; but the next moment he  put on his lately acquired swagger, and said, \"Yes.\"    \"Ah!  I thought so; one of the Saint Elizabeth men.  Hullo! he's in a  hurry, though,\" added he, as Tom made a dive forward and strode rapidly  down the street.    It was but a step deeper.  Well he knew that by to-morrow every one of  his fellow-students would know of him as a frequenter of that wretched  place.  Well he knew that, as far as they were concerned, the mask of  shyness and reticence under which he had sheltered in their midst was  for ever pulled away.  \"One of us,\" indeed!  So truly the very worst of  them might now speak and think of him.  Oh, if he had but considered in  time; if he had but stemmed this flood at its source!  But it was too  late now.    And he strode home reckless and hardened.    The next day, as he expected, every one seemed to know of his visits to  the music-hall.  The two who had seen him accosted him with every show  of friendship and intelligence.  He was appealed to in the presence of  nearly a dozen of his fellow-students as to the name of one of the low  songs there given; he was asked if he was going to be there to-night,  and he was invited to join this party and that in similar expeditions to  similar places.  And to all these questions and greetings he was  constrained to reply in keeping with his assumed character of a gay  spark.  How sick, how vile he felt; yet in that one day how hardened and  desperate he became!    It was not in Tom Drift to cry \"I have sinned!  I will return!\"  No,  once loose from his moorings, he let himself float down the stream,  watching the receding banks in mute despair, raising no shout for  succour, venturing no plunge for safety.    You, who by this time have given him up, disgusted at his weakness, his  vanity, his low instincts, his cowardliness--who say let him wallow in  the mire he has prepared for himself, who know so glibly what you would  have done, what you would have said, what you would have felt, remember  once more that Tom Drift was not such as you; and unfortunately did not  know you.  He was not gifted with your heroic resolution or your all-  penetrating wisdom.  He was an ordinary sinful being of flesh and blood,  relying only on his own poor strength; and therefore, reader, try to  realise all he went through before you fling your stone.    The toils were closing round him fast.  His will had been the first to  suffer, his conscience next.  Then with a rush had gone honour,  temperance, and purity; and now finally the flimsy rag, his good name,  had been torn from him, and he stood revealed a prodigal--and a  hypocrite.    Even yet, however, help might have been forthcoming.    \"I say, you fellow,\" said one of his fellow-students this same day,  \"I've never spoken to you before, and perhaps shall never do so again;  but _don't be a fool_!\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Tom sharply.    \"Only this, and I can't help it if you are angry, keep clear of these  new friends of yours, and still more, keep clear of the places they  visit.  If you've been led in once, rather cut off your right hand than  be led in again, that's all!\"    What spirit of infatuation possessed Tom Drift, that he did not spring  for very life at the proffered help, that he did not besiege this  friend, however blunt and outspoken, and compel his timely aid?  Alas,  for his blindness and folly!    Scowling round at the speaker, he muttered an oath, and said, \"What on  earth concern is it of yours who my friends are and where I go?  Mind  your own business.\"    And so, thrusting rudely away the hand that might, by God's grace, have  saved him, he swept farther and farther out towards the dark waters.    One final and great hope was still reserved for him, and that was  Charlie's visit.  But to Tom that prospect was becoming day by day mere  distasteful.  As the days wore on, and Tom sunk deeper and deeper into  the snare prepared for him, the thought of a week in the society of one  so upright and pure as Charlie became positively odious.  The effort to  conceal his new condition would be almost impossible, and yet to admit  it to him would be, he felt, to shatter for ever the only friendship he  really prized.  He racked his brain for expedients and excuses to avert  the visit, but without avail.  If he pleaded illness Charlie would be  the first to rush to his bedside; if he pleaded hard work Charlie would  insist on sharing it, or improving its few intervals of rest; if he  pleaded disinclination Charlie would devise a hundred other plans to  please him.  In short, Charlie's visit was inevitable, and as he looked  forward to it he writhed in misgiving and anxiety.    His visits to the music-hall were meanwhile continuing, and his circle  of acquaintance at that evil haunt enlarging.  He was duly installed as  one of the \"fast set\" at Saint Elizabeth's, and under its auspices had  already made his _debut_ at other scenes and places than that of his  first transgression.  He was known by sight to a score of billiard-  markers, potmen, blacklegs, and lower characters still, and was on  nodding terms with fully half of them.  He had lost considerably more  than he had gained at billiards, and was still further emptying his  purse at cards.  Quick work for a few weeks!  So quickly and fatally,  alas!  Will the infection, once admitted, spread, especially in a  patient whose moral constitution has undergone so long a course of slow  preparation as Tom's had.    The day came at last.  Tom had carefully hidden away his worst books and  his spirits; he had bathed his face half a dozen times, to remove the  traces of last night's intemperance he had gathered together from the  corners where they had for so long lain neglected the books and relics  of his Randlebury days, and restored them to their old places; he had  brightened me up, and he had taken pains to purify his room from the  smell of rank tobacco; and then he sauntered down to the station.    How my heart beat as the train came into the platform!  _His_ head was  out of the window, and _his_ hand was waving to us a hundred yards off;  and the next minute he had burst from the carriage, and seized Tom by  the hands.    \"How are you, old Tom?  I thought we'd never get here; how glad I am to  set eyes on you!  Isn't this a spree?\"  And not waiting for Tom's answer  he hauled his traps out of the carriage in a transport of delight.    Still the same jovial, honest, fine-hearted boy.    \"Hi! here! some of you,\" he shouted to a porter, \"look after these  things, will you, and get us a cab.  I tell you what, Tom, you've got to  come up home with me first, and we can have dinner there; then I'll come  on to your den, and we can pack our knapsacks and sleep, and then start  by the five train to-morrow morning.\"    Thus he bustled, and thus he brought back the old times on poor Tom  Drift.  Without the heart to speak, he helped his friend to collect his  luggage, and when they were fairly started in the cab he even smiled  feebly in reply to the boy's sallies.    \"Tom, you rascal, didn't I tell you you weren't to knock yourself up,  eh?  Why can't you do "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#19)"],[1,"had suggested), for  this place, they would have found themselves rather cramped for room by  the time they were all assembled; for the first-floor offices which I  entered were decidedly limited in their capacity.  I, who had been  expecting at least a place capable of holding several scores of clerks,  was somewhat taken aback to find myself in a counting-house which  accommodated only half a score, and even that at rather close quarters.  In fact, I was so much taken aback that, although I had seen the name  plainly inscribed on the door, I was constrained to inquire on entering,  \"Is this Messrs. Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's office, please?\"    \"Yes,\" said one of the clerks, shortly, \"what about it?\"    \"Oh, if you please,\" I began, \"I've come to--that is I've--\"    \"Come, out with it, can't you?\" said the clerk.    \"It's the situation,\" said I, feeling very uncomfortable.    \"Well, what about it?\" said the clerk, who, evidently cheered by the  smiles of his fellow-clerks, thought it a good joke to browbeat a poor  green country boy.    \"Only I've come after it,\" faltered I.    \"Have you, though?  And who told you to do that, I'd like to know?\"    \"My uncle--that is I had a letter--\" but here a general laugh  interrupted my confession, and I felt very foolish indeed.    \"So you've got an uncle, have you?  Do you ever lend him your gold  watch?\"    This witticism was lost on me.  I didn't see the connection between my  uncle borrowing my gold watch (if I had had one), and the situation at  Messrs. Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's.  But it would never do to make  myself disagreeable.    \"I've not got a gold watch, or a silver one either,\" I said.    This seemed to occasion fresh merriment among my catechist and his  fellows.    \"Why don't you say who told you to come?\" demanded the clerk.    \"I did say,\" mildly replied I.  \"I got a letter.\"    \"What's that to do with it?  I got a letter to-day, didn't I, Wallop, to  tell me my washerwoman had changed her address.  But that's no reason  for my coming here.\"    This was perfectly sound reasoning.  So I amended my explanation.    \"I got a letter from Merrett, Barnacle, and Company.--\"    \"_Messrs_.  Merrett, Barnacle, and Company, if you please,\" put in the  clerk.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said I, \"from Messrs. Merrett, Barnacle, and  Company, telling me to be here at 10:15.\"    \"Oh.  Why didn't you say that before?  What's the use of prevaricating  when it's just as easy to tell the truth straight out, eh?  What's the  time now?\"    \"Twenty past,\" said I, looking at the clock.    \"And you call that punctual?  That's a nice beginning, anyhow.  What's  your name?\"    \"Batchelor,\" said I.    This again appeared to afford amusement to the company in general; and  one or two jokes at the expense of my name were forthcoming, which I  bore with as good a grace as I could.    At length it pleased the clerk who had cross-examined me to get off his  stool, and after poking the fire and consulting the directory, and  skirmishing pleasantly with a fellow-clerk for a minute or two, to go to  the door of the inner-room and knock there.    \"Come in,\" I heard a voice answer, and the clerk entered.    He emerged again in a moment and beckoned to me.  Now was the time!  I  braced myself up to the ordeal, and not heeding the facetious dig in the  ribs which the clerk gave me in passing, I put on my best face, and  entered the awful presence.    Two gentlemen sat facing one another at the table, one of them old, the  other middle-aged.  These I instantly guessed to be Messrs. Merrett and  Barnacle.  Mr Barnacle, the junior partner, who had a sharp voice and a  stern face, undertook my examination, Mr Merrett only coming in  occasionally with some mild observation.    \"You are Batchelor,\" said Mr Barnacle, when I had entered and carefully  closed the door behind me.  I noticed he held in his hand my original  letter of application.  \"You are Frederick Batchelor.  How is it you are  late?\"    \"I'm sorry, sir,\" faltered I, at this rather discouraging beginning,  \"but--\"    And here I stuck.  What was the use of trying to explain what still  remained the fact?    Mr Barnacle eyed me keenly, and continued, \"You are fourteen, you say,  have just left school, and are good at arithmetic.  What school were you  at?\"    \"Stonebridge House, sir.\"    \"Where is that?\"    \"In Cliffshire.\"    \"And you think you would suit us?\"    \"I'd try, sir,\" said I.    \"Do you know what our work is?\" said Mr Barnacle.    \"No, sir, not exactly,\" I replied.    \"Generally speaking,\" mildly put in Mr Merrett, \"you've a sort of  idea.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, not quite sure whether I was telling the truth or not.    Mr Barnacle touched his bell, and the clerk appeared.    \"Bring me the invoice-book, Doubleday.\"    Mr Doubleday returned directly with a large account-book, which he  deposited on the table before the junior partner.    Mr Barnacle pushed it towards me.    \"I want a list made out of all the goods sent to Mr Walker, of Bombay,  since the beginning of the year.  Let me see you make it out.\"  Then  touching his bell again, he said to Mr Doubleday, the clerk, \"Here,  Doubleday, give this boy some invoice paper and a pen, and let him write  at your desk.  He is to make a copy of all Walker's invoices since the  beginning of this year.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Doubleday.    \"Be particular that he receives no assistance, and bring me the sheets  when completed.  Batchelor, take this book and follow Mr Doubleday to  the counting-house.\"    \"Do it as well as you can, without any help,\" mildly put in Mr Merrett,  by way of encouragement.    I followed my conductor in a state of terrible trepidation, feeling that  all this wasn't a bit like what I had expected my interview with Messrs.  Merrett, Barnacle, and Company to be.    \"Here, hop up, young fellow,\" said Mr Doubleday, pointing to a high  stool at one of the desks, \"and pull up your boot.\"    I concluded this last expression meant make haste, and I accordingly  pulled up my boot, and lost no time in setting myself to my task.    I was to make out a list of all that Walker of Bombay had had since the  beginning of the year.  I opened the big account-book; it contained a  great many accounts, some long, some short.  I began at the beginning,  and searched through for any belonging to Walker of Bombay.    At length, after about twenty pages, I found an entry dated December  30th last year.  That would not do; I was only to make a list of what  had been sent this year; and yet, on looking again, I saw it noted that  these goods, though entered on the 30th of December, had not been  shipped till the 2nd of January.  Here was a poser to begin with.  I  looked up and caught the eye of Doubleday, who, evidently enjoying my  perplexity, was watching me.    \"I say,\" I ventured to say, \"does he mean--\"    \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" broke out the virtuous Doubleday.  \"Didn't you  hear Mr Barnacle say you were to get no assistance?  What do you mean  by it?  I'm ashamed of you; so's Wallop.\"    \"I shall mention the matter to the governor,\" observed Wallop, with a  grin at his ally.    \"Oh, don't,\" I said.  \"I beg your pardon!\"  It was evidently hopeless to  expect any light from without on the problem, so I decided for myself I  would include the account in question.  I was just beginning to copy it  out, and to shut my ears to the chaff that was going on around me, when  the counting-house door opened, and the solemn face of my friend Smith  appeared, asking if Messrs. Merrett, Barnacle, and Company were at home.    His quick eye detected me at once, and I felt very uncomfortable, lest  he should misunderstand the state of affairs and jump to the conclusion  that I had been already engaged by the firm.  At all risks I determined  to put him right on this point.    \"I'm not taken on, Jack,\" I said, before his question had been answered.  \"They've given me--\"    \"I'll give you a box on the ears, young gentleman,\" broke out the amazed  Doubleday.  \"You're forgetting yourself.  Go on with your work.  Now  then, young hop-o'-my-thumb,\" said he, addressing himself to Smith,  \"what do you want?\"    Smith solemnly produced a letter, which he exhibited to the senior  clerk.    \"Oh, you're after the place too, are you, young bull's-eye?\"    \"Yes,\" said Smith, solemnly, and apparently not aware that the last  expression had been intended as a joke.    \"Why don't you laugh, eh?\" cried Wallop; \"we all laugh here when Doubles  makes a joke; don't we, Crow?\"    Mr Crow, thus appealed to, replied, \"Oh, of course.  We don't get much  laughing, though.\"    Mr Doubleday waxed red in the face at this, and rounded on Smith.    \"Don't go staring at me, do you hear?  Look in the fireplace, can't you?  and then you won't set alight to anything.  Do you know this kid here?\"  added he, pointing at me over his shoulder.    \"Yes,\" replied Smith.    \"Do you know he's after the place?\"    \"Yes,\" said Smith.    \"Then what do you want to come after it for?  One of you's enough, ain't  it?\"    Smith stared solemnly at the speaker, whereat that virtuous individual  waxed once more very wroth.    \"Look here, if you can't cast your eyes somewhere else, young fellow,  I'll cast them for you, so now.  Why don't you answer my question?\"    \"I was told to be here at half-past ten,\" replied Jack.    \"Then what do you mean by coming at twenty-eight past, eh, you young  ruffian?  Stay outside the door till the right time.\"    Smith obeyed solemnly, and for exactly two minutes remained outside.  At  the end of that period he returned.    Mr Doubleday, evidently perplexed for the moment how to get a rise out  of him, announced him to the partners, and I saw him vanish into the  inner-room.    \"I say, Wallop,\" said Doubleday, when he had disappeared, \"I hope  they're not going to take on a couple of them.\"    My heart bounded as I listened.  The bare suggestion was delightful.    \"I hope not,\" said Wallop.  \"I"]]]
