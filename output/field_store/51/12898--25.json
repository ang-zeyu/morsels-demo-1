It was a good old plan--one that doubtless came from the days when  Buffalo and Coyote played the parts of Cow and Dog. Jack never forgot  it, and more than once it saved his life.    In color as well as in power he was a rarity.    Animals are colored in one or other of two general plans: one that  matches them with their surroundings and helps them to hide--this is  called \"protective\"; the other that makes them very visible for several  purposes--this is called \"directive.\" Jack-rabbits are peculiar in  being painted both ways. As they squat in their form in the gray brush  or clods, they are soft gray on their ears, head, back, and sides; they  match the ground and cannot be seen until close at hand--they are  protectively colored. But the moment it is clear to the Jack that the  approaching foe will find him, he jumps up and dashes away. He throws  off all disguise now, the gray seems to disappear; he makes a lightning  change, and his ears show snowy white with black tips, the legs are  white, his tail is a black spot in a blaze of white. He is a  black-and-white Rabbit now. His coloring is all directive. How is it  done? Very simply. The front side of the ear is gray, the back, black  and white. The black tail with its white halo, and the legs, are tucked  below. He is sitting on them. The gray mantle is pulled down and  enlarged as he sits, but when he jumps up it shrinks somewhat, all his  black-and-white marks are now shown, and just as his colors formerly  whispered, \"I am a clod,\" they now shout aloud, \"I am a Jack-rabbit.\"    Why should he do this? Why should a timid creature running for his life  thus proclaim to all the world his name instead of trying to hide?  There must be some good reason. It must pay, or the Rabbit would never  have done it.    The answer is, if the creature that scared him up was one of his own  kind--i.e., this was a false alarm--then at once, by showing his  national colors, the mistake is made right. On the other hand, if it be  a Coyote, Fox, or Dog, they see at once, this is a Jack-rabbit, and  know that it would be waste of time for them to pursue him. They say in  effect, \"This is a Jack-rabbit, and I cannot catch a Jack in open  race.\" They give it up, and that, of course, saves the Jack a great  deal of unnecessary running and worry. The black-and-white spots are  the national uniform and flag of the Jacks. In poor specimens they are  apt to be dull, but in the finest specimens they are not only larger,  but brighter than usual, and the Little Warhorse, gray when he sat in  his form, blazed like charcoal and snow, when he flung his defiance to  the Fox and buff Coyote, and danced with little effort before them,  first a black-and-white Jack, then a little white spot, and last a  speck of thistledown, before the distance swallowed him.    Many of the farmers' Dogs had learned the lesson: \"A grayish Rabbit you  may catch, but a very black-and-white one is hopeless.\" They might,  indeed, follow for a time, but that was merely for the fun of a chivvy,  and his growing power often led Warhorse to seek the chase for the sake  of a little excitement, and to take hazards that others less gifted  were most careful to avoid.    Jack, like all other wild animals, had a certain range or country which  was home to him, and outside of this he rarely strayed. It was about  three miles across, extending easterly from the centre of the village.  Scattered through this he had a number of \"forms,\" or \"beds\" as they  are locally called. These were mere hollows situated under a sheltering  bush or bunch of grass, without lining excepting the accidental grass  and in-blown leaves. But comfort was not forgotten. Some of them were  for hot weather; they faced the north, were scarcely sunk, were little  more than shady places. Some for the cold weather were deep hollows  with southern exposure, and others for the wet were well roofed with  herbage and faced the west. In one or other of these he spent the day,  and at night he went forth to feed with his kind, sporting and romping  on the moonlight nights like a lot of puppy Dogs, but careful to be  gone by sunrise, and safely tucked in a bed that was suited to the  weather.    The safest ground for the Jacks was among the farms, where not only  Osage hedges, but also the newly arrived barb-wire, made hurdles and  hazards in the path of possible enemies. But the finest of the forage  is nearer to the village among the truck-farms--the finest of forage  and the fiercest of dangers. Some of the dangers of the plains were  lacking, but the greater perils of men, guns, Dogs, and impassable  fences are much increased. Yet those who knew Warhorse best were not at  all surprised to find that he had made a form in the middle of a  market-gardener's melon-patch. A score of dangers beset him here, but  there was also a score of unusual delights and a score of holes in the  fence for times when he had to fly, with at least twoscore of  expedients to help him afterward.      III    Newchusen was a typical Western town. Everywhere in it, were to be seen  strenuous efforts at uglification, crowned with unmeasured success. The  streets were straight level lanes without curves or beauty-spots. The  houses were cheap and mean structures of flimsy boards and tar paper,  and not even honest in their ugliness, for each of them was pretending  to be something better than itself. One had a false front to make it  look like two stories, another was of imitation brick, a third  pretended to be a marble temple.    But all agreed in being the ugliest things ever used as human  dwellings, and in each could be read the owner's secret thought--to  stand it for a year or so, then move out somewhere else. The only  beauties of the place, and those unintentional, were the long lines of  hand-planted shade-trees, uglified as far as possible with whitewashed  trunks and croppy heads, but still lovable, growing, living things.    The only building in town with a touch of picturesqueness was the grain  elevator. It was not posing as a Greek temple or a Swiss chalet, but  simply a strong, rough, honest, grain elevator. At the end of each  street was a vista of the prairie, with its farm-houses, windmill  pumps, and long lines of Osage-orange hedges. Here at least was  something of interest--the gray-green hedges, thick, sturdy, and high,  were dotted with their golden mock-oranges, useless fruit, but more  welcome here than rain in a desert; for these balls were things of  beauty, and swung on their long tough boughs they formed with the soft  green leaves a color-chord that pleased the weary eye.    Such a town is a place to get out of, as soon as possible, so thought  the traveller who found himself laid over here for two days in late  winter. He asked after the sights of the place. A white Muskrat stuffed  in a case \"down to the saloon\"; old Baccy Bullin, who had been scalped  by the Indians forty years ago; and a pipe once smoked by Kit Carson,  proved unattractive, so he turned toward the prairie, still white with  snow.    A mark among the numerous Dog tracks caught his eye: it was the track  of a large Jack-rabbit. He asked a passer-by if there were any Rabbits  in town.    \"No, I reckon not. I never seen none,\" was the answer. A mill-hand gave  the same reply, but a small boy with a bundle of newspapers said: \"You  bet there is; there's lots of them out there on the prairie, and they  come in town a-plenty. Why, there's a big, big feller lives right round  Si Kalb's melon-patch--oh, an awful big feller, and just as black and  as white as checkers!\" and thus he sent the stranger eastward on his  walk.    The \"big, big, awful big one\" was the Little Warhorse himself. He  didn't live in Kalb's melon-patch; he was there only at odd times. He  was not there now; he was in his west-fronting form or bed, because a  raw east wind was setting in. It was due east of Madison Avenue, and as  the stranger plodded that way the Rabbit watched him. As long as the  man kept the road the Jack was quiet, but the road turned shortly to  the north, and the man by chance left it and came straight on. Then the  Jack saw trouble ahead. The moment the man left the beaten track, he  bounded from his form, and wheeling, he sailed across the prairie due  east.    A Jack-rabbit running from its enemy ordinarily covers eight or nine  feet at a bound, and once in five or six bounds, it makes an  observation hop, leaping not along, but high in the air, so as to get  above all herbage and bushes and take in the situation. A silly young  Jack will make an observation hop as often as one in four, and so waste  a great deal of time. A clever Jack will make one hop in eight or nine,  do for observation. But Jack Warhorse as he sped, got all the  information he needed, in one hop out of a dozen, while ten to fourteen  feet were covered by each of his flying bounds. Yet another personal  peculiarity showed in the trail he left. When a Cottontail or a  Wood-hare runs, his tail is curled up tight on his back, and does not  touch the snow. When a Jack runs, his tail hangs downward or backward,  with the tip curved or straight, according to the individual; in some,  it points straight down, and so, often leaves a little stroke behind  the foot-marks. The Warhorse's tail of shining black, was of unusual  length, and at every bound, it left in the snow, a long stroke, so long  that that alone was almost enough to tell which Rabbit had made the  track.    Now some Rabbits seeing only a man without any Dog would have felt  little fear, but Warhorse, remembering some former stinging experiences  with a far-killer, fled when the foe was seventy-five yards away, and  skimming low, he ran southeast to a fence that ran easterly. Behind  this he went like a low-flying Hawk, till a mile away he reached  another of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#19)"],[1,"ent, but the affection of the natives--and the applause of all  good men. His name will be had in everlasting remembrance: happier  still, if numbered by the judge of all among his followers, who came  \"not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\"[21]    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 18: \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Kemp, of Mount Vernon at the mess at  the Macquarie Hotel, \"you see a sample before you, of what this colony  can produce, which we are now, one and all, making an unanimous effort  to insure the enjoyment of in peace and comfort: if, when not only the  necessaries, but many of the luxuries of life are thus bountifully  supplied us, we are not loyal, we shall never be loyal.

History does not furnish an instance, where _a whole nation  has been removed by so _MILD AND HUMANE A POLICY!\"_--Report H.  Commons_--_Aborigines_, 1835.]        SECTION VIII.    During the progress of these captures, the question of future disposal  was slowly determined. Those lodged on Gun Carriage Island, through  injudicious restraint or want of pure water, or melancholy, rapidly  decreased. The government was bound to seek for them a more salubrious  prison, or to restore them to the main land: an event, which would have  ensured their immediate destruction. Maria Island, recommended both by  Mr. Robinson and Mr. Bedford, was desirable, as contiguous; but nothing  could prevent an escape to the colony. Kent's Group, on the coast of New  Holland, was next proposed; but the passage is difficult, and between  the islands, said the sailor witness, \"the sea pours like a sluice, and  the winds drive through like a funnel.\" Then came King's Island,  situated 140 miles north of Van Diemen's Land; but it was said to be  infested with badgers and bandicoots, and that the natives would retire  into the woods, and be no more found. Such was the extent of official  knowledge, in reference to these dependencies, that to select a spot it  was necessary to appoint a special survey; but although the natives were  fast dying, the vessel destined to this service was first sent for a  cargo of timber!    Captain Jackson having visited the Straits, recommended Flinders',  sometimes called Great Island. The aborigines who joined in this visit,  were delighted with the country: they returned to their companions with  the spoils of hunting, and celebrated their good fortune in songs. A  soldier, who accompanied the party, wholly differed from this report: he  said the climate was bleak, the soil sterile, and destitute of springs;  and his objections, though attributed to malice, have been confirmed by  experience. After much deliberation, Flinders' Island was preferred.    The Chief Justice, Sir John Pedder, opposed the removal altogether: too  truly he judged, it would be followed by rapid extinction. In denying to  the aboriginal remnant an asylum within the country of their  forefathers, we inflicted the last penalty which can fall on a race,  whose lives the victors condescend to spare. It was too late, however,  to repent; and pioneers were forwarded to the place of exile. The usual  fatality attended the first choice of a township, but in 1832 Mr.  Backhouse, at Colonel Arthur's request, proceeded to Flinders', where  the station was finally chosen; it was called, _Wybalenna_,--the \"Black  Man's Village.\" The natives were under disguised military control, but  were exceedingly docile and submissive. Cottages were erected for their  use. The women found some amusement in sweeping their houses, and  depositing or replacing the articles of their furniture--their beds,  bedsteads, tables, and stools: they washed the garments of their  husbands; who, when they had occasion to complain, threatened to work  for themselves. They had seen the wives of the soldiers washing, and  inferred that this exercise was the special privilege of women.    The acting commandant, in 1832, reported them as in the highest health  and spirits, full of intelligence, advancing step by step towards  civilisation: so they were described, and such was their aspect. They  were furnished with every article of domestic use, far more numerous  than usually fall to the lot of the English cottager, and which, to an  Irish peasant, would suggest the idea of shopkeeping: the men, dressed  in duck clothing and Scotch caps, voluntarily appeared with the  soldiers, and presented their necessaries for inspection.    A large group watched the landing of Mr. Backhouse in silence; but when  invited, they rose up and shook hands; and when told that provisions had  arrived, they set up shouts of joy: they wore clothing, except in their  dances, which they held thrice a-week, after sun set; they exhibited  much cheerfulness, affability, and mutual kindness, and no great  deficiency of either physical or intellectual power.    The system pursued by Mr. Robinson at Flinders', is minutely described  in papers published by the House of Commons. The establishment of--    1. An aboriginal fund. 2. A circulating medium. 3. An aboriginal police.  4. A weekly market: and 5. A weekly periodical.    The first four of these measures succeeded: the periodical _was not_  successful! but Mr. Robinson established a respectable currency: he made  the natives purchase all articles except food; and once, when the supply  of tobacco was scanty, it rose to the price of 32s. per lb.! They were  too prone to dilapidate and destroy their dwellings; they were therefore  required to pay for the locks, cupboards, and doors. They were  instructed in the Christian religion, and displayed considerable  aptitude; but of some, it is remarked, that they were inattentive to  learning, and fond of the chase!    The civil and religious administration of Flinders' Island has been  often changed, and subject to factions and disputes. The stories which  float in the colony, respecting the little empire of _Wybalenna_, are  grotesque and humorous. No modern author will venture to look into the  abyss of despatches, which develop its policy. To arrive at the truth  would require an amount of labour, perhaps not beyond its intrinsic  worth, but involving large discussions and questions not without peril.  Mr. Backhouse, before leaving the colony, renewed his visit as the envoy  of the government, to heal divisions which had broken out with virulence  between the ecclesiastical and civil powers. He observes, that they  principally resulted from misunderstandings, and with this caution we  resign them to the curious of some other age. It may, however, be  satisfactory to know, that in the order of succession, Messrs. Darling,  Robinson, Drs. Jeannerett and Milligan, have been commandants, and that  Mr. Wilkinson, Rev. Mr. Dove, and Mr. Clark, have filled the office of  chaplain.    The religious manifestations of the aborigines are differently estimated  by different minds: by some, considered purely mechanical and imitative;  by others, as the simple expressions of a genuine piety. The evidence of  their worth, would depend greatly on accompanying moral developments.  The piety of a proselyted heathen is like that of a child, more in  sensibility than concatenated dogmata: they repeated a creed, only  partially understood; but they also became conscious of a Superior  Power, and a nobler destiny. The highly intelligent appreciation of  religious knowledge, attributed by their guardians, did not appear to  the casual visitor; and was probably, unconsciously, coloured. It does  not pertain to this work to examine the evidence of their personal  religion, which, however, sometimes had a conservative influence in  life, and to several yielded consolation in their last hours.    In 1835, Mr. Robinson entered on his office as commandant: believing  that his mission was accomplished, he gathered the people together, and  made a feast, in which they were to forget the animosities of their  tribes, and join as one family. Scarcely was this union effected, when  the occupation of Port Phillip drew attention to the aborigines of New  Holland. Mr. Wedge, who visited that country, made known to the  government the barbarity of the monstrous whites; who, so soon as they  touched those shores, wantonly stained their hands with native blood. To  that gentleman we owe our ability to trace to its origin, an  extermination which has kept pace with the colonisation of that region.    Mr. Robinson proposed to remove the natives of Tasmania, then eighty-two  persons, to Port Phillip. It was expected that their presence would  excite the curiosity, and stimulate the civilisation of the New  Hollanders; that possession of a flock, then 1,300 in number, would give  useful ideas of the bounty of their benefactors. It had been thought  desirable to reward the aboriginal guides, and one hundred ewes and  three rams were forwarded to the establishment, to be distributed among  them: a large addition was made by private benevolence. The increase of  their flock, became a source of temporary profit to the natives: the  wool was brought to Launceston, and exchanged for haberdashery, and  other articles of domestic use.    The British government, after much hesitation, fearful of its  consequences to the Tasmanians, consented to their removal. In 1838, Mr.  Robinson received the appointment of Chief Protector to the Aborigines  of New Holland: the"]]]
