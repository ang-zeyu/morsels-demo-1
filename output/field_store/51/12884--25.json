[Footnote 105: In each province, or bashawick, there are           several alkaids or governors of districts.]             [Footnote 106: The city of Fas is the metropolis of the north,           as Marocco is of the south. Mequinas is the court town of the           north, and resembles the Hague, where few reside but such as           are employed in the service of the crown.]             [Footnote 107: This word was used by the seed, or emperor, in           the presumption that it is understood by Europeans; but _cadus_           is the Arabic term.]         There is near to the walls of Marocco, about the north-west point,       a village, called (_Deshira el Jeddam_) i.e. the Village of Lepers.       I had a curiosity to visit this village; but I was told that any       other excursion would be preferable; that the Lepers were totally       excluded from the rest of mankind; and that, although none of them       would dare to approach us, yet the excursion would be not only       unsatisfactory but disgusting. I was, however, determined to go; I       mounted my horse, and took two horse-guards with me, and my own       servant. We rode through the Lepers' town; the inhabitants  91   collected at the doors of their habitations, but did not approach       us; they, _for the most part_, showed no external disfiguration,       but were generally sallow; some of the young women were very       handsome; they have, however, a paucity of eyebrow, which, it must       be allowed, is somewhat incompatible with a beauty; some few had no       eyebrows at all, which completely destroyed the effect of their       dark animated eyes. They are obliged to wear a large straw hat,       with a brim about nine inches wide; this is their _badge of       separation_, a token of division between the clean and unclean,       which when seen in the country, or on the roads, prevents any one       from having personal contact with them. They are allowed to beg,       and accordingly are seen by the side of the roads, with their straw       hat badge, and a wooden bowl before them, to receive the charity of       passengers, exclaiming (_attanie m'ta Allah_) \"bestow on me the       property of God;\" (_kulshie m'ta Allah_) \"all belongs to God!\"       reminding the passenger that he is a steward of, and accountable       for the appropriation of his property; that he derives his property       from the bounty and favour of God. When any one gives them money,       they pronounce a blessing on him; as (_Allah e zeed kherik_) \"may       God increase your good,\" &c. The province of Haha abounds in       lepers; and it is said that the Arganic[108] oil, which, is much       used in food throughout this picturesque province, promotes this       loathsome disease!             [Footnote 108: This oil, which is excellent, and generally used           for frying fish, should be thus prepared, according to the           learned Doctor Barata, who was pensioned physician to the           _Commercio_ of Mogodor, by which preparation it becomes           perfectly wholesome, and deprived of any leprous or other bad           quality: Take a quart of Argan oil, and put in it a large onion           cut in slices; when it boils add a piece of crumb of bread,           equal in size to an onion, then let it boil a few minutes more,           take it off, let it cool, and strain the oil through a sieve,           and bottle it for daily use.]    92       The chain of Atlas, east of Marocco, continually covered with snow,       gives a pleasant coolness to the air of the city, in the summer       season, particularly in the morning and evening; the coolness is       generally said, however, to produce ophthalmia.[109] These       mountains are immensely high, and their magnitude makes them appear       not more than five miles from the city. It is, however, a day's       journey to the foot of them, after which the ascent is so gradual,       that it takes two days more to reach the snow. This part of the       chain of Atlas, east of the city of Marocco, is seen at sea, twenty       miles west of Mogodor, which latter place is about 120 miles from  93   Marocco; it is 35 miles from the city of Marocco to the foot of       Atlas; and it is two days' journey from the foot of Atlas to the       snow, which constantly covers the summit of these immense       mountains. They are thus seen at a distance of 245 miles:                  20 miles from land at sea.               120     do.    Mogodor to Marocco.                35     do.    Marocco to the foot of                                the mountains.                70     do.    the foot of Atlas to the snow.               ---       Seen at 245 miles distance.               ---             [Footnote 109: Ophthalmic disorders prevail among the Jews of           Marocco, but are seldom seen among the Moors. The Jews live in           great filth at Marocco; the dung-hills and ruins are in some           places as high as the houses. The Muhamedan doctrine does not           allow the Moors to neglect personal cleanliness, which, among           these people, is a cardinal virtue; and this, I presume, is the           cause of their being, in a great measure, exempt from           ophthalmia, whereas the Jews, on the contrary, are generally           affected with it.]         In this calculation, the direct distance in the ascent of the       mountain, is less than the travelling distance; but without taking       notice of the distance from the border of the snow to the summit of       this lofty mountain, which is said to be another day's journey, the       one may balance the other: we may therefore calculate 70 miles as       the direct longitudinal distance, although I am persuaded it is       much more from the foot to the summit of that part of the Atlas       which is visible at sea.         H.T. Colebrooke, Esq., in a paper inserted in the Asiatic       Transactions, vol. xii. asserts, that it requires an elevation of       28,000 feet, for an object to be visible at the distance of 200  94   geographical miles; now 245 English miles are equal to 211-1/2       geographical miles; consequently, if Mr. Colebrooke be correct, the       summit of Atlas, east of Marocco and Dimenet, which is seen at a       distance of 211-1/2 geographical miles, must be 29,610 feet high,       or above five miles and a half.         Again, the chain of Atlas in Lower Suse, which lies east of Elala,       and which is constantly covered with snow, is situated three days'       journey, horse travelling, east-south-east from Elala, in Lower       Suse; Elala is three days' journey from Santa Cruz, horse       travelling, making together 180 miles: add for distance from the       foot of the Elala mountains to the snow, 60 miles, and the Atlas in       Lower Suse will be seen at the distance of 240 miles, or 207       geographical miles.           Thus, from Santa Cruz to the     }       foot of the Atlas mountains, in the} 180 miles.       district of Elala, in Lower Suse   }           Add for distance from the foot   }       of the Elala mountains to the      }  60       snow                               }                                       ---         So that the Atlas in Lower Suse, }       being seen at a distance of        } 240         Or 207 geographical miles, must have an altitude of 28,980 feet.         On the north side of the city of Marocco is a gate called _Beb El       Khummes_, and near it is held, every Thursday, a market called soke       _El Khummes_; at which immense quantities of horses, camels, mules,       asses, oxen, sheep, goats, wheat and barley are sold; oils, gums,  95   almonds, dates, raisins, figs, bees' wax, honey, skins, &c. &c.       &c.; also, slaves, male and female. Such a horse as would cost in       London 50_l._, sells here for 50 dollars; a good mule sells for the       same, viz. 50 dollars; a bull, 12 dollars; a cow, 15 dollars;       sheep, a dollar and a half, each; a goat, a dollar. Very fine large       grained wheat, which increases one-fifth in the grinding, sells at       one dollar per saa, or about half a dollar per Winchester bushel.       The slaves are conducted through the market by the auctioneer       (_delel_), who exclaims, occasionally, (_khumseen reeal aal       zeeada_, i.e.) \"50 dollars on the increase,\" till he finds no one       will advance; when he goes to the owner and declares the price       offered; the owner then decides if he will sell or not; if he       sells, the money is paid immediately, but if not, he takes his       slave away with him, and tries him again the next market-day, or       waits in expectation that this wretched article of trade will rise       in value.         A stranger passing through Marocco would consider it an irregular       miserable town; but the despotic nature of the government induces       every individual to secrete or conceal his opulence; so that the       houses of the gentry are surrounded with a shabby wall, often       broken or out of repair, at a considerable distance from the       dwelling house, which does not appear, or is invisible to the       passenger. Some of these houses are very handsome, and are       furnished with couches, circular cushions to sit on, and other  96   furniture, in all the luxury of the East. When a visitor or a guest       enters one of these houses, slaves come in with perfumes burning,       in compliment to the visitor. Coffee and tea are then presented in       small cups, having an outer cup to hold that which contains the       liquor, instead of a saucer; the sugar being first put into the       pot. The coffee or tea being poured out, already sweetened with       sugar, a negro boy generally takes his station in one corner of a       spacious room, pours out the liquor, and sends it to the guests by    "]]]
