We dined and slept that night at a little Spanish hotel half built  out over the sea, Concha by name, and left the Grand Hotel de Palais  Miramar to those who like grand hotels. We lingered a fortnight at  Fontarabia, and did much that many tourists did not. One should see  Fontarabia and find out its delights for oneself. There is a  quaintness and unworldliness about its old streets and wharves, which  is indescribable in print; there is a wonderfully impressive expanse  of sea and sky on the Bay of Bidassoa, a couple of kilometres away,  and all sorts and conditions of men may find an occupation here for  any passing mood they may have.    We just missed the great fete of the eighth of September, when  processions, and bull-fights, and all the movement of the sacred and  profane rejoicings of the Latins yearly astonish the more phlegmatic  northerner.    Another great fete is that of Vendredi-Saint (Good Friday). Either  one or the other should be seen by all who may be in these parts at  these times.    Near by, in the middle of the swift-flowing current of the Bidassoa,  is the historically celebrated Ile des Faisans, on which the  conferences were held between the French minister Mazarin and the  Spanish Don Louis de Haro, which led to the famous Treaty of the  Pyrenees, 1659, and the marriage of Louis XIV. with the daughter of  Philip IV. The representative of each sovereign advanced from his own  territory, by a temporary bridge, to this bit of neutral ground,  which then reached nearly up to the present bridge. The piles which  supported the cardinal's pavilion were visible not many years ago.  The death of Velasquez, the painter, was caused by his exertions in  superintending these constructions; duties more fitting to an  upholsterer than a painter.    We finished our tour of the Pyrenees at Fontarabia, having followed  along the shadow of these great frontier mountains their entire  length; not wholly unknown ground, perhaps, but for the most part  entirely unspoiled, and, as a touring-ground for the automobilist,  without a peer.      Chapter III  In Languedoc And Old Provence    [Illustration: Languedoc & Provence]    The dim purple curtain of the Pyrenees had been drawn behind, us, and  we were passing from the patois of Languedoc to the patois of  Provence, where the peasants say _pardie_ in place of _pardou_ when  an exclamation of surprise comes from their lips.    Cast your eyes over the map of ancient France, and you will  distinguish plainly the lines of demarcation between the old  political divisions which, in truth, the traveller by road may find  to exist even to-day, in the manners and customs of the people at  least.    Unconsciously we drew away from the sleepy indolence of Perpignan and  Roussillon, and before we knew it had passed Narbonne, and on through  Beziers to Agde, where we proposed stopping for the night.    Quite as Spanish-looking as Perpignan, Agde was the very antithesis  of the gay and frivolous Catalan city. The aspect of its purple-brown  architecture, the bridge-piers crossing the Herault, and the very  pavements themselves were a colour-scheme quite unlike anything we  had seen elsewhere. Brilliant and warm as a painting of Velasquez,  there was nothing gaudy, and one could only dream of the time when  the Renaissance house-fronts sheltered lords and ladies of high  degree instead of itinerant automobilists and travelling salesmen.    The Hotel du Cheval Blanc was one of these. It is not a particularly  up-to-date hostelry, and there is a scant accommodation for  automobiles, but for all that it is good of its kind, and one dines  and sleeps well to the accompaniment of the rushing waters of the  river, at its very dooryard, on its way to the sea.    From Agde to Montpellier is fifty odd kilometres over the worst  stretch of roadway of the same length to be found in France, save  perhaps that awful paved road of Navarre across the Landes.    Montpellier is one of the most luxurious and well-kept small cities  of France. It is the seat of the prefecture, the assizes, and a  university--whose college of medicine was famous in the days of  Rabelais. It has the modern attributes of steam-heated,  electric-lighted hotels and restaurants, a tramway system that is  appalling and dangerous to all other traffic by reason of its  complexity, and an Opera House and a Hotel de Ville that would do  credit to a city ten times its size.    We merely took Montpellier _en route_, just as we had many other  places, and were really bound for Aigues-Mortes, where we proposed to  lunch: one would not willingly sleep in a place with a name like  that.    Of Aigues-Mortes Ch. Lentherie wrote, a quarter of a century ago:    \"The country round about is incomparably melancholy, the sun  scorches, and the sandy soil gives no nourishment to plants, flowers,  vines, or grain. Cultivated land does not exist, it is a desert:  ugly, melancholy, and abandoned. But Aigues-Mortes cannot, nay, must  not perish, and will always remain the old city of St. Louis, a  magnificent architectural diadem, with its deserted _plage_ an _aureole_  most radiant, a glorious yet touching reminder.\"    One other imaginative description is the poem of Charles Bigot on _La  Tour de Constance_, in which the Huguenot women were many long years  imprisoned. It is written in the charming Nimois patois, and runs  thus in its first few lines:      \"Tour de la simple et forte,    Simbol de glorie et de piete,    Tour de pauvres femmes mortes    Pour leur Dieu et la liberte.\"    These few introductory lines will recall to the memory of all who  know the history of the Crusades and of St. Louis the part played by  this old walled city of Aigues-Mortes.    More complete, and more frowning and grim, than Carcassonne, it has  not a tithe of its interest, but, for all that, it is the most  satisfying example of a walled stronghold of mediaeval times yet  extant.    With all its gloom, its bareness, and the few hundreds of shaking  pallid mortals which make up its present-day population, the marsh  city of Aigues-Mortes is a lively memory to all who have seen it.    One comes by road and drives his automobile in through the  battlemented gateway over the cobbled main street, or struggles up on  foot from the station of the puny and important little railway which  brings people down from Arles in something over an hour's time.  Ultimately, one and all arrive at the excellent Hotel St. Louis, and  eat bountifully of fresh fish of the Mediterranean, well cooked by  the _patron-chef_, and well served by a dainty Arlesienne maiden of  fifteen summers, who looks as though she might be twenty-two.    \"_C'est un chose a voir_\" every one tells you in the Bouches-du-Rhone  when you mention Aigues-Mortes; and truly it is. As before suggested,  you will not want to sleep within its dreary walls, but \"it's a thing  to see\" without question, and to get away from as soon as possible,  before a peculiarly vicious breed of mosquito inoculates you with the  toxic poison of the marshes.    Now we are approaching the land of the poet Mistral, the most  romantic region in all modern France, where the inhabitant in his  repose and his pleasure still lives in mediaeval times and chants and  dances himself (and herself) into a sort of semi-indifference to the  march of time.    The Crau and the Camargue, lying south of Arles between Aigues-Mortes  and the Etang de Berre, is the greatest fete-making _pays_, one might  think, in all the world.    How many times, from January to January, the Provencal \"makes the  fete\" it would be difficult to state--on every occasion possible, at  any rate.    The great fete of Provence is the day of the _ferrande_, a sort of a  cattle round-up held on the Camargue plain, something like what goes  on in \"_le Far West,_\" as the French call it, only on not so grand a  scale.    Mistral describes it of course:      \"On a great branding-day came this throng,    A help for the mighty herd-mustering,    Li Santo, Aigo Marto, Albaron,    And from Faraman, a hundred horses strong    Came out into the desert.\"    Here we were in the midst of the land of fetes, and if we could not  see a _ferrande_ in all its savage, unspoiled glory, we would see  what we could.    We were in luck, as we learned when we put into St. Gilles for the  night, and comfortably enough housed our auto in the _remise_ of the  company, or individual, which has the concession for the stage line  across the Camargue, which links up the two loose ends of a toy  railway, one of which ends at Aigues-Mortes, and the other at Stes.  Maries-de-la-Mer.    Our particular piece of luck was the opportunity to be present at the  pilgrimage to the shrine of the three Marys of Judea, which took  place on the morrow.    The poet Mistral sets it all out in romantic verse in his epic  \"Mireio,\" and one and all were indeed glad to embrace so fortunate an  opportunity of participating in one of the most nearly unique  pilgrimages and festivals in all the world.    We entered the little waterside town the next morning soon after  sunrise, _en auto_. Others came by rail, on foot, on horseback, or by  the slow-going _roulotte_, or caravan; pilgrims from all corners of  the earth, the peasant folk of Provence, the Arlesiens and  Arlesiennes, and the dwellers of the great Camargue plain.    The picture is quite as \"Mireio\" saw it in the poem: the vision of  the lone sentinel church by the sea, which rises above the dunes of  the Camargue to-day, as it did in the olden time.    \"'It looms at last in the distance dim,  She sees it grow on the horizon's rim,  The Saintes' white tower across the billowy plain,  Like vessel homeward bound upon the main.\"    On the dunes of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#19)"],[1,"wood-box and kept him captive for a week. Look in upon him  at any time, night or day, and he was apparently wrapped in the  profoundest slumber; but the live mice which I put into his box from  time to time found his sleep was easily broken; there would be a sudden  rustle in the box, a faint squeak, and then silence. After a week of  captivity I gave him his freedom in the full sunshine; no trouble for  him to see which way and where to go.    Just at dusk in the winter nights, I often hear his soft _bur-r-r-r_,  very pleasing and bell-like. What a furtive, woody sound it is in the  winter stillness, so unlike the harsh scream of the hawk! But all the  ways of the owl are ways of softness and duskiness. His wings are shod  with silence, his plumage is edged with down.    Another owl neighbor of mine, with whom I pass the time of day more  frequently than with the last, lives farther away. I pass his castle  every night on my way to the post-office, and in winter, if the hour is  late enough, am pretty sure to see him standing in his doorway,  surveying the passers-by and the landscape through narrow slits in his  eyes. For four successive winters now have I observed him. As the  twilight begins to deepen, he rises up out of his cavity in the  apple-tree, scarcely faster than the moon rises from behind the hill,  and sits in the opening, completely framed by its outlines of gray bark  and dead wood, and by his protective coloring virtually invisible to  every eye that does not know he is there. Probably my own is the only  eye that has ever penetrated his secret, and mine never would have done  so had I not chanced on one occasion to see him leave his retreat and  make a raid upon a shrike that was impaling a shrew-mouse upon a thorn  in a neighboring tree, and which I was watching. I was first advised of  the owl's presence by seeing him approaching swiftly on silent, level  wing. The shrike did not see him till the owl was almost within the  branches. He then dropped his game, and darted back into the thick  cover, uttering a loud, discordant squawk, as one would say, \"Scat!  scat! scat!\" The owl alighted, and was, perhaps, looking about him for  the shrike's impaled game, when I drew near. On seeing me, he reversed  his movement precipitately, flew straight back to the old tree, and  alighted in the entrance to the cavity. As I approached, he did not so  much seem to move as to diminish in size, like an object dwindling in  the distance; he depressed his plumage, and, with his eye fixed upon me,  began slowly to back and sidle into his retreat till he faded from my  sight. The shrike wiped his beak upon the branches, cast an eye down at  me and at his lost mouse, and then flew away.    A few nights afterward, as I passed that way, I saw the little owl again  sitting in his doorway, waiting for the twilight to deepen, and  undisturbed by the passers-by; but when I paused to observe him, he saw  that he was discovered, and he slunk back into his den as on the former  occasion. Ever since, while going that way, I have been on the lookout  for him. Dozens of teams and foot-passengers pass him late in the day,  but he regards them not, nor they him. When I come along and pause to  salute him, he opens his eyes a little wider, and, appearing to  recognize me, quickly shrinks and fades into the background of his door  in a very weird and curious manner. When he is not at his outlook, or  when he is, it requires the best powers of the eye to decide the point,  as the empty cavity itself is almost an exact image of him. If the whole  thing had been carefully studied, it could not have answered its purpose  better. The owl stands quite perpendicular, presenting a front of light  mottled gray; the eyes are closed to a mere slit, the ear-feathers  depressed, the beak buried in the plumage, and the whole attitude is one  of silent, motionless waiting and observation. If a mouse should be seen  crossing the highway, or scudding over any exposed part of the snowy  surface in the twilight, the owl would doubtless swoop down upon it. I  think the owl has learned to distinguish me from the rest of the  passers-by; at least, when I stop before him, and he sees himself  observed, he backs down into his den, as I have said, in a very amusing  manner.          THE CHICKADEE      The chickadees we have always with us. They are like the evergreens  among trees and plants. Winter has no terrors for them. They are  properly wood-birds, but the groves and orchards know them also. Did  they come near my cabin for better protection, or did they chance to  find a little cavity in a tree there that suited them? Branch-builders  and ground-builders are easily accommodated, but the chickadee must find  a cavity, and a small one at that. The woodpeckers make a cavity when a  suitable trunk or branch is found, but the chickadee, with its small,  sharp beak, rarely does so; it usually smooths and deepens one already  formed. This a pair did a few yards from my cabin. The opening was into  the heart of a little sassafras, about four feet from the ground. Day  after day the birds took turns in deepening and enlarging the cavity: a  soft, gentle hammering for a few moments in the heart of the little  tree, and then the appearance of the worker at the opening, with the  chips in his, or her, beak. They changed off every little while, one  working while the other gathered food. Absolute equality of the sexes,  both in plumage and in duties, seems to prevail among these birds, as  among a few other species. During the preparations for housekeeping the  birds were hourly seen and heard, but as soon as the first egg was laid,  all this was changed. They suddenly became very shy and quiet. Had it  not been for the new egg that was added each day, one would have  concluded that they had abandoned the place. There was a precious secret  now that must be well kept. After incubation began, it was only by  watching that I could get a glimpse of one of the birds as it came  quickly to feed or to relieve the other.    One day a lot of Vassar girls came to visit me, and I led them out to  the little sassafras to see the chickadee's nest. The sitting bird kept  her place as head after head, with its nodding plumes and millinery,  appeared above the opening to her chamber, and a pair of inquisitive  eyes peered down upon her. But I saw that she was getting ready to play  her little trick to frighten them away. Presently I heard a faint  explosion at the bottom of the cavity, when the peeping girl jerked her  head quickly back, with the exclamation, \"Why, it spit at me!\" The trick  of the bird on such occasions is apparently to draw in its breath till  its form perceptibly swells, and then give forth a quick, explosive  sound like an escaping jet of steam. One involuntarily closes his eyes  and jerks back his head. The girls, to their great amusement, provoked  the bird into this pretty outburst of her impatience two or three times.  But as the ruse failed of its effect, the bird did not keep it up, but  let the laughing faces gaze till they were satisfied.    I was much interested in seeing a brood of chickadees, reared on my  premises, venture upon their first flight. Their heads had been seen at  the door of their dwelling--a cavity in the limb of a pear-tree--at  intervals for two or three days. Evidently they liked the looks of the  great outside world; and one evening, just before sundown, one of them  came forth. His first flight was of several yards, to a locust, where he  alighted upon an inner branch, and after some chirping and calling  proceeded to arrange his plumage and compose himself for the night. I  watched him till it was nearly dark. He did not appear at all afraid  there alone in the tree, but put his head under his wing and settled  down for the night as if it were just what he had always been doing.  There was a heavy shower a few hours later, but in the morning he was  there upon his perch in good spirits.    I happened to be passing in the morning when another one came out. He  hopped out upon a limb, shook himself, and chirped and called loudly.  After some moments an idea seemed to strike him. His attitude changed,  his form straightened up, and a thrill of excitement seemed to run  through him. I knew what it all meant; something had whispered to the  bird, \"Fly!\" With a spring and a cry he was in the air, and made good  headway to a near hemlock. Others left in a similar manner during that  day and the next, till all were out.          THE DOWNY WOODPECKER      The bird that seems to consider he has the best right to my hospitality  is the downy woodpecker, my favorite neighbor among the winter birds.  His retreat is but a few paces from my own, in the decayed limb of an  apple-tree, which he excavated several autumns ago. I say \"he\" because  the red plume on the top of his head proclaims the sex. It seems not to  be generally known to our writers upon ornithology that certain of our  woodpeckers--probably all the winter residents--each fall excavate a  limb or the trunk of a tree in which to pass the winter, and that the  cavity is abandoned in the spring, probably for a new one in which  nidification takes place.    The particular woodpecker to which I refer drilled his first hole in my  apple-tree one fall four or five years ago. This he occupied till the  following spring, when he abandoned it. The next fall he began a hole in  an adjoining limb, later than before, and when it was about half  completed a female took possession of his old quarters. I am sorry to  say that this seemed to enrage the male very much, and he persecuted the  poor bird whenever she appeared upon the scene. He would fly at her  spitefully and drive her off. One chilly November morning, as I passed  under the tree, I heard the hammer of the little architect in his  cavity, and at the same time saw the persecuted female sitting at the  entrance of the "]]]
