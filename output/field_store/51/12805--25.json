Now although it neither were their _Hopes_, or in their prospect to  _consummate_ a _Design_ requiring so _mighty Aids_, (inviron'd as they  have been with these Prejudices) yet have they not at all _desisted_  from the _Enterprize_; but rather than so Noble and Illustrious an  _Undertaking_ should not proceed for want of some generous and  industrious _Spirits_ to promote the _Work_; they have _themselves_  submitted to those mean _Imployments_, of _digging_ in the very  _Quarry_; yea even and of making _Brick_ where there was no _Straw_, but  what they gleaned, and lay dispersed up and down: Nor did they think  their Pains yet _ill bestow'd_, if through the assiduous _Labour_, and a  _Train_ of continual _Experiments_, they might at last furnish, and  leave solid and uncorrupt _Materials_ to a _succeeding_, and more  _grateful Age_, for the _building up_ a _Body_ of _real_ and  _substantial Philosophy_, which should never _succumb_ to _Time_, but  with the _Ruines_ of _Nature_, and the _World_ it self.    In order to _this_, how many, and almost _innumerable_ have been their  _Tryals_ and _Experiments_, through the large and ample Field both of  _Art_ and _Nature_? We call our _Journals_, _Registers_,  _Correspondence_, and _Transactions_, to witness; and may with modesty  provoke all our _Systematical Methodists_, _Natural Histories_, and  _Pretenders_ hitherto extant from the _beginning_ of _Letters_, to this  _period_, to shew us so _ample_, so _worthy_ and so _useful_ a  Collection. 'Tis a _Fatality_ and an _Injury_ to be deplored, that those  who give us _hard words_, will not first vouchsafe _impartially_ to  _examine_ these _particulars_; since all _Ingenuous Spirits_ could not  but be abundantly _satisfied_, that this _Illustrious Assembly_ has not  met so many _Years_ purely for _Speculation_ only; though I take even  _that_ to be no ignoble _Culture_ of the _Mind_, or time mispent for  Persons who have so few _Friends_, and slender _Obligations_, to those  who should _Patronize_ and _Encourage_ them: But they have aimed at  _greater things_, and _greater things_ produc'd, namely, by  _Emancipating_, and freeing themselves from the _Tyranny_ of _Opinion_,  _delusory_ and fallacious shews, to receive nothing upon _Trust_, but  bring it to the _Lydian Touch_, make it pass the _Fire_, the _Anvil_ and  the _File_, till it come forth perfectly _repurged_, and of consistence.  They are not hasty in _concluding_ from a _single_, or _incompetent_  number of _Experiments_, to pronounce the _Ecstatic Heureca_, and offer  _Hecatombs_; but, after the most diligent _Scrutiny_, and by degrees,  and wary _Inductions_ _honestly_ and _faithfully_ made, to _record_ the  _Truth_, and event of _Tryals_, and transmit them to _Posterity_. They  resort not immediately to _general Propositions_, upon every _specious  appearance_; but stay for _Light_, and Information from _Particulars_,  and make Report _de Facto_, and as _Sense_ informs them. They reject no  _Sect_ of _Philosophers_, no _Mechanic_ Helps, _except_ no _Persons_ of  Men; but chearfully embracing _all_, cull out of _all_, and alone  _retain_ what abides the _Test_; that from a plentiful and well  furnish'd _Magazine_ of true _Experiments_, they may in time advance to  solemn and established _Axiomes_, _General Rules_ and _Maximes_; and a  _Structure_ may indeed lift up its head, such as may stand the shock of  _Time_, and render a solid accompt of the _Phaenomena_, and _Effects_ of  _Nature_, the _Aspectable Works of God_, and their _Combinations_; so as  by _Causes_ and _Effects_, _certain_ and _useful_ Consequences may be  deduced. Therefore they do not fill their _Papers_ with _Transcripts_  out of _Rhapsodists_, _Mountebancs_, and Compilers of _Receipts_ and  _Secrets_, to the loss of Oil and Labour; but as it were, _eviscerating_  Nature, disclosing the _Ressorts_, and Springs of _Motion_, have  _collected_ innumerable _Experiments_, _Histories_ and _Discourses_; and  brought in _Specimens_ for the Improvement of _Astronomy_, _Geography_,  _Navigation_, _Optics_; all the Parts of _Agriculture_, the _Garden_ and  the _Forest_; _Anatomy_ of _Plants_, and _Animals_; _Mines_ and _Ores_;  _Measures_ and _AEquations_ of _Time_ by accurate _Pendulums_, and other  Motions, _Hydro_- and _Hygrostatics_, divers _Engines_, Powers and  _Automata_, with innumerable more _luciferous_ particulars, subservient  to human life, of which Dr. _Glanvil_ has given an ample and ingenious  _Accompt_ in his learned Essay: And _since_ in the _Posthumous_ Works of  Dr. _Hooke_, lately publish'd by the most obliging Mr. _Waller_, already  mention'd.    This is (_Reader_) what they have done; and they are but _part_ of the  _Materials_ which the _Society_ have hitherto _amassed_, and prepared  for this great and _Illustrious Work_; not to pass over an infinity of  _solitary_, and loose _Experiments_ subsidiary to it, gathered at no  small Pains and Cost: For so have they hitherto born the _Burden and  Heat of the day alone_; _Sapping_ and _Mining_ to lay the _Foundation_  deep, and raise a _Superstructure_ to be one day perfected, by the joint  _Endeavours_ of those who shall in a _kinder_ Age have little else to  do, but the _putting_ and _cementing_ of the _Parts_ together, which to  _collect_ and fit, have cost them so much Solicitude and Care. _Solomon_  indeed built the glorious _Temple_; but 'twas _David_ provided the  _Materials_: Did Men in those days insolently ask, _What he had done_,  in all the time of that tedious preparation? I beseech you what  _Obligation_ has the _R. Society_ to render an _Accompt_ of their  Proceedings to _any_ who are not of the _Body_, and that carry on the  _Work_ at their own _expence_ amidst so many Contradictions? It is an  _Evil Spirit_, and an _Evil Age_, which having sadly _debauch'd_ the  _Minds_ of Men; seeks with Industry to blast and undermine all  _Attempts_ and Endeavours that signifie to the Illustration of _Truth_,  the discovery of _Impostors_, and shake their sandy Foundations.    _Those who come (_says the noble _Verulam__) to enquire after _Knowledge_,  with a mind to _scorn_, shall be sure to find matter for their _Humor_;  but none for their _Instruction_: _Would_ Men bring light of _Invention_,  and not fire-brands of _Contradiction_, Knowledge would infinitely  increase._ But these are the _Sanballats_ and _Horonites_ who disturb our  Men upon the Wall{xciii:1}: But, _let us rise up and build_, and be no  more discourag'd. 'Tis impossible to conceive, how so honest, and worthy a  _Design_ should have found so few _Promoters_, and cold a welcome in a  _Nation_ whose _Eyes_ are so wide open: We see how greedily the _French_,  and other _Strangers_ embrace and cultivate the _Design_: What sumptuous  _Buildings_, well furnish'd _Observatories_, ample _Appointments_,  _Salaries_, and _Accommodations_, they have erected to carry on the Work;  whilst we live _precariously_, and spin the _Web_ out of our own _Bowels_.  Indeed we have had the Honour to be the _first_ who led the _way_, given  the _Ferment_, which like a _Train_ has taken _Fire_, and warm'd the  _Regions_ all about us. _This Glory, doubtless, shall none take from us_:  But whilst they flourish so _abroad_, we want the _Spirit_ should diffuse  it here at _home_, and give progress to so hopeful a _beginning_: But as  we said, the _Enemy_ of _Mankind_ has done us this despite; it is his  Interest to impeach (in any sort) what e're opposes his _Dominion_; which  is to lead, and settle Men in _Errors_ as well in _Arts_ and _Natural  Knowledge_, as in _Religion_; and therefore would be glad, the World  should still be _groping_ after _both_. 'Tis _he_ that sets the  _Buffoons_, and empty _Sycophants_, to turn all that's _Great_ and  _Virtuous_ into _Raillery_ and Derision: 'Tis therefore to encounter  _these_, that like those resolute _Builders_,{xciii:2} whilst we employ  one hand in the Work, _we_, with the _other_ are oblig'd to hold our  _Weapon_, till some bold, and _Gallant Genius_ deliver us, and raise the  Siege. How gloriously would such a _Benefactor_ shine! What a  _Constellation_ would he make! How great a _Name_ establish! For mine own  part (_Religiously_ I _profess_ it) were I not a _Person_, who (whilst I  stood expecting when others more worthy, and able than my self, should  have snatch'd the Opportunity of _signalizing_ a Work worthy of  _Immortality_) had long since given _Hostages_ to _Fortune_, and so put my  self out of a Capacity of shewing my _Affection_ to a _Design_ so  glorious; I would not only most chearfully have _contributed_ towards the  freeing it from the _Straits_ it has so long struggl'd under; but  _sacrific'd_ all my _Secular Interests_ in their Service: But, as I said,  this is reserv'd for that Gallant _Hero_ (whoe'er it be) that truly  weighing the noble and universal _Consequence_ of so high an _Enterprize_,  shall at last free it of these _Reproaches_; and either set it above the  reach of _Envy_, or convert it to _Emulation_.

He  will separate thee from this present life, as the vintager gathers  the cluster that would have rotted on the tree, and bears it to the  wine-press to change it into perfumed wine. Listen! there is, a dozen  hours from Alexandria, towards the west, not far from the sea, a  nunnery, the rules of which, a masterpiece of wisdom, deserve to be put  in lyric verse and sung to the sound of the theorbo and tambourines.  It may truly be said that the women who are there, submissive to these  rules, have their feet upon earth and their faces in heaven. They desire  to be poor, that Jesus may love them, modest, that He may gaze upon  them; chaste that He may wed them. He visits them every day in the  guise of a gardener, His feet bare, His beautiful hands open--even as He  showed Himself to Mary at the entrance of the tomb. I will conduct thee  this very day to this nunnery, my Thais, and soon, commingling with  these holy women, thou wilt share in their heavenly conversation. They  await thee as a sister. On the threshold of the convent, their mother,  the pious Albina, will give thee the kiss of peace and will say, 'My  daughter, thou art welcome!'\"    The courtesan uttered a cry of amazement.    \"Albina! a daughter of the Caesars! The great niece of the Emperor  Carus!\"    \"She herself! Albina, who, born in the purple, has donned the serge,  and a daughter of the masters of this world, has risen to the rank of  servant of Jesus Christ. She will be thy mother.\"    Thais rose and said--    \"Take me to the house of Albina.\"    And Paphnutius, completing his victory--    \"Surely I will conduct thee thither, and there I will place thee in a  cell, where thou shalt weep for thy sins. For it is not fitting that  thou shouldst mingle with the daughters of Albina until thou art  cleansed from thy sins. I will seal the door, and there, a happy  prisoner, thou wilt wait in tears till Jesus Himself come, as a sign of  pardon, to break the seal that I have placed. And doubt not that He will  come, Thais, and how the flesh of thy soul will tremble when thou shalt  feel the fingers of Light placed upon thy eyes to dry thy tears!\"    Thais said a second time--    \"Take me, my father, to the house of Albina.\"    His heart filled with joy, Paphnutius gazed around him, and tasted,  almost without fear, the pleasure of contemplating the works of  creation; his eyes drank in with joy God's light, and unknown breezes  fanned his cheeks. Suddenly, seeing at one of the corners of the public  square the little door which led to Thais' house, and remembering that  the trees, whose foliage he had been admiring, shaded the courtesan's  garden, he thought of all the impurities which there sullied the air,  to-day so light and pure, and his soul was so grieved that bitter tears  sprang to his eyes.    \"Thais,\" he said, \"we must fly without looking back. But we must not  leave behind us the instruments, the witnesses, the accomplices of thy  past crimes; those heavy hangings, those beds, carpets, perfume censers  and lamps, which would proclaim thy infamy! Dost thou wish that,  animated by the demons, and carried by the evil spirit that is in them,  those accursed belongings should pursue thee even to the desert? It is  but too true that there are tables which bring ruin, seats which serve  as the instruments of devils, which act, speak, strike the ground, and  pass through the air. Let all perish which has seen thy shame! Hasten,  Thais, and, whilst the city is yet asleep, order thy slaves to make,  in the centre of this place, a pile, upon which we will burn all the  abominable riches thy dwelling contains.\"    Thais consented.    \"Do as you will, my father,\" she said. \"I know that spirits often dwell  in inanimate objects. At night some articles of furniture talk, either  by giving knocks at regular intervals or by emitting little flashes of  light as signals. And even more. Have you remarked, my father, at the  entrance to the Grotto of Nymphs, on the right, a statue of a naked  woman about to bathe? One day I saw, with my own eyes, that statue turn  its head like a living person, and then return to its ordinary attitude.  I was terrified. Nicias, to whom I related this prodigy, laughed at  me; yet there must be some magic in that statue, for it inspired with  violent desires a certain Dalmatian, who was insensible to my beauty.  It is certain that I have lived amongst enchanted things, and that I  was exposed to the greatest perils, for men have been strangled by the  embraces of a bronze statue. Yet it would be a pity to destroy valuable  works made with rare skill, and to burn my carpets and tapestry would be  a great loss. The beautiful colours of some of them are truly wonderful,  and they cost much money to those who gave them to me. I also possess  cups, statues, and pictures of great price. I do not think they ought to  perish. But you know what is necessary. Do as you will, my father.\"    Thus saying, she followed the monk to the little door at which so many  garlands and wreaths had been hung, and, when it was opened, she told  the porter to call together all the slaves in the house. Four Indians,  who were employed in the kitchen, were the first to appear. They were  all four yellow men, and each had but one eye. It had cost Thais much  trouble, and given her amusement, to get together these four slaves  of the same race, and all afflicted with the same infirmity. When they  attended at table they excited the curiosity of the guests, and Thais  made them relate the story of their lives. These four waited in silence.  Their assistants followed them. Then came the stablemen, the huntsmen,  the litter-bearers, and the running footmen with muscles like iron, two  gardeners hirsute as Priapus, six ferocious looking negroes, three Greek  slaves--one a grammarian, another a poet, and the third a singer. They  all stood, ranged in order, on the public square, and were presently  joined by the negresses--curious, suspicious, rolling big round eyes,  and each with a huge mouth slit to her earrings. Lastly, adjusting their  veils and languidly dragging their feet, which were shackled with light  gold chains, appeared six sulky-looking, beautiful white slave-girls.  When they were all assembled, Thais, pointing to Paphnutius, said--    \"Do whatever this man commands you; for the spirit of God is in him, and  if you disobey him you will fall dead.\"    For she had heard, and really believed, that the earth would open and  swallow up in flames and smoke any impious wretch whom a saint of the  desert struck with his staff.    Paphnutius sent away the women and the Greek men-slaves, and said to the  others--    \"Bring wood to the middle of this place, make a huge fire, and throw  into it pell-mell all that there is in the house and grotto.\"    They were astonished, and stood motionless, looking at their mistress.  And they still stood inactive and silent, and pressed against each  other, elbow to elbow, suspecting that the order was a joke.    \"Obey!\" said the monk.    Several of them were Christians. They understood the command, and went  to the house to fetch wood and torches. The others were not indisposed  to imitate them, for, being poor, they hated riches and had a natural  instinct for destruction. Whilst they were building the pile, Paphnutius  said to Thais--    \"I thought at one time of fetching the treasurer of one of the churches  of Alexandria (if there still remain one worthy of the name of church,  and that is not defiled by the Arian beasts) and giving him thy goods,  woman, that he might distribute them to widows, and change the proceeds  of crime into the treasure of justice. But such a thought did not come  from God, and I cast it from me, for assuredly it would be a great  offence to the well-beloved of Jesus Christ to offer them the spoils  of thy lust. Thais, all that thou hast touched must be devoured by  the fire, even to its very soul. Thanks be to Heaven, these tunics and  veils, which have seen kisses more innumerable than the waves of the  sea, will only feel now the lips and tongues of the flames. Hasten,  slaves! More wood! More links and torches! And thou, woman, return to  thy house, strip thyself of thy shameful robes, and ask of the most  humble of thy slaves, as an undeserving favour, the tunic that she puts  on when she scrubs the floors.\"    Thais obeyed. Whilst the Indians knelt down and blew the embers, the  negroes threw on the pile coffers of ivory, ebony, or cedar, which broke  open and let out wreaths, garlands, and necklaces. The smoke rose in a  dark column, as in the holocausts of the old religion. Then the fire,  which had been smouldering, burst out suddenly with a roar as of some  monstrous animal, and the almost invisible flames began to devour their  valuable prey. The slaves worked more eagerly; they joyfully dragged out  rich carpets, veils embroidered with silver, and flowered tapestry. They  staggered under the weight of tables, couches, thick cushions, and  beds with gold nails. Three strong Ethiopians came hugging the coloured  statues of the nymphs, one of which had been loved as though it were a  mortal; and they looked like huge apes carrying off women. And when the  beautiful naked forms fell from the arms of these monsters, and were  broken on the stones, a deep groan was heard.    At that moment Thais appeared, her hair unloosed and streaming over her  shoulders, barefooted, and clad in a clumsy coarse garment which seemed  redolent with divine voluptuousness merely from having touched her body.  Behind her came a gardener, carrying, half hidden in his long beard, an  ivory Eros.    She made a sign to the man to stop, and approaching Paphnutius, showed  him the little god.    \"My father,\" she asked, \"should this also be thrown into the flames? It  is of marvellous antique work, and is"]]]
