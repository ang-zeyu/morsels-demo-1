BRIC A BRAC (a French word, formed by a kind of onomatopoeia, meaning a  heterogeneous collection of odds and ends; cf. _de bric et de broc_,  corresponding to our \"by hook or by crook\"; or by reduplication from  _brack_, refuse), objects of \"virtu,\" a collection of old furniture, china,  plate and curiosities.    BRICK (derived according to some etymologists from the Teutonic _bricke_, a  disk or plate; but more authoritatively, through the French _brique_,  originally a \"broken piece,\" applied especially to bread, and so to clay,  from the Teutonic _brikan_, to break), a kind of artificial stone generally  made of burnt clay, and largely used as a building material.    _History_.--The art of making bricks dates from very early times, and was  practised by all the civilized nations of antiquity. The earliest burnt  bricks known are those found on the sites of the ancient cities of  Babylonia, and it seems probable that the method of making strong and  durable bricks, by burning blocks of dried clay, was discovered in this  corner of Asia. We know at least that well-burnt bricks were made by the  Babylonians more than 6000 years ago, and that they were extensively used  in the time of Sargon of Akkad (c. 3800 B.C.). The site of the ancient city  of Babylon is still marked by huge mounds of bricks, the ruins of its great  walls, towers and palaces, although it has been the custom for centuries to  carry away from these heaps the bricks required for the building of the  modern towns in the surrounding country. The Babylonians and Assyrians  attained to a high degree of proficiency in brickmaking, notably in the  manufacture of bricks having a coating of coloured glaze or enamel, which  they largely used for wall decoration. The Chinese claim great antiquity  for their clay industries, but it is not improbable that the knowledge of  brickmaking travelled eastwards from Babylonia across the whole of Asia. It  is believed that the art of making glazed bricks, so highly developed  afterwards by the Chinese, found its way across Asia from the west, through  Persia and northern India, to China. The great wall of China was  constructed partly of brick, both burnt and unburnt; but this was built at  a comparatively late period (c. 210 B.C.), and there is nothing to show  that the Chinese had any knowledge of burnt bricks when the art flourished  in Babylonia.    Brickmaking formed the chief occupation of the Israelites during their  bondage in Egypt, but in this case the bricks were probably sun-dried only,  and not burnt. These bricks were made of a mixture of clay and chopped  straw or reeds, worked into a stiff paste with water. The clay was the  river mud from the banks of the Nile, and as this had not sufficient  cohesion in itself, the chopped straw (or reeds) was added as a binding  material. The addition of such substances increases the plasticity of wet  clay, especially if the mixture is allowed to stand for some days before  use; so that the action of the chopped straw was twofold; a fact possibly  known to the Egyptians. These sun-dried bricks, or \"adobes,\" are still  made, as of old, on the banks of the Nile by the following method:--A  shallow pit or bed is prepared, into which are thrown the mud, chopped  straw and water in suitable proportions, and the whole mass is tramped on  until it is thoroughly mixed and of the proper consistence. This mixture is  removed in lumps and shaped into bricks, in moulds or by hand, the bricks  being simply sun-dried.    Pliny mentions that three kinds of bricks were made by the Greeks, but  there is no indication that they were used to any great extent, and  probably the walls of Athens on the side towards Mount Hymettus were the  most important brick-structures in ancient Greece. The Romans became  masters of the brickmaker's art, though they probably acquired much of  their knowledge in the East, during their occupation of Egypt and Greece.  In any case they revived and extended the manufacture of bricks about the  beginning of the Christian era; exercising great care in the selection and  preparation of their clay, and introducing the method of burning bricks in  kilns. They carried their knowledge and their methods throughout western  Europe, and there is abundant evidence that they made bricks extensively in  Germany and in Britain.    Although brickmaking was thus introduced into Britain nearly 2000 years  ago, the art seems to have been lost when the Romans withdrew from the  country, and it is doubtful whether any burnt bricks were made in England  from that time until the 13th century. Such bricks as were used during this  long [v.04 p.0518] period were generally taken from the remains of Roman  buildings, as at Colchester and St Albans Abbey. One of the earliest  existing brick buildings, erected after the revival of brickmaking in  England, is Little Wenham Hall, in Suffolk, built about A.D. 1210; but it  was not until the 15th century that bricks came into general use again, and  then only for important edifices. During the reign of Henry VIII.  brickmaking was brought to great perfection, probably by workmen brought  from Flanders, and the older portions of St James's Palace and Hampton  Court Palace remain to testify to the skill then attained. In the 16th  century bricks were increasingly used, but down to the Great Fire of  London, in 1666, the smaller buildings, shops and dwelling-houses, were  constructed of timber framework filled in with lath and plaster. In the  rebuilding of London after the fire, bricks were largely used, and from the  end of the 17th century to the present day they have been almost  exclusively used in all ordinary buildings throughout the country, except  in those districts where building stone is plentiful and good brick-clay is  not readily procurable. The bricks made in England before 1625 were of many  sizes, there being no recognized standard; but in that year the sizes were  regulated by statute, and the present standard size was adopted, viz. 9 x  41/2 x 3 in. In 1784 a tax was levied on bricks, which was not repealed until  1850. The tax averaged about 4s. 7d. per thousand on ordinary bricks, and  special bricks were still more heavily taxed.    The first brick buildings in America were erected on Manhattan Island in  the year 1633 by a governor of the Dutch West India Company. These bricks  were made in Holland, where the industry had long reached great excellence;  and for many years bricks were imported into America from Holland and from  England. In America burnt bricks were first made at New Haven about 1650,  and the manufacture slowly spread through the New England states; but for  many years the home-made article was inferior to that imported from Europe.    The Dutch and the Germans were the great brickmakers of Europe during the  middle ages, although the Italians, from the 14th to the 15th century,  revived and developed the art of decorative brick-work or terra-cotta, and  discovered the method of applying coloured enamels to these materials.  Under the Della Robbias, in the 15th century, some of the finest work of  this class that the world has seen was executed, but it can scarcely be  included under brickwork.    _Brick Clays_.--All clays are the result of the denudation and  decomposition of felspathic and siliceous rocks, and consist of the fine  insoluble particles which have been carried in suspension in water and  deposited in geologic basins according to their specific gravity and degree  of fineness (see CLAY). These deposits have been formed in all geologic  epochs from the \"Recent\" to the \"Cambrian,\" and they vary in hardness from  the soft and plastic \"alluvial\" clays to the hard and rock-like shales and  slates of the older formations. The alluvial and drift clays (which were  alone used for brickmaking until modern times) are found near the surface,  are readily worked and require little preparation, whereas the older  sedimentary deposits are often difficult to work and necessitate the use of  heavy machinery. These older shales, or rocky clays, may be brought into  plastic condition by long weathering (_i.e._ by exposure to rain, frost and  sun) or by crushing and grinding in water, and they then resemble ordinary  alluvial clays in every respect.    The clays or earths from which burnt bricks are made may be divided into  two principal types, according to chemical composition: (1) Clays or shales  containing only a small percentage of carbonate of lime and consisting  chiefly of hydrated aluminium silicates (the \"true clay substance\") with  more or less sand, undecomposed grains of felspar, and oxide or carbonate  of iron; these clays usually burn to a buff, salmon or red colour; (2)  Clays containing a considerable percentage of carbonate of lime in addition  to the substances above mentioned. These latter clay deposits are known as  \"marls,\"[1] and may contain as much as 40% of chalk. They burn to a  sulphur-yellow colour which is quite distinctive.    Brick clays of class (1) are very widely distributed, and have a more  extensive geological range than the marls, which are found in connexion  with chalk or limestone formations only. These ordinary brick clays vary  considerably in composition, and many clays, as they are found in nature,  are unsuitable for brickmaking without the addition of some other kind of  clay or sand. The strongest brick clays, _i.e._ those possessing the  greatest plasticity and tensile strength, are usually those which contain  the highest percentage of the hydrated aluminium silicates, although the  exact relation of plasticity to chemical composition has not yet been  determined. This statement cannot be applied indiscriminately to all clays,  but may be taken as fairly applicable to clays of one general type (see  CLAY).

The moonlight did  not penetrate to the apartment in which he stood, and the darkness  about him was impenetrable.    But the clinging fingers did not release their hold, and vaguely aware  that he was acting in a manner which might readily be misconstrued, he  nevertheless allowed his unseen guide to lead him forward.    Stairs were descended in phantom silence--many stairs. The coolness of  the air suggested that they were outside the hotel. But the darkness  remained complete. Along what seemed to be a stone-paved passage they  advanced mysteriously, and by this time Dr. Cairn was wholly resigned  to the strangeness of his dream.    Then, although the place lay in blackest shadow, he saw that they were  in the open air, for the starry sky swept above them.    It was a narrow street--at points, the buildings almost met  above--wherein, he now found himself. In reality, had he been in  possession of his usual faculties, awake, he would have asked himself  how this veiled woman had gained admittance to the hotel, and why she  had secretly led him out from it. But the dreamer's mental lethargy  possessed him, and, with the blind faith of a child, he followed on,  until he now began vaguely to consider the personality of his guide.    She seemed to be of no more than average height, but she carried  herself with unusual grace, and her progress was marked by a certain  hauteur. At the point where a narrow lane crossed that which they were  traversing the veiled figure was silhouetted for a moment against the  light of the moon, and through the gauze-like fabric, he perceived the  outlines of a perfect shape. His vague wonderment, concerned itself  now with the ivory, jewel-laden hands. His condition differed from the  normal dream state, in that he was not entirely resigned to the  anomalous.    Misty doubts were forming, when his dream guide paused before a heavy  door of a typical native house which once had been of some  consequence, and which faced the entrance to a mosque, indeed lay in  the shadow of the minaret. It was opened from within, although she  gave no perceptible signal, and its darkness, to Dr. Cairn's dulled  perceptions, seemed to swallow them both up. He had an impression of a  trap raised, of stone steps descended, of a new darkness almost  palpable.    The gloom of the place effected him as a mental blank, and, when a  bright light shone out, it seemed to mark the opening of a second dream  phase. From where the light came, he knew not, cared not, but it  illuminated a perfectly bare room, with a floor of native mud bricks, a  plastered wall, and wood-beamed ceiling. A tall sarcophagus stood  upright against the wall before him; its lid leant close beside it ...  and his black robed guide, her luminous eyes looking straightly over the  yashmak, stood rigidly upright-within it!    She raised the jewelled hands, and with a swift movement discarded  robe and _yashmak_, and stood before him, in the clinging draperies of  an ancient queen, wearing the leopard skin and the _uraeus_, and  carrying the flail of royal Egypt!    Her pale face formed a perfect oval; the long almond eyes had an evil  beauty which seemed to chill; and the brilliantly red mouth was curved  in a smile which must have made any man forget the evil in the eyes.  But when we move in a dream world, our emotions become dreamlike too.  She placed a sandalled foot upon the mud floor and stepped out of the  sarcophagus, advancing towards Dr. Cairn, a vision of such sinful  loveliness as he could never have conceived in his waking moments. In  that strange dream language, in a tongue not of East nor West, she  spoke; and her silvern voice had something of the tone of those  Egyptian pipes whose dree fills the nights upon the Upper Nile--the  seductive music of remote and splendid wickedness.    \"You know me, _now_?\" she whispered.    And in his dream she seemed to be a familiar figure, at once dreadful  and worshipful.    A fitful light played through the darkness, and seemed to dance upon a  curtain draped behind the sarcophagus, picking out diamond points. The  dreamer groped in the mental chaos of his mind, and found a clue to  the meaning of this. The diamond points were the eyes of thousands of  tarantula spiders with which the curtain was broidered.    The sign of the spider! What did he know of it? Yes! of course; it was  the secret mark of Egypt's witch-queen--of the beautiful woman whose  name, after her mysterious death, had been erased from all her  monuments. A sweet whisper stole to his ears:    \"You will befriend him, befriend my son--for _my_ sake.\"    And in his dream-state he found himself prepared to foreswear all that  he held holy--for her sake. She grasped both his hands, and her  burning eyes looked closely into his.    \"Your reward shall be a great one,\" she whispered, even more softly.    Came a sudden blank, and Dr. Cairn found himself walking again through  the narrow street, led by the veiled woman. His impressions were  growing dim; and now she seemed less real than hitherto. The streets  were phantom streets, built of shadow stuff, and the stairs which  presently he found himself ascending, were unsubstantial, and he  seemed rather to float upward; until, with the jewelled fingers held  fast in his own, he stood in a darkened apartment, and saw before him  an open window, knew that he was once more back in the hotel. A dim  light dawned in the blackness of the room and the musical voice  breathed in his ear:    \"Your reward shall be easily earned. I did but test you. Strike--and  strike truly!\"    The whisper grew sibilant--serpentine. Dr. Cairn felt the hilt of a  dagger thrust into his right hand, and in the dimly-mysterious light  looked down at one who lay in a bed close beside him.    At sight of the face of the sleeper--the perfectly-chiselled face,  with the long black lashes resting on the ivory cheeks--he forgot all  else, forgot the place wherein he stood, forgot his beautiful guide,  and only remembered that he held a dagger in his hand, and that Antony  Ferrara lay there, sleeping!    \"Strike!\" came the whisper again.    Dr. Cairn felt a mad exultation boiling up within him. He raised his  hand, glanced once more on the face of the sleeper, and nerved himself  to plunge the dagger into the heart of this evil thing.    A second more, and the dagger would have been buried to the hilt in  the sleeper's breast--when there ensued a deafening, an appalling  explosion. A wild red light illuminated the room, the building seemed  to rock. Close upon that frightful sound followed a cry so piercing  that it seemed to ice the blood in Dr. Cairn's veins.    \"Stop, sir, stop! My God! what are you doing!\"    A swift blow struck the dagger from his hand and the figure on the bed  sprang upright. Swaying dizzily, Dr. Cairn stood there in the  darkness, and as the voice of awakened sleepers reached his ears from  adjoining rooms, the electric light was switched on, and across the  bed, the bed upon which he had thought Antony Ferrara lay, he saw his  son, Robert Cairn!    No one else was in the room. But on the carpet at his feet lay an  ancient dagger, the hilt covered with beautiful and intricate gold and  enamel work.    Rigid with a mutual horror, these two so strangely met stood staring  at one another across the room. Everyone in the hotel, it would  appear, had been awakened by the explosion, which, as if by the  intervention of God, had stayed the hand of Dr. Cairn--had spared him  from a deed impossible to contemplate.    There were sounds of running footsteps everywhere; but the origin of  the disturbance at that moment had no interest for these two. Robert  was the first to break the silence.    \"Merciful God, sir!\" he whispered huskily, \"how did you come to be  here? What is the matter? Are you ill?\"    Dr. Cairn extended his hands like one groping in darkness.    \"Rob, give me a moment, to think, to collect myself. Why am I here? By  all that is wonderful, why are _you_ here?\"    \"I am here to meet you.\"    \"To meet me! I had no idea that you were well enough for the journey,  and if you came to meet me, why--\"    \"That's it, sir! Why did you send me that wireless?\"    \"I sent no wireless, boy!\"    Robert Cairn, with a little colour returning to his pale cheeks,  advanced and grasped his father's hand.    \"But after I arrived here to meet the boat, sir I received a wireless  from the P. and O. due in the morning, to say that you had changed  your mind, and come _via_ Brindisi.\"    Dr. Cairn glanced at the dagger upon the carpet, repressed a shudder,  and replied in a voice which he struggled to make firm:    \"_I_ did not send that wireless!\"    \"Then you actually came by the boat which arrived last night?--and to  think that I was asleep in the same hotel! What an amazing--\"    \"Amazing indeed, Rob, and the result of a cunning and well planned  scheme.\" He raised his eyes, looking fixedly at his son. \"You  understand the scheme; the scheme that could only have germinated in  one mind--a scheme to cause me, your father, to--\"    His voice failed and again his glance sought the weapon which lay so  close to his feet. Partly in order to hide his emotion, he stooped,  picked up the dagger, and threw it on the bed.    \"For God's sake, sir,\" groaned Robert, \"what were you doing here in my  room with--that!\"    Dr. Cairn stood straightly upright and replied in an even voice:    \"I was here to do murder!\"    \"_Murder_!\"    \"I was under a spell--no need to name its weaver; I thought that a  poisonous thing at last lay at my mercy, and by cunning means the  primitive"]]]
