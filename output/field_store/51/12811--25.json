Poole, _The Scapegoat_.      =Molly Maguires=, stout, active young men, dressed up in women's clothes,  with faces blackened, or otherwise disguised. This secret society was  organized in 1843, to terrify the officials employed by Irish landlords  to distrain for rent, either by grippers, (_bumbailiffs_),  process-servers, keepers, or drivers (_persons who impound cattle till  the rent is paid_.[TN-17]--W. S. Trench, _Realities of Irish Life_, 82.      =Molly Mog=, an innkeeper's daughter at Oakingham, Berks. Molly Mog was  the toast of all the gay sparks in the former half of the eighteenth  century; but died a spinster at the age of 67 (1699-1766).    [Asterism] Gay has a ballad on this _Fair Maid of the Inn_. Mr. Standen,  of Arborfield, the \"enamoured swain,\" died in 1730. Molly's sister was  quite as beautiful as \"the fair maid\" herself. A portrait of Gay still  hangs in Oakingham Inn.      =Molly Wilder=, New England girl, who shelters and cares for a young  French nobleman wrecked on the Cape Cod coast. A love affair and a  clandestine marriage follow. The marriage is acknowledged when peace is  established between the French and English.--Jane G. Austin, _A Nameless  Nobleman_ (1881).      =Molmu'tius.= (See MULMUTIUS.)      =Moloch= (_ch = k_), the third in rank of the Satanic hierarchy, Satan  being first, and Be[:e]lzebub second. The word means \"king.\" The rabbins  say the idol was of brass, with the head of a calf. Moloch was the god  of the Am'monites (3 _syl._), and was worshipped in Rabba, their chief  city.        First Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood      Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears,      Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,      Their children's cries unheard, that passed thro' fire      To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite      Worshipped in Rabba.        Milton, _Paradise Lost_, i. 392, etc. (1665).      =Mo'ly= (Greek, _m[^o]lu_), mentioned in Homer's _Odyssey_. An herb with a  black root and white blossom, given by Herm[^e]s to Ulysses, to counteract  the spells of Circ[^e], (See HAEMONY.)                    ... that M[=o]'ly      That Herm[^e]s once to wise Ulysses gave.        Milton, _Comus_ (1634).                    The root was black,      Milk-white the blossom; M[^o]ly is its name      In heaven.        Homer, _Odyssey_, x. (Cowper's trans.).      =Momus's Lattice.= Momus, son of Nox, blamed Vulcan, because, in making  the human form, he had not placed a window in the breast for the  discerning of secret thoughts.        Were Momus' lattice in our breasts,      My soul might brook to open it more widely      Than theirs [i. e. _the nobles_].        Byron, _Werner_, iii., 1 (1822).      =Mon= or =Mona=, Anglesia, the residence of the Druids. Suetonius  Paul[=i]nus, who had the command of Britain in the reign of Nero (from  A.D. 59 to 62), attacked Mona, because it gave succor to the rebellious.  The frantic inhabitants ran about with fire-brands, their long hair  streaming to the wind, and the Druids invoked vengeance on the Roman  army.--See Drayton, _Polyolbion_, viii. (1612).      =Mon'aco= (_The king of_), noted because whatever he did was never right  in the opinion of his people, especially in that of Rabagas, the  demagogue: If he went out, he was \"given to pleasure;\" if he stayed at  home, he was \"given to idleness;\" if he declared war, he was \"wasteful  of the public money;\" if he did not, he was \"pusillanimous;\" if he ate,  he was \"self-indulgent;\" if he abstained, he was \"priest-ridden.\"--M.  Sardou, _Rabagas_ (1872).    _Monaco._ _Proud as a Monegasque._ A French phrase. The tradition is  that Charles Quint ennobled every one of the inhabitants of Monaco.      =Monaldini= (_Signor_), rich, _bourgeois_ citizen of Rome, who purchases,  fits up and lets to desirable tenants an old palace.--Mary Agnes  Tincker, _Signor Monaldini's Niece_ (1879).      =Monarch of Mont Blanc=, Albert Smith; so-called, because for many years  he amused a large London audience, night after night, by relating \"his  ascent of Mont Blanc\" (1816-1860).      =Monarque= (_Le Grand_), Louis XIV., of France (1638, 1643-1715).      =Monastery= (_The_), a novel by Sir W. Scott (1820). _The Abbot_ appeared  the same year. These two stories are tame and very defective in plot;  but the character of Mary queen of Scots, in _The Abbot_, is a correct  and beautiful historical portrait. The portrait of Queen Elizabeth is in  _Kenilworth_.      =Mon[c,]ada= (_Matthias de_), a merchant, stern and relentless. He arrests  his daughter the day after her confinement of a natural son.    _Zilia de Mon[c,]ada_, daughter of Matthias, and wife of General  Witherington.--Sir W. Scott, _The Surgeon's Daughter_, (time, George  II.).      =Monda'min=, maize or Indian corn (_mon-da-min_, \"the Spirit's grain\").        Sing the mysteries of mondamin,      Sing the blessing of the corn-fields.        Longfellow, _Hiawatha_, xiii. (1855).      =Mone'ses= (3 _syl._), a Greek prince, betrothed to Arpasia, whom for the  nonce he called his sister. Both were taken captive by Baj'azet. Bajazet  fell in love with Arpasia, and gave Mon[=e]s[^e]s a command in his army.  When Tamerlane overthrew Bajazet, Mon[=e]s[^e]s explained to the Tartar  king how it was that he was found in arms against him, and said his best  wish was to serve Tamerlane. Bajazet now hated the Greek, and, as  Arpasia proved obdurate, thought to frighten her into compliance by  having Mon[=e]s[^e]s bow-strung in her presence; but the sight was so  terrible that it killed her.--N. Rowe, _Tamerlane_ (1702).      =Money=, a drama by Lord E. L. B. Lytton (1840). Alfred Evelyn, a poor  scholar, was secretary and factotum of Sir John Vesey, but received no  wages. He loved Clara Douglas, a poor dependent of Lady Franklin;  proposed to her, but was not accepted, \"because both were too poor to  keep house.\" A large fortune being left to the poor scholar, he proposed  to Georgina, the daughter of Sir John Vesey; but Georgina loved Sir  Frederick Blount, and married him. Evelyn, who loved Clara, pretended to  have lost his fortune, and, being satisfied that she really loved him,  proposed a second time, and was accepted.      =Moneytrap=, husband of Araminta, but with a _tendresse_ for Clarissa, the  wife of his friend Gripe.--Sir John Vanbrugh, _The Confederacy_ (1695).      =Monflathers= (_Miss_), mistress of a boarding and day establishment, to  whom Mrs. Jarley sent little Nell, to ask her to patronize the wax-work  collection. Miss Monflathers received the child with frigid virtue, and  said to her, \"Don't you think you must be very wicked to be a wax-work  child? Don't you know it is very naughty to be a wax child when you  might have the proud consciousness of assisting, to the extent of your  infant powers, the noble manufacturers of your country?\" One of the  teachers here chimed in with \"How doth the little--;\" but Miss  Monflathers remarked, with an indignant frown, that \"the little busy  bee\" applied only to genteel children, and the \"works of labor and of  skill\" to painting and embroidery, not to vulgar children and wax-work  shows.\"[TN-18]--Charles Dickens, _The Old Curiosity Shop_, xxxi.  (1840).      =Monford=, the lover of Charlotte Whimsey. He plans various devices to  hoodwink her old father, in order to elope with the daughter.--James  Cobb, _The First Floor_ (1756-1818).      =Monime= (2 _syl._), in Racine's tragedy of _Mithridate_. This was one of  Mdlle. Rachel's great characters, first preformed[TN-19] by her in 1838.      =Monim'ia=, \"the orphan,\" sister of Chamont, and ward of Lord Acasto.  Monimia was in love with Acasto's son, Castalio, and privately married  him. Polydore (the brother of Castalio) also loved her, but his love was  dishonorable love. By treachery, Polydore obtained admission to  Monimia's chamber, and passed the bridal night with her, Monimia  supposing him to be her husband; but when the next day she discovered  the deceit, she poisoned herself; and Polydore, being apprised that  Monimia was his brother's wife, provoked a quarrel with him, ran on his  brother's sword, and died.--Otway, _The Orphan_ (1680).         More tears have been shed for the sorrows of \"Belvid[=e]ra\" and       \"Monimia,\" than for those of \"Juliet\" and \"Desdemona.\"--Sir W.       Scott, _The Drama_.    _Monimia_, in Smollett's novel of _Count Fathom_ (1754).      =Moniplies= (_Richie_), the honest, self-willed Scotch servant of Lord  Nigel Olifaunt, of Glenverloch.--Sir W. Scott, _Fortunes of Nigel_  (time, James I.).      =Monk= (_General_), introduced by Sir Walter Scott in _Woodstock_ (time,  Commonwealth.[TN-20]    _Monk_ (_The Bird Singing to a_). The monk is Felix, who listened to a  bird for a hundred years, and thought the time only an hour.--Longfellow,  _The Golden Legend_, ii. (1851).    _Monk_ (_The_), a novel, by Sir Matthew G. Lewis (1794).      =Monk Lewis.= Matthew Gregory Lewis; so called from his novel (1773-1818).      =Monk of Bury=, John Lydgate, poet, who wrote the _Siege of Troy_, the  _Story of Thebes_, and the _Fall of Princes_ (1375-1460).        Nothynge I am experte in poetry,      As the monke of Bury, floure of eloquence.        Stephen Hawes, _The Passe-Tyme[TN-21] of Plesure_ (1515).      =Monk of Westminister=, Richard, of Cirencester, the chronicler  (fourteenth century).    This chronicle, _On the Ancient State of Britain_, was first brought to  light in 1747, by Dr. Charles Julius Bertram, professor of English at  Copenhagen; but the original being no better known than that of Thomas  Rowley's poems, published by Chatterton, grave suspicions exist that Dr.  Bertram was himself the author of the chronicles.      =Monks= (_The Father of_), Ethelwold, of Winchester (*-984).    _Monks_, _alias_ Edward Leeford, a violent man, subject to fits. Edward  Leeford, though half-brother to Oliver Twist, was in collusion with Bill  Sykes, to ruin him.

She learned early, from  my mother's example, that hands and feet and brains were made for  labor. She learned to bow to the yoke, to lift burdens, to do more for  others than she could ever hope to have done for her in turn. She  learned to see sugar plums lie around without asking for her share.  When she was only fit to nurse her dolls, she learned how to comfort a  weary heart.    And all this while I sat warm and watched over at home, untouched by  any discipline save such as I directly incurred by my own sins. I  differed from Fetchke a little in age, considerably in health, and  enormously in luck. It was my good luck, in the first place, to be  born after her, instead of before; in the second place, to inherit,  from the family stock, that particular assortment of gifts which was  sure to mark me for special attentions, exemptions, and privileges;  and as fortune always smiles on good fortune, it has ever been my  luck, in the third place, to find something good in my idle  hand--whether a sunbeam, or a loving heart, or a congenial  task--whenever, on turning a corner, I put out my hand to see what my  new world was like; while my sister, dear, devoted creature, had her  hands so full of work that the sunbeam slipped, and the loving comrade  passed out of hearing before she could straighten from her task, and  all she had of the better world was a scented zephyr fanned in her  face by the irresistible closing of a door.    Perhaps Esau has been too severely blamed for selling his birthright  for a mess of pottage. The lot of the firstborn is not necessarily to  be envied. The firstborn of a well-to-do patriarch, like Isaac, or of  a Rothschild of to-day, inherits, with his father's flocks and slaves  and coffers, a troop of cares and responsibilities; unless he be a  man without a sense of duty, in which case we are not supposed to envy  him. The firstborn of an indigent father inherits a double measure of  the disadvantages of poverty,--a joyless childhood, a guideless youth,  and perhaps a mateless manhood, his own life being drained to feed the  young of his father's begetting. If we cannot do away with poverty  entirely, we ought at least to abolish the institution of  primogeniture. Nature invented the individual, and promised him, as a  reward for lusty being, comfort and immortality. Comes man with his  patented brains and copyrighted notions, and levies a tax on the  individual, in the form of enforced cooeperation, for the maintenance  of his pet institution, the family. Our comfort, in the grip of this  tyranny, must lie in the hope that man, who is no bastard child of  Mother Nature, may be approaching a more perfect resemblance to her  majestic features; that his fitful development will culminate in a  spiritual constitution capable of absolute justice.           *       *       *       *       *    I think I was telling how I stayed at home in the winter, while my  sister helped or hindered my mother in her store-keeping. The days  drew themselves out too long sometimes, so that I sat at the window  thinking what should happen next. No dolls, no books, no games, and at  times no companions. My grandmother taught me knitting, but I never  got to the heel of my stocking, because if I discovered a dropped  stitch I insisted on unravelling all my work till I picked it up; and  grandmother, instead of encouraging me in my love for perfection, lost  patience and took away my knitting needles. I still maintain that she  was in the wrong, but I have forgiven her, since I have worn many  pairs of stockings with dropped stitches, and been grateful for them.  And speaking of such everyday things reminds me of my friends, among  whom also I find an impressive number with a stitch dropped somewhere  in the pattern of their souls. I love these friends so dearly that I  begin to think I am at last shedding my intolerance; for I remember  the day when I could not love less than perfection. I and my imperfect  friends together aspire to cast our blemishes, and I am happier so.    There was not much to see from my window, yet adventures beckoned to  me from the empty street. Sometimes the adventure was real, and I went  out to act in it, instead of dreaming on my stool. Once, I remember,  it was early spring, and the winter's ice, just chopped up by the  street cleaners, lay muddy and ragged and high in the streets from  curb to curb. So it must lie till there was time to cart it to the  Dvina, which had all it could do at this season to carry tons, and  heavy tons, of ice and snow and every sort of city rubbish,  accumulated during the long closed months. Polotzk had no underground  communication with the sea, save such as water naturally makes for  itself. The poor old Dvina was hard-worked, serving both as  drinking-fountain and sewer, as a bridge in winter, a highway in  summer, and a playground at all times. So it served us right if we had  to wait weeks and weeks in thawing time for our streets to be cleared;  and we deserved all the sprains and bruises we suffered from  clambering over the broken ice in the streets while going about our  business.    Leah the Short, little and straight and neat, with a basket on one arm  and a bundle under the other, stood hesitating on the edge of the curb  opposite my window. Her poor old face, framed in its calico kerchief,  had a wrinkle of anxiety in it. The tumbled ice heap in the street  looked to her like an impassable barrier. Tiny as she was, and loaded,  she had reason to hesitate. Perhaps she had eggs in her basket,--I  thought of that as I looked at her across the street; and I thought of  my old ambition to measure myself, shoulder to shoulder, with Leah,  reputedly short. I was small myself, and was constantly reminded of it  by a variety of nicknames, lovingly or vengefully invented by my  friends and enemies. I was called Mouse and Crumb and Poppy Seed.  Should I live to be called, in my old age, Mashke the Short? I longed  to measure my stature by Leah's, and here was my chance.    I ran out into the street, my grandmother scolding me for going  without a shawl, and I calling back to her to be sure and watch me. I  skipped over the ice blocks like a goat, and offered my assistance to  Leah the Short. With admirable skill and solicitude I guided her timid  steps across the street, at the same time winking to my grandmother at  the window, and pointing to my shoulder close to Leah's. Once on the  safe sidewalk, the tiny woman thanked me and blessed me and praised me  for a thoughtful child; and I watched her toddle away without the  least stir of shame at my hypocrisy. She had convinced me that I was a  good little girl, and I had convinced myself that I was not so very  short. My chin was almost on a level with Leah's shoulder, and I had  years ahead in which to elevate it. Grandma at the window was witness,  and I was entirely happy. If I caught cold from going bareheaded, so  much the better; mother would give me rock candy for my cough.    For the long winter evenings there was plenty of quiet occupation. I  liked to sit with the women at the long bare table picking feathers  for new featherbeds. It was pleasant to poke my hand into the  soft-heaped mass and set it all in motion. I pretended that I could  pick out the feathers of particular hens, formerly my pets. I  reflected that they had fed me with eggs and broth, and now were going  to make my bed so soft; while I had done nothing for them but throw  them a handful of oats now and then, or chase them about, or spoil  their nests. I was not ashamed of my part; I knew that if I were a hen  I should do as a hen does. I just liked to think about things in my  idle way.    Itke, the housemaid, was always the one to break in upon my  reflections. She was sure to have a fit of sneezing just when the heap  on the table was highest, sending clouds of feathers into the air,  like a homemade snowstorm. After that the evening was finished by our  picking the feathers from each other's hair.    Sometimes we played cards or checkers, munching frost-bitten apples  between moves. Sometimes the women sewed, and we children wound yarn  or worsted for grandmother's knitting. If somebody had a story to tell  while the rest worked, the evening passed with a pleasant sense of  semi-idleness for all.    On a Saturday night, the Sabbath being just departed, ghost stories  were particularly in favor. After two or three of the creepy legends  we began to move closer together under the lamp. At the end of an hour  or so we started and screamed if a spool fell, or a window rattled. At  bedtime nobody was willing to make the round of doors and windows, and  we were afraid to bring a candle into a dark room.    I was just as much afraid as anybody. I am afraid now to be alone in  the house at night. I certainly was afraid that Saturday night when  somebody, in bravado, suggested fresh-baked buns, as a charm to dispel  the ghosts. The baker who lived next door always baked on Saturday  night. Who would go and fetch the buns? Nobody dared to venture  outdoors. It had snowed all evening; the frosted windows prevented a  preliminary survey of the silent night. _Brr-rr!_ Nobody would take  the dare.    Nobody but me. Oh, how the creeps ran up and down my back! and oh! how  I loved to distinguish myself! I let them bundle me up till I was  nearly smothered. I paused with my mittened hand on the latch. I  shivered, though I could have sat the night out with a Polar bear  without another shawl. I opened the door, and then turned back, to  make a speech.    \"I am not afraid,\" I said, in the noble accents of courage. \"I am not  afraid to go. God goes with me.\"    Pride goeth before a fall. On the step outside I slid down into a  drift, just on the eve of triumph. They picked me up; they brought me  in. They found all of me inside my wrappings. They gave me a piece of  sugar and sent me to bed. And I "]]]
