[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#19)"],[1," shall see that throughout the text Anu and Enlil are the ultimate rulers  of both gods and men.    The narrative then introduces the human hero of the Deluge story:         At that time Ziusudu, the king, . . . priest of the god (. . .),         Made a very great . . ., (. . .).         In humility he prostrates himself, in reverence (. . .),         Daily he stands in attendance (. . .).         A dream,(1) such as had not been before, comes forth(2) . . .            (. . .),         By the Name of Heaven and Earth he conjures (. . .).         (1) The word may also be rendered \"dreams\".         (2) For this rendering of the verb _e-de_, for which Dr.       Poebel does not hazard a translation, see Rawlinson,       _W.A.I._, IV, pl. 26, l. 24 f.(a), _nu-e-de_ = Sem. _la us-       su-u_ (Pres.); and cf. Bruennow, _Classified List_, p. 327.       An alternative rendering \"is created\" is also possible, and       would give equally good sense; cf. _nu-e-de_ = Sem. _la su-       pu-u_, _W.A.I._, IV, pl. 2, l. 5 (a), and Bruennow, op. cit.,       p. 328.    The name of the hero, Ziusudu, is the fuller Sumerian equivalent of  Ut-napishtim (or Uta-napishtim), the abbreviated Semitic form which we  find in the Gilgamesh Epic. For not only are the first two elements of  the Sumerian name identical with those of the Semitic Ut-napishtim,  but the names themselves are equated in a later Babylonian syllabary or  explanatory list of words.(1) We there find \"Ut-napishte\" given as the  equivalent of the Sumerian \"Zisuda\", evidently an abbreviated form of  the name Ziusudu;(2) and it is significant that the names occur in  the syllabary between those of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, evidently in  consequence of the association of the Deluge story by the Babylonians  with their national epic of Gilgamesh. The name Ziusudu may be rendered  \"He who lengthened the day of life\" or \"He who made life long of  days\",(3) which in the Semitic form is abbreviated by the omission of  the verb. The reference is probably to the immortality bestowed upon  Ziusudu at the close of the story, and not to the prolongation of  mankind's existence in which he was instrumental. It is scarcely  necessary to add that the name has no linguistic connexion with the  Hebrew name Noah, to which it also presents no parallel in meaning.         (1) Cf. _Cun. Texts in the Brit. Mus._, Pt. XVIII, pl. 30,       l. 9 (a).         (2) The name in the Sumerian Version is read by Dr. Poebel       as Ziugiddu, but there is much in favour of Prof. Zimmern's       suggestion, based on the form Zisuda, that the third       syllable of the name should be read as _su_. On a fragment       of another Nippur text, No. 4611, Dr. Langdon reads the name       as _Zi-u-sud-du_ (cf. Univ. of Penns. Mus. Publ., Bab. Sec.,       Vol. X, No. 1, p. 90, pl. iv a); the presence of the       phonetic complement _du_ may be cited in favour of this       reading, but it does not appear to be supported by the       photographic reproductions of the name in the Sumerian       Deluge Version given by Dr. Poebel (_Hist. and Gramm.       Texts_, pl. lxxxviii f.). It may be added that, on either       alternative, the meaning of the name is the same.         (3) The meaning of the Sumerian element _u_ in the name,       rendered as _utu_ in the Semitic form, is rather obscure,       and Dr. Poebel left it unexplained. It is very probable, as       suggested by Dr. Langdon (cf. _Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch._,       XXXVI, 1914, p. 190), that we should connect it with the       Semitic _uddu_; in that case, in place of \"breath\", the       rending he suggests, I should be inclined to render it here       as \"day\", for _uddu_ as the meaning \"dawn\" and the sign UD       is employed both for _urru_, \"day-light\", and _umu_, \"day\".    It is an interesting fact that Ziusudu should be described simply as  \"the king\", without any indication of the city or area he ruled; and  in three of the five other passages in the text in which his name is  mentioned it is followed by the same title without qualification. In  most cases Berossus tells us the cities from which his Antediluvian  rulers came; and if the end of the line had been preserved it might have  been possible to determine definitely Ziusudu's city, and incidentally  the scene of the Deluge in the Sumerian Version, by the name of the  deity in whose service he acted as priest. We have already noted some  grounds for believing that his city may have been Shuruppak, as in the  Babylonian Version; and if that were so, the divine name reads as \"the  God of Shurrupak\" should probably be restored at the end of the line.(1)         (1) The remains that are preserved of the determinative,       which is not combined with the sign EN, proves that Enki's       name is not to be restored. Hence Ziusudu was not priest of       Enki, and his city was probably not Eridu, the seat of his       divine friend and counsellor, and the first of the       Antediluvian cities. Sufficient reason for Enki's       intervention on Ziusudu's behalf is furnished by the fact       that, as God of the Deep, he was concerned in the proposed       method of man's destruction. His rivalry of Enlil, the God       of the Earth, is implied in the Babylonian Version (cf.       Gilg. Epic. XI, ll. 39-42), and in the Sumerian Version this       would naturally extend to Anu, the God of Heaven.    The employment of the royal title by itself accords with the tradition  from Berossus that before the Deluge, as in later periods, the land was  governed by a succession of supreme rulers, and that the hero of the  Deluge was the last of them. In the Gilgamesh Epic, on the other  hand, Ut-napishtim is given no royal nor any other title. He is merely  referred to as a \"man of Shuruppak, son of Ubar-Tutu\", and he appears in  the guise of an ancient hero or patriarch not invested with royal  power. On this point Berossus evidently preserves the original Sumerian  traditions, while the Hebrew Versions resemble the Semitic-Babylonian  narrative. The Sumerian conception of a series of supreme Antediluvian  rulers is of course merely a reflection from the historical period,  when the hegemony in Babylonia was contested among the city-states. The  growth of the tradition may have been encouraged by the early use of  _lugal_, \"king\", which, though always a term of secular character, was  not very sharply distinguished from that of _patesi_ and other religious  titles, until, in accordance with political development, it was required  to connote a wider dominion. In Sumer, at the time of the composition  of our text, Ziusudu was still only one in a long line of Babylonian  rulers, mainly historical but gradually receding into the realms of  legend and myth. At the time of the later Semites there had been more  than one complete break in the tradition and the historical setting  of the old story had become dim. The fact that Hebrew tradition should  range itself in this matter with Babylon rather than with Sumer is  important as a clue in tracing the literary history of our texts.    The rest of the column may be taken as descriptive of Ziusudu's  activities. One line records his making of some very great object or  the erection of a huge building;(1) and since the following lines are  concerned solely with religious activities, the reference is possibly to  a temple or some other structure of a sacred character. Its foundation  may have been recorded as striking evidence of his devotion to his god;  or, since the verb in this sentence depends on the words \"at that time\"  in the preceding line, we may perhaps regard his action as directly  connected with the revelation to be made to him. His personal piety  is then described: daily he occupied himself in his god's service,  prostrating himself in humility and constant in his attendance at the  shrine. A dream (or possibly dreams), \"such as had not been before\",  appears to him and he seems to be further described as conjuring \"by  the Name of Heaven and Earth\"; but as the ends of all these lines are  broken, the exact connexion of the phrases is not quite certain.    (1) The element _gur-gur_, \"very large\" or \"huge\", which occurs in the  name of this great object or building, _an- sag-gur-gur_, is employed  later in the term for the \"huge boat\", _(gish)ma-gur-gur_, in which  Ziusudu rode out the storm. There was, of course, even at this early  period a natural tendency to picture on a superhuman scale the lives and  deeds of remote predecessors, a tendency which increased in later times  and led, as we shall see, to the elaboration of extravagant detail.    It is difficult not to associate the reference to a dream, or possibly  to dream-divination, with the warning in which Enki reveals the purpose  of the gods. For the later versions prepare us for a reference to  a dream. If we take the line as describing Ziusudu's practice of  dream-divination in general, \"such as had not been before\", he may have  been represented as the first diviner of dreams, as Enmeduranki was held  to be the first practitioner of divination in general. But it seems to  me more probable that the reference is to a particular dream, by means  of which he obtained knowledge of the gods' intentions. On the rendering  of this passage depends our interpretation of the whole of the Fourth  Column, where the point will be further discussed. Meanwhile it may be  noted that the conjuring \"by the Name of Heaven and Earth\", which we may  assume is ascribed to Ziusudu, gains in significance if we may regard  the setting of the myth as a magical incantation, an inference in  support of which we shall note further evidence. For we are furnished  at once with the grounds for its magical employment. If Ziusudu, through  conjuring by the Name of Heaven and earth, could profit by the warning  sent him and so escape the impending fate of mankind, the application of  such a myth to the special needs of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII. (#19)"],[1,"g's secretary, was afterwards thought to be  treading too close on the Cardinal's heels. He set out in October, and  arrived in Zurich just in time to prevent the Swiss from coming    (p. 090)  to terms with Francis. Before winter had ended the plans for invasion  were settled. Maximilian came down with the snows from the mountains  in March; on the 23rd he crossed the Adda;[214] on the 25th he was  within nine miles of Milan, and almost in sight of the army of France.  On the 26th he turned and fled without striking a blow. Back he went  over the Adda, over the Oglio, up into Tyrol, leaving the French and  Venetians in secure possession of Northern Italy. A year later they  had recovered for Venice the last of the places of which it had been  robbed by the League of Cambrai.                       [Footnote 214: _L. and P._, ii., 1697, 1699, 1721,                     1729, 1736, 1754, 1831, 2011, 2034, 2114.]    Maximilian retreated, said Pace, voluntarily and shamefully, and was  now so degraded that it signified little whether he was a friend or an  enemy.[215] The cause of his ignominious flight still remains a  mystery; countless excuses were made by Maximilian and his friends. He  had heard that France and England had come to terms; 6,000 of the  Swiss infantry deserted to the French on the eve of the battle.  Ladislaus of Hungary had died, leaving him guardian of his son, and he  must go to arrange matters there. He had no money to pay his troops.  The last has an appearance of verisimilitude. Money was at the bottom  of all his difficulties, and drove him to the most ignominious shifts.  He had served as a private in Henry's army for 100 crowns a day. His  councillors robbed him; on one occasion he had not money to pay for  his dinner;[216] on another he sent down to Pace, who was ill in bed,  and extorted a loan by force. He had apparently seized 30,000      (p. 091)  crowns of Henry's pay for the Swiss;[217] the Fuggers, Welzers and  Frescobaldi, were also accused of failing to keep their engagements,  and only the first month's pay had been received by the Swiss when  they reached Milan. On the Emperor's retreat the wretched Pace was  seized by the Swiss and kept in prison as security for the remainder.[218]  His task had been rendered all the more difficult by the folly of  Wingfield, ambassador at Maximilian's Court, who, said Pace, \"took the  Emperor for a god and believed that all his deeds and thoughts  proceeded _ex Spiritu Sancto_\".[219] There was no love lost between  them; the lively Pace nicknamed his colleague \"Summer shall be green,\"  in illusion perhaps to Wingfield's unending platitudes, or to his  limitless belief in the Emperor's integrity and wisdom.[220] Wingfield  opened Pace's letters and discovered the gibe, which he parried by  avowing that he had never known the time when summer was not  green.[221] On another occasion he forged Pace's signature, with a  view of obtaining funds for Maximilian;[222] and he had the hardihood  to protest against Pace's appointment as Henry's secretary. At last  his conduct brought down a stinging rebuke from Henry;[223] but the  King's long-suffering was not yet exhausted, and Wingfield continued  as ambassador to the Emperors Court.

It was their first attempt to intervene in a  sphere of action so distant from English shores and so remote      (p. 092)  from English interests as the affairs of Italian States. Complaints in  England were loud against the waste of money; the sagacious Tunstall  wrote that he did not see why Henry should bind himself to maintain  other men's causes.[224] All the grandees, wrote Giustinian, were  opposed to Wolsey's policy, and its adoption was followed by what  Giustinian called a change of ministry in England.[225] Warham  relinquished the burdens of the Chancellorship which he had long  unwillingly borne; Fox sought to atone for twenty-eight years' neglect  of his diocese by spending in it the rest of his days.[226] Wolsey  succeeded Warham as Chancellor, and Ruthal, who \"sang treble to  Wolsey's bass,\"[227] became Lord Privy Seal in place of Fox. Suffolk  was out of favour, and the neglect of his and Fox's advice was,  according to the Venetian, resented by the people, who murmured  against the taxes which Wolsey's intervention in foreign affairs  involved.                       [Footnote 224: _L. and P._, ii., 2270.]                       [Footnote 225: _Ibid._, ii., 1814, 2487, 2500.]                       [Footnote 226: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 750, 798, 801; _L.                     and P._, ii., 2183.]                       [Footnote 227: _L. and P._, ii., 2205.]    But Wolsey still hoped that bribes would keep Maximilian faithful to  England and induce him to counteract the French influences with which  his grandson Charles was surrounded. Ferdinand had died in January,  1516,[228] having, said the English envoy at his Court, wilfully  shortened his life by hunting and hawking in all weathers, and following  the advice of his falconers rather than that of his physicians.  Charles thus succeeded to Castile, Aragon and Naples;[229] but     (p. 093)  Naples was seriously threatened by the failure of Maximilian's  expedition and the omnipotence of Francis in Italy. \"The Pope is  French,\" wrote an English diplomatist, \"and everything from Rome to  Calais.\"[230] To save Naples, Charles, in July, 1516, entered into the  humiliating Treaty of Noyon with France.[231] He bound himself to  marry Francis's infant daughter, Charlotte, to do justice to Jean  d'Albret in the matter of Navarre, and to surrender Naples, Navarre,  and Artois, if he failed to keep his engagement. Such a treaty was not  likely to stand; but, for the time, it was a great feather in  Francis's cap, and a further step towards the isolation of England. It  was the work of Charles's Gallicised ministry, and Maximilian  professed the utmost disgust at their doings. He was eager to come  down to the Netherlands with a view to breaking the Treaty of Noyon  and removing his grandson's advisers, but of course he must have money  from England to pay his expenses. The money accordingly came from the  apparently bottomless English purse;[232] and in January, 1517, the  Emperor marched down to the Netherlands, breathing, in his despatches  to Henry, threatenings and slaughter against Charles's misleaders. His  descent on Flanders eclipsed his march on Milan. \"Mon fils,\" he said  to Charles, \"vous allez tromper les Francais, et moi, je vais tromper  les Anglais.\"[233] So far from breaking the Treaty of Noyon, he    (p. 094)  joined it himself, and at Brussels solemnly swore to observe its  provisions. He probably thought he had touched the bottom of Henry's  purse, and that it was time to dip into Francis's. Seventy-five  thousand crowns was his price for betraying Henry.[234]                       [Footnote 228: On 23rd Jan. (_L. and P._, ii.,                     1541, 1610). Brewer in his introduction to vol. ii.                     of the _L. and P._ says \"in February\".]                       [Footnote 229: His mother Juana was rightfully                     Queen, but she was regarded as mad; she thought her                     husband, the Archduke Philip, might come to life                     again, and carried him about in a coffin with her                     wherever she went (_Ven. Cal._, ii., 564).]                       [Footnote 230: _L. and P._, ii., 2930.]                       [Footnote 231: _L. and P._, ii., 2303, 2327, 2387;                     _Ven.

Charles would not wait to marry Francis's daughter, and  then the breach would come.[237] Henry and Wolsey had the good sense  to act on this sound advice. Maximilian, Francis and Charles formed at  Cambrai a fresh league for the partition of Italy,[238] but they were  soon at enmity and too much involved with their own affairs to think  of the conquest of others. Disaffection was rife in Spain, where a  party wished Ferdinand, Charles's brother, to be King.[239] If Charles  was to retain his Spanish kingdoms, he must visit them at once. He  could not go unless England provided the means. His request for    (p. 095)  a loan was graciously accorded and his ambassadors were treated with  magnificent courtesy.[240] \"One day,\" says Chieregati,[241] the"]]]
