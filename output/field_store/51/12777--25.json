When Col. Lloyd's slaves met those of Jacob Jepson,  they{92} seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Col.  Lloyd's slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson's  slaves that he was the smartest, man of the two. Col. Lloyd's slaves  would boost his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson; Mr. Jepson's  slaves would boast his ability to whip Col. Lloyd. These quarrels would  almost always end in a fight between the parties; those that beat were  supposed to have gained the point at issue. They seemed to think that  the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves. To be a  SLAVE, was thought to be bad enough; but to be a _poor man's_ slave, was  deemed a disgrace, indeed.

LLOYD--THE MURDER  UNPUNISHED--ANOTHER DREADFUL MURDER NARRATED--NO LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION  OF SLAVES CAN BE ENFORCED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.      As I have already intimated elsewhere, the slaves on Col. Lloyd's  plantation, whose hard lot, under Mr. Sevier, the reader has already  noticed and deplored, were not permitted to enjoy the comparatively  moderate rule of Mr. Hopkins. The latter was succeeded by a very  different man. The name of the new overseer was Austin Gore. Upon this  individual I would fix particular attention; for under his rule there  was more suffering from violence and bloodshed than had--according to  the older slaves ever been experienced before on this plantation. I  confess, I hardly know how to bring this man fitly before the reader.  He was, it is true, an overseer, and possessed, to a large extent,  the peculiar characteristics of his class; yet, to call him merely an  overseer, would not give the reader a fair notion of the man. I speak  of overseers as a class. They are such. They are as distinct from the  slaveholding gentry of the south, as are the fishwomen of Paris, and  the coal-heavers of London, distinct from other members of society. They  constitute a separate fraternity at the south, not less marked than is  the fraternity of Park Lane bullies in New York. They have been arranged  and classified{94} by that great law of attraction, which determines the  spheres and affinities of men; which ordains, that men, whose malign  and brutal propensities predominate over their moral and intellectual  endowments, shall, naturally, fall into those employments which  promise the largest gratification to those predominating instincts  or propensities. The office of overseer takes this raw material of  vulgarity and brutality, and stamps it as a distinct class of southern  society. But, in this class, as in all other classes, there are  characters of marked individuality, even while they bear a general  resemblance to the mass. Mr. Gore was one of those, to whom a general  characterization would do no manner of justice. He was an overseer; but  he was something more. With the malign and tyrannical qualities of  an overseer, he combined something of the lawful master. He had the  artfulness and the mean ambition of his class; but he was wholly free  from the disgusting swagger and noisy bravado of his fraternity. There  was an easy air of independence about him; a calm self-possession, and a  sternness of glance, which might well daunt hearts less timid than those  of poor slaves, accustomed from childhood and through life to cower  before a driver's lash. The home plantation of Col. Lloyd afforded an  ample field for the exercise of the qualifications for overseership,  which he possessed in such an eminent degree.    Mr. Gore was one of those overseers, who could torture the slightest  word or look into impudence; he had the nerve, not only to resent,  but to punish, promptly and severely. He never allowed himself to be  answered back, by a slave. In this, he was as lordly and as imperious as  Col. Edward Lloyd, himself; acting always up to the maxim, practically  maintained by slaveholders, that it is better that a dozen slaves suffer  under the lash, without fault, than that the master or the overseer  should _seem_ to have been wrong in the presence of the slave.  _Everything must be absolute here_. Guilty or not guilty, it is enough  to be accused, to be sure of a flogging. The very presence of this  man Gore was{95} painful, and I shunned him as I would have shunned a  rattlesnake. His piercing, black eyes, and sharp, shrill voice, ever  awakened sensations of terror among the slaves. For so young a man (I  describe him as he was, twenty-five or thirty years ago) Mr. Gore was  singularly reserved and grave in the presence of slaves. He indulged  in no jokes, said no funny things, and kept his own counsels. Other  overseers, how brutal soever they might be, were, at times, inclined to  gain favor with the slaves, by indulging a little pleasantry; but Gore  was never known to be guilty of any such weakness. He was always  the cold, distant, unapproachable _overseer_ of Col. Edward Lloyd's  plantation, and needed no higher pleasure than was involved in a  faithful discharge of the duties of his office. When he whipped, he  seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. What  Hopkins did reluctantly, Gore did with alacrity. There was a stern will,  an iron-like reality, about this Gore, which would have easily made him  the chief of a band of pirates, had his environments been favorable to  such a course of life. All the coolness, savage barbarity and freedom  from moral restraint, which are necessary in the character of a  pirate-chief, centered, I think, in this man Gore. Among many other  deeds of shocking cruelty which he perpetrated, while I was at Mr.  Lloyd's, was the murder of a young colored man, named Denby. He was  sometimes called Bill Denby, or Demby; (I write from sound, and the  sounds on Lloyd's plantation are not very certain.) I knew him well. He  was a powerful young man, full of animal spirits, and, so far as I know,  he was among the most valuable of Col. Lloyd's slaves. In something--I  know not what--he offended this Mr. Austin Gore, and, in accordance with  the custom of the latter, he under took to flog him. He gave Denby but  few stripes; the latter broke away from him and plunged into the creek,  and, standing there to the depth of his neck in water, he refused to  come out at the order of the overseer; whereupon, for this refusal,  _Gore shot him dead!_ It is said that Gore gave Denby three calls,  telling him that{96} if he did not obey the last call, he would shoot  him. When the third call was given, Denby stood his ground firmly; and  this raised the question, in the minds of the by-standing slaves--\"Will  he dare to shoot?\" Mr. Gore, without further parley, and without making  any further effort to induce Denby to come out of the water, raised his  gun deliberately to his face, took deadly aim at his standing victim,  and, in an instant, poor Denby was numbered with the dead. His mangled  body sank out of sight, and only his warm, red blood marked the place  where he had stood.    This devilish outrage, this fiendish murder, produced, as it was well  calculated to do, a tremendous sensation. A thrill of horror flashed  through every soul on the plantation, if I may except the guilty wretch  who had committed the hell-black deed. While the slaves generally were  panic-struck, and howling with alarm, the murderer himself was calm  and collected, and appeared as though nothing unusual had happened. The  atrocity roused my old master, and he spoke out, in reprobation of it;  but the whole thing proved to be less than a nine days' wonder. Both  Col. Lloyd and my old master arraigned Gore for his cruelty in the  matter, but this amounted to nothing. His reply, or explanation--as  I remember to have heard it at the time was, that the extraordinary  expedient was demanded by necessity; that Denby had become unmanageable;  that he had set a dangerous example to the other slaves; and that,  without some such prompt measure as that to which he had resorted, were  adopted, there would be an end to all rule and order on the plantation.  That very convenient covert for all manner of cruelty and outrage  that cowardly alarm-cry, that the slaves would _\"take the place,\"_ was  pleaded, in extenuation of this revolting crime, just as it had been  cited in defense of a thousand similar ones. He argued, that if one  slave refused to be corrected, and was allowed to escape with his life,  when he had been told that he should lose it if he persisted in his  course, the other slaves would soon copy his example; the result of  which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of  the{97} whites. I have every reason to believe that Mr. Gore's defense,  or explanation, was deemed satisfactory--at least to Col. Lloyd. He was  continued in his office on the plantation. His fame as an overseer  went abroad, and his horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial  investigation. The murder was committed in the presence of slaves, and  they, of course, could neither institute a suit, nor testify against  the murderer. His bare word would go further in a court of law, than the  united testimony of ten thousand black witnesses.    All that Mr. Gore had to do, was to make his peace with Col. Lloyd. This  done, and the guilty perpetrator of one of the most foul murders goes  unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives.  Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael's, Talbot county, when I left Maryland; if  he is still alive he probably yet resides there; and I have no reason  to doubt that he is now as highly esteemed, and as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#19)"],[1," forced to the  conclusion that he had seen the last of his great mount of the  preceding day.    And so he set his face toward A-lur, pinning his faith upon his  knowledge of the Ho-don tongue, his great strength and his native wit.    Refreshed by food and rest, the journey toward A-lur, made in the cool  of the morning along the bank of the joyous river, he found delightful  in the extreme. Differentiating him from his fellows of the savage  jungle were many characteristics other than those physical and mental.  Not the least of these were in a measure spiritual, and one that had  doubtless been as strong as another in influencing Tarzan's love of the  jungle had been his appreciation of the beauties of nature. The apes  cared more for a grubworm in a rotten log than for all the majestic  grandeur of the forest giants waving above them. The only beauties that  Numa acknowledged were those of his own person as he paraded them  before the admiring eyes of his mate, but in all the manifestations of  the creative power of nature of which Tarzan was cognizant he  appreciated the beauties.    As Tarzan neared the city his interest became centered upon the  architecture of the outlying buildings which were hewn from the  chalklike limestone of what had once been a group of low hills, similar  to the many grass-covered hillocks that dotted the valley in every  direction. Ta-den's explanation of the Ho-don methods of house  construction accounted for the ofttimes remarkable shapes and  proportions of the buildings which, during the ages that must have been  required for their construction, had been hewn from the limestone  hills, the exteriors chiseled to such architectural forms as appealed  to the eyes of the builders while at the same time following roughly  the original outlines of the hills in an evident desire to economize  both labor and space. The excavation of the apartments within had been  similarly governed by necessity.    As he came nearer Tarzan saw that the waste material from these  building operations had been utilized in the construction of outer  walls about each building or group of buildings resulting from a single  hillock, and later he was to learn that it had also been used for the  filling of inequalities between the hills and the forming of paved  streets throughout the city, the result, possibly, more of the adoption  of an easy method of disposing of the quantities of broken limestone  than by any real necessity for pavements.    There were people moving about within the city and upon the narrow  ledges and terraces that broke the lines of the buildings and which  seemed to be a peculiarity of Ho-don architecture, a concession, no  doubt, to some inherent instinct that might be traced back to their  early cliff-dwelling progenitors.    Tarzan was not surprised that at a short distance he aroused no  suspicion or curiosity in the minds of those who saw him, since, until  closer scrutiny was possible, there was little to distinguish him from  a native either in his general conformation or his color. He had, of  course, formulated a plan of action and, having decided, he did not  hesitate in the carrying out his plan.    With the same assurance that you might venture upon the main street of  a neighboring city Tarzan strode into the Ho-don city of A-lur. The  first person to detect his spuriousness was a little child playing in  the arched gateway of one of the walled buildings. \"No tail! no tail!\"  it shouted, throwing a stone at him, and then it suddenly grew dumb and  its eyes wide as it sensed that this creature was something other than  a mere Ho-don warrior who had lost his tail. With a gasp the child  turned and fled screaming into the courtyard of its home.    Tarzan continued on his way, fully realizing that the moment was  imminent when the fate of his plan would be decided. Nor had he long to  wait since at the next turning of the winding street he came face to  face with a Ho-don warrior. He saw the sudden surprise in the latter's  eyes, followed instantly by one of suspicion, but before the fellow  could speak Tarzan addressed him.    \"I am a stranger from another land,\" he said; \"I would speak with  Ko-tan, your king.\"    The fellow stepped back, laying his hand upon his knife. \"There are no  strangers that come to the gates of A-lur,\" he said, \"other than as  enemies or slaves.\"    \"I come neither as a slave nor an enemy,\" replied Tarzan. \"I come  directly from Jad-ben-Otho. Look!\" and he held out his hands that the  Ho-don might see how greatly they differed from his own, and then  wheeled about that the other might see that he was tailless, for it was  upon this fact that his plan had been based, due to his recollection of  the quarrel between Ta-den and Om-at, in which the Waz-don had claimed  that Jad-ben-Otho had a long tail while the Ho-don had been equally  willing to fight for his faith in the taillessness of his god.    The warrior's eyes widened and an expression of awe crept into them,  though it was still tinged with suspicion. \"Jad-ben-Otho!\" he murmured,  and then, \"It is true that you are neither Ho-don nor Waz-don, and it  is also true that Jad-ben-Otho has no tail.  Come,\" he said, \"I will  take you to Ko-tan, for this is a matter in which no common warrior may  interfere. Follow me,\" and still clutching the handle of his knife and  keeping a wary side glance upon the ape-man he led the way through  A-lur.    The city covered a large area. Sometimes there was a considerable  distance between groups of buildings, and again they were quite close  together. There were numerous imposing groups, evidently hewn from the  larger hills, often rising to a height of a hundred feet or more. As  they advanced they met numerous warriors and women, all of whom showed  great curiosity in the stranger, but there was no attempt to menace him  when it was found that he was being conducted to the palace of the king.    They came at last to a great pile that sprawled over a considerable  area, its western front facing upon a large blue lake and evidently  hewn from what had once been a natural cliff.  This group of buildings  was surrounded by a wall of considerably greater height than any that  Tarzan had before seen. His guide led him to a gateway before which  waited a dozen or more warriors who had risen to their feet and formed  a barrier across the entrance-way as Tarzan and his party appeared  around the corner of the palace wall, for by this time he had  accumulated such a following of the curious as presented to the guards  the appearance of a formidable mob.    The guide's story told, Tarzan was conducted into the courtyard where  he was held while one of the warriors entered the palace, evidently  with the intention of notifying Ko-tan. Fifteen minutes later a large  warrior appeared, followed by several others, all of whom examined  Tarzan with every sign of curiosity as they approached.    The leader of the party halted before the ape-man. \"Who are you?\" he  asked, \"and what do you want of Ko-tan, the king?\"    \"I am a friend,\" replied the ape-man, \"and I have come from the country  of Jad-ben-Otho to visit Ko-tan of Pal-ul-don.\"    The warrior and his followers seemed impressed. Tarzan could see the  latter whispering among themselves.    \"How come you here,\" asked the spokesman, \"and what do you want of  Ko-tan?\"    Tarzan drew himself to his full height. \"Enough!\" he cried.  \"Must the  messenger of Jad-ben-Otho be subjected to the treatment that might be  accorded to a wandering Waz-don? Take me to the king at once lest the  wrath of Jad-ben-Otho fall upon you.\"    There was some question in the mind of the ape-man as to how far he  might carry his unwarranted show of assurance, and he waited therefore  with amused interest the result of his demand. He did not, however,  have long to wait for almost immediately the attitude of his questioner  changed. He whitened, cast an apprehensive glance toward the eastern  sky and then extended his right palm toward Tarzan, placing his left  over his own heart in the sign of amity that was common among the  peoples of Pal-ul-don.    Tarzan stepped quickly back as though from a profaning hand, a feigned  expression of horror and disgust upon his face.    \"Stop!\" he cried, \"who would dare touch the sacred person of the  messenger of Jad-ben-Otho? Only as a special mark of favor from  Jad-ben-Otho may even Ko-tan himself receive this honor from me.  Hasten! Already now have I waited too long! What manner of reception  the Ho-don of A-lur would extend to the son of my father!\"    At first Tarzan had been inclined to adopt the role of Jad-ben-Otho  himself but it occurred to him that it might prove embarrassing and  considerable of a bore to be compelled constantly to portray the  character of a god, but with the growing success of his scheme it had  suddenly occurred to him that the authority of the son of Jad-ben-Otho  would be far greater than that of an ordinary messenger of a god, while  at the same time giving him some leeway in the matter of his acts and  demeanor, the ape-man reasoning that a young god would not be held so  strictly accountable in the matter of his dignity and bearing as an  older and greater god.    This time the effect of his words was immediately and painfully  noticeable upon all those near him. With one accord they shrank back,  the spokesman almost collapsing in evident terror. His apologies, when  finally the paralysis of his fear would permit him to voice them, were  so abject that the ape-man could scarce repress a smile of amused  contempt.    \"Have mercy, O Dor-ul-Otho,\" he pleaded, \"on poor old Dak-lot. Precede  me and I will show you to where Ko-tan, the king, awaits you,  trembling. Aside, snakes and vermin,\" he cried pushing his warriors to  right and left for the purpose of forming an avenue for Tarzan.    \"Come!\" cried the ape-man peremptorily, \"lead the way, and let these  others"]]]
