How, then, have we      to provide a remedy? By strengthening this Government? By      instituting physical force to overawe the States, to coerce the      people living under them as members of sovereign communities to      pass under the yoke of the Federal Government? No, sir; I would      have this Union severed into thirty-three fragments sooner than      have that great evil befall constitutional liberty and      representative government. Our Government is an agency of      delegated and strictly limited powers. Its founders did not look      to its preservation by force; but the chain they wove to bind      these States together was one of love and mutual good offices.      They had broken the fetters of despotic power; they had      separated themselves from the mother-country upon the question      of community independence; and their sons will be degenerate      indeed if, clinging to the mere name and forms of free      government, they forge and rivet upon their posterity the      fetters which their ancestors broke....        \"The remedy for these evils is to be found in the patriotism and      the affection of the people, if it exists; and, if it does not      exist, it is far better, instead of attempting to preserve a      forced and therefore fruitless Union, that we should peacefully      part and each pursue his separate course. It is not to this side      of the Chamber that we should look for propositions; it is not      here that we can ask for remedies. Complaints, with much      amplitude of specification, have gone forth from the members on      this side of the Chamber heretofore. It is not to be expected      that they will be renewed, for the people have taken the subject      into their own hands. States, in their sovereign capacity, have      now resolved to judge of the infractions of the Federal compact,      and of the mode and measure of redress. All we can usefully or      properly do is to send to the people, thus preparing to act for      themselves, evidence of error, if error there be; to transmit to      them the proofs of kind feeling, if it actuates the Northern      section, where they now believe there is only hostility. If we      are mistaken as to your feelings and purposes, give a      substantial proof, that here may begin that circle which hence      may spread out and cover the whole land with proofs of      fraternity, of a reaction in public sentiment, and the assurance      of a future career in conformity with the principles and      purposes of the Constitution. All else is idle. I would not give      the parchment on which the bill would be written that is to      secure our constitutional rights within the limits of a State,      where the people are all opposed to the execution of that law.      It is a truism in free governments that laws rest upon public      opinion, and fall powerless before its determined opposition.        \"The time has passed, sir, when appeals might profitably be made      to sentiment. The time has come when men must of necessity      reason, assemble facts, and deal with current events. I may be      permitted in this to correct an error into which one of my      friends fell this morning, when he impressed on us the great      value of our Union as measured by the amount of time and money      and blood which were spent to form this Union. It cost very      little time, very little money, and no blood. It was one of the      most peaceful transactions that mark the pages of human history.      Our fathers fought the war of the Revolution to maintain the      rights asserted in their Declaration of Independence.\"        Mr. Powell: \"The Senator from Mississippi will allow me to say      that I spoke of the Government, not of the Union. I said time      and money and blood had been required to form the Government.\"        Mr. Davis: \"The Government is the machinery established by the      Constitution; it is the agency created by the States when they      formed the Union. Our fathers, I was proceeding to say, having      fought the war of the Revolution, and achieved their      independence--each State for itself, each State standing out an      integral part, each State separately recognized by the parent      Government of Great Britain--these States as independent      sovereignties entered into confederate alliance. After having      tried the Confederation and found it to be a failure, they, of      their own accord, came peacefully together, and in a brief      period made a Constitution, which was referred to each State and      voluntarily ratified by each State that entered the Union;      little time, little money, and no blood being expended to form      this Government, the machine for making the Union useful and      beneficial. Blood, much and precious, was expended to vindicate      and to establish community independence, and the great American      idea that all governments rest on the consent of the governed,      and that the people may at their will alter or abolish their      government, however or by whomsoever instituted.        \"But our existing Government is not the less sacred to me      because it was not sealed with blood. I honor it the more      because it was the free-will offering of men who chose to live      together. It rooted in fraternity, and fraternity supported its      trunk and all its branches. Every bud and leaflet depends      entirely on the nurture it receives from fraternity as the root      of the tree. When that is destroyed, the trunk decays, and the      branches wither, and the leaves fall; and the shade it was      designed to give has passed away for ever. I cling not merely to      the name and form, but to the spirit and purpose of the Union      which our fathers made. It was for domestic tranquillity; not to      organize within one State lawless bands to commit raids upon      another. It was to provide for the common defense; not to      disband armies and navies, lest they should serve the protection      of one section of the country better than another. It was to      bring the forces of all the States together to achieve a common      object, upholding each the other in amity, and united to repel      exterior force. All the custom-house obstructions existing      between the States were destroyed; the power to regulate      commerce transferred to the General Government. Every barrier to      the freest intercourse was swept away. Under the Confederation      it had been secured as a right to each citizen to have free      transit over all the other States; and under the Union it was      designed to make this more perfect. Is it enjoyed? Is it not      denied? Do we not have mere speculative question of what is      property raised in defiance of the clear intent of the      Constitution, offending as well against its letter as against      its whole spirit? This must be reformed, or the Government our      fathers instituted is destroyed. I say, then, shall we cling to      the mere forms or idolize the name of Union, when its blessings      are lost, after its spirit has fled? Who would keep a flower,      which had lost its beauty and its fragrance, and in their stead      had formed a seed-vessel containing the deadliest poison? Or, to      drop the figure, who would consent to remain in alliance with      States which used the power thus acquired to invade his      tranquillity, to impair his defense, to destroy his peace and      security? Any community would be stronger standing in an      isolated position, and using its revenues to maintain its own      physical force, than if allied with those who would thus war      upon its prosperity and domestic peace; and reason, pride,      self-interest, and the apprehension of secret, constant danger      would impel to separation.        \"I do not comprehend the policy of a Southern Senator who would      seek to change the whole form of our Government, and substitute      Federal force for State obligation and authority. Do we want a      new Government that is to overthrow the old? Do we wish to erect      a central Colossus, wielding at discretion the military arm, and      exercising military force over the people and the States? This      is not the Union to which we were invited; and so carefully was      this guarded that, when our fathers provided for using force to      put down insurrection, they required that the fact of the      insurrection should be communicated by the authorities of the      State before the President could interpose. When it was proposed      to give to Congress power to execute the laws against a      delinquent State, it was refused on the ground that that would      be making war on the States; and, though I know the good purpose      of my honorable friend from Missouri is only to give protection      to constitutional rights, I fear his proposition is to rear a      monster, which will break the feeble chain provided, and destroy      rights it was intended to guard. That military Government which      he is about to institute, by passing into hostile hands, becomes      a weapon for his destruction, not for his protection. All      dangers which we may be called upon to confront as independent      communities are light, in my estimation, compared with that      which would hang over us if this Federal Government had such      physical force; if its character was changed from a      representative agent of States to a central Government, with a      military power to be used at discretion against the States.

Jackson had no intention of awaiting Pope at Manassas,  and after several feints made with a view to misleading the Federal scouts  he finally withdrew to a hidden position between Groveton and Sudley  Springs, to await the arrival of Longstreet, who, taking the same route as  Jackson had done, arrived on the 28th at Thoroughfare Gap and, engaging  Ricketts's division, finally drove it back to Gainesville. On the evening  of this day Jackson's corps held the line Sudley Springs-Groveton, his  right wing near Groveton opposing King's division; and Longstreet held  Thoroughfare Gap, facing Ricketts at Gainesville. On Ricketts's right was  King near Groveton, and the line was continued thence by McDowell's  remaining division and by Sigel's corps to the Stone Bridge. At  Centreville, 7 m. away, was Pope with three divisions, a fourth was  north-east of Manassas Junction, and Porter's corps at Bristoe Station.  Thus, while Ricketts continued at Gainesville to mask Longstreet, Pope  could concentrate a superior force against Jackson, whom he now believed to  be meditating a retreat to the Gap. But a series of misunderstandings  resulted in the withdrawal of Ricketts and King, so that nothing now  intervened between Longstreet and Jackson; while Sigel and McDowell's other  division alone remained to face Jackson until such time as Pope could bring  up the rest of his scattered forces. Jackson now closed on his left and  prepared for battle, and on the morning of the 29th the Confederates,  posted behind a high railway embankment, repelled two sharp attacks made by  Sigel. Pope arrived at noon with the divisions from Centreville, which, led  by the general himself and by Reno and Hooker, two of the bravest officers  in the Union army, made a third and most desperate attack on Jackson's  line. The latter, repulsing it with difficulty, carried its counter-stroke  too far and was in turn repulsed by Grover's brigade of Hooker's division.  Grover then made a fourth assault, but was driven back with terrible loss.  The last assault, gallantly delivered by two divisions under Kearny and  Stevens, drove the Confederate left out of its position; but a Confederate  counter-attack, led by the brave Jubal Early, dislodged the assailants with  the bayonet.    In the meanwhile events had taken place near Groveton which were, for  twenty years after the war, the subject of controversy and recrimination  (see PORTER, FITZ-JOHN). When Porter's and part of McDowell's corps, acting  on various orders sent by Pope, approached Gainesville from the south-east,  Longstreet had already reached that place, and the Federals thus  encountered a force of unknown strength at the moment when Sigel's guns to  the northward showed him to be closely engaged with Jackson. The two  generals consulted, and McDowell marched off to join Sigel, while Porter  remained to hold the new enemy in check. In this he succeeded; Longstreet,  though far superior in numbers, made no forward move, and his advanced  guard alone came into action. On the night of the 29th Lee reunited the  wings of his army on the field of battle. He had forced Pope back many  miles from the Rappahannock, and expecting that the Federals would retire  to the line of Bull Run before giving battle, he now decided to wait for  the last divisions of Longstreet's corps, which were still distant. But  Pope, still sanguine, ordered a \"general pursuit\" of Jackson for the 30th.  There was some ground for his suppositions, for Jackson had retired a short  distance and Longstreet's advanced guard had also fallen back. McDowell,  however, who was in general charge of the Federal right on the 30th, soon  saw that Jackson was not retreating and stopped the \"pursuit,\" and the  attack on Jackson's right, which Pope had ordered Porter to make, was  repulsed by Longstreet's overwhelming forces. Then Lee's whole line, 4 m.  long, made its grand counter-stroke (4 P.M.). There was now no hesitation  in Longstreet's attack; the Federal left was driven successively from every  position it took up, and Longstreet finally captured Bald Hill. Jackson,  though opposed by the greater part of Pope's forces, advanced to the  Matthews hill, and his artillery threatened the Stone Bridge. The Federals,  driven back to the banks of Bull Run, were only saved by the gallant  defence of the Henry House hill by the Pennsylvanian division of Reynolds  and the regulars [v.04 p.0793] under Sykes. Pope withdrew under cover of  night to Centreville. Here he received fresh reinforcements, but Jackson  was already marching round his new right, and after the action of Chantilly  (1st of September) the whole Federal army fell back to Washington. The  Union forces present on the field on the 29th and 30th numbered about  63,000, the strength of Lee's army being on the same dates about 54,000.  Besides their killed and wounded the Federals lost very heavily in  prisoners.    BULLY (of uncertain origin, but possibly connected with a Teutonic word  seen in many compounds, as the Low Ger. _bullerjaan_, meaning \"noisy\"; the  word has also, with less probability, been derived from the Dutch _boel_,  and Ger. _Buhle_, a lover), originally a fine, swaggering fellow, as in  \"Bully Bottom\" in _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, later an overbearing  ruffian, especially a coward who abuses his strength by ill-treating the  weak; more technically a _souteneur_, a man who lives on the earnings of a  prostitute. The term in its early use of \"fine\" or \"splendid\" survives in  American slang.    BUeLOW, BERNHARD ERNST VON (1815-1879), Danish and German statesman, was the  son of Adolf von Buelow, a Danish official, and was born at Cismar in  Holstein on the 2nd of August 1815. He studied law at the universities of  Berlin, Goettingen and Kiel, and began his political career in the service  of Denmark, in the chancery of Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenburg at Copenhagen,  and afterwards in the foreign office. In 1842 he became councillor of  legation, and in 1847 Danish _charge d'affaires_ in the Hanse towns, where  his intercourse with the merchant princes led to his marriage in 1848 with  a wealthy heiress, Louise Victorine Ruecker. When the insurrection broke out  in the Elbe duchies (1848) he left the Danish service, and offered his  services to the provisional government of Kiel, an offer that was not  accepted. In 1849, accordingly, he re-entered the service of Denmark, was  appointed a royal chamberlain and in 1850 sent to represent the duchies of  Schleswig and Holstein at the restored federal diet of Frankfort. Here he  came into intimate touch with Bismarck, who admired his statesmanlike  handling of the growing complications of the Schleswig-Holstein Question.  With the radical \"Eider-Dane\" party he was utterly out of sympathy; and  when, in 1862, this party gained the upper hand, he was recalled from  Frankfort. He now entered the service of the grand-duke of  Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and remained at the head of the grand-ducal  government until 1867, when he became plenipotentiary for the two  Mecklenburg duchies in the council of the German Confederation (Bundesrat),  where he distinguished himself by his successful defence of the medieval  constitution of the duchies against Liberal attacks. In 1873 Bismarck, who  was in thorough sympathy with his views, persuaded him to enter the service  of Prussia as secretary of state for foreign affairs, and from this time  till his death he was the chancellor's most faithful henchman. In 1875 he  was appointed Prussian plenipotentiary in the Bundesrat; in 1877 he became  Bismarck's lieutenant in the secretaryship for foreign affairs of the  Empire; and in 1878 he was, with Bismarck and Hohenlohe, Prussian  plenipotentiary at the congress of Berlin. He died at Frankfort on the 20th  of October 1879, his end being hastened by his exertions in connexion with  the political crisis of that year. Of his six sons the eldest, Bernhard  Heinrich Karl (see below), became chancellor of the Empire.    See the biography of H. von Petersdorff in _Allgemeine deutsche  Biographie_, Band 47, p. 350.    BUeLOW, BERNHARD HEINRICH KARL MARTIN, PRINCE VON (1849- ), German  statesman, was born on the 3rd of May 1849, at Klein-Flottbeck, in  Holstein. The Buelow family is one very widely extended in north Germany,  and many members have attained distinction in the civil and military  service of Prussia, Denmark and Mecklenburg. Prince Buelow's great-uncle,  Heinrich von Buelow, who was distinguished for his admiration of England and  English institutions, was Prussian ambassador in England from 1827 to 1840,  and married a daughter of Wilhelm von Humboldt (see the letters of  Gabrielle von Buelow). His father, Bernhard Ernst von Buelow, is separately  noticed above.    Prince Buelow must not be confused with his contemporary Otto v. Buelow  (1827-1901), an official in the Prussian foreign office, who in 1882 was  appointed German envoy at Bern, from 1892 to 1898 was Prussian envoy to the  Vatican, and died at Rome on the 22nd of November 1901.    Bernhard von Buelow, after serving in the Franco-Prussian War, entered the  Prussian civil service, and was then transferred to the diplomatic service.  In 1876 he was appointed attache to the German embassy in Paris, and after  returning for a while to the foreign office at Berlin, became second  secretary to the embassy in Paris in 1880. From 1884 he was first secretary  to the embassy at St Petersburg, and acted as _charge d'affaires_; in 1888  he was appointed envoy at Bucharest, and in 1893 to the post of German  ambassador at Rome. In 1897, on the retirement of Baron Marshall von  Bieberstein, he was appointed secretary of state for foreign affairs (the  same office which his father had held) under Prince Hohenlohe, with a seat  in the Prussian ministry. The appointment caused much surprise at the time,  as Buelow was little known outside diplomatic circles. The"]]]
