Later in history, Charles IX declared William of Nassau \"an  outlaw\" and his principality \"confiscate\"; and in 1571, there was a  three days' massacre of Protestants. In spite of this horrid orgy the  Reformers rose again in might and soon prevented all celebration of  Catholic rites. Refugees fleeing from the Dragonnades of Dauphine and of  the Cevennes poured into the principality; and when the Princes of  Orange were strong enough to protect their state, its Catholics lived  restricted lives; but when the Protestant power waned, Kings and  Captains of France raided the land in the name of the Church. And at  the death of William of Orange, King of England, Louis XIV seized the  capital of the state, razed its great palace and its walls, and after  the Treaty of Utrecht had awarded the principality to the French crown,  treated the defenceless Huguenots with the same impartial cruelty he had  meted to their fellow-believers in other parts of the kingdom. Orange's  changes in religious fate are not unlike those of Nimes, with this  essential difference, that here Catholicism has conquered triumphantly.  Where ten worship in the little Protestant temple, a thousand throng to  the Mass.    Both in history and its monumental Roman ruins, the capital of this  province, Orange, is one of the richest cities of the Southland, but its  Cathedral is very poor and mean. The plan is one of the simplest of the  Provencal conceptions, a \"hall basilica,\" archaeologically interesting,  but in its present state of patch and repair, architecturally  commonplace and unbeautiful. In spite of Protestant attacks and Catholic  restorations, the XI century type has been maintained, a rectangle whose  plain double arches support a tunnel vault and divide the interior into  four bays. The piers are heavy and severe; and between them are alcoves,  used as chapels. The choir, narrower than the nave, is preceded by the  usual dome, and beyond it is a little unused apse, concealed from the  rest of the interior by a wall. Unimportant windows built with  distinctly utilitarian purpose successfully light this small, simple  room, and no kindly shadow hides its bareness or diminishes the unhappy  effect of the paintings which disfigure the walls. The Cathedral's  exterior is so surrounded by irregular old houses that the traveller had  discovered it with some difficulty. It has little that is worthy of  description, and after having entered by a conspicuously poor  Renaissance portal only to go out under an uninteresting modern one, he  found himself lost in wonder that the Cathedral-builders of  Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth should have utterly failed in a town which  offered them such inspiring suggestions as the great Arch of Triumph and  the still greater Imperial Theatre, besides all the other remains of  Roman antiquity which, long after the building of Notre-Dame, the  practical Maurice of Orange demolished for the making of his mediaeval  castle.      [Sidenote: Cavaillon.]    It was growing dusk, of a spring evening, when the traveller arrived at  Cavaillon and wandered about the narrow streets and came upon the  Cathedral. Glimpses of an interesting dome and a turret-tower had  appeared once or twice above the house-tops, leading him on with  freshened interest, and there was still light enough for many first  impressions when he arrived before the low cloister-door. But here was  no place for peaceful meditation. An old woman, coiffed and bent,  brushed past him as she entered, a chair in each hand; and as he effaced  himself against the church wall, a younger woman went by, also  chair-laden. Two or three others came, talking eagerly, little girls in  all stages of excitement ran in and out, and little boys came and went,  divided between assumed carelessness and a feeling of unusual  responsibility. Then a priest appeared on the threshold, not in  meditation, but on business. Another, old and heavy, and panting,  hurried in; and through the cloister-door, Monsieur le Cure, breviary in  hand, prayed watchfully. A little fellow, running, fell down, and the  priest sprang to lift him; the child was too small not to wish to cry,  but too much in haste to stop for tears. The priest watched him with a  kindly shrug and a smile as he ran on;--there was no time for laughing  or crying, there was time for nothing but the mysterious matter in hand.    \"What is it?\" the traveller finally asked.    \"Ah, Monsieur, to-morrow is the day of the First Communion. We all have  just prayed, just confessed, in the church; and our parents are  arranging their places. For to-morrow there will be crowds--everybody.  You too, Monsieur, are coming perhaps? The Mass is at half-past six.\"    Such was the living interest of the place that the traveller moved away  without any very clear architectural impression of the Cathedral, except  of the curiously narrow bell-turret and of the height of the dome.    He did not see the early Mass, but toward ten wandered again to the  Cathedral and entered the cloister-door. It was a low-vaulted, sombre  little Cloister which all the chattering, animated crowds could not  brighten. Formerly two sides were gated off, and priests alone walked  there. The other sides were public passage-ways to the church. Now only  the iron grooves of the gates of separation remain, and the four walks  were thronged with people. Little girls in the white dresses of their  First Communion, veiled and crowned with roses, were hurrying to their  places; an old grandmother, with her arm around one of the little  communicants, knelt by a column, gazing up to the Virgin of the  cloister-close; proud and anxious parents led their children into  church, and friends met and kissed on both cheeks. In one corner, an old  woman was driving a busy trade in penny-worths of barley candy.  Diminutive altar-boys in white lace cassocks and red, fur-trimmed  capes, offered religious papers for sale. It was a harvest day for  beggars, and \"for the love of the good God\" many a sou was given into  feeble dirty hands.    [Illustration: \"IT WAS A LOW-VAULTED, SOMBRE LITTLE CLOISTER.\"  CAVAILLON.]    For a time the traveller walked about the Cloister, so tiny and worn a  Cloister that on any other day it must have seemed melancholy indeed. So  low a vaulting is not often found, massive and rounded and seeming to  press, lowering, above the head. The columns, which help to support its  weight, are short and heavy and thick, so worn that their capitals are  sometimes only suggestive and sometimes meaningless. On one side the  carving is distinctly Corinthian; on another altogether lacking. Between  the columns, one could glance into a close so small that ten paces would  measure its length. It was a charming little spot, all filled with  flowers and plants that told of some one's constant, tender care. From  above the nodding flowers and leaves rose the statue of the Madonna and  the Child.    The tolling bell called laggards to Mass. With them, the traveller  entered the church, and found it so crowded that it was only after  receiving many knocks from incoming children, and sundry blows on the  head and shoulders from ladies who carried their chairs too carelessly,  after minutes of time and a store of patience, that he finally reached a  haven, a corner of the Chapel of Saint-Veran. There, under the care of  the Cathedral's Patron, he escaped further injuries and assisted at a  long, interesting ceremony.    Mass had already begun, but the voice of the priest and the answering  organ were lost in the movement of excited friends, the murmur of  questions, and the clatter of nailed shoes on the stone floor. A Suisse,  halberd in hand, and gorgeous in tri-cornered hat and the red and gold  of office, kept the aisle-ways open with firm but kind insistence; and  the priests who were directing the children in the body of the church,  were wise enough to overlook the disorder, which was not irreverence,  but interest. For days, everybody had been thinking of this ceremony;  everybody wanted \"good places.\" But few found them. For the little nave  of the church was chiefly given up to the communicants. They sat on long  benches, facing each other. The boys, sixty or seventy of them, were  nearest the Altar; the girls, even more numerous, nearest the door. A  young priest walked between the rows of boys and the old, panting Father  directed the girls.    The whole interior of the church, at whose consecration no less a  prelate than Pope Innocent IV had presided, is small and its plan is  essentially of the Provencal type. The high tunnel vault rests, like  that of Orange, on double arches; and as the nave is very narrow and its  light very dim, the church seems lofty, sombre, and impressive, with a  very serious dignity which its detail fails to carry out. The chapels,  which lie between the heavy buttresses, are dim recesses which increase  the darkened effect of the interior. Of the ten, only three differ  essentially from the general plan; and although of the XVII century,  their style is so severe and they are so ill-lighted that they do not  greatly debase the church. The choir is entered from under a rounded  archway, and its dome is loftier than the nave and much more beautiful  than the semi-dome of the apse, whose roof, in these practical modern  times, has been windowed.    That which almost destroys the effect of the church's fine lines and  would be intolerable in a stronger light, is the mass of gilt and  polychrome with which the interior is covered. The altars are  monstrously showy, the walls and buttresses are coloured, and even the  interesting, sculptured figures beneath the corbels have been carefully  tinted. The dead arise with appropriate mortuary pallor, the halo of  Christ is pure gold, and all the draperies of God and His saints are in  true, primary shadings.    From the contemplation of this misuse of paint, and of a sadly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#19)"],[1,"breeds the individuals of which to an  unpractised eye would appear absolutely similar, which would give, it  might have been thought, no scope to selection, the whole appearance of  the animal has been changed in a few years (as in the case of Lord  Western's sheep), so that practised agriculturalists could scarcely  credit that a change had not been effected by a cross with other breeds.  Breeders both of plants and animals frequently give their means of  selection greater scope, by crossing different breeds and selecting the  offspring; but we shall have to recur to this subject again.    The external conditions will doubtless influence and modify the results  of the most careful selection; it has been found impossible to prevent  certain breeds of cattle from degenerating on mountain pastures; it  would probably be impossible to keep the plumage of the wild-duck in the  domesticated race; in certain soils, no care has been sufficient to  raise cauliflower seed true to its character; and so in many other  cases. But with patience it is wonderful what man has effected. He has  selected and therefore in one sense made one breed of horses to race and  another to pull; he has made sheep with fleeces good for carpets and  other sheep good for broadcloth; he has, in the same sense, made one dog  to find game and give him notice when found, and another dog to fetch  him the game when killed; he has made by selection the fat to lie mixed  with the meat in one breed and in another to accumulate in the bowels  for the tallow-chandler{199}; he has made the legs of one breed of  pigeons long, and the beak of another so short, that it can hardly feed  itself; he has previously determined how the feathers on a bird's body  shall be coloured, and how the petals of many flowers shall be streaked  or fringed, and has given prizes for complete success;--by selection, he  has made the leaves of one variety and the flower-buds of another  variety of the cabbage good to eat, at different seasons of the year;  and thus has he acted on endless varieties. I do not wish to affirm that  the long-and short-wooled sheep, or that the pointer and retriever, or  that the cabbage and cauliflower have certainly descended from one and  the same aboriginal wild stock; if they have not so descended, though it  lessens what man has effected, a large result must be left unquestioned.         {199} See the Essay of 1842, p. 3.    In saying as I have done that man makes a breed, let it not be  confounded with saying that man makes the individuals, which are given  by nature with certain desirable qualities; man only adds together and  makes a permanent gift of nature's bounties. In several cases, indeed,  for instance in the \"Ancon\" sheep, valuable from not getting over  fences, and in the turnspit dog, man has probably only prevented  crossing; but in many cases we positively know that he has gone on  selecting, and taking advantage of successive small variations.    Selection{200} has been _methodically_ followed, as I have said, for  barely a century; but it cannot be doubted that occasionally it has been  practised from the remotest ages, in those animals completely under the  dominion of man. In the earliest chapters of the Bible there are rules  given for influencing the colours of breeds, and black and white sheep  are spoken of as separated. In the time of Pliny the barbarians of  Europe and Asia endeavoured by cross-breeding with a wild stock to  improve the races of their dogs and horses. The savages of Guyana now do  so with their dogs: such care shows at least that the characters of  individual animals were attended to. In the rudest times of English  history, there were laws to prevent the exportation of fine animals of  established breeds, and in the case of horses, in Henry VIII's time,  laws for the destruction of all horses under a certain size. In one of  the oldest numbers of the _Phil. Transactions_, there are rules for  selecting and improving the breeds of sheep. Sir H. Bunbury, in 1660,  has given rules for selecting the finest seedling plants, with as much  precision as the best recent horticulturalist could. Even in the most  savage and rude nations, in the wars and famines which so frequently  occur, the most useful of their animals would be preserved: the value  set upon animals by savages is shown by the inhabitants of Tierra del  Fuego devouring their old women before their dogs, which as they  asserted are useful in otter-hunting{201}: who can doubt but that in  every case of famine and war, the best otter-hunters would be preserved,  and therefore in fact selected for breeding. As the offspring so  obviously take after their parents, and as we have seen that savages  take pains in crossing their dogs and horses with wild stocks, we may  even conclude as probable that they would sometimes pair the most useful  of their animals and keep their offspring separate. As different races  of men require and admire different qualities in their domesticated  animals, each would thus slowly, though unconsciously, be selecting a  different breed. As Pallas has remarked, who can doubt but that the  ancient Russian would esteem and endeavour to preserve those sheep in  his flocks which had the thickest coats. This kind of insensible  selection by which new breeds are not selected and kept separate, but a  peculiar character is slowly given to the whole mass of the breed, by  often saving the life of animals with certain characteristics, we may  feel nearly sure, from what we see has been done by the more direct  method of separate selection within the last 50 years in England, would  in the course of some thousand years produce a marked effect.         {200} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 33, vi. p. 38. The evidence is given       in the present Essay rather more fully than in the _Origin_.         {201} _Journal of Researches_, Ed. 1860, p. 214. \"Doggies catch       otters, old women no.\"      _Crossing Breeds._    When once two or more races are formed, or if more than one race, or  species fertile _inter se_, originally existed in a wild state, their  crossing becomes a most copious source of new races{202}. When two  well-marked races are crossed the offspring in the first generation take  more or less after either parent or are quite intermediate between them,  or rarely assume characters in some degree new. In the second and  several succeeding generations, the offspring are generally found to  vary exceedingly, one compared with another, and many revert nearly to  their ancestral forms. This greater variability in succeeding  generations seems analogous to the breaking or variability of organic  beings after having been bred for some generations under  domestication{203}. So marked is this variability in cross-bred  descendants, that Pallas and some other naturalists have supposed that  all variation is due to an original cross; but I conceive that the  history of the potato, Dahlia, Scotch Rose, the guinea-pig, and of many  trees in this country, where only one species of the genus exists,  clearly shows that a species may vary where there can have been no  crossing. Owing to this variability and tendency to reversion in  cross-bred beings, much careful selection is requisite to make  intermediate or new permanent races: nevertheless crossing has been a  most powerful engine, especially with plants, where means of propagation  exist by which the cross-bred varieties can be secured without incurring  the risk of fresh variation from seminal propagation: with animals the  most skilful agriculturalists now greatly prefer careful selection from  a well-established breed, rather than from uncertain cross-bred stocks.         {202} The effects of crossing is much more strongly stated here       than in the _Origin_. See Ed. i. p. 20, vi. p. 23, where indeed the       opposite point of view is given. His change of opinion may be due       to his work on pigeons. The whole of the discussion on crossing       corresponds to Chapter VIII of the _Origin_, Ed. i. rather than to       anything in the earlier part of the book.         {203} The parallelism between the effects of a cross and the       effects of conditions is given from a different point of view in       the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 266, vi. p. 391. See the experimental       evidence for this important principle in the author's work on       _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_. Professor Bateson has suggested       that the experiments should be repeated with gametically pure       plants.    Although intermediate and new races may be formed by the mingling of  others, yet if the two races are allowed to mingle quite freely, so that  none of either parent race remain pure, then, especially if the parent  races are not widely different, they will slowly blend together, and the  two races will be destroyed, and one mongrel race left in its place.  This will of course happen in a shorter time, if one of the parent  races exists in greater number than the other. We see the effect of this  mingling, in the manner in which the aboriginal breeds of dogs and pigs  in the Oceanic Islands and the many breeds of our domestic animals  introduced into S. America, have all been lost and absorbed in a mongrel  race. It is probably owing to the freedom of crossing, that, in  uncivilised countries, where inclosures do not exist, we seldom meet  with more than one race of a species: it is only in enclosed countries,  where the inhabitants do not migrate, and have conveniences for  separating the several kinds of domestic animals, that we meet with a  multitude of races. Even in civilised countries, want of care for a few  years has been found to destroy the good results of far longer periods  of selection and separation.    This power of crossing will affect the races of all _terrestrial_  animals; for all terrestrial animals require for their reproduction the  union of two individuals. Amongst"]]]
