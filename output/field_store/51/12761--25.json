Londoners had already experienced the force of his arm and  his ability in the field, when he scattered them at Lewes; they were now  to experience the benefit of his powers of organization in time of peace.  Fitz-Thedmar's chronicle now fails us, but we have a new source of  information in the letter books(303) of the Corporation.    (M192)    The first and the most pressing difficulty which presented itself to  Edward, was the re-organization of finance. Without money the barons could  not be kept within legitimate bounds. Having won their cause against the  usurpations of the crown, they began to turn their arms upon each other,  and it required Edward's strong hand not only to impose order upon his  unruly nobles, but also, to bring Scotland and Wales into submission. The  country was flooded with clipt coin. This was called in, and new money  minted at the Tower, under the supervision of Gregory de Rokesley as  Master of the Exchange.(304) Parliament made large grants to the king; and  he further increased his resources by imposing knighthood upon all  freeholders of estates worth L20 a year.(305) When the Welsh war was  renewed in 1282, the city sent him 6,000 marks by the hands of Waleys and  Rokesley.(306)    (M193)    In 1283 an extraordinary assembly--styled a parliament by some  chroniclers--was summoned to meet at Shrewsbury to attend the trial of  David, brother of Llewelyn, Prince of Wales. To this so-called parliament  the city sent no less than six representatives, viz.: Henry le Waleys, the  mayor, Gregory de Rokesley, Philip Cissor, or the tailor, Ralph Crepyn,  Joce le Acatour, or merchant, and John de Gisors.(307) Their names are  worthy of record, inasmuch as they are the first known representatives of  the city in any assembly deserving the name of a parliament, the names of  those attending Simon de Montfort's parliament not having been transmitted  to us. David was convicted and barbarously executed, his head being  afterwards carried to London, and set up on the Tower, where his brother's  head, with a mock crown of ivy, had recently been placed.(308)    (M194)    Of Ralph Crepyn, one of the city's representatives at Shrewsbury, a tragic  story is told. Meeting, one day, Laurence Duket, his rival in the  affections of a woman known as \"Alice atte Bowe,\" the two came to blows,  and Crepyn was wounded. The affray took place in Cheapside, and Duket,  fearing he had killed his man, sought sanctuary in Bow Church. Crepyn's  friends, hearing of the matter, followed and having killed Duket, disposed  of their victim's body in such a way as to suggest suicide. It so  happened, however, that the sacrilegious murder had been witnessed by a  boy who informed against the culprits and no less than sixteen persons  were hanged for the part they had taken in it. Alice, herself, was  condemned to be burnt alive as being the chief instigator of the murder;  others, including Ralph Crepyn, were sent to the Tower, and only released  on payment of heavy fines.(309) The church was placed under interdict, the  doors and windows being filled with thorns until purification had been  duly made. Duket's remains, which had been interred as those of a suicide,  were afterwards taken up and received the rights of Christian burial in  Bow Churchyard.    (M195)    The year 1285 was a memorable one both for London and the kingdom. It  witnessed the passing of two important statutes. In the first place the  statute _De Donis_ legalised the principle of tying up real estate, so as  to descend, in an exclusive perpetual line; in other words, it sanctioned  entails, and its effect is still experienced at the present day in every  ordinary settlement of land. In the next place the Assise of Arms of Henry  II was improved so as to secure for the king a national support in the  time of danger. In every hundred and franchise each man's armour was to be  viewed twice a year; and defaults reported to the king \"who would find a  remedy.\" The gates of walled towns were to be closed from sun-set to  sun-rise, and watch and ward were to be kept as strictly as in times past,  \"that is to wit, from the day of the Ascension until the day of S.  Michael, in every city by six men at every gate; in every borough, twelve  men; every town, six or four, according to the number of the inhabitants  of the town, and they shall watch the town continually all night from the  sun-setting unto the sun-rising.\"(310) Three years previous to the passing  of this statute the mayor, alderman and chamberlain had made very similar  provisions for the keeping of the City of London, the city's gates, and  the river Thames.(311)    (M196)    For the city, the year was a memorable one, owing to the suspension of its  franchise. The circumstances which caused the loss of its liberties for a  period of thirteen years (1285-1298) were these. The king's justiciars  were sitting at the Tower, where the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of the  city had been summoned to attend. Owing to some informality in the  summons, Gregory de Rokesley, the Mayor, declined to attend in his  official capacity, but formally \"deposed himself\" at the Church of All  Hallows Barking--the limit of the city jurisdiction-- by handing the city's  seal to Stephen Aswy or Eswy, a brother alderman. On entering the chamber  where sat the justiciars, the mayor excused his unofficial appearance on  the ground of insufficient notice. This was not what the justiciars had  been accustomed to. On the contrary, the citizens had usually shown  studied respect towards the justiciars whenever they came to the Tower for  the purpose of holding pleas of the crown.    (M197)    The rules of procedure on such occasions are fully set out in the city's  \"Liber Albus,\"(312) and they contain, curiously enough, a provision  expressly made for cases where the full notice of forty days had not been  given. In such an event the prescribed rule was to send some of their more  discreet citizens to the king and his council to ask for the appointment  of another day. Whether Rokesley had taken this step before resorting to  the measures he did we are not told. It was also the custom on such  occasions for the citizens to gather at Barking Church, clothed in their  best apparel, and thence proceed in a body to the Tower. A deputation was  appointed--selected members of the common council--who should also proceed  to the Tower for the purpose of giving an official welcome to the  justiciars on behalf of the citizens. It was not thought to be in any way  derogatory to secure the goodwill of the king's justiciars by making ample  presents. It had been done time out of mind. The sheriffs and aldermen  were to attend with their respective sergeants and beadles, the benches at  the Tower were to be examined beforehand and necessary repairs carried  out, all shops were to be closed and no business transacted during the  session. In a word, everything was to be done that could add to the  dignity of the justiciars and the solemnity of the occasion. In contrast  with all this, Rokesley's conduct was indeed strange, and leads us to  suppose that his action was caused by some other and stronger reason than  the mere omission to give the usual notice of the coming of the king's  justiciars.    (M198)    Be this as it may, the king's treasurer, who may possibly have been  forewarned of what was about to take place, at once decided what course to  take. He declared the city to be there and then taken into the king's  hands, on the pretext that it was found to be without a mayor, and he  summoned the citizens to appear on the morrow before the king at  Westminster. When the morrow came, the citizens duly appeared, and about  eighty of them were detained. Those who accompanied Rokesley to Barking  Church on the previous day were confined in the Tower, but after a few  days they were all set at liberty, with the exception of Stephen Aswy, who  was removed in custody to Windsor.(313)    (M199)    The king appointed Ralph de Sandwich _custos_ or warden of the city,  enjoining him at the same time to observe the liberties and customs of the  citizens, and for the next thirteen years (1285-1298) the city continued  to be governed by a warden in the person of Sandwich or of John le Breton,  whilst the sheriffs were sometimes appointed by the Exchequer and  sometimes chosen by the citizens.(314)    (M200)    In May, 1286, the king went to Gascony, leaving the country in charge of  his nephew, Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, and did not return until August,  1289. He was then in sore straits for money, as was so often the case with  him, and was glad of a present of L1,000 which the citizens offered by way  of courtesy (_curialitas_). The money was ordered (14th October) to be  levied by poll,(315) but many of the inhabitants were so poor that they  could only find pledges for future payment, and these pledges were  afterwards sold for what they would fetch.(316) A twelve-month later  (October, 1290) when Edward visited London, he was fain to be content with  the smaller sum of 1,000 marks.(317)    (M201)    The expulsion of the Jews in 1290 increased Edward's difficulties, for on  them he chiefly depended for replenishing his empty exchequer. Their  expulsion was not so much his own wish as the wish of his subjects, who,  being largely in debt to the Jews, regarded them as cruel tyrants. The  nation soon discovered that it had made a mistake in thus getting rid of  its creditors, for in the absence of the Jews, Edward was compelled to  resort to the Lombard merchants. It may possibly have been owing to some  monetary transactions between them that the king was solicitous of getting  a life interest in the city's Small Beam made over to a lady known as  Jacobina la Lumbard. No particulars are known of this lady, but to judge  from her name she probably came of a family of money-lenders, and if so,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],[0,"The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#19)"],[1,"   BIG S.

Then I wish I was a little boy again. I'm too big to enjoy  myself.    BIG T. And I wish I was a little girl again. Everybody laughs at me,  'cause I'm so big.    BIG S.

WISHING MAN (_looks in the little pill box_). Yes, but it's only one  fern seed. Only one of you can be made little again.    BIG D. Give it to my sister, Tootsy. She's a girl.    BIG T. No, give it to Dumpling. He's the oldest.    WISHING MAN. I think I'll give it to 'ittie Snookie Ookums. Here,  Snookums, take that little seed and go down by the pump and get a  drink of water.

They're dreadfully hard to raise. They require so much  attention. I have to keep them under cover to protect them from the  sun. The wax melts so easily and the pretty red cheeks are apt to run  down over their pretty French dresses. (_Removes cover._) How nice  they look. There's Annette, Olivette and Babette.

They're such pretty dollies that I think I'll  give them to little boys instead of little girls. I'll give Annette to  (_insert little boy's name_) and I'll give Olivette to ----, and  little Babette I'll give to ----.

The room was all in shimmering white with a background of small pine  trees in large wooden pots. The floor was covered with white muslin  and scattered with leaves, pine needles and cones.    In one corner was a giant snow pile, made of a frame covered with  cotton. This was presided over by the Snow Queen and her Maids and  white-wrapped bundles were on sale for five cents.    Jack Frost and his boys presided over a large tree in another corner.  Small toys wrapped in white tissue paper were attached to this tree  and sold for five cents. Or Santa Claus may preside at the sale.    Snowballs of white popcorn and snowballs filled with candy were on  sale at another booth, presided over by red and white Striped Candy  Girls. Candy canes were also sold here.    In the fourth corner a snow scene in the woods was depicted. A local  acrobat, dressed as a Snow-man, did stunts, assisted by several boys  dressed as clowns. They pelted the Snow-man with snowballs and then  sold bags of white confetti. The Snow-man also ran a game where  snowballs were thrown at a target. The target was a circle of black  cambric, the snowballs were rubber balls covered with raw cotton and  rolled in flour. Balls sold three for five cents.    A postoffice in charge of Mrs. Santa Claus is recommended, where each  pays five cents postage due for packages and postcards.    If snowballing the target is too \"mussy,\" a large holly wreath with a  cluster of sleighbells in the center may be suspended from the ceiling  with red and green streamers. Three balls of soft rubber are provided  and the contestants try to throw the balls through the wreath and ring  the bells.    Stuffed stockings on a clothesline may be offered for sale. This  should be presided over by Moll Pitcher and her colonial wash-maids.    A rummage sale of toys added quite a large sum to the general fund.  There was a 5-cent table, a 10-cent table and a 25-cent table.      THE SCENERY FOR THE PLAY.    The rear of the stage should be hung with dark curtains. Arrange the  trumpet vine and the trees in place before the play begins. Then hide  them with screens, these screens serving as the \"scenery\" for Act I.    During the progress of Act II, in front of the front curtain, remove  the screens and furniture of Act I and arrange the stage for Act III  as described in the text.    For the thunder"]]]
