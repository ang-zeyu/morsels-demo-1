But  tell me that, and I give back the eye.\"    Then they whimpered and begged of him, and when they found that all  their beseeching was in vain, at length they told him.    \"Go south,\" they said, \"so far south that at length thou comest to the  uttermost limits of the sea, to the place where the day and night  meet. There is the Garden of the Hesperides, and of them must thou  ask the way.\" And \"Give us back our eye!\" they wailed again most  piteously, and Perseus gave back the eye into a greedy trembling old  hand, and flew south like a swallow that is glad to leave the gloomy  frozen lands behind.    To the garden of the Hesperides he came at last, and amongst the  myrtles and roses and sunny fountains he came on the nymphs who there  guard the golden fruit, and begged them to tell him whither he must  wing his way in order to find the Gorgons. But the nymphs could not  tell.    \"We must ask Atlas,\" they said, \"the giant who sits high up on the  mountain and with his strong shoulders keeps the heavens and earth  apart.\"    And with the nymphs Perseus went up the mountain and asked the patient  giant to guide him to the place of his quest.    \"Far away I can see them,\" said Atlas, \"on an island in the great  ocean. But unless thou wert to wear the helmet of Pluto himself, thy  going must be in vain.\"    \"What is this helmet?\" asked Perseus, \"and how can I gain it?\"    \"Didst thou wear the helmet of the ruler of Dark Places, thou wouldst  be as invisible as a shadow in the blackness of night,\" answered  Atlas; \"but no mortal can obtain it, for only the Immortals can brave  the terrors of the Shadowy Land and yet return; yet if thou wilt  promise me one thing, the helmet shall be thine.\"    \"What wouldst thou?\" asked Perseus.    And Atlas said, \"For many a long year have I borne this earth, and I  grow aweary of my burden. When thou hast slain Medusa, let me gaze  upon her face, that I may be turned into stone and suffer no more  forever.\"    And Perseus promised, and at the bidding of Atlas one of the nymphs  sped down to the land of the Shades, and for seven days Perseus and  her sisters awaited her return. Her face was as the face of a white  lily and her eyes were dark with sadness when she came, but with her  she bore the helmet of Pluto, and when she and her sisters had kissed  Perseus and bidden him a sorrowful farewell, he put on the helmet and  vanished away.    Soon the gentle light of day had gone, and he found himself in a place  where clammy fog blotted out all things, and where the sea was black  as the water of that stream that runs through the Cocytus valley. And  in that silent land where there is \"neither night nor day, nor cloud  nor breeze nor storm,\" he found the cave of horrors in which the  Gorgons dwelt.    Two of them, like monstrous swine, lay asleep,        \"But a third woman paced about the hall,      And ever turned her head from wall to wall,      And moaned aloud and shrieked in her despair,      Because the golden tresses of her hair      Were moved by writhing snakes from side to side,      That in their writhing oftentimes would glide      On to her breast or shuddering shoulders white;      Or, falling down, the hideous things would light      Upon her feet, and, crawling thence, would twine      Their slimy folds upon her ankles fine.\"            William Morris.    In the shield of Pallas Athene the picture was mirrored, and as  Perseus gazed on it his soul grew heavy for the beauty and the horror  of Medusa. And \"Oh that it had been her foul sisters that I must  slay!\" he thought at first, but then--\"To slay her will be kind  indeed,\" he said. \"Her beauty has become corruption, and all the joy  of life for her has passed into the agony of remembrance, the torture  of unending remorse.\"    And when he saw her brazen claws that still were greedy and lustful to  strike and to slay, his face grew stern, and he paused no longer, but  with his sword he smote her neck with all his might and main. And to  the rocky floor the body of Medusa fell with brazen clang, but her  head he wrapped in the goatskin, while he turned his eyes away. Aloft  then he sprang, and flew swifter than an arrow from the bow of Diana.    With hideous outcry the two other Gorgons found the body of Medusa,  and, like foul vultures that hunt a little song-bird, they flew in  pursuit of Perseus. For many a league they kept up the chase, and  their howling was grim to hear. Across the seas they flew, and over  the yellow sand of the Libyan desert, and as Perseus flew before them,  some blood-drops fell from the severed head of Medusa, and from them  bred the vipers that are found in the desert to this day. But bravely  did the winged shoes of Hermes bear Perseus on, and by nightfall the  Gorgon sisters had passed from sight, and Perseus found himself once  more in the garden of the Hesperides. Ere he sought the nymphs, he  knelt by the sea to cleanse from his hands Medusa's blood, and still  does the seaweed that we find on sea-beaches after a storm bear the  crimson stains.    And when Perseus had received glad welcome from the fair dwellers in  the garden of the Hesperides, he sought Atlas, that to him he might  fulfil his promise; and eagerly Atlas beheld him, for he was aweary of  his long toil.    So Perseus uncovered the face of Medusa and held it up for the Titan  to gaze upon.    And when Atlas looked upon her whose beauty had once been pure and  living as that of a flower in spring, and saw only anguish and  cruelty, foul wickedness, and hideous despair, his heart grew like  stone within him. To stone, too, turned his great, patient face, and  into stone grew his vast limbs and strong, crouching back. So did  Atlas the Titan become Atlas the Mountain, and still his head,  white-crowned with snow, and his great shoulder far up in misty  clouds, would seem to hold apart the earth and the sky.    Then Perseus again took flight, and in his flight he passed over many  lands and suffered weariness and want, and sometimes felt his faith  growing low. Yet ever he sped on, hoping ever, enduring ever. In Egypt  he had rest and was fed and honoured by the people of the land, who  were fain to keep him to be one of their gods. And in a place called  Chemmis they built a statue of him when he had gone, and for many  hundreds of years it stood there. And the Egyptians said that ever and  again Perseus returned, and that when he came the Nile rose high and  the season was fruitful because he had blessed their land.    Far down below him as he flew one day he saw something white on a  purple rock in the sea. It seemed too large to be a snowy-plumaged  bird, and he darted swiftly downward that he might see more clearly.  The spray lashed against the steep rocks of the desolate island, and  showered itself upon a figure that at first he took to be a statue of  white marble. The figure was but that of a girl, slight and very  youthful, yet more fair even than any of the nymphs of the Hesperides.  Invisible in his Helmet of Darkness, Perseus drew near, and saw that  the fragile white figure was shaken by shivering sobs. The waves,  every few moments, lapped up on her little cold white feet, and he saw  that heavy chains held her imprisoned to that chilly rock in the sea.  A great anger stirred the heart of Perseus, and swiftly he took the  helmet from his head and stood beside her. The maid gave a cry of  terror, but there was no evil thing in the face of Perseus. Naught but  strength and kindness and purity shone out of his steady eyes.    Thus when, very gently, he asked her what was the meaning of her cruel  imprisonment, she told him the piteous story, as a little child tells  the story of its grief to the mother who comforts it. Her mother was  queen of Ethiopia, she said, and very, very beautiful. But when the  queen had boasted that no nymph who played amongst the snow-crested  billows of the sea was as fair as she, a terrible punishment was sent  to her. All along the coast of her father's kingdom a loathsome  sea-monster came to hold its sway, and hideous were its ravages. Men  and women, children and animals, all were equally desirable food for  its insatiate maw, and the whole land of Ethiopia lay in mourning  because of it. At last her father, the king, had consulted an oracle  that he might find help to rid the land of the monster. And the oracle  had told him that only when his fair daughter, Andromeda, had been  sacrificed to the creature that scourged the sea-coast would the  country go free. Thus had she been brought there by her parents that  one life might be given for many, and that her mother's broken heart  might expiate her sin of vanity. Even as Andromeda spoke, the sea was  broken by the track of a creature that cleft the water as does the  forerunning gale of a mighty storm. And Andromeda gave a piteous cry.    \"Lo! he comes!\" she cried. \"Save me! ah, save me! I am so young to  die.\"    Then Perseus darted high above her and for an instant hung poised like  a hawk that is about to strike. Then, like the hawk that cannot miss  its prey, swiftly did he swoop down and smote with his sword the  devouring monster of the ocean. Not once, but again and again he  smote, until all the water round the rock was churned into slime and  blood-stained froth, and until his loathsome combatant floated on its  back, mere carrion for the scavengers of the sea.    Then Perseus hewed off the chains that held Andromeda, and in his arms  he held her tenderly as he flew with her to her father's land.    Who so grateful then as the king and queen of Ethiopia? and who so  happy as Andromeda? for Perseus, her deliverer, dearest and greatest  hero to her in all the world, not only had given her her freedom, but  had given her his heart.    Willingly and joyfully her father agreed to give her to Perseus for  his wife. No marriage feast so splendid had ever been held in Ethiopia  in the"]]]
