And, when a hundred years had fled,  Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said:  \"From thee, O Sagar, blameless King,  A mighty host of sons shall spring,  And thou shalt win a glorious name  Which none, O Chief, but thou shall claim.  One of thy queens a son shall bear,  Maintainer of thy race and heir;  And of the other there shall be  Sons sixty thousand born to thee.\"      Thus as he spake, with one accord,  To win the grace of that high lord,  The queens, with palms together laid,  In humble supplication prayed:  \"Which queen, O Brahman, of the pair,  The many, or the one shall bear?  Most eager, Lord, are we to know,  And as thou sayest be it so.\"  With his sweet speech the saint replied:  \"Yourselves, O Queens, the choice decide.  Your own discretion freely use  Which shall the one or many choose:  One shall the race and name uphold,  The host be famous, strong, and bold.  Which will have which?\" Then Kesini  The mother of one heir would be.  Sumati, sister of the king(181)  Of all the birds that ply the wing,  To that illustrious Brahman sued  That she might bear the multitude  Whose fame throughout the world should sound  For mighty enterprise renowned.  Around the saint the monarch went,  Bowing his head, most reverent.  Then with his wives, with willing feet,  Resought his own imperial seat.  Time passed. The elder consort bare  A son called Asamanj, the heir.  Then Sumati, the younger, gave  Birth to a gourd,(182) O hero brave,  Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,  Gave sixty thousand babes to view.  All these with care the nurses laid  In jars of oil; and there they stayed,  Till, youthful age and strength complete,  Forth speeding from each dark retreat,  All peers in valour, years, and might,  The sixty thousand came to light.  Prince Asamanj, brought up with care,  Scourge of his foes, was made the heir.  But liegemen's boys he used to cast  To Sarju's waves that hurried past,  Laughing the while in cruel glee  Their dying agonies to see.  This wicked prince who aye withstood  The counsel of the wise and good,  Who plagued the people in his hate,  His father banished from the state.  His son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,  Was Ansuman, beloved of all.      Long years flew by. The king decreed  To slay a sacrificial steed.  Consulting with his priestly band  He vowed the rite his soul had planned,  And, Veda skilled, by their advice  Made ready for the sacrifice.          Canto XL. The Cleaving Of The Earth.      The hermit ceased: the tale was done:  Then in a transport Raghu's son  Again addressed the ancient sire  Resplendent as a burning fire:  \"O holy man, I fain would hear  The tale repeated full and clear  How he from whom my sires descend  Brought the great rite to happy end.\"  The hermit answered with a smile:  \"Then listen, son of Raghu, while  My legendary tale proceeds  To tell of high-souled Sagar's deeds.  Within the spacious plain that lies  From where Himalaya's heights arise  To where proud Vindhya's rival chain  Looks down upon the subject plain--  A land the best for rites declared(183)--  His sacrifice the king prepared.  And Ansuman the prince--for so  Sagar advised--with ready bow  Was borne upon a mighty car  To watch the steed who roamed afar.  But Indra, monarch of the skies,  Veiling his form in demon guise,  Came down upon the appointed day  And drove the victim horse away.  Reft of the steed the priests, distressed,  The master of the rite addressed:  \"Upon the sacred day by force  A robber takes the victim horse.  Haste, King! now let the thief be slain;  Bring thou the charger back again:  The sacred rite prevented thus  Brings scathe and woe to all of us.  Rise, monarch, and provide with speed  That naught its happy course impede.\"      King Sagar in his crowded court  Gave ear unto the priests' report.  He summoned straightway to his side  His sixty thousand sons, and cried:  \"Brave sons of mine, I knew not how  These demons are so mighty now:  The priests began the rite so well  All sanctified with prayer and spell.  If in the depths of earth he hide,  Or lurk beneath the ocean's tide,  Pursue, dear sons, the robber's track;  Slay him and bring the charger back.  The whole of this broad earth explore,  Sea-garlanded, from shore to shore:  Yea, dig her up with might and main  Until you see the horse again.  Deep let your searching labour reach,  A league in depth dug out by each.  The robber of our horse pursue,  And please your sire who orders you.  My grandson, I, this priestly train,  Till the steed comes, will here remain.\"      Their eager hearts with transport burned  As to their task the heroes turned.  Obedient to their father, they  Through earth's recesses forced their way.  With iron arms' unflinching toil  Each dug a league beneath the soil.  Earth, cleft asunder, groaned in pain,  As emulous they plied amain  Sharp-pointed coulter, pick, and bar,  Hard as the bolts of Indra are.  Then loud the horrid clamour rose  Of monsters dying neath their blows,  Giant and demon, fiend and snake,  That in earth's core their dwelling make.  They dug, in ire that naught could stay,  Through sixty thousand leagues their way,  Cleaving the earth with matchless strength  Till hell itself they reached at length.  Thus digging searched they Jambudvip(184)  With all its hills and mountains steep.  Then a great fear began to shake  The heart of God, bard, fiend, and snake,  And all distressed in spirit went  Before the Sire Omnipotent.  With signs of woe in every face  They sought the mighty Father's grace,  And trembling still and ill at ease  Addressed their Lord in words like these:  \"The sons of Sagar, Sire benign,  Pierce the whole earth with mine on mine,  And as their ruthless work they ply  Innumerable creatures die.  \"This is the thief,\" the princes say,  \"Who stole our victim steed away.  This marred the rite, and caused us ill,  And so their guiltless blood they spill.\"          Canto XLI. Kapil.      The father lent a gracious ear  And listened to their tale of fear,  And kindly to the Gods replied  Whom woe and death had terrified:  \"The wisest Vasudeva,(185) who  The Immortals' foe, fierce Madhu, slew,  Regards broad Earth with love and pride  And guards, in Kapil's form, his bride.(186)  His kindled wrath will quickly fall  On the king's sons and burn them all.  This cleaving of the earth his eye  Foresaw in ages long gone by:  He knew with prescient soul the fate  That Sagar's children should await.\"      The Three-and-thirty,(187) freed from fear,  Sought their bright homes with hopeful cheer.  Still rose the great tempestuous sound  As Sagar's children pierced the ground.  When thus the whole broad earth was cleft,  And not a spot unsearched was left,  Back to their home the princes sped,  And thus unto their father said:  \"We searched the earth from side to side,  While countless hosts of creatures died.  Our conquering feet in triumph trod  On snake and demon, fiend and God;  But yet we failed, with all our toil,  To find the robber and the spoil.  What can we more? If more we can,  Devise, O King, and tell thy plan.\"      His children's speech King Sagar heard,  And answered thus, to anger stirred:  \"Dig on, and ne'er your labour stay  Till through earth's depths you force your way.  Then smite the robber dead, and bring  The charger back with triumphing.\"  The sixty thousand chiefs obeyed:  Deep through the earth their way they made.  Deep as they dug and deeper yet  The immortal elephant they met,  Famed Virupaksha(188) vast of size,  Upon whose head the broad earth lies:  The mighty beast who earth sustains  With shaggy hills and wooded plains.  When, with the changing moon, distressed,  And longing for a moment's rest,  His mighty head the monster shakes,  Earth to the bottom reels and quakes.  Around that warder strong and vast  With reverential steps they passed.  Nor, when the honour due was paid,  Their downward search through earth delayed.  But turning from the east aside  Southward again their task they plied.  There Mahapadma held his place,  The best of all his mighty race,  Like some huge hill, of monstrous girth,  Upholding on his head the earth.  When the vast beast the princes saw,  They marvelled and were filled with awe.  The sons of high-souled Sagar round  That elephant in reverence wound.  Then in the western region they  With might unwearied cleft their way.  There saw they with astonisht eyes  Saumanas, beast of mountain size.  Round him with circling steps they went  With greetings kind and reverent.      On, on--no thought of rest or stay--  They reached the seat of Soma's sway.  There saw they Bhadra, white as snow,  With lucky marks that fortune show,  Bearing the earth upon his head.  Round him they paced with solemn tread,  And honoured him with greetings kind,  Then downward yet their way they mined.  They gained the tract 'twixt east and north  Whose fame is ever blazoned forth,(189)  And by a storm of rage impelled,  Digging through earth their course they held.      Then all the princes, lofty-souled,  Of wondrous vigour, strong and bold,  Saw Vasudeva(190) standing there  In Kapil's form he loved to wear,  And near the everlasting God  The victim charger cropped the sod.  They saw with joy and eager eyes  The fancied robber and the prize,  And on him rushed the furious band  Crying aloud, Stand, villain! stand!  \"Avaunt! avaunt!\" great Kapil cried,  His bosom flusht with passion's tide;  Then by his might that proud array  All scorcht to heaps of ashes lay.(191)          Canto XLII. Sagar's Sacrifice.      Then to the prince his grandson, bright  With his own fame's unborrowed light,  King Sagar thus began to say,  Marvelling at his sons' delay:  \"Thou art a warrior skilled and bold,  Match for the mighty men of old.  Now follow on thine uncles' course  And track the robber of the horse.

I, for one, won't have anything to do with  her.\"    \"Nor I. I think it is time she should be taught her place. If we could  only manage to inflict some decided snub on her, she might take the  hint and give up trying to poke herself in where she doesn't belong.  The idea of her consenting to be elected on the freshmen executive!  But she seems impervious to snubs.\"    \"Edna, let's play a joke on her. It will serve her right. Let us send  an invitation in somebody's name to the senior 'prom.'\"    \"The very thing! And sign Sidney Hill's name to it. He's the  handsomest and richest fellows at Payzant, and belongs to one of the  best families in town, and he's awfully fastidious besides. No doubt  she will feel immensely flattered and, of course, she'll accept. Just  think how silly she'll feel when she finds out he never sent it. Let's  write it now, and send it at once. There is no time to lose, for the  'prom' is on Thursday night.\"    The freshmen co-eds at Payzant College did not like Grace Seeley--that  is to say, the majority of them. They were a decidedly snobbish class  that year. No one could deny that Grace was clever, but she was poor,  dressed very plainly--\"dowdily,\" the girls said--and \"roomed\" herself,  that phrase meaning that she rented a little unfurnished room and  cooked her own meals over an oil stove.    The \"senior prom,\" as it was called, was the annual reception which  the senior class gave in the middle of every autumn term. It was the  smartest and gayest of all the college functions, and a Payzant co-ed  who received an invitation to it counted herself fortunate. The senior  girls were included as a matter of course, but a junior, soph, or  freshie could not go unless one of the senior boys invited her.    Grace Seeley was studying Greek in her tiny room that afternoon when  the invitation was brought to her. It was scrupulously orthodox in  appearance and form, and Grace never doubted that it was genuine,  although she felt much surprised that Sidney Hill, the leader of his  class and the foremost figure in all college sports and societies,  should have asked her to go with him to the senior prom.    But she was girlishly pleased at the prospect. She was as fond of a  good time as any other girl, and she had secretly wished very much  that she could go to the brilliant and much talked about senior prom.    Grace was quite unaware of her own unpopularity among her class  co-eds, although she thought it was very hard to get acquainted with  them. Without any false pride herself, and of a frank, independent  nature, it never occurred to her that the other Payzant freshies could  look down on her because she was poor, or resent her presence among  them because she dressed plainly.    She straightway wrote a note of acceptance to Sidney Hill, and that  young man naturally felt much mystified when he opened and read it in  the college library next morning.    \"Grace Seeley,\" he pondered. \"That's the jolly girl with the brown  eyes that I met at the philomathic the other night. She thanks me for  my invitation to the senior prom, and accepts with pleasure. Why, I  certainly never invited her or anyone else to go with me to the senior  prom. There must be some mistake.\"    Grace passed him at this moment on her way to the Latin classroom. She  bowed and smiled in a friendly fashion and Sidney Hill felt decidedly  uncomfortable. What was he to do? He did not like to think of putting  Miss Seeley in a false position because somebody had sent her an  invitation in his name.    \"I suppose it is some cad who has a spite at me that has done it,\" he  reflected, \"but if so I'll spoil his game. I'll take Miss Seeley to  the prom as if I had never intended doing anything else. She shan't be  humiliated just because there is someone at Payzant who would stoop to  that sort of thing.\"    So he walked up the hall with Grace and expressed his pleasure at her  acceptance, and on the evening of the prom he sent her a bouquet of  white carnations, whose spicy fragrance reminded her of her own little  garden at home. Grace thought it extremely nice of him, and dressed in  a flutter of pleasant anticipation.    Her gown was a very simple one of sheer white organdie, and was the  only evening dress she had. She knew there would be many smarter  dresses at the reception, but the knowledge did not disturb her  sensible head in the least.    She fingered the dainty white frills lovingly as she remembered the  sunny summer days at home in the little sewing-room, where cherry  boughs poked their blossoms in at the window, when her mother and  sisters had helped her to make it, with laughing prophesies and  speculations as to its first appearance. Into seam and puff and frill  many girlish hopes and dreams had been sewn, and they all came back to  Grace as she put it on, and helped to surround her with an atmosphere  of happiness.    When she was ready she picked up her bouquet and looked herself over  in the mirror, from the top of her curly head to the tips of her  white shoes, with a little nod of satisfaction. Grace was not exactly  pretty, but she had such a bright, happy face and such merry brown  eyes and such a friendly smile that she was very pleasant to look  upon, and a great many people thought so that night.    Grace had never in all her life before had so good a time as she had  at that senior prom. The seniors were quick to discover her unaffected  originality and charm, and everywhere she went she was the centre of a  merry group. In short, Grace, as much to her own surprise as anyone's,  found herself a social success.    Presently Sidney brought his brother up to be introduced, and the  latter said:    \"Miss Seeley, will you excuse my asking if you have a brother or any  relative named Max Seeley?\"    Grace nodded. \"Oh, yes, my brother Max. He is a doctor out west.\"    \"I was sure of it,\" said Murray Hill triumphantly. \"You resemble him  so strongly. Please don't consider me as a stranger a minute longer,  for Max and I are like brothers. Indeed, I owe my life to him. Last  summer I was out there on a surveying expedition, and I took typhoid  in a little out-of-the-way place where good nursing was not to be had  for love or money. Your brother attended me and he managed to pull me  through. He never left me day or night until I was out of danger, and  he worked like a Trojan for me.\"    \"Dear old Max,\" said Grace, her brown eyes shining with pride and  pleasure. \"That is so like him. He is such a dear brother and I  haven't seen him for four years. To see somebody who knows him so well  is next best thing to seeing himself.\"    \"He is an awfully fine fellow,\" said Mr. Hill heartily, \"and I'm  delighted to have met the 'little sister' he used to talk so much  about. I want you to come ever and meet my mother and sister. They  have heard me talk so much about Max that they think almost as much  of him as I do, and they will be glad to meet his sister.\"    Mrs. Hill, a handsome, dignified lady who was one of the chaperones of  the prom, received Grace warmly, while Beatrice Hill, an extremely  pretty, smartly gowned girl, made her feel at home immediately.    \"You came with Sid, didn't you?\" she whispered. \"Sid is so sly--he  never tells us whom he is going to take anywhere. But when I saw you  come in with him I knew I was going to like you, you looked so jolly.  And you're really the sister of that splendid Dr. Seeley who saved  Murray's life last summer? And to think you've been at Payzant nearly  a whole term and we never knew it!\"    \"Well, how have you enjoyed our prom, Miss Seeley?\" asked Sid, as they  walked home together under the arching elms of the college campus.    \"Oh! it was splendid,\" said Grace enthusiastically. \"Everybody was so  nice. And then to meet someone who could tell me so much about Max! I  must write them home all about it before I sleep, just to calm my head  a bit. Mother and the girls will be so interested, and I must send Lou  and Mab a carnation apiece for their scrapbooks.\"    \"Give me one back, please,\" said Sid. And Grace with a little blush,  did so.    That night, while Grace was slipping the stems of her carnations and  putting them into water, three little bits of conversation were being  carried on which it is necessary to report in order to round up this  story neatly and properly, as all stories should be rounded up.    In the first place, Beatrice Hill was saying to Sidney, \"Oh, Sid, that  Miss Seeley you had at the prom is a lovely girl. I don't know when  I've met anyone I liked so much. She was so jolly and friendly and she  didn't put on learned airs at all, as so many of those Payzant girls  do. I asked her all about herself and she told me, and all about her  mother and sisters and home and the lovely times they had together,  and how hard they worked to send her to college too, and how she  taught school in vacations and 'roomed' herself to help along. Isn't  it so brave and plucky of her! I know we are going to be great  friends.\"    \"I hope so,\" said Sidney briefly, \"because I have an idea that she and  I are going to be very good friends too.\"    And Sidney went upstairs and put away a single white carnation very  carefully.    In the second place, Mrs. Hill was saying to her eldest son, \"I liked  that Miss Seeley very much. She seemed a very sweet girl.\"    And, finally, Agnes Walters and Edna Hayden were discussing the matter  in great mystification in their room.    \"I can't understand it at all,\" said Agnes slowly. \"Sid Hill took her  to the prom and he must have sent her those carnations too. She could  never have afforded them herself. And did you see the fuss his people  made over her? I heard Beatrice telling her that she"]]]
