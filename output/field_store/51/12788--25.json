From what we have said it will be  seen that guild life, like the life of the town as a whole, was  essentially a social life. It was a larger family, into which various  blood families were merged. The interest of each was felt to be the  interest of all, and the interest of all no less the interest of each.    But in many towns, outside the town population properly speaking,  outside the patrician families who generally governed the Rath,  outside the guilds, outside the city organization altogether, there  were other bodies dwelling within the walls and forming _imperia in  imperiis_. These were the religious corporations, whose possessions  were often extensive, and who, dwelling within their own walls, shut  out from the rest of the town, were subject only to their own  ordinances. The quasi-religious, quasi-military Order of the Teutonic  Knights (_Deutscher Orden_), founded at the time of the Crusades, was  the wealthiest and largest of these corporations. In addition to the  extensive territories which it held in various parts of the empire, it  had establishments in a large number of cities. Besides this there  were, of course, the Orders of the Augustinians and Carthusians, and a  number of less important foundations, who had their cloisters in  various towns. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the pomp,  pride, and licentiousness of the Teutonic Order drew upon it the  especial hatred of the townsfolk; and amid the general wreck of  religious houses none were more ferociously despoiled than those  belonging to this Order. There were, moreover, in some towns, the  establishments of princely families, which were regarded by the  citizens with little less hostility than that accorded to the  religious Orders.    Such were the explosive elements of town life when changing conditions  were tending to dislocate the whole structure of mediaeval existence.  The capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 had struck a heavy  blow at the commerce of the Bavarian cities which had come by way of  Constantinople and Venice. This latter city lost one by one its  trading centres in the East, and all Oriental traffic by way of the  Black Sea was practically stopped. It was the Dutch cities which  inherited the wealth and influence of the German towns when Vasco da  Gama's discovery of the Cape route to the East began to have its  influence on the trade of the world. This diversion of Oriental  traffic from the old overland route was the starting-point of the  modern merchant navy, and it must be placed amongst the most potent  causes of the break-up of mediaeval civilization. The above change,  although immediately felt by the German towns, was not realized by  them in its full importance either as to its causes or its  consequences for more than a century; but the decline of their  prosperity was nevertheless sensible, even now, and contributed  directly to the coming upheaval.    The impatience of the prince, the prelate, the noble, and the wealthy  burgher at the restraints which the system of the Middle Ages placed  upon his activity as an individual in the acquisition for his own  behoof, and the disposal at his own pleasure, of wealth, regardless of  the consequences to his neighbour, found expression, and a powerful  lever, in the introduction from Italy of the Roman law in place of the  old canon and customary law of Europe. The latter never regarded the  individual as an independent and autonomous entity, but invariably  treated him with reference to a group or social body, of which he  might be the head or merely a subordinate member; but in any case the  filaments of custom and religious duty attached him to a certain  humanity outside himself, whether it were a village community, a  guild, a township, a province, or the empire. The idea of a right to  individual autonomy in his dealings with men never entered into the  mediaeval man's conception. Hence the mere possession of property was  not recognized by mediaeval law as conferring any absolute rights in  its holder to its unregulated use, and the basis of the mediaeval  notions of property was the association of responsibility and duty  with ownership. In other words, the notion of _trust_ was never  completely divorced from that of _possession_.    The Roman law rested on a totally different basis. It represented the  legal ethics of a society on most of its sides brutally and crassly  individualistic. That that society had come to an end instead of  evolving to its natural conclusion--a developed capitalistic  individualism such as exists to-day--was due to the weakness of its  economic basis, owing to the limitation at that time of man's power  over Nature, which deprived it of recuperative and defensive force,  thereby leaving it a prey not only to internal influences of decay but  also to violent destructive forces from without. Nevertheless, it left  a legacy of a ready-made legal system to serve as an implement for the  first occasion when economic conditions should be once more ready for  progress to resume the course of individualistic development, abruptly  brought to an end by the fall of ancient civilization as crystallized  in the Roman Empire.    The popular courts of the village, of the mark, and of the town, which  had existed up to the beginning of the sixteenth century with all  their ancient functions, were extremely democratic in character. Cases  were decided on their merits, in accordance with local custom, by a  body of jurymen chosen from among the freemen of the district, to whom  the presiding functionaries, most of whom were also of popular  selection, were little more than assessors. The technicalities of a  cut-and-dried system were unknown. The Catholic-Germanic theory of the  Middle Ages proper, as regards the civil power in all its functions,  from the highest downward, was that of the mere administrator of  justice as such; whereas the Roman law regarded the magistrate as the  vicegerent of the _princeps_ or _imperator_, in whose person was  absolutely vested as its supreme embodiment the whole power of the  State. The Divinity of the Emperors was a recognition of this fact;  and the influence of the Roman law revived the theory as far as  possible under the changed conditions, in the form of the doctrine of  the Divine Right of Kings--a doctrine which was totally alien to the  Catholic feudal conception of the Middle Ages. This doctrine,  moreover, received added force from the Oriental conception of the  position of the ruler found in the Old Testament, from which  Protestantism drew so much of its inspiration.    But apart from this aspect of the question, the new juridical  conception involved that of a system of rules as the crystallized  embodiment of the abstract \"State,\" given through its representatives,  which could under no circumstances be departed from, and which could  only be modified in their operation by legal quibbles that left to  them their nominal integrity. The new law could therefore only be  administered by a class of men trained specially for the purpose, of  which the plastic customary law borne down the stream of history from  primitive times, and insensibly adapting itself to new conditions but  understood in its broader aspects by all those who might be called to  administer it, had little need. The Roman law, the study of which was  started at Bologna in the twelfth century, as might naturally be  expected, early attracted the attention of the German Emperors as a  suitable instrument for use on emergencies. But it made little real  headway in Germany itself as against the early institutions until the  fifteenth century, when the provincial power of the princes of the  empire was beginning to overshadow the central authority of the  titular chief of the Holy Roman Empire. The former, while strenuously  resisting the results of its application from above, found in it a  powerful auxiliary in their Courts in riveting their power over the  estates subject to them. As opposed to the delicately adjusted  hierarchical notions of Feudalism, which did not recognize any  absoluteness of dominion either over persons or things, in short for  which neither the head of the State had any inviolate authority as  such, nor private property any inviolable rights or sanctity as such,  the new jurisprudence made corner-stones of both these conceptions.    Even the canon law, consisting in a mass of Papal decretals dating  from the early Middle Ages, and which, while undoubtedly containing  considerable traces of the influence of Roman law, was nevertheless  largely customary in its character, with an infusion of Christian  ethics, had to yield to the new jurisprudence, and that too in  countries where the Reformation had been unable to replace the old  ecclesiastical dogma and organization. The principles and practice of  the Roman law were sedulously inculcated by the tribe of civilian  lawyers who by the beginning of the sixteenth century infested every  Court throughout Europe. Every potentate, great and small, little as  he might like its application by his feudal overlord to himself, was  yet only too ready and willing to invoke its aid for the oppression of  his own vassals or peasants. Thus the civil law everywhere triumphed.  It became the juridical expression of the political, economical, and  religious change which marks the close of the Middle Ages and the  beginnings of the modern commercial world.    It must not be supposed, however, that no resistance was made to it.  Everywhere in contemporary literature, side by side with denunciations  of the new mercenary troops, the _Landsknechte_, we find  uncomplimentary allusions to the race of advocates, notaries, and  procurators who, as one writer has it, \"are increasing like  grasshoppers in town and in country year by year.\" Whenever they  appeared, we are told, countless litigious disputes sprang"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#19)"],[1," century. During a  luncheon at the Cafe Stanislaus an impassioned address was made by the  prefect.    We left Nancy at 2 P. M. for Chalons on the Marne, one of the three  important military supply centers of France. En-route we passed a number  of ruined villages with scarcely a house left and with but few  inhabitants. We passed through Bar Le Duc also, another distributing  center. On this memorable part of the journey we skirted three battle  fronts, Verdun, Somme and the Marne. We noticed numerous trench soldiers  in squads, enroute to and from the trenches.    The discipline of the French army is very much different from that of  the English and Germans. The officers and the French soldiers are  comrades. The German and French soldiers have no tents, they sleep in  their overcoats. I expected that when we got into the war zone we would  see tents everywhere, but there was not a tent in sight.    The distance from Nancy to Chalons on the Marne is 108 miles. All this  distance we travelled close in the rear of the French army and much of  it near the German army. In the early part of the year this ground was  occupied by the Germans, being afterwards retaken by the French. We were  closest to the trenches when passing St. Miheil, where the famous German  salient was still held.    We reached Chalons on the Marne at 10 o'clock on the evening of October  8th, after a busy and most interesting day. We were quartered here for  the night and remained part of the next morning. During our stay we  could hear the booming of guns continuously, and saw many evidences of  military occupation. At this time the Germans had been forced back about  thirty miles from Chalons on the Marne, and their shells were no longer  feared in this immediate vicinity. The cannon we heard along the greater  portion of the route after passing Bar Le Duc must have been French  guns, although the German big guns can be heard for fifty miles under  favorable circumstances.    At Chalons on the Marne an incident occurred which made a deep  impression on me, although it was in itself simple enough. It was my  custom to go about much seeking to see whatever was to be seen at all of  our stops. Usually I had a companion, but sometimes went alone. On this  occasion Mr. Warren, of the Commission, was with me. We had entered the  Cathedral of Notre Dame, to inspect its interior and arrived just as a  funeral service was ending. It was one of those pathetic funerals, now  common enough in France, at which the body is not present, in this case  being that of a young man killed in the army and evidently an only son.    The services ended with a procession around the church and this brought  the mourners to where we were. We fell in with them, this being our  natural impulse and also, we believed, the proper and courteous thing to  do, rather than to rudely retire. When the party reached the main aisle,  the friends gathered around the father and mother and two daughters,  weeping with them and kissing them in the demonstrative way the French  have of showing both grief and affection. Before we knew just what to  do, the mourners melted away, taking with them the mother and daughters.  Mr. Warren also had disappeared and I was left practically alone with  the father of the dead boy. He approached me and extended his hand,  having perhaps read in my face something of my feelings. He knew no  English and I knew no French, but the language of human sympathy is  universal. We grasped hands and the only word uttered was my crude  \"Americaine.\" None other was needed. I could tell by the pressure of the  hand holding mine that my sympathy was appreciated, even though I was  from across the seas and an utter stranger, and any doubts I had felt  about the propriety of remaining were thoroughly dispelled.    [Illustration: German Trenches Captured by the French.]    Funerals such as this are very frequent in France. Scarcely a family but  has suffered its loss, and in some cases several sons have been taken  from one home. Among the hundreds of personal cards brought back with me  from France, an astonishing number are bordered deeply with black. These  are the cards of the most prominent people in the places we visited, the  members of the Commission having met few others, and the mourning border  on so many of them shows that in France as well as in England, the upper  classes have borne their full share of the terrific toll levied by the  war.    Before leaving Chalons on the Marne we visited the canal, the banks of  which were lined with flowers and ivy. We crossed here a bridge built in  the Seventeenth century and still in good condition.          XV.    REIMS AND THE TRENCHES      Some time during the forenoon of the day following our arrival at  Chalons on the Marne we left in the military automobiles for Reims. This  city is on the south branch of the river Aisne, on which the Germans  made their stand after the battle of the Marne, and had been within  reach of their guns constantly since they stopped retreating after that  battle. It is about ninety miles from Paris. The city was at that time  less than two miles from the actual battle line, trenches extending  close up to its edges. The Germans were very busy and there was abundant  evidence of the fact in the sound of cannon. It was here that we were to  be allowed a visit to the trenches.    On the way we passed a large number of Hindu-Chinese and Russian  soldiers. We saw two captive balloons, used by the French to direct  artillery fire on their enemies. Thousands of soldiers were coming and  going between the trenches and the encampments behind.    On this trip we passed through and stopped briefly at an aviation camp,  where the aviators were tending their machines and waiting to be called  for duty in the air. A short stop was also made at a large encampment,  where there must have been at least twenty thousand French soldiers.  This was the largest number we saw at any one time. Here we were shown  concealed trenches and batteries so skillfully hidden that they could  not be seen until you were right upon the guns. We also saw on this ride  several illustrations of how bridges and other military works can be  hidden from aviators by painted scenery and the use of trees. By 11 A.M.  of this day we had come within five miles of the German trenches, behind  which, we were told, were more two million German soldiers and across  from them at least an equal number of French. Of this vast number of  warriors we saw at no time more than twenty thousand. Many were in the  trenches and others in encampments on both sides, within easy reach of  the lines but secure from gun fire.    We came to the top of a ridge near Reims, and just before reaching the  summit orders were given by the sentinels to separate the automobiles  and run them half a mile apart, as they would be within range of German  guns and might draw the fire if seen in a company. At this point two  members of the Commission suddenly lost their interest in the scenes  ahead and refused to go any further. From this time until we entered  Reims, batteries, many of them concealed, with other signs of real war,  became more numerous.    [Illustration: The Reims Cathedral Before Its Destruction.]    At 11:30 A. M. we entered the famous Champagne district, known all over  the world as the locality where grapes for making champagne can be  raised better than anywhere else. We saw here farmers and women working  in the fields and vineyards within a mile of the actual front. They were  within range of German guns and in great danger, but they worked on,  seemingly careless of the fact.    We passed many \"dugouts\" occupied by soldiers, and saw soldiers digging  trenches. All the time the guns were roaring, apparently just beyond the  city of Reims. This ground had all been at one time in the hands of the  Germans.    We reached Reims at noon and were taken direct to the City Club. Here  the Commission was entertained by Robert Lewthwaite, the head of the  great wine firm of Heidsick & Company. At this luncheon we met Col.  Tautot, chief of staff under General Lanquelot, commander in the Reims  sector. Col. Tautot represented his superior, who could not be present,  probably because of more important engagements with the Germans. We also  met Captain Talamon, a staff officer, and Jacques Regnier, sub-prefect  of the Reims district. Col. Tautot had been invested with the ribbon of  the Legion of Honor and within a week of our visit had been in active  service. Out of fifteen members originally on the staff, he alone  survived, all the others having been killed in action or died of wounds.    In the room where luncheon was served at the City Club was a great hole,  made through the wall by a shell and not yet closed. We were told that  this shell had arrived a few days before our visit. This was quite  appetizing information, but our hosts assured us that we were  comparatively safe, as there had been no firing for some time. I took  their word for it and enjoyed the luncheon after the long and keenly  interesting ride. At this luncheon a curious toast was offered by the  host--\"I looks toward you.\" The proper response was--\"I likewise bows.\"    After the luncheon Colonel Tautot and the sub-prefect led the Commission  to inspect the ruined cathedral. This was a pitiful and fascinating  sight. This once famous cathedral is practically a wreck. I doubt very  much if it can ever be restored. We were taken into the interior and  were shown how wonderful stained glass windows had been blown out. We  picked up a number of the pieces of fine glass from the ground. The  making of this glass is a lost art and the coloring is most beautiful. I  brought home some of the glass and had it used as settings for a number  of rings which I presented to friends. The sub-prefect presented me, as  a relic, a bone--the front part of a forearm. This cathedral was the"]]]
