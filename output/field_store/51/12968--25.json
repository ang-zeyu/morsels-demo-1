Yu ain't got no reason to look fer  a rush. This camp is half white men an' half bullies, an' th' white men  won't stand fer no play like that. Them fellers that jest passed are  neighbors of yourn, an' they won't lay abed if yu needs them. But yu  wants to look out fer th' joints in th' town. Guess this business is out  of yore line,\" he finished as he sized Hopalong up.    \"She shore is, but I'm here to stay. Got tired of punchin' an' reckoned  I'd get rich.\" Here he smiled and glanced at the hole. \"How're yu makin'  out?\" He asked.    \"'Bout five dollars a day apiece, but that ain't nothin' when grub's so  high. Got reckless th' other day an' had a egg at fifty cents.\"    Hopalong whistled and glanced at the empty cans at his feet. \"Any  marshal in this burg?\"    \"Yep. But he's one of th' gang. No good, an' drunk half th' time an'  half drunk th' rest. Better come down an' have something,\" invited the  miner.    \"I'd shore like to, but I can't let no gang get in that door,\" replied  the puncher.    \"Oh, that's all right; I'll call my pardner down to keep house till yu  gits back. He can hold her all right. Hey, Jake!\" he called to a man who  was some hundred paces distant; \"Come down here an' keep house till we  gits back, will yu?\"    The man lumbered down to them and took possession as Hopalong and his  newly found friend started for the town.    They entered the \"Miner's Rest\" and Hopalong fixed the room in his mind  with one swift glance. Three men--and they looked like the crowd he had  stopped before--were playing poker at a table near the window. Hopalong  leaned with his back to the bar and talked, with the players always in  sight.    Soon the door opened and a bewhiskered, heavy-set man tramped in, and  walking up to Hopalong, looked him over.    \"Huh,\" he sneered, \"Yu are th' gent with th' festive guns that plugged  Dan, ain't yu?\"    Hopalong looked at him in the eyes and quietly replied:    \"An' who th' deuce are yu?\"    The stranger's eyes blazed and his face wrinkled with rage as he  aggressively shoved his jaw close to Hopalong's face.    \"Yu runt, I'm a better man than yu even if yu do wear hair pants,\"  referring to Hopalong's chaps. \"Yu cow-wrastlers make me tired, an' I'm  goin' to show yu that this town is too good for you. Yu can say it right  now that yu are a ornery, game-leg--\"    Hopalong smashed his insulter squarely between the eyes with all the  power of his sinewy body behind the blow, knocking him in a heap under  the table. Then he quickly glanced at the card players and saw a hostile  movement. His gun was out in a flash and he covered the trio as he  walked up to them. Never in all his life had he felt such a desire to  kill. His eyes were diamond points of accumulated fury, and those whom  he faced quailed before him.    \"Yu scum! Draw, please draw! Pull yore guns an' gimme my chance! Three  to one, an' I'll lay my guns here,\" he said, placing them on the bar and  removing his hands. \"'Nearer My God to Thee' is purty appropriate fer  yu just now! Yu seem to be a-scared of yore own guns. Git down on yore  dirty knees an' say good an' loud that yu eats dirt! Shout out that  yu are too currish to live with decent men,\" he said, even-toned and  distinct, his voice vibrant with passion as he took up his Colts. \"Get  down!\" he repeated, shoving the weapons forward and pulling back the  hammers.    The trio glanced at each other, and all three dropped to their knees and  repeated in venomous hatred the words Hopalong said for them.    \"Now git! An' if I sees yu when I leaves I'll send yu after yore friend.  I'll shoot on sight now. Git!\" He escorted them to the door and kicked  the last one out.    His miner friend still leaned against the bar and looked his approval.    \"Well done, youngster! But yu wants to look out--that man,\" pointing to  the now groping victim of Hopalong's blow, \"is th' marshal of this town.  He or his pals will get yu if yu don't watch th' corners.\"    Hopalong walked over to the marshal, jerked him to his feet and slammed  him against the bar. Then he tore the cheap badge from its place and  threw it on the floor. Reaching down, he drew the marshal's revolver  from its holster and shoved it in its owner's hand.    \"Yore th' marshal of this place an' it's too good for me, but yore gain'  to pick up that tin lie,\" pointing at the badge, \"an' yore goin' to do  it right now. Then yore gain' to get kicked out of that door, an' if  yu stops runnin' while I can see yu I'll fill yu so full of holes yu'll  catch cold. Yore a sumptious marshal, yu are! Yore th' snortingest ki-yi  that ever stuck its tail atween its laigs, yu are. Yu pop-eyed wall  flower, yu wants to peep to yoreself or some papoose'll slide yu over  th' Divide so fast yu won't have time to grease yore pants. Pick up that  license-tag an' let me see you perculate so lively that yore back'll  look like a ten-cent piece in five seconds. Flit!\"    The marshal, dazed and bewildered, stooped and fumbled for the badge.  Then he stood up and glanced at the gun in his hand and at the eager man  before him. He slid the weapon in his belt and drew his hand across his  fast-closing eyes. Cursing streaks of profanity, he staggered to the  door and landed in a heap in the street from the force of Hopalong's  kick. Struggling to his feet, he ran unsteadily down the block and  disappeared around a corner.    The bartender, cool and unperturbed, pushed out three glasses on his  treat: \"I've seen yu afore, up in Cheyenne--'member? How's yore friend  Red?\" He asked as he filled the glasses with the best the house  afforded.    \"Well, shore 'nuff! Glad to see yu, Jimmy! What yu doin' away off here?\"  Asked Hopalong, beginning to feel at home.    \"Oh, jest filterin' round like. I'm awful glad to see yu--this yere wart  of a town needs siftin' out. It was only last week I was wishin' one of  yore bunch 'ud show up--that ornament yu jest buffaloed shore raised th'  devil in here, an' I wished I had somebody to prospect his anatomy for a  lead mine. But he's got a tough gang circulating with him. Ever hear of  Dutch Shannon or Blinky Neary? They's with him.\"    \"Dutch Shannon? Nope,\" he replied.    \"Bad eggs, an' not a-carin' how they gits square. Th' feller yu' salted  yesterday was a bosom friend of th' marshal's, an' he passed in his  chips last night.\"    \"So?\"    \"Yep. Bought a bottle of ready-made nerve an' went to his own funeral.  Aristotle Smith was lookin' fer him up in Cheyenne last year. Aristotle  said he'd give a century fer five minutes' palaver with him, but he  shied th' town an' didn't come back. Yu know Aristotle, don't yu? He's  th' geezer that made fame up to Poison Knob three years ago. He used to  go to town ridin' astride a log on th' lumber flume. Made four miles in  six minutes with th' promise of a ruction when he stopped. Once when  he was loaded he tried to ride back th' same way he came, an' th'  first thing he knowed he was three miles farther from his supper an'  a-slippin' down that valley like he wanted to go somewhere. He swum out  at Potter's Dam an' it took him a day to walk back. But he didn't make  that play again, because he was frequently sober, an' when he wasn't  he'd only stand off an' swear at th' slide.\"    \"That's Aristotle, all hunk. He's th' chap that used to play checkers  with Deacon Rawlins. They used empty an' loaded shells for men, an' when  they got a king they'd lay one on its side. Sometimes they'd jar th'  board an' they'd all be kings an' then they'd have a cussin' match,\"  replied Hopalong, once more restored to good humor.    \"Why,\" responded Jimmy, \"he counted his wealth over twice by mistake an'  shore raised a howl when he went to blow it--thought he's been robbed,  an' laid behind th' houses fer a week lookin' fer th' feller that done  it.\"    \"I've heard of that cuss--he shore was th' limit. What become of him?\"  Asked the miner.    \"He ambled up to Laramie an' stuck his head in th' window of that joint  by th' plaza an' hollered 'Fire,' an' they did. He was shore a good  feller, all th' same,\" answered the bartender. Hopalong laughed and  started for the door. Turning around he looked at his miner friend and  asked: \"Comin' along? I'm goin' back now.\"    \"Nope. Reckon I'll hit th' tiger a whirl. I'll stop in when I passes.\"    \"All right. So long,\" replied Hopalong, slipping out of the door and  watching for trouble. There was no opposition shown him, and he arrived  at his claim to find Jake in a heated argument with another of the gang.    \"Here he comes now,\" he said as Hopalong walked up. \"Tell him what yu  said to me.\"    \"I said yu made a mistake,\" said the other, turning to the cowboy in a  half apologetic manner.    \"An' what else?\" Insisted Jake.    \"Why, ain't that all?\" Asked the claim-jumper's friend in feigned  surprise, wishing that he had kept quiet.    \"Well I reckons it is if yu can't back up yore words,\" responded Jake in  open contempt.    Hopalong grabbed the intruder by the collar of his shirt and hauled him  off the claim. \"Yu keep off this, understand? I just kicked yore marshal  out in th' street, an' I'll pay yu th' next call. If yu rambles in range  of my guns yu'll shore get in th' way of a slug. Yu an' yore gang wants  to browse on th' far side of th' range or yu'll miss a sunrise some  mornin'. Scoot!\"    Hopalong turned to his companion and smiled. \"What'd he say?\" He asked  genially.    \"Oh, he jest shot off his mouth a little. They's all no good. I've  collided with lots of them all over this country. They can't face a good  man an' keep their nerve. What'd yu say to th' marshal?\"    \"I told him what he was an' threw him outen th' street,\" replied  Hopalong. \"In about two weeks we'll have a new marshal an' he'll shore  be a dandy.\"    \"Yes? Why don't yu take th' job yoreself? We're with yu.\"    \"Better man comin'.

And thus the unwilling couple were united by the  Archbishop of York, who had come to attend the Parliament.    Never was there so sad a wedding! The people murmured greatly at this  unequal union, and pitied the poor princess, thus driven to wed a man  of low birth; and Goldborough herself wept pitifully, but resigned  herself to God's will. All men now acknowledged with grief that she  and her husband could have no claim to the English throne, and thus  Godrich seemed to have gained his object. Havelok and his unwilling  bride recognised that they would not be safe near Godrich, and as  Havelok had no home in Lincoln to which he could take the princess, he  determined to go back to his faithful foster-father, Grim, and put the  fair young bride under his loyal protection. Sorrowfully, with grief  and shame in their hearts, Havelok and Goldborough made their way on  foot to Grimsby, only to find the loyal Grim dead; but his five  children were alive and in prosperity. When they saw Havelok and his  wife they fell on their knees and saluted them with all respect and  reverence. In their joy to see their king again, these worthy  fisherfolk forgot their newly won wealth, and said: \"Welcome, dear  lord, and thy fair lady! What joy is ours to see thee again, for thy  subjects are we, and thou canst do with us as thou wilt. All that we  have is thine, and if thou wilt dwell with us we will serve thee and  thy wife truly in all ways!\" This greeting surprised Goldborough, who  began to suspect some mystery, and she was greatly comforted when  brothers and sisters busied themselves in lighting fires, cooking  meals, and waiting on her hand and foot, as if she had been indeed a  king's wife. Havelok, however, said nothing to explain the mystery,  and Goldborough that night lay awake bewailing her fate as a thrall's  bride, even though he was the fairest man in England.      The Revelation and Return to Denmark    As Goldborough lay sleepless and unhappy she became aware of a  brilliant light shining around Havelok and streaming from his mouth;  and while she feared and wondered an angelic voice cried to her:        \"Fair Princess, cease this grief and heavy moan!      For Havelok, thy newly wedded spouse,      Is son and heir to famous kings: the sign      Thou findest in the cross of ruddy gold      That shineth on his shoulder. He shall be      Monarch and ruler of two mighty realms;      Denmark and England shall obey his rule,      And he shall sway them with a sure command.      This shalt thou see with thine own eyes, and be      Lady and Queen, with Havelok, o'er these lands.\"    This angelic message so gladdened Goldborough that she kissed, for the  first time, her unconscious husband, who started up from his sleep,  saying, \"Dear love, sleepest thou? I have had a wondrous dream. I  thought I sat on a lofty hill, and saw all Denmark before me. As I  stretched out my arms I embraced it all, and the people clung to my  arms, and the castles fell at my feet; then I flew over the salt sea  with the Danish people clinging to me, and I closed all fair England  in my hand, and gave it to thee, dear love! Now what can this mean?\"    Goldborough answered joyfully: \"It means, dear heart, that thou shalt  be King of Denmark and of England too: all these realms shall fall  into thy power, and thou shalt be ruler in Denmark within one year.  Now do thou follow my advice, and let us go to Denmark, taking with us  Grim's three sons, who will accompany thee for love and loyalty; and  have no fear, for I know thou wilt succeed.\"    The next morning Havelok went to church early, and prayed humbly and  heartily for success in his enterprise and retribution on the false  traitor Godard; then, laying his offering on the altar before the  Cross, he went away glad in heart. Grim's three sons, Robert the Red,  William Wendut, and Hugh the Raven, joyfully consented to go with  Havelok to Denmark, to attack with all their power the false Jarl  Godard and to win the kingdom for the rightful heir. Their wives and  families stayed in England, but Goldborough would not leave her  husband, and after a short voyage the party landed safely on the  shores of Denmark, in the lands of Jarl Ubbe, an old friend of King  Birkabeyn, who lived far from the court now that a usurper held sway  in Denmark.      Havelok and Ubbe    Havelok dared not reveal himself and his errand until he knew more of  the state of parties in the country, and he therefore only begged  permission to live and trade there, giving Ubbe, as a token of  goodwill and a tribute to his power, a valuable ring, which the jarl  prized greatly. Ubbe, gazing at the so-called merchant's great stature  and beauty, lamented that he was not of noble birth, and planned to  persuade him to take up the profession of arms. At first, however, he  simply granted Havelok permission to trade, and invited him and  Goldborough to a feast, promising them safety and honour under his  protection. Havelok dreaded lest his wife's beauty might place them in  jeopardy, but he dared not refuse the invitation, which was pointedly  given to both; accordingly, when they went to Ubbe's hall, Goldborough  was escorted by Robert the Red and William Wendut.    Ubbe received them with all honour, and all men marvelled at  Goldborough's beauty, and Ubbe's wife loved Goldborough at first sight  as her husband did Havelok, so that the feast passed off with all joy  and mirth, and none dared raise a hand or lift his voice against the  wandering merchant whom Ubbe so strangely favoured. But Ubbe knew that  when once Havelok and his wife were away from his protection there  would be little safety for them, since the rough Danish nobles would  think nothing of stealing a trader's fair wife, and many a man had  cast longing eyes on Goldborough's loveliness. Therefore when the  feast was over, and Havelok took his leave, Ubbe sent with him a body  of ten knights and sixty men-at-arms, and recommended them to the  magistrate of the town, Bernard Brown, a true and upright man, bidding  him, as he prized his life, keep the strangers in safety and honour.  Well it was that Ubbe and Bernard Brown took these precautions, for  late at night a riotous crowd came to Bernard's house clamouring for  admittance. Bernard withstood the angry mob, armed with a great axe,  but they burst the door in by hurling a huge stone; and then Havelok  joined in the defence. He drew out the great beam which barred the  door, and crying, \"Come quickly to me, and you shall stay here! Curses  on him who flees!\" began to lay about him with the big beam, so that  three fell dead at once. A terrible fight followed, in which Havelok,  armed only with the beam, slew twenty men in armour, and was then sore  beset by the rest of the troop, aiming darts and arrows at his  unarmoured breast. It was going hardly with him, when Hugh the Raven,  hearing and understanding the cries of the assailants, called his  brothers to their lord's aid, and they all joined the fight so  furiously that, long ere day, of the sixty men who had attacked the  inn not one remained alive.    In the morning news was brought to Jarl Ubbe that his stranger  guest had slain sixty of the best of his soldiery.    \"What can this mean?\" said Ubbe. \"I had better go and see to it  myself, for any messenger would surely treat Havelok discourteously,  and I should be full loath to do that.\" He rode away to the house of  Bernard Brown, and asked the meaning of its damaged and battered  appearance.    \"My lord,\" answered Bernard Brown, \"last night at moonrise there came  a band of sixty thieves who would have plundered my house and bound me  hand and foot. When Havelok and his companions saw it they came to my  aid, with sticks and stones, and drove out the robbers like dogs from  a mill. Havelok himself slew three at one blow. Never have I seen a  warrior so good! He is worth a thousand in a fray. But alas! he is  grievously wounded, with three deadly gashes in side and arm and  thigh, and at least twenty smaller wounds. I am scarcely harmed at  all, but I fear he will die full soon.\"    Ubbe could scarcely believe so strange a tale, but all the bystanders  swore that Bernard told nothing but the bare truth, and that the whole  gang of thieves, with their leader, Griffin the Welshman, had been  slain by the hero and his small party. Then Ubbe bade them bring  Havelok, that he might call a leech to heal his wounds, for if the  stranger merchant should live Jarl Ubbe would without fail dub him  knight; and when the leech had seen the wounds he said the patient  would make a good and quick recovery. Then Ubbe offered Havelok and  his wife a dwelling in his own castle, under his own protection, till  Havelok's grievous wounds were healed. There, too, fair Goldborough  would be under the care of Ubbe's wife, who would cherish her as her  own daughter. This kind offer was accepted gladly, and they all went  to the castle, where a room was given them next to Ubbe's own.    At midnight Ubbe woke, aroused by a bright light in Havelok's room,  which was only separated from his own by a slight wooden partition. He  was vexed suspecting his guest of midnight wassailing, and went to  inquire what villainy might be hatching. To his surprise, both husband  and wife were sound asleep, but the light shone from Havelok's mouth,  and made a glory round his head. Utterly amazed at the marvel, Ubbe  went away silently, and returned with all the garrison of his castle  to the room where his guests still lay sleeping. As they gazed on the  light Havelok turned in his sleep, and they saw on his shoulder the  golden cross, shining like the sun, which all men knew to be the token  of royal birth. Then Ubbe exclaimed: \"Now I know who this is, and why  I loved him so dearly at first sight: this is the son of our dead King  Birkabeyn. Never was man so like another as this man is to the dead  king: he is his very"]]]
