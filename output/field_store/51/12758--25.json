Next he took out his purse, and  counted the money that had been given him by the lords and ladies of  the Earl's court. He found that in all he had five hundred crowns; so  he bought a horse, and took care to send back the one that he had  taken from the Earl's stable.    He then set off for Calais, crossed the Channel, landed safely at  Dover, and went on to London, where he soon made his way into genteel  company, and had once the honour to dance with the daughter of a Duke  at the Lord Mayor's ball. This sort of life, as anybody may well  think, soon made away with his little stock of money. When Fortunatus  found that he had not a penny left, he began to think of going back  again to France, and soon after went on board a ship bound to Picardy.  He landed in that country, but finding no employment he set off for  Brittany, when he lost his way in crossing a wood, and was forced to  stay in it all night. The next morning he was little better off, for  he could find no path. So he walked about from one part of the wood to  another, till at last, on the evening of the second day, he saw a  spring, at which he drank very heartily; but still he had nothing to  eat, and was ready to die with hunger. When night came on, he heard  the growling of wild beasts, so he climbed up a high tree for safety,  and he had hardly seated himself in it, before a lion walked fiercely  up to the spring to drink. This made him very much afraid. When the  lion had gone away, a bear came to drink also; and, as the moon shone  very bright, the beast looked up, and saw Fortunatus, and straightway  began to climb up the tree to get at him.    Fortunatus drew his sword, and sat quiet till the bear was come within  arm's length; and then he ran him through the body. This drove the  bear so very savage, that he made a great spring to get at him; but  the bough broke, and down he fell, and lay sprawling and howling on  the ground. Fortunatus now looked around on all sides; and as he saw  no more wild beasts near, he thought this would be a good time to get  rid of the bear at once; so down he came, and killed him at a single  blow. Being almost starved for want of food, the poor youth stooped  down, and was going to suck the blood of the bear; but looking round  once more, to see if any wild beasts were coming, he on a sudden  beheld a beautiful lady standing by his side, with a bandage over her  eyes, leaning upon a wheel, and looking as if she were going to speak,  which she soon did, in these words: \"Know, young man, that my name is  Fortune; I have the power to bestow wisdom, strength, riches, health,  beauty, and long life; one of these I am willing to grant you--choose  for yourself which it shall be.\"    Fortunatus was not a moment before he answered: \"Good lady, I wish to  have riches in such plenty that I may never again know what it is to  be so hungry as I now find myself.\" The lady then gave him a purse,  and told him that in all the countries where he might happen to be, he  need only put his hand into the purse as often as he pleased, and he  would be sure to find in it ten pieces of gold; that the purse should  never fail of yielding the same sum as long as it was kept by him and  his children; but that when he and his children should be dead, then  the purse would lose its power.    Fortunatus now did not know what to do with himself for joy, and began  to thank the lady very much; but she told him that he had better think  of making his way out of the wood. She then directed him which path to  take, and bade him farewell. He walked by the light of the moon, as  fast as his weakness and fatigue would let him, till he came near an  inn. But before he went into it, he thought it would be best to see  whether the Lady Fortune had been as good as her word; so he put his  hand into his purse, and to his great joy he counted ten pieces of  gold. Having nothing to fear, Fortunatus walked boldly up to the inn,  and called for the best supper they could get ready in a minute;  \"For,\" said he, \"I must wait till to-morrow before I am very nice. I  am so hungry now, that almost anything will do.\" Fortunatus very soon  ate quite enough, and then called for every sort of wine in the house,  and drank his fill. After supper, he began to think what sort of life  he should lead; \"For,\" said he to himself, \"I shall now have money  enough for everything I can desire.\" He slept that night in the very  best bed in the house, and the next day he ordered the finest victuals  of all kinds. When he rang his bell, all the waiters tried who should  run the fastest, to ask him what he pleased to want; and the landlord  himself, hearing what a noble guest was come to his house, took care  to be standing at the door to bow to him when he should be passing  out.    Fortunatus asked the landlord whether any fine horses could be got  near at hand; also, if he knew of some smart-looking, clever  men-servants who wanted places. By chance the landlord was able to  provide him with both. As he had now got everything he wanted, he set  out on the finest horse that was ever seen, with two servants, for the  nearest town. There he bought some grand suits of clothes, put his two  servants into liveries laced with gold, and they went on to Paris.  Here he took the best house that was to be had, and lived in great  pomp. He invited the nobility, and gave grand balls to all the most  beautiful ladies of the court. He went to all public places of  amusement, and the first lords in the country invited him to their  houses. He had lived in this manner for about a year, when he began to  think of going to Famagosta to visit his parents, whom he had left  very poor. \"But,\" thought Fortunatus, \"as I am young and have not seen  much of the world, I should like to meet with some person of more  knowledge than I have, who would make my journey both useful and  pleasing to me.\" Soon after this he met with an old gentleman, called  Loch-Fitty, who was a native of Scotland, and had left a wife and ten  children a great many years ago, in hopes to better his fortune; but  now, owing to many accidents, was poorer than ever, and had not money  enough to take him back to his family.    When Loch-Fitty found how much Fortunatus wished to obtain knowledge,  he told him many of the strange adventures he had met with, and gave  him an account of all the countries he had been in, as well as of the  customs, dress, and manners of the people. Fortunatus thought to  himself, \"This is the very man I stand in need of;\" so at once he made  him a good offer, which the old gentleman agreed to, but made the  bargain that he might first go and visit his family. Fortunatus told  him that he should. \"And,\" said he, \"as I am a little tired of being  always in the midst of such noisy pleasures as we find at Paris, I  will, with your leave, go with you to Scotland, and see your wife and  children.\" They get out the very next day, and came safe to the house  of Loch-Fitty; and in all the journey, Fortunatus did not once wish to  change his kind companion for all the pleasures and grandeur he had  left behind. Loch-Fitty kissed his wife and children, five of whom  were daughters, and the most beautiful creatures that were ever  beheld. When they were seated, his wife said to him, \"Ah! dear Lord  Loch-Fitty, how happy I am to see you once again! Now, I hope we shall  enjoy each other's company for the rest of our lives. What though we  are poor! We will be content if you will but promise not to think of  leaving us again to get riches, only because we have a noble title.\"    Fortunatus heard this with great surprise. \"What!\" said he, \"are you a  lord? Then you shall be a rich lord too. And that you may not think I  lay you under any burden in the fortune I shall give you, I will put  it in your power to make me your debtor instead. Give me your youngest  daughter, Cassandra, for a wife, and accompany us as far as Famagosta,  and take all your family with you, that you may have pleasant company  on your way back, when you have rested in that place from your  fatigue.\"    Lord Loch-Fitty shed some tears of joy to think he should at last see  his family again raised to all the honours which it had once enjoyed.  He gladly agreed to the marriage of Fortunatus with his daughter  Cassandra, and then told him the reasons that had forced him to drop  his title and live poor at Paris. When Lord Loch-Fitty had ended his  story, they agreed that the very next morning the Lady Cassandra  should be asked to accept the hand of Fortunatus; and that, if she  should consent, they would set sail in a few days for Famagosta. The  next morning the offer was made to her, as had been agreed on, and  Fortunatus had the pleasure of hearing from the lips of the beautiful  Cassandra, that the very first time she cast her eyes on him she  thought him the most handsome gentleman in the world.    Everything was soon ready for them to set out on the journey.  Fortunatus, Lord Loch-Fitty, his lady, and their ten children, then  set sail in a large ship: they had a good voyage, and landed safe at  the port of Famagosta. There, however, Fortunatus found, with great  grief and self-reproach, that his father and mother were both dead.  However, as he was an easy-tempered gentleman, and had his betrothed  Cassandra and her whole family to reconcile him to his grief, it did  not last very long; the wedding took place almost immediately; so they  lived all together in Famagosta, and in very great style. By the end  of the first year, the Lady Cassandra had a little son, who was  christened Ampedo; and the next year another, who was christened  Andolucia. For twelve years Fortunatus lived a very happy life with  his wife and children, and his wife's kindred; and as each of her  sisters had a fortune given her from the purse of Fortunatus, they  soon married very well.

In the fourteenth century single  figures under rich canopies are common, but we begin to lose sight of the  mosaic pattern as a back-ground. The stained glass in the windows of the  choir of Merton College Chapel, Oxford, is either very early in this, or  of a late period in the preceding century, and exhibits single figures  under rich canopies: over the head of one of these, (the kneeling figure  of a monk in his cowl,) is a scroll inscribed \"_Magister Henricus de  Mammesfeld me fecit_.\" In the windows of Tewkesbury Abbey Church are  several single figures of this period, some of knights in armour. In the  chancel of Stanford Church, Northamptonshire, are single figures of the  apostles in painted glass, each appearing within an ogee-headed canopy,  cinquefoiled within the head and crocketed externally, and the sides of  the canopy are flanked by pinnacled buttresses in stages. Specimens of  stained glass of the fifteenth century are numerous in comparison with  those of an earlier period; we find such in the east window of Langport  Church, Somersetshire, where single figures occur of St. Clemens, St.  Catherine, St. Elizabeth, and of many other saints. Some splendid remains  of painted glass of the fifteenth century are likewise preserved in the  windows of the choir of Ludlow Church, Salop, mostly in single figures;  amongst them is the representation of St. George in armour, of the reign  of Henry the Seventh; the figures of the Virgin and infant Christ may also  be noticed. Towards the close of this century kneeling figures, not  merely disposed single, but also in groups, formally arranged, may be  observed. As a composition, wherein a better display of grouping and  aerial perspective is evinced, the splendid window in St. Margaret's  Church, Westminster, of the crucifixion between the two thieves, and  numerous figures in the foreground, not grouped formally but with  artistical feeling, with the figures of St. George and St. Catherine on  each side of the principal design, and the portraits of Henry the Seventh  and his consort Elizabeth in separate compartments beneath, each kneeling  before a faldstool, may be noticed. This window, which in some of the  details exhibits an approach to the renaissance style, was presented to  Henry the Seventh by the magistrates of Dort in Holland, to adorn his  chapel at Westminster. The era of the various specimens of ancient stained  glass we meet with in our churches may generally be ascertained by the  costume and disposition of the figures, the form of the shields, the  mosaic pattern or other back-ground, and architectural designs of the  canopies.    The pavement beneath the high altar was frequently composed of small  square encaustic bricks or tiles, whereon the arms of founders and  benefactors, interspersed with figures, flowers, and emblematic devices,  were impressed, painted, and glazed; other parts of the church were also  paved with these tiles.    The walls of the church were covered with fresco paintings of the day of  judgment, legendary stories, portraits of saints, and scriptural,  allegorical, and historical subjects, in the conventional styles of the  different ages in which such were executed, the costume and details being  according to the fashion then prevailing. These paintings have in most  churches been obliterated by repeated coats of whitewash, so that few  perfect specimens now remain; traces of such are, however, occasionally  brought to light in the alteration and reparation of our ancient churches.  The subject of the judgment-day was commonly represented on the west wall  of the nave, or over the chancel arch; and in the contract for the  erection of the Lady Chapel, St. Mary's Church, Warwick, A. D. 1454, is a  covenant \"to paint fine and curiously, to make on the west wall the dome  of our Lord God Jesus, and all manner of devises and imagery thereto  belonging.\" The west front of the wall over the chancel arch, Trinity  Chapel, Stratford-upon-Avon, was some years back found to be thus covered;  but this painting, with others in the same chapel, was afterwards again  obliterated[199-*]. A curious fresco painting of the last judgment,  discovered a few years ago on the west face of the wall over the chancel  arch, Trinity Church, Coventry, has, however, been very carefully  preserved, and the coat of whitewash which tended to conceal it probably  ever since the Reformation has been judiciously removed. The legend of St.  Christopher, represented by a colossal figure with a beam-like  walking-staff, carrying the infant Christ on his shoulders through the  water, was generally painted on the north wall of the nave or body of the  church. A fresco painting of this subject, half obliterated, is still  apparent on the north wall of the nave of Burford Church, Oxfordshire; and  other instances might be adduced. The murder of Archbishop Becket was also  a very favourite subject: an early pictorial representation of the  thirteenth century, of this event, is still visible on one of the walls of  Preston Church, Sussex; it formed, likewise, one of the subjects  represented on the walls of Trinity Chapel, Stratford-upon-Avon; and a  painting of the same subject on panel, executed in the middle of the  fifteenth century, was formerly suspended over or near the tomb of Henry  the Fourth in Canterbury Cathedral[200-*]. Several vestiges of ancient  fresco wall-paintings, more or less obliterated, are still preserved in  Winchester Cathedral. The walls of our churches were even in the  Anglo-Saxon era embellished with paintings; and such are described as  decorating the walls of the church of Hexham in the seventh century. By  the synod of Calcuith, held A. D. 816, a representation of the saint to  whom a church was dedicated was required to be painted either on the wall  of the church or on a tablet suspended in the church.    [Illustration: Ancient Stone Reliquary or Shrine, Brixworth Church,  Northamptonshire.]    In most of the large conventual churches, and also in some of the smaller  parochial churches, shrines containing relics of the patron or other  saints were exhibited; these were either fixed and immovable, of  tabernacle-work, of stone or wood, or partly of both, or were small  movable feretories, which could be carried on festivals in procession. Of  the fixed shrines, that in Hereford Cathedral of Bishop Cantelupe, of the  date A. D. 1287, is a fine and early specimen, in very fair preservation.  In the north aisle of the abbey church, Shrewsbury, are some remains of a  stone shrine, which from the workmanship may be considered as a production  of the early part of the fifteenth century: this is much mutilated: but  the shrine of St. Frideswide, in Oxford Cathedral, the lower part of which  is composed of a stone tomb, the upper part of rich tabernacle-work of  wood, is still tolerably perfect: this is also of the fifteenth century.  Of the small movable feretories, one apparently of the workmanship of the  twelfth century, seven inches long and six high, formed of wood, enamelled  and gilt, with figures on the sides representing the crucifixion, is still  preserved in Shipley Church, Sussex; and a small stone reliquary or shrine  of the fourteenth century was discovered a few years ago, and is now  preserved in the church of Brixworth, Northamptonshire.    [Illustration: Ancient Organ.]    The organ, as a solemn musical instrument, may claim a very early origin,  and has been in use in our churches from the Anglo-Saxon era. The ancient  organs were small, and all the pipes were exposed. The phrase \"_a pair of  organs_,\" so frequently met with in old inventories and church accounts,  may probably have answered to the great and choir organ of a subsequent  period--one instrument in two divisions. The mechanism of the old organs  was rude and simple, compared with the improvements of modern times, and  the cost was small; they were generally placed in the rood-loft.    The church chest is often an ancient and interesting object: sometimes we  find it rudely formed, or hollowed out of the solid trunk of a tree, with  a plain or barrel-shaped lid of considerable thickness. The churches of  Bradford Abbas, Dorsetshire; Long Sutton, Somersetshire; and Ensham,  Oxfordshire; contain chests thus rudely constructed. Sometimes they are  strongly banded about with iron. The fronts and sides of these chests are  not unfrequently embellished more or less richly with carved tracery,  panel-work, and other detail in the style prevalent at the period of their  construction. In Clemping Church, Sussex, is an early chest of the  thirteenth century, the front of which exhibits a series of plain pointed  arches trefoiled in the head, and other carved work. In Haconby Church,  Lincolnshire, and in Chevington Church, Suffolk, are very rich chests  covered with tracery and detail in the decorated style of the fourteenth  century. In Brailes Church, Warwickshire, is an ancient chest of the  fifteenth century covered with panel-work compartments, with plain pointed  arches foliated in the heads. Panelled chests of this century are  numerous. In Shanklin Church, Isle of Wight, is a chest bearing the date  of 1519, on which no architectural ornament is displayed, but the initials  T. S. (Thomas Selkstead) are fancifully designed, and are separated by the  lock, and a coat of arms beneath.    In the south wall of each aisle, near the east end, and also in other  parts of the church, we frequently find the same kind of fenestella or  niche containing a piscina, and sometimes a credence shelf, as that before  described as being in the chancel: this is a plain indication that an  altar has been erected in this part of the church; and this end of the  aisle was generally separated from the rest of the church by a screen, the  lower part of panel, the upper part of open-work"]]]
