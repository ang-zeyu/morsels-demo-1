What if  he don't quite onderstand ye?\"    Dick replied by taking off his cap and throwing it down, at the same  time exclaiming, \"Take it yonder, pup,\" and pointing with his hand  towards the bluff.  The dog seized the cap, and went off with it at full  speed towards the willows, where it left it, and came galloping back for  the expected reward--not now, as in days of old, a bit of meat, but a  gentle stroke of its head and a hearty clap on its shaggy side.    \"Good pup, go now an' _fetch it_.\"    Away he went with a bound, and, in a few seconds, came back and  deposited the cap at his master's feet.    \"Will that do?\" asked Dick, triumphantly.    \"Ay, lad, it will.  The pup's worth its weight in goold.\"    \"Oui, I have said, and I say it agen, de dog is _human_, so him is.  If  not--fat am he?\"    Without pausing to reply to this perplexing question, Dick stepped  forward again, and in half an hour or so they were back in the camp.    \"Now for _your_ part of the work, Joe; yonder's the squaw that owns the  half-drowned baby.  Everything depends on her.\"    Dick pointed to the Indian woman as he spoke.  She was sitting beside  her tent, and playing at her knee was the identical youngster that had  been saved by Crusoe.    \"I'll manage it,\" said Joe, and walked towards her, while Dick and Henri  returned to the chiefs tent.    \"Does the Pawnee woman thank the Great Spirit that her child is saved?\"  began Joe as he came up.    \"She does,\" answered the woman, looking up at the hunter.  \"And her  heart is warm to the Pale-faces.\"    After a short silence Joe continued--    \"The Pawnee chiefs do not love the Pale-faces.  Some of them hate them.\"    \"The Dark Flower knows it,\" answered the woman; \"she is sorry.  She  would help the Pale-faces if she could.\"    This was uttered in a low tone, and with a meaning glance of the eye.    Joe hesitated again--could he trust her?  Yes; the feelings that filled  her breast and prompted her words were not those of the Indian just  now--they were those of a _mother_, whose gratitude was too full for  utterance.    \"Will the Dark Flower,\" said Joe, catching the name she had given  herself, \"help the Pale-face if he opens his heart to her?  Will she  risk the anger of her nation?\"    \"She will,\" replied the woman; \"she will do what she can.\"    Joe and his dark friend now dropped their high-sounding style of speech,  and spoke for some minutes rapidly in an undertone.  It was finally  arranged that on a given day, at a certain hour, the woman should take  the four horses down the shores of the lake to its lower end, as if she  were going for firewood, there cross the creek at the ford, and drive  them to the willow-bluff, and guard them till the hunters should arrive.    Having settled this, Joe returned to the tent and informed his comrades  of his success.    During the next three days Joe kept the Indians in good-humour by giving  them one or two trinkets, and speaking in glowing terms of the riches of  the white men, and the readiness with which they would part with them to  the savages if they would only make peace.    Meanwhile, during the dark hours of each night, Dick managed to abstract  small quantities of goods from their pack, in room of which he stuffed  in pieces of leather to keep up the size and appearance.  The goods thus  taken out he concealed about his person, and went off with a careless  swagger to the outskirts of the village, with Crusoe at his heels.  Arrived there, he tied the goods in a small piece of deerskin, and gave  the bundle to the dog, with the injunction, \"Take it yonder, pup.\"    Crusoe took it up at once, darted off at full speed with the bundle in  his mouth, down the shore of the lake towards the ford of the river, and  was soon lost to view.  In this way, little by little, the goods were  conveyed by the faithful dog to the willow-bluff and left there, while  the stuffed pack still remained in safekeeping in the chief's tent.    Joe did not at first like the idea of thus sneaking off from the camp;  and more than once made strong efforts to induce San-it-sa-rish to let  him go, but even that chief's countenance was not so favourable as it  had been.  It was clear that he could not make up his mind to let slip  so good a chance of obtaining guns, powder, and shot, horses and goods,  without any trouble; so Joe made up his mind to give them the slip at  once.    A dark night was chosen for the attempt, and the Indian woman went off  with the horses to the place where firewood for the camp was usually  cut.  Unfortunately the suspicion of that wily savage Mahtawa had been  awakened, and he stuck close to the hunters all day--not knowing what  was going on, but feeling convinced that something was brewing which he  resolved to watch, without mentioning his suspicions to any one.    \"I think that villain's away at last,\" whispered Joe to his comrades;  \"it's time to go, lads, the moon won't be up for an hour.  Come along.\"    \"Have ye got the big powder-horn, Joe?\"    \"Ay, ay, all right.\"    \"Stop! stop! my knife, my couteau.  Ah! here it be.  Now, boy.\"    The three set off as usual, strolling carelessly to the outskirts of the  camp; then they quickened their pace, and, gaining the lake, pushed off  in a small canoe.    At the same moment Mahtawa stepped from the bushes, leaped into another  canoe and followed them.    \"Hah! he must die,\" muttered Henri.    \"Not at all,\" said Joe, \"we'll manage him without that.\"    The chief landed and strode boldly up to them, for he knew well that  whatever their purpose might be, they would not venture to use their  rifles within sound of the camp at that hour of the night; as for their  knives, he could trust to his own active limbs and the woods to escape  and give the alarm if need be.    \"The Pale-faces hunt very late,\" he said with a malicious grin.  \"Do  they love the dark better than the sunshine?\"    \"Not so,\" replied Joe, coolly, \"but we love to walk by the light of the  moon.  It will be up in less than an hour, and we mean to take a long  ramble to-night.\"    \"The Pawnee chief loves to walk by the moon too, he will go with the  Pale-faces.\"    \"Good,\" ejaculated Joe.  \"Come along, then.\"    The party immediately set forward, although the savage was a little  taken by surprise at the indifferent way in which Joe received his  proposal to accompany them.  He walked on to the edge of the prairie,  however, and then stopped.    \"The Pale-faces must go alone,\" said he; \"Mahtawa will return to his  tent.\"    Joe replied to this intimation by seizing him suddenly by the throat and  choking back the yell that would otherwise have brought the Pawnee  warriors rushing to the scene of action in hundreds.  Mahtawa's hand was  on the handle of his scalping-knife in a moment, but before he could  draw it, his arms were glued to his sides by the bear-like embrace of  Henri, while Dick tied a handkerchief quickly yet firmly round his  mouth.  The whole thing was accomplished in two minutes.  After taking  his knife and tomahawk away, they loosened their gripe and escorted him  swiftly over the prairie.    Mahtawa was perfectly submissive after the first convulsive struggle was  over.  He knew that the men who walked on each side of him grasping his  arms were more than his match singly, so he wisely made no resistance.    Hurrying him to a clump of small trees on the plain which was so far  distant from the village that a yell could not be heard, they removed  the bandage from Mahtawa's mouth.    \"_Must_ he be kill?\" inquired Henri, in a tone of commiseration.    \"Not at all\" answered Joe, \"we'll tie him to a tree and leave him  there.\"    \"Then he vill be starve to deat'.  Oh! dat is more horrobell!\"    \"He must take his chance o' that.  I've no doubt his friends'll find him  in a day or two, an' he's game to last for a week or more.  But you'll  have to run to the willow-bluff, Dick, and bring a bit of line to tie  him.  We can't spare it well; but there's no help.\"    \"But there _is_ help,\" retorted Dick.  \"Just order the villain to climb  into that tree.\"    \"Why so, lad?\"    \"Don't ask questions, but do what I bid ye.\"    The hunter smiled for a moment as he turned to the Indian, and ordered  him to climb up a small tree near to which he stood.  Mahtawa looked  surprised, but there was no alternative.  Joe's authoritative tone  brooked no delay, so he sprang into the tree like a monkey.    \"Crusoe,\" said Dick, \"_watch him_!\"    The dog sat quietly down at the foot of the tree, and fixed his eyes on  the savage with a glare that spoke unutterable things.  At the same time  he displayed his full compliment of teeth, and uttered a sound like  distant thunder.    Joe almost laughed, and Henri did laugh outright.    \"Come along, he's safe now,\" cried Dick, hurrying away in the direction  of the willow-bluff, which they soon reached, and found that the  faithful squaw had tied their steeds to the bushes, and, moreover, had  bundled up their goods into a pack, and strapped it on the back of the  pack-horse; but she had not remained with them.    \"Bless yer dark face,\" ejaculated Joe as he sprang into the saddle and  rode out of the clump of bushes.  He was followed immediately by the  others, and in three minutes they were flying over the plain at full  speed.    On gaining the last far-off ridge, that afforded a distant view of the  woods skirting the Pawnee camp, they drew up, and Dick, putting his  fingers to his mouth, drew a long, shrill whistle.    It reached the willow-bluff like a faint echo.  At the same moment the  moon arose and more clearly revealed Crusoe's catalyptic glare at the  Indian chief, who, being utterly unarmed, was at the dog's mercy.  The  instant the whistle fell on his ear, however, he dropped his eyes,  covered his teeth, and, leaping through the bushes, flew over the plains"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#19)"],[1," satisfactory  manner; besides, if Jambai took it into his head to pursue us, in order  to ascertain whether we had had anything to do with the rescue, our case  would be hopeless.  It was equally impossible to leave her where she  was, and to let her try to make her escape through the woods alone was  not to be thought of.  While we pondered this dilemma an idea occurred  to me.    \"It seems to me,\" said I, \"that men are seldom, perhaps never, thrown  into a danger or difficulty in this world without some way of escape  being opened up, which, if they will but grasp at it promptly, will  conduct them at last out of their perplexities.  Now, it has just  occurred to me that, since everything else seems to be impossible, we  might send Okandaga into the woods, with Makarooroo to guide and defend  her and to hunt for her.  Let them travel in a line parallel with the  river route which we intend to follow.  Each night Mak will make a  secure shelter for her, and then return to our camp as if he had come in  from hunting.  Each morning he will set off again into the woods as if  to hunt, rejoin Okandaga; and thus we will journey together, as it were,  and when we reach the next tribe of natives we will leave the girl in  their charge until we return from the gorilla country.  What do you  think of that plan?\"    \"Not a bad one,\" replied Jack; \"but if Mak is away all day, what are we  to do for an interpreter?\"    \"Make him describe to us and to the men the day's route before leaving  us,\" suggested Peterkin; \"and as for the talking, we can manage that  well enough for all needful purposes by a mixture of the few phrases we  know with signs.\"    In the excitement of this whole affair we had totally forgotten our two  prisoners, who lay not far from us on the ground, gagged and pinioned.  We were now reminded of their presence rather abruptly.  We must have  secured their fastenings badly, for during the time we were conversing  they managed to free themselves, and made a sudden dash past us.  Jack's  eye fortunately caught sight of them in time.  He sprang up, rushed at  the one nearest him, and throwing out his foot as he passed, tripped him  up.  It chanced that at that spot there was a deep hole in the floor of  the cavern.  Into this the poor wretch plunged head first, and he was  killed on the spot.  Meanwhile, the other gained the outlet of the cave,  and had almost escaped into the forest, when Makarooroo darted after him  with the speed of an antelope.  In a few seconds we heard a cry, and  shortly after our guide returned with his knife clotted with blood.  He  had overtaken and slain the other negro.    I cannot convey to the reader the horror that filled me and my two  companions at this unexpected and melancholy termination of the affair.  Yet we felt that we were guiltless of rashly spilling human blood, for  Jack had no intention of killing the poor negro whom he tripped up; and  as to the other, we could not have prevented our guide from doing what  he did.  He himself deemed it justifiable, and said that if that man had  escaped to the village, and told who it was that frightened them out of  the cave, they would certainly have come back and murdered us all.  There was truth in this.  Still we could not but feel overwhelmed with  sadness at the incident.    We were now doubly anxious to get away from this cave, so we rapidly  finished the discussion of our plan, and Jack arranged that he should  accompany what may be termed the overland part of our expedition.  This  settled, we washed the charcoal off our persons, with the exception of  that on our faces, having been advised by King Jambai himself to hunt  with black faces, as wild animals were quicker to perceive our white  skins than their black ones.  Then we resumed our garments, and quitting  the haunted cavern, set out on our return journey to the camp.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    PETERKIN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF, AND OKANDAGA IS DISPOSED OF, ETCETERA.    When within about three miles of the place where our men had been  ordered to haul the canoe out of the water and make the camp, we came to  a halt and prepared a spot for Okandaga to spend an hour or two in  sleep.  The poor creature was terribly exhausted.  We selected a very  sequestered place in a rocky piece of ground, where the light of the  small fire we kindled, in order to cook her some supper, could not be  seen by any one who might chance to pass by that way.    Jack remained with her, but the guide went on with us, in order to give  instructions to our men, who, when we arrived, seemed much surprised  that we had made such a bad hunt during the night.  Having pointed out  our route, Makarooroo then left us, and we lay down to obtain a few  hours' repose.    We had not lain more than an hour when one of our men awoke us, saying  that it was time to start; so we rose, very unwillingly, and embarked.    \"I say, Ralph,\" observed Peterkin, as we glided up the stream, which in  this place was narrow and sluggish, \"isn't it strange that mankind, as a  rule, with very few exceptions, should so greatly dislike getting up in  the morning?\"    \"It is rather curious, no doubt.  But I suspect we have ourselves to  thank for the disinclination.  If we did not sit up so late at night we  should not feel the indisposition to rise so strong upon us in the  morning.\"    \"There you are quite wrong, Ralph.  I always find that the sooner I go  to bed the later I am in getting up.  The fact is, I've tried every  method of rousing myself, and without success.  And yet I can say  conscientiously that I am desirous of improving; for when at sea I used  to have my cot slung at the head with a block-tackle, and I got one of  the middies to come when the watch was changed and lower me, so that my  head lay on the deck below, and my feet pointed to the beams above.  And  would you believe it, I got so accustomed to this at last that, when  desperately sleepy, I used to hold on in that position for a few  minutes, and secure a short nap during the process of suffocation with  blood to the head.\"    \"You must indeed have been incorrigible,\" said I, laughing.  \"Nevertheless, I feel assured that the want of will lies at the root of  the evil.\"    \"Of course you do,\" retorted Peterkin testily; \"people always say that  when I try to defend myself.\"    \"Is it not probable that people always say that just because they feel  that there is truth in the remark?\"    \"Humph!\" ejaculated my friend.    \"Besides,\" I continued, \"our success in battling with the evil  tendencies of our natures depends often very much on the manner in which  we make the attack.  I have pondered this subject deeply, and have come  to the conclusion that there is a certain moment in the awaking hour of  each day which if seized and improved gains for us the victory.  You  know Shakespeare's judicious remark--`There is a tide in the affairs of  men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,' or something to  that effect.  I never feel quite sure of the literal correctness of my  quotations, although I am generally certain as to the substance.  Well,  there is a tide also in the affair of getting up in the morning, and its  flood-point is the precise instant when you recover consciousness.  At  that moment every one, I believe, has moral courage to leap violently  out of bed; but let that moment pass, and you sink supinely back, if not  to sleep, at least into a desperate condition of unconquerable  lethargy.\"    \"You may be very correct in your reasoning,\" returned Peterkin; \"but not  having pondered that subject quite so deeply as you seem to have done, I  shall modestly refrain from discussing it.  Meanwhile I will go ashore,  and stalk yonder duck which floats so comfortably and lazily in the cove  just beyond the point ahead of us, that I think it must be in the  condition of one who, having missed the flood-tide you have just  referred to, is revelling in the luxury of its second nap.--Ho, you  ebony-faced scoundrel!\" he added, turning to the negro who steered our  canoe; \"shove ashore, like a good fellow.--Come, Ralph, lend me your  fowling-piece, and do you carry my big rifle.  There is nothing so good  for breakfast as a fat duck killed and roasted before it has had time to  cool.\"    \"And here is a capital spot on which to breakfast,\" said I, as we  landed.    \"First-rate.  Now then, follow me, and mind your muzzle.  Better put the  rifle over your shoulder, Ralph, so that if it does go off it may hit  the sun or one of the stars.  A six-ounce ball in one's spine is not a  pleasant companion in a hunting expedition.\"    \"But,\" retorted I, \"you forget that I am particularly careful.  I always  carry my piece on half-cock, and _never_ put my finger on the trigger.\"    \"Indeed: not even when you pull it?\"    \"Of course when I am about to fire; but you know well enough what I  mean.\"    \"Hush, Ralph! we must keep silence now and step lightly.\"    In a few minutes we had gained the clump of bushes close behind which  the duck lay; and Peterkin, going down on all fours, crept forward to  get a shot.  I followed him in the same manner, and when he stopped to  take a deliberate aim, I crept up alongside.  The duck had heard our  approach, and was swimming about in a somewhat agitated manner among the  tall reeds, so that my companion made one or two unsuccessful attempts  to take aim.    \"What an aggravating thing!\" exclaimed Peterkin in a whisper.    At that moment I happened to cast my eyes across the river, and the  reader may judge of my surprise when I beheld two elephants standing  among the trees.  They stood so silently and so motionless, and were so  like in colour to the surrounding foliage, that we had actually  approached to within about thirty yards without observing them.  I  touched Peterkin on the shoulder, and pointed to them without saying a  word.  The expression of amazement that instantly overspread his  features showed"]]]
