This way and that way he went in great  leaps.  It was truly wonderful.    \"That long tail is what balances him,\" explained Old Mother Nature.  \"If he should lose it he would simply turn over and over and never  know where or how he was going to land.  His jumping is done only  in times of danger.  When he is not alarmed he runs about on the  ground like the rest of the Mouse family.  This is all for to-day.  To-morrow I will tell you still more about the Mouse family.\"        CHAPTER XVII  Three Little Redcoats and Some Others    With Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, Danny Meadow Mouse and Nimbleheels  the Jumping Mouse attending school, the Mouse family was well  represented, but when school opened the morning after Nimbleheels  had made his sudden and startling appearance, there was still  another present.  It was Piney the Pine Mouse.  Whitefoot, who  knew him, had hunted him up and brought him along.    \"I thought you wouldn't mind if Piney came,\" explained Whitefoot.    \"I'm glad he has come,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"It is much  better to see a thing than merely to be told about it, and now you  have a chance to see for yourselves the differences between two  cousins very closely related, Danny Meadow Mouse and Piney the  Pine Mouse.  What difference do you see, Happy Jack Squirrel?\"    \"Piney is a little smaller than Danny, though he is much the same  shape,\" was the prompt reply.    \"True,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"Now, Striped Chipmunk, what  difference do you see?\"    \"The fur of Piney's coat is shorter, finer and has more of a shine.  Then, too, it is more of a reddish-brown than Danny's,\" replied  Striped Chipmunk.    \"And what do you say, Peter Rabbit?\" asked Old Mother Nature.    \"Piney has a shorter tail,\" declared Peter, and everybody laughed.    \"Trust you to look at his tail first,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"These are the chief differences as far as looks are concerned.  Their habits differ in about the same degree.  As you all know,  Danny cuts little paths through the grass.  Piney doesn't do this,  but makes little tunnels just under the surface of the ground very  much as Miner the Mole does.  He isn't fond of the open Green  Meadows or of damp places as Danny is, but likes best the edge of  the Green Forest and brushy places.  He is very much at home in a  poorly kept orchard where the weeds are allowed to grow and in young  orchards he does a great deal of damage by cutting off the roots of  young trees and stripping off the bark as high up as he can reach.  Tell us, Piney, how and where you make your home.\"    Piney hesitated a little, for he was bashful.  \"I make my home under  ground,\" he ventured finally.  \"I dig a nice little bedroom with  several entrances from my tunnels, and in it I make a fine nest of  soft grass.  Close by I dig one or more rooms in which to store my  food, and these usually are bigger than my bedroom.  When I get one  filled with food I close it up by filling the entrance with earth.\"    \"What do you put in your storerooms?\" asked Peter Rabbit.    \"Short pieces of grass and pieces of roots of different kinds,\"  replied Piney.  \"I am very fond of tender roots and the bark of  trees and bushes.    \"And he dearly loves to get in a garden where he can tunnel along  a row of potatoes or other root crops,\" added Old Mother Nature.  \"Because of these habits he does a great deal of damage and is much  disliked by man.  Striped Chipmunk mentioned his reddish-brown coat.  There is another cousin with a coat so red that he is called the  Red-backed Mouse.  He is about the size of Danny Meadow Mouse but  has larger ears and a longer tail.    \"This little fellow is a lover of the Green Forest, and he is quite  as active by day as by night.  He is pretty, especially when he sits  up to eat, holding his food in his paws as does Happy Jack Squirrel.  He makes his home in a burrow, the entrance to which is under an old  stump, a rock or the root of a tree.  His nest is of soft grass or  moss.  Sometimes he makes it in a hollow log or stump instead of  digging a bedroom under ground.  He is thrifty and lays up a supply  of food in underground rooms, hollow logs and similar places.  He  eats seeds, small fruits, roots and various plants.  Because of  his preference for the Green Forest and the fact that he lives as  a rule far from the homes of men, he does little real damage.    \"There is still another little Redcoat in the family, and he is  especially interesting because while he is related to Danny Meadow  Mouse he lives almost wholly in trees.  He is called the Rufous  Tree Mouse.  Rufous means reddish-brown, and he gets that name  because of the color of his coat.  He lives in the great forests  of the Far West, where the trees are so big and tall that the  biggest tree you have ever seen would look small beside them.  And  it is in those great trees that the Rufous Tree Mouse lives.    \"Just why he took to living in trees no one knows, for he belongs  to that branch of the family known as Ground Mice.  But live in  them he does, and he is quite as much at home in them as  any Squirrel.\"    Chatterer the Red Squirrel was interested right away.  \"Does he  build a nest in a tree like a Squirrel?\" he asked.    \"He certainly does,\" replied Old Mother Nature, \"and often it is a  most remarkable nest.  In some sections he places it only in big  trees, sometimes a hundred feet from the ground.  In other sections  it is placed in small trees and only a few feet above the ground.  The high nests often are old deserted nests of Squirrels enlarged  and built over.  Some of them are very large indeed and have been  used year after year.  Each year they have been added to.    \"One of these big nests will have several bedrooms and little  passages running all through it.  It appears that Mrs. Rufous  usually has one of these big nests to herself, Rufous having  a small nest of his own out on one of the branches.  The big  nest is close up against the trunk of the tree where several  branches meet.\"    \"Does Rufous travel from one tree to another, or does he live in  just one tree?\" asked Happy Jack Squirrel.    \"Wherever branches of one tree touch those of another, and you  know in a thick forest this is frequently the case, he travels  about freely if he wants to.  But those trees are so big that I  suspect he spends most of his time in the one in which his home  is,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"However, if an enemy appears  in his home tree, he makes his escape by jumping from one tree  to another, just as you would do.\"    \"What I want to know is where he gets his food if he spends all  his time up in the trees,\" spoke up Danny Meadow Mouse.    Old Mother Nature smiled.  \"Where should he get it but up where  he lives?\" she asked.  \"Rufous never has to worry about food.  It  is all around him.  You see, so far as known, he lives wholly on  the thick parts of the needles, which you know are the leaves, of  fir and spruce trees, and on the bark of tender twigs.  So you  see he is more of a tree dweller than any of the Squirrel family.  While Rufous has the general shape of Danny and his relatives, he  has quite a long tail.  Now I guess this will do for the nearest  relatives of Danny Meadow Mouse.\"    \"He certainly has a lot of them,\" remarked Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.  Then he added a little wistfully, \"Of course, in a way they are all  cousins of mine, but I wish I had some a little more closely related.\"    \"You have,\" replied Old Mother Nature, and Whitefoot pricked up  his big ears.  \"One of them Bigear the Rock Mouse, who lives out  in the mountains of the Far West.  He is as fond of the rocks as  Rufous is of the trees.  Sometimes he lives in brush heaps and in  brushy country, but he prefers rocks, and that is why he is known  as the Rock Mouse.    \"He is a pretty little fellow, if anything a trifle bigger than you,  Whitefoot, and he is dressed much like you with a yellowish-brown  coat and white waistcoat.  He has just such a long tail covered  with hair its whole length.  But you should see his ears.  He has  the largest ears of any member of the whole family.  That is why  he is called Bigear.  He likes best to be out at night, but often  comes out on dull days.  He eats seeds and small nuts and is  especially fond of juniper seeds.  He always lays up a supply of  food for winter.  Often he is found very high up on the mountains.    \"Another of your cousins, Whitefoot, lives along the seashore of  the East down in the Sunny South.  He is called the Beach Mouse.  In general appearance he is much like you, having the same shape,  long tail and big ears, but he is a little smaller and his coat  varies.  When he lives back from the shore, in fields where the  soil is dark, his upper coat is dark grayish-brown, but when he  lives on the white sands of the seashore it is very light.  His  home is in short burrows in the ground.    \"Now don't you little people think you have learned enough about  the Mouse family?\"    \"You haven't told us about Nibbler the House Mouse yet.  And you  said you would,\" protested Peter Rabbit.    \"And when we were learning about Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat you said  he was most closely related to the Pocket Mice.  What about them?\"  said Johnny Chuck.    Old Mother Nature laughed.  \"I see,\" said she, \"that you want to  know all there is to know.  Be on hand to-morrow morning.  I guess  we can finish up with the Mouse family then and with them the order  of Rodents to which all of you belong.\"        CHAPTER XVIII  Mice with Pockets, and Others    \"Pockets are very handy things for little people who are thrifty  and who live largely on small seeds.  Without pockets in which to  carry the seeds, I am afraid some of them would never be able to  store up enough food for winter,\" began"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#19)"],[1,"approach. In fact, if it did not come on,  if the demons withdrew from their intention, there would be great  disappointment. Brahman missionaries go great distances to inform the  people the eclipse is to take place, and to press on them the benefit  they will receive by bathing at Benares on that occasion. On their  return they are accompanied by those whom they have succeeded in  persuading. Leaving the mythological for the scientific platform, we had  better mention that the Hindu astronomers have for ages been able to  calculate eclipses; and now they need not trouble themselves to make  calculations, as European almanacks are in their hands to give the  requisite information.    For a few days previous to the eclipse of which I am now to speak, the  unusual number of strangers in the city made it evident some great event  was about to occur. From the morning of the appointed day the people  poured into the city in a constant stream. As evening came on I made my  way into the city on foot, but before reaching its centre I found the  streets so blocked that I despaired of getting to the riverside. I  retraced my steps, and by a road skirting the city made my way to Raj  Ghat at the northern end. There I remained till the eclipse commenced.  Many were near, but they were few compared with the crowds pressing  towards the chief bathing places. When I arrived at Raj Ghat the  confused sound of a great multitude fell on my ear, but no sooner did  the eclipse begin than the thousands on the river's brink and crowded on  the ghats, as with one voice raised a shout so loud and prolonged, that  I should think it must have been heard for miles. I was on a high bank  of the river, and could see distinctly the people below rushing into the  stream. I could not but think of what must be occurring where the crowd  was so dense that individual motion was well-nigh impossible. It was  reported next morning that three or four hundred persons had been  trampled to death or drowned in the rush to the river when the eclipse  began. This was afterwards declared to be an exaggerated statement, but  it is certain many lives were lost, though how many was not ascertained,  as a number were carried away by the stream. Special care was afterwards  taken by the authorities to prevent such catastrophes. After stopping  some time at Raj Ghat I returned to my home, musing on what I had seen,  and longing for the time when the millions of India will seek cleansing  and life, where alone they can be found.    [Sidenote: MELA AT ALLAHABAD.]    Towards the end of 1840 I went to Allahabad, seventy miles north-west of  Benares, to take part in evangelistic work at a great mela held there  annually, as I thought I might be able to render some help to my  brethren. Allahabad, called Pryag by the Hindus, is at the confluence of  the Ganges and the Jumna, and all such places are deemed sacred. It is  said there is a third river, the Suruswatee, once visible but now  underground, and the place is therefore called Tribeni--the threefold  stream. Pryag has been for many years a famous place of pilgrimage, and  every year a mela is held, which is at its height for some seven days,  but is kept on for weeks. It is held in the cold weather, December or  January; and, next to Hurdwar, where the Ganges issues from the  mountains, draws a greater crowd than any other mela in Northern India.  Bathing at Tribeni is peculiarly meritorious in some years, and in these  there is a vastly increased attendance. Except on the occasion of  eclipses there is no such gathering even at Benares; but very many who  go to Allahabad, before returning to their home, often a distant home,  pay a visit to the sacred city.    At one time the Government imposed a tax on pilgrims to this mela, but  it was taken off in 1838 or 1839.    The mela is held below the fort, on the land lying between the Ganges  and the Jumna at their point of meeting, on a great stretch of sand,  which is covered in the rainy season. In December and January the west  wind blows freshly over the place, and as there is incessant movement,  soon all present are so covered with dust that they look like millers.    [Sidenote: EVANGELISTIC SERVICES.]    A gathering like this at Allahabad is always embraced for evangelistic  purposes. Missionaries and native brethren are thankful for the  opportunity afforded them of preaching the Gospel to many who have come  from places to which no missionary has ever gone. The missionaries at  Allahabad gladly welcome and hospitably entertain the brethren of other  missions who join them at these annual gatherings. Large tents are put  up, with the front open towards the road, and there the preachers from  morning till evening, preacher succeeding preacher, address the people,  while hearers succeed hearers. A few individuals stop a long time, as if  rapt up in what they hear, as if they were drinking in every word;  others stop a considerable time; while many, after looking on and gaping  for a few minutes, hold on their way. Every now and then questions are  asked, objections are started, and a discussion ensues. When the  questions are in any measure serious and reasonable, much benefit  results from such discussion. The interest of the people is quickened,  and opportunity is afforded for explaining, defending, and enforcing the  truth as it is in Jesus. Sometimes the questioner is neither serious nor  reasonable, and then the danger is of the discussion turning into a  wrangle, which does more harm than good. Prominent transgressors in this  line are the Pundas, specially interested in the mela, who do all in  their power to set the people against us. At this first great gathering  which I attended--I found it was the case afterwards on similar  occasions--there was less mere idle discussion than there is where the  missionary carries on his work from day to day. In addition to  preaching-stations, there were bookstalls where portions of the  Scriptures and Christian tracts and books were disposed of. On to the  time of this mela there was a large gratuitous distribution among  persons who from their look and manner were deemed suitable recipients;  but for many years it has been found best to charge a small price,  without adopting a hard and fast line against giving away.    It is very difficult, rather impossible, to estimate the effect produced  by evangelistic services on such occasions. They have not been fruitless  as to conversion, but if we look simply at results of this kind it must  be acknowledged they are very limited. Instances have occurred of  persons having been so impressed that they have followed missionaries to  places far away from Allahabad; but their courage has failed them, and  they have after a short time disappeared. One advantage is secured--the  Gospel is kept before the minds of the people, and some knowledge of it  is carried to the remotest parts of the land. Books and tracts are taken  to places which missionaries have never visited. It cannot be doubted  that such services have their part in preparing the people for the new  and better state of things which every Christian longs for and expects.    At Allahabad I had an opportunity of observing the peculiarities of a  great Hindu mela. The morning was devoted to bathing and the performance  of religious rites. As the forenoon came on, the merchants of every  class set out their wares in tents erected on sites appointed for them,  with their opening, so far as possible, away from the side exposed to  the wind. Goods of every description, useful and ornamental, cloth,  grain, cooking vessels, trinkets, and sweetmeats, were exhibited to  tempt purchasers, and buying and selling went on as vigorously as if the  people had come together solely for that end. Crowds were in constant  motion, going from place to place to see what could be seen, and  stopping where there was any special attraction, or, as happens in our  own crowded streets, stopping where a few were incidentally collected.  By the afternoon, singers, experts in tricks, and show-people of every  description, commenced their operations, and were sure of admiring  crowds. The merry-go-rounds were largely patronized. Hour after hour was  thus spent.    [Sidenote: COOKING AND MERRYMAKING.]    A few cooked food early in the day, but the vast majority staved off  hunger--in some cases by partaking of cakes reserved from the previous  evening meal; the greater number, I believe, by partaking of sweetmeats  made with flour, sugar, and melted butter, of which an enormous quantity  was offered for sale. As evening came on they scattered themselves over  the ground lying between the Ganges and the Jumna, and set to the  preparation of their one proper meal for the twenty-four hours. The  plain was alight with their fires. Nothing can be simpler than their  cooking. They make what they call a _choola_, an elevation in the shape  of a horseshoe of a half-foot or a little more of moistened mud, or  stone if they can get it. If the traveller be of a respectable caste, he  takes care to make no use of the _choolas_ which former travellers have  left. They may have been set up by impure hands, and so he makes one for  himself. It is convenient to have two such _choolas_, that they may put  on the one a small pot with rice or _dal_, a kind of pea, in it, and on  the other a girdle for bannocks of unleavened dough. Cooking is, of  course, largely women's work, but men are as expert at it as women, and  are continually seen preparing their meal. I have never travelled with a  native who seemed to think he was called to an unusual or unpleasant  work, when required to cook his food. All he needs is a couple of small  cooking vessels, which he carries with him, a little fuel, good water,  meal, and a spot on which he may set up his humble hearth. I have seen  this work done by pundits, learned men, who showed no indication of  shrinking from "]]]
