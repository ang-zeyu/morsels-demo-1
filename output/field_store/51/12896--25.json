He informs us on the authority of 'David the prophet, and  of Moses,' that the greater part of the angels who rebelled under  the leadership of Lucifer, lost their former power and beauty,  and became 'fiendes black:' that instead of being precipitated  into 'helle-pit,' many remained in mid-air, where they still  retain the faculty of seducing mortals by assuming whatever  shape they please. These had been much concerned at the  miraculous birth of Christ; but it was hoped to counteract the  salutary effects of that event, by producing from some virgin a  semi-demon, whose office it should be to disseminate sorcerers  and wicked men. For this purpose the devil[85] prepares to seduce  three young sisters; and proceeds at once in proper disguise to  an old woman, with whose avarice and cunning he was well  acquainted. Her he engaged by liberal promises to be mediatrix in  the seduction of the elder sister, whom he was prevented from  attempting in person by the precautions of a holy hermit. Like  'the first that fell of womankind,' the young lady at length  consented; was betrayed by the _fictitious_ youth, and condemned  by the law to be burnt alive.      [85] Probably,           'Belial, the dissolutest spirit that fell,          The sensualist; and after Asmodai          The fleshliest Incubus.'--_Par. Reg._    The same fate, excepting the fearful penalty, awaited the second.  And now, too late, the holy hermit became aware of his disastrous  negligence. He strictly enjoined on the third and remaining  sister a constant watch. Her security, however, was the cause of  her betrayal. On one occasion, in a moment of remissness, she  forgot her prayers and the sign of the cross, before retiring for  the night. No longer excluded, the fiend, assuming human shape,  effected his purpose. In due time a son was born, whose  parentage was sufficiently evinced by an entire covering of black  hair, although his limbs were well-formed, and his features fine.  Fortunately, the careless guardian had exactly calculated the  moment of the demon's birth; and no sooner was he informed of the  event, than the new-born infant was borne off to the regenerating  water, when he was christened by the name of Merlin; the fond  hopes of the demons being for this time, at least, irretrievably  disappointed. How Merlin, by superhuman prowess and knowledge,  defeated the Saracens (Saxons) in many bloody battles; his  magical achievements and favour at the court of King Vortigern  and his successors, are fully exhibited by the author of the  history.[86] Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts them as matters of  fact; and they are repeated by Vergil in the History of Britain,  composed under the auspices of Henry VIII.      [86] See _Early English Metrical Romances_, ed. by Sir H.    Ellis.    By the ancients, whole peoples were sometimes said to be derived  from these unholy connections. Jornandes, the historian of the  Goths, is glad to be able to relate their hated rivals, the Huns  (of whom the Kalmuck Tartars are commonly said to be the modern  representatives), to have owed their origin to an intercourse of  the Scythian witches with infernal spirits. The extraordinary  form and features of those dreaded emigrants from the steppes of  Tartary, had suggested to the fear and hatred of their European  subjects, a fable which Gibbon supposes might have been derived  from a more pleasing one of the Greeks.[87]      [87] A sufficiently large collection from ancient and modern    writers of the facts of _inhuman_ connections may be seen in    the _Anatomy of Melancholy_, part iii. sect. 2. Having    repeated the assertions of previous authors proving the fact    of intercourses of human with inferior species of animals,    Burton fortifies his own opinion of their reality by    numerous authorities. If those stories be true, he reasons,    that are written of Incubus and Succubus, of nymphs,    lascivious fauns, satyrs, and those heathen gods which were    devils, those lascivious Telchines of whom the Platonists    tell so many fables; or those familiar meetings in our day    [1624] and company of witches and devils, there is some    probability for it. I know that Biarmannus, Wierus, and some    others stoutly deny it ... but Austin (lib. xv. _de Civit.    Dei_) doth acknowledge it. And he refers to Plutarch, _Vita    Numae; Wierus, de Praestigiis Daemon., Giraldus Cambrensis,    Malleus Malef., Jacobus Reussus, Godelman, Erastus, John    Nider, Delrio, Lipsius, Bodin, Pererius, King James, &c_.    The learned and curious work of the melancholy Student of    Christ Church and Oxford Rector has been deservedly    commended by many eminent critics. That 'exact mathematician    and curious calculator of nativities' calculated exactly,    according to Anthony Wood (_Athenae Oxon._), the period of    his own death--1639.    The acts of Incubus assume an important part in witch-trials and  confessions. Incubus is the visitor of females, Succubus of  males. Chaucer satirises the gallantries of the vicarious Incubus  by the mouth of the wife of Bath (that practical admirer of  Solomon and the Samaritan woman),[88] who prefaces her tale with  the assurance:--        That maketh that ther ben no fayeries,      For ther as wont was to walken an elf      Ther walketh noon but the _Lymitour_ himself.        *       *       *       *       *        Women may now go safely up and downe;      In every busch and under every tre      Ther is noon other _Incubus_ but he.      [88] The wife of Bath, who had buried only her fifth    husband, must appear modest by comparison. Not to mention    Seneca's or Martial's assertions or insinuations, St. Jerome    was acquainted with the case of a woman who had buried her    _twenty-second_ husband, whose conjugal capacity, however,    was exceeded by the Dutch wife who, on the testimony of    honest John Evelyn, had buried her _twenty-fifth_ husband!    Reginald Scot has devoted several chapters of his work to a  relation of the exploits of Incubus.[89] But he honestly warns  his readers 'whose chaste ears cannot well endure to hear of such  lecheries (gathered out of the books of divinity of great  authority) to turn over a few leaves wherein I have, like a  groom, thrust their stuff, even that which I myself loath, as  into a stinking corner: howbeit none otherwise, I hope, but that  the other parts of my writing shall remain sweet.' He repeats a  story from the 'Vita Hieronymi,' which seems to insinuate some  suspicion of the character of a certain Bishop Sylvanus. It  relates that one night Incubus invaded a certain lady's bedroom.  Indignant at so unusual, or at least disguised, an apparition,  the lady cried out loudly until the guests of the house came and  found it under the bed in the likeness of the bishop; 'which holy  man,' adds Scot, 'was much defamed thereby.' Another tradition or  legend seems to reflect upon the chastity of the greatest saint  of the Middle Ages.[90] The superhuman oppression of Incubus is  still remembered in the proverbial language of the present day.  The horrors of the infernal compacts and leagues, as exhibited in  the fates of wizards or magicians at the last hour, formed one of  the most popular scenes on the theatrical stage. Christopher  Marlow, in 'The Life and Death of Dr. Faustus,' and Robert  Greene, in 'Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay,' in the Elizabethan  age, dramatised the common, conception of the Compact.      [89] See the fourth book of the _Discoverie_.      [90] 'It is written in the legend of St. Bernard,' we are    told, 'that a pretty wench that had the use of Incubus his    body by the space of six or seven years in Aquitania (being    belike weary of him for that he waxed old), would needs go to    St. Bernard another while. But Incubus told her if she would    so forsake him, he would be revenged upon her. But befal what    would, she went to St. Bernard, who took her his staff and    bad her lay it in the bed beside her. And, indeed, the devil,    fearing the staff or that St. Bernard lay there himself,    durst not approach into her chamber that night. What he did    afterwards I am uncertain.' This story will not appear so    evidential to the reader as Scot seems to infer it to be. If    any credit is to be given to the strong insinuations of    Protestant divines of the sixteenth century, the 'holy bishop    Sylvanus' is not the only example among the earlier saints of    the frailty of human nature.

The ceremonies of the compact by which a woman became a witch  have been already referred to. It was almost an essential  condition in the vulgar creed that she should be, as Gaule  ('Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches,' &c., 1646)  represents, an old woman with a wrinkled face, a furred brow, a  hairy lip, a gobber tooth, a squint eye, a squeaking voice, a  scolding tongue, having a ragged coat on her back, a skull-cap on  her head, a spindle in her hand, a dog or cat by her side. There  are three sorts of the devil's agents on earth--the black, the  gray, and the white witches. The first are omnipotent for evil,  but powerless for good. The white have the power to help, but not  to hurt.[91] As for the third species (a mixture of white and  black), they are equally "]]]
