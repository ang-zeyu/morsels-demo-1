This is  because the height of the Ionic capital is only one third of the  thickness of the column, while that of the Corinthian is the entire  thickness of the shaft. Hence, as two thirds are added in Corinthian  capitals, their tallness gives a more slender appearance to the columns  themselves.    2. The other members which are placed above the columns, are, for  Corinthian columns, composed either of the Doric proportions or  according to the Ionic usages; for the Corinthian order never had any  scheme peculiar to itself for its cornices or other ornaments, but may  have mutules in the coronae and guttae on the architraves according to  the triglyph system of the Doric style, or, according to Ionic  practices, it may be arranged with a frieze adorned with sculptures and  accompanied with dentils and coronae.    3. Thus a third architectural order, distinguished by its capital, was  produced out of the two other orders. To the forms of their columns are  due the names of the three orders, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, of  which the Doric was the first to arise, and in early times. For Dorus,  the son of Hellen and the nymph Phthia, was king of Achaea and all the  Peloponnesus, and he built a fane, which chanced to be of this order, in  the precinct of Juno at Argolis, a very ancient city, and subsequently  others of the same order in the other cities of Achaea, although the  rules of symmetry were not yet in existence.    4. Later, the Athenians, in obedience to oracles of the Delphic Apollo,  and with the general agreement of all Hellas, despatched thirteen  colonies at one time to Asia Minor, appointing leaders for each colony  and giving the command-in-chief to Ion, son of Xuthus and Creusa (whom  further Apollo at Delphi in the oracles had acknowledged as his son).  Ion conducted those colonies to Asia Minor, took possession of the land  of Caria, and there founded the grand cities of Ephesus, Miletus, Myus  (long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage  handed over by the Ionians to the Milesians), Priene, Samos, Teos,  Colophon, Chius, Erythrae, Phocaea, Clazomenae, Lebedos, and Melite.  This Melite, on account of the arrogance of its citizens, was destroyed  by the other cities in a war declared by general agreement, and in its  place, through the kindness of King Attalus and Arsinoe, the city of the  Smyrnaeans was admitted among the Ionians.    5. Now these cities, after driving out the Carians and Lelegans, called  that part of the world Ionia from their leader Ion, and there they set  off precincts for the immortal gods and began to build fanes: first of  all, a temple to Panionion Apollo such as they had seen in Achaea,  calling it Doric because they had first seen that kind of temple built  in the states of the Dorians.    6. Wishing to set up columns in that temple, but not having rules for  their symmetry, and being in search of some way by which they could  render them fit to bear a load and also of a satisfactory beauty of  appearance, they measured the imprint of a man's foot and compared this  with his height. On finding that, in a man, the foot was one sixth of  the height, they applied the same principle to the column, and reared  the shaft, including the capital, to a height six times its thickness at  its base. Thus the Doric column, as used in buildings, began to exhibit  the proportions, strength, and beauty of the body of a man.    7. Just so afterwards, when they desired to construct a temple to Diana  in a new style of beauty, they translated these footprints into terms  characteristic of the slenderness of women, and thus first made a column  the thickness of which was only one eighth of its height, so that it  might have a taller look. At the foot they substituted the base in  place of a shoe; in the capital they placed the volutes, hanging down at  the right and left like curly ringlets, and ornamented its front with  cymatia and with festoons of fruit arranged in place of hair, while they  brought the flutes down the whole shaft, falling like the folds in the  robes worn by matrons. Thus in the invention of the two different kinds  of columns, they borrowed manly beauty, naked and unadorned, for the  one, and for the other the delicacy, adornment, and proportions  characteristic of women.    8. It is true that posterity, having made progress in refinement and  delicacy of feeling, and finding pleasure in more slender proportions,  has established seven diameters of the thickness as the height of the  Doric column, and nine as that of the Ionic. The Ionians, however,  originated the order which is therefore named Ionic.    The third order, called Corinthian, is an imitation of the slenderness  of a maiden; for the outlines and limbs of maidens, being more slender  on account of their tender years, admit of prettier effects in the way  of adornment.    9. It is related that the original discovery of this form of capital was  as follows. A free-born maiden of Corinth, just of marriageable age, was  attacked by an illness and passed away. After her burial, her nurse,  collecting a few little things which used to give the girl pleasure  while she was alive, put them in a basket, carried it to the tomb, and  laid it on top thereof, covering it with a roof-tile so that the things  might last longer in the open air. This basket happened to be placed  just above the root of an acanthus. The acanthus root, pressed down  meanwhile though it was by the weight, when springtime came round put  forth leaves and stalks in the middle, and the stalks, growing up along  the sides of the basket, and pressed out by the corners of the tile  through the compulsion of its weight, were forced to bend into volutes  at the outer edges.    [Illustration: Photo. Sommer    THE BASILICA AT POMPEII]    [Illustration: THE CORINTHIAN CAPITAL OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE  MONUMENTS]    10. Just then Callimachus, whom the Athenians called [Greek:  katatexitechnos] for the refinement and delicacy of his artistic  work, passed by this tomb and observed the basket with the tender  young leaves growing round it. Delighted with the novel style and form,  he built some columns after that pattern for the Corinthians, determined  their symmetrical proportions, and established from that time forth the  rules to be followed in finished works of the Corinthian order.    11. The proportions of this capital should be fixed as follows. Let the  height of the capital, including its abacus, be equivalent to the  thickness of the base of a column. Let the breadth of the abacus be  proportioned so that diagonals drawn from one corner of it to the other  shall be twice the height of the capitals, which will give the proper  breadth to each face of the abacus. The faces should curve inwards, by  one ninth of the breadth of the face, from the outside edge of the  corners of the abacus. At the bottom the capital should be of the  thickness of the top of the column omitting the conge and astragal. The  height of the abacus is one seventh of the height of the capital.    12. Omitting the height of the abacus, let the rest be divided into  three parts, of which one should be given to the lowest leaf. Let the  second leaf occupy the middle part of the height. Of the same height  should be the stalks, out of which grow leaves projected so as to  support the volutes which proceed from the stalks, and run out to the  utmost corners of the abacus; the smaller spirals between them should be  carved just under the flower which is on the abacus. The flowers on the  four sides are to be made as large as the height of the abacus. On these  principles of proportion, Corinthian capitals will be finished as they  ought to be.    There are other kinds of capitals set upon these same columns and called  by various names, but they have no peculiarities of proportion of which  we can speak, nor can we recognize from them another order of columns.  Even their very names are, as we can see, derived with some changes from  the Corinthian, the cushion-shaped, and the Doric, whose symmetrical  proportions have been thus transferred to delicate sculptures of novel  form.          CHAPTER II    THE ORNAMENTS OF THE ORDERS      1. Since the origin and invention of the orders of columns have been  described above, I think it not out of place to speak in the same way  about their ornaments, showing how these arose and from what original  elements they were devised. The upper parts of all buildings contain  timber work to which various terms are applied. And not only in its  terminology but actually in its uses it exhibits variety. The main beams  are those which are laid upon columns, pilasters, and antae; tie-beams  and rafters are found in the framing. Under the roof, if the span is  pretty large, are the crossbeams and struts; if it is of moderate  extent, only the ridgepole, with the principal rafters extending to the  outer edge of the eaves. Over the principal rafters are the purlines,  and then above these and under the roof-tiles come the common rafters,  extending so far that the walls are covered by their projection.    2. Thus each and every detail has a place, origin, and order of its own.  In accordance with these details, and starting from carpenter's work,  artists in building temples of stone and marble imitated those  arrangements in their sculptures, believing that they must follow those  inventions. So it was that some ancient carpenters, engaged in building  somewhere or other, after laying the tie-beams so that they projected  from the inside to the outside of the walls, closed up the space between  the beams, and above them ornamented the coronae and gables with  carpentry work of beauty greater than usual; then they cut off the  projecting ends of the beams, bringing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#19)"],[1," his own intimate vision, which is that of a mathematician! This  is just another attempt to formulate an hypothetical existence of a  supernatural being.\"    The theologians, by this time thoroughly aroused, lay down a verbal  barrage, and learned Jesuits place before the visitor a recent  publication entitled, \"The Question and Answer\" by Hilaire Belloc. The  author, acting as the mouthpiece of the Roman Catholic Church, attempts  to prove two things: namely, whether God is, and that the witness to  Revelation is the Roman Catholic Church. Were it not for the fact that  the work was published by permission of the Church, one could logically  suppose from its arguments that the author was attempting to give the  answer, \"No,\" to the question propounded, as to whether God is. There is  one sentence, however, to which the Martian agrees: this one, \"But  religions, though not very numerous, considering the vast spaces of time  over which we can study them, and the vast number of millions to which  they apply, differ and contradict each other; on which account, any one  approaching this problem for the first time, and being made acquainted  at the outset with the variety of religions, would naturally conclude  that every religion is man-made, and every religion an illusion.\"    On reading the opening remarks, the Martian exclaims, \"This earthling  plainly tells us at the beginning that he will make his theories fit in  with his conclusion! He informs us that he does not seek the truth, no  matter where it may lead, but he only deems it necessary to fit ideas,  no matter how distorted, in order that the final conclusion will  simulate what he deliberately sets out to prove.\"    Mr. Belloc's statement, \"How many men will agree that wanton cruelty,  treason to family or the state, falsehood for private gain, breach of  faith, are admirable?\" strikes the Martian as absurd when viewed in the  light of the historical annals of the Church itself. Mr. Belloc's creed  must have considered these very vices as virtues, judging from the  actions of his Church.    In calling the Roman Catholic Church the witness to revelation, the  author continues with, \"Yet, that it should suffer from men's hatred and  persecution.\" If God has divinely ordained this institution as His  Church on earth, and in His omnipotence and omniscience allows this  Church to be hated, then how do the religionists assume that their god  is a god of love? The author tells us that He is a god of hate, such a  god as was conceived of by the barbarians and the Hebrews--cruel,  vengeful, and monstrous. Does not this apologist confuse his god with  his devil? Then again, has it not occurred to this apologist that he is  in all futility attempting to prove something which is a contradiction  within itself? If God is, and is benevolent, is it not logical to assume  (since the theologians assume all sorts of attributes to this deity)  that he would not have constructed the minds of men when He created them  so as to desire to doubt His being; would not have tortured the minds of  men with cruel doubt as to His existence?    If He is omnipotent, it would have been just as easy to instill into the  minds of men only the strongest desire to believe in His reality; and  even that would not be necessary had He so arranged matters that by His  everlasting presence He would reveal Himself or His deeds to man in such  a conclusive manner that even the feeblest of intellects could not  doubt His existence.    If He is omniscient, as the parable asserts, that not a hair falls from  the head of man, not a sparrow dies without His knowledge, it must  therefore be apparent that He created man with the foreknowledge that  man would doubt His existence. This is a contradiction in itself.    The Martian notes that in the entire length of the work not a reference  is made to the time-worn theological defense, \"the revelation\" which the  Church has always claimed for its scriptures.    Appended as an afterthought, as an apology, as it were, for the  philosophical defense and not the theological, the Jesuit father reminds  the reader of its messiah, Jesus and the New Testament. The Jesuit  states, \"The New Testament writings, considered merely as trustworthy  historical documents, inform us that--\" but at this point the Martian  interrupted the speaker, for the audacity of any learned man terming the  New Testament writings \"historical\" was beyond his comprehension. It  brought forcibly to his attention the great change which the apologies  for the Church had undergone, and the new methods which they assumed.  The old theological defense of the deity was gone; not even philosophy  was deemed strong enough support for the present day. How the Church had  fallen! The Church which had persecuted, anathematized, burned, and  tortured the scientist, the geologist, the astronomer, the geographer,  the biologist, the chemist, and the physician; this same Church in its  last extremus, casts aside theology as its weapon and its appeal to the  minds of the sceptics whom they aim to convert. The Church casts aside  its own theology, having learned by bitter experience and recanting of  opinions, bulls, and infallible statements by infallible popes, and now  succumbs to the opinions it has formerly anathematized. In the present  age the Church calls science to its aid, and utterly disregards its  obsolete theology which it still practices, and attempts, by means of  the misinterpretation of scientific facts and statements of a few men  such as Eddington and Jeans, to force science into some illogical and  unscientific concordance with the conception of a supreme being.    Ironically it occurs to the Martian that the shades of Hypatia, Bruno,  Galileo, Copernicus, Vanini, Darwin, and the vast numbers of Waldenses,  Albigenses, Huguenots, Jews, and the victims of the Inquisition and the  Witch Hunt, must, as they contemplate the present tactics of that Holy  Institution, the Church, find some consolation in the depths of that  hell to which the Church consigned them. The Martian logically deduces  that by employing science for its defense, the Church admits the  impotence of \"divine revelation,\" in this age, to convince even its own  adherents of the problematical existence of a divine being. _Theology is  no longer recognized as authoritative even by theologians!_    Will the theologians now discard their theology based on the  supernatural, and build a system of theology based on science? Is this  all that is left to the theologian: that he must use the pitiful  \"Theology of Gaps\"? That is, wherever there are gaps in scientific  knowledge, the theologians insert their idea of God! This is but the  replacing of the question mark with a meaningless label.          CHAPTER V    THE PERSISTENCE OF RELIGION        _We believe what we believe, not because we have been convinced by      such and such arguments, but because we are of such and such a      disposition._        C. E. M. JOAD.          _The mind of the ordinary man is in so imperfect a condition that it      requires a creed; that is to say, a theory concerning the unknown      and the unknowable in which it may place its deluded faith and be at      rest._        WINWOOD READE.        _Generations followed and what had been offered as hypothetical      theological suppositions were through custom and tradition taken for      granted as unquestioned truth._        LLEWELYN POWYS.      The Martian has had his attention drawn to the statement that religion  in some form or other has existed from most primitive times down to the  present day. The theologians point to this as a proof of the existence  of a supreme being. An investigation of this assertion leads the Martian  to the conclusion that religions have continued to exist mainly because  of the power which inherited superstitions wield over mankind. Men are  born with a marked tendency towards superstitions.    Certain isolated families of men are born with an inherited tendency  towards tuberculosis. Most of these are born, not with an active  tuberculosis, but some as yet imperfectly understood tendency, a defect  in their protoplasmic make-up that renders them an easy prey to the  tubercle bacillus if they are exposed to it. Similarly, generations of  men have been born with a weakened mental vitality towards superstition;  a weakened mental capacity that renders their minds an easy prey to that  fear which manifests itself in superstition, creed, religion--the  God-idea. It was Karl Marx who remarked that, \"The tradition of all the  generations of the past weighs down like an Alp upon the brain of the  living.\"    Since the days of our racial childhood, our beliefs have been handed  down from generation to generation, and they have persisted since in all  ages it was forbidden to question their existence. Man has persuaded  himself that it is so just because he has said it for so long and so  often. The force of repetition is great; it is, in fact, taken by a vast  majority of men as the equivalent of proof.    Most men have to accept their religions ready made. Their daily tasks  leave them no time or opportunity for a personal search. The toil for  bread is incessant, there is not sufficient leisure to verify the  sources of their religious beliefs. Moreover, the ecclesiastic's answers  to the riddles of life are easier, by far, to grasp than the answers of  science. These two factors, of innate mental inertia and force of  repetition, are well manifested by the present tactics of advertising.  The manufacturer of any product well knows that constant repetition and  the dangling of his product before the eyes of the public will lead to a  widespread acceptance of the advertising slogans propounded for his  article.    The force of so-called authority has aggravated this mental inertia. It  takes a tremendous amount of will power and mental courage for any  individual to"]]]
