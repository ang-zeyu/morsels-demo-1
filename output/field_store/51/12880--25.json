The story of John Jay's second term is not all a record of success.  Strenuous statesmen, catching the contagion of excitement growing out  of the war news from France, formed themselves into clubs, made  eloquent addresses, and cheered John Adams and his readiness to fight  rather than pay tribute, while the Legislature, in extra session,  responded to Jay's patriotic appeal by unanimously pledging the  President the support of the State, and making appropriations for the  repair of fortifications and the purchase of munitions of war. From  all indications, the Federalists seemed certain to continue in power  for the next decade, since the more their opponents sympathised with  the French, the stronger became the sentiment against them. If ever  there was a period in the history of the United States when the  opposite party should have been encouraged to talk, and to talk loudly  and saucily, it was in the summer of 1798, when the American people  had waked up to the insulting treatment accorded their envoys in  France; but the Federalist leaders, horrified by the bloody record of  the French Revolution, seemed to cultivate an increasing distrust of  the common people, whom they now sought to repress by the historic  measures known as the Naturalisation Act of June 18, 1798, the Alien  Act of June 25, and the Sedition Act of July 14.    The briefest recital of the purpose of these laws is sufficient to  prove the folly of the administration that fathered them, and when one  considers the possible lengths to which an official, representing the  President, might go if instigated by private or party revenge, Edward  Livingston's declaration that they \"would have disgraced the age of  Gothic barbarity\" does not seem too strong.[87] Under the Alien Act  persons not citizens of the United States could be summarily banished  at the sole discretion of the President, without guilt or even  accusation, thus jeopardising the liberty and business of the most  peaceable and well-disposed foreigner. Under the Act of Sedition a  citizen could be dragged from his bed at night and taken hundreds of  miles from home to be tried for circulating a petition asking that  these laws be repealed. The intended effect was to weed out the  foreign-born and crush political opponents, and, the better to  accomplish this purpose, the Alien Act set aside trial by jury, and  the Sedition Act transferred prosecutions from state courts to federal  tribunals.    [Footnote 87: \"Let us not establish a tyranny,\" Hamilton wrote Oliver  Wolcott.--_Works of_, Vol. 8, p. 491. \"Let us not be cruel or  violent.\"--_Ibid._, 490. He thought the Alien Law deficient in  guarantees of personal liberty.--_Ibid._, 5, 26.]    Governor Jay approved these extreme measures because of alleged secret  combinations in the interest of the French; and, although no proof of  their existence appeared except in the unsupported statements of the  press, he submitted to the Legislature, in January, 1799, several  amendments to the Federal Constitution, proposed by Massachusetts,  increasing the disability of foreigners, and otherwise limiting their  rights to citizenship. The Legislature, still strongly Federal in both  its branches, did not take kindly to the amendments, and the Assembly  rejected them by the surprising vote of sixty-two to thirty-eight.  Then came up the famous Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. The  Virginia resolves, drafted by Madison and passed by the Virginia  Legislature, pronounced the Alien and Sedition laws \"palpable and  alarming infractions of the Constitution;\" the Kentucky resolutions,  drafted by Jefferson, declared each act to be \"not law, but altogether  void and of no force.\" This was nullification, and the States north of  the Potomac hastened to disavow any such doctrine, although the vote  in the New York Assembly came perilously near indorsing it.    The discussion of these measures gave opportunity for the public  opening of a great career in New York legislation--a career that was  to continue into the years made memorable by Martin Van Buren and  William L. Marcy. The record of New York party politics for forty  years is a record of long and brilliant contests in which Erastus  Root, if not a recognised party chieftain, was one of the ablest  lieutenants that marshalled on the field of combat. He was a man of  gigantic frame, scholarly and much given to letters, and, although  somewhat uncouth in manner and rough in speech, his forceful logic,  coupled with keen wit and biting sarcasm, made him a dreaded opponent  and a welcomed ally. He resembled Hamilton in his independence,  relying less upon organisation and more upon the strength of his  personality, yet shrewdly holding close relations with those whose  careful management and adroit manipulation of the spoils kept men in  line whatever the policy it seemed expedient to adopt. For eleven  years he served in the Assembly, and thrice became speaker; for eight  years he served in the Senate, and twice became its president; for  twelve years he served in the lower house of Congress, and once became  lieutenant-governor. Wherever he served, he was recognised as a  master, not always consistent, but always earnest, eloquent, and  popular, fighting relentlessly and tirelessly, and compelling respect  even when unsuccessful.    Just now Root was an ardent admirer of Aaron Burr and a bitter  opponent of Alexander Hamilton. He was only twenty-six years old.  During the contest over the Federal Constitution he was a leader in  boyish sports at his Connecticut home, thinking more of the next  wrestling match and the girl he should escort from the lyceum than of  the character of the constitution under which he should live; but he  came to the Assembly in 1798 a staunch supporter of republicanism,  believing that Federalists should give place to men inclined to trust  the people with larger power, and in this spirit he led the debate  against the Alien and Sedition laws with such brilliancy that he  leaped into prominence at a single bound. Freedom and fearlessness  characterised the work of this young orator, singling him out as the  people's champion, and giving him the confidence of five thousand  \"Wild Irishmen,\" as Otis called them, who had sought America as an  asylum for the oppressed of all nations. Unrestrained by precedent and  unruled by fear for the future, he spoke with confidence to a people  whom he delighted with the breadth and liberality of his views,  lifting them onto heights from which they had never before surveyed  their political rights.    In the debate in the Assembly on the indorsement of the Kentucky  resolutions Root maintained with great force the right of the people's  representatives in the Legislature to express an opinion upon an act  of Congress, however solemn, and he ridiculed the argument that  questions limited to the judiciary were beyond the jurisdiction of  any other body of men to criticise and condemn. This touched a popular  chord, and if the mere expression of an opinion by the Assembly had  been the real question at issue, young Root might have carried his  point as he did the fight against the amendments proposed by  Massachusetts. But there was one question Root did not successfully  meet. Although Jefferson's eighth and ninth resolutions--declaring  that whenever the general government assumed powers not delegated, \"a  nullification of the act is the rightful remedy\" of every State--had  been stricken out, the dangerous doctrine was still present in the  preamble, making it apparent to the friends of the Constitution that  the promulgation of such a monstrous heresy would be worse than the  acts sought to be annulled. It is not clear that Root's understanding  of these resolutions went so far; for the question discussed by him  concerned only the right of the Legislature to express an opinion  respecting the wisdom or unwisdom of an act of Congress. Nor does it  appear that he favoured what afterward became known as \"nullification;\"  for it is certain that when, thirty-four years later, the doctrine  came up again under John C. Calhoun's leadership, Erastus Root, then  in Congress, struck at it as he would at the head of a viper, becoming  the fearless expounder of principles which civil war permanently  established.    While young Root was leading the debate in the Assembly, Ambrose  Spencer led it in the Senate. Spencer's apostacy produced a profound  sensation in political circles. He had given no intimation of a change  of political principles. Although still a young man, barely  thirty-three, he had ranked among the foremost leaders of the  Federalist party, having been honoured as an assistant attorney-general,  a state senator, a member of the Council of Appointment, a friend of  Hamilton, and the confidential adviser of Jay. The latter's heart  might well sink within him to be abandoned by such a colleague at a  time when the stability of the Union was insidiously attacked; nor  ought Spencer to have been surprised that public rumour immediately  set to work to find some reason for his change less simple and less  honest, perhaps, than a dislike of the Federalist policy. Various  causes have been given for his mysterious behaviour. Some thought him  eager for a high mark of presidential favour, possibly a mission  abroad, which was not warmly advocated by Hamilton; others believed  that the bitter quarrel between Adams and Hamilton influenced him to  desert a sinking party; but the rumour generally accepted by the  Federalists ascribed it to his failure to become state comptroller in  place of Samuel Jones, an office which he sought. It was recalled that  shortly after Jones' appointment, Spencer raised the question, with  some show of bitterness,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#19)"],[1,"of Tenantship  was then accepted rather then they woulde continue in those generall  services and employments noe waye better then slavery. Most part of the  time that Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thos. Dale governed we were at warre  with the natives, so that by them divers times were many of our people  slaine, whose blood Sir Thomas Dale neglected not to revenge, by divers  and sundry executions, in killinge many, cuttinge downe and takinge away  their corne, burninge their houses, spoiling their weares, &c.[HH]    [HH] \"Their weares in which they take their fish, which are certain  enclosures made with reedes, and framed in the fashion of a laborinth or  maze, sett a fathome deepe in the water, with divers chambers or bedds,  out of which the entangled fish cannot returne or gett out, being once  in.\"--Strachey, p. 68.    In this time alsoe the two fortes, fort Henry and fort Charles, at  Kicoughton, were againe erected with such buildings as were formerly  expressed, not fortified at all against a forreine enemye, and against  the Indian that common order of a pale or pallisadoe.    The supplies sent out of Englande while Sir Thos. Gates and Sir Thos.  Dale governed were these; a small barque called the John and Francis,  which brought few men and less victual; the next a small ship called the  Sarah, with the like number of men and victuall; the next ship called  the Tresorer, wherin came Capt. Samuell Argoll, bringinge with him to  the number of fiftie good men, which ship and men were wholly imployed  in Trade and other services for relevinge of the Collonye; the next  ship, called the Elizabeth, with about thirteene persons, for them  little provision; the next the same Elizabeth came againe, with some  small store of provisions only; in her Sir Thos. Gates went for  Englande, leavinge the government with Sir Thomas Dale.    A little before the departure of Sir Thomas Gates many of the ancient  planters (by the instigation of Sir Thomas Dale), uppon the promise of  an absolute freedome after three yeares more to be expired (havinge most  of them already served the Collonye six or seaven yeares in that  generall slavery) were yet contented to worke in the buildinge of  Charles Citty and Hundred, with very little allowance of clothinge and  victuall, and that only for the first yeare, being promised one moneth  in the yeare, and one daye in the weeke from Maye daye till harvest, to  gett our maintenance out of the earth without any further helpe; which  promise of Sir Thos. Dale was not performed, for out of that small time  which was allowed for our maintenance we were abridged of nere halfe,  soe that out of our daily taskes we were forced to redeeme time wherin  to labour for our sustenance, therby miserably to purchase our freedome.  Yet so fell it out that our State (by God's mercy) was afterwardes more  happie then others who continued longer in the aforementioned slaverye;  in which time we built such houses as before and in them lived with  continual repairs, and buildinge new where the old failed, untill the  massacre.    For matter of fortification in all this time, were only foure peeces of  ordinance mounted for our defence against the natives. Soone after we  weare seated at Charles Hundred, Sir Thomas Dales resolved of a journey  to Pamonkey River, there to make with the Salvadges either a firme  league of friendship or a present warre; they percieving his intent  inclined rather for peace (more for feare then love) which was then  concluded betwixt them. That donne we retorned to our habitations, where  great want and scarcitye, oppressed us, that continuinge and  increasinge, (our first harvest not yet being ripe) caused in many an  intended mutinye, which beinge, by God's mercy, discovered, the prime  actors were duly examined and convicted, wherof sixe beinge adjudged and  condemned were executed.    After this, arrived for supply a small ship called the John and Francis,  with about twenty persons and little or noe provisions for them. The  next ship, called the Tresorer, arived heere with the number of twenty  persons and as little provisions as the former, in which ship after many  other designes were effected by Sir Thos. Dale, as makinge spoile of the  Keschiacks[II] and Wariscoyacks, impaling some necks of Lande, for  defence against the Salvadges, and in fishing for our reliefe, &c., he  departed from Virginia, and left the Government to Captain George  Yardley, under whom the Collony lived in peace and best plentye that  ever it had till that time, yet most part of the people for that yeare  of his Government continued in the generall services followinge their  labors as Sir Thos. Dale left them by order.    [II] Kiskiack (now Chescake--pronounced Cheesecake) on Smith's map is  located on the south side of the Pamunck (now York) river about the site  of Yorktown.--See Campbell, p. 66.  For Wariscoyack see footnote CC.    At Michaelmas followinge arrived a small ship called the Susan, her  lading (beinge the first Magazin) consistinge of some necessarye  provisions of clothinge, as our wants required, which goods were sould  by Sir Thos. Smith's factor, as we suppose, for a sufficient proffit,  exchanginge with us their commodities for our Tobacco.    At Christmas then followinge, just occasion beinge given by the Indians  of Chiquohomini in many and severall kindes of abuses, and in deridinge  of our demandes, wherunto they had formerly agreed and conditioned with  Sir Thomas Dale to paye us yearlye tribute, viz: a bushell of corne for  every Boweman, for which, by agreement, we were to give to each man one  peece of copper and one iron tomahawke, and to the eight chiefe men each  a suit of redd cloth, which clothes and truckinge stuffe we esteemed of  more worth then their corne. These and the like grosse abuses moved our  Governor, Captaine George Yeardley, to levye a company of men, to the  number of eighty-four, to bee revenged uppon those contemptuous Indians,  which he, accordinge to his desire, fully executed, and returned home  with the spoile of them; concludinge, before his departure from them, a  more firme league in appearance than formerly was, for that it continued  unviolated almost the space of two yeares; our people freely travelinge  from Town to Towne (both men, women and children) without any armes, and  were by the Salvadges lodged in their houses, every way kindly intreated  and noe way molested.    In March followinge, our three yeares' time beinge expired, as it was  our due, we of Charles Hundred demanded our long desired freedome from  that common and generall servitude; unto which request Captaine George  Yeardley, freely and willingly assented, to our great joy and comfort.  Yet remained the most part of the Collony in the former servitude; part  of whom were farmers, the rest imployed in such workes as Sir Thomas  Dale gave order for before his departure.    We that were freed, with our humble thankes to God, fell cheerfully to  our perticular labours, wherby to our great comfort, through his  blessinge, we reaped a plentifull harvest.    In May followinge arived Captain Samuell Argoll with commission to be  Governor. He brought with him to the number of a hundred persons, partly  at the charge of the Company and partly at the charge of private  adventurers; with them was brought a very little provision for that  nomber. At his arrival heere he founde the Collony in all parts well  stored with corne, and at Charles Hundred a granery well furnished by  rentes lately raised and received from the farmers, which corne he tooke  possession of, but how it was imployed himselfe can best give an  account. Whilest he governed, the Collony was slenderly provided of  munition, wherby a strict proclamation was made for restraint of  wastinge or shooting away of powder, under paine of great punishment;  which forbiddinge to shoot at all in our peeces caused the losse of much  of oure corne then growinge uppon the grounde; the Indians perceivinge  our forbearance to shoote (as formerly) concluded thereuppon that our  peeces were, as they saide, sicke and not to be used; uppon this, not  longe after they were boulde to presume to assault some of our people,  whom they slew, therin breakinge that league, which before was so fairly  kept.    Duringe his time of Government most of the people of the Collony  remained (as formerly) in the common service, their freedome not beinge  to be obtained without extraordinary payement.    The next ship that arrived heere was the George, sett forth, as we  supose, at the charge of private adventurers, but came soe meanly  provided with victuall, that had not we, the old Planters, relieved them  most of them had been starved. The next ships, called the Neptune and  Treasurer, arived in August followinge, set out at the charge of the  Right Hono^{ble} the Lord Laware, his noble associates, and some other  private adventurers. The people w^{ch} arived were soe poorely  victualled that had they not been distributed amongst the old Planters  they must for want have perished; with them was brought a most pestilent  disease (called the Bloody flux) which infected all most all the whole  Collonye. That disease, nothstanding all our former afflictions, was  never knowne before amongst us.    The next supply weare two ships called the William & Thomas and the  Guift, which arived in Januarie; the Guift beinge sett forth at the  charge of the Societie of Martin's Hundred, the other by the Magazin and  some private adventurers.    The next, a small ship called the Elinor (sett forth at whose charge we  know not), arived heere in Aprill after, and in her Capt. Samuell  Argoll, leaving his Government, shipt himselfe for Englande. Whatsoever  els befell in the time of his Government we omit to relate, much beinge,  uppon our oathes, alreadie sufficiently examined and our answers sent  for Englande.
