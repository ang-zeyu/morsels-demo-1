Is it not said that a pig-faced  female who dwells in Landanpur has a lover?\"    I was about to remark, my king! said the parrot, somewhat nettled, if  the aged virgin had not interrupted me, that as ugly women are more  vicious than handsome women, so they are most successful. \"We love the  pretty, we adore the plain,\" is a true saying amongst the worldly  wise. And why do we adore the plain? Because they seem to think less of  themselves than of us-a vital condition of adoration.    Jayashri made some conquests by the portion of good looks which she  possessed, more by her impudence, and most by her father's reputation  for riches. She was truly shameless, and never allowed herself fewer  than half a dozen admirers at the time. Her chief amusement was to  appoint interviews with them successively, at intervals so short that  she was obliged to hurry away one in order to make room for another. And  when a lover happened to be jealous, or ventured in any way to criticize  her arrangements, she replied at once by showing him the door. Answer  unanswerable!    When Jayashri had reached the ripe age of thirteen, the son of a  merchant, who was her father's gossip and neighbour, returned home after  a long sojourn in far lands, whither he had travelled in the search of  wealth. The poor wretch, whose name, by-the-bye, was Shridat (Gift of  Fortune), had loved her in her childhood; and he came back, as men  are apt to do after absence from familiar scenes, painfully full of  affection for house and home and all belonging to it. From his cross,  stingy old uncle to the snarling superannuated beast of a watchdog, he  viewed all with eyes of love and melting heart. He could not see that  his idol was greatly changed, and nowise for the better; that her nose  was broader and more club-like, her eyelids fatter and thicker, her  under lip more prominent, her voice harsher, and her manner coarser. He  did not notice that she was an adept in judging of men's dress, and that  she looked with admiration upon all swordsmen, especially upon those  who fought upon horses and elephants. The charm of memory, the  curious faculty of making past time present caused all he viewed to be  enchanting to him.    Having obtained her father's permission, Shridat applied for betrothal  to Jayashri, who with peculiar boldness, had resolved that no suitor  should come to her through her parent. And she, after leading him on by  all the coquetries of which she was a mistress, refused to marry him,  saying that she liked him as a friend, but would hate him as a husband.    You see, my king! there are three several states of feeling with which  women regard their masters, and these are love, hate, and indifference.  Of all, love is the weakest and the most transient, because the  essentially unstable creatures naturally fall out of it as readily as  they fall into it. Hate being a sister excitement will easily become,  if a man has wit enough to effect the change, love; and hate-love  may perhaps last a little longer than love-love. Also, man has the  occupation, the excitement, and the pleasure of bringing about the  change. As regards the neutral state, that poet was not happy in his  ideas who sang--                   Whene'er indifference appears, or scorn,                 Then, man, despair! then, hapless lover, mourn!    For a man versed in the Lila Shastra[78] can soon turn a woman's  indifference into hate, which I have shown is as easily permuted to  love. In which predicament it is the old thing over again, and it ends  in the pure Asat[79] or nonentity.    \"Which of these two birds, the jay or the parrot, had dipped deeper into  human nature, mighty King Vikram?\" asked the demon in a wheedling tone  of voice.    The trap was this time set too openly, even for the royal personage,  to fall into it. He hurried on, calling to his son, and not answering a  word. The Vampire therefore resumed the thread of his story at the place  where he had broken it off.    Shridat was in despair when he heard the resolve of his idol. He thought  of drowning himself, of throwing himself down from the summit of Mount  Girnar,[80] of becoming a religious beggar; in short, of a multitude  of follies. But he refrained from all such heroic remedies for despair,  having rightly judged, when he became somewhat calmer, that they would  not be likely to further his suit. He discovered that patience is  a virtue, and he resolved impatiently enough to practice it. And by  perseverance he succeeded. The worse for him! How vain are men to wish!  How wise is the Deity, who is deaf to their wishes!    Jayashri, for potent reasons best known to herself, was married to  Shridat six months after his return home. He was in raptures. He called  himself the happiest man in existence. He thanked and sacrificed to the  Bhagwan for listening to his prayers. He recalled to mind with thrilling  heart the long years which he had spent in hopeless exile from all that  was dear to him, his sadness and anxiety, his hopes and joys, his toils  and troubles his loyal love and his vows to Heaven for the happiness of  his idol, and for the furtherance of his fondest desires.    For truly he loved her, continued the parrot, and there is something  holy in such love. It becomes not only a faith, but the best of  faiths-an abnegation of self which emancipates the spirit from its  straightest and earthliest bondage, the \"I\"; the first step in the  regions of heaven; a homage rendered through the creature to the  Creator; a devotion solid, practical, ardent, not as worship mostly is,  a cold and lifeless abstraction; a merging of human nature into one far  nobler and higher the spiritual existence of the supernal world. For  perfect love is perfect happiness, and the only perfection of man; and  what is a demon but a being without love? And what makes man's love  truly divine, is the fact that it is bestowed upon such a thing as  woman.    \"And now, Raja Vikram,\" said the Vampire, speaking in his proper person,  \"I have given you Madanmanjari the jay's and Churaman the parrot's  definitions of the tender passion, or rather their descriptions of its  effects. Kindly observe that I am far from accepting either one or the  other. Love is, according to me, somewhat akin to mania, a temporary  condition of selfishness, a transient confusion of identity. It enables  man to predicate of others who are his other selves, that which he is  ashamed to say about his real self. I will suppose the beloved object to  be ugly, stupid, vicious, perverse, selfish, low minded, or the reverse;  man finds it charming by the same rule that makes his faults and foibles  dearer to him than all the virtues and good qualities of his neighbours.  Ye call love a spell, an alchemy, a deity. Why? Because it deifies self  by gratifying all man's pride, man's vanity, and man's conceit, under  the mask of complete unegotism. Who is not in heaven when he is talking  of himself? and, prithee, of what else consists all the talk of lovers?\"    It is astonishing that the warrior king allowed this speech to last  as long as it did. He hated nothing so fiercely, now that he was in  middle-age, as any long mention of the \"handsome god.[81]\" Having vainly  endeavoured to stop by angry mutterings the course of the Baital's  eloquence, he stepped out so vigorously and so rudely shook that  inveterate talker, that the latter once or twice nearly bit off the tip  of his tongue. Then the Vampire became silent, and Vikram relapsed into  a walk which allowed the tale to be resumed.    Jayashri immediately conceived a strong dislike for her husband, and  simultaneously a fierce affection for a reprobate who before had been  indifferent to her. The more lovingly Shridat behaved to her, the more  vexed end annoyed she was. When her friends talked to her, she turned up  her nose, raising her eyebrows (in token of displeasure), and remained  silent. When her husband spoke words of affection to her, she found them  disagreeable, and turning away her face, reclined on the bed. Then he  brought dresses and ornaments of various kinds and presented them to  her, saying, \"Wear these.\" Whereupon she would become more angry,  knit her brows, turn her face away, and in an audible whisper call him  \"fool.\" All day she stayed out of the house, saying to her companions,  \"Sisters, my youth is passing away, and I have not, up to the present  time, tasted any of this world's pleasures.\" Then she would ascend to  the balcony, peep through the lattice, and seeing the reprobate going  along, she would cry to her friend, \"Bring that person to me.\" All night  she tossed and turned from side to side, reflecting in her heart, \"I  am puzzled in my mind what I shall say, and whither I shall go. I have  forgotten sleep, hunger, and thirst; neither heat nor cold is refreshing  to me.\"    At last, unable any longer to support the separation from her reprobate  paramour, whom she adored, she resolved to fly with him. On one  occasion, when she thought that her husband was fast asleep, she rose up  quietly, and leaving him, made her way fearlessly in the dark night  to her lover's abode. A footpad, who saw her on the way, thought to  himself, \"Where can this woman, clothed in jewels, be going alone at  midnight?\" And thus he followed her unseen, and watched her.    When Jayashri reached the intended place, she went into the house, and  found her lover lying at the door. He was dead, having been stabbed by  the footpad; but she, thinking that he had, according to custom, drunk  intoxicating hemp, sat upon the floor, and raising his head, placed it  tenderly in her lap. Then, burning with the fire of separation from  him, she began to kiss his cheeks, and to fondle and caress him with the  utmost freedom and affection.

The ancients, believing  that sterility was more common with couples of the same temperament and  condition, advised, with Hippocrates, that blonde women should unite  with dark men, thin women with stout men, and _vice versa._    Barren women should not despair. They sometimes become fecund after a  long lapse of years. In other words, they are sterile only during a  certain period of their lives, and then, a change occurring in their  temperament with age, they become fruitful. History affords a striking  example of this eccentricity of generation, in the birth of Louis XIV.,  whom Anne of Austria, Queen of France brought into the world after a  sterility of twenty-two years. Catherine de Medicis, wife of Henry II.,  became the mother of ten children after a sterility of ten years. Dr.  Tilt, of London, mentions the case of a woman who was married at  eighteen, but although both herself and her husband enjoyed habitual  good health, conception did not take place until she was forty-eight,  when she bore a child. Another case is reported where a well-formed  female married at nineteen, and did not bear a child until she had  reached her fiftieth year.    Families often suffer from the effects of sterility. Civilised nations  never do. Recent researches have been carefully instituted in several  countries to determine the exact power of the human race to preserve its  numbers against the ravages of death. It has been ascertained that  during periods of peace the population can be maintained to the same  point by the additions made to it through the procreating capacity of  only one-half of the women in the community. Nature, therefore, has made  ample provision for preventing a decrease of population through failure  of reproduction.    She has also instituted laws to prevent its undue increase. It would  seem as if the extension of material mental and social comfort and  culture has a tendency to render marriage less prolific, and population  stationary or nearly so. So evident is this tendency, that it has been  laid down as a maxim in sociology by Sismondi, that 'where the number of  marriages is proportionally the greatest, where the greatest number of  persons participate in the duties and the virtues and the happiness of  marriage, the smaller number of children does each marriage produce.'  Thus, to a certain extent, does nature endorse the opinions of those  political economists who assert that increase of population beyond  certain limits is an evil happily averted by wars, famines, and  pestilences, which hence become national blessings in disguise. She,  however, points to the extension of mental and moral education and  refinement as gentler and surer means of reducing plethoric population  than those suggested by Malthus and Mill.    Many causes of sterility, it will therefore be seen, are beyond the  power of man to control. They operate on a large scale for the good of  the whole. With these we have little concern. But there are others which  may be influenced by intelligent endeavor. Some have been already  alluded to, and the remedy suggested; but we will proceed to give more  specific      ADVICE TO WIVES WHO DESIRE TO HAVE CHILDREN.    It has long been known that menstruation presents a group of phenomena  closely allied to fecundity. The first eruption of the menses is an  unequivocal sign of the awakening of the faculty of reproduction. The  cessation of the menstrual epochs is a sign equally certain of the loss  of the faculty of reproduction. When conception has taken place, the  periodical flow is interrupted. Labor occurs at about the time in which  the menses would have appeared. In short, it is a fact, now completely  established, that the time immediately before, and particularly that  after the monthly sickness, is the period the most favorable to  fecundation. It is said that, by following the counsel to this effect  given him by the celebrated Fernel, Henry II., the King of France,  secured to himself offspring after the long sterility of his wife before  referred to. Professor Bedford, of New York, says that he can point to  more than one instance in which, by this advice, he has succeeded in  adding to the happiness of parties who for years had been vainly hoping  for the accomplishment of their wishes.    Repose of the woman, and, above all, sojourn on the bed after the act of  generation, also facilitates conception. Hippocrates, the great father  of medicine, was aware of this, and laid stress upon it in his advice to  sterile wives.    The womb and the breasts are bound together by very strong sympathies:  that which excites the one will stimulate the other. Dr. Charles Loudon  mentions that four out of seven patients, by acting on this hint, became  mothers. A similar idea occurred to the illustrious Marshall Hall, who  advised the application of a strong infant to the breast. Fomentations  of warm milk to the breasts and the corresponding portion of the spinal  column, and the use of the breast-pump two or three times a day, just  before the menstrual period, have also been recommended by good medical  authorities. Horseback exercise, carried to fatigue, seems occasionally  to have conduced to pregnancy.    The greatest hope of success against sterility is to change the dominant  state of the constitution. But this can only be effected under suitable  medical advice. The treatment of sterility--thanks to the recent  researches of Dr. Marion Sims--is much more certain than formerly; and  the intelligent physician is now able to ascertain the cause, and point  out the remedy, where before all was conjecture and experiment. The  sterile wife should, herefore, be slow in abandoning all hope of ever  becoming a mother.      ON THE LIMITATION OF OFFSPRING.    No part of our subject is more delicate than this. Very few people are  willing to listen to a dispassionate discussion of the propriety or  impropriety of limiting within certain bounds the number of children in  a family. On the one side are many worthy physicians and pious  clergymen, who, without listening to any arguments, condemn every effort  to avoid large families; on the other, are numberless wives and  husbands, who turn a deaf ear to the warnings of doctors and the  thunders of divines, and, eager to escape a responsibility they have  assumed, hesitate not to resort to the most dangerous and immoral means  to accomplish this end.    We ask both parties to lay aside prejudice and prepossession, and  examine with us this most important social question in all its bearings.    Let us first inquire whether there is such a thing as  _over-production_--having _too many_ children. Unquestionably there is.  Its disastrous effects on both mother and children are known to every  intelligent physician. Two-thirds of all cases of womb disease, says Dr.  Tilt, are traceable to child-bearing in feeble women. Hardly a day  passes that a physician in large practice does not see instances of  debility and disease resulting from over-much child-bearing. Even the  lower animals illustrate this. Every farmer is aware of the necessity of  limiting the offspring of his mares and cows. How much more severe are  the injuries inflicted on the delicate organization of woman! A very  great mortality, says Dr. Duncan of Edinburgh, attends upon  confinements when they become too frequent.    The evils of a too rapid succession of pregnancies are likewise  conspicuous in the children. There is no more frequent cause, says Dr.  Hillier,--whose authority in such matters none will dispute,--of rickets  than this. Puny, sickly, short-lived offspring follows over-production.  Worse than this, the carefully compiled statistics of Scotland show that  such children are peculiarly liable to idiocy. Adding to an already  excessive number, they come to over-burden a mother already overwhelmed  with progeny. They cannot receive at her hands the attention they  require. Weakly herself, she brings forth weakly infants. 'Thus,'  concludes Dr. Duncan, 'are the accumulated evils of an excessive family  manifest.'    Apart from these considerations, there are certain social relations  which have been thought by some to advise small families. When either  parent suffers from a disease which is transmissible, and wishes to  avoid inflicting misery on an unborn generation, it has been urged that  they should avoid children. Such diseases not unfrequently manifest  themselves after marriage, which is answer enough to the objection that  if they did not wish children they should not marry. There are also  women to whom pregnancy is a nine months' torture, and others to whom it  is nearly certain to prove fatal. Such a condition cannot be discovered  before marriage, and therefore cannot be provided against by a single  life. Can such women be asked to immolate themselves?    It is strange, says that distinguished writer, John Stuart Mill, that  intemperance in drink, or in any other appetite, should be condemned so  readily, but that incontinence in this respect should always meet not  only with indulgence but praise. 'Little improvement' he adds, 'can be  expected in morality until the producing too large families is regarded  with the same feeling as drunkenness, or any other physical excess.' A  well-known medical writer, Dr. Drysdale, in commenting on these words,  adds: 'In this error, if error it be, I also humbly share.'    'When dangerous prejudices,' says Sismondi, the learned historian of  southern Europe, 'have not become accredited, when our true duties  towards those to whom we give life are not obscured in the name of a  sacred authority, no married man will have more children than he can  bring up properly.'    Such is the language of physicians and statesmen; but a stronger appeal  has been made for the sake of morality itself. The"]]]
