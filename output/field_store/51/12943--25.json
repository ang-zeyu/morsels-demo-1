These works contain all the       easily-accessible information respecting the reigns of       Edward and Mary, which is important.          CHAPTER VI.    ELIZABETH.      Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VIII., by Anne Boleyn, was in her  twenty-sixth year when she ascended the throne. She was crowned the  15th of June, 1559, and soon assembled her parliament and selected her  ministers. After establishing her own legitimacy, she set about  settling the affairs of the church, but only restored the Protestant  religion as Cranmer had left it. Indeed, she ever retained a fondness  for ceremonial, and abhorred a reform spirit among the people. She  insisted on her supremacy, as head of the church, and on conformity  with her royal conscience. But she was not severe on the Catholics,  and even the gluttonous and vindictive Bonner was permitted to end his  days in peace.    As soon as the Protestant religion was established, the queen turned  her attention towards Scotland, from which much trouble was expected.    [Sidenote: Mary, Queen of Scots.]    Scotland was then governed by Mary, daughter of James V., and had  succeeded her father while a mere infant, eight days after her birth,  (1542.) In 1558, she married the dauphin, afterwards King of France,  by which marriage she was Queen of France as well as of Scotland.    [Sidenote: John Knox.]    According to every canonical law of the Roman church, the claim of  Mary Stuart to the English throne was preferable to that of her cousin  Elizabeth. Her uncles, the Guises, represented that Anne Boleyn's  marriage had never been lawful, and that Elizabeth was therefore  illegitimate. In an evil hour, she and her husband quartered the arms  of England with their own, and assumed the titles of King and Queen of  Scotland and England. And Elizabeth's indignation was further excited  by the insult which the pope had inflicted, in declaring her birth  illegitimate. She, therefore, resolved to gratify, at once, both her  ambition and her vengeance, encouraged by her ministers, who wished to  advance the Protestant interest in the kingdom. Accordingly,  Elizabeth, with consummate art, undermined the authority of Mary in  Scotland, now distracted by religious as well as civil commotions.  Mary was a Catholic, and had a perfect abhorrence and disgust of the  opinions and customs of the reformers, especially of John Knox, whose  influence in Scotland was almost druidical. The Catholics resolved to  punish with fire and sword, while the Protestants were equally intent  on defending themselves with the sword. And it so happened that some  of the most powerful of the nobility were arrayed on the side of  Protestantism. But the Scotch reformers were animated with a zeal  unknown to Cranmer and his associates. The leaders had been trained at  Geneva, under the guidance of Calvin, and had imbibed his opinions,  and were, therefore, resolved to carry the work of reform after the  model of the Genevan church. Accordingly, those pictures, and statues,  and ornaments, and painted glass, and cathedrals, which Cranmer  spared, were furiously destroyed by the Scotch reformers, who  considered them as parts of an idolatrous worship. The antipathy to  bishops and clerical vestments was equally strong, and a sweeping  reform was carried on under the dictatorship of Knox. Elizabeth had no  more sympathy with this bold, but uncouth, reformer and his movements,  than had Mary herself, and never could forgive him for his book,  written at Geneva, aimed against female government, called the \"First  Blast of a Trumpet against the monstrous Regiment of Women.\" But Knox  cared not for either the English or the Scottish queens, and zealously  and fearlessly prosecuted his work, and gained over to his side the  moral strength of the kingdom. Of course, a Catholic queen resolved to  suppress his doctrines; but nearly the whole Scottish nobility rallied  around his standard, marching with the Bible in one hand, and the  sword in the other. The queen brought in troops from France to support  her insulted and tottering government, which only increased the zeal  of the Protestant party, headed by the Earls of Argyle, Arran, Morton,  and Glencairn, and James Stuart, Prior of St. Andrews, who styled  themselves \"Lords of the Congregation.\" A civil war now raged in  Scotland, between the queen regent, who wished to suppress the  national independence, and extinguish the Protestant religion, and the  Protestants, who comprised a great part of the nation, and who were  resolved on the utter extirpation of Romanism and the limitation of  the regal power. The Lords of the Congregation implored the aid of  England, which Elizabeth was ready to grant, both from political and  religious motives. The Protestant cause was in the ascendant, when the  queen regent died, in 1560. The same year died Francis II., of France;  and Mary, now a widow, resolved to return to her own kingdom. She  landed at Leith, August, 1561, and was received with the grandest  demonstration of joy. For a time, affairs were tolerably tranquil,  Mary having intrusted the great Protestant nobles with power. She was  greatly annoyed, however, by Knox, who did not treat her with the  respect due to a queen, and who called her Jezebel; but the reformer  escaped punishment on account of his great power.    [Sidenote: Marriage of Mary--Darnley.]    In 1565, Mary married her cousin, Lord Darnley, son of the Earl of  Lennox,--a match exceedingly distasteful to Elizabeth, who was ever  jealous of Mary, especially in matrimonial matters, since the Scottish  queen had not renounced her pretensions to the throne of her  grandfather, Henry VII. The character of Elizabeth now appears in its  worst light; and meanness and jealousy took the place of that  magnanimity which her admirers have ascribed to her. She fomented  disturbances in Scotland, and incited the queen's natural brother, the  Prior of St. Andrews, now Earl of Murray, to rebellion, with the  expectation of obtaining the government of the country. He formed a  conspiracy to seize the persons of Mary and her husband. The plot was  discovered, and Murray fled to England; but it was still unremittingly  pursued, till at length it was accomplished.    Darnley, the consort of Mary, was a man of low tastes, profligate  habits, and shallow understanding. Such a man could not long retain  the affections of the most accomplished woman of her age, accustomed  to flattery, and bent on pursuing her own pleasure, at any cost.  Disgust and coldness therefore took place. Darnley, enraged at this  increasing coldness, was taught to believe that he was supplanted in  the queen's affections by an Italian favorite, the musician Rizzio,  whom Mary had made her secretary. He therefore signed a bond, with  certain lords, for the murder of the Italian, who seems to have been a  man of no character. One evening, as the queen was at supper, in her  private apartment, with the countess of Argyle and Rizzio, the Earl of  Morton, with one hundred and sixty men, took possession of the palace  of Holyrood, while Darnley himself showed the way to a band of  ruffians to the royal presence. Rizzio was barbarously murdered in the  presence of the queen, who endeavored to protect him.    Darnley, in thus perpetrating this shocking murder, was but the tool  of some of the great lords, who wished to make him hateful to the  queen, and to the nation, and thus prepare the way for his own  execution. And they succeeded. A plot was contrived for the murder of  Darnley, of which Murray was probably the author. Shortly after, the  house, in which he slept, was blown up by gunpowder, in the middle of  the night.    [Sidenote: Bothwell--Civil War in Scotland.]    The public voice imputed to the Earl of Bothwell, a great favorite of  the queen, the murder of Darnley. Nor did the queen herself escape  suspicion. \"But no inquiry or research,\" says Scott, \"has ever been  able to bring us either to that clear opinion upon the guilt of Mary  which is expressed by many authors, or guide us to that triumphant  conclusion in favor of her innocence of all accession, direct or  tacit, to the death of her husband, which others have maintained with  the same obstinacy.\" But whatever doubt exists as to the queen's  guilt, there is none respecting her ministers--Maitland, Huntley,  Morton, and Argyle. Still they offered a reward of two thousand pounds  for the discovery of the murderers. The public voice accused Bothwell  as the principal: and yet the ministers associated with him, and the  queen, entirely exculpated him. He was brought to a trial, on the  formal accusation of the Earl of Lennox, in the city of Edinburgh,  which he was permitted to obtain possession of. In a place guarded by  his own followers, it was not safe for any witnesses to appear against  him, and he was therefore acquitted, though the whole nation believed  him guilty.    Mary was rash enough to marry, shortly after, the man whom public  opinion pronounced to be the murderer of her husband; and Murray, her  brother, was so ambitious and treacherous, as to favor the marriage,  with the hope that the unpopularity of the act would lead to the  destruction of the queen, and place him at the helm of state. No  sooner was Mary married to Bothwell, than Murray and other lords threw  off the mask, pretended to be terribly indignant, took up arms against  the queen, with the view of making her prisoner, and with the pretence  of delivering her from her husband. Bothwell escaped to Norway, and  the queen surrendered herself, at Carberry Hill, to the insurgent  army, the chiefs of which instantly assumed the reins of government,  and confined the queen in the castle of Lochleven, and treated her  with excessive harshness. Shortly after, (1567,) she resigned her  crown to her infant son, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#19)"],[1,"exclusion of men. When Christianity spread through the district  the inhabitants would still cling to their old custom and their old  myth, as we know was done elsewhere, because it was bound up with their  social life. But, if not violently put down by the rulers of the land,  both custom and myth would, little by little, lose their sacred  character as the new religion increased in influence, and would become  transformed into municipal ceremonies. This process would be slow,  centuries being required for its completion; but it would be aided by  the gradual development of the tribe first into a settled village  community, and thence into a mediaeval township. With the loss of  sanctity the reason for prohibiting the attendance of men would vanish;  but the tradition of it would be preserved in the incident of the story  which narrated Peeping Tom's treachery.[59]      FOOTNOTES:    [33] Mrs. Bray, vol. i. p. 174.

This entry is an interpolation in a list of mayors  and sheriffs in a different handwriting. There are several such  interpolations in the volume. Coventry possesses a number of MS. volumes  of annals, one of which (see below) seems to date from the latter part  of the sixteenth century, and the rest from the latter part of the  seventeenth. In the MS. marked F. (considered by Mr. W. G. Fretton,  F.S.A., to be in the handwriting of John Tipper, of Bablake, Coventry, a  schoolmaster and local antiquary at the end of the seventeenth and  beginning of the eighteenth centuries), and also in the MS. in the  British Museum (Additional MSS. 11,364), the entry runs simply:--\"1678  Michaell Earle (Mercer) Mayor; Francis Clark, George Allatt, Sherriffs.  This year y^e severall Companies had new streamers, and attended y^e  Mayor to proclaim y^e faire, and each company cloathed one boy or two to  augment y^e show.\" The latter MS. elsewhere speaks of the story of  Godiva's ride as \"comonly known, and yearly comemorated by the Mayor,  Aldermen, and y^e severall companies.\"    [47] This statue used to be decked out on the occasion of the procession  in the long peruke and neckcloth of the reign of Charles II.

A careful examination  of the language of Roger of Wendover, Matthew Paris, John of Brompton,  and Matthew of Westminster, shows that Roger of Wendover's account is  the source of the other three, Matthew Paris copying most closely, and  John of Brompton most freely. John of Brompton and Matthew of  Westminster omit the escort. Their statement as to Godiva's being unseen  refers to the hair which covered her; and the latter informs us, with a  touch of rhetoric, that Leofric regarded it as a miracle.    [49] Rudder, p. 307.

A new-born babe, of all human beings the most helpless, has always  roused compassion and care. Nor is it a matter for wonder if its  helplessness against physical dangers have led to the assumption that it  is exposed to spiritual or supernatural evils more than its elders. At  all events it seems a widespread superstition that a babe, when first it  makes its appearance in this world, must be protected not merely against  the natural perils of its condition, but also against enemies of an even  more subtle and fearful description. The shape taken by this  superstition in north-western Europe is the belief in Changelings--a  belief which I propose to examine in the present chapter.[60]    By the belief in changelings I mean a belief that fairies and other  imaginary beings are on the watch for young children, or (as we shall  see hereafter) sometimes even for adults, that they may, if they can  find them unguarded, seize and carry them off, leaving in their place  one of themselves, or a block of wood animated by their enchantments and  made to resemble the stolen person. Wise mothers take precautions  against such thefts. These precautions are tolerably simple, and for the  most part display the same general character. First and foremost among  them is the rite of baptism, whereby the little one is admitted into the  Christian Church. Faith in the efficacy of baptism as a protection from  the powers hostile to man is not less strong among communities nominally  Protestant than among Roman Catholics, and has doubtless operated to  bring many children within the pale of the visible Church who might  otherwise have been long in reaching that sacred enclosure. Examples of  the belief in the power of baptism against the depredations of fairies  could easily be cited from all Protestant countries. Without doing this,  we may just pause to note that baptism was also reckoned a remedy for  disease. This is doubtless a relic of the old creed which refers all  human ailments to witchcraft and other spiritualistic origins. Mr.  Henderson, speaking of the notion prevalent in the north of England that  sickly infants never thrive until they are christened, relates a story  communicated to him by a clergyman, within whose personal knowledge it  had happened. He says: \"The infant child of a chimney-sweeper at Thorne,  in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was in a very weak state of health, and  appeared to be pining away. A neighbour looked in, and inquired if the  child had been baptized. On an answer being given in the negative, she  gravely said, 'I would"]]]
