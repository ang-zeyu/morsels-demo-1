Holley opened his lips to speak, hesitated, looked away from Bostil,  and finally said, \"No, it sure ain't.\" Then he turned and walked away,  head bent in sober thought. Bostil came toward the open door where Lucy  stood. He looked somber. At her greeting he seemed startled.    \"What?\" he said.    \"I just said, 'Hello, Dad,'\" she replied, demurely. Yet she  thoughtfully studied her father's dark face.    \"Hello yourself.... Did you know Van got throwed an' hurt?\"    \"Yes.\"    Bostil swore under his breath. \"There ain't any riders on the range  thet can be trusted,\" he said, disgustedly. \"They're all the same. They  like to get in a bunch an' jeer each other an' bet. They want MEAN  hosses. They make good hosses buck. They haven't any use for a hoss  thet won't buck. They all want to give a hoss a rakin' over.... Think  of thet fool Van gettin' throwed by a two-dollar Ute mustang. An' hurt  so he can't ride for days! With them races comin' soon! It makes me  sick.\"    \"Dad, weren't you a rider once?\" asked Lucy.    \"I never was thet kind.\"    \"Van will be all right in a few days.\"    \"No matter. It's bad business. If I had any other rider who could  handle the King I'd let Van go.\"    \"I can get just as much out of the King as Van can,\" said Lucy,  spiritedly.    \"You!\" exclaimed Bostil. But there was pride in his glance.    \"I know I can.\"    \"You never had any use for Sage King,\" said Bostil, as if he had been  wronged.    \"I love the King a little, and hate him a lot,\" laughed Lucy.    \"Wal, I might let you ride at thet, if Van ain't in shape,\" rejoined  her father.    \"I wouldn't ride him in the race. But I'll keep him in fine fettle.\"    \"I'll bet you'd like to see Sarch beat him,\" said Bostil, jealously.    \"Sure I would,\" replied Lucy, teasingly. \"But, Dad, I'm afraid Sarch  never will beat him.\"    Bostil grunted. \"See here. I don't want any weight up on the King. You  take him out for a few days. An' ride him! Savvy thet?\"    \"Yes, Dad.\"    \"Give him miles an' miles--an' then comin' home, on good trails, ride  him for all your worth.... Now, Lucy, keep your eye open. Don't let any  one get near you on the sage.\"    \"I won't.... Dad, do you still worry about poor Joel Creech?\"    \"Not Joel. But I'd rather lose all my stock then have Cordts or Dick  Sears get within a mile of you.\"    \"A mile!\" exclaimed Lucy, lightly, though a fleeting shade crossed her  face. \"Why, I'd run away from him, if I was on the King, even if he got  within ten yards of me.\"    \"A mile is close enough, my daughter,\" replied Bostil. \"Don't ever  forget to keep your eye open. Cordts has sworn thet if he can't steal  the King he'll get you.\"    \"Oh! he prefers the horse to me.\"    \"Wal, Lucy, I've a sneakin' idea thet Cordts will never leave the  uplands unless he gets you an' the King both.\"    \"And, Dad--you consented to let that horse-thief come to our races?\"  exclaimed Lucy, with heat.    \"Why not? He can't do any harm. If he or his men get uppish, the worse  for them. Cordts gave his word not to turn a trick till after the  races.\"    \"Do you trust him?\"    \"Yes. But his men might break loose, away from his sight. Especially  thet Dick Sears. He's a bad man. So be watchful whenever you ride out.\"    As Lucy went down toward the corrals she was thinking deeply. She could  always tell, woman-like, when her father was excited or agitated. She  remembered the conversation between him and Creech's rider. She  remembered the keen glance old Holley had bent upon him. And mostly she  remembered the somber look upon his face. She did not like that. Once,  when a little girl, she had seen it and never forgotten it, nor the  thing that it was associated with--something tragical which had  happened in the big room. There had been loud, angry voices of men--and  shots--and then the men carried out a long form covered with a blanket.  She loved her father, but there was a side to him she feared. And  somehow related to that side was his hardness toward Creech and his  intolerance of any rider owning a fast horse and his obsession in  regard to his own racers. Lucy had often tantalized her father with the  joke that if it ever came to a choice between her and his favorites  they would come first. But was it any longer a joke? Lucy felt that she  had left childhood behind with its fun and fancies, and she had begun  to look at life thoughtfully.    Sight of the corrals, however, and of the King prancing around, drove  serious thoughts away. There were riders there, among them Farlane, and  they all had pleasant greetings for her.    \"Farlane, Dad says I'm to take out Sage King,\" announced Lucy.    \"No!\" ejaculated Farlane, as he pocketed his pipe.    \"Sure. And I'm to RIDE him. You know how Dad means that.\"    \"Wal, now, I'm doggoned!\" added Farlane, looking worried and pleased at  once. \"I reckon, Miss Lucy, you--you wouldn't fool me?\"    \"Why, Farlane!\" returned Lucy, reproachfully. \"Did I ever do a single  thing around horses that you didn't want me to?\"    Farlane rubbed his chin beard somewhat dubiously. \"Wal, Miss Lucy, not  exactly while you was around the hosses. But I reckon when you onct got  up, you've sorta forgot a few times.\"    All the riders laughed, and Lucy joined them.    \"I'm safe when I'm up, you know that,\" she replied.    They brought out the gray, and after the manner of riders who had the  care of a great horse and loved him, they curried and combed and rubbed  him before saddling him.    \"Reckon you'd better ride Van's saddle,\" suggested Farlane. \"Them races  is close now, an' a strange saddle--\"    \"Of course. Don't change anything he's used to, except the stirrups,\"  replied Lucy.    Despite her antipathy toward Sage King, Lucy could not gaze at him  without all a rider's glory in a horse. He was sleek, so graceful, so  racy, so near the soft gray of the sage, so beautiful in build and  action. Then he was the kind of a horse that did not have to be  eternally watched. He was spirited and full of life, eager to run, but  when Farlane called for him to stand still he obeyed. He was the kind  of a horse that a child could have played around in safety. He never  kicked. He never bit. He never bolted. It was splendid to see him with  Farlane or with Bostil. He did not like Lucy very well, a fact that  perhaps accounted for Lucy's antipathy. For that matter, he did not  like any woman. If he had a bad trait, it came out when Van rode him,  but all the riders, and Bostil, too, claimed that Van was to blame for  that.    \"Thar, I reckon them stirrups is right,\" declared Farlane. \"Now, Miss  Lucy, hold him tight till he wears off thet edge. He needs work.\"    Sage King would not kneel for Lucy as Sarchedon did, and he was too  high for her to mount from the ground, so she mounted from a rock. She  took to the road, and then the first trail into the sage, intending to  trot him ten or fifteen miles down into the valley, and give him some  fast, warm work on the return.    The day was early in May and promised to grow hot. There was not a  cloud in the blue sky. The wind, laden with the breath of sage, blew  briskly from the west. All before Lucy lay the vast valley, gray and  dusky gray, then blue, then purple where the monuments stood, and,  farther still, dark ramparts of rock. Lucy had a habit of dreaming  while on horseback, a habit all the riders had tried to break, but she  did not give it rein while she rode Sarchedon, and assuredly now, up on  the King, she never forgot him for an instant. He shied at mockingbirds  and pack-rats and blowing blossoms and even at butterflies; and he did  it, Lucy thought, just because he was full of mischief. Sage King had  been known to go steady when there had been reason to shy. He did not  like Lucy and he chose to torment her. Finally he earned a good dig  from a spur, and then, with swift pounding of hoofs, he plunged and  veered and danced in the sage. Lucy kept her temper, which was what  most riders did not do, and by patience and firmness pulled Sage King  out of his prancing back into the trail. He was not the least  cross-grained, and, having had his little spurt, he settled down into  easy going.    In an hour Lucy was ten miles or more from home, and farther down in  the valley than she had ever been. In fact, she had never before been  down the long slope to the valley floor. How changed the horizon  became! The monuments loomed up now, dark, sentinel-like, and strange.  The first one, a great red rock, seemed to her some five miles away. It  was lofty, straight-sided, with a green slope at its base. And beyond  that the other monuments stretched out down the valley. Lucy decided to  ride as far as the first one before turning back. Always these  monuments had fascinated her, and this was her opportunity to ride near  one. How lofty they were, how wonderfully colored, and how comely!    Presently, over the left, where the monuments were thicker, and  gradually merged their slopes and lines and bulk into the yellow walls,  she saw low, drifting clouds of smoke.    \"Well, what's that, I wonder?\" she mused. To see smoke on the horizon  in that direction was unusual, though out toward Durango the grassy  benches would often burn over. And these low clouds of smoke resembled  those she had seen before.    \"It's a long way off,\" she added.    So she kept on, now and then gazing at the smoke. As she grew nearer to  the first monument she was surprised, then amazed, at its height and  surpassing size. It was mountain-high--a grand tower--smooth, worn,  glistening, yellow and red. The trail she had followed petered out in a  deep wash, and beyond that she crossed no more trails. The sage had  grown meager and the greasewoods stunted and dead; and cacti appeared  on barren places. The grass had not failed, but it was not rich grass  such as the horses and cattle grazed upon miles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#19)"],[1,"remember that the perceptive sense is the traveller, the  knowledge of God the goal, the doctrines of this ascent, or upward progress  is the Tarikat, or the road. The extinction of self is necessary before any  progress can be made on that road. A Sufi poet writes:--     \"Plant one foot upon the neck of self,    The other in thy Friend's domain;    In everything His presence see,    For other vision is in vain.\"    {91}    Sa'di in the Bustan says: \"Art thou a friend of God? Speak not of self, for  to speak of God and of self is infidelity.\" Shaikh Abu'l-Faiz, a great poet  and a friend of the Emperor Akbar, from whom he received the honourable  title of Malik-ush-Shu'ara--Master of the Poets, says: \"Those who have not  closed the door on existence and non-existence reap no advantage from the  calm of this world and of the world to come.\" Khusrau, another well-known  poet says:--     \"I have become Thou: Thou art become I,    I am the body, Thou the soul;    Let no one henceforth say    That I am distinct from Thee, and Thou from me.\"    The fact is, that Persian poetry is almost entirely Sufiistic. It is  difficult for the uninitiated to arrive at the esoteric meaning of these  writings. Kitman, or the art of hiding from the profane religious beliefs,  often contrary to the revealed law, has always been a special quality of  the East. Pantheistic doctrines are largely inculcated.[81] Thus:--     \"I was, ere a name had been named upon earth;    Ere one trace yet existed of aught that has birth;    When the locks of the Loved One streamed forth for a sign,    And Being was none, save the Presence Divine!    Named and name were alike emanations from Me,    Ere aught that was 'I' existed, or 'We.'\"    The poet then describes his fruitless search for rest and peace in  Christianity, Hinduism, and the religion of the Parsee. Even Islam gave him  no satisfaction, for--     \"Nor above nor beneath came the Loved One to view,    I toiled to the summit, wild, pathless and lone,    Of the globe-girding Kaf[82]:--but the 'Anka[83] had flown!    {92}    The sev'nth heaven I traversed--the sev'nth heaven explored,    But in neither discern'd I the court of the Lord!    I question'd the Pen and the Tablet of Fate,    But they whisper'd not where He pavilions His state;    My vision I strain'd; but my God-scanning eye    No trace, that to Godhead belongs, could descry.    My glance I bent inward; within my own breast,    Lo, the vainly sought elsewhere, the Godhead confess'd!    In the whirl of its transport my spirit was toss'd,    _Till each atom of separate being I lost_.\"    These are the words of the greatest authority among the Sufis, the famous  Maulana Jelal-ud-din Rumi, founder of the order of the Maulavi Darwishes.  He also relates the following story: \"One knocked at the door of the  beloved, and a voice from within said: 'Who is there?' Then he answered,  '_It is I._' The voice replied, 'This house will not hold _me_ and _thee_!'  So the door remained shut. The lover retired to a wilderness, and spent  some time in solitude, fasting, and prayer. One year elapsed, when he again  returned, and knocked at the door. 'Who is there?' said the voice. The  lover answered, '_It is thou._' Then the door was opened.\"    The great object of life, then, being to escape from the hindrances to pure  love and to a return to the divine essence, the Talib, or seeker, attaches  himself to a Murshid, or teacher. If he prosecutes his studies according to  Sufiistic methods he now often enters one of the many orders of Darwishes.  After due preparation under his Murshid, he is allowed to enter on the  road. He then becomes a Salik, or traveller, whose business henceforth is  suluk that is, devotion to one idea--the knowledge of God. In this road  there are eight stages. (1) Service. Here he must serve God and obey the  Law for he is still in bondage. (2) Love. It is supposed that now the  Divine influence has so attracted his soul that he really loves God. (3)  Seclusion. Love having expelled all worldly desires, he arrives at this  stage, and passes his time in meditation on the deeper doctrines {93} of  Sufiism regarding the Divine nature. (4) Knowledge. The meditation in the  preceding stage, and the investigation of the metaphysical theories  concerning God, His nature, His attributes and the like make him an  'Arif--one who knows. (5) Ecstasy. The mental excitement caused by such  continued meditation on abstruse subjects produces a kind of frenzy, which  is looked upon as a mark of direct illumination of the heart from God. It  is known as Hal--the state; or Wajd--ecstasy. Arrival at this stage is  highly valued, for it is the certain entrance to the next. (6) Haqiqat--the  Truth. Now to the traveller is revealed the true nature of God, now he  learns the reality of that which he has been for so long seeking. This  admits him to the highest stage in his journey, as far as this life is  concerned. (7) That stage is Wasl--union with God.     \"There was a door to which I found no key;    There was a veil past which I could not see:    Some little talk of Me and Thee    There seemed--and then no more of Thee and Me.\"    He cannot, in this life, go beyond that, and very few reach that exalted  stage. Thus arose a \"system of Pantheism, which represents joy and sorrow,  good and evil, pleasure and pain as manifestations of one changeless  essence.\" Religion, as made known by an outward revelation, is, to the few  who reach this stage, a thing of the past. Even its restraints are not  needed. The soul that is united to God can do no evil. The poet Khusrau  says: \"Love is the object of my worship, what need have I of Islam?\"    Death ensues and with it the last stage is reached. (8) It is  Fana--extinction. The seeker after all his search, the traveller after all  his wearisome journey passes behind the veil and finds--nothing! As the  traveller proceeds from stage to stage, the restraints of an objective  revelation and of an outward system are less and less heeded. \"The {94}  religion of the mystic consists in his immediate communication with God,  and when once this has been established, the value of ecclesiastical forms,  and of the historical part of religion, becomes doubtful.\" What law can  bind the soul in union with God, what outward system impose any trammels on  one who, in the \"Ecstasy,\" has received from Him, who is the Truth, the  direct revelation of His own glorious nature? Moral laws and ceremonial  observances have only an allegorical signification. Creeds are but fetters  cunningly devised to limit the flight of the soul; all that is objective in  religion is a restraint to the reason of the initiated.[84]    Pantheistic in creed, and too often Antinomian in practice, Sufiism  possesses no regenerative power in Islam. \"It is not a substantive religion  such as shapes the life of races or of nations, it is a state of opinion.\"  No Muslim State makes a national profession of Sufiism.    In spite of all its dogmatic utterances, in spite of much that is sublime  in its idea of the search after light and truth, Sufiism ends in utter  negation of all separate existence. The pantheism of the Sufis, this  esoteric doctrine of Islam, as a moral doctrine leads to the same  conclusions as materialism, \"the negation of human liberty, the  indifference to actions and the legitimacy of all temporal enjoyments.\"    The result of Sufiism has been the establishment of a large number of  religious orders known as Darwishes.[85] These men are looked upon with  disfavour by the {95} orthodox; but they flourish nevertheless, and in  Turkey at the present day have great influence. There are in Constantinople  two hundred Takiahs, or monasteries. The Darwishes are not organized with  such regularity, nor subject to discipline so severe as that of the  Christian Monastic orders; but they surpass them in number. Each order has  its own special mysteries and practices by which its members think they can  obtain a knowledge of the secrets of the invisible world. They are also  called Faqirs--poor men, not, however, always in the sense of being in  temporal want, but as being poor in the sight of God. As a matter of fact  the Darwishes of many of the orders do not beg, and many of the Takiahs are  richly endowed. They are divided into two great classes, the Ba Shara'  (with the Law) Darwishes; and the Be Shara' (without the Law). The former  prefer to rule their conduct according to the law of Islam and are called  the Salik--travellers on the path (tariqat) to heaven; the latter though  they call themselves Muslims do not conform to the law, and are called Azad  (free), or Majzub (abstracted), a term which signifies their renunciation  of all worldly cares and pursuits.    The Salik Darwishes are those who perform the Zikrs.[86] What little hope  there is of these professedly religious men working any reform in Islam  will be seen from the following account of their doctrines.[87]    1. God only exists,--He is in all things, and all things are in Him.  \"Verily we are _from_ God, and _to_ Him shall we return.\" (Sura ii. 151.)    {96}    2. All visible and invisible beings are an emanation from Him, and are not  really distinct from Him. Creation is only a pastime with God.    3. Paradise and Hell, and all the dogmas of positive religions, are only so  many allegories, the spirit of which is only known to the Sufi.    4. Religions are matters of indifference; they, however, serve as a means  of reaching to realities. Some, for this purpose, are more advantageous  than others. Among which is the Musalman religion, of which the doctrine of  the Sufis is the philosophy.    5. There is not any real difference between good and evil, for all is  reduced to unity, and God is the real author of the acts of mankind.    6. It is God who fixes the will of man. Man, therefore, is not free in his  actions.    7. The soul existed before the body, and is now "]]]
