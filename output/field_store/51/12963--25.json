All the most eminent  Masons were of Opinion, that Stones of the largest Scantlings were  there to be found, or nowhere. An Enquiry was made after all the good  Stone that England afforded. Next to _Portland_, _Rock-abbey_ Stone,  and some others in Yorkshire seemed the best and most durable; but  large Stone for the _Paul's_ Works was not easily to be had even there.  For these Reasons the _Surveyor_ concluded upon _Portland-stone_, and  also to use two Orders, and by that Means to keep the just Proportions  of his Cornices; otherwise he must have fallen short of the Height of  the Fabrick.... At the _Vatican Church_ [St. Peter's], Bramante was  ambitious to exceed the ancient _Greek_ and _Roman_ Temples ... and  although by Necessity he failed in the due Proportions of the proper  Members of his Cornice, because the _Tivoli_ stone would not hold out  for the Purpose; yet (as far as we can find) he succeeded in the  Diameter of his Columns, viz., nine Feet.\"--_Parentalia_, p. 288.

Stephen Wren (p. 269)  explains how his grandfather departed from the conventional  arrangement of architrave, frieze, and cornice in his entablatures,  omitting one or other of these whenever he thought good. Here, above  the pilasters and windows of the lower order he seems to have merged  the three, and in the corresponding part of the upper order to have  omitted anything like a frieze.

[83] \"Who among the crowds that gaze upon the building ever pause to  admire the flowerwork of St. Paul's?... It is no part of it. It is an  ugly excrescence. We always conceive the building without it, and  should be happier if our conception were not disturbed by its  presence. It makes the rest of the architecture look poverty-stricken,  instead of sublime; and yet it is never enjoyed itself\" (\"Seven  Lamps,\" iv. 13). All I can say is I have enjoyed studying it. Mr.  Edward Bell also sends me the following: \"We have a familiar instance  in the flower-work of St. Paul's, which is probably, in the abstract,  as perfect flower sculpture as could be produced at the time; and  which is just as rational an ornament of the building as so many  valuable Van Huysums, framed and glazed, and hung up over each window\"  (\"Stones of Venice,\" I., xxi. 3). In my humble opinion this criticism  is overdrawn; and, after all, Mr. Ruskin commends the sculpture.    [84] Dugdale, p. 191; but some authorities give double that of St.  Paul's.    [85] Fortunately for effect the technical distances are slightly  exceeded. The \"Parentalia\" says \"alternately,\" but the central is  wider than the remaining four, which are similar.    [86] The objection that the exterior of the West Front does not  correspond with the interior is not accurate. The west end inside  contains (_a_) the lower stage, with the great arch and doorway, and  (_b_) the upper, with the window.    [87] \"Parentalia,\" p. 292.    [88] A curious instance of how words change their meaning, (_a_) A  building--domus; (_b_) the most important building; (_c_) the most  important and striking feature of the building. As everybody now  speaks of the \"Dome\" of St. Paul's, I have adopted the word instead of  \"Cupola.\"    [89] \"Tholobate\" means what its derivation implies, \"the base of a  cupola.\" Why should this part be called the attic? How can an attic,  properly speaking, have a gigantic hemisphere above it?          CHAPTER VI.    INTERIOR.      The measurements show a marked diminution from the exterior--viz., 460  feet in length, a little under a hundred feet in breadth without  reckoning the recesses underneath the windows, and 240 feet across the  transepts.    In the Surveyor's favourite the Dome was almost everything; the four  short arms being so constructed as to afford picturesque and varied  vistas. Probably the acoustic properties would have been superior, and  for the ordinary purposes of congregational worship there would have  been less unused space. Hence it need take no one by surprise that  some, although they recognise the superiority of the present exterior,  give the preference to the originally designed interior. The short  arms were expanded into choir, transepts, and nave; the elaborate  vestibule has gone, but the west chapels have appeared. Finally, the  curved lines at the angles of the arms, designed to aid the interior  vistas, have given way to the orthodox right angles. It is impossible  to say how far Wren would have altered his opinions had he ever seen  the present building filled from door to door, as it now occasionally  is.[90]    Disappointed at the rejection of his pet scheme, Wren turned his  attention to the Basilica of Constantine, with its three aisles of  three arches apiece. \"_This Temple of Peace being an Example of a  Three Aisle Fabric is certainly the best and most authentic pattern of  a cathedral Church, which must have three Aisles according to Custom,  and be vaulted._\"[91] Piers were used in this building, the columns  being merely ornamental; but the interior of St. Paul's is in many  respects essentially different from its Roman model. In the Temple of  Peace three arches cover the enormous length of over 250 feet, and  seriously diminish the apparent size; in St. Paul's their span is less  than half of this. Indeed, in this respect Wren adopted a _via media_  between the Roman and the Anglo-Norman and Pointed. Old St. Paul's,  for instance, contained twice as many arches in the same length as its  successor, and Rochester still more. This use of larger arches renders  the perspective less effective, as any one can see by comparing the  views of Old and New St. Paul's. A second alteration from the Temple  of Peace to be mentioned is the massiveness of the piers. Wren's  regard for stability caused him to make his vast square supports of a  solidity exceeding those of Mainz and Speier. From the Romans the  Surveyor adopted the round arch, with its borrowed Grecian  architecture partly cut away; and this, next to the dome, is the most  striking feature of the interior.    Before proceeding to the different members, the symmetry and  correspondence of parts and details require to be mentioned. They  strike the eye everywhere. Those who claim that in this respect Exeter  is the most perfect cathedral, not only in England but throughout the  world, must limit their comparison to the older buildings. Here, when  we have described the details of the architecture of the nave, we have  little or nothing that requires to be said of the architecture of the  choir and transepts. The dome, of course, has features peculiar to  itself.      THE NAVE.    As we pass under the western portico we notice the bas-reliefs of  Francis Bird above the doors, and on either side of the main door.  They are respectable and nothing more. Over the central door St. Paul  is preaching at Berea. The original pavement of Purbeck, Welsh, and  Torbay marble remains throughout the building, excepting where the new  reredos has necessitated certain alterations. The length to the dome  area is a little over 200 feet, the width as above, and the height of  the central vaulting 89 feet.    The main west doorway has the round arch resting upon coupled  pilasters, the keystone is adorned with the head and arms of a winged  figure. On either side are likewise coupled pilasters of the largest  size. The doors of the small rooms or closets on either side reveal  the enormous size of the end piers projecting from the west wall.  Above the entablature of the main arch is a gallery, and the window  has lately been filled in with designs in Munich glass in memory of  Mr. Thomas Brown, of the firm of Longmans and Co. The subjects are  appropriately taken from the life of St. Paul--the Conversion, and the  subsequent visit of Ananias at Damascus. The kneeling figures below  are those of Mr. Brown and his wife.       [Illustration: THE CHOIR AND NAVE, FROM THE EAST END.]    The general ground-plan is of five compartments. Four are formed by  the arcading, and the fifth by the great transverse archway connecting  the nave and dome. The western bay or severy has a greater extension  east and west than the three to the east, and corresponds to the  adjacent chapels. It is square in the plan, and the others oblong; an  important difference, as we shall see when we come to the Vaulting.    There are throughout in reality three stages in the elevation--The  Main Arcade, Triforium Belt, or \"Attic,\" and Clerestory. The pedantic  objection to the use of this simple and familiar terminology and  system of classification seems to have arisen from the idea that St.  Paul's must be treated as though it were a purely Classical building.  Upon their fronts the piers have great Corinthian pilasters. These are  continued above the capitals, and the great transverse arches of the  vaulting spring from the continuations on a level with the top of the  triforium. These great pilasters form the divisions east and west into  severies.       [Illustration: THE ORDER OF THE INTERIOR.     _Drawn by Peter Cazalet._]    =The Main Arcade.=--The sides of the piers (east and west) have  smaller pilasters, coupled and with narrow panels between, and above  these is a plain entablature from which the broad arches rise.

The revolution of Saturn is the slowest of any among  the planets known to the ancients. It takes almost thirty years for its  accomplishment, and at that distance the Saturnian world, though it  still shines with the brilliancy of a star of the first magnitude,  exhibits to our eyes a pale and leaden hue. Here is, indeed, the god of  Time, with slow and almost funereal gait.    Poor Saturn won no favor with the poets and astrologers. He bore the  horrid reputation of being the inexhaustible source of misfortune and  evil fates,--whereof he is wholly innocent, troubling himself not at all  with our world nor its inhabitants.    This world travels in the vastness of the Heavens at a distance of 1,421  million kilometers (881,000,000 miles) from the Sun. Hence it is ten  times farther from the orb of day than the Earth, though still  illuminated and governed by the Sun-God. Its gigantic orbit is ten times  larger than our own.    Its revolution round the Sun is accomplished in 10,759 days, _i.e._, 29  years, 167 days, and as this strange planet rotates upon itself with  great rapidity in 10 hours, 15 minutes, its year comprises no less than  25,217 days. What a calendar! The Saturnians must needs have a  prodigious memory not to get hopelessly involved in this interminable  number of days. A curious world, where each year stands for almost  thirty of our own, and where the day is more than half as short again as  ours. But we shall presently find other and more extraordinary  differences on this planet.    In the first place it is nearly nine and a half times larger than our  world. It is a globe, not spherical, but spheroidal, and the flattening  of its poles, which is one-tenth, exceeds that of all the other planets,  even Jupiter. It follows that its equatorial diameter is 112,500  kilometers (69,750 miles), while its polar diameter measures only  110,000 kilometers (68,200).    In volume, Saturn is 719 times larger than the Earth, but its density is  only 128/1000 of our own; _i.e._, the materials of which it is composed  are much less heavy, so that it weighs only 92 times more than our  Earth. Its surface is 85 times vaster than that of the Earth, no  insignificant proportion.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--Saturn.]    The dipping of Saturn's axis of rotation is much the same as our own.  Hence we conclude that the seasons of this planet are analogous to ours  in relative intensity. Only upon this far-off world each season lasts  for seven years. At the distance at which it gravitates in space, the  heat and light which it receives from the Sun are 90 times less active  than such as reach our selves; but it apparently possesses an atmosphere  of great density, which may be constituted so that the heat is  preserved, and the planet maintained in a calorific condition but little  inferior to our own.    In the telescope, the disk of Saturn exhibits large belts that recall  those of Jupiter, though they are broader and less accentuated (Fig.  47). There are doubtless zones of clouds or rapid currents circulating  in the atmosphere. Spots are also visible whose displacement assists in  calculating the diurnal motions of this globe.    The most extraordinary characteristic of this strange world is, however,  the existence of a vast _ring_, which is almost flat and very large, and  entirely envelops the body of the planet. It is suspended in the  Saturnian sky, like a gigantic triumphal arch, at a height of some  20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) above the equator. This splendid arch  is circular, like an immense crown illuminated by the Sun. From here we  only see it obliquely, and it appears to us elliptical; a part of the  ring seems to pass in front of Saturn, and its shadow is visible on the  planet, while the opposite part passes behind.    This ring, which measures 284,000 kilometers (176,080 miles) in  diameter, and less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in breadth, is divided  into three distinct zones: the exterior is less luminous than the  center, which is always brighter than the planet itself; the interior is  very dark, and spreads out like a dusky and faintly transparent veil,  through which Saturn can be distinguished.    What is the nature of these vast concentric circles that surround the  planet with a luminous halo? They are composed of an innumerable number  of particles, of a quantity of cosmic fragments, which are swept off in  a rapid revolution, and gravitate round the planet at variable speed and  distance. The nearer particles must accomplish their revolution in 5  hours, 50 minutes, and the most distant in about 12 hours, 5 minutes, to  prevent them from being merged in the surface of Saturn: their own  centrifugal force sustains them in space.    [Illustration: FIG. 48. Varying perspective of Saturn's Rings, as seen  from the Earth.]    With a good glass the effect of these rings is most striking, and one  can not refrain from emotion on contemplating this marvel, whereby one  of the brothers of our terrestrial country is crowned with a golden  diadem. Its aspects vary with its perspective relative to the Earth, as  may be seen from the subjoined figure (Fig. 48).    We must not quit the Saturnian province without mentioning the eight  satellites that form his splendid suite:      Names.        Distance from the planet.      Time of revolution.

Now we shall cross at a bound the 1,400 million kilometers (868,000,000  miles) that separate us from the last station but one of the immense  solar system.      URANUS    On March 13, 1781, William Herschel, a Hanoverian astronomer who had  emigrated to England, having abandoned the study of music to devote  himself to the sublime science of the Heavens, was observing the vast  fields with their constellations of golden stars, when he perceived a  luminous point that appeared to him to exceed that of the other  celestial luminaries in diameter. He replaced the magnification of his  telescope by more powerful eye-pieces, and found that the apparent  diameter of the orb increased proportionately with the amplification of  the power, which does not happen in the case of stars at infinite  distance. His observations on the following evenings enabled him to note  the slow and imperceptible movement of this star upon the celestial  sphere, and left him in no further doubt: there was no star, but some  much nearer orb, in all probability a comet, for the great astronomer  dared not predict the discovery of a new planet. And it was thus, under  the name of cometary orb, that the seventh child of the Sun was  announced. The astronomers sought to determine the motions of the new  arrival, to discover for it an elliptical orbit such as most comets  have. But their efforts were vain, and after several months' study the  conclusion was reached that here was a new planet, throwing back the  limits of the solar system to a point far beyond that of the Saturnian  frontier, as admitted from antiquity.    This new world received the name of Uranus, father of Saturn, his  nearest neighbor in the solar empire. Uranus shines in the firmament as  a small star of sixth magnitude, invisible to the unaided eye for  normal sight, at a distance of 2,831,000,000 kilometers (1,755,000,000  miles) from the Sun. Smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, this planet is yet  larger than Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Earth together, thus  presenting proportions that claim our respect and admiration.    His diameter may be taken at about 55,000 kilometers (34,200 miles),  that is, rather more than four times the breadth of the terrestrial  diameter. Sixty-nine times more voluminous than the Earth, and seventeen  times more extensive in surface, this new world is much less than our  own in density. The matter of which it is composed is nearly five times  lighter than that of our globe.    Spectral analysis shows that this distant planet is surrounded with an  atmosphere very different from that which we breathe, enclosing gases  that do not exist in ours.    The Uranian globe courses over the fields of infinity in a vast orbit  seventeen times larger than our own, and its revolution lasts 36,688  days, _i.e._, 84 years, 8 days. It travels slowly and sadly under the  pale and languishing rays of the Sun, which sends it nearly three  hundred times less of light and heat than we receive. At this distance  the solar disk would present a diameter seventeen times smaller than  that which we admire, and a surface three hundred times less vast. A  dull world indeed! And what an interminable year! The idle people who  are in the habit of being bored must find time even longer upon Uranus  than upon our little Earth, where the days pass so rapidly. And if  matters are arranged there as here, a babe of a year old, beginning to  babble in its nurse's arms, would already have lived as long as an old  man of eighty-four in this world.    But what most seriously complicates the Calendar of the Uranians is the  fact that the four moons which accompany the planet accomplish their  revolution in four different kinds of months, in two, four,"]]]
