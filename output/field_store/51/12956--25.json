How childlike she was in some ways! That trace of defiance--it was so  like a child who expected to be scolded for some wrong attitude of  mind. And yet there were moments when she looked the tall proud queen.  Sometimes, when the path grew narrow, she walked before him, her hand  on the dog's head. Alan liked this, since it left him free to watch  admiringly the swinging grace of her step and the white curves of her  neck beneath the thick braid of hair, which today was wound about her  head. When she dropped back beside him in the wider spaces, he could  only have stolen glances at her profile, delicately, strongly cut,  virginal in its soft curves, childlike in its purity. Once she looked  around and caught his glance; again she flushed, and something strange  and exultant stirred in Alan's heart. It was as if that maiden blush  were the involuntary, unconscious admission of some power he had over  her--a power which her hitherto unfettered spirit had never before  felt. The cold indifference he had seen in her face at their first  meeting was gone, and something told him it was gone forever.    When they came in sight of Four Winds they saw two people walking up  the road from the harbour and a few further steps brought them face to  face with Captain Anthony Oliver and his old housekeeper.    The Captain's appearance was a fresh surprise to Alan. He had expected  to meet a rough, burly sailor, loud of voice and forbidding of manner.  Instead, Captain Anthony was a tall, well-built man of perhaps fifty.  His face, beneath its shock of iron-grey hair, was handsome but wore a  somewhat forbidding expression, and there was something in it, apart  from line or feature, which did not please Alan. He had no time to  analyze this impression, for Lynde said hurriedly, \"Father, this is  Mr. Douglas. He has just done me a great service.\"    She briefly explained her accident; when she had finished, the Captain  turned to Alan and held out his hand, a frank smile replacing the  rather suspicious and contemptuous scowl which had previously  overshadowed it.    \"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Douglas,\" he said cordially. \"You must  come up to the house and let me thank you at leisure. As a rule I'm  not very partial to the cloth, as you may have heard. In this case it  is the man, not the minister, I invite.\"    The front door of Four Winds opened directly into a wide,  low-ceilinged living room, furnished with simplicity and good taste.  Leaving the two men there, Lynde and the old cousin vanished, and Alan  found himself talking freely with the Captain who could, as it  appeared, talk well on many subjects far removed from Four Winds. He  was evidently a clever, self-educated man, somewhat opinionated and  given to sarcasm; he never made any references to his own past life or  experiences, but Alan discovered him to be surprisingly well read in  politics and science. Sometimes in the pauses of the conversation Alan  found the older man looking at him in a furtive way he did not like,  but the Captain was such an improvement on what he had been led to  expect that he was not inclined to be over critical. At least, this  was what he honestly thought. He did not suspect that it was because  this man was Lynde's father that he wished to think as well as  possible of him.    Presently Lynde came in. She had changed her outdoor dress, stained  with moss and soil in her fall, for a soft clinging garment of some  pale yellow material, and her long, thick braid of hair hung over her  shoulder. She sat mutely down in a dim corner and took no part in the  conversation except to answer briefly the remarks which Alan addressed  to her. Emily came in and lighted the lamp on the table. She was as  grim and unsmiling as ever, yet she cast a look of satisfaction on  Alan as she passed out. One dog lay down at Lynde's feet, the other  sat on his haunches by her side and laid his head on her lap. Rexton  and its quiet round of parish duties seemed thousands of miles away  from Alan, and he wondered a little if this were not all a dream.    When he went away the Captain invited him back.    \"If you like to come, that is,\" he said brusquely, \"and always as the  man, not the priest, remember. I don't want you by and by to be slyly  slipping in the thin end of any professional wedges. You'll waste your  time if you do. Come as man to man and you'll be welcome, for I like  you--and it's few men I like. But don't try to talk religion to me.\"    \"I never talk religion,\" said Alan emphatically. \"I try to live it.  I'll not come to your house as a self-appointed missionary, sir, but I  shall certainly act and speak at all times as my conscience and my  reverence for my vocation demands. If I respect your beliefs, whatever  they may be, I shall expect you to respect mine, Captain Oliver.\"    \"Oh, I won't insult your God,\" said the Captain with a faint sneer.    Alan went home in a tumult of contending feelings. He did not  altogether like Captain Anthony--that was very clear to him, and yet  there was something about the man that attracted him. Intellectually  he was a worthy foeman, and Alan had often longed for such since  coming to Rexton. He missed the keen, stimulating debates of his  college days and, now there seemed a chance of renewing them, he was  eager to grasp it. And Lynde--how beautiful she was! What though she  shared--as was not unlikely--in her father's lack of belief? She could  not be essentially irreligious--that were impossible in a true woman.  Might not this be his opportunity to help her--to lead her into dearer  light? Alan Douglas was a sincere man, with himself as well as with  others, yet there are some motives that lie, in their first inception,  too deep even for the probe of self-analysis. He had not as yet the  faintest suspicion as to the real source of his interest in Lynde  Oliver--in his sudden forceful desire to be of use and service to  her--to rescue her from spiritual peril as he had that day rescued her  from bodily danger.    She must have a lonely, unsatisfying life, he thought. It is my duty  to help her if I can.    It did not then occur to him that duty in this instance wore a much  more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience.           *       *       *       *       *    Alan did not mean to be oversoon in going back to Four Winds, but  three days later a book came to him which Captain Anthony had  expressed a wish to see. It furnished an excuse for an earlier call.  After that he went often. He always found the Captain courteous and  affable, old Emily grimly cordial, Lynde sometimes remote and demure,  sometimes frankly friendly. Occasionally, when the Captain was away in  his yacht, he went for a walk with her and her dogs along the shore or  through the sweet-smelling pinelands up the lake. He found that she  loved books and was avid for more of them than she could obtain; he  was glad to take her several and discuss them with her. She liked  history and travels best. With novels she had no patience, she said  disdainfully. She seldom spoke of herself or her past life and Alan  fancied she avoided any personal reference. But once she said  abruptly, \"Why do you never ask me to go to church? I've always been  afraid you would.\"    \"Because I do not think it would do you any good to go if you didn't  want to,\" said Alan gravely. \"Souls should not be rudely handled any  more than bodies.\"    She looked at him reflectively, her finger denting her chin in a  meditative fashion she had.    \"You are not at all like Mr. Strong. He always scolded me, when he got  a chance, for not going to church. I would have hated him if it had  been worthwhile. I told him one day that I was nearer to God under  these pines than I could be in any building fashioned by human hands.  He was very much shocked. But I don't want you to misunderstand me.  Father does not go to church because he does not believe there is a  God. But I know there is. Mother taught me so. I have never gone to  church because Father would not allow me, and I could not go now in  Rexton where the people talk about me so. Oh, I know they do--you know  it, too--but I do not care for them. I know I'm not like other girls.  I would like to be but I can't be--I never can be--now.\"    There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite  understand--a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the  circumstances that hedged her in.    \"Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not  content you?\" he said gently.    \"But it does content me,\" said Lynde imperiously. \"I want no other--I  wish this life to go on forever--forever, do you understand? If I were  sure that it would--if I were sure that no change would ever come to  me, I would be perfectly content. It is the fear that a change will  come that makes me wretched. Oh!\" She shuddered and put her hands over  her eyes.    Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be  alone in the world. He wanted to comfort her--reassure her--but he did  not know how.    One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and,  seeing the Captain in the living room, he stepped in unannounced.  Captain Anthony was sitting by the table, his head in his hands; at  Alan's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face, blackened by a  furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence.    \"What do you want here?\" he said, following up the demand with a  string of vile oaths.    Before Alan could summon his scattered wits, Lynde glided in with a  white, appealing face. Wordlessly she grasped Alan's arm, drew him  out, and shut the door.    \"Oh, I've been watching for you,\" she said breathlessly. \"I was afraid  you might come tonight--but I missed you.\"    \"But your father?\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#19)"],[1," bed. It will save fuel.\"    When Theodora went up to her little room her face was very thoughtful.  She took a small box from her table and carried it to the window. In  it was a very pretty little gold locket hung on a narrow blue ribbon.  Theodora held it tenderly in her fingers, and looked out over the  moonlit prairie with a very sober face. Could she give up her dear  locket--the locket Donald had given her just before he started for the  Klondike? She had never thought she could do such a thing. It was  almost the only thing she had to remind her of Donald--handsome,  merry, impulsive, warmhearted Donald, who had gone away four years ago  with a smile on his bonny face and splendid hope in his heart.    \"Here's a locket for you, Gift o' God,\" he had said gaily--he had such  a dear loving habit of calling her by the beautiful meaning of her  name. A lump came into Theodora's throat as she remembered it. \"I  couldn't afford a chain too, but when I come back I'll bring you a  rope of Klondike nuggets for it.\"    Then he had gone away. For two years letters had come from him  regularly. Then he wrote that he had joined a prospecting party to a  remote wilderness. After that was silence, deepening into anguish of  suspense that finally ended in hopelessness. A rumour came that Donald  Prentice was dead. None had returned from the expedition he had  joined. Theodora had long ago given up all hope of ever seeing Donald  again. Hence her locket was doubly dear to her.    But Aunt Elizabeth had always been so good and loving and kind to her.  Could she not make the sacrifice for her sake? Yes, she could and  would. Theodora flung up her head with a gesture that meant decision.  She took out of the locket the bits of hair--her mother's and  Donald's--which it contained (perhaps a tear or two fell as she did  so) and then hastily donned her warmest cap and wraps. It was only  three miles to Spencer; she could easily walk it in an hour and, as it  was Christmas Eve, the shops would be open late. She muse walk, for  Ned could not be taken out again, and the mare's foot was sore.  Besides, Aunt Elizabeth must not know until it was done.    As stealthily as if she were bound on some nefarious errand, Theodora  slipped downstairs and out of the house. The next minute she was  hurrying along the trail in the moonlight. The great dazzling prairie  was around her, the mystery and splendour of the northern night all  about her. It was very calm and cold, but Theodora walked so briskly  that she kept warm. The trail from Red Butte to Spencer was a lonely  one. Mr. Lurgan's house, halfway to town, was the only dwelling on it.    When Theodora reached Spencer she made her way at once to the only  jewellery store the little town contained. Mr. Benson, its owner, had  been a friend of her uncle's, and Theodora felt sure that he would  buy her locket. Nevertheless her heart beat quickly, and her breath  came and went uncomfortably fast as she went in. Suppose he wouldn't  buy it. Then there would be no Christmas for the children at Red  Butte.    \"Good evening, Miss Theodora,\" said Mr. Benson briskly. \"What can I do  for you?\"    \"I'm afraid I'm not a very welcome sort of customer, Mr. Benson,\" said  Theodora, with an uncertain smile. \"I want to sell, not buy. Could  you--will you buy this locket?\"    Mr. Benson pursed up his lips, took up the locket, and examined it.  \"Well, I don't often buy second-hand stuff,\" he said, after some  reflection, \"but I don't mind obliging you, Miss Theodora. I'll give  you four dollars for this trinket.\"    Theodora knew the locket had cost a great deal more than that, but  four dollars would get what she wanted, and she dared not ask for  more. In a few minutes the locket was in Mr. Benson's possession, and  Theodora, with four crisp new bills in her purse, was hurrying to the  toy store. Half an hour later she was on her way back to Red Butte,  with as many parcels as she could carry--Jimmy's skates, two lovely  dolls for the twins, packages of nuts and candy, and a nice plump  turkey. Theodora beguiled her lonely tramp by picturing the children's  joy in the morning.    About a quarter of a mile past Mr. Lurgan's house the trail curved  suddenly about a bluff of poplars. As Theodora rounded the turn she  halted in amazement. Almost at her feet the body of a man was lying  across the road. He was clad in a big fur coat, and had a fur cap  pulled well down over his forehead and ears. Almost all of him that  could be seen was a full bushy beard. Theodora had no idea who he was,  or where he had come from. But she realized that he was unconscious,  and that he would speedily freeze to death if help were not brought.  The footprints of a horse galloping across the prairie suggested a  fall and a runaway, but Theodora did not waste time in speculation.  She ran back at full speed to Mr. Lurgan's, and roused the household.  In a few minutes Mr. Lurgan and his son had hitched a horse to a  wood-sleigh, and hurried down the trail to the unfortunate man.    Theodora, knowing that her assistance was not needed, and that she  ought to get home as quickly as possible, went on her way as soon as  she had seen the stranger in safe keeping. When she reached the little  log house she crept in, cautiously put the children's gifts in their  stockings, placed the turkey on the table where Aunt Elizabeth would  see it the first thing in the morning, and then slipped off to bed, a  very weary but very happy girl.    The joy that reigned in the little log house the next day more than  repaid Theodora for her sacrifice.    \"Whoopee, didn't I tell you that Santa Claus would come all right!\"  shouted the delighted Jimmy. \"Oh, what splendid skates!\"    The twins hugged their dolls in silent rapture, but Aunt Elizabeth's  face was the best of all.    Then the dinner had to be prepared, and everybody had a hand in that.  Just as Theodora, after a grave peep into the oven, had announced that  the turkey was done, a sleigh dashed around the house. Theodora flew  to answer the knock at the door, and there stood Mr. Lurgan and a big,  bewhiskered, fur-coated fellow whom Theodora recognized as the  stranger she had found on the trail. But--_was_ he a stranger? There  was something oddly familiar in those merry brown eyes. Theodora felt  herself growing dizzy.    \"Donald!\" she gasped. \"Oh, Donald!\"    And then she was in the big fellow's arms, laughing and crying at the  same time.    Donald it was indeed. And then followed half an hour during which  everybody talked at once, and the turkey would have been burned to a  crisp had it not been for the presence of mind of Mr. Lurgan who,  being the least excited of them all, took it out of the oven, and set  it on the back of the stove.    \"To think that it was you last night, and that I never dreamed it,\"  exclaimed Theodora. \"Oh, Donald, if I hadn't gone to town!\"    \"I'd have frozen to death, I'm afraid,\" said Donald soberly. \"I got  into Spencer on the last train last night. I felt that I must come  right out--I couldn't wait till morning. But there wasn't a team to be  got for love or money--it was Christmas Eve and all the livery rigs  were out. So I came on horseback. Just by that bluff something  frightened my horse, and he shied violently. I was half asleep and  thinking of my little sister, and I went off like a shot. I suppose I  struck my head against a tree. Anyway, I knew nothing more until I  came to in Mr. Lurgan's kitchen. I wasn't much hurt--feel none the  worse of it except for a sore head and shoulder. But, oh, Gift o' God,  how you have grown! I can't realize that you are the little sister I  left four years ago. I suppose you have been thinking I was dead?\"    \"Yes, and, oh, Donald, where _have_ you been?\"    \"Well, I went way up north with a prospecting party. We had a tough  time the first year, I can tell you, and some of us never came back.  We weren't in a country where post offices were lying round loose  either, you see. Then at last, just as we were about giving up in  despair, we struck it rich. I've brought a snug little pile home with  me, and things are going to look up in this log house, Gift o' God.  There'll be no more worrying for you dear people over mortgages.\"    \"I'm so glad--for Auntie's sake,\" said Theodora, with shining eyes.  \"But, oh, Donald, it's best of all just to have you back. I'm so  perfectly happy that I don't know what to do or say.\"    \"Well, I think you might have dinner,\" said Jimmy in an injured tone.  \"The turkey's getting stone cold, and I'm most starving. I just can't  stand it another minute.\"    So, with a laugh, they all sat down to the table and ate the merriest  Christmas dinner the little log house had ever known.          How We Went to the Wedding      \"If it were to clear up I wouldn't know how to behave, it would seem  so unnatural,\" said Kate. \"Do you, by any chance, remember what the  sun looks like, Phil?\"    \"Does the sun ever shine in Saskatchewan anyhow?\" I asked with assumed  sarcasm, just to make Kate's big, bonny black eyes flash.    They did flash; but Kate laughed immediately after, as she sat down on  a chair in front of me and cradled her long, thin, spirited dark face  in her palms.    \"We have more sunny weather in Saskatchewan than in all the rest of  Canada put together, in an average year,\" she said, clicking her  strong, white teeth and snapping her eyes at me. \"But I can't blame  you for feeling sceptical about it, Phil. If I went to a new country  and it rained every day--all day--all night--after I got there for  three whole weeks I'd think things not lawful to be uttered about the  climate too. So, little cousin, I forgive you. Remember that 'into  each life some rain must fall, some days must be dark and dreary.' Oh,  if you'd only come to visit me last fall. We had such a bee-yew-tiful  September last year. We were drowned in sunshine. This fall we're  drowned in water. Old settlers "]]]
