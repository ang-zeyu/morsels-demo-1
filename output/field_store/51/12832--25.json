[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#19)"],[1,"two of the old houses of  Liverpool I have seen a remnant of the link days, in an extinguisher  attached to the lamp iron.  I think there is (or was) one in Mount  Pleasant, near the house with the variegated pebble pavement in front  (laid down, by the way, by a blind man).  The link-extinguisher was a  sort of narrow iron funnel of about six inches in diameter at the widest  end.  It was usually attached to a lamp-iron, and was used by thrusting  the link up it, when the light was to be put out.    People in those days seldom went out at night without a lantern, for what  with the ruggedness of the pavements and the vile state of the roads it  was by no means safe to life or limb to go without some mode of  illuminating the way.    Gas was introduced in 1816 and 1817.  Only one side of Castle-street was  lighted at first.  While we now acknowledge the invaluable introduction  of this fluid, when we consider the vast area over which it casts its  pleasant and cheerful beams, and the price we also pay for such an  unmistakable comfort and blessing, we shall not fail to peruse the first  advertisement of the Gas Company with intense interest.  With this belief  I insert a copy of it.  The rate of charge and the mode of ascertaining  the quantity of light consumed cannot but prove curious to us and rather  puzzling perhaps to understand.

No extra charge will be made, if the Light be extinguished in a      quarter of an hour after the time contracted for, and on Saturday      evenings the Company will allow burning till twelve o'clock.        The Rents will be collected at the commencement of each Quarter, and      will be apportioned as follows: Two-thirds of the above prices for      the two winter quarters, and One-third for the two summer quarters.      If the Lights amount, by the above table, to 10 pounds per annum, a      Discount of 2.5 per cent. will be allowed; if to 20 pounds, 5 per      cent.; if to 30 pounds, 7.5 per cent.; if to 40 pounds, 10 per cent.;      and if to 50 pounds, 12.5 per cent.

Just fancy such a tariff to be in existence at present!    Lord-street, previous to 1827, was very narrow; it was not so wide even  as Dale-street.  The houses and all the streets in Liverpool were just as  we see in third-rate country towns, having bowed shop-windows, or square  ones, projecting from the side of the house.  I recollect Church-street  and Ranelagh-street being paved in the centre only.  Cable-street,  Redcross-street and Park-lane were only flagged in 1821; and nearly all  the houses in these streets were then private dwellings.  In  Ranelagh-street the houses had high steps to the front doors.  The  porches of the old houses in Liverpool were remarkable for their handsome  appearance and patterns.  Many still remain but they are yearly  decreasing in number.  I recollect when the only shops in Church-street  were a grocer's (where part of Compton House now stands) and a  confectioner's at the corner of Church-alley.  Bold-street was nearly all  private houses, and there were very few shops in it, even some forty  years ago.  Seventy years since there was scarcely a house of any sort in  it.  I have been told that where the Athenaeum now stands in  Church-street, there was once a large pond on which the skaters used to  cut a figure, and that a farm-house stood at the corner of  Hanover-street.  Some houses in Hanover-street will be noticed as being  built out at angles with the street.  This was to secure a good view of  the river from the windows.  At the corner of Bold-street some ninety  years ago was a milkman's cottage and dairy.  Whitechapel, when I was a  lad, was a dreadful thoroughfare.  I have seen it deep in water, and  boats rowed about, conveying people from house to house, in times of  flood.  There used to be a channel with water running down the centre of  the street, which was considerably lower than it is at present.  It was  no uncommon thing for the cellars of all the houses to be filled with  water, and even now, I believe, some portion of the neighbourhood is not  unfrequently rendered damp and uncomfortable.  In the cellars under the  Forum, in Marble-street, there is a very deep well which is at all times  full; this well drains the premises.  This Forum, about fifty years ago,  was a well-known and much frequented arena for disputations of all sorts.  Many a clever speaker has addressed audiences now passed away.  Speaker  and spoken to are for the most part gone.  A great change took place some  forty years ago in the locality where St. John's Market now stands.  There was a ropewalk here which extended from where the angle of the  building faces the Amphitheatre, as far as Renshaw-street.  There was a  field at one time to the north of the ropery skirted by hedges which went  down the site of the present Hood-street, and round to where there is now  a large draper's shop in the Old Haymarket; the hedge then went up  John's-lane, and so round by the site of the lamp opposite the Queen's  Hotel, along Limekiln-lane to Ranelagh-street.  These were all fields,  being a portion of what was anciently called \"the Great Heath.\"  It was  at one time intended to erect a handsome Crescent where the cab-stand is  now.  The almshouses stood on this ground.  Limekiln-lane, now  Lime-street, was so called from the limekiln that stood on the site of  the present Skelhorn-street.  Here were open fields, which extended to  the London-road, quite famous for the assembling of all sorts of rough  characters, especially on summer evenings, and on Sundays.  Cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and pugilistic encounters used to be carried  on daily, and scenes of the utmost confusion took place, until public  murmurings compelled the authorities to keep order.  It was in the fields  about where the Lord Nelson-street rooms stand, that my grandfather  recollects seeing three, if not four, men hung for being mixed up in the  rebellion of '45.  They were hung there in chains for some time, and  afterwards buried at the foot of the gallows as a warning to evil-doers.    There were several mills in this vicinity, one of which was called the  White Mill, and there was a very curious story once commonly current  about it, in the town to the effect that the owner of it had been  murdered by a friend of his who kept a mill lower down the hill.  Whitemill-street is called after this White Mill.  The lower mill stood  where Hotham-street is now, which formerly was called Duncan-street.  The  mill occupied the site of the Quaker's school, which was pulled down to  make room for the railway yard.  When this mill was razed to the ground,  a grave was discovered in the foundation, in which was a skeleton, and it  was freely said that this was the White Mill miller, who had so  mysteriously disappeared some years previously.  It was the talk of the  town at the time, and crowds of persons went to the spot to look at the  grave.  When the mill in Duncan-street was taken down it was so rotten  that it was razed to the ground in one day.  Where St. George's Hall now  stands was the Infirmary.  It faced Islington Triangle, afterwards  converted into a market-place, being built round with small shops, having  a pump in the middle.  When this market was discontinued in 1848, the  tenants were removed to Gill-street, on its opening in September of that  year.  The Infirmary consisted of two wings and a centre; at the back was  a spacious garden or airing ground.  On Shaw's Brow lived the potters.  There were upwards of 2,000 persons engaged in this trade, which was  carried on to a very great extent.  Pottery in Liverpool was a  considerable manufacture, and it is said that it was Mr. Sadler, a potter  who lived in Harrington-street, that first discovered the art of printing  upon earthenware, through seeing his children stick pieces of printed  cotton fabric on some damaged plates they were playing with.  There were  many other large potteries in Liverpool at one period, besides those on  Shaw's Brow.  There was one at the corner of Fontenoy-street, of which  Alderman Shaw was proprietor.  There was one at the bottom of  Duke-street.  This was kept by Mr. Drinkwater, who married Captain  Leece's daughter, after whom Leece-street is named.  Pothouse-lane is a  reminder of the old trade.  There were other potteries on Copperas-hill.  I do not recollect much about these potteries; but I have heard my father  and mother talk about them amongst their \"Recollections.\"  This "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#19)"],[1,"was short lived.    While the engagement went on, the reptile looked dragon-like in aspect,  with its ruffled and inflated throat, serrated back, and writhing tail;  but in a very short time the dogs had obtained the mastery, and the  creature was examined, proving to be a kind of iguana, nearly six feet  in length, a great deal of which, however, was the attenuated tail.    The cracks and rifts in the hot bare stones as they climbed higher  seemed to swarm with lizards of all kinds, ready to dart into their  holes upon the approach of the dogs, while several times over the two  Zulu boys came running back, beckoning to Dick and Jack to go and see  some snake basking, twisted in a knot in some sunny spot.    Upon one of these occasions Jack was so struck by the peculiar swollen,  short appearance of the little serpent that he ran back and hailed his  father, who came up just as Coffee and Chicory were assuring Dick that  if he did what he had proposed to do, namely, taken up the short, thick  serpent, he would never have gone hunting any more.    In fact as soon as Jack had gone the serpent moved slightly, and wishing  his father to see it, and eager to stop its escape, Dick had attempted  to pick it up, when Coffee and Chicory threw themselves upon him, and a  short struggle ensued, which made Dick very angry, and he was very  nearly coming to blows.    \"The boys are quite right,\" said Mr Rogers sharply.  \"Dick, you ought  to have known better.  Don't you know what that thick, short serpent  is?\"    \"No, father,\" said Dick, in an injured tone.    \"Then you ought to know, my boy, for I have described it to you when  talking about the reptiles of this part of the world.  What do you say  it is, Jack?\"    \"I don't know, father; I'm not sure,\" replied Jack, glancing at Dick,  and feeling that it would hurt him to profess to greater knowledge than  his brother.    \"Nonsense!  I'm sure you do know,\" said Mr Rogers impatiently.    \"Is it the puff-adder, father?\" said Dick hesitatingly.    \"Of course it is, and you ought to have known the deadly pest.  No, no,  don't waste a charge upon it, and it may alarm any game.  Let one of the  boys kill it.\"    That was soon done, for Chicory made a sign to his brother, who touched  the puff-adder's tail and began to irritate it, making it turn and  strike viciously at the blade of his assegai.    That was what Chicory wanted.    The next moment his blade whished through the air, and the puff-adder's  head lay upon the ground.    \"You cannot be too careful, boys,\" said Mr Rogers, picking up the flat  spade-shaped head, and opening the jaws with the point of his knife.    \"Look, boys,\" he continued, as he made the jaws gape, and then raised up  a couple of keen transparent fangs that lay back upon the roof of the  creature's mouth.  \"Do you see?  There are the hollow fangs through  which a drop of deadly poison is injected in the blood and causes death.  Don't let's destroy life unnecessarily; but if we want food, or come  across any poisonous or dangerous beast, I think it is sentimentality to  refrain from ridding the world of such a pest.\"    Dick felt very ignorant, and wished he had known better; but he could  not help being pleased at his brother's manner; and the incident was  forgotten the next moment in one of those natural history adventures of  which they had all read, but had little expected to share in their  lives.    As they had climbed higher they had found the mountain more rugged, and  broken up into deep crevices and defiles, all of which were full of  interesting objects--flowers, plants, and foliage--such as they had  never before seen; while in the sheltered and often intense heat,  beetles and butterflies seemed to have found these rifts a perfect  paradise.    Dick had gone on first, and turning a corner he had found quite a rugged  shelf running alone the steep side of a ravine, the bottom of which was  carpeted with flowers that grew amongst the stones.    It was a very interesting spot, but as it seemed to lead right away into  the heart of the mountain he was about to turn back and rejoin his  party, when he caught sight of a gracefully-shaped large-eared gazelle  about fifty yards away, gazing apparently in another direction.    He could have shot it easily, but it seemed so quiet and tame that he  did not raise his piece, though if it had attempted to run, the thought  of the delicious roast it would make would undoubtedly have made him  bring it down.    Besides he wanted all the practice he could get with his rifle, and a  shot at a running antelope or gazelle was not to be missed.    Half wondering why it did not feed, he remained watching it, supposing  that it had heard some of the party lower down; when all at once the  sun's rays seemed to glance off something glistening and bright, and  straining forward to get a better view, Dick became aware of the fact  that a large serpent was twining fold after fold one over another, and  as, half petrified, he watched the reptile, he suddenly saw a monstrous  neck and head reared up in front of the gazelle.    The creature seemed to be all glistening umber brown and dusky yellow,  and its surface shone like burnished tortoiseshell in the glowing sun,  while to the boy's eyes it seemed, from the height to which the swaying  head was raised, that the body, half hidden from him by the herbage,  must be monstrous.    And all the time, fascinated as it were, or more probably paralysed by  fear, the gazelle stood perfectly still, watching the undulations of the  serpent's neck, and calmly awaiting its end.    Dick was so interested that he forgot that he held a rifle and shot-gun  in his hand.  He knew that the serpent was, as it were, playing with its  prey before seizing it, feeling probably, if it thought at all, quite  certain of the trembling creature whenever it felt disposed to strike,  and preparing itself for its banquet by writhing its body into a more  convenient place.    It was a horrible sight, and Dick waited to see the serpent seize the  gazelle, wrap round it and crush its quivering body out of shape, and  then slowly swallow it, till it formed a knot somewhere in the long  tapering form, and go to sleep till it was hungry again.    \"Ugh, you beast!\" ejaculated Dick; and the sound of his own voice seemed  to break the fascination of interest by which he had been held.    The next instant he was pitying the gazelle, and as he saw the serpent  draw back its head he laid the barrel of his piece against a block of  stone, waited until the quivering head was still and the jaws began to  distend, and then his trembling hand grew firm, and he drew the trigger.    The puff of smoke obscured everything for the moment, and he could not  start forward or he would have gone over the precipice, so he had to  wait till the vapour had passed away, when, to his great disgust, he  could see nothing.    The gazelle and serpent were both gone; so he began to load again,  wishing he could take better aim, when he heard a shout, and Chicory  came running up, followed by Coffee.    \"Boss Dick shoot um?  Boss Dick shoot noder lion?\" cried Chicory.    \"No,\" said Dick; \"it was a miss this time.\"    \"No,\" cried Coffee; \"I see um.  Look, boss, look!\"    Mr Rogers and Jack came hurrying up just then, and looking in the  direction pointed out, there was the serpent, writhing and twining in  the most horrible manner down in a narrow rift, out of which it now  glided in a blind purposeless way, writhing, whipping the herbage with  its tail, and tying itself in what seemed to be impossible knots.    \"Coffee and Chick go and kill um,\" said the latter, letting himself down  the face of the precipice, followed by his brother; and, apparently  quite without dread of the monster, they scrambled down over the rough  stones till they came to the serpent, when, watching his opportunity,  Coffee seized its tail and tried to drag it, but the creature seemed to  whip him off, and Coffee uttered a yell as he was driven staggering  back.    \"Go down, Dick, and try and give the monster another shot,\" said Mr  Rogers.  \"No, stop; I dare say the boys will finish it.\"    For just then, evidently enraged at the treatment his brother had  received, Chicory drove his assegai through the serpent, and then again  and again, the creature's struggles being blind of purpose, for its head  had been shattered by Dick's shot; while fiercely leaping up, Coffee  raised his own assegai, and holding it chopper fashion, he waited his  time till the serpent's head was handy, when he hewed it off.    The writhings now grew faint; and the General coming up, and descending  with Mr Rogers and his sons and the dogs, which kept making rushes at  the waving form and not biting it, the serpent was dragged out full  length and measured, Mr Rogers making seven fair paces by its side, and  setting it down at about eighteen feet in length.    \"A nice monster to meet, Master Dick,\" he said.  \"I congratulate you  upon your success.\"    \"Have it skinned, father,\" exclaimed Jack eagerly.  \"It would be such a  capital thing to have, stuffed and coiled up, at home.\"    Mr Rogers glanced at the great faintly-writhing monster, with its  tortoiseshell markings, and shook his head.    \"No, my boy,\" he said; \"I must confess to too great a dislike to the  serpent race to care to carry about their skins.  Besides, if we are  going on like this, killing a lion a day, we shall have only room for  the skins of our big game.  Let's leave the creature here.\"    They climbed up out of the ravine, and after a couple of hours' more  walking, full of interest if not of incident, they went slowly back,  glad to get in the shade of the trees beneath which the waggon was  halted, and finding everything right.
