He paused a little while,  and then he began again. \"They (i.e. the emigrants) know too well that  I am here, and they would like to assassinate me. I discover new  plots, new snares every day. They have sent to Corsica one of the  assassins of Georges, a wretch whom the English journals themselves  have pointed out to Europe as a blood-thirsty assassin; but let us be  on the alert. If he misses me, I won't miss him. I shall send my  grenadiers after him, and he shall be shot as an example to others.\"    After a few moments of silence, he said, \"Do my generals go to court?  they must cut a sad figure there.\" I waited for the end of this  digression, in order to resume the thread of my discourse. As I was  convinced that I could not possibly lead the conversation, I resolved  to let the Emperor have it according to his own way, and I answered,  \"Yes, Sire, and they are furious to see themselves superseded in  favour by emigrants who have never heard the sound of a cannon.\"--\"The  emigrants will never alter. As long as they were only required to  dance attendance in my anti-chamber, I had more than enough of them.  When it was necessary to show any heart, they slunk away like.... I  committed a great error, when I recalled that anti-national race into  France. If it had not been for me, they would have died of starvation  abroad; but then I had great motives. I wanted to reconcile Europe to  us, and to close the revolution.... What do my soldiers say about  me?\"--\"The soldiers, Sire, talk constantly about your immortal  victories. They never pronounce your name but with respect,  admiration, and grief. When the Princes give money to the soldiers,  they drink it out to your health, and when they are forced to cry  _Vive le Roi!_ they add in a whisper, _de Rome_.\"--\"And so they still  love me?\" (smiling.)--\"Yes, Sire, and I may even venture to say, more  than ever.\"--\"What do they say about our misfortunes?\"--\"They consider  them as the effect of treachery; and they constantly repeat, that they  never would have been conquered, if they had not been sold to their  enemies. They are particularly indignant with respect to the  capitulation of Paris.\"--\"They are right: had it not been for the  infamous defection of the Duke of Ragusa, the allies would have been  lost. I was master of their rear, and of all their resources; not a  man would have escaped. They too would have had their twenty-ninth  bulletin. Marmont is a wretch; he has ruined his country, and  delivered up his sovereign. His convention with Schwartzenburg would  alone suffice to dishonour him. If he had not known when he  surrendered, that he compromised my person and my army, he would not  have found it necessary to make stipulations in favour of my liberty  and life. This piece of treachery is not the only one. He has  intrigued with Talleyrand to take the regency from the Empress, and  the crown from my son. Caulincourt, Macdonald, and the rest of the  marshals, have been cheated and gulled by him in the most shameful  manner. All his blood would not be sufficient to expiate the harm  which he has done to France.... I will devote his name to the  execration of posterity. I am glad to learn that my soldiers retain  the feeling of their superiority, and that they attribute our great  misfortunes to the right authors. I collect with great pleasure, from  the intelligence which you have brought, that the opinion which I had  formed respecting the situation of France, is correct. The family of  the Bourbons is not fit to reign. Their government may be good for  priests, nobles, and old fashioned countesses: it is good for nothing  for the present generation. The revolution has taught the people to  know their rank in the state. They will never consent to fall back  into their former nullity, and to be tied up by the nobility and the  clergy. The army can never belong to the Bourbons. Our victories and  our misfortunes have established an indissoluble tie between the army  and myself. It is only through me that the soldiers can earn  vengeance, power, and glory. From the Bourbons they can get nothing  but insults and blows. Kings can only retain their power by the love  of their subjects or by fear. The Bourbons are neither loved nor  feared. At last they will throw themselves off their throne; but they  may yet retain their position for a long time. Frenchmen do not know  how to conspire.\"    In pronouncing these words, the Emperor continued walking hastily, and  using many gestures. He rather appeared to be soliloquizing than  addressing any one else; he then continued, looking at me aside, \"Does  M. X*** think that those people can stand much longer?\"--\"His opinion  on this point is exactly conformable to the general opinion; that is  to say, it is now the general impression and conviction, that the  government is hastening to its fall. The priests and the emigrants are  its only partisans; every man of patriotism or soul is its  enemy.\"--Napoleon (with energy), \"Yes, all men in whose veins any  national blood is flowing must be its enemies; but how will all this  end? Is it thought that there will be a new revolution?\"--\"Sire,  discontent and irritation prevail to such an extent, that the  slightest partial effervescence would inevitably cause a general  insurrection, and nobody would be surprised if it were to take place  to-morrow.\"--\"But what would you do were you to expel the Bourbons:  would you re-establish the republic?\"--\"The republic, Sire! nobody  thinks about it; perhaps they would create a regency.\"--Napoleon (with  vehemence and surprise), \"A regency! And wherefore? am I dead?\"--\"But  your absence....\"--\"My absence makes no difference. In a couple of  days I would be back again in France, if the nation were to recal me.  Do you think it would be well, if I were to return?\" The Emperor  turned away his eyes, and I could easily remark, that to this  question he attached more importance than he cared to manifest, and  that he expected my answer with anxiety. \"Sire, I dare not personally  attempt to answer such a question, but....\"--Napoleon (abruptly),  \"That's not what I am asking you; answer yes or no.\"--\"Why then,  Sire,--yes.\"--Napoleon (with tenderness), \"You really think  so?\"--\"Yes, Sire, I am convinced, and so is M. X****, that the people  and the army would receive you as their deliverer, and that your cause  would be embraced with enthusiasm.\"--Napoleon (appearing agitated and  impatient), \"Then X*** advises me to return?\"--\"We had foreseen that  your Majesty would make inquiries on this point, and the following is  literally his answer. You will tell his Majesty that I would not dare  to decide so important a question, but that he may consider it as a  positive and incontrovertible fact, that our present government has  wholly lost the confidence of the people and of the army; that  discontent has increased to the highest pitch, and that it is  impossible to believe that the government can stand much longer  against the universal dislike. You will add, that the Emperor is the  only object of the regret and hope of the nation. He, in his wisdom,  will decide what he ought to do.\"    The Emperor became silent and pensive; and, after a long meditation,  he said, \"I will reflect upon it; I will keep you with me. Come here  to-morrow at eleven o'clock.\"    On leaving the Emperor, I met the Grand Marshal, who said, \"the  Emperor has detained you a long time. I am in terror lest this  interview should have been noticed. We are surrounded by English  spies. The slightest indiscretion might cost us dear. I do not ask you  to relate to me any thing which was reserved for the Emperor; but if,  without violating your duty, you could give me any details relating to  France, you would be doing me a great favour. We hear nothing of what  is going forward, except from the journals and a few commercial  travellers; and the intelligence which we thus obtain is so trifling  and so contradictory, that we do not know what to make of it.\"--\"I can  satisfy you, Monsieur le Marechal, and without acting indiscreetly:  what I have told to the Emperor is known to all France. Discontent is  at its greatest height, and the royal government is on its last  legs.\"--\"I cannot tell what futurity promises to us; but whatever our  fate may be, we cannot be worse off than we are at present. Our  resources are dwindling away daily; we are becoming home-sick. If we  were not a little upheld by hope, I really do not know what would  become of us. Has the Emperor allowed you to remain with us?\"--\"Yes,  Monsieur le Marechal.\"--\"I give you joy, but I pity you. There is no  happiness out of one's own country. I do not regret having followed  the Emperor--this step was dictated to me by my duty and my gratitude;  but I regret France, like an infant who has lost its mother; like a  lover who has lost his mistress.\" The Grand Marshal's eyes were filled  with tears; he pressed my hand affectionately, and then said, \"Come  and breakfast with us to-morrow morning. I will introduce you to my  wife; it will be as good as a fete to her when she has an opportunity  of receiving a Frenchman, and above all, a true Frenchman.\"    It was soon known all over the town, that a Frenchman had arrived from  the continent. My inn was besieged by a crowd of officers and  grenadiers, who overwhelmed me with inquiries after their friends and  relations. They seemed to think that I must be acquainted with every  living creature in France. Many inquired respecting the state of  public affairs. I evaded their interrogatories, by declaring that I  had quitted France five months since.    I waited on the Grand Marshal according to his invitation. He resided  in one wing of the building occupied by the municipality. In his  apartment, there was hardly any thing to be seen except the four  walls. He took notice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#19)"],[1,"with deadly effect, knocking  great holes into the ships and killing scores of those on board.    The Spanish cruiser _Teresa_ was the first to succumb to the heavy  attack, and soon she turned in to shore to save her crew from drowning.  Then the _Oquendo_ caught fire in several places, and burning fiercely  from stem to stern, she, too, turned in.    But two ships were now left to Admiral Cervera, the _Vizcaya_ and the  _Colon_, and each had suffered much. Both were doing their best to get  out of reach of our guns and the marvellous accuracy of our gunners.    \"Don't let 'em get away!\" was the cry. \"Give 'em what Dewey did!\"  Forward went the war-ships of Uncle Sam, the powerful _Oregon_ leading,  with the _Brooklyn_ and _Texas_ not far behind. The rain of steel  continued, and at last, burning like her sister ships, the _Vizcaya_  turned shoreward, and many of her crew leaped overboard to save their  lives.    Only the _Colon_ now remained. She was still in fair condition, and it  was the Spaniards' ardent hope to save at least one ship from the dire  calamity that had overtaken them. But this was not to be, and after a  run of a few miles, during which the _Oregon_ and _Brooklyn_ continued  to pound her with shot and shell, the Spanish flag was lowered, and the  _Colon_ also ran ashore.    It was assuredly a mighty victory, a fitting mate to the great victory  won by Admiral Dewey, and when the news reached our country there was  such a Fourth of July celebration everywhere as will never be forgotten.  Twice had our navy met the ships of Spain, and each time we had sunk  every vessel without losing any of our own. More than this, while the  Spaniards had lost many men through shot and fire and drowning, our  total loss was but one man killed and a handful wounded.    The loss of her second fleet was a bitter blow to Spain, and many  predicted that the war would not continue much longer, and this  prediction proved correct.    During the rush made by the Rough Riders and our other soldiers, they  had gone right through several bodies of Spanish guerillas who were  secreted in the trees of the jungle. These guerillas, really lawless  fellows belonging to no particular command, could not get back into  Santiago because of the strong American guard at the intrenchments, and  consequently they contented themselves with remaining out of sight and  peppering our soldiers whenever the opportunity offered.    \"This will not do,\" said Theodore Roosevelt. \"They are shooting down our  men without giving them a chance to fire back. We'll have to get after  them.\" And without delay he sent out a detachment of the best Rough  Rider shots to be found. These sharpshooters searched the jungle back of  the intrenchments thoroughly, and as a result killed eleven of the  guerillas and wounded many more. After that the guerillas kept their  distance, satisfied that the Yankees could beat them at their own game.          CHAPTER XVII    DEVOTION OF THE ROUGH RIDERS TO THEODORE ROOSEVELT--HIS KINDNESS TO HIS  MEN--LAST OF THE FIGHTING--THE TRUCE AND TREATY OF PEACE      With the defeat of Admiral Cervera's fleet, a flag of truce was sent  into Santiago by the commander of our army, demanding the surrender of  the city. While these negotiations were pending, all fighting came to an  end, and the Rough Riders had but little to do outside of making  themselves comfortable and caring for the many who were getting sick  because of the lack of shelter and proper food. Food was now coming in  more rapidly, and soon all were supplied with tents and blankets. During  this time Theodore Roosevelt's personal baggage appeared, and he  celebrated the arrival by treating himself to a shave and a change of  linen, something impossible to do since the fighting had begun.    In his own writings, Mr. Roosevelt has spoken at great length of the  devotion which all of the Rough Riders displayed toward him. They were  anxious to wait on him at all hours of the day and night. Some would  pitch his tent, others would clean his weapons, and still others would  go hunting and bring in such game as the vicinity afforded. When ordered  to do anything, there was rarely a grumble. Those in the hospital bore  their sufferings with remarkable fortitude.    In return for this, Theodore Roosevelt did all he could to make life  less hard for those under him. The game that was brought to him he sent  to the hospital, that the wounded might have proper nourishment; and he  either went himself or sent somebody to the seacoast, to purchase food  which the commissary department possessed, but which, through lack of  organization, it was slow in distributing. When no shelter was to be  had, he slept on the ground with his men, and when they had to work on  the trenches at night, he was up and around superintending the labor.    \"He was one of us, and he let us know it,\" was said by one of the Rough  Riders. \"He ate the same food we did, and he was mighty good to the  sick and the wounded. He paid for lots of things out of his own pocket,  and I don't believe he has ever asked Uncle Sam to pay him back.\"    There was no telling how soon the truce would come to an end and  fighting would begin again, and night after night the Rough Riders were  kept on guard. There was a standing order that each fourth man should  keep awake while the others slept, and no matter how dark or rainy the  night, Theodore Roosevelt tramped around from one trench to another,  seeing to it that this order was obeyed. He also visited the  intrenchments of other commands, to compare them and make certain that  the grade of service was equally high among the Rough Riders. This shows  distinctly that he was a natural-born military commander.    The truce lasted a week, and while all operations were supposed to have  come to an end, both the Americans and the Spaniards spent the time in  strengthening their positions. At one time the Americans constructed a  fairly good defence, in which they placed two Gatling guns and two  automatic Colt guns, and this was named Fort Roosevelt, in honor of the  Rough Rider commander.    On the tenth of July the fighting began once more, and again the  batteries on both sides sent shot and shell into the camps of the enemy.  It was largely fighting at long range, and the only Rough Riders who  took part were those who manned the Colt's guns, and a small body of  sharpshooters stationed in a trench well to the front.    On the next day the Rough Riders were ordered northward, to guard the  road running from Santiago to El Caney. Here some fighting was in  progress, and the troopers expected to get into battle once more. But  the skirmish came to an end before they arrived, very much to their  disappointment.    Hardly had the Rough Riders settled in their new position than a storm  came up which proved to be the heaviest yet experienced during the  campaign. While Theodore Roosevelt was sleeping in his tent, the shelter  was blown down and away, and all of his personal effects were scattered  in the mud and wet. As best he could, he donned his clothing, saw to it  that his men were safe, and then betook himself to a kitchen tent,  where he finished the sleep of that night on a rude table recently taken  from an abandoned Spanish home in that vicinity.    \"On that night it rained cats and dogs and hammer-handles,\" said one of  the soldiers afterward. \"It was inky dark--darker than I have ever known  it to be anywhere on the plains. The water made a muddy pond of the  whole camp, and the trenches were half filled in no time. Everything was  blown helter-skelter by the furious wind, and some of our outfits we  never recovered. In the midst of the confusion some fellows reported  that the Spaniards were trying to break through our lines, but the  report was false,--the outsiders were starving Cubans who had come in  looking for shelter and something to eat. We gave them what we  could--which was precious little, for we had next to nothing  ourselves--and then got them to help us get things together again. One  of the Cubans was an old man, who could speak a little English. He said  he had lost two daughters and three grandchildren by starvation since  the war between Spain and Cuba had started. He himself was little more  than a skeleton.\"    That Theodore Roosevelt was warmhearted enough to look out for other  soldiers besides those of his own command is proven by what took place  on the day following the big storm. Next to the Rough Riders were  located a regiment of Illinois Volunteers. Because of the muddy roads  and swollen streams, they could get no rations, and scant as were their  own supplies, Colonel Roosevelt had the Rough Riders furnish them with  beans, coffee, and a few cases of hardtack, for which they were  extremely grateful. Later in the day the commander of the Rough Riders  also got to them part of a mule train of provisions.    The American position had been greatly strengthened, and many additional  troops were now at the front. It was felt that an advance upon Santiago  would surely result in victory, although the losses might be large. But  the Spaniards were no longer in a position to continue the struggle, and  on July 17 the city formally surrendered. The surrendered territory  covered many miles, and the Spanish soldiers to lay down their arms  numbered upward of twenty thousand.    There was great cheering in the American trenches when the glad news was  brought in, and soon Old Glory was planted on every height, while the  trumpets sounded out triumphantly. Possession of Santiago was immediate,  and in a few hours the Stars and Stripes floated from the flagstaff of  the civil government buildings. Our gallant army had won on the land  just as our gallant navy had won on the sea. The war had been, for us,  one of triumph from start to finish.    In foreign countries the news was received with an astonishment that can  scarcely be"]]]
