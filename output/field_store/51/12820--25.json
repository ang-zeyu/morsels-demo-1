This did not suit Brithnoth, and he went on to Ely.  There the whole company was hospitably entertained; and Brithnoth was so  pleased that he on the next day made over to the monastery a number of  manors into their immediate possession, and also assigned certain  others, on condition that if he should be slain in battle his body  should be buried at Ely. In the battle the English forces were  outnumbered, and Brithnoth fell, the Danes taking his head away with  them in their triumph. On hearing of his death, the abbot and some of  the monks went to the scene of the engagement, recovered the body, and  interred it with all honour in their church.    A great accession of dignity was granted by King Ethelred. While his  brother, King Edward, was on the throne, Ethelred, with his mother, had  visited the tomb of S. Etheldreda, and professed great admiration for  her character and work. When Ethelred became king he granted to the  churches of Ely, Canterbury, and Glastonbury the office of Chancellor of  the King's Court, putting, as it were, the office in commission; so the  abbot of each place, or his deputy, officiated as chancellor for periods  of four months each. This privilege was only retained till the time of  the Normans.    Elsin died in a good old age, \"after a life of great sanctity and  observance of the commandments of God, and after the acquisition of much  honour and great possessions to the church.\" His death took place,  according to the \"Liber Eliensis,\" in King Ethelred's time--that is, not  later than 1016. Wharton gives 1019 as the date. Possibly the unsettled  state of the kingdom may have caused the abbey to be vacant for three  years.    At the Battle of Assendun, 1016, some of the monks of Ely, as well as  Ednod, Bishop of Dorchester, and the Abbot of Ramsey, were slain. The  Ely monks took with them to the camp the relics of S. Wendreda, which  were there lost and never recovered. Canute is thought to have acquired  them, and to have bestowed them upon the Church of Canterbury. The body  of Bishop Ednod was brought to Ely, with the intention of taking it on  to Ramsey, where he had been abbot, for interment. But when the body  arrived at Ely it was buried privately by night in the church.    Of #Leofwin#, called also Oschitel (1019?-1022), who is given in the  lists as the third abbot, nothing whatever is known, except that he was  deposed by the monks, and reinstated, after a journey to Rome, by the  pope.    His successor, #Leofric# (1022-1029), who had been prior, is  remembered only as being abbot when Archbishop Wulstan of York and  Bishop Alfwin of Elmham were buried at Ely, and when divers possessions  were acquired by gift or bequest of a certain Countess Godiva.    #Leofsin# (1029-1045), like his predecessor, was appointed by King  Canute. Canute was much in the eastern counties; and he is said to have  made a point, when possible, of keeping the Feast of the Purification at  Ely, that being the date on which the abbot's turn as chancellor  commenced. It was on one of these occasions, while coming by water with  his queen and nobles, that the remarkable incident occurred of his  hearing the monks singing in the distance, and breaking out himself into  verse. Four lines of his song have been preserved.[9] The Latin of  them, as given in the \"Liber Eliensis,\" runs thus:      \"Dulce cantaverunt monachi in Ely    Dum Canutus rex navigaret prope ibi,    Nunc milites navigate propius ad terram,    Et simul audiamus monachorum harmoniam.\"    The incident has attracted many writers, and not a few poems have been  written upon it. Wordsworth's sonnet on the subject commences:      \"A pleasant music floats along the mere.    From monks in Ely chanting service high,    While as Canute the king is rowing by:    'My oarsmen,' quoth the mighty king, 'draw near,    That we the sweet song of the monks may hear.'\"    And in a ballad upon Chelsea, a quarter of New York where the General  Theological Seminary of the American church is situated, a poet of that  communion has these verses:      \"When old Canute the Dane      Was merry England's king,    A thousand years agone, and more,      As ancient rymours sing,    His boat was rowing down the Ouse,      At eve, one summer day,    Where Ely's tall cathedral peered      Above the glassy way.    Anon, sweet music on his ear,      Comes floating from the fane,    And listening, as with all his soul      Sat old Canute the Dane;    And reverent did he doff his crown,      To join the clerkly prayer,    While swelled old lauds and litanies      Upon the stilly air.\"[10]    Ely minster was, however, not a cathedral in Canute's time; and it is a  strange poetical licence that can describe an evening just before the  Feast of the Purification as a \"summer day.\"    Perhaps the greatest distinction belonging to the monastery at this  period was the honour of having educated King Edward the Confessor. He  had been brought here in his infancy and offered by his parents on the  altar; \"and it was a constant tradition with the Monks that he used to  take great delight in learning to sing Psalms and godly Hymns, among the  children of his own age, in the Cloister, on which account he always  retained a favourable regard to the place, after he became King.\"[11] In  1036, the year after Canute's death, Edward and his brother Alfred came  over from Normandy to England, ostensibly to visit their mother, Queen  Emma, who lived at Winchester, but really to ascertain the feeling of  the nation with regard to the succession to the throne. Alfred fell into  the hands of Earl Godwin, by whose orders he was deprived of his eyes  and committed to the custody of the monks of Ely. He lived a very short  time after this cruel treatment, and died and was buried at Ely.    Abbot #Wilfric# (1045-1065) came from Winchester. He was a kinsman of  Edward the Confessor. Through this relationship, as well as from  personal connection with the place, the king greatly favoured the abbey.  He granted a confirmatory charter himself, and obtained a bull from the  pope confirming all the rights and privileges of the church. But several  of the possessions of the abbey were lost in Wilfric's time. In one  instance the High Constable of England seized a village belonging to the  monks. Proceedings were taken against him and sentence pronounced; but  he evaded even the king's orders, and at last actually secured the  possession of the village for his own life, after which it was to revert  to the true owners. After the Conquest, however, all the lands of this  nobleman were seized by the Conqueror, this village among the rest; nor  could the Church of Ely ever regain it. In another instance Abbot  Wilfric himself was the cause of the loss of much landed property. In  order to advance his brother he conveyed to him, without the consent of  the monastery, several estates. Upon discovery, the abbot withdrew from  Ely in sorrow and disgrace, and soon fell sick and died. As in the  previous case, a composition was effected between Guthmund, the late  abbot's brother, and the monks, whereby he was to retain the lands for  his life. But, as before, these lands were alienated after the Conquest,  and never recovered.    Abbot #Thurstan# (1066-1072) was appointed by King Harold, and was  the last Saxon abbot. He was a native of the Isle of Ely, having been  born at Witchford. He naturally took the part of Edgar Atheling--whom he  regarded as the rightful heir after Harold was killed--against William  the Conqueror. He gave every support to the many who gathered together  in the isle as to a fastness, and encouraged the plans of Hereward. When  the cause of the English seemed hopeless, the monks endeavoured to  persuade the soldiers to surrender; not being successful, they sent  messengers to the king assuring him of their sorrow at having taken part  against him, and promising to behave better in future. Afterwards the  abbot himself went, and gave the king much information about the place,  and the best method of subduing it. But when the isle was finally  subdued, the king signified his great displeasure at the behaviour of  the monks, and exacted a heavy fine. He is said to have gone in person  to the minster, after his victory, and to have made an offering at the  altar; but the monks were under such strict surveillance, and the king's  visit was so secret, that no one knew of his coming till after he was  gone. Thurstan escaped deprivation by his complete submission and  prudent conduct, and remained abbot till his death in 1072. But it  appears that the monks had not thoroughly made their peace with the  Conqueror by the time of Abbot Thurstan's death, for we read, \"Eodem  anno monachi Elienses, quibusdam Anglorum magnatibus contra regem  Willelmum rebellantibus succursum praebentes, exlegati sunt.\"[12]    He was succeeded by a Norman, #Theodwin# (1072-1075), a monk of  Jumieges. This was a Benedictine abbey of great repute in the diocese of  Rouen. Its church had been built during the abbacy of Robert, afterwards  Archbishop of Canterbury; and he died and was buried at Jumieges.  Theodwin was present at the Council of London in 1075. He died the same  year.    For upwards of six years the affairs of the monastery were administered  by Godfrey, one of the monks. He was an able and efficient  administrator. In his time the king sent a number of knights and  gentlemen to live at Ely, and he supported them out of the revenues of  the house. The names and armorial bearings of these pensioners are  preserved in a curious painting called the \"Tabula Eliensis,\" now in the  palace. This is a copy, as it is said, of one formerly in the refectory.  It cannot be earlier than the fifteenth century. There are in it forty  compartments, in each of which is represented a knight and a monk, the  names of both being given "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#19)"],[1,"that {178} continually went  on in the various legislatures when the subject was brought up.  This  gentleman, George Shiras, 3rd, planned to cut the Gordian knot by  turning over to the Federal Government the entire subject of making  laws regarding the killing of migratory game birds.    In December that year he introduced a bill in Congress covering his  ideas on the subject.  This radical proposition created merriment in  certain legal circles.  Was it not written in the statutes of nearly  every state that the birds and game belong to the people of the state?  Therefore what had the Government to do with the subject?  Furthermore,  were there not numerous court decisions upholding the authority of the  states in their declarations of ownership of the birds and game?  Others saw in this move only another attempt toward increasing the  power of the central government, and depriving the states further of  their inalienable rights.  This remarkable document was discussed to  some extent but nothing was done.  Four years later {179} Congressman  John W. Weeks reintroduced the bill with slight modifications.  Nothing  came of this any more than of the bill that he started going in 1909.  In 1911 he again brought forward this pet measure toward which Congress  had so often turned a cold shoulder.  Senator George P. McLean set a  similar bill afloat in the troubled waters of the Senate.  Nothing  happened, however, until the spring of 1912, when committee hearings  were given on these bills in both branches of Congress.  Representatives of more than thirty organizations interested in  conservation appeared and eloquently sought to impress the national  lawmakers with the importance and desirability of the measure.  Both  bills were intended for the protection of migratory game birds only,  but the representative of the National Association of Audubon Societies  urged that the bills be extended to include all migratory insect-eating  birds, because of their value to agriculture.  This suggestion was  adopted and after a stiff fight in Congress the McLean Bill became a  law on March 4, 1913.    {180}    This new federal statute did not in itself change any of the existing  game laws, but it gave authority to certain functionaries to make such  regulations as they deemed wise, necessary, and proper to extend better  protection to all migratory game and insect-eating birds in the United  States.  The Secretary of Agriculture, to whose department this unusual  duty was assigned, read the law thoughtfully, concluded that the task  did not come within the bounds of his personal capabilities, and very  wisely turned the whole matter over to a committee of three experts  chosen from one of the department bureaus and known as the Biological  Survey.    _The Work of the Committee._--This committee at once began the  preparation of a series of regulations to give effect to the new  statute.  Drawing extensively from the records stored in the Survey  offices, and seasoning these with their own good judgment and knowledge  of existing conditions, they brought out in a period of three months  and nine days, or to be more precise, on June 23, 1913, a set of ten  {181} regulations which, in many ways, have revolutionized shooting in  the United States.    These were printed in pamphlet form and distributed widely; for before  they could have the effect of laws it was necessary that they should be  advertised for a period of at least three months in order to give all  dissatisfied parties an opportunity to be heard.    The whole idea of the Government taking over the matter of protecting  migratory birds, as well as the startling character of some of the  regulations promulgated by the committee was justly expected to bring  forth either great shouts of approbation or a storm of disapproval, and  possibly both sounds might be heard.  As long experience has shown that  it is necessary to have public opinion approve of a game law if it is  to be effective, one can well understand that, following the mailing of  the circular of rules, these gentlemen of the committee stood with hand  to brow and anxiously scanned the distant horizon.  Nor did they have  long to wait before {182} critical rumblings began to be heard in many  directions, for it is always hard for men to give up privileges which  they have once enjoyed.    In fact, as the committee waited, the sky began rapidly to fill with  interrogation points; for it has ever been the case that the  dissatisfied ones of earth are louder in their objections than are the  satisfied ones in their commendations.    As a matter of fact, the regulations on the whole were remarkable for  their clearness, directness, and fairness.  They came nearer being  formed for the benefit of the birds instead of for the pleasure and  convenience of the hunters, than any general far-reaching  bird-protective measure, which has been enacted in this country.    For the purpose of the regulations, migratory game birds were defined  as Ducks, Geese, Swans, Rails, Coots, Pigeons, Cranes, and shore birds,  which included Plover, Snipe, Woodcock, and Sandpipers.  Migratory  insectivorous birds were enumerated as Thrushes, Orioles, Larks,  Swallows, Wrens, {183} Woodpeckers, and all other perching birds that  feed entirely or chiefly on insects.    Having thus conveniently classified migratory birds into two easily  comprehensible and distinguishable groups, the way was open to deal  with them separately and distinctively.  Therefore, after declaring it  to be illegal to kill any bird of either class between sunset and  sunrise, the regulations went on to state that insect-eating birds  shall not be killed in any place or in any manner, even in the daytime.    Among other things this provision, by one stroke, completed the  campaign which the Audubon Society had been waging for long years on  behalf of the Robin.  In Maryland, North Carolina, Mississippi,  Louisiana and Tennessee, the Robin-potpie-loving inhabitants must in  future content themselves with such game birds as Quail, Grouse, Wild  Turkeys, and Ducks.  The life of Sir Robin Redbreast has now been  declared to be sacred everywhere.  He and his mate are to dwell beneath  the protection of the strong arm of the United States Government.    {184} Another feature of the Audubon work was also completed by this  section of the new regulations.  This is the safeguarding of all song  and insect-eating birds in the States of Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Utah,  Arizona, Nebraska, Kansas, and New Mexico, constituting the group of  states whose legislatures had thus far withstood the importunities of  the Audubon workers to extend protection to such birds.    Regulation Number Four provided for an absolute closed hunting season  on sixty-two species of water birds until September, 1918.    The above includes what we might call some of the minor regulations  proposed by the Biological Survey Committee.  Then comes the big  regulation, the one which was of absorbing interest to every member of  the vast army of five million hunters in the United States.  This is  the regulation which divides the country into zones and prescribes the  shooting seasons in each.  Touching on this point the Government  experts already mentioned gave out this statement by way of explanation:    {185}    _Government Explanations._--\"More than fifty separate seasons for  migratory birds were provided under statutes in force in 1912.  This  multiplicity of regulations of zones to suit special localities has  apparently had anything but a beneficial effect on the abundance of  game.  The effort to provide special seasons for each kind of game in  each locality merely makes a chain of open seasons for migratory birds  and allows the continued destruction of such birds from the beginning  of the first season to the close of the last.  It is believed that  better results will follow the adoption of the fewest possible number  of zones and so regulating the seasons in each as to include the time  when such species is in the best condition or at the maximum of  abundance during the autumn.  For this reason the country has been  divided into two zones, as nearly equal as possible, one to include the  states in which migratory game birds breed, or would breed if given  reasonable protection, the other the states in which comparatively few  species breed, but in which many winter.  {186} Within these zones the  seasons are fixed for the principal natural groups, water fowl, Rails,  shore birds, and Woodcock.  In no case does the zone boundary cross a  state line, and except in very rare cases the seasons are uniform  throughout the states.\"    With few changes the regulations were finally adopted.  Wherever the  federal law conflicted with a state law, the former was regarded as  supreme, and to make things more generally uniform the states have  since been changing their laws to conform to the Government  regulations.  After being tried out for three years these rules  recently were modified by making five shooting zones and altering  certain other provisions.  These last regulations which became  effective on August 21, 1916, to-day stand as the law of the land  affecting migratory birds.    To the United States Biological Survey was intrusted the task of  enforcing the law by means of game wardens and other officials.  That  is, the survey was to collect the evidence in cases of violations, and  the prosecutions were to be conducted {187} by the Department of  Justice.  To enable these officials to execute the law, Congress has  appropriated $50,000 annually--which is just about one tenth the  minimum amount needed for the purpose.  This paltry sum has been  expended as judiciously as possible with marked results for good.  Trouble, however, soon developed in the courts.  One autumn day Harvey  C. Schauver went a-hunting on Big Lake, Arkansas, and finding no Ducks  handy he shot a Coot, which"]]]
