BATESON, M.A., F.R.S.    _Professor of Biology in the University of Cambridge_      Darwin's work has the property of greatness in that it may be admired  from more aspects than one. For some the perception of the principle  of Natural Selection stands out as his most wonderful achievement to  which all the rest is subordinate. Others, among whom I would range  myself, look up to him rather as the first who plainly distinguished,  collected, and comprehensively studied that new class of evidence from  which hereafter a true understanding of the process of Evolution may  be developed. We each prefer our own standpoint of admiration; but I  think that it will be in their wider aspect that his labours will most  command the veneration of posterity.    A treatise written to advance knowledge may be read in two moods. The  reader may keep his mind passive, willing merely to receive the  impress of the writer's thought; or he may read with his attention  strained and alert, asking at every instant how the new knowledge can  be used in a further advance, watching continually for fresh footholds  by which to climb higher still. Of Shelley it has been said that he  was a poet for poets: so Darwin was a naturalist for naturalists. It  is when his writings are used in the critical and more exacting spirit  with which we test the outfit for our own enterprise that we learn  their full value and strength. Whether we glance back and compare his  performance with the efforts of his predecessors, or look forward  along the course which modern research is disclosing, we shall honour  most in him not the rounded merit of finite accomplishment, but the  creative power by which he inaugurated a line of discovery endless in  variety and extension. Let us attempt thus to see his work in true  perspective between the past from which it grew, and the present which  is its consequence. Darwin attacked the problem of Evolution by  reference to facts of three classes: Variation; Heredity; Natural  Selection. His work was not as the laity suppose, a sudden and  unheralded revelation, but the first fruit of a long and hitherto  barren controversy. The occurrence of variation from type, and the  hereditary transmission of such variation had of course been long  familiar to practical men, and inferences as to the possible bearing  of those phenomena on the nature of specific difference had been from  time to time drawn by naturalists. Maupertuis, for example, wrote: \"Ce  qui nous reste a examiner, c'est comment d'un seul individu, il a pu  naitre tant d'especes si differentes.\" And again: \"La Nature contient  le fonds de toutes ces varietes: mais le hasard ou l'art les mettent  en oeuvre. C'est ainsi que ceux dont l'industrie s'applique a  satisfaire le gout des curieux, sont, pour ainsi dire, createurs  d'especes nouvelles.\"[56]    Such passages, of which many (though few so emphatic) can be found in  eighteenth century writers, indicate a true perception of the mode of  Evolution. The speculations hinted at by Buffon,[57] developed by  Erasmus Darwin, and independently proclaimed above all by Lamarck,  gave to the doctrine of descent a wide renown. The uniformitarian  teaching which Lyell deduced from geological observation had gained  acceptance. The facts of geographical distribution[58] had been shown  to be obviously inconsistent with the Mosaic legend. Prichard, and  Lawrence, following the example of Blumenbach, had successfully  demonstrated that the races of Man could be regarded as different  forms of one species, contrary to the opinion up till then received.  These treatises all begin, it is true, with a profound obeisance to  the sons of Noah, but that performed, they continue on strictly modern  lines. The question of the mutability of species was thus prominently  raised.    Those who rate Lamarck no higher than did Huxley in his contemptuous  phrase \"_buccinator tantum_,\" will scarcely deny that the sound of the  trumpet had carried far, or that its note was clear. If then there  were few who had already turned to evolution with positive conviction,  all scientific men must at least have known that such views had been  promulgated; and many must, as Huxley says, have taken up his own  position of \"critical expectancy.\"[59]    Why, then, was it, that Darwin succeeded where the rest had failed?  The cause of that success was twofold. First, and obviously, in the  principle of Natural Selection he had a suggestion which would work.  It might not go the whole way, but it was true as far as it went.  Evolution could thus in great measure be fairly represented as a  consequence of demonstrable processes. Darwin seldom endangers the  mechanism he devised by putting on it strains much greater than it can  bear. He at least was under no illusion as to the omnipotence of  Selection; and he introduces none of the forced pleading which in  recent years has threatened to discredit that principle.        For example, in the latest text of the _Origin_[60] we find him  saying:         \"But as my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented,       and it has been stated that I attribute the modification of       species exclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted       to remark that in the first edition of this work, and       subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous       position--namely, at the close of the Introduction--the       following words: 'I am convinced that natural selection has       been the main but not the exclusive means of modification.'\"    But apart from the invention of this reasonable hypothesis, which may  well, as Huxley estimated, \"be the guide of biological and  psychological speculation for the next three or four generations,\"  Darwin made a more significant and imperishable contribution. Not for  a few generations, but through all ages he should be remembered as the  first who showed clearly that the problems of Heredity and Variation  are soluble by observation, and laid down the course by which we must  proceed to their solution.[61] The moment of inspiration did not come  with the reading of Malthus, but with the opening of the \"first  note-book on Transmutation of Species.\"[62] Evolution is a process of  Variation and Heredity. The older writers, though they had some vague  idea that it must be so, did not study Variation and Heredity. Darwin  did, and so begat not a theory, but a science.    The extent to which this is true, the scientific world is only  beginning to realise. So little was the fact appreciated in Darwin's  own time that the success of his writings was followed by an almost  total cessation of work in that special field. Of the causes which led  to these remarkable consequences I have spoken elsewhere. They  proceeded from circumstances peculiar to the time; but whatever the  causes there is no doubt that this statement of the result is  historically exact, and those who make it their business to collect  facts elucidating the physiology of Heredity and Variation are well  aware that they will find little to reward their quest in the leading  scientific Journals of the Darwinian epoch.    In those thirty years the original stock of evidence current and in  circulation even underwent a process of attrition. As in the story of  the Eastern sage who first wrote the collected learning of the  universe for his sons in a thousand volumes and by successive  compression and burning reduced them to one and from this by further  burning distilled the single ejaculation of the Faith \"There is no god  but God and Mohammed is the Prophet of God,\" which was all his maturer  wisdom deemed essential:--so in the books of that period do we find  the _corpus_ of genetic knowledge dwindle to a few prerogative  instances and these at last to the brief formula of an unquestioned  creed.    And yet in all else that concerns biological science this period was,  in very truth, our Golden Age, when the natural history of the earth  was explored as never before; morphology and embryology were  exhaustively ransacked; the physiology of plants and animals began to  rival chemistry and physics in precision of method and in the rapidity  of its advances; and the foundations of pathology were laid.    In contrast with this immense activity elsewhere the neglect which  befel the special physiology of Descent, or Genetics as we now call  it, is astonishing. This may of course be interpreted as meaning that  the favoured studies seemed to promise a quicker return for effort,  but it would be more true to say that those who chose these other  pursuits did so without making any such comparison; for the idea that  the physiology of Heredity and Variation was a coherent science,  offering possibilities of extraordinary discovery, was not present to  their minds at all. In a word, the existence of such a science was  well nigh forgotten. It is true that in ancillary periodicals, as for  example those that treat of entomology or horticulture, or in the  writings of the already isolated systematists,[63] observations with  this special bearing were from time to time related, but the class of  fact on which Darwin built his conceptions of Heredity and Variation  was not seen in the highways of biology. It formed no part of the  official curriculum of biological students, and found no place among  the subjects which their teachers were investigating.    During this period nevertheless one distinct advance was made, that  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#19)"],[1,"IN THE PACIFIC.    A curious result of the world war has been the expeditions initiated  by the great oversea dominions of Britain and by India. The work of  two of these, in Africa and Mesopotamia, has been already described.  There remain the joint Australian and New Zealand expeditions against  the island colonies of Germany and the great semi-continental area of  New Guinea.    A lively account of the expedition against the Samoa Islands is  printed in The Sydney Bulletin for Sept. 24:         The recent expedition to Samoa furnished many surprises,       chief among which was the adaptability of the Maorilanders       to military discipline. When the men came on board the       transports (Moeraki and Monowai) discipline simply wasn't in       their dictionaries. They acknowledged orders with a \"Right       O, Sport,\" or with an argument. Companies were referred to       as mobs, the commanding officer as the boss or the       admiral....         The night before we reached Samoa an English military       officer on board told me it was remarkable, and highly       creditable, the rapidity with which the men had adapted       themselves to the changed circumstances....         The expedition called at Noumea to pick up the French       warship Montcalm, also the Australia and Melbourne of ours.       Noumea had been very worried since the war began, lest the       German fleet from Samoa would come along and bombard the       place. Had notices up to the effect that five shots would       signify the arrival of the Germans, and that every       inhabitant was then to grab rations and make for the       horizon. The welcome the French handed to us would have       stirred the blood of a jellyfish.         Samoa proved a walk-over. Not a gun, not a ship, not a mine.       A bunch of schoolboys with Shanghais and a hatful of rocks       could have taken it. The German fleet that was supposed to       be waiting to welcome us hadn't been around for eleven       months. Seemingly the German fleet has gone into the       business of not being around.      VIII. GERMAN NEW GUINEA.    The Australasian (Melbourne) for Sept. 19 prints the following,  describing the conquest of German New Guinea, which, with the Bismarck  Archipelago, off the coast, has an area of 90,000 square  miles--something less than half the size of the German Empire:         The Minister for Defense (Mr. Millen) has received the       following further information by wireless regarding the       operations at Herbertshohe and Rabaul, from Admiral Patey:       The Australian naval reserve captured the wireless station       at Herbertshohe at 1 P.M. on Sept. 12, after eighteen hours'       bush fighting over about six miles. Herbertshohe and Rabaul,       the seat of Government, have been garrisoned and a base has       been established at Simpsonshafen.         Have prisoners: German officers, 2, including commandant;       German non-commissioned officers, 15; and native police, 56.       German casualties about 20 to 30 killed. Simpsonshafen swept       and ready to be entered Sept. 12.         Naval force landed under Commander Beresford of the       Australian Navy met with vigorous opposition. Advanced party       at dawn established landing before enemy aware of intention.       From within a few hundred yards of landing bush fight for       almost four miles. Roads and fronts also mined in places,       and stations intrenched. Officer commanding German forces in       trench 500 yards seaward side of station has surrendered       unconditionally.         Our force have reconnoitred enemy strength holding station.       Have landed 12-pounder guns, and if station does not       surrender intend shelling. Regret to report following       casualties: 4 killed, 3 wounded.    Later a wireless message from Rear-Admiral Sir George Patey informed  the Minister for Defense (Mr. E.D. Millen) on Monday, Sept. 14, that,  as a result of the operations of the Australian Expeditionary Force,  Rabaul, the seat of government in German New Guinea, had been  occupied. The British flag was hoisted over the town at 3:30 on Sunday  afternoon (Sept. 13, 1914) and it was saluted. A proclamation was then  read by Rear-Admiral Patey, formerly setting out the occupation.    Apia (Samoa) had been occupied by British forces on Aug. 29. The  Caroline Islands, first occupied by Japan, were turned over to New  Zealand. The Marshall and Solomon Islands were likewise occupied on  Dec. 9, thus completing the tale of Germany's colonial possessions in  the Pacific.    There remain large areas in Kamerun and East Africa, but in both cases  the coast line is in the possession of the Entente powers.      IX. FIGHTING IN THE CAUCASUS.    The first considerable battle in the Caucasus, after Turkey entered  the war, was decided in favor of Russia, on Jan. 3. On Jan. 16 the  Eleventh Corps of the Turkish Army was cut up at Kara Urgaun. On Jan.  30 the Russians occupied Tabriz. On Feb. 8 Trebizond was bombarded by  Russian destroyers. On May 4 the Turks were again defeated, leaving  3,500 dead.    The most recent considerable action was the taking of the ancient and  important City of Van, which is graphically described in Novoe Vremya,  June 19:         \"When our armies scattered the forces of Halil Bey and       gained marked successes in the western part of Azerbijan,       the question of taking Van and the more important towns on       Lake Van arose. At the same time we received news of the       desperate situation of the Christians (Armenians) of the Van       vilayet, who had been compelled to take up arms against the       Kurds.         \"Our division was directed to go to Van through the Sanjak       of Bajazet, crossing the Tatar Pass under fire of Turkish       regulars and Kurds. In spite of the Spring season, the whole       pass was covered with a thick carpet of snow, in places up       to our men's belts. At the highest point of the pass, 10,000       feet, we were forced to halt. After a brief rest we reached       Taparitz and were immediately in contact with the enemy, who       attacked with shell and rifle fire, but we soon silenced       them with our rifles and machine guns. Scattering, the Turks       and Kurds hid among the rocks and sniped at us.         \"From Taparitz we advanced much more rapidly along the Abaga       Valley, then turned to the west along the River       Bendimach-Su, the best route to Van. We were informed that       Begri-Kala was strongly occupied by Turks who were       determined to defend it to the last.         \"They began an irregular fire, which soon developed into a       hotly contested battle. We were compelled to reply with       bullet and bayonet. We took several mountain guns, many       rifles and cartridges and much ammunition. Many of the       enemy threw up their hands and surrendered. We liberated       several dozen Christian girls who had been captured by the       Kurds at the time of the Turk and Kurd raid on the Armenian       villages.         \"We then resumed our march on Van, after driving the Turks       from the Village of Sor. The enemy gathered in the Town of       Janik, one march from Van, on the northeast shore of Lake       Van. To take Janik cost us several days' fighting. The Turks       fought desperately, undaunted by enormous losses, their dead       falling in heaps on all sides. The Turkish infantry fought a       brave and honorable fight, but the Kurds are foul fighters,       murdering and looting.         \"Attacking directly with only a part of our forces, we sent       the rest by a long detour around the enemy's position,       taking the Turks in flank; then our men charged with the       bayonet, and the fight was over.    [Illustration: Scene of operation of Russians against the Turks in the  Caucasus.]         \"The fall of Janik decided the fate of Van. On the night of       May 5 (18) the Turks evacuated Van, leaving twenty-six guns,       3,000 poods (a pood equals 36 pounds) of powder, their       treasure and documents; they went so silently that the       inhabitants did not know of it until the next morning.         \"On May 6 (19) the birthday of Czar Nicholas II., we entered       antique Van, the centre of the large and once wealthy       vilayet of the same name, amid extraordinary rejoicings, the       entire Christian population coming forth to meet us,       strewing flowers and green branches in the streets and       decking our soldiers with garlands.         \"The capture of Van is as important politically as it is       strategically. The advance on Mush and Bitlis is a necessary       consequence.\"          An \"Insult\" to War      Mount Kisco, N.Y., July 11, 1915.    _To the Editor of The New York Times:_    On Friday night at Carnegie Hall Miss Jane Addams stated that in the  present war, in order to get soldiers to charge with the bayonet, all  nations are forced first to make them drunk. I quote from THE TIMES  report:         In Germany they have a regular formula for it [she said]. In       England they use rum and the French resort to absinthe. In       other words, therefore, in the terrible bayonet charges they       speak of with dread, the men must be doped before they       start.    In this war the French or English soldier who has been killed in a  bayonet charge gave his life to protect his home and country. For his  supreme exit he had prepared himself by months of discipline. Through  the Winter in the trenches he has endured shells, disease, snow and  ice. For months he had been separated from his wife, children,  friends--all those he most loved. When the order to charge came it was  for them he gave his life, that against those who destroyed Belgium  they might preserve their home, might live to enjoy peace.    Miss Addams denies him the credit of his sacrifice. She strips him of  honor and courage. She tells his children, \"Your father"]]]
