There the acquisition of  temporal power, aggrandisement, and self-glorification mingled with the  grand object of the Prophet's previous life, and they were sought after  and attained by precisely the same instrumentality. Messages from Heaven  were freely brought forward to justify his political conduct, equally  with his religious precepts. Battles were fought, wholesale executions  inflicted, and territories annexed, under pretext of the Almighty's  sanction. Nay, even baser actions were not only excused, but encouraged  by the pretended divine approval or command. A special license was  produced, allowing Mahomet a double number of wives; the discreditable  affair of Mary the Coptic slave was justified in a separate Sura; and  the passion for the wife of his own adopted son and bosom friend was the  subject of an inspired message in which the Prophet's scruples were  rebuked by God; a divorce permitted, and marriage with the object of his  unhallowed desires enjoined.\"--Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, pp.  317-8.]    [Footnote 139: \"But the darker shades of character as well as the  brighter must be depicted by a faithful historian. Magnanimity or  moderation are nowhere discernible as features in the conduct of Mahomet  towards such of his enemies as failed to tender a timely allegiance.  Over the bodies of the Coreish who fell at Badr he exulted with savage  satisfaction; and several prisoners, accused of no crime but that of  scepticism and political opposition, were deliberately executed at his  command. The prince of Kheibar, after being subjected to inhuman torture  for the purpose of discovering the treasures of his tribe, was, with his  cousin, put to death on the pretext of having treacherously concealed  them; and his wife was led away captive to the tent of the conqueror.  Sentence of exile was enforced by Mahomet with rigorous severity on two  whole Jewish tribes at Medina; and of a third like his neighbours, the  women and children were sold into distant captivity, while the men  amounting to several hundreds were butchered in cold blood before his  eyes.    \"In his youth Mahomet earned among his fellows the honourable title of  'the Faithful.' But in later years, however much sincerity and good  faith may have guided his conduct in respect of his friends, craft and  deception were certainly not wanting towards his foes. The perfidious  attack at Nakhla, where the first blood in the internecine war with the  Coreish was shed, although at first disavowed by Mahomet, for its  scandalous breach of the sacred usages of Arabia, was eventually  justified by a pretended revelation. Abu Basir, the freebooter, was  countenanced by the Prophet in a manner scarcely consistent with the  letter, and certainly opposed to the spirit, of the truce of Hodeibia.  The surprise which secured the easy conquest of Mecca was designed with  craftiness, if not with duplicity. The pretext on which the Bani Nadhir  were besieged and expatriated (namely, that Gabriel had revealed their  design against the prophet's life), was feeble and unworthy of an honest  cause. When Medina was beleaguered by the confederate army, Mahomet  sought the services of Nueim, a traitor, and employed him to sow  distrust among the enemy by false and treacherous reports; 'for,' said  he, 'what else is war but a game at deception?' In his prophetical  career, political and personal ends were frequently compassed by the  flagrant pretence of _Divine_ revelations, which a candid examination  would have shewn him to be nothing more than the counterpart of his own  wishes. The Jewish and Christian systems, at first adopted honestly as  the basis of his own religion, had no sooner served the purpose of  establishing a firm authority, than they were ignored, if not disowned.  And what is perhaps worst of all, the dastardly assassination of  political and religious opponents, countenanced and frequently directed  as they were in all their cruel and perfidious details by Mahomet  himself leaves a dark and indelible blot upon his character.\"--Muir's  Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, pp. 307-9.    \"The reader will observe that simultaneously with the anxious desire to  extinguish idolatry, and to promote religion and virtue in the world,  there was nurtured by the Prophet in his own heart a licentious  self-indulgence; till in the end, assuming to be the favourite of  Heaven, he justified himself by 'revelations' from God in the most  flagrant breaches of morality. He will remark that while Mahomet  cherished a kind and tender disposition, 'weeping with them that wept,'  and binding to his person the hearts of his followers by the ready and  self-denying offices of love and friendship, he could yet take pleasure  in cruel and perfidious assassination, could gloat over the massacre of  an entire tribe, and savagely consign the innocent babe to the fires of  hell.\"--Muir's Life of Mahomet, Vol. IV, pp. 322-3.]    [Footnote 140: \"In domestic life the conduct of Mahomet with one grave  exception was exemplary. As a husband his fondness and devotion was  entire, bordering, however, at times upon jealousy. As a father he was  loving and tender. In his youth he is said to have lived a virtuous  life. At the age of twenty-five he married a widow forty years old; and  for five and twenty years he was a faithful husband to her alone. Yet it  is remarkable that during this period was composed most of those  passages of the Coran in which the black-eyed Houris, reserved for  believers in Paradise, are depicted in such glowing colours. Shortly  after the death of Khadija the Prophet married again; but it was not  till the mature age of fifty-four that he made the dangerous trial of  polygamy, by taking Ayesha, yet a child, as the rival of Sauda. Once the  natural limits of restraint were overpassed, Mahomet fell an easy prey  to his strong passion for the sex. In his fifty-sixth year he married  Haphsa; and the following year, in two succeeding months, Zeinab bint  Khozeima and Omm Salma. But his desires were not to be satisfied by the  range of a harem already greater than was permitted to any of his  followers; rather as age advanced, they were stimulated to seek for new  and varied indulgence. A few months after his nuptials with Zeinab and  Omm Salma, the charms of a second Zeinab were by accident discovered too  fully before the Prophet's admiring gaze. She was the wife of Zeid, his  adopted son and bosom friend; but he was unable to smother the flame she  kindled in his breast; and, by _divine_ command, she was taken to his  bed. In the same year he married a seventh wife, and also a concubine.  And at last, when he was full three score years of age, no fewer than  three new wives, besides Mary the Coptic slave, were within the space of  seven months added to his already well-filled harem.\"--Muir's Life of  Mahomet, Vol. IV, pp. 309-10.]    [Footnote 141: \"_Vide_ Muhammad and Muhammadanism, by Mr. R.

This is by no means giving  Mohammad conjugal allowances which he himself had proscribed as  unlawful. As a preliminary measure to abolish polygamy and to accustom  the people to monogamy, Mohammad, when reducing the unlimited polygamy  practised in Arabia, had put a strong condition to treat their wives,  when more than one, equitably in every sense of the word,--_i.e._, in  the matter of social comfort, love and household establishment (Sura IV,  3). When the measure had given a monogamous tendency to the Arab  society, it was declared that it was impossible practically to treat  equitably in all respects the contemporary wives (Sura IV, 128), and  those who had already contracted contemporaneous marriage before the  measure referred to above was introduced were absolved from the  condition laid down in Sura IV, 3, but were advised, regarding their  then existing wives, not to yield wholly to disinclination. Similarly  Mohammad was also relieved from that condition in Sura XXXIII, 51,  without \"giving him any conjugal allowance which he had himself  pronounced unlawful.\" The second instance is of Zeinab's case I suppose.  Zeinab was in no way, when divorced by Zeid, \"a woman forbidden to him  by his own laws.\"]    [Footnote 145: \"The Apostle becomes a creature so exalted that even the  easy drapery of Mohammadan morality becomes a garment too tight-fitting  for him.

CLOVER'S COLONIAL CHURCHES IN VIRGINIA.    ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, HAMPTON.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE,    BY REV. JOHN C. M'CABE,    WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM ORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY REV. LEWIS P. CLOVER         \"Regarded as a building what is there to engage our attention!       What is it which in this building inspires the veneration and       affection it commands? We have mused upon it when its gray       walls dully reflected the glory of the noontide sun. We have       looked upon it from a neighboring hill when bathed in the pure       light of a summer's moon, its lowly walls and tiny towers       seemed to stand only as the shell of a larger and wider       monument, amidst the memorials of the dead. Look upon it when       and where we will, we find our affections yearn towards it; and       we contemplate the little parish church with a delight and       reverence, that palaces cannot command. Whence then arises       this? It arises not from the beauties and ornaments of the       building, but _from the thoughts and recollections associated       with it_.\"--Molesworth.    [Illustration: ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.]      The region of country in lower Virginia, bordering, or near the James  River, from the head of tide water to the sea-board, is rich in the  possession of memorials of gone-by days, now turned up from the  bosom of the earth, in the shape of arrow-heads, and broken  war-hatchets--monuments, fragmentary monuments, of a race of forest-born  monarchs: now appealing to the antiquary in the mouldering records of  the County Court offices, and now, silently but eloquently, looking out  imploringly in the ruins of churches and tombs, which meet the eye of  the traveller, as he muses upon the faith and fortunes of generations  long departed.    Rapid as is the progress of steam upon those waters, which, in giving up  their Indian patronymies, gave up the bold hunter and his lithe canoe to  the progress of \"manifest destiny,\" few are those who pass the venerable  site of the first colony in Virginia, Jamestown, without paying a  tribute of a sigh, and perchance a tear, to that solitary tower which is  still standing a mute watcher amid the few almost illegible tombs,--all  that are left of a busy population long departed;--the germ, however, of  a great nation, whose name is even now \"a watchword to the earth.\"    The rank grass waves above those mouldering stones--the green corn of  summer rustles in the breeze, which seems, it its \"hollow, solemn  memnonian, but saintly swell,\" to have \"swept the field of mortality for  a hundred centuries,\"[C] and that lone, ruined, vine-crested tower,  stands, the only memorial of the house, and the Temple of God. Gone are  the altars where knelt the adventurer and the exile--high-born chivalry  and manly beauty--gentle blood and noble pedigree,--and where rose  \"humble voices,\" and beat \"pure hearts,\" approaching the throne of the  heavenly grace! Jamestown is a city of the dead, and precious is the  dust of its pathless cemetery!    When we turn \"from the wreck of the past that has perished,\" and stand  beside those monuments which have withstood the \"corroding tooth of  time,\" and still stand invested with the sacred and solemn beauty of  antiquity, we approach in the venerating spirit of worshippers, and  render our thank-offerings at their base. Such is likely to be the  feeling with the pilgrim antiquary, as he stands for the first time  beneath the shadows of that venerable cruciform pile, St. John's Church,  Hampton, which has braved \"the battle and the breeze\" of nearly two  centuries; and then, when he crosses its worn threshold, and treads its  echoing aisles, the wish must arise, involuntarily, to know something  of the history of a spot \"so sad, so fair.\"    With the exception of Jamestown, there is no portion of Virginia  possessing as much historic interest as Hampton, and its vicinity.  Hampton is the county seat of Elizabeth City County, which is one of the  eight original shires in which Virginia was divided. The town is  doubtless the oldest Indian settlement in Virginia, and it is a matter  of historical verity that it was the _first place_ visited by Captain  John Smith after he had cast anchor in these waters. We learn from  Burke, the historian, that while Smith and his company were \"engaged in  seeking a fit place for the first settlement, they met five of the  natives, who invited them to their town, _Kecoughtan_, or _Kichotan_,  where Hampton now stands. Here they were feasted with cakes made of  Indian corn, and regaled with tobacco and a dance. In return, they  presented the natives beads and other trinkets.\"    We have no occasion to go specially into the history of this expedition,  as it is well known to the student, that it was the result of a  successful application on the part of a company, succeeding that of the  ill-fated Sir Walter Raleigh, and for which a charter was obtained from  James the First, in the year 1606, for the settling of Virginia. \"The  design,\" says Stith, the historian of Virginia, \"included the  establishment of a northern and southern colony, and among the articles,  instructions, and orders,\" of the charter, provision was made for the  due carrying out of that which is the highest end of every Christian  colony, for it is expressly ordered, that \"the said president, council,  and ministers, should provide that the true word and service of God be  preached, planted, and used, according to the rites and doctrines of the  Church of England; not only in the said colonies, but also as much as  might be amongst the savages bordering upon them, and that all persons  should kindly treat the savages, and heathen people, in those parts, and  use all proper means to draw them to the true service and knowledge of  God.\"[D] This expedition left the shores of England, December 19, 1606,  and, after a protracted voyage, occasioned by unpropitious winds, which  kept them in sight of home for more than \"six weeks,\" reached the capes  of Virginia. The southern cape was christened \"Henry,\" and the northern,  \"Charles,\" after the King's sons. This was on the 26th day of April,  1607. Accompanying this expedition was Rev. Robert Hunt, of the English  Church, as the first chaplain of that colony, which, though few as the  grains of mustard seed scattered by the morning wind, was the first  planting of that tree which was destined, in coming time, to strike its  roots deep down into the centre of empire, and to shelter beneath its  strong branches, and wide-spread shadows, the exile and the oppressed,  and to furnish home and altar for the pilgrim of civil and religious  freedom.    When we look around now and behold our country, \"the observed of all  observers,\" exalting her \"towering head,\" and \"lifting her eyes,\" the  mind instinctively turns to the colony of Jamestown; and we cannot but  exclaim, in the words of the Psalmist, \"Thou hast brought a vine out of  Egypt; Thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it. Thou preparedst  room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root; and it filled the  land. The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs  thereof were like the goodly cedars. She sent out her boughs unto the  sea, and her branches unto the river.\" But a sad memory for the days of  toil, and struggle, and blood in that little colony, will remind us that  this tree was not \"transplanted from Paradise with all its branches in  full fruitage.\" Neither was it \"sowed in sunshine,\" nor was it \"in  vernal breezes and gentle rains that it fixed its roots, and grew and  strengthened.\" Oh, no! oh, no! In the mournfully beautiful words of  Coleridge, \"With blood was it planted; it was rocked in tempests; the  goat, the ass, and the stag gnawed it, the wild boar whetted its tusk  upon its bark; the deep scars are still extant on its trunk, and the  path of the lightning may be traced among its higher branches!\" The  first communion of the body and blood of our Lord was administered by  the pious Hunt, May 4, 1607, the day after the debarkation of the  colonists: and, \"here,\" says the Bishop of Oxford, \"on a peninsula, upon  the northern shore of James River, was sown the first seed of  Englishmen, who, in after years, were to grow and to multiply into the  great and numerous American people.\" It was an offering, this first  sacrament, of the \"appointed sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving;\" and  we have an evidence of the pervading spirit of Hunt in that little band,  when we remember that among their very first acts after rearing their  straw-thatched houses for protection from the weather, was to erect the  church of the colony. Hunt was succeeded, after his death, in 1610, by  Master Bucke (the chaplain of Lord de la Ware), whose services were  called forth the very day of his arrival at Jamestown. According to  Purchas, \"He (that is Lord Delaware) cast anchor before Jamestown, where  we landed, and our much grieved Governor, first visiting the church,  caused the bell to be rung; at which all such as were able to come forth  of their house, repayered to church, which was neatly trimmed with the  wild flowers of the country, where our minister, Master Bucke, made a  zealous and sorrowful prayer, finding all things so contrary to our  expectations, and full of misery and misgovernment.\" This state of  things had been brought about by the treacherous conduct of their  neighbors, the savages, domestic feuds, fluctuations in the quantity and  quality of their food, bad water, and severe climatic diseases. While  \"Master Bucke\" was toiling with the little band at Jamestown,"]]]
