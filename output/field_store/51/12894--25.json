But just because it is the play of his own  imagination, the most essential factor certainly is the will and  expectation of the subject. No one can really be hypnotized against his  own will. And to expect strong hypnotic effect from a certain hypnotist  is often in itself sufficient to produce hypnotic sleep. Thus there is  no special personal power necessary to produce hypnotism. Everybody can  hypnotize. And almost with the same sweeping statement it may be said  everybody can be hypnotized, provided that he is willing to enter into  this play of imagination. The young child or the insane person is  therefore unfit.    Of course, not everybody can be hypnotized to the same degree. Just as  the normal suggestibility showed itself very different with different  persons, the degree of artificial reenforcement varies still more.  Practically everybody can be brought to that breakdown of the  resistance in which he can no longer open the eyes against the order of  the hypnotist, but rather few can be brought to the point of seeing  extended hallucinations, or accepting the disappearance of persons who  are speaking, or of yielding to the impulse to a dangerous action. The  highest reported degree, in which even criminal actions are performed  by honest men, exists in my opinion only in the imagination of  amateurs; it is certainly not difficult to produce sham crimes for  performance sake, with paper daggers and toy pistols, but that is no  proof at all that the hypnotized person would commit a crime under  conditions under which he has the conviction that he faces a real  criminal situation. But if we abstract from real crime, we certainly  have to acknowledge that actions can be performed which appear in  striking contrast with the habits and character of the normal  personality, upset his knowledge, and are based on beliefs which would  be immediately rejected under ordinary conditions. These higher degrees  of hypnotic state are easily followed by complete loss of memory for all  that happened during the abnormal state.    How have we to interpret such a surprising alteration of mind? It lies  near to compare it with sleep. The brain seems powerless to produce its  normal ideas, the associations do not arise, the normal impulses have  disappeared and a general ineffectiveness has set in; in short, the  brain cells seem unable to function. Of course, the explanation of sleep  itself may offer difficulties. Is it a chemical substance which poisons  the brain during the sleep, or are the brain cells contracted so that  the excitement cannot run over from the branches of one nerve cell into  those of another? Or are the blood-vessels contracted so that an anaemic  state makes their normal function impossible? But whatever the physical  condition of sleep may be, have we really a right to emphasize the  similarity between sleep and hypnosis? After all that we have discussed,  we ought rather to recognize that the hypnotic state too comes much  nearer to the process of attention than to the process of sleep. We saw  that in every act of attention the process of inhibition is essential.  All that is not in harmony with the attended idea is suppressed. Yet we  should hesitate to say that in attention parts of our brain are asleep.    We should feel reluctance to group such inhibition together with sleep  because it would be a sleep which at any moment can pass from one part  of the brain to others and which certainly leaves at every moment most  of the cell groups unaffected. We saw that attention does not at all  focus on one narrow point, but that an abundance of impressions, of  ideas and associations, of thoughts and emotions can enter the field of  attention, if they all lead to one and the same motor attitude, and that  only the one part is inhibited which involves the opposite action. Such  a jumping sleep which at every moment selects a special part would be,  of course, just the contrary of that which characterizes the sleep state  of the fatigued brain. But exactly these characteristics of attention  belong to hypnotism too. It is not true that the mind of the hypnotized  is asleep and that perhaps only one or the other idea can be pushed into  his mind. On the contrary, his mind is open to an abundance of ideas,  just as in the normal state. If I tell him that this is a landscape in  Switzerland, he sees at once the mountains and the lakes, and his mind  provides all the details of his reminiscences, and his imagination  furnishes plenty of additions. His whole mind is awake; the feelings and  emotions and volitions, the memories and judgments and thoughts are  rushing on, and only that is excluded which demands a contrary attitude.  This selective process stands decidedly in the center of the hypnotic  experience and makes it very doubtful whether we are psychophysically on  the right track, if we make much of the slight similarity between  hypnosis and sleep.    This has nothing to do with the fact that hypnosis is best brought about  by suggesting the idea of sleep, that is, the belief that sleep will  set in. This belief is indeed effective in removing all the ideas  which are awake in the mind which would interfere with the willingness  to submit to the suggestions of the hypnotizer. But the fact that  belief in sleep and expectation of sleep bring with them the hypnotic  state is not a proof that the hypnotic state itself is sleep. Even  the mental experiences which can remain in sleep, the dreams, are  characteristically different from the hypnotic experience. Thus the  dreams show that unselective awakening of ideas which is to be expected  from a general decrease of functioning. The hypnotic variation is  characterized just by its selective narrowing of consciousness. For the  same reason, hypnotism is strikingly different from such diseases of the  mind as dementia. Certainly in dementia too, many associations are cut  off, but it is not a selective inhibition, it is a haphazard destruction  resulting from the degeneration in the brain.    The fundamental principle of the hypnotic state lies in its selective  character. Inhibited and cut off are those states which are antagonistic  to the beliefs in the suggested ideas, and as their antagonism consists  in their connection with opposite actions, the whole is again a question  of motor setting. No doubt, such new motor setting can precede the  normal sleep too; thus the sleeper may be insensitive to any surrounding  noises, but perhaps awake at the slightest call from a patient who is  intrusted to his care. In that case, one special feature of hypnotism is  superadded to sleep but the sleep itself is not hypnotic. Again sleep  may go over into a state which shares many characteristic features with  hypnotism, that is, somnambulism, and it may be said with a certain  truth that hypnotism is artificial somnambulism. But somnambulism, while  arising in sleep, is not at all a feature of sleep.    While sleep is characterized by a decrease of sensitiveness and of  selective powers, the selective process of hypnotism rather reenforces  sensitiveness and memory in every field which is covered by the  suggestive influence. Stimuli may become noticeable which the normal man  is unable to perceive, and long-forgotten experiences which seem  inaccessible to the search of the waking mind may reproduce themselves  and may vividly enter consciousness. Again we have there symptoms which  rather characterize the state of over-attention than the state of sleep.  We might add further that we know states with all the characteristics of  hypnotism in which even the subjective idea of sleep is entirely  absent, for instance, all those which are usually called states of  fascination. A certain shining light or a glimpse of an uncanny eye may  startle and upset the imagination of the subject and throw him into a  state of abnormally increased suggestibility. It is well known that  whole epidemics of such captivation have occurred and have resulted in  hysterias of the masses in which the subjects become the slaves of their  impulse, perhaps to imitate what they see or hear, or to realize ideas  in which they believe without logical warrant. They surely are not  asleep, are not even partially asleep. Every center of their brains  would be ready to work, if the captivated attention were not forcing the  mind in one direction and selectively suppressing every impulse to  opposite actions. The developed hypnotism finally shades off into  innumerable states of hypnoid character in which the sleeplike symptoms  are entirely in the background.    Thus the increased suggestibility of the hypnotic state will result not  from a partial sleeplike decrease of functioning but the decrease of  function is a motor inhibition which results from over-attention. In the  ordinary attention, our motor setting secures only an increase in  clearness and vividness of the attended ideas, but in an abnormal  over-attention the new motor setting produces a complete acceptance with  all its consequences. Abnormal or heightened attention thus goes  directly over into the belief and into the impulse without resistance.  There is no hypnotism which does not contain from the first stage this  definite relation to certain objects of attention, usually to a  particular person. All the manipulations, passes, fixation, monotonous  speaking, and so on narrow the contents of consciousness but hold the  idea of the hypnotizing person steadily in the center of attention. The  awakened expectation of sleep, the associated feeling of tiredness all  help to cut off attention from the remainder of the world, but as no  real sleep sets in, this cutting off from the remainder reenforces the  focusing of attention on the one central idea of the hypnotizing  personality. Every word and every movement of this personality become  therefore absorbed with that over-attention which leads at once from a  mere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22776"],[0,"From a Terrace in Prague (#19)"],[1,"in Asia, probably  from the region of Lake Baikal. They swept over Russia, swamping the  domains of the disunited princes of that country, defeated Poles and  Silesians at Liegnitz, and generally set up a healthy scare in  disordered Europe. Wenceslaus rose to the occasion like a good stout  P[vr]emysl. He fortified the passes leading into Bohemia from Silesia,  and there his sturdy soldiery defeated the Tartars, who turned off  towards Moravia, Hungary and Austria, and vanished again from Europe as  quickly as they had come. Thereupon Pope and Emperor, Bohemian King and  Austrian Duke, and all the smaller fry, resumed their fighting of each  other, launching bulls and banns and such-like amenities into space on  the chance of some one or other being affected thereby. The Bohemian  nobility thought fit to add to the gaiety of nations by starting an  insurrection against Wenceslaus, a movement led, according to  time-honoured custom, by the King's son Ottokar, who had been entrusted  with the government of Moravia. This Ottokar eventually ascended the  throne of Bohemia as second King of that name, and became one of the  most notable rulers of his time and race.    The early days of Ottokar II are noteworthy on account of the close  connection established between Bohemia and Austria which led to endless  complications and eventual disaster for the former country. Ottokar  thought fit to marry Adela, sister of Duke Frederick of Austria,  Frederick the Warlike, the last of the long line of Babenberg. The lady  was forty-six, Ottokar twenty-five, but that does not matter when there  is a chance of inheriting something. Ottokar was elected Duke by the  Estates of Austria, and endeavoured to incorporate Styria into his  dominions. In this he met with opposition from Bela, King of Hungary,  with whom he came to an agreement after the usual fighting. Thereupon  Ottokar turned his attention to the heathen Prussians, who were supposed  to be getting ripe for conversion to Christianity. He defeated them in  several battles, which made his task much easier, and founded a strong  city, named Koenigsberg after him, to keep the Prussians from  back-sliding.    It is interesting to note that Ottokar's policy brought him into a  certain degree of contact with England. The Holy Roman Empire was making  very heavy weather at the time, the German Electors being thoroughly at  variance amongst themselves, and so it came about that after a period of  intense anarchy euphemistically called the \"Interregnum,\" two rivals  were put up of whom neither could be said to have occupied the throne.  These rivals were both foreigners to Germany, one being a Spaniard, the  other Richard of Cornwall, second son of King John of England. Ottokar  thought fit to support Richard, who in return did little things to  oblige Ottokar, such as investing him with other people's lands and  fiefs, and all went well for a while. Ottokar had extended his dominions  considerably, had brought a number of smaller States, some of them  German, under his sway and virtually controlled all Central Europe from  the Baltic to the Adriatic Seas. He had beaten the Hungarian King Bela  and his friends, Daniel Romanovic the King of Russia and Prince of Kiev,  a Prince of Cracow and odd assortments of Serbs, Bulgars, and  Wallachians, most handsomely at Kressenbrunn on the plains of the River  March.    Ottokar's political conception of the part which Bohemia should play in  Central Europe is particularly interesting. By conquest, alliances and  understandings with his neighbours he had acquired a preponderating  influence in the councils of Europe. The power he had concentrated round  the Slavonic nucleus of his native country lay almost entirely in  German-speaking districts, so that a situation arose in which Count  Luetzov finds some analogy between the policy of this P[vr]emysl Ottokar  and that pursued by the Austrian Government from 1815, when the  Habsburgs finally abandoned the notion of a Holy Roman Empire, to 1864  and 1866, when Prussia took the first decisive step towards reviving the  same idea under the title _Deutsches Reich_. There is a good deal in  Count Luetzov's contention, and this subject might well be taken up by  some leisured student of history. It seems to me that the history of  Central Europe shows several instances of attempted breaks from  tradition and striving after a more lasting political re-grouping such  as Ottokar seemed to have aimed at; I hope to return to this subject  later, though I may only touch the fringe of it.    Ottokar's plans were completely upset, first by the death of his  obliging friend Richard of Cornwall, next by events attending and  arising out of the choice of a new Emperor by the German Electors.  Ottokar being a Slav, and a very powerful one at that, was heartily  hated by all German Princes, so they, being in a majority, disallowed  Ottokar's right to vote at all, and elected as Emperor one Rudolph  Count of Habsburg. History of this time was recorded by Germans chiefly,  and they have spared no trouble to blacken Ottokar's character, by which  process Rudolph of Habsburg is made to stand out as a light shining in  the darkness. In Germanic eyes Ottokar's fault was that of being a Slav,  successful and of great ability. I cannot agree with the German  chronicler's estimate of Rudolph. We are expected to accept him as a  modest sort of backwoods peer, the kind that wears flannel next its skin  and keeps its small estates unencumbered. We have also a pretty picture  in verse of this Rudolph. He is described as meeting a priest carrying  the Host, on the bank of a foaming mountain torrent somewhere among the  Alps where the ruins of the Habsburg still show against the sky like an  abandoned hawk's nest; the name probably derives from Habichts Burg,  Hawk's Castle. Rudolph dismounted, placed the priest on his horse and  humbly, cap in hand, led it across the stream. Years after this  picturesque event the priest, carefully disguised, attended the Council  of Electors and at the psychological moment, produced his harp, burst  into song on the subject of Rudolph, and so swayed the Electors that  they offered the German crown to that modest and retiring Habsburg. I  cannot believe this story of the priest among the Electors, and my  disbelief is based on experience of elective bodies. Can you imagine the  Parish Council, in the throes of electing a suitable person to keep the  village pump in order, being confronted by a mysterious stranger who  suddenly interrupts the proceedings by singing the praises of \"good old  Jarge\" to the accompaniment of an accordion? No, there is something  wrong about that election story; I believe Rudolph was a schemer, and  the whole affair cut and dried before he stood for election at all.  Certain it is that Rudolph, supported by all Germany, attacked Ottokar;  this was the first rencontre between Bohemia and the House of Habsburg,  and it ended in disaster for the former. Ottokar was deprived of all the  lands he had acquired, betrayed by his own nobles, and finally killed  in battle near the scene of his victory over the Hungarians.    Despite the troublous times of the two Ottokars and of Wenceslaus I, the  city of Prague, or rather the communities composing it, had expanded  into a place of considerable extent and importance, and was already  spoken of as the City of many Towers. The three above-mentioned  sovereigns, as also Wenceslaus II, son and successor of Ottokar II, had  found time and means to do a considerable amount of building of which  some traces are still evident. We have already noted that Wenceslaus I  girt the Old Town around with walls, likewise the hill of Vy[vs]ehrad,  and he took the strengthening of the Hrad[vs]any in hand. This latter  job was completed for the time being by Ottokar II, who caused those  imposing-looking towers on the north front of the castle to be built.  These towers are named respectively Black Tower, White Tower, and  Daliborka, by which latter hangs a tale which I will relate to you by  and by. Some of the authorities I have consulted differ as to the actual  date of these towers, and are inclined to place the building of  Daliborka in the fourteenth century, probably into the period when  Charles IV found the royal castle to be badly in need of repair and set  about the work forthwith. It is certain, however, that both the  Wenceslaus and Ottokars interested themselves in strengthening the  fortifications of Prague, and are not likely to have neglected the  Hrad[vs]any, which stronghold was furnished with a permanent garrison of  ten knights and three hundred men-at-arms. The north side of the castle  has preserved the mediaeval appearance which has been improved away on  the other sides, chiefly by fatuous Habsburger in the seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries; the north side overhanging the deep-cut Stags'  Moat shows you the formidable nature of this fortress with its stout  towers rising up over the tops of tall trees that struggle up out of the  valley mentioned by Libu[vs]a, for a glimpse of the sun.    The towers of the Hrad[vs]any were suitably fitted out as dungeons, with  the latest thing in trap-doors warranted to give the visitor a sudden  and complete change of air. One of these towers soon found a lodger, one  Dalibor after whom the tower was named for ever after. There is an opera  all about Dalibor composed by Smetana; the music is very beautiful, but  as the singing is all in Czech, I have not quite got the hang of the  story, so will give as nearly as I can and by the aid of my own  imagination, what happened to Dalibor.    Dalibor, it appears, was a Bohemian knight with views in advance of his  time: he was a socialist. One day he assembled his friends, relatives  and retainers in the castle yard and appeared among them armed and on  horseback. He dismounted and commenced proceedings by scraping off his "]]]
