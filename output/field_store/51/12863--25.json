But a week later the two nearly upset the Hattie S. in a wild attempt  to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick. The grim brute  rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish, and between the three  of them it was a mercy they all got off alive.    At last, after playing blindman's-buff in the fog, there came a morning  when Disko shouted down the fo'c'sle: \"Hurry, boys! We're in taown!\"        CHAPTER VIII    To the end of his days, Harvey will never forget that sight. The sun  was just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week, and  his low red light struck into the riding-sails of three fleets of  anchored schooners--one to the north, one to the westward, and one to  the south. There must have been nearly a hundred of them, of every  possible make and build, with, far away, a square-rigged Frenchman, all  bowing and courtesying one to the other. From every boat dories were  dropping away like bees from a crowded hive; and the clamour of voices,  the rattling of ropes and blocks, and the splash of the oars carried  for miles across the heaving water. The sails turned all colours,  black, pearly-grey, and white, as the sun mounted; and more boats swung  up through the mists to the southward.    The dories gathered in clusters, separated, reformed, and broke again,  all heading one way; while men hailed and whistled and cat-called and  sang, and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard.    \"It's a town,\" said Harvey. \"Disko was right. It is a town!\"    \"I've seen smaller,\" said Disko. \"There's about a thousand men here;  an' yonder's the Virgin.\" He pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea,  where there were no dories.    The \"We're Here\" skirted round the northern squadron, Disko waving his  hand to friend after friend, and anchored as neatly as a racing yacht  at the end of the season. The Bank fleet pass good seamanship in  silence; but a bungler is jeered all along the line.    \"Jest in time fer the caplin,\" cried the Mary Chilton.    \"'Salt 'most wet?\" asked the King Philip.    \"Hey, Tom Platt! Come t' supper to-night?\" said the Henry Clay; and so  questions and answers flew back and forth. Men had met one another  before, dory-fishing in the fog, and there is no place for gossip like  the Bank fleet. They all seemed to know about Harvey's rescue, and  asked if he were worth his salt yet. The young bloods jested with Dan,  who had a lively tongue of his own, and inquired after their health by  the town--nicknames they least liked. Manuel's countrymen jabbered at  him in their own language; and even the silent cook was seen riding the  jib-boom and shouting Gaelic to a friend as black as himself. After  they had buoyed the cable--all around the Virgin is rocky bottom, and  carelessness means chafed ground-tackle and danger from drifting--after  they had buoyed the cable, their dories went forth to join the mob of  boats anchored about a mile away. The schooners rocked and dipped at a  safe distance, like mother ducks watching their brood, while the dories  behaved like mannerless ducklings.    As they drove into the confusion, boat banging boat, Harvey's ears  tingled at the comments on his rowing. Every dialect from Labrador to  Long Island, with Portuguese, Neapolitan, Lingua Franca, French, and  Gaelic, with songs and shoutings and new oaths, rattled round him, and  he seemed to be the butt of it all. For the first time in his life he  felt shy--perhaps that came from living so long with only the \"We're  Heres\"--among the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the  reeling small craft. A gentle, breathing swell, three furlongs from  trough to barrel, would quietly shoulder up a string of variously  painted dories. They hung for an instant, a wonderful frieze against  the sky-line, and their men pointed and hailed, Next moment the open  mouths, waving arms, and bare chests disappeared, while on another  swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in  a toy theatre. So Harvey stared. \"Watch out!\" said Dan, flourishing a  dip-net. \"When I tell you dip, you dip. The caplin'll school any time  from naow on. Where'll we lay, Tom Platt?\"    Pushing, shoving, and hauling, greeting old friends here and warning  old enemies there, Commodore Tom Platt led his little fleet well to  leeward of the general crowd, and immediately three or four men began  to haul on their anchors with intent to lee-bow the \"We're Heres\". But  a yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with  exceeding speed, its occupant pulling madly on the roding.    \"Give her slack!\" roared twenty voices. \"Let him shake it out.\"    \"What's the matter?\" said Harvey, as the boat flashed away to the  southward. \"He's anchored, isn't he?\"    \"Anchored, sure enough, but his graound-tackle's kinder shifty,\" said  Dan, laughing. \"Whale's fouled it. . . . Dip, Harve! Here they come!\"    The sea round them clouded and darkened, and then frizzed up in showers  of tiny silver fish, and over a space of five or six acres the cod  began to leap like trout in May; while behind the cod three or four  broad grey-black backs broke the water into boils.    Then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the  school, and fouled his neighbour's line and said what was in his heart,  and dipped furiously with his dip-net, and shrieked cautions and advice  to his companions, while the deep fizzed like freshly opened  soda-water, and cod, men, and whales together flung in upon the  luckless bait. Harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of  Dan's net. But in all the wild tumult he noticed, and never forgot, the  wicked, set little eye--something like a circus elephant's eye--of a  whale that drove along almost level with the water, and, so he said,  winked at him. Three boats found their rodings fouled by these reckless  mid-sea hunters, and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the  line free.    Then the caplin moved off and five minutes later there was no sound  except the splash of the sinkers overside, the flapping of the cod, and  the whack of the muckles as the men stunned them. It was wonderful  fishing. Harvey could see the glimmering cod below, swimming slowly in  droves, biting as steadily as they swam. Bank law strictly forbids more  than one hook on one line when the dories are on the Virgin or the  Eastern Shoals; but so close lay the boats that even single hooks  snarled, and Harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle, hairy  Newfoundlander on one side and a howling Portuguese on the other.    Worse than any tangle of fishing-lines was the confusion of the  dory-rodings below water. Each man had anchored where it seemed good to  him, drifting and rowing round his fixed point. As the fish struck on  less quickly, each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground; but  every third man found himself intimately connected with some four or  five neighbours. To cut another's roding is crime unspeakable on the  Banks; yet it was done, and done without detection, three or four times  that day. Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and knocked him  over the gunwale with an oar, and Manuel served a fellow-countryman in  the same way. But Harvey's anchor-line was cut, and so was Penn's, and  they were turned into relief-boats to carry fish to the \"We're Here\" as  the dories filled. The caplin schooled once more at twilight, when the  mad clamour was repeated; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by  the light of kerosene-lamps on the edge of the pen.    It was a huge pile, and they went to sleep while they were dressing.  Next day several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin; and  Harvey, with them, looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock,  which rises to within twenty feet of the surface. The cod were there in  legions, marching solemnly over the leathery kelp. When they bit, they  bit all together; and so when they stopped. There was a slack time at  noon, and the dories began to search for amusement. It was Dan who  sighted the Hope of Prague just coming up, and as her boats joined the  company they were greeted with the question: \"Who's the meanest man in  the Fleet?\"    Three hundred voices answered cheerily:    \"Nick Bra-ady.\" It sounded an organ chant.    \"Who stole the lamp-wicks?\" That was Dan's contribution.    \"Nick Bra-ady,\" sang the boats.    \"Who biled the salt bait fer soup?\" This was an unknown backbiter a  quarter of a mile away.    Again the joyful chorus. Now, Brady was not especially mean, but he had  that reputation, and the Fleet made the most of it. Then they  discovered a man from a Truro boat who, six years before, had been  convicted of using a tackle with five or six hooks--a \"scrowger,\" they  call it--on the Shoals. Naturally, he had been christened \"Scrowger Jim\";  and though he had hidden himself on the Georges ever since, he found  his honours waiting for him full blown. They took it up in a sort of  fire-cracker chorus: \"Jim! O Jim! Jim! O Jim! Sssscrowger Jim!\" That  pleased everybody. And when a poetical Beverly man--he had been making  it up all day, and talked about it for weeks--sang, \"The Carrie  Pitman's anchor doesn't hold her for a cent!\" the dories felt that they  were indeed fortunate. Then they had to ask that Beverly man how he was  off for beans, because even poets must not have things all their own  way. Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn. Was there a  careless or dirty cook anywhere? The dories sang about him and his  food. Was a schooner badly found? The Fleet was told at full length.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#19)"],[1," and the  Peace Conference was broken up and the war resumed.    In this second phase of the Balkan war against Turkey (1914), the  efforts of the Balkan League were practically confined to attacks upon  the fortresses still held by the Turks in the conquered territories.  Scutari, Janina, Adrianople fell after fierce battles. The revolution  clearly had done nothing to restore the military strength of the Turks.  Now another effort was made to end the war, and the Peace Conference  resumed its sessions in London.    Whilst during the 1913 session all the delay had been caused by Turkey,  now Turkey shared the willingness of Bulgaria to sign a peace on terms  dictated by the Powers, which left to Turkey the territory behind the  Midia-Rodosto line, and reserved for a European decision the fate of the  Aegean Islands and the boundaries of an independent state of Albania  which was to be set up. But both Servia and Greece were reluctant now to  assent to such peace conditions. Both felt a grievance about the  creation of an independent Albania which deprived them of a great  stretch of territory on the Adriatic which they had hoped to share. Both  felt that yet another war was necessary to settle issues as to the  division of the spoil with Bulgaria.    To the delays for which Servia and Greece were responsible there was an  added complication arising from the attitude of Roumania. That  kingdom--which had taken no active part in the late war, but which had  secretly nursed a boundary grievance against Bulgaria dating back from  the War of Liberation, when Russia robbed Roumania of Bessarabia and  proposed to pay her with Bulgarian territory without actually doing  so--now announced that she must be a party to any new Balkan settlement,  and mobilised her forces to give accent to the demand she had been  making for some time for a territorial concession from Bulgaria.    The diplomacy of Bulgaria under these difficult circumstances was  deplorable. Her statesmen seemed bemused with the intoxication of  Bulgarian military victories, and unable to forget the glowing  calculations of the future Bulgarian Empire which they had made during  the course of the war. Those calculations I gathered from gossip with  all classes in Bulgaria at different times, speaking not only with  politicians but with bankers, trading people, and others. They concluded  that the Turk was going to be driven out of Europe, at any rate, as far  as Constantinople. They considered that Constantinople was too great a  prize for the Bulgarian nation or for the Balkan States, and that  Constantinople would be left as an international city to be governed by  a commission of the Great Powers. Bulgaria was, then, to have of what  had been Turkey-in-Europe, the province of Thrace, and a large part of  Macedonia as far as the city of Salonica.    [Illustration: A YOUNG GIRL OF IRN]    Salonica was desired very much by the Bulgarians, and also very much by  the Greeks; and the decision in regard to Salonica before the war was  that it would be best to make it a free Balkan city, governed by all the  Balkan States in common, as a free port for all the Balkan States. The  frontier of Greece was to extend to the north, and Greece was to be  allowed all the Aegean Islands. The Servian frontier was to extend to  the eastward and the southward, and what is now the autonomous province  of Albania (the creation of which was insisted on by the Powers) was to  be divided between Montenegro and Servia.    That division would have left the Bulgarians with the greatest spoil of  the war. They would have had entry on to the Sea of Marmora; they would  have controlled, perhaps, one side of the Dardanelles (but I believe  they thought that the Dardanelles might also be left to a commission of  the Powers). Now, with the clash of diplomacy, it was sternly necessary  to curtail that ambition considerably, and to decide to seek a friend  among the different rivals. Bulgarian diplomats could not be made to  see that. They were firm with Turkey: wisely enough, for Turkey had no  power left to wound or to help. But at the same time they refused to  make any concessions either to Servia, to Greece, or to Roumania, all of  whom were determined to have a share of the plunder which Bulgaria had  assigned for herself. \"A leonine partnership\" as the lawyers call it,  that is to say, a partnership in which one party takes the lion's share  of the spoil, is a very satisfactory arrangement for the lion. But one  wants to be sure before attempting to enforce leonine arrangements that  one is the lion. Bulgaria blundered on into a position which left her  exhausted army to face at once Greece, Servia, Montenegro, and Roumania.    That it was not necessary for her to get into that position I can say  with some confidence. A more judicious handling of her relations with  Servia would have kept the friendship of that kindred nation, and  Montenegro would have followed Servia. The united Slav peoples of the  Balkans would then have been strong enough to withstand any attempt to  enforce unfair conditions by Roumania or Greece. But Bulgaria made no  attempt to conciliate Servia. Between the two peoples there had existed  before the war a very close treaty of alliance. This treaty had arranged  for the division of the spoil of the war on a basis which had not  foreseen that the European Powers would create an independent Albania;  and Servia had not imagined that Turkey would be so weak, and that the  booty in Thrace would have been so considerable. Bulgaria thus had more  than was expected in one quarter, whilst Servia was bitterly  disappointed in another direction. Friends, under the circumstances,  would have struck another bargain. Bulgaria insisted upon the strict  letter of the old bargain.    Servia was thus forced into the arms of Greece; reluctantly, I think. If  she could have made a fair arrangement with Bulgaria she would have  preferred that. But it seemed to be destined that Bulgaria should add  another to the long list of her frustrated hopes.    The early part of 1914 saw the Balkans in the throes of a war which  eclipsed in bitterness and bloodshed the campaign of 1913. Greece and  Servia fought against Bulgaria, and Roumania marched down from the north  towards the Bulgarian capital, her army unopposed because there was no  means of opposing it. Stopping short of entering Sofia, Roumania took  up the position of the chief Power in the Balkans and insisted upon  dictating terms of peace. Those terms Bulgaria, perforce, accepted after  her army had been defeated with terrible slaughter by the Servian and  Grecian forces. She was forced to give up territory in all directions:  to Roumania on the north; to Servia on the west; to Greece on the south.  To crown her misfortunes, the Turks moved up against the prostrate  country, recaptured, without an effort, Adrianople, which had been won  with such terrible cost of Bulgarian blood, and also Kirk Kilisse. In  the final result Bulgaria was left with but little net gain as the price  of her enormous sacrifices of blood and of treasure. To the north she  actually lost some of her old territory. From the Turk she secured a  fragment of Thrace, and a part of Macedonia which gave her access to the  Aegean Sea, but no decent port there, and no possibility of carrying out  her grandiose scheme of canalising the River Maritza and making a  Bulgarian Adrianople a port for trade. Further, she had the  mortification of seeing all three of her rivals in the Balkans  aggrandised, and Roumania left with the hegemony of the Peninsula.    Only a few months before, Mr. Noel Buxton had written the \"Io triumphe\"  of the Bulgarian cause:        The blight that had lain on the Balkan lands was healed, the fog      dispelled. Even the prestige of military despotism was gone like      a pricked bubble. The tyranny that rested on delusion and not on      power was vanished like an empty nightmare that fades when the      sleeper wakes. The establishment of Europe's freedom was      fulfilled; the final step taken. A great and notable nation had      obtained recognition through the war. Its persistence, its      purpose, its deep reserve, now stood revealed, added to the      world's stores of national character.        For centuries the Bulgarian refused to compromise with the Turk.      Other nations sought to lighten the weight of the yoke by taking      service with the tyrant or bowing the head. The maxim, \"The      sword never strikes when the head is bowed,\" undermined the soul      of other nations, never of this. Influence and wealth went to      others; all seemed lost by the policy of defiance. Bulgarians      would not balance advantages. A kind of faith made them ready to      pay even death for ultimate gain. The spirit wins at last: and      the indomitable spirit of the Bulgars has come by its just      reward.    Three months after that the Turk was back in Thrace, and the national  life of Bulgaria had touched its lowest point since the war of  Liberation, with only her justified hope in the future as a consolation.          CHAPTER X    SOME FACTS FOR THE TOURIST AND THE ECONOMIST      Bulgaria is in the main tableau or plain land sheltered by lofty  mountains. On the north it is bounded by the Danube until the town of  Silistra is reached, when an artificial frontier cuts down from the  river to the Black Sea coast. By the cession of territory to Roumania in  1914 this artificial frontier took a more southerly course, and reaches  now to a point just north of Varna. The coast of the Black Sea bounds  Bulgaria on the east, and she has there two ports, Varna and Burgas. On  the south the frontier is now European Turkey as far west almost as the  24th parallel of latitude, and then the bordering territory is Greece.  On the west the boundary is Servia. The Balkan Mountains and the Rhodope  Mountains run roughly east and west: the"]]]
