He had scarcely entered it when in a chair  by the door he perceived Ann Chester, and at the sight of her all  his depression vanished and he was himself again.    \"Why, how do you do, Mr. Bayliss? Are you lunching here?\"    \"Unless there is some other place that you would prefer,\" said  Jimmy. \"I hope I haven't kept you waiting.\"    Ann laughed. She was looking very delightful in something soft  and green.    \"I'm not going to lunch with you. I'm waiting for Mr. Ralstone  and his sister. Do you remember him? He crossed over with us. His  chair was next to mine on the promenade deck.\"    Jimmy was shocked. When he thought how narrowly she had escaped,  poor girl, from lunching with that insufferable pill Teddy--or  was it Edgar?--he felt quite weak. Recovering himself, he spoke  firmly.    \"When were they to have met you?\"    \"At one o'clock.\"    \"It is now five past. You are certainly not going to wait any  longer. Come with me, and we will whistle for cabs.\"    \"Don't be absurd!\"    \"Come along. I want to talk to you about my future.\"    \"I shall certainly do nothing of the kind,\" said Ann, rising. She  went with him to the door. \"Teddy would never forgive me.\" She  got into the cab. \"It's only because you have appealed to me to  help you discuss your future,\" she said, as they drove off.  \"Nothing else would have induced me . . .\"    \"I know,\" said Jimmy. \"I felt that I could rely on your womanly  sympathy. Where shall we go?\"    \"Where do you want to go? Oh, I forget that you have never been  in New York before. By the way, what are your impressions of our  glorious country?\"    \"Most gratifying, if only I could get a job.\"    \"Tell him to drive to Delmonico's. It's just around the corner on  Forty-fourth Street.\"    \"There are some things round the corner, then?\"    \"That sounds cryptic. What do you mean.\"    \"You've forgotten our conversation that night on the ship. You  refused to admit the existence of wonderful things just round the  corner. You said some very regrettable things that night. About  love, if you remember.\"    \"You can't be going to talk about love at one o'clock in the  afternoon! Talk about your future.\"    \"Love is inextricably mixed up with my future.\"    \"Not with your immediate future. I thought you said that you were  trying to get a job. Have you given up the idea of newspaper  work, then?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    \"Well, I'm rather glad.\"    The cab drew up at the restaurant door, and the conversation was  interrupted. When they were seated at their table and Jimmy had  given an order to the waiter of absolutely inexcusable  extravagance, Ann returned to the topic.    \"Well, now the thing is to find something for you to do.\"    Jimmy looked round the restaurant with appreciative eyes. The  summer exodus from New York was still several weeks distant, and  the place was full of prosperous-looking lunchers, not one of  whom appeared to have a care or an unpaid bill in the world. The  atmosphere was redolent of substantial bank-balances. Solvency  shone from the closely shaven faces of the men and reflected  itself in the dresses of the women. Jimmy sighed.    \"I suppose so,\" he said. \"Though for choice I'd like to be one of  the Idle Rich. To my mind the ideal profession is strolling into  the office and touching the old dad for another thousand.\"    Ann was severe.    \"You revolt me!\" she said. \"I never heard anything so thoroughly  disgraceful. You _need_ work!\"    \"One of these days,\" said Jimmy plaintively, \"I shall be sitting  by the roadside with my dinner-pail, and you will come by in your  limousine, and I shall look up at you and say '_You_ hounded me  into this!' How will you feel then?\"    \"Very proud of myself.\"    \"In that case, there is no more to be said. I'd much rather hang  about and try to get adopted by a millionaire, but if you insist  on my working--Waiter!\"    \"What do you want?\" asked Ann.    \"Will you get me a Classified Telephone Directory,\" said Jimmy.    \"What for?\" asked Ann.    \"To look for a profession. There is nothing like being  methodical.\"    The waiter returned, bearing a red book. Jimmy thanked him and  opened it at the A's.    \"The boy, what will he become?\" he said. He turned the pages.  \"How about an Auditor? What do you think of that?\"    \"Do you think you could audit?\"    \"That I could not say till I had tried. I might turn out to be  very good at it. How about an Adjuster?\"    \"An adjuster of what?\"    \"The book doesn't say. It just remarks broadly--in a sort of  spacious way--'Adjuster.' I take it that, having decided to  become an adjuster, you then sit down and decide what you wish to  adjust. One might, for example, become an Asparagus Adjuster.\"    \"A what?\"    \"Surely you know? Asparagus Adjusters are the fellows who sell  those rope-and-pulley affairs by means of which the Smart Set  lower asparagus into their mouths--or rather Francis the footman  does it for them, of course. The diner leans back in his chair,  and the menial works the apparatus in the background. It is  entirely superseding the old-fashioned method of picking the  vegetable up and taking a snap at it. But I suspect that to be a  successful Asparagus Adjuster requires capital. We now come to  Awning Crank and Spring Rollers. I don't think I should like  that. Rolling awning cranks seems to me a sorry way of spending  life's springtime. Let's try the B's.\"    \"Let's try this omelette. It looks delicious.\" Jimmy shook his  head.    \"I will toy with it--but absently and in a _distrait_ manner, as  becomes a man of affairs. There's nothing in the B's. I might  devote my ardent youth to Bar-Room Glassware and Bottlers'  Supplies. On the other hand, I might not. Similarly, while there  is no doubt a bright future for somebody in Celluloid, Fiberloid,  and Other Factitious Goods, instinct tells me that there is none  for--\" he pulled up on the verge of saying, \"James Braithwaite  Crocker,\" and shuddered at the nearness of the pitfall.  \"--for--\" he hesitated again--\"for Algernon Bayliss,\" he  concluded.    Ann smiled delightedly. It was so typical that his father should  have called him something like that. Time had not dimmed her  regard for the old man she had seen for that brief moment at  Paddington Station. He was an old dear, and she thoroughly  approved of this latest manifestation of his supposed pride in  his offspring.    \"Is that really your name--Algernon?\"    \"I cannot deny it.\"    \"I think your father is a darling,\" said Ann inconsequently.    Jimmy had buried himself in the directory again.    \"The D's,\" he said. \"Is it possible that posterity will know me  as Bayliss the Dermatologist? Or as Bayliss the Drop Forger? I  don't quite like that last one. It may be a respectable  occupation, but it sounds rather criminal to me. The sentence for  forging drops is probably about twenty years with hard labour.\"    \"I wish you would put that book away and go on with your lunch,\"  said Ann.    \"Perhaps,\" said Jimmy, \"my grandchildren will cluster round my  knee some day and say in their piping, childish voices, 'Tell us  how you became the Elastic Stocking King, grandpa!' What do you  think?\"    \"I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You are wasting  your time, when you ought to be either talking to me or else  thinking very seriously about what you mean to do.\"    Jimmy was turning the pages rapidly.    \"I will be with you in a moment,\" he said. \"Try to amuse yourself  somehow till I am at leisure. Ask yourself a riddle. Tell  yourself an anecdote. Think of life. No, it's no good. I don't  see myself as a Fan Importer, a Glass Beveller, a Hotel Broker,  an Insect Exterminator, a Junk Dealer, a Kalsomine Manufacturer,  a Laundryman, a Mausoleum Architect, a Nurse, an Oculist, a  Paper-Hanger, a Quilt Designer, a Roofer, a Ship Plumber, a  Tinsmith, an Undertaker, a Veterinarian, a Wig Maker, an X-ray  apparatus manufacturer, a Yeast producer, or a Zinc Spelter.\" He  closed the book. \"There is only one thing to do. I must starve in  the gutter. Tell me--you know New York better than I do--where is  there a good gutter?\"    At this moment there entered the restaurant an Immaculate Person.  He was a young man attired in faultlessly fitting clothes, with  shoes of flawless polish and a perfectly proportioned floweret in  his buttonhole. He surveyed the room through a monocle. He was a  pleasure to look upon, but Jimmy, catching sight of him, started  violently and felt no joy at all; for he had recognised him. It  was a man he knew well and who knew him well--a man whom he had  last seen a bare two weeks ago at the Bachelors' Club in London.  Few things are certain in this world, but one was that, if  Bartling--such was the Vision's name--should see him, he would  come over and address him as Crocker. He braced himself to the  task of being Bayliss, the whole Bayliss, and nothing but  Bayliss. It might be that stout denial would carry him through.  After all, Reggie Bartling was a man of notoriously feeble  intellect, who could believe in anything.    The monocle continued its sweep. It rested on Jimmy's profile.    \"By Gad!\" said the Vision.    Reginald Bartling had landed in New York that morning, and  already the loneliness of a strange city had begun to oppress  him. He had come over on a visit of pleasure, his suit-case  stuffed with letters of introduction, but these he had not yet  used. There was a feeling of home-sickness upon him, and he ached  for a pal. And there before him sat Jimmy Crocker, one of the  best. He hastened to the table.    \"I say, Crocker, old chap, I didn't know you were over here. When  did you arrive?\"    Jimmy was profoundly thankful that he had seen this pest in time  to be prepared for him. Suddenly assailed in this fashion, he  would undoubtedly have incriminated himself by recognition of his  name. But, having anticipated the visitation, he was able to say  a whole sentence to Ann before showing himself aware that it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#19)"],[1," we have no eye in our stomachs.  But, just as  there WAS the realm of Flatland, though that poor puny Lineland Monarch  could neither turn to left nor right to discern it, and just as there  WAS close at hand, and touching my frame, the land of Three Dimensions,  though I, blind senseless wretch, had no power to touch it, no eye in  my interior to discern it, so of a surety there is a Fourth Dimension,  which my Lord perceives with the inner eye of thought.  And that it  must exist my Lord himself has taught me.  Or can he have forgotten  what he himself imparted to his servant?    In One Dimension, did not a moving Point produce a Line with TWO  terminal points?    In Two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square with FOUR  terminal points?    In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce--did not this eye  of mine behold it--that blessed Being, a Cube, with EIGHT terminal  points?    And in Four Dimensions shall not a moving Cube--alas, for Analogy, and  alas for the Progress of Truth, if it be not so--shall not, I say, the  motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine Organization with  SIXTEEN terminal points?    Behold the infallible confirmation of the Series, 2, 4, 8, 16: is not  this a Geometrical Progression?  Is not this--if I might quote my  Lord's own words--\"strictly according to Analogy\"?    Again, was I not taught by my Lord that as in a Line there are TWO  bounding Points, and in a Square there are FOUR bounding Lines, so in a  Cube there must be SIX bounding Squares?  Behold once more the  confirming Series, 2, 4, 6:  is not this an Arithmetical Progression?  And consequently does it not of necessity follow that the more divine  offspring of the divine Cube in the Land of Four Dimensions, must have  8 bounding Cubes: and is not this also, as my Lord has taught me to  believe, \"strictly according to Analogy\"?    O, my Lord, my Lord, behold, I cast myself in faith upon conjecture,  not knowing the facts; and I appeal to your Lordship to confirm or deny  my logical anticipations.  If I am wrong, I yield, and will no longer  demand a fourth Dimension; but, if I am right, my Lord will listen to  reason.    I ask therefore, is it, or is it not, the fact, that ere now your  countrymen also have witnessed the descent of Beings of a higher order  than their own, entering closed rooms, even as your Lordship entered  mine, without the opening of doors or windows, and appearing and  vanishing at will?  On the reply to this question I am ready to stake  everything.  Deny it, and I am henceforth silent.  Only vouchsafe an  answer.    SPHERE.  (AFTER A PAUSE).  It is reported so.  But men are divided in  opinion as to the facts.  And even granting the facts, they explain  them in different ways.  And in any case, however great may be the  number of different explanations, no one has adopted or suggested the  theory of a Fourth Dimension.  Therefore, pray have done with this  trifling, and let us return to business.    I.  I was certain of it.  I was certain that my anticipations would be  fulfilled.  And now have patience with me and answer me yet one more  question, best of Teachers!  Those who have thus appeared--no one knows  whence--and have returned--no one knows whither--have they also  contracted their sections and vanished somehow into that more Spacious  Space, whither I now entreat you to conduct me?    SPHERE (MOODILY).  They have vanished, certainly--if they ever  appeared.  But most people say that these visions arose from the  thought--you will not understand me--from the brain; from the perturbed  angularity of the Seer.    I.  Say they so?  Oh, believe them not.  Or if it indeed be so, that  this other Space is really Thoughtland, then take me to that blessed  Region where I in Thought shall see the insides of all solid things.  There, before my ravished eye, a Cube, moving in some altogether new  direction, but strictly according to Analogy, so as to make every  particle of his interior pass through a new kind of Space, with a wake  of its own--shall create a still more perfect perfection than himself,  with sixteen terminal Extra-solid angles, and Eight solid Cubes for his  Perimeter.  And once there, shall we stay our upward course?  In that  blessed region of Four Dimensions, shall we linger on the threshold of  the Fifth, and not enter therein?  Ah, no!  Let us rather resolve that  our ambition shall soar with our corporal ascent.  Then, yielding to  our intellectual onset, the gates of the Sixth Dimension shall fly  open; after that a Seventh, and then an Eighth-- How long I should have  continued I know not.  In vain did the Sphere, in his voice of thunder,  reiterate his command of silence, and threaten me with the direst  penalties if I persisted.  Nothing could stem the flood of my ecstatic  aspirations.  Perhaps I was to blame; but indeed I was intoxicated with  the recent draughts of Truth to which he himself had introduced me.  However, the end was not long in coming.  My words were cut short by a  crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me, which impelled me  through space with a velocity that precluded speech.  Down! down! down!  I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return to Flatland was my  doom.  One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten glimpse I had of  that dull level wilderness--which was now to become my Universe  again--spread out before my eye.  Then a darkness.  Then a final,  all-consummating thunder-peal; and, when I came to myself, I was once  more a common creeping Square, in my Study at home, listening to the  Peace-Cry of my approaching Wife.          Section 20.  How the Sphere encouraged me in a Vision        Although I had less than a minute for reflection, I felt, by a kind of  instinct, that I must conceal my experiences from my Wife.  Not that I  apprehended, at the moment, any danger from her divulging my secret,  but I knew that to any Woman in Flatland the narrative of my adventures  must needs be unintelligible.  So I endeavoured to reassure her by some  story, invented for the occasion, that I had accidentally fallen  through the trap-door of the cellar, and had there lain stunned.    The Southward attraction in our country is so slight that even to a  Woman my tale necessarily appeared extraordinary and well-nigh  incredible; but my Wife, whose good sense far exceeds that of the  average of her Sex, and who perceived that I was unusually excited, did  not argue with me on the subject, but insisted that I was ill and  required repose.  I was glad of an excuse for retiring to my chamber to  think quietly over what had happened.  When I was at last by myself, a  drowsy sensation fell on me; but before my eyes closed I endeavoured to  reproduce the Third Dimension, and especially the process by which a  Cube is constructed through the motion of a Square.  It was not so  clear as I could have wished; but I remembered that it must be \"Upward,  and yet not Northward\", and I determined steadfastly to retain these  words as the clue which, if firmly grasped, could not fail to guide me  to the solution.  So mechanically repeating, like a charm, the words,  \"Upward, yet not Northward\", I fell into a sound refreshing sleep.    During my slumber I had a dream.  I thought I was once more by the side  of the Sphere, whose lustrous hue betokened that he had exchanged his  wrath against me for perfect placability.  We were moving together  towards a bright but infinitesimally small Point, to which my Master  directed my attention.  As we approached, methought there issued from  it a slight humming noise as from one of your Spaceland bluebottles,  only less resonant by far, so slight indeed that even in the perfect  stillness of the Vacuum through which we soared, the sound reached not  our ears till we checked our flight at a distance from it of something  under twenty human diagonals.    \"Look yonder,\" said my Guide, \"in Flatland thou hast lived; of Lineland  thou hast received a vision; thou hast soared with me to the heights of  Spaceland; now, in order to complete the range of thy experience, I  conduct thee downward to the lowest depth of existence, even to the  realm of Pointland, the Abyss of No dimensions.    \"Behold yon miserable creature.  That Point is a Being like ourselves,  but confined to the non-dimensional Gulf.  He is himself his own World,  his own Universe; of any other than himself he can form no conception;  he knows not Length, nor Breadth, nor Height, for he has had no  experience of them; he has no cognizance even of the number Two; nor  has he a thought of Plurality; for he is himself his One and All, being  really Nothing.  Yet mark his perfect self-contentment, and hence learn  this lesson, that to be self-contented is to be vile and ignorant, and  that to aspire is better than to be blindly and impotently happy.  Now  listen.\"    He ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny,  low, monotonous, but distinct tinkling, as from one of your Spaceland  phonographs, from which I caught these words, \"Infinite beatitude of  existence!  It is; and there is none else beside It.\"    \"What,\" said I, \"does the puny creature mean by 'it'?\" \"He means  himself,\" said the Sphere:  \"have you not noticed before now, that  babies and babyish people who cannot distinguish themselves from the  world, speak of themselves in the Third Person?  But hush!\"    \"It fills all Space,\" continued the little soliloquizing Creature, \"and  what It fills, It is.  What It thinks, that It utters; and what It  utters, that It hears; and It itself is Thinker, Utterer, Hearer,  Thought, Word, Audition; it is the One, and yet the All in All.  Ah,  the happiness ah, the happiness of Being!\"    \"Can you not startle the little thing out of its complacency?\" said I.  \"Tell it what it really is, as you told me; reveal to it the narrow  limitations of Pointland, and lead it up to something higher.\"  \"That  is no easy"]]]
