Naza! Naza! What does it mean?\"    \"No white man knows; no Indian will tell,\" answered the interpreter.  \"The traders think it means the Great Slave, the North Star, the North  Spirit, the North Wind, the North Lights and the musk-ox god.\"    \"Well, say to the chiefs to tell Ageter I have been four moons on the  way after some of his little Ageters, and I'm going to keep on after  them.\"    \"Hunter, you are most unwise,\" broke in the commandant, in his  officious voice. \"The Indians will never permit you to take a musk-ox  alive from the north. They worship him, pray to him. It is a wonder you  have not been stopped.\"    \"Who'll stop me?\"    \"The Indians. They will kill you if you do not turn back.\"    \"Faugh! to tell an American plainsman that!\" The hunter paused a steady  moment, with his eyelids narrowing over slits of blue fire. \"There is  no law to keep me out, nothing but Indian superstition and Naza! And  the greed of the Hudson's Bay people. I am an old fox, not to be fooled  by pretty baits. For years the officers of this fur-trading company  have tried to keep out explorers. Even Sir John Franklin, an  Englishman, could not buy food of them. The policy of the company is to  side with the Indians, to keep out traders and trappers. Why? So they  can keep on cheating the poor savages out of clothing and food by  trading a few trinkets and blankets, a little tobacco and rum for  millions of dollars worth of furs. Have I failed to hire man after man,  Indian after Indian, not to know why I cannot get a helper? Have I, a  plainsman, come a thousand miles alone to be scared by you, or a lot of  craven Indians? Have I been dreaming of musk-oxen for forty years, to  slink south now, when I begin to feel the north? Not I.\"    Deliberately every chief, with the sound of a hissing snake, spat in  the hunter's face. He stood immovable while they perpetrated the  outrage, then calmly wiped his cheeks, and in his strange, cool voice,  addressed the interpreter.    \"Tell them thus they show their true qualities, to insult in council.  Tell them they are not chiefs, but dogs. Tell them they are not even  squaws, only poor, miserable starved dogs. Tell them I turn my back on  them. Tell them the paleface has fought real chiefs, fierce, bold, like  eagles, and he turns his back on dogs. Tell them he is the one who  could teach them to raise the musk-oxen and the reindeer, and to keep  out the cold and the wolf. But they are blinded. Tell them the hunter  goes north.\"    Through the council of chiefs ran a low mutter, as of gathering thunder.    True to his word, the hunter turned his back on them. As he brushed by,  his eye caught a gaunt savage slipping from the boat. At the hunter's  stern call, the Indian leaped ashore, and started to run. He had stolen  a parcel, and would have succeeded in eluding its owner but for an  unforeseen obstacle, as striking as it was unexpected.    A white man of colossal stature had stepped in the thief's passage, and  laid two great hands on him. Instantly the parcel flew from the Indian,  and he spun in the air to fall into the river with a sounding splash.  Yells signaled the surprise and alarm caused by this unexpected  incident. The Indian frantically swam to the shore. Whereupon the  champion of the stranger in a strange land lifted a bag, which gave  forth a musical clink of steel, and throwing it with the camp articles  on the grassy bench, he extended a huge, friendly hand.    \"My name is Rea,\" he said, in deep, cavernous tones.    \"Mine is Jones,\" replied the hunter, and right quickly did he grip the  proffered hand. He saw in Rea a giant, of whom he was but a stunted  shadow. Six and one-half feet Rea stood, with yard-wide shoulders, a  hulk of bone and brawn. His ponderous, shaggy head rested on a bull  neck. His broad face, with its low forehead, its close-shut mastiff  under jaw, its big, opaque eyes, pale and cruel as those of a jaguar,  marked him a man of terrible brute force.    \"Free-trader!\" called the commandant \"Better think twice before you  join fortunes with the musk-ox hunter.\"    \"To hell with you an' your rantin', dog-eared redskins!\" cried Rea.  \"I've run agin a man of my own kind, a man of my own country, an' I'm  goin' with him.\"    With this he thrust aside some encroaching, gaping Indians so  unconcernedly and ungently that they sprawled upon the grass.    Slowly the crowd mounted and once more lined the bank.    Jones realized that by some late-turning stroke of fortune, he had  fallen in with one of the few free-traders of the province. These  free-traders, from the very nature of their calling, which was to defy  the fur company, and to trap and trade on their own account--were a  hardy and intrepid class of men. Rea's worth to Jones exceeded that of  a dozen ordinary men. He knew the ways of the north, the language of  the tribes, the habits of animals, the handling of dogs, the uses of  food and fuel. Moreover, it soon appeared that he was a carpenter and  blacksmith.    \"There's my kit,\" he said, dumping the contents of his bag. It  consisted of a bunch of steel traps, some tools, a broken ax, a box of  miscellaneous things such as trappers used, and a few articles of  flannel. \"Thievin' redskins,\" he added, in explanation of his poverty.  \"Not much of an outfit. But I'm the man for you. Besides, I had a pal  onct who knew you on the plains, called you 'Buff' Jones. Old Jim Bent  he was.\"    \"I recollect Jim,\" said Jones. \"He went down in Custer's last charge.  So you were Jim's pal. That'd be a recommendation if you needed one.  But the way you chucked the Indian overboard got me.\"    Rea soon manifested himself as a man of few words and much action. With  the planks Jones had on board he heightened the stern and bow of the  boat to keep out the beating waves in the rapids; he fashioned a  steering-gear and a less awkward set of oars, and shifted the cargo so  as to make more room in the craft.    \"Buff, we're in for a storm. Set up a tarpaulin an' make a fire. We'll  pretend to camp to-night. These Indians won't dream we'd try to run the  river after dark, and we'll slip by under cover.\"    The sun glazed over; clouds moved up from the north; a cold wind swept  the tips of the spruces, and rain commenced to drive in gusts. By the  time it was dark not an Indian showed himself. They were housed from  the storm. Lights twinkled in the teepees and the big log cabins of the  trading company. Jones scouted round till pitchy black night, when a  freezing, pouring blast sent him back to the protection of the  tarpaulin. When he got there he found that Rea had taken it down and  awaited him. \"Off!\" said the free-trader; and with no more noise than a  drifting feather the boat swung into the current and glided down till  the twinkling fires no longer accentuated the darkness.    By night the river, in common with all swift rivers, had a sullen  voice, and murmured its hurry, its restraint, its menace, its meaning.  The two boat-men, one at the steering gear, one at the oars, faced the  pelting rain and watched the dim, dark line of trees. The craft slid  noiselessly onward into the gloom.    And into Jones's ears, above the storm, poured another sound, a steady,  muffled rumble, like the roll of giant chariot wheels. It had come to  be a familiar roar to him, and the only thing which, in his long life  of hazard, had ever sent the cold, prickling, tight shudder over his  warm skin. Many times on the Athabasca that rumble had presaged the  dangerous and dreaded rapids.    \"Hell Bend Rapids!\" shouted Rea. \"Bad water, but no rocks.\"    The rumble expanded to a roar, the roar to a boom that charged the air  with heaviness, with a dreamy burr. The whole indistinct world appeared  to be moving to the lash of wind, to the sound of rain, to the roar of  the river. The boat shot down and sailed aloft, met shock on shock,  breasted leaping dim white waves, and in a hollow, unearthly blend of  watery sounds, rode on and on, buffeted, tossed, pitched into a black  chaos that yet gleamed with obscure shrouds of light. Then the  convulsive stream shrieked out a last defiance, changed its course  abruptly to slow down and drown the sound of rapids in muffling  distance. Once more the craft swept on smoothly, to the drive of the  wind and the rush of the rain.    By midnight the storm cleared. Murky cloud split to show shining,  blue-white stars and a fitful moon, that silvered the crests of the  spruces and sometimes hid like a gleaming, black-threaded peak behind  the dark branches.    Jones, a plainsman all his days, wonderingly watched the moon-blanched  water. He saw it shade and darken under shadowy walls of granite, where  it swelled with hollow song and gurgle. He heard again the far-off  rumble, faint on the night. High cliff banks appeared, walled out the  mellow, light, and the river suddenly narrowed. Yawning holes,  whirlpools of a second, opened with a gurgling suck and raced with the  boat.    On the craft flew. Far ahead, a long, declining plane of jumping  frosted waves played dark and white with the moonbeams. The Slave  plunged to his freedom, down his riven, stone-spiked bed, knowing no  patient eddy, and white-wreathed his dark shiny rocks in spume and  spray.        CHAPTER 9.    THE LAND OF THE MUSK-OX    A far cry it was from bright June at Port Chippewayan to dim October on  Great Slave Lake.    Two long, laborious months Rea and Jones threaded the crooked shores of  the great inland sea, to halt at the extreme northern end, where a  plunging rivulet formed the source of a river. Here they found a stone  chimney and fireplace standing among the darkened, decayed ruins of a  cabin.    \"We mustn't lose no time,\" said Rea. \"I feel the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#19)"],[1,"  One of the older group of song composers is Clara Angela Macironi, whose  work has been known many years. Born in 1821, she studied in the  Academy, and became one of its professors. Her suite for violin and  piano is well written, but she is known to the general public chiefly by  her part-songs. Some of these have been sung by three thousand voices  at the Crystal Palace. She has published many songs for solo voice also,  but these are hardly equal in musical worth to the productions of the  more recent geniuses.    Less high in standard, but vastly popular, are the songs of Hope Temple,  of whose works \"My Lady's Bower\" and \"In Sweet September\" are probably  familiar in many households. Edith Cooke has found a vein of dainty  playfulness in \"Two Marionettes\" and other similar songs. The  productions of Kate Lucy Ward are graceful and musicianly, while  Katharine Ramsay has written some admirable children's songs. Without  enumerating more, it may be worth mentioning that the famous Patti has  tried her hand at composing songs, and that Lady Tennyson has set some  of her husband's lyrics, although he is said to have been tone-deaf and  unable to appreciate any music.    The Irish songs of Alicia Adelaide Needham are said to be exceptionally  good, and thoroughly new and local in flavour. Ireland is also  represented among women composers by Christina Morison, who produced a  three-act opera, \"The Uhlans,\" and wrote many songs; Lady Helen Selina  Dufferin, whose songs are widely known, especially the \"Lay of the Irish  Emigrant;\" and Lady Morgan, born in the eighteenth century at Dublin,  and known through her operetta, \"The First Attempt.\"    Scotland can show no great woman composer. There are a few ballad  writers besides those already mentioned, but they are of little  importance. Wales can boast one musical daughter in Llewela Davies, who  won a large collection of prizes while at the Royal Academy. Her works  include three sketches for orchestra, a string quartette, a number of  songs, and a violin sonata that received a London performance in 1894,  and was highly praised by the critics.[6]          CHAPTER VII.    GERMANY      It is only natural that the country whose composers have led the world  for more than two centuries should produce many musical women. The list  excels not only in point of length, but in merit and priority. It begins  with the nun Roswitha, or Helen von Rossow, who flourished at the end of  the tenth century, and won renown by her poetry, some of which she set  to music. But in modern times many important names are found in Germany  at a time when few or none appear in other countries.    Music was considered a proper relaxation for royalty, and in the  eighteenth century every petty court aimed to keep its orchestra and  performers, while very often the exalted hearers would try their own  hands at playing or composing. Frederick the Great was especially fond  of music, and played the flute with much skill and persistence, and his  sister, the Princess Anna Amalie, was as gifted as her brother in a  musical way. She wrote many compositions, of which an organ trio has  been published in a Leipsic collection, while her cantata, \"Der Tod  Jesu,\" represents a more ambitious vein. Contemporary with her was Maria  Antonia, daughter of the Emperor Charles VII., and pupil of such famous  men as Porpora and Hasse. Her musical aspirations took the form of  operas, of which two, \"Il Trionfo della Fedelta\" and \"Talestri,\" have  been published recently. Amalia Anna, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, composed  the incidental music for Goethe's melodrama, \"Erwin and Elmira,\" and won  flattering notices, though part of their praise may have been due to her  rank. Maria Charlotte Amalie, Duchess of Saxe-Gotha, published several  songs, and wrote a symphony for an orchestra of ten instruments.    Coming into the nineteenth century, we find the Princess Amalie of  Saxony possessed of considerable talent. Her skill showed itself in the  form of various pieces of church music and no less than fourteen operas,  best among them \"Die Siegesfahne\" and \"Der Kanonenschuss.\" The Empress  Augusta herself, wife of Kaiser Wilhelm I., besides always fostering the  art of music, was gifted with a talent for composing, even in the larger  forms. Among her works are an overture, the ballet \"Die Maskerade,\" and  several marches, of which one is on the German army lists at present.  Princess Charlotte of Saxe-Meiningen, who lived but twenty-four years,  found time to compose several marches and a number of songs and piano  pieces.    Among living composers, Princess Beatrice of Battenberg is the author of  a number of melodious songs, also an orchestral march and some church  responses. Saxe-Meiningen seems to hold its own in the present as well  as the past. Princess Charlotte, daughter of the Emperor Frederick III.,  has composed some military and Turkish marches, also a tuneful \"Cradle  Song\" for violin and piano. Marie Elizabeth, of the same principality,  counts among her works an \"Einzugsmarsch\" for orchestra, a Torch Dance  for two pianos, a number of piano pieces, and a Romanze for clarinet and  piano.    One of the most notable female figures in German music was Maria Theresa  von Paradies. Born at Vienna in 1759, she met with an accident when  three years old, and became blind for life. Even with this drawback,  however, her musical aptitude was so great that her parents were  justified in letting her begin regular studies and procuring the best  teachers for her. At the age of eleven she appeared in public, singing  the soprano part of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater, and playing her own  accompaniment on the organ. This interested the Empress Maria Theresa,  who procured the best of teachers for her. She made such rapid progress  in piano that at her first concert she was able to arouse the utmost  enthusiasm by her expressive and sympathetic performance. She made a  number of concert tours, winning plaudits everywhere. In Paris, where  she stayed six months, she appeared at the Concerts Spirituelles, and  played frequently before Marie Antoinette. After various royal audiences  in England and Germany, she returned to Vienna, where she soon retired  from public life, and devoted herself to teaching and composition.    Her memory was something phenomenal. It is said that she was able to  play no less than sixty concertos with the most absolute accuracy,  besides knowing any number of smaller piano works. Her power of  concentration is also made evident by the fact that she would dictate  her own compositions, note by note, without the slightest alteration.  Very few, even among the great composers, have possessed this faculty.  Wagner and Mendelssohn were perhaps the most gifted. Beethoven's great  works were the result of much careful correction, and in some cases  represent as many as six or eight revisions.    Her compositions have won praise from the greatest musicians, and show  merit of a high order. Among her dramatic works, the most successful in  point of performance are \"Rinaldo and Alcina,\" a fairy opera  (appreciated in its day much as \"Hansel and Gretel\" is in our own), the  melodrama \"Ariadne and Bacchus,\" and the pastoral operetta \"Der  Schulcandidat.\" Her other works include a piano trio, a number of  sonatas and variations for piano, several songs and other vocal works,  besides a few cantatas. Her remarkable gifts won her the friendship of  the foremost musicians of her time. Among others Mozart admired her  greatly, and dedicated a concerto to her.    Another figure of musical importance was Marianne Martinez. Born at  Vienna in 1744, she began her musical studies while still a child. Her  first efforts at composition were made when she was twelve years old,  and met with a most favourable reception, though of course they cannot  compare with her later productions. She was an excellent pianist, or  what would correspond to a pianist in our day, and among her teachers on  the harpsichord was Haydn himself. She became equally proficient in  singing, under the great teacher, Porpora, and the historian Burney  speaks of her vocal accomplishments with unstinted praise.    Among the works of her maturer period, her church music ranks highest  of all. Her oratorio \"Isacco,\" with words by Metastasio, is her  worthiest production, and met with deserved success when performed at  Vienna in 1788. Besides this work, she composed two other oratorios, a  successful mass, a four-part Miserere, a number of psalms for four and  eight voices, with orchestral accompaniment, several motets, and many  other pieces of a religious character. The list of her works does not  end here, but comprises symphonies, overtures, and other orchestral  numbers, including several piano concertos. Taken as a whole, her works  entitle her to a worthy place among women composers of all time.    Leaving the eighteenth century, the next woman composer of note is  Emilie Zumsteeg. Born at Stuttgart in 1796, she soon showed that she had  inherited the musical taste of her father, himself a well-known  composer. On his death, six years later, the widow supported herself by  keeping a music-store, where the growing daughter absorbed much  knowledge of the art. Soon she began regular study, and won her way into  notice by her singing and piano-playing. Her sight-reading abilities  were something phenomenal, and she could play from full instrumental  scores with ease. Her home became the centre of a brilliant circle,  including Weber, Hummel, Lindpaintner, and poets as well as musicians.  She was much prized as a teacher of piano and singing, and a personal  favourite in her native city. Of her compositions, the most ambitious is  an overture to the play \"Die Geister Insel.\" She wrote also several  piano pieces, among them three polonaises. But according to German  authority,[7] it is her songs that have made her memory honoured. Her"]]]
