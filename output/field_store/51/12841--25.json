I never  chanced to hear your surname. I thought you were Mrs. Rogers' niece.\"    \"And so I am!\" laughed Carmel. \"At least she's my step-aunt, at any  rate. Isn't it a regular _Comedy of Errors_?\"    \"Everard,\" put in Lilias, \"why did you turn chauffeur? We thought you  had run away to sea!\"    \"I meant to,\" answered her brother bitterly, \"but when it came to the  point of getting employment, I found the only thing I could earn a  living at was driving a car. I don't know that I even do that very  decently, but at any rate I'm self-supporting. You'd better leave me  where I am! It's all I'm good for!\"    \"Not a bit of it!\" answered Carmel. \"I've arranged the whole thing in my  mind already. We'll make an exchange. Milner shall take charge of the  car for the Rogers until they can find another chauffeur, and you shall  drive Cousin Clare and Lilias and Dulcie and me back to the Chase. Now  don't begin to talk, for it's quite settled, and for once in my life I  declare I mean to have my own way!\"          CHAPTER XI    A Secret Society      Carmel seldom asserted herself, but if she set her heart on an object  she generally managed to persuade people to her way of thinking. This  case proved no exception, and she contrived with little difficulty to  transfer the amazed but willing Milner temporarily into the service of  Major Rogers, and to instal Everard, minus his chauffeur's uniform, and  looking once more an Ingleton, to drive the Daimler car back to  Cheverley Chase. Perhaps the talk which Major Rogers had with his  one-time \"Johnson\" partly worked the miracle. Exactly what he said was  entirely between themselves, but Everard burst out into eulogies  regarding the Major to Lilias, who was still his chief confidante.    \"One of the best chaps I've ever met! A real good sort! I shan't forget  what he said to me. I can tell you I've come to look at things in a  different light lately. I'll do anything he suggests. I'd trust his  advice sooner than that of anybody I know. I'll have a good talk with  Bowden, and see if he agrees. By Jove! I shall be a surprise packet to  him, shan't I?\"    Mr. Bowden was not nearly so much astonished as Everard had anticipated.  He took his ward's return quite as a matter of course, and, lawyer-like,  at once turned to the business side of affairs. After running away and  gaining his own living for so many months, it was neither possible nor  desirable for Everard to go back to Harrow. He had broken the last link  with his school days, and must face the problem of his future career.  His grandfather had wished him to go on to Cambridge, and his guardian  also considered it would be advisable for him to take a university  degree. Meantime his studies were very much in arrears. He had never  worked hard at school, and would need considerable application to his  books before being ready to begin his terms at college. By the advice of  Major Rogers, Mr. Bowden decided to engage a tutor to coach him at the  Chase. The house would be perfectly quiet while the girls and the  younger boys were away at school, and as Everard really seemed to take  the matter seriously, he might be expected to make good progress.    In the matter of a tutor, Major Rogers was fortunately able to recommend  just the right man. Mr. Stacey had been studying for orders at Cambridge  when he was called up, and had joined the army. After serious wounds in  France he had made a slow recovery, and though perfectly able to act as  coach, he would be glad of a period of quiet in the country before  returning to Cambridge. He was a brilliant scholar and a thoroughly good  all-round fellow, who might be trusted to make the best possible  companion for Everard in the circumstances. The whole business was fixed  up at once, and he was to arrive within ten days.    \"I'm sorry we shall just miss seeing him!\" said Carmel to Everard, on  the evening before the girls went back to Chilcombe Hall. \"But I shall  think of you studying away at your Maths. You're clever, aren't you,  Everard? I don't know much about English universities, but isn't a  Tripos what you work for at Cambridge? Suppose you came out Senior  Wrangler! We _should_ be proud of you!\"    \"No fear of that, I'm afraid, Carmel! I'm a long way behind and shall  have to swat like anything to get myself up to even ordinary standard.  Burn the midnight oil, and all that kind of weariness to the flesh!\"    \"But you'll do it!\" (Carmel was looking at him critically.) \"You've got  the right shape of head. Daddy and one of his friends, Signor Penati,  were fearfully keen on phrenology, and they used to make me notice the  shape of people's heads, and of the Greek and Roman busts in the  museums. It's wonderful how truly they tell character: the rules hardly  ever fail.\"    \"What do you make of my particular phiz, then, you young Sicilian  witch?\"    \"Great ability if you only persevere; a noble mind and patriotism--your  forehead is just like the bust of the Emperor Augustus. You'd scorn  bribes, and speak out for the right. I prophesy that you'll some day get  into Parliament, and do splendid work for your country!\"    \"Whew! I'm afraid I'll never reach your expectations. It's a big order  you've laid down for me.\"    \"You could do it, though, if you try. Oh, don't contradict me, for I  know! I haven't studied heads with Signor Penati for nothing. First  you're going to make a good master of the Chase, and then you'll help  England.\"    \"Not of the Chase, Carmel,\" said Everard gently. \"We've argued that  point out thoroughly, I think.\"    \"No, no! Let me tell you once again that I don't want to be mistress  here. I only came over to England to please Mother and Daddy. I'm going  back to Sicily to live, as soon as I can choose for myself. Directly I'm  twenty-one I shall hand over the Chase to you. You're a far more  suitable owner for it than I am. I feel that strongly. It ought never to  have been left to me. But I'll put all that right again. Why can't you  take it?\" she continued eagerly, as Everard shook his head. \"Surely I  can give it to you if I like? Why not?\"    \"Why not? You're too young yet to understand. How could I be such an  utter slacker and sneak as to accept your inheritance? It's unthinkable.  Put that idea out of your little head, for it can never happen. As for  the rest of your prophecy, it's a long climb to get into Parliament. I'm  nothing like the man you think me, Carmel, though I'm going to make a  spurt now, at any rate. Don't expect to find me a Senior Wrangler by  Christmas though. Mr. Stacey will probably tell you I'm an utter  dunderhead.\"    \"I shall quarrel with him if he does!\" said Carmel decidedly.    The three girls went back to school on the following day, half regretful  to leave the Chase, but rather excited at the prospect of meeting their  companions. Now that Carmel had got over her first stage of  homesickness, she liked Chilcombe and had made many friends there. She  intended to enjoy the autumn term to the best of her ability. She had  brought the materials for pursuing several pet hobbies, and she settled  all her numerous possessions into her small bedroom with much  satisfaction. She kept the door into the Blue Grotto open, so that she  might talk during the process. Gowan, also busy unpacking, kept firing  off pieces of information, Bertha flitted in and out like a butterfly,  and girls from other dormitories paid occasional visits.    Phillida, who was a prime favorite, presently came in, and installing  herself on the end of Dulcie's bed, so that she could address the  occupants of both bedrooms, began to draw plans.    \"I've got an idea!\" she announced. \"It's a jolly good one, too, so you  needn't smile. It's a good thing somebody does have ideas in this place,  or you'd all go to sleep! Well, it's this. I really can't stand the  swank of those girls in the Gold bedroom. They seem to imagine the  school belongs to them. They're not very much older than we are, indeed  Nona is actually six weeks younger than Lilias, and yet they give  themselves the airs of all creation. Just now Laurette said to me: 'Get  out of my way, child!' Child, indeed! I'm fifteen, and tall for my age!  I vote that we start a secret society, just among our own set, to resist  them.\"    \"Jolly!\" agreed Dulcie. \"A little wholesome taking down is just what  they need. Laurette's the limit sometimes. Whom shall we ask to join?\"    \"Well, all of you here, and myself, and Noreen, and Prissie, and Edith.  That would make nine.\"    \"Quite enough too,\" said Gowan. \"A secret society's much greater fun if  it's small. Things are apt to leak out when you have too many members. I  take it we want to play an occasional rag on the Gold bedroom? Very  well, the fewer in it the better.\"    \"What shall we call our society?\" asked Dulcie.    \"'The Anti-Swelled Headers' would about suit,\" suggested Lilias.    \"No, no! That sounds as if we were afraid of getting swelled head  ourselves--at least anybody might take it that way.\"    \"There's a big secret society in Sicily called 'The Mafia,'\" vouchsafed  Carmel.    \"Then let us call ours 'The Chilcombe Mafia.' No one will understand  what we mean, even if they get hold of the name. Indeed I shouldn't mind  casually mentioning it now and then, just to puzzle them. When things  get bad, 'The Mafia' will take them up.\"    \"Strike secretly and suddenly!\" agreed Dulcie with a chuckle.    \"Let's sign our names at once!\" declared Phillida enthusiastically.    At Carmel's suggestion, however, they made rather more of a ceremony of  the initiation of their new order. The prospective members retired into  the wood above the garden, and in strict privacy took an oath of  secrecy and service. Then, with Edith's fountain pen filled for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#19)"],[1,"conceal a thing; the glory of the King is to find it  out.\" But the glory of Milton's Deity is to explain a thing. The proud  voluble candour of some of these speeches reminds us only of the author  of _A Defence of the People of England_. In some of them there is even a  flavour of uneasy boastfulness, as of one who is anxious not to be  lessened in the estimation of the rebel adversary.    It may be pleaded that the epical necessities of the poem imposed finite  conceptions, of one sort or another, upon Milton; and that, when once he  had begun to define and explain, he was carried further and further along  that perilous way without being fully conscious of whither he was  tending. Yet his persistent accumulation of harsh and dread traits seems  wilful in its nature; he bases his description, no doubt, on hints from  Scripture, but he pays no attention to any that do not fall in with his  own narrow and gloomy conception. Satan is permitted to rise from the  burning lake--      That with reiterated crimes he might    Heap on himself damnation.    When he arrives at the foot of the stairway that joins Heaven and the  World--      The stairs were then let down, whether to dare    The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate    His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss.    Astronomy, it is suggested by \"the affable Archangel,\" has perhaps been  made a difficult subject in order to produce the droll fallacies of  astronomers:                    He his fabric of the Heavens    Hath left to their disputes--perhaps to move    His laughter at their quaint opinions wide.    And this conjecture is borne out by what happened when the builders of  the tower of Babel were frustrated, for then--                    Great laughter was in Heaven,    And looking down to see the hubbub strange    And hear the din.    Milton, in short, has hardened the heart of the God that hardened  Pharaoh's heart, and has narrowed his love and his power.    Some kind of internal blindness must have visited him if he did not  perceive what must inevitably be the effect of all this on the sympathies  and interest of the reader. And the irony of the thing is that his own  sympathies were not proof against the trial that he had devised for them.  He lavished all his power, all his skill, and, in spite of himself, the  greater part of his sympathy, on the splendid figure of Satan. He avoids  calling _Paradise Lost_ \"an heroic poem\"; when it was printed, in 1667,  the title-page ran merely--_Paradise Lost, A Poem in Ten Books_. Had he  inserted the word \"heroic,\" the question as to who is the hero would have  been broached at once. And to that question, if it be fairly faced, only  one answer can be given,--the answer that has already been given by  Dryden and Goethe, by Lord Chesterfield and Professor Masson. It was not  for nothing that Milton stultified the professed moral of his poem, and  emptied it of all spiritual content. He was not fully conscious, it  seems, of what he was doing; but he builded better than he knew. A  profound poetic instinct taught him to preserve epic truth at all costs.  And the epic value of _Paradise Lost_ is centred in the character and  achievements of Satan.    Satan unavoidably reminds us of Prometheus, and although there are  essential differences, we are not made to feel them essential. His very  situation as the fearless antagonist of Omnipotence makes him either a  fool or a hero, and Milton is far indeed from permitting us to think him  a fool. The nobility and greatness of his bearing are brought home to us  in some half-dozen of the finest poetic passages in the world. The most  stupendous of the poet's imaginative creations are made the foil for a  greater than themselves. Was ever terror more magnificently embodied than  in the phantom figure of Death?--                          The other Shape--    If shape it might be called that shape had none    Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;    Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,    For each seemed either--black it stood as Night,    Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,    And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head    The likeness of a kingly crown had on.    Satan was now at hand, and from his seat    The monster moving onward came as fast    With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.    This is the passage that drew from Burke a rapture of praise. But as it  stands in the poem its elevation is a scaffolding merely, whence we may  view the greatness of Satan:--      The undaunted Fiend what this might be admired--    Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,    Created thing naught valued he nor shunned).    The same magnificent effect of suggestion is wrought even more subtly in  the scene where Satan approaches                              the throne    Of _Chaos_, and his dark pavilion spread    Wide on the wasteful Deep.    Courteously and fearlessly Satan addresses himself to the monarch of the  nethermost abyss. His speech contains no threats; he asks guidance in his  quest; and, with politic forethought, promises that that quest, if  successful, shall restore an outlying lost province to Chaos. There is  nothing in his words to cause consternation; but the King is afraid:--                          Him thus the anarch old,    With faltering speech and visage incomposed,    Answered:--\"I know thee, stranger, who thou art--    That mighty leading Angel, who of late    Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown.\"    In the war on the plains of Heaven Satan ranges up and down the fighting  line, like Cromwell; he fortifies his comrades to endurance, and  encourages them to attack. In Hell he stands like a tower:--                    His form had yet not lost    All her original brightness, nor appeared    Less than Archangel ruined, and the excess    Of glory obscured.    In his contests with Michael in Heaven and with Gabriel on Earth he never  falls below himself:--                      \"If I must contend,\" said he,    \"Best with the best--the sender, not the sent;    Or all at once.\"    But his motive passions, it is objected, were envy, ambition, and hate,  and his end was a crime. To which objection a modern poet has replied  that a crime will serve as a measure for the spirit. Certainly to Satan  there could never be imputed the sin of \"the unlit lamp and the ungirt  loin.\" And Milton has not left him devoid of the gentlest passion, the  passion of pity:--                            Cruel his eye, but cast    Signs of remorse and passion, to behold    The fellows of his crime, the followers rather    (Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned    For ever now to have their lot in pain--    Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced    Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung    For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood,    Their glory withered.    Thrice he attempts to address them, and thrice--                    in spite of scorn    Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth.    His followers are devotedly attached to him; they admire him \"that for  the general safety he despised his own\"; and the only scene of rejoicing  recorded in the annals of Hell, before the Fall of Man, is at the  dissolution of the Stygian Council, when the devils come forth \"rejoicing  in their matchless Chief.\"    As if of set purpose to raise Satan high above the heads of the other  Archangels, Milton devises a pair of similar scenes, in Heaven and in  Hell. In the one Satan takes upon himself the unknown dangers of the  enterprise that has been approved by the assembly. In the other, which  occurs in the very next book, the Heavenly Powers are addressed from the  Throne, and asked--      \"Which of ye will be mortal, to redeem    Man's mortal crime, and just, the unjust to save?    Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?\"      He asked, but all the Heavenly Quire stood mute,    And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf    Patron or intercessor none appeared--    Much less that durst upon his own head draw    The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.    No wonder that Landor--although in another place he declares that Adam is  the hero of _Paradise Lost_, and that \"there is neither truth nor wit\" in  giving that name to Satan--is nevertheless startled by this passage into  the comment, \"I know not what interest Milton could have had in making  Satan so august a creature, and so ready to share the dangers and sorrows  of the angels he had seduced. I know not, on the other hand, what could  have urged him to make the better ones so dastardly that even at the  voice of their Creator not one among them offered his service to rescue  from eternal perdition the last and weakest of intellectual beings.\"    When Satan first comes in sight of Paradisal bliss and the new-created  pair, here surely was a chance for attributing to him the foul passions  of envy and hate unalloyed? On the contrary, he is struck with admiration  for their grace and infused divinity. He could love and pity them--so he  muses--though himself unpitied. He seeks alliance with them, and is  prepared to give them a share in all he has--which, it must be allowed,  is the spirit of true hospitality. He feels it beneath him to attack  innocence and helplessness, but public reasons compel him to do what  otherwise he would abhor:--      So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,    The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds.    But no imputation is cast on the sincerity of the plea, and we are left  to conceive of Satan as of a lover of beauty reluctantly compelled to  shatter it in the pursuit of his high political aims. In the same way,  when he finds Eve alone, on the morning of the temptation, he is disarmed  by her beauty and innocence, and, for a spell, is struck \"stupidly good.\"  Truly, Adam might boast, with Gibbon, that he fell by a noble hand.    It is possible that by the time he had completed the Fourth Book, Milton  became uneasy as to the effect he was"]]]
