And what is stronger than a  lion?\" And he said to them:            \"If with my heifer you did not plough,           You had not solved my riddle now.\"    Then he was suddenly given divine strength, and he went down to Ashkelon  and killed thirty of their men and took the spoil from them and gave the  suits of clothes to those who had guessed the riddle. But he was very  angry and returned to his father's house. And his bride was given to his  comrade who had been his best man.    After a while, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his  wife with a kid as a present; but when he said, \"Let me go into the  inner room to my wife,\" her father would not let him go in, but said, \"I  thought that you must surely hate her, so I gave her to your best man.  Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Take her then, instead.\" But  Samson said to him, \"This time I shall be justified if I do the  Philistines an injury.\" So he went and caught three hundred foxes,  turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between every pair of tails.  When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing  grain of the Philistines and burned up not only the shocks and the  standing grain, but the olive orchards as well.    Then the Philistines said, \"Who has done this?\" The reply was, \"Samson,  the son-in-law of the Timnite, because that man took Samson's wife and  gave her to his best man.\" So the Philistines went up, and burnt her and  her father. Then Samson said to them, \"If this is the way you do, I will  not stop until I have had my revenge on you!\" So he fought fiercely and  killed many of them; then he went and stayed in a cavern in the cliff of  Etam.    When the Philistines went up and camped in Judah and made a raid on  Lehi, the Judahites said, \"Why have you come up against us?\" They  replied, \"We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him what he has done  to us.\" Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cavern in the  cliff of Etam and said to Samson, \"Do you not know that the Philistines  are our rulers? What are you doing to us?\" He replied, \"I have done to  them as they did to me.\" They said to him, \"We have come down to bind  you, to turn you over to the Philistines.\" Samson said to them, \"Swear  to me that you will not attack me yourselves.\" They said to him, \"No; we  will simply bind you securely and deliver you to them; but we will not  kill you.\" So they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from  the cliff.    When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted when they met him. Then he  was suddenly given divine strength, and the ropes that were on his arms  became like flax that has been burned in the fire, and his bonds melted  from his hands. And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and having  seized it, he killed a thousand men with it. Then Samson said:            \"With the jaw-bone of an ass have I piled them, mass on mass;           A thousand warriors have I slain with the jaw-bone of an ass.\"      A STRONG MAN WHO LOST HIS STRENGTH    Afterward, Samson fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek,  named Delilah. Then the rulers of the Philistines came to her and said,  \"Find out by teasing him how it is that his strength is so great and  how we may overpower and bind him that we may torture him. Then we will  each one of us give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.\" So Delilah  said to Samson, \"Tell me how it is that your strength is so great and  how you might be bound to torture you?\" Samson said to her, \"If they  should bind me with seven green bowstrings which have not been dried, I  would become weak like any other man.\"    Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven green bowstrings  which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. She had the men  lying in wait in the inner room, but when she said to him, \"The  Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" he snapped the bowstrings as a piece  of yarn is snapped when it comes near the fire; so they did not find out  the secret of his strength.    Then Delilah said to Samson, \"You have deceived me and lied to me; now  tell me with what you can be bound fast.\" He said to her, \"If they  should bind me securely with new ropes with which no work has been done,  I would become weak like any other man.\" So Delilah took new ropes and  bound him with them and said to him, \"The Philistines are upon you,  Samson!\" Men were also lying in wait in the inner room; but he snapped  the ropes from his arms like thread.    Again Delilah said to Samson, \"So far you have deceived me and lied to  me; tell me now with what you can be bound fast.\" He said to her, \"If  you should weave the seven braids on my head along with the web and beat  it into form with the weaving pin, I would become weak like any other  man.\" So while he was asleep, she took the seven braids of his hair and  wove it with the web and beat it into form with the pin, and said to  him, \"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" But he awoke out of his  sleep and pulled up the loom and the web.    Then she said to him, \"How can you say, 'I love you,' when you do not  trust me? You have deceived me three times already and have not told me  the secret of your great strength.\" But in time, since she daily begged  and urged him, he was wearied to death, and told her all that he knew,  saying, \"A razor has never touched my head; for I have belonged to God  from my birth. If I should be shaved, my strength would be gone, and I  would become weak like any other man.\"    When Delilah saw that he had told her all that he knew, she sent and  called for the rulers of the Philistines and said, \"Come at once, for  he has told me all that he knows.\" Then the rulers of the Philistines  came up to her and brought the money with them. After she had put Samson  to sleep on her knees, she called for a man and had him shave off the  seven braids on his head. Then she began to tease him, and his strength  went from him; and she said, \"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" And  he awoke out of his sleep and thought, \"I will get up as I have done at  other times and shake myself free\"; for he did not know that Jehovah had  left him. So the Philistines seized him and bored out his eyes. Then  they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with chains of brass, and  then he was set to grinding in the prison. But the hair of his head  began to grow again as soon as he was shaved.    Then the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice  to their god Dagon and to rejoice, for they said, \"Our god has given  Samson, our enemy, into our power.\" When the people saw him, they also  praised their god, saying:            \"Our god has laid low our foe,           He who brought our country woe,           He who slew us with many a blow.\"    When they were in high spirits, they said, \"Call Samson that he may  amuse us.\" So they called Samson from the prison and he amused them; and  they placed him between the pillars.    Then Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, \"Let me  touch the pillars on which the building rests, that I may lean against  them.\" Now the building was full of men and women, and all the rulers of  the Philistines were there, and on the roof about three thousand men and  women were looking on while Samson amused them. Samson called on Jehovah  and said, \"O Jehovah, remember me and strengthen me, I pray thee, just  this once, O God, that by one act I may avenge myself on the Philistines  for the loss of my two eyes.\"    Then Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the building  rested, one with his right hand and the other with his left, and leaned  against them. And Samson said, \"Let me die with the Philistines.\" Then  he bent over with all his strength, and the house fell upon the rulers  and upon all the people who were in it. So those whom he killed at his  death were more than those whom he killed during his lifetime.    Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him away and  buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his  father.      THE DEVOTION OF RUTH    During the days of the judges, there was once a famine in the land; and  a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live  in the territory of Moab. His name was Elimelech and his wife's Naomi,  and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. After they had been living in  Moab for some time, Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two  sons. They married Moabite women, named Orpah and Ruth. After they had  lived there about ten years, Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was  left without husband or children.    So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of  Moab, for she had heard that Jehovah had remembered his people and given  them food. As they were setting out on the journey to Judah, Naomi said  to her daughters-in-law, \"Go, return each of you to the home of your  mother. May Jehovah be kind to you, as you have been kind to the dead  and to me. Jehovah grant that each of you may find peace and happiness  in the house of a new husband.\"    Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud and said to her, \"No,  we will return with you to your people.\" But Naomi said, \"Go back, my  daughters; why should you go with me? Can I still have sons who might  become your husbands? Go back, my daughters, go your own way, for I am  too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, 'I have hope,' even if  I should have a husband to-night and should have sons, would you wait  for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No,  my daughters! I am sorry for you, for Jehovah has afflicted me.\" Then  they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but  Ruth stayed with her.    Naomi said, \"See, your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and  to her own gods; go along with her!\" But Ruth answered, \"Do not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#19)"],[1," porcelain pattern; an independent tree or flower being set upon the  white ground, or ground of any color, wherever there was a vacant space  for it, without the smallest attempt to imitate the real colors and  relations of the earth and sky about it. But at the close of the  thirteenth century, Giotto, and in the course of the fourteenth,  Orcagna, sought, for the first time, to give some resemblance to nature  in their backgrounds, and introduced behind their figures pieces of true  landscape, formal enough still, but complete in intention, having  foregrounds and distances, sky and water, forests and mountains,  carefully delineated, not exactly in their true color, but yet in color  approximating to the truth. The system which they introduced (for though  in many points enriched above the work of earlier ages, the Orcagna and  Giotto landscape was a very complete piece of recipe) was observed for a  long period by their pupils, and may be thus briefly described:--The sky  is always pure blue, paler at the horizon, and with a few streaky white  clouds in it, the ground is green even to the extreme distance, with  brown rocks projecting from it; water is blue streaked with white. The  trees are nearly always composed of clusters of their proper leaves  relieved on a black or dark ground, thus (_fig._ 20).[31] And observe  carefully, with respect to the complete drawing of the leaves on this  tree, and the smallness of their number, the real distinction between  noble conventionalism and false conventionalism. You will often hear  modern architects defending their monstrous ornamentation on the ground  that it is \"conventional,\" and that architectural ornament ought to be  conventionalized. Remember, when you hear this, that noble  conventionalism is not an agreement between the artist and spectator  that the one shall misrepresent nature sixty times over, and the other  believe the misrepresentation sixty times over, but it is an agreement  that certain means and limitations being prescribed, only that _kind of  truth_ is to be expected which is consistent with those means. For  instance, if Sir Joshua Reynolds had been talking to a friend about the  character of a face, and there had been nothing in the room but a deal  table and an inkbottle--and no pens--Sir Joshua would have dipped his  finger in the ink, and painted a portrait on the table with his finger,  and a noble portrait too; certainly not delicate in outline, nor  representing any of the qualities of the face dependent on rich outline,  but getting as much of the face as in that manner was attainable. That  is noble conventionalism, and Egyptian work on granite, or illuminator's  work in glass, is all conventional in the same sense, but not  conventionally false. The two noblest and truest carved lions I have  ever seen, are the two granite ones in the Egyptian room of the British  Museum, and yet in them, the lions' manes and beards are represented by  rings of solid rock, as smooth as a mirror!    [Footnote 31: Having no memoranda of my own, taken from Giotto's  landscape, I had this tree copied from an engraving; but I imagine the  rude termination of the stems to be a misrepresentation. Fig. 21 is  accurately copied from a MS., certainly executed between 1250 and 1270,  and is more truly characteristic of the early manner.]    85. There are indeed one or two other conditions of noble  conventionalism, notice more fully in the Addenda (Sec.Sec. 68-71); but you  will find that they always consist in _stopping short_ of nature, not in  falsifying nature; and thus in Giotto's foliage, he _stops short_ of the  quantity of leaves on the real tree, but he gives you the form of the  leaves represented with perfect truth. His foreground also is nearly  always occupied by flowers and herbage, carefully and individually  painted from nature; while, although thus simple in plan, the  arrangements of line in these landscapes of course show the influence of  the master-mind, and sometimes, where the story requires it, we find the  usual formulae overleaped, and Giotto at Avignon painting the breakers of  the sea on a steep shore with great care, while Orcagna, in his Triumph  of Death, has painted a thicket of brambles mixed with teazles, in a  manner worthy of the best days of landscape art.    [Illustration: PLATE XIV. (Fig. 22.)]    86. Now from the landscape of these two men to the landscape of Raphael,  Leonardo, and Perugino, the advance consists principally in two great  steps: The first, that distant objects were more or less invested with a  blue color,--the second, that trees were no longer painted with a black  ground, but with a rich dark brown, or deep green. From Giotto's old  age, to the youth of Raphael, the advance in, and knowledge of,  landscape, consisted of no more than these two simple steps; but the  _execution_ of landscape became infinitely more perfect and elaborate.  All the flowers and leaves in the foreground were worked out with the  same perfection as the features of the figures; in the middle distance  the brown trees were most delicately defined against the sky; the blue  mountains in the extreme distance were exquisitely thrown into aerial  gradations, and the sky and clouds were perfect in transparency and  softness. But still there is no real advance in knowledge of natural  objects. The leaves and flowers are, indeed, admirably painted, and  thrown into various intricate groupings, such as Giotto could not have  attempted, but the rocks and water are still as conventional and  imperfect as ever, except only in color: the forms of rock in Leonardo's  celebrated \"Vierge aux Rochers\" are literally no better than those on a  china plate. _Fig._ 22 shows a portion of them in mere outline, with one  cluster of the leaves above, and the distant \"ideal\" mountains. On the  whole, the most satisfactory work of the period is that which most  resembles missal painting, that is to say, which is fullest of beautiful  flowers and animals scattered among the landscape, in the old  independent way, like the birds upon a screen. The landscape of Benozzo  Gozzoli is exquisitely rich in incident of this kind.    87. The first man who entirely broke through the conventionality of his  time, and painted pure landscape, was Masaccio, but he died too young to  effect the revolution of which his genius was capable. It was left for  other men to accomplish, namely, for Correggio and Titian. These two  painters were the first who relieved the foregrounds of their landscape  from the grotesque, quaint, and crowded formalism of the early painters;  and gave a close approximation to the forms of nature in all things;  retaining, however, thus much of the old system, that the distances were  for the most part painted in deep ultramarine blue, the foregrounds in  rich green and brown; there were no effects of sunshine and shadow, but  a generally quiet glow over the whole scene; and the clouds, though now  rolling in irregular masses, and sometimes richly involved among the  hills, were never varied in conception, or studied from nature. There  were no changes of weather in them, no rain clouds or fair-weather  clouds, nothing but various shapes of the cumulus or cirrus, introduced  for the sake of light on the deep blue sky. Tintoret and Bonifazio  introduced more natural effects into this monotonous landscape: in their  works we meet with showers of rain, with rainbows, sunsets, bright  reflections in water, and so on; but still very subordinate, and  carelessly worked out, so as not to justify us in considering their  landscape as forming a class by itself.    [Illustration: PLATE XV. (Fig. 23.)]    88. _Fig._ 23, which is a branch of a tree from the background of  Titian's \"St. Jerome,\" at Milan, compared with _fig._ 20, will give you  a distinct idea of the kind of change which took place from the time of  Giotto to that of Titian, and you will find that this whole range of  landscape may be conveniently classed in three divisions, namely,  _Giottesque_, _Leonardesque_, and _Titianesque_; the Giottesque  embracing nearly all the work of the fourteenth, the Leonardesque that  of the fifteenth, and the Titianesque that of the sixteenth century. Now  you see there remained a fourth step to be taken,--the doing away  with conventionalism altogether, so as to create the perfect art of  landscape painting. The course of the mind of Europe was to do this; but  at the very moment when it ought to have been done, the art of all  civilized nations was paralyzed at once by the operation of the  poisonous elements of infidelity and classical learning together, as I  have endeavored to show elsewhere. In this paralysis, like a soldier  shot as he is just gaining an eminence, the art of the seventeenth  century struggled forward, and sank upon the spot it had been  endeavoring to attain. The step which should have freed landscape from  conventionalism was actually taken by Claude and Salvator Rosa, but  taken in a state of palsy,--taken so as to lose far more than was  gained. For up to this time, no painter ever had thought of drawing  anything, pebble or blade of grass, or tree or mountain, but as well and  distinctly as he could; and if he could not draw it completely, he drew  it at least in a way which should thoroughly show his knowledge and  feeling of it. For instance, you saw in the oak tree of the Giottesque  period, that the main points of the tree, the true shape of leaf and  acorn, were all there, perfectly and carefully articulated, and so they  continued to be down to the time of Tintoret; both he and Titian working  out the separate leaves of their foliage with the most exquisite  botanical care. But now observe: as Christianity had brought this love  of nature into Paganism, the return of Paganism in the shape of  classical learning at once destroyed this love of nature; and at the  moment when Claude and Salvator made the final effort to"]]]
