An entertainment was provided for the occasion, and  copious libations of a variety of wines were offered for the success of  the undertaking.    The observatory was surrounded by a rampart, each face of which was  three hundred feet long. About the middle of each face the rampart  became a semicircle, the inner diameter of which was ninety feet. The  height of the rampart was twenty-two feet, and its thickness at the base  twenty. Its four angles corresponded exactly with the four cardinal  points, and at the north and south angles were erected turrets, of  which one was a printing-house, and the other the residence of the  servants. Gates were erected at the east and west angles, and above them  were apartments for the reception of strangers. Within the rampart was a  shrubbery with about three hundred varieties of trees; and at the centre  of each semicircular part of the rampart was a bower or summer-house.  This shrubbery surrounded the flower-garden, which was terminated within  by a circular wall about forty-five feet high, which enclosed a more  elevated area, in the centre of which stood the principal building in  the observatory, and from which four paths led to the above-mentioned  angles, with as many doors for entering the garden.    The principal building was about sixty feet square. The doors were  placed on the east and west sides; and to the north and south fronts  were attached two round towers, whose inner diameter was about  thirty-two feet, and which formed the observatories which had windows in  their roof, that could be opened towards any part of the heavens. The  accommodations for the family were numerous and splendid. Under the  observatory, in the south tower, was the museum and library, and below  this again was the laboratory in a subterraneous crypt, containing  sixteen furnaces of various kinds. Beneath this was a well forty feet  deep, from which water was distributed by syphons to every part of the  building.    Besides the principal building there were other two situated without the  rampart, one to the north, containing a workshop for the construction of  astronomical and other instruments, and the other to the south, which  was occupied as a sort of farm-house. These buildings cost the King of  Denmark 100,000 rix-dollars (L20,000), and Tycho is said to have  expended upon them a similar sum.    As the two towers could not accommodate the instruments which Tycho  required for his observations, he found it necessary to erect, on the  hill about sixty paces to the south of Uraniburg, a subterranean  observatory, in which he might place his larger instruments, which  required to be firmly fixed, and to be protected from the wind and the  weather. This observatory, which he called Stiern-berg, or the mountain,  of the stars, consisted of several crypts, separated by solid walls,  and to these there was a subterranean passage from the laboratory in  Uraniburg. The various buildings which Tycho erected were built in a  regular style of architecture, and were highly ornamented, not only with  external decorations, but with the statues and pictures of the most  distinguished astronomers, from Hipparchus and Ptolemy down to  Copernicus, and with inscriptions and poems in honour of astronomers.    While these buildings were erecting, and after their completion, Tycho  was busily occupied in preparing instruments for observation. These were  of the most splendid description, and the reader will form some notion  of their grandeur and their expense from the following list:--       _In the south and greater Observatory._         1. A semicircle of solid iron, covered with brass, four cubits       radius.         2. A sextant of the same materials and size.         3. A quadrant of one and a half cubits radius, and an azimuth       circle of three cubits.         4. Ptolemy's parallactic rules, covered with brass, four cubits in       the side.         5. The sextant already described in page 134.         6. Another quadrant, like No. 3.         7. Zodiacal armillaries of melted brass, and turned out of the       solid, of three cubits in diameter.         Near this observatory was a large clock, with one wheel two cubits       in diameter, and two smaller ones, which, like it, indicated hours,       minutes, and seconds.       _In the south and lesser Observatory._         8. An armillary sphere of brass, with a steel meridian, whose       diameter was about 4 cubits.       _In the north Observatory._         9. Brass parallactic rules, which revolved in azimuth above a brass       horizon, twelve feet in diameter.         10. A half sextant, of four cubits radius.         11. A steel sextant.         12. Another half sextant, with steel limb, four cubits radius.         13. The parallactic rules of Copernicus.         14. Equatorial armillaries.         15. A quadrant of a solid plate of brass, five cubits in radius,       shewing every ten seconds.         16. In the museum was the large globe made at Augsburg, see p. 134.       _In the Stiern-berg Observatory._         17. In the central part, a large semicircle, with a brass limb, and       three clocks, shewing hours, minutes, and seconds.         18. Equatorial armillaries of seven cubits, with semi-armillaries       of nine cubits.         19. A sextant of four cubits radius.         20. A geometrical square of iron, with an intercepted quadrant of       five cubits, and divided into fifteen seconds.         21. A quadrant of four cubits radius, shewing ten seconds, with an       azimuth circle.         22. Zodiacal armillaries of brass, with steel meridians, three       cubits in diameter.         23. A sextant of brass, kept together by screws, and capable of       being taken to pieces for travelling with. Its radius was four       cubits.         24. A moveable armillary sphere, three cubits in diameter.         25. A quadrant of solid brass, one cubit radius, and divided into       minutes by Nonian circles.         26. An astronomical radius of solid brass, three cubits long.         27. An astronomical ring of brass, a cubit in diameter.         28. A small brass astrolabe.    In almost all the instruments now enumerated, the limb was subdivided by  diagonal lines, a method which Tycho first brought into use, but which,  in modern times, has been superseded by the inventions of Nonius and  Vernier.    When Tycho had thus furnished his observatory, he devoted himself to the  examination of the stars; and during the twenty-one years which he spent  in this delightful occupation, he made vast additions to astronomical  science. In order to instruct the young in the art of observation, and  educate assistants for his observatory, he had sometimes under his roof  from six to twelve pupils, whom he boarded and educated. Some of these  were named by the King, and educated at his expense. Others were sent  by different academies and cities; and several, who had presented  themselves of their own accord, were liberally admitted by the generous  astronomer.    As Tycho had spent nearly a ton of gold (about 100,000 dollars) in his  outlay at Uraniburg, his own income was reduced to very narrow limits.  To supply this defect, Frederick gave him an annual pension of 2000  dollars, beside an estate in Norway, and made him Canon of the Episcopal  Church of Rothschild, or Prebend of St Laurence,[39] which had an annual  income of 1000 dollars, and which was burdened only with the expense of  keeping up the chapel containing the Mausolea of the Kings of the family  of Oldenburg.         [39] This office had been usually conferred on the King's       Chancellor.    It would be an unprofitable task, and one by no means interesting to the  general reader, to give a detailed history of the various astronomical  observations and discoveries which were made by Tycho during the twenty  years that he spent at Uraniburg. Every phenomenon that appeared in the  heavens, he observed with the greatest care; while he at the same time  carried on regular series of observations for determining the places of  the fixed stars, and for improving the tables of the sun, moon, and  planets. Though almost wholly devoted to these noble pursuits, yet he  kept an open house, and received, with unbounded hospitality, the crowds  of philosophers, nobles, and princes who came to be introduced to the  first astronomer of the age, and to admire the splendid temple which the  Danish Sovereign had consecrated to science.    Among the strangers whom he received under his roof, there were some who  returned his kindness with ingratitude. Among these was Paul Witichius,  a mathematician; who, under the pretence of devoting his whole life to  astronomy, insinuated himself into the utmost familiarity with Tycho.  The unsuspecting astronomer explained to his guest all his inventions,  described all his methods, and even made him acquainted with those views  which he had not realised, and with instruments which he had not yet  executed. When Witichius had thus obtained possession of the methods,  and inventions, and views of Tycho, and had enjoyed his hospitality for  three months, he pretended that he was obliged to return to Germany to  receive an inheritance to which he had succeeded. After quitting  Uraniburg, this ungrateful mathematician neither returned to see Tycho,  nor kept up any correspondence with him; and it was not till five years  after his departure that Tycho learned, from the letters of the Prince  of Hesse to Ranzau, that Witichius had passed through Hesse, and had  described, as his own, the various inventions and methods which had been  shewn to him in Huen.    Being unable to reconcile his own observations with those of Copernicus,  and with the Prutenic Tables, Tycho resolved to obtain new  determinations of the latitude"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26014"],[0,"Practical Taxidermy (#19)"],[1,"lime or carbolic acid.  The vessel must be afterwards well rinsed out in clean water, as 'the  potassa temporarily stains everything in contact a rich purplish red.    Some experiments which I conducted with benzoline incontestably proved  to me its valuable properties. I experimented on a Cornish chough--an  old specimen, infested with maggots or larvae of the \"clothes\" moth. I  immediately plunged it in benzoline, took it out, drained the  superfluous spirit off, and rapidly dried it by suspending it in a  strong current of air.    It took but a short time to dry, and, though the feathers were very  slightly clotted after the operation, yet, by a little manipulation,  explained hereafter, they soon arrived at their pristine freshness,  and all the insects which previously infested it were effectually  killed. I afterwards found on another specimen--a short-eared owl--two  or three larvae feeding on the feathers. I poured a little benzoline  over them in situ, and they fell off, apparently dead. I kept them for  a day, and by that time they were shrivelled and undeniably dead.    Here, then, we have the two elements of success--a perfect destroyer  of insects, and an agent not damaging, but positively beneficial, to  the feathers of birds when applied; added to which, is the remarkable  cheapness of benzoline. Caution--do not use it near a candle, lamp,  nor fire, as it gives off a highly inflammable vapour at a low  temperature; it also fills a house with a peculiarly disagreeable  odour, finding its way upstairs, as all volatile gases do; so it had  better always be used in the workshop or outhouse.    I have just discovered--and feel very \"small\" that I did not do so  before--that benzoline perfectly preserves birds \"in the flesh\" for a  considerable time. I tried it on a razorbill (Alta torda, 1.), which I  placed in a \"preparation\" jar, filled with common benzoline at 1 s.  per gallon. The bird was simply cut under the wing to allow the  benzoline to penetrate, and was left for three weeks; at the end of  which time it and taken out, cleaned in plaster (as described in  Chapter XI.), and made a most excellent taxidermic object! The  advantages of this to the overworked professional are obvious.    In very severe cases I have used turpentine (\"turps\") with excellent  effect; in fact, as a destructive agent for insects, I prefer it to  benzoline, having now mastered the hitherto fatal objections to its  use on birds' skins. For the skins of mammals there is nothing to beat  it. This will be enlarged on in the chapter on \"Relaxing and Cleaning  Skins.\"    In thus speaking of benzoline and turpentine as agents in the  destruction of insect plagues, I mean, of course, that the specimens  should be plunged into, or have poured over them either benzoline or  turpentine. This seems to have been lost sight of by some former  correspondents of mine, one of whom writes--\"In your toxicological  section, I do not find any opinion on atmospheric poisoning of acari,  etc.    \"If not giving you too much trouble, I should be glad to know whether  you think spirits of turpentine would be efficacious if allowed to  evaporate in a case of birds in which moths have lately shown  themselves.    \"I am unwilling to have them taken out, in fact they have not been  cased twelve months, and I thought of boring a hole in an obscure  corner with bit and brace, and inserting a saturated sponge, and then  closing it again.    \"Waterton says--'The atmosphere of spirit of turpentine will allow  neither acarus nor any insect to live in it: Do you believe this?\"    My answer to him, and to all such correspondents, was that I had  repeatedly proved that all such little vermin did not care a bit for  the fumes of benzoline, nor of any spirits whatever, as I had caused  gallons of turpentine, etc, to be poured into large cases containing  specimens without producing the smallest effect, unless it absolutely  touched them, but that I had partly succeeded by introducing cyanide  of potassium (deadly poison) into small cases containing birds,  through a hole bored for the purpose; but it was objectionable:    (I) on the score of its danger to health, should the poisonous vapour  escape; and    (2) because it deliquesced rapidly in any but the driest atmosphere,  by its affinity for damp, and, consequently, often caused mildew in  cases of birds, etc, into which it had been introduced. The fumes of  sulphur during combustion are, on the contrary, really of service in  destroying insect life, as evidenced in the fumigation of hospital  wards, etc, but I cannot tell how anyone may burn sulphur in specimen  cases without half choking himself, and probably setting on fire the  fittings and spoiling the work altogether. It is also objectionable  because it readily discharges certain colours from fabrics, flowers,  and birds' feathers. My advice is, therefore, to pull to pieces any  case infested with insects, to burn all fittings not absolutely  valuable, and to drench with turpentine all specimens, together with  all the rockwork and fittings desired to be retained. [Footnote: I  would indeed advise the destruction by burning of the birds themselves  even, should they be common specimens, or easily replaced.]    Crude creosote, in little pots or saucers, is a great deterrent to the  visits of insect plagues; it cannot, however, be exposed openly, as  its scent is overpowering and decidedly unhealthy for use in private  houses. In museums it does very well if cased up.    With regard to camphor in museums, although it is so constantly used,  I consider it of no use as a deterrent. A small piece of tallow  candle is equally efficacious, and of late I have had much more faith  in insect powders, the best of which is, I believe, compounded of the  petals of the Russian tansy (Pyrethrum roseum). This has certainly  some principle contained in it not obvious to our senses. It is  perfectly harmless to man, and to domestic animals, but on insects its  action is entirely different. I cannot as yet discover whether insects  eat it, or if its smell overcomes them, whether it repels, or attracts  them to their doom. A series of experiments has left me just as much  in the dark as ever. Certain it is that I have never found insects  among skins over which it has been strewn.    There is, however, one slight objection to its use, which is that it  stains light-coloured skins, if at all greasy, with its fine,  brownish-yellow dust. This is, however, but a trifle, easily avoided,  in face of its unquestionable value. I have used it now for many  years, and have never had cause to alter my opinion as to its  efficacy. The best only must be procured, from some well-known  wholesale house, price about 3s. per lb. That sold made up in small  quantities is generally adulterated and useless. No curator should  ever be without it, and a small quantity should always be placed  inside a newly-made skin. It can also be worked up in many of the  preservative pastes, or macerated in spirit as a wash, for the inside  of skins.    Baking or stowing maggot-infected specimens is recommended by some  authors, but I strongly object to it in the case of old or valuable  skins, firstly, because the heat can seldom be properly regulated,  unless in an apparatus specially constructed; secondly, because heat  sufficient to kill the larvae is also sufficient to crimp or twist  some part of the plumage or render the skin, if an old specimen, too  crisp or tender for ultimate handling; thirdly, because even a  moderate degree of heat is sufficient to set free the fat contained in  the skin, and thus spoil the feathers.    Perhaps the tyro may remark, \"But in a preserved and stuffed skin  there ought to be no fat to ooze out.\" Quite true, there ought not to  be, but as skins are usually dressed with arsenical soap, the fat,  instead of being dried up, is beautifully conserved, ready to run out  at the slightest provocation, or be drawn out by the capillary  attraction of the threads used in sewing up--another hard knock for  arsenical pastes!    Writing about pastes reminds me that no taxidermist should be without  a pot of flour paste, which is far better and more cleanly than gum or  glue for sticking in loose feathers, etc. For a small quantity,  sufficient to fill a jam-pot, take    No. 31.--Flour Paste.    Good wheat flour,     2 oz.    Essence of cloves,     0.5 a teaspoonful.    Water,             0.5 pint.    Mix the flour with part of the water in a basin, being careful to  crush out all the lumps, and work it up smoothly to the consistence of  thick cream; add the remainder of the water, and boil for a few  minutes in a saucepan. Turn out into a jam-pot, and when nearly cold  stir in the essence of cloves; this latter gives an agreeable odour to  the paste, is not poisonous, and preserves the paste indefinitely from  turning mouldy. A few drops of carbolic acid may be used instead of  the cloves; but in this case the pot must be labelled \"Poison.\"    Strong gum water may be made from gum arabic, into which a little  powdered white sugar is stirred. Essence of cloves prevents mould in  this also, unless there be an excess of water.    A fine paste, useful for paper or photographic work, is made from  rice-flour.    \"Dextrine,\" in powder, is cheap and strong, easily soluble in cold  water, but as a paste shows up on feathers, etc, much more than  wheat-flour paste.    Cement, for uniting broken bones or fossils, or to fix shells, etc, on  tablets, is, says the late Frank Buckland, made thus    No. 32.--White Cement.    Beeswax,                         1 part.    Powdered plaster of Paris (best fine),     5 parts.    Resin,                         4 parts.    Warm the edges (when possible) and use the cement warm.    I would advise the plaster being stirred into the other two  ingredients as wanted. The great objection to this and to all the  \"coagulines\" is that the edges of the "]]]
