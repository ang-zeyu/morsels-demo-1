No person who undertakes to investigate the origin of the human family  and the mutual relations of its different members, can afford to be  without this work. Published in Stuttgart.           *       *       *       *       *    BERTHOLD AUERBACH has just brought out a little volume of tales, which  we may well infer from his previous performances are charmingly replete  with grace, good humor, and a keen perception of whatever is peculiar to  his subject. The title of the book is _Deutsche Abende_ (German  Evenings). It contains three stories: \"Nice People,\" \"What is  Happiness?\" and \"The Son of the Forester.\" Published at Mannheim.           *       *       *       *       *    BARON STERNBERG, a dilettante book-maker of Germany, who generally  resides at Berlin, has just added a new romance, or rather the beginning  of one, to his previous publications. It bears the promising, if not  pretentious title, of _The German Gil Blas_ (published at Bremen), and  claims to be comic, as a matter of course. As a whole, the book is a  failure. Though there are passages here and there which may be read with  satisfaction, there is not enough unity and connection between the  different parts, and the humor is generally but a thin potation. It must  be said, however, that the absence of continuous interest is the fault  of most comic novels, as well as poems. Even the matchless works of Jean  Paul grow tedious by the endeavor to read much of them at a time, a fact  which may be ascribed to the sentimentality and mere fantastics with  which the kernels of his wit are overburdened. It is certain that no  German humorous work can be compared with those great originals in that  kind, Gil Blas and Don Quixote, or even with the much inferior works of  Smollett and Dickens. Baron Sternberg's last effort forms no exception  to this remark, and there is little hope that the second and concluding  volume, whose appearance in Germany ought to be made by this time, will  prove superior to the first. His \"Royalists,\" an anti-democratic novel,  which he had the courage to publish in the chaos of 1848, and which  excited much attention, and a great deal of severe criticism, was far  better.           *       *       *       *       *    \"THE NEW FAITH SOUGHT IN ART,\" is the title of an anonymous little book  lately issued at Paris, which, though not of great value, has more  poetic originality of thought than is often found in printed pages. The  author thinks that the time has gone by in which the subjects of art  could properly be sought in the lives of saints and legends of the  Church, and wishes to substitute for them the lives of artists and  celebrated inventors, who have sprung from the bosom of the people. With  this writer, every thing is democratic and popular. For him the people  is alone King, and worthy of all honor. \"Nothing,\" he says in one place,  \"is truer than the song of Beethoven. It is the song of life, the voice  of truth, an infallible voice, which will create a world, and cause the  old false world to crumble. Born of the people, the people sing in him,  although they know him not.\" In painting, the heroes of the author are  Ruysdael, Rembrandt, Claude-Lorraine, and Paul Potter.           *       *       *       *       *    The Poet FREILIGRATH has received orders to leave the village of Bilk,  in the neighborhood of Dusseldorf; where he was residing, and to quit  the Prussian territories. He will probably go back to England, where he  passed some time in a counting-house or perhaps come to the United  States, where he has several friends, to whom he has written of such an  event as possible.           *       *       *       *       *    In AFRICAN DISCOVERY greater advances have been made in the last two  years than before since the journeys of the brothers Lander. We  mentioned in the last _International_ that the American traveller, Dr.  W. Mathews, had been heard of at Vienna, and we now learn that he has  been very successful in the five years of his adventure in the northern  and central parts of the continent. Letters received in Berlin from Drs.  Barth and Overweg, contain information of their having accomplished the  journey across the Great Desert, or Sahara, and of their arrival near  the frontiers of the kingdom of Air or Asben, (Air is the modern  Tuarick, and Asben the ancient Sudan name), the most powerful in that  part of Africa after Bornou, and never explored by Europeans. On the  24th of August--the date of their last letter--they were at Taradshit, a  small place in about 20 deg. 30' N. latitude, and 9 deg. 20' longitude E. of  Greenwich. Among their discoveries are some of peculiar interest, one of  which is of several curious and very ancient sculptures, apparently of  Egyptian origin. The King of Prussia has, at the instance of the  Chevalier Bunsen and Baron Alexander von Humboldt, augmented the funds  of the two travellers by a grant of 1,000 thalers.    While Richardson, Barth and Overweg have penetrated the _terra  incognita_ of the north, Dr. Krapf and the Rev. Mr. Rebmann have  explored the region described on the common maps as the \"Great Southern  Sahara,\" and found it to be fertile, healthy, abounding in mountains,  valleys and rivers, and inhabited by a race altogether superior to that  which occupies the Atlantic coast. Mr. Mansfield Parkyns is endeavoring  to cross the country southward from the Nile to the river Gambia; Mr.  Charles Johnson is travelling in Abysinnia; Baron von Mueller is  conducting an expedition up the White Nile; and the American  missionaries and colonists are gradually extending their knowledge over  the various settlements on the eastern coast of the continent.           *       *       *       *       *    THE PRUSSIAN EXPEDITION TO EGYPT, _Denkmaeler aus AEgypten und AEthiopien  nach den Zeichnungen der von Sr. Majestat dem Koenige von Preussen  Friedrich Wilhelm IV. nach diesen Laendern gesendeten, und in den Jahren  1842-45, ausgefuhrten wissenschaftlichen Expedition: Herausgegeben von  Dr. R. Lepsius_; published at the expense and under the guarantee of the  Prussian Government, will be completed in eighty parts, or eight hundred  plates. Most of the plates are printed with tints, and many in the  colors of the originals. This work forms a necessary completion of the  celebrated work of the French Expedition under Napoleon. Parts I. to X.  are now advertised as ready for subscribers, in London, at three dollars  and a half each.           *       *       *       *       *    A NEW WORK ON AFRICA, by H. C. Grund, is advertised at Berlin.           *       *       *       *       *    Almanacs for popular use, offer a means much used in France for the  propagation of political, social and religious doctrines. Every sect and  party issues its Almanac, and some issue several, crammed to the brim  with the peculiar notions whose dissemination is wished for. One of the  most successful for the year 1851, is the _Almanach des Opprimes_ (The  Almanac of the Oppressed). In fact, it is aimed wholly at the Society of  Jesuits, whose history it exposes in the blackest colors. It begins with  the early life of Loyola, depicts his debaucheries, his ambition, the  religious mechanism invented by his enthusiastic and fanatical genius,  the flexibility of his morality, and goes on to give an account of the  intrigues and crimes of his successors in various countries and times,  with an analysis of their books, their missions and their miracles.  Another of these publications is called the _Almanach du Peuple_,  containing a very great variety of articles of substantial value. Among  the contributors are, F. Arago, Quinet, Charras, Carnot, Girardin,  George Sand, Pierre Leroux, Dumil Aeur, E. Lithe, Mazzini, and other  republicans distinguished in the political, literary and scientific  world. This Almanac had the honor last year of being seized by the  Government, but on trial before a jury it was acquitted of the charge  against it, of being dangerous to society, and provoking citizens to  hate the republic and despise the authorities.           *       *       *       *       *    A critic in the _Allegemeine Zeitung_, in noticing \"Ottomar, a Romance  from the Present Time,\" the last novel from the pen of Madame Von  Zoellner, takes occasion to give some hard hits at women's novels in  general. \"It always must and always will be a failure,\" he says, \"when a  woman attempts to form a just conception of masculine character, and to  put her conception into language. Female writers always comb out  smoothly the flaxen hair of their heroes, and dress them up in the  frockcoat of innocence. They go into raptures over a sort of green  enthusiasm, and a romantic fantasticality of virtue, such as we godless  fellows are not guilty of possessing; and in this way they turn out  automatons which resemble nothing in earth, heaven, or elsewhere.\" The  critic however admits that Madame Zoellner, who is undoubtedly one of the  best living German novel writers, possesses remarkable and peculiar  merits. No other woman occupies so high a place with the German public,  except it be Fanny Lewald. Madame Zoellner is praised for the pure moral  tone of her writings.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the most accomplished writers in France--M. DE CORMENIN--and one  of the most _spirituel_ of that _spirituel_ nation, said at Frankfort,  \"It is true that it is difficult to abolish war, but it is far more  difficult to abolish death; and yet if people would take the same pains  to avoid the one as they did to escape the other, they would certainly  accomplish their object.\"           *       *       *       *       *    One of the most ardent and vigorous writers of Young France, Alphonse  Esquiros,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/227"],[0,"Aeneidos (#19)"],[1,"matres, populumque volentem    deponunt, animos nil magnae laudis egentes.    Ipsi transtra novant, flammisque ambesa reponunt    robora navigiis, aptant remosque rudentesque,    exigui numero, sed bello vivida virtus.    Interea Aeneas urbem designat aratro    sortiturque domos; hoc Ilium et haec loca Troiam    esse iubet.  Gaudet regno Troianus Acestes,    indicitque forum et patribus dat iura vocatis.    Tum vicina astris, Erycino in vertice sedes    fundatur Veneri Idaliae, tumuloque sacerdos    ac lucus late sacer additur Anchiseo.      Iamque dies epulata novem gens omnis, et aris    factus honos:  placidi straverunt aequora venti,    creber et adspirans rursus vocat Auster in altum.    Exoritur procurva ingens per litora fletus;    complexi inter se noctemque diemque morantur.    Ipsae iam matres, ipsi, quibus aspera quondam    visa maris facies et non tolerabile nomen,    ire volunt, omnemque fugae perferre laborem.    Quos bonus Aeneas dictis solatur amicis,    et consanguineo lacrimans commendat Acestae.    Tris Eryci vitulos et Tempestatibus agnam    caedere deinde iubet, solvique ex ordine funem.    Ipse, caput tonsae foliis evinctus olivae,    stans procul in prora pateram tenet, extaque salsos    proiicit in fluctus ac vina liquentia fundit.    Prosequitur surgens a puppi ventus euntes.    Certatim socii feriunt mare et aequora verrunt.      At Venus interea Neptunum exercita curis    adloquitur, talesque effundit pectore questus:    Iunonis gravis ira nec exsaturabile pectus    cogunt me, Neptune, preces descendere in omnes;    quam nec longa dies, pietas nec mitigat ulla,    nec Iovis imperio fatisque infracta quiescit.    Non media de gente Phrygum exedisse nefandis    urbem odiis satis est, nec poenam traxe per omnem:    reliquias Troiae, cineres atque ossa peremptae    insequitur:  causas tanti sciat illa furoris.    Ipse mihi nuper Libycis tu testis in undis    quam molem subito excierit:  maria omnia caelo    miscuit, Aeoliis nequiquam freta procellis,    in regnis hoc ausa tuis.    Per scelus ecce etiam Troianis matribus actis    exussit foede puppes, et classe subegit    amissa socios ignotae linquere terrae.    Quod superest, oro, liceat dare tuta per undas    vela tibi, liceat Laurentem attingere Thybrim:    si concessa peto, si dant ea moenia Parcae.'    Tum Saturnius haec domitor maris edidit alti:    'Fas omne est, Cytherea, meis te fidere regnis,    unde genus ducis:  merui quoque; saepe furores    compressi, et rabiem tantam caelique marisque.    Nec minor in terris, Xanthum Simoentaque testor,    Aeneae mihi cura tui.  Cum Troia Achilles    exanimata sequens impingeret agmina muris,    milia multa daret leto, gemerentque repleti    amnes, nec reperire viam atque evolvere posset    in mare se Xanthus, Pelidae tunc ego forti    congressum Aenean nec dis nec viribus aequis    nube cava rapui, cuperem cum vertere ab imo    structa meis manibus periurae moenia Troiae.    Nunc quoque mens eadem perstat mihi:  pelle timores.    Tutus, quos optas, portus accedet Averni.    Unus erit tantum, amissum quem gurgite quaeres;    unum pro multis dabitur caput.'    His ubi laeta deae permulsit pectora dictis,    iungit equos auro genitor, spumantiaque addit    frena feris, manibusque omnes effundit habenas.    Caeruleo per summa levis volat aequora curru;    subsidunt undae, tumidumque sub axe tonanti    sternitur aequor aquis; fugiunt vasto aethere nimbi.    Tum variae comitum facies, immania cete,    et senior Glauci chorus, Inousque Palaemon,    Tritonesque citi, Phorcique exercitus omnis;    laeva tenent Thetis, et Melite, Panopeaque virgo,    Nisaee, Spioque, Thaliaque, Cymodoceque.      Hic patris Aeneae suspensam blanda vicissim    gaudia pertemptant mentem:  iubet ocius omnes    attolli malos, intendi brachia velis.    Una omnes fecere pedem pariterque sinistros,    nunc dextros solvere sinus; una ardua torquent    cornua detorquentque; ferunt sua flamina classem.    Princeps ante omnes densum Palinurus agebat    agmen; ad hunc alii cursum contendere iussi.    Iamque fere mediam caeli Nox humida metam    contigerat; placida laxabant membra quiete    sub remis fusi per dura sedilia nautae:    cum levis aetheriis delapsus Somnus ab astris    aera dimovit tenebrosum et dispulit umbras,    te, Palinure, petens, tibi somnia tristia portans    insonti; puppique deus consedit in alta,    Phorbanti similis, funditque has ore loquelas:    'Iaside Palinure, ferunt ipsa aequora classem;    aequatae spirant aurae; datur hora quieti.    Pone caput, fessosque oculos furare labori:    ipse ego paulisper pro te tua munera inibo.'    Cui vix attollens Palinurus lumina fatur:    'Mene salis placidi voltum fluctusque quietos    ignorare iubes?  Mene huic confidere monstro?    Aenean credam quid enim fallacibus auris    et caelo, totiens deceptus fraude sereni?'    Talia dicta dabat, clavumque affixus et haerens    nusquam amittebat, oculosque sub astra tenebat.    Ecce deus ramum Lethaeo rore madentem,    vique soporatum Stygia, super utraque quassat    tempora, cunctantique natantia lumina solvit.    Vix primos inopina quies laxaverat artus,    et super incumbens cum puppis parte revolsa,    cumque gubernaclo, liquidas proiecit in undas    praecipitem ac socios nequiquam saepe vocantem;    ipse volans tenues se sustulit ales ad auras.    Currit iter tutum non secius aequore classis,    promissisque patris Neptuni interrita fertur.    Iamque adeo scopulos Sirenum advecta subibat,    difficiles quondam multorumque ossibus albos,    tum rauca adsiduo longe sale saxa sonabant:    cum pater amisso fluitantem errare magistro    sensit, et ipse ratem nocturnis rexit in undis,    multa gemens, casuque animum concussus amici    'O nimium caelo et pelago confise sereno,    nudus in ignota, Palinure, iacebis harena!'            PUBLI VERGILI MARONIS      AENEIDOS      LIBER VI      SIC fatur lacrimans, classique immittit habenas,    et tandem Euboicis Cumarum adlabitur oris.    Obvertunt pelago proras; tum dente tenaci    ancora fundabat naves, et litora curvae    praetexunt puppes.  Iuvenum manus emicat ardens    litus in Hesperium; quaerit pars semina flammae    abstrusa in venis silicis, pars densa ferarum    tecta rapit silvas, inventaque flumina monstrat.    At pius Aeneas arces, quibus altus Apollo    praesidet, horrendaeque procul secreta Sibyllae    antrum immane petit, magnum cui mentem animumque    Delius inspirat vates, aperitque futura.    Iam subeunt Triviae lucos atque aurea tecta.      Daedalus, ut fama est, fugiens Minoia regna,    praepetibus pennis ausus se credere caelo,    insuetum per iter gelidas enavit ad Arctos,    Chalcidicaque levis tandem super adstitit arce.    Redditus his primum terris, tibi, Phoebe, sacravit    remigium alarum, posuitque immania templa.    In foribus letum Androgeo:  tum pendere poenas    Cecropidae iussi---miserum!---septena quotannis    corpora natorum; stat ductis sortibus urna.    Contra elata mari respondet Gnosia tellus:    hic crudelis amor tauri, suppostaque furto    Pasiphae, mixtumque genus prolesque biformis    Minotaurus inest, Veneris monumenta nefandae;    hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error;    magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem    Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resolvit,    caeca regens filo vestigia.  Tu quoque magnam    partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare, haberes.    Bis conatus erat casus effingere in auro;    bis patriae cecidere manus.  Quin protinus omnia    perlegerent oculis, ni iam praemissus Achates    adforet, atque una Phoebi Triviaeque sacerdos,    Deiphobe Glauci, fatur quae talia regi:    'Non hoc ista sibi tempus spectacula poscit;    nunc grege de intacto septem mactare iuvencos    praestiterit, totidem lectas de more bidentes.'    Talibus adfata Aenean (nec sacra morantur    iussa viri), Teucros vocat alta in templa sacerdos.      Excisum Euboicae latus ingens rupis in antrum,    quo lati ducunt aditus centum, ostia centum;    unde ruunt totidem voces, responsa Sibyllae.    Ventum erat ad limen, cum virgo.  'Poscere fata    tempus' ait; 'deus, ecce, deus!' Cui talia fanti    ante fores subito non voltus, non color unus,    non comptae mansere comae; sed pectus anhelum,    et rabie fera corda tument; maiorque videri,    nec mortale sonans, adflata est numine quando    iam propiore dei.  'Cessas in vota precesque,    Tros' ait 'Aenea?  Cessas?  Neque enim ante dehiscent    attonitae magna ora domus.'  Et talia fata    conticuit.  Gelidus Teucris per dura cucurrit    ossa tremor, funditque preces rex pectore ab imo:    'Phoebe, graves Troiae semper miserate labores,    Dardana qui Paridis direxti tela manusque    corpus in Aeacidae, magnas obeuntia terras    tot maria intravi duce te, penitusque repostas    Massylum gentes praetentaque Syrtibus arva,    iam tandem Italiae fugientis prendimus oras;    hac Troiana tenus fuerit Fortuna secuta.    Vos quoque Pergameae iam fas est parcere genti,    dique deaeque omnes quibus obstitit Ilium et ingens    gloria Dardaniae.  Tuque, O sanctissima vates,    praescia venturi, da, non indebita posco    regna meis fatis, Latio considere Teucros    errantisque deos agitataque numina Troiae.    Tum Phoebo et Triviae solido de marmore templum    instituam, festosque dies de nomine Phoebi.    Te quoque magna manent regnis penetralia nostris:    hic ego namque tuas sortes arcanaque fata,    dicta meae genti, ponam, lectosque sacrabo,    alma, viros.  Foliis tantum ne carmina manda,    ne turbata volent rapidis ludibria ventis;    ipsa canas oro.'  Finem dedit ore loquendi.      At, Phoebi nondum patiens, immanis in antro    bacchatur vates, magnum si pectore possit    excussisse deum; tanto magis ille fatigat    os rabidum, fera corda domans, fingitque premendo.    Ostia iamque domus patuere ingentia centum    sponte sua, vatisque ferunt responsa per auras:    'O tandem magnis pelagi defuncte periclis!    Sed terrae graviora manent.
