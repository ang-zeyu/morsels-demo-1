In 1782, John Alder, then a child of eight years, was captured in Wythe  County, Virginia, by a party of Min-goes, who at the same time wounded  and killed his brother. They already had two prisoners, Mrs. Martin, the  wife of a neighbor, and her little one four or five years old: it proved  troublesome, on their rapid march across the Ohio country to their  village on Mad River, and they tomahawked and scalped it. The next  morning little Alder was somewhat slow in rising from his breakfast  when bidden, and on the ground he saw the shadow of an arm with a lifted  tomahawk. He glanced upward and found an Indian standing over him,  who presently began to feel of Alder's thick black hair. He afterwards  confessed that he had been about to kill him, but when he met his  pleasant smile he could not strike, and then he thought that a boy with  hair of that color would make a good Indian, and so spared him.    At the Mingo village Alder was made to run the gantlet between lines of  children armed with switches, but he was not much hurt, and he was now  taken into the tribe. He was given to a Mingo family, and the mother  washed him and dressed him in the Indian costume. They were kind to  him, but for a month he was very homesick, and used to go every day to a  large walnut tree near the town and cry for the friends and home he had  lost. After he had learned the Mingo language he began in time to be  more contented. He had no complaint to make of any of the family, except  one sister, who despised him as a prisoner, and treated him like a  slave. Another sister and her husband were his special friends, and he  relates that when he used to sit up with the Indians round their camp  fire, listening to their stories, he would sometimes drowse; then this  gentle sister and her husband would take him up in their arms and carry  him to bed, and he would hear them saying, \"Poor fellow! We have sat up  too long for him, and he has fallen asleep on the cold ground.\"    About a year after he was adopted, Alder met that poor mother, whose  little one the Indians had cruelly murdered before her eyes. \"When she  saw me, she came smiling, and asked if it was me. I told her it was. She  asked me how I had been. I told her I had been very unwell, for I had  had fever and ague for a long time. So she took me off to a log, and  there we sat down; and she combed my head, and asked a great many  questions about how I lived, and if I didn't want to see my mother and  little brothers. I told her I should be glad to see them, but never  expected to see them again. We took many a cry together, and when we  parted, took our last and final farewell, for I never saw her again.\"    Alder always remained delicate, and could not thrive on the Indians'  fare of meat and hominy, with no bread or salt; of sugar and honey there  was plenty; but he missed the things he was used to at home. When he  grew older he was given a gun, and sent hunting, and whenever he came  back with game the Indians praised his skill and promised him he should  be a great hunter some day. He continued with them until the peace of  1795, which followed Wayne's victory, and even then he stayed for a time  in the region where he had dwelt so long. He had married a squaw,  and had become a complete Indian, so that the first settlers in his  neighborhood had to teach him to speak English. But he did not live  happily with his Indian wife; they agreed to part, and then Alder  thought of going back to his own people. He reached the house of one of  his brothers in the neighborhood of his old home, one Sunday afternoon,  and found several of his brothers and sisters there, and his mother with  them. They could scarcely be persuaded that it was their son and brother  come back to them, and he had to tell them of some things that no one  else could know before they would believe him. His old, white-haired  mother whom he remembered in her youth with a \"head as black as a crow,\"  was the first to take him in her arms, and she said, as she wept over  him, \"How you have grown! I dreamed that you had come to see me, but  you was a little _ornary_-looking fellow, and I would not own you for my  son; but now I find I was mistaken, that it is entirely the reverse, and  I am proud to own you for my son.\"    [Illustration: Alder returns to his Family 141]    In 1792, Moses Hewit was taken near Neil's Station, on the Little  Kanawha, by three Indians, who at once pushed off with him towards  Sandusky. They used him very kindly, and shared fully with him the wild  honey which they found in the bee trees, and invited him to take part in  their foot races and other sports. He found that he could outrun two of  them, and he resolved to try for his liberty, though he kept a cheerful  outside with them, and seemed contented with his lot. One day they left  him tied hand and foot and fastened to two small trees while they went  on a hunt, but he contrived to free himself, and made his escape with  their whole stock of provisions, two small pieces of venison. He struck  out for the settlements on the Muskingum, and the first night his  captors passed so near him in pursuit that he might have touched them  in the darkness. Nine days later he came in sight of a station on the  Muskingum, so spent with hunger and fatigue that he could not halloo to  the garrison. He had nothing on his wasted and bleeding body, which was  all torn by briers and brushwood, except a cloth about his loins, and  he was afraid of being mistaken and shot for an Indian. He waited till  nightfall and then crept to the station, where his presence was unknown  till a young man of his acquaintance caught sight of his face in the  firelight, and called out, \"Here is 'Hewit!\"    Captain Charles Builderback and his wife were surprised by a party of  Indians while they were looking for cattle in the Ohio country, near  Wheeling, in 1789. Mrs. Builderback hid herself, but the Indians had  captured her husband, and now they forced him to call out to her. She  hesitated to answer, thinking of the children they had left at home in  the cabin which she could see across the river, and knowing how useless  it would be to give herself up. But he called again, saying that if she  surrendered, it might save his life. Then she showed herself, and  was seized and hurried away by one band of savages, while her husband  remained with the others. A few days later these came up and showed her  his scalp: he was one of the assassins of the Gnadenhiitten Indians,  and he was doomed as soon as they knew his name. She was taken to their  towns on the Great Miami, where she lived nine months, drudging with the  squaws and suffering from the rude and filthy life of the savages, but  not ill-treated. Then the commandant at Cincinnati ransomed her and sent  her home to her two orphan children.    So lately as 1812 two little girls were stolen from their fathers'  houses in Preble County by the Indians. They could not be traced, but  twenty-five years later, one of them, named Parker, was found living  with her savage husband in Indiana. She refused then to go home with her  father, saying coldly that she should be ridiculed there for her Indian  customs.          XV. INDIAN HEROES AND SAGES.    The Ohio Indians were of almost as mixed origin as the white people  of Ohio, and if they had qualities beyond those of any other group of  American savages, it was from much the same causes which have given the  Ohioans of our day distinction as citizens. They made the Ohio country  their home by a series of chances, and they defended it against the  French, the English, and Americans in turn, because it had bounds which  seemed to form the natural frontier between them and the Europeans.    It is now believed that before the coming of our race there was a  balance of power between those two great North American nations, the  Iroquois and the Algonquins, and that our wars and intrigues destroyed  this balance, which was never restored, and put an end to all hope of  advance in the native race. Whether this is true or not, it is certain  that the hostilities between the tribes raged down to our day, and  that these seem to have continued if not begun through one family, the  Algonquins, siding with the French, and the other family, the Iroquois,  siding with the English. The Algonquins were most powerful in New  England and Canada, and the Iroquois in New York. Their struggle ended  in the overthrow of the Algonquins in the regions bordering on the  English colonies, where, as has been told, a great branch of that  people who called themselves the Lenni-lenape, and whom we called the  Delawares, dwelt in a sort of vassalage to the Iroquois.    In Ohio, however, these families, so long broken elsewhere by their  feuds, united in a common fear and hate of the white men. Many of the  Ohio Indians were Delawares, but the Miamis were Iroquois, while the  Wyandots again were Hurons, one of the finest and ablest of the Iroquois  nation. They ceased to make war upon each other, and in their union the  strongest traits of both were blended. Their character appears at its'  best, I think, in Tecaughretanego, the adoptive brother of James Smith,  and in the great Mingo chief, Logan.    Of Tecaughretanego, his unselfishness, his piety, his common sense, his  wisdom, we already know something from Smith's narrative, which I wish  every boy and girl might read; and of Logan's noble spirit we have had  a glimpse in the story of Kenton's captivity. He was the son of  Shikellimy, a Cayuga chief who lived at Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and who  named him after James Logan, the Secretary of the Province. Shikellimy  was a convert of the Moravian preachers, and it is thought that Logan  himself was baptized in the Christian faith. He spent the greater  portion of his early life in Pennsylvania, and he took no part in the  war between the French and English, except to do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],[0,"Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#19)"],[1,"y, poor Mr Toole grew worse.    Escaping several dangers, they returned to Angala, where at first the  major hoped his poor friend might recover, but on the 26th of February a  cold shiver seized him, and just before noon he expired, completely  worn-out and exhausted.  He had scarcely completed his 22nd year, and  was in every sense an amiable and promising young officer.    On Denham's return to Kouka, he found the sheikh with a large army  collected to attack the Begharmis, who were scouring the country.  As,  however, he was suffering from fever, he went on to Kouka, where he  heard of the death of Dr Oudney at a place called Murmur.  The sheikh's  expedition was successful, and the people were highly delighted with the  plunder which had been obtained.    Sickness, however, was at work in the city.  Omar, an Arab, who had  arrived with Mr Toole, died, and Columbus caught the fever, and had to  take to his bed.  The major, however, was cheered by the arrival of Mr  Tyrhwit, who had been sent out by the British Government to strengthen  the party.  He brought a present of two swords, two brace of pistols, a  dagger, and two gold watches, which were received by El Kanemy with  great delight.  On hearing that some rockets had also been forwarded, he  exclaimed: \"What besides all these riches!  There are no friends like  these; they are all true; and I see by the book that, if the prophet had  lived only a short time longer, they would have become Moslem.\"    On the termination of the Rhamadan, June 1st, the sheikh again took the  field, proceeding eastward along the shores of the Chad, against a  powerful Biddomah chief, called Amanook, who held a strong position on  some islands near the shores of the lake.  The object of the expedition  had been kept a great secret till the neighbourhood of the country to be  attacked was reached.  The army marched through the country of the  Shooas, a people who live entirely in tents of leather and huts of  rushes, changing but from necessity, on the approach of an enemy or want  of pasturage for their numerous flocks.  They seldom fight, except in  their own defence.  Their principal food is the milk of camels, in which  they are rich, and also that of cows and sheep; often they take no other  nourishment for months together.  They have the greatest contempt for  and hatred of the negro nations, and yet are always tributary either to  one black sultan or another.  There is no example of their ever having  peopled a town or established themselves in a permanent home.    The sheikh having halted the main body of his army, Barca Gana advanced  with a thousand men, being joined also by four hundred Dugganahs.  They  found the chief, Amanook, posted, with all his cattle and people, on a  narrow pass between two lakes, having in front of him a lake which was  neither deep nor wide, but full of holes, with a deceitful, muddy  bottom.    The sheikh's troops had long been without food, and the sight of the  bleating flocks and lowing herds was too much for them.  Barca Gana,  however, seeing the strength of the enemy's position, wished to halt,  and to send over spearmen on foot, with shields, who would lead the  attack.  The younger chiefs however exclaimed: \"What! be so near them as  this, and not eat them?  No, let us on: this night their flocks and  women will be ours!\"  In this cry the Shooas also joined.  The general  yielded, and the attack commenced.  The Arabs led the way with the  Dugganahs.  On arriving in the middle of the lake the horses sunk up to  their saddle-bows; most of them were out of their depth, and others  floundering in the mud; the ammunition of the riders became wet, their  guns useless.  As they neared the shore, Amanook's men hurled at them  with unerring aim a volley of their light spears, charging with their  strongest and best horses, trained and accustomed to the water, while at  the same time another body, having crossed the lake higher up, came by  the narrow pass and cut off the retreat of all those who had advanced  into the lake.  The sheikh's people now fell thickly.  Barca Gana,  although attacking against his own judgment, was among the foremost, and  received a severe spear-wound in his back, which pierced through four  _tobes_ and his iron chain armour, while attacked by five chiefs, who  seemed determined on finishing him.  One of these he thrust through with  his long spear, and his own people coming to his rescue with a fresh  horse, he was saved, though thirty of his followers were either killed  or captured by Amanook's people.    It was expected that Amanook would attack the camp, but, instead of so  doing, he sent word that he would treat with the sheikh, and that he  wished for peace.  If peace was not to be obtained, however, he swore by  the Prophet that he would turn fish, and fly to the centre of the water;  and, should even the sheikh himself come, he would bring the _wady_  against him.    The major and his companions visited the general, whom they found  suffering much from his wound, but Denham acting as surgeon, it in a  short time healed.  Barca Gana then strongly advised him to return to  Kouka, showing that his hopes of getting to the east would certainly be  disappointed.    A little sheikh, who had arrived from Fezzan, endeavoured to poison the  mind of El Kanemy against the English, telling him that they had  conquered India and probably fully intended to attack Bornou.    On the major's return to Kouka he found that Captain Clapperton had just  returned from Soudan.  On going to the hut where he was lodged, Denham  did not know his friend as he lay extended on the floor, so great was  the alteration in him; and he was about to leave the place, when  Clapperton called out his name.  Notwithstanding this, so great were  Clapperton's spirits, that he spoke of returning to Soudan after the  rains.  He had performed a very interesting journey, the particulars of  which will shortly be narrated.    The sheikh had just before made himself very unpopular with the female  portion of his subjects, having, in consequence of his determination to  improve the morality of his people, issued an order such as the most  savage of despots have never ventured to enact.  One morning the gates  of the city were kept closed at daylight, and sixty women who had a bad  reputation were brought before him.  Five were sentenced to be hanged in  the public market, and four flogged.  Two of the latter expired under  the lash, while the former were dragged, with their heads shaved,  through the market, with ropes round their necks, and were then  strangled and thrown by twos into a hole previously prepared.    The effect on the people was such that a hundred families quitted Kouka  to take up their abode in other towns, where this rigour did not exist.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    CLAPPERTON'S JOURNEY TO SOUDAN.    EXPEDITION OF CLAPPERTON AND OUDNEY TO SOUDAN--BEAUTY OF THE WOMEN--  CRUELTY OF THE ARABS--DR. OUDNEY PRESCRIBES FOR THE SICK--REACH  KATAGUM--SLAVES OFFERED AS PRESENTS--DEATH OF DR.

It will be remembered that Captain Clapperton, accompanied by Dr  Oudney, set out from Kouka on the 14th of December, 1823, for the  purpose of exploring Soudan.  Their party consisted of Jacob, a Jew, two  servants, and three men of Fezzan.  They had three saddle-horses and  four sumpter mules.  They travelled in company with a _kafila_ in which  were twenty-seven Arab merchants and about fifty natives of Bornou.  Most of the Arabs rode on horseback, some having, besides, a led horse,  but all the rest of the party were on foot.    Doctor Oudney was of great service to the _hadji_, who had injured his  hand by the bursting of a gun.  He invariably pitched his tent close to  that of the doctor, who regularly dressed it for him.    Passing old Birnie, they had after two days to pass through an  undulating country, frequently wading across hollows filled with water.  Having to cross a river, the _hadji_ had provided himself with a large  raft, on which his own and his friends' baggage was carried across; but  the Arabs, who passed lower down the river, were dreadfully frightened.  The greatest difficulty was with the camels and female slaves, the women  screaming and squalling loudly.  The camels were towed across, one man  swimming before with a halter in his teeth, while another kept beating  the animal behind with a stick, while it every now and then attempted to  turn back, or bobbed its head under water.    The next day they were exposed to another danger.  The grass having been  set on fire, the flames advanced rapidly, and must have put them all to  flight, had they not sought shelter within the ruined walls of old  Birnie.    They passed through numerous towns and villages, the people belonging to  a tribe of Shooa Arabs.  The women were really beautiful.  They wore  their hair in a form which at a distance might be mistaken for a helmet,  a large braid at the crown having some resemblance to a crest.    They had now to pass through a country inhabited by Bedites, who had not  embraced Islamism.  Protected by the natural fastnesses of their  country, they were held in dread and abhorrence by all the faithful.  The road lay over very elevated ground, and so low was the temperature  in the morning, that the water in their shallow vessels was crusted with  thin flakes of ice, and the water-skins themselves were frozen as hard  as a board.  The horses and camels stood shivering with cold.  Dr  Oudney also became extremely ill, probably from the low temperature.    They had"]]]
