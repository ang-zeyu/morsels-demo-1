A critic of this age would  have pronounced the house fortelesque in style, except for the  windows, with which it was unusually garnished, and the ornate  finish of the doorways or gates. The western windows were four  in number, the northern only two, all set on the line of the  second story in such manner as to overhang the thoroughfares below.  The gates were the only breaks of wall externally visible in the  first story; and, besides being so thickly riven with iron bolts  as to suggest resistance to battering-rams, they were protected  by cornices of marble, handsomely executed, and of such bold  projection as to assure visitors well informed of the people  that the rich man who resided there was a Sadducee in politics  and creed.    Not long after the young Jew parted from the Roman at the palace  up on the Market-place, he stopped before the western gate of the  house described, and knocked. The wicket (a door hung in one of  the valves of the gate) was opened to admit him. He stepped in  hastily, and failed to acknowledge the low salaam of the porter.    To get an idea of the interior arrangement of the structure,  as well as to see what more befell the youth, we will follow him.    The passage into which he was admitted appeared not unlike a narrow  tunnel with panelled walls and pitted ceiling. There were benches  of stone on both sides, stained and polished by long use. Twelve or  fifteen steps carried him into a court-yard, oblong north and south,  and in every quarter, except the east, bounded by what seemed the  fronts of two-story houses; of which the lower floor was divided  into lewens, while the upper was terraced and defended by strong  balustrading. The servants coming and going along the terraces;  the noise of millstones grinding; the garments fluttering from  ropes stretched from point to point; the chickens and pigeons in  full enjoyment of the place; the goats, cows, donkeys, and horses  stabled in the lewens; a massive trough of water, apparently for  the common use, declared this court appurtenant to the domestic  management of the owner. Eastwardly there was a division wall  broken by another passage-way in all respects like the first one.    Clearing the second passage, the young man entered a second court,  spacious, square, and set with shrubbery and vines, kept fresh and  beautiful by water from a basin erected near a porch on the north  side. The lewens here were high, airy, and shaded by curtains  striped alternate white and red. The arches of the lewens rested  on clustered columns. A flight of steps on the south ascended to  the terraces of the upper story, over which great awnings were  stretched as a defence against the sun. Another stairway reached  from the terraces to the roof, the edge of which, all around the  square, was defined by a sculptured cornice, and a parapet of  burned-clay tiling, sexangular and bright red. In this quarter,  moreover, there was everywhere observable a scrupulous neatness,  which, allowing no dust in the angles, not even a yellow leaf  upon a shrub, contributed quite as much as anything else to the  delightful general effect; insomuch that a visitor, breathing the  sweet air, knew, in advance of introduction, the refinement of the  family he was about calling upon.    A few steps within the second court, the lad turned to the right,  and, choosing a walk through the shrubbery, part of which was in  flower, passed to the stairway, and ascended to the terrace--a  broad pavement of white and brown flags closely laid, and much  worn. Making way under the awning to a doorway on the north side,  he entered an apartment which the dropping of the screen behind  him returned to darkness. Nevertheless, he proceeded, moving over a  tiled floor to a divan, upon which he flung himself, face downwards,  and lay at rest, his forehead upon his crossed arms.    About nightfall a woman came to the door and called; he answered,  and she went in.    \"Supper is over, and it is night. Is not my son hungry?\" she asked.    \"No,\" he replied.    \"Are you sick?\"    \"I am sleepy.\"    \"Your mother has asked for you.\"    \"Where is she?\"    \"In the summer-house on the roof.\"    He stirred himself, and sat up.    \"Very well. Bring me something to eat.\"    \"What do you want?\"    \"What you please, Amrah. I am not sick, but indifferent. Life does  not seem as pleasant as it did this morning. A new ailment, O my  Amrah; and you who know me so well, who never failed me, may think  of the things now that answer for food and medicine. Bring me what  you choose.\"    Amrah's questions, and the voice in which she put them--low,  sympathetic, and solicitous--were significant of an endeared  relation between the two. She laid her hand upon his forehead;  then, as satisfied, went out, saying, \"I will see.\"    After a while she returned, bearing on a wooden platter a bowl of  milk, some thin cakes of white bread broken, a delicate paste of  brayed wheat, a bird broiled, and honey and salt. On one end of  the platter there was a silver goblet full of wine, on the other  a brazen hand-lamp lighted.    The room was then revealed: its walls smoothly plastered; the ceiling  broken by great oaken rafters, brown with rain stains and time; the  floor of small diamond-shaped white and blue tiles, very firm and  enduring; a few stools with legs carved in imitation of the legs  of lions; a divan raised a little above the floor, trimmed with  blue cloth, and partially covered by an immense striped woollen  blanket or shawl--in brief, a Hebrew bedroom.    The same light also gave the woman to view. Drawing a stool to  the divan, she placed the platter upon it, then knelt close  by ready to serve him. Her face was that of a woman of fifty,  dark-skinned, dark-eyed, and at the moment softened by a look  of tenderness almost maternal. A white turban covered her head,  leaving the lobes of the ear exposed, and in them the sign that  settled her condition--an orifice bored by a thick awl. She was  a slave, of Egyptian origin, to whom not even the sacred fiftieth  year could have brought freedom; nor would she have accepted it,  for the boy she was attending was her life. She had nursed him  through babyhood, tended him as a child, and could not break  the service. To her love he could never be a man.    He spoke but once during the meal.    \"You remember, O my Amrah,\" he said, \"the Messala who used to  visit me here days at a time.\"    \"I remember him.\"    \"He went to Rome some years ago, and is now back. I called upon  him to-day.\"    A shudder of disgust seized the lad.    \"I knew something had happened,\" she said, deeply interested.  \"I never liked the Messala. Tell me all.\"    But he fell into musing, and to her repeated inquiries only said,  \"He is much changed, and I shall have nothing more to do with him.\"    When Amrah took the platter away, he also went out, and up from  the terrace to the roof.    The reader is presumed to know somewhat of the uses of the  house-top in the East. In the matter of customs, climate is a  lawgiver everywhere. The Syrian summer day drives the seeker of  comfort into the darkened lewen; night, however, calls him forth  early, and the shadows deepening over the mountain-sides seem veils  dimly covering Circean singers; but they are far off, while the  roof is close by, and raised above the level of the shimmering  plain enough for the visitation of cool airs, and sufficiently  above the trees to allure the stars down closer, down at least into  brighter shining. So the roof became a resort--became playground,  sleeping-chamber, boudoir, rendezvous for the family, place of  music, dance, conversation, reverie, and prayer.    The motive that prompts the decoration, at whatever cost,  of interiors in colder climes suggested to the Oriental the  embellishment of his house-top. The parapet ordered by Moses  became a potter's triumph; above that, later, arose towers,  plain and fantastic; still later, kings and princes crowned  their roofs with summer-houses of marble and gold. When the  Babylonian hung gardens in the air, extravagance could push  the idea no further.    The lad whom we are following walked slowly across the house-top  to a tower built over the northwest corner of the palace. Had he  been a stranger, he might have bestowed a glance upon the structure  as he drew nigh it, and seen all the dimness permitted--a darkened  mass, low, latticed, pillared, and domed. He entered, passing under  a half-raised curtain. The interior was all darkness, except that on  four sides there were arched openings like doorways, through which  the sky, lighted with stars, was visible. In one of the openings,  reclining against a cushion from a divan, he saw the figure of a  woman, indistinct even in white floating drapery. At the sound of  his steps upon the floor, the fan in her hand stopped, glistening  where the starlight struck the jewels with which it was sprinkled,  and she sat up, and called his name.    \"Judah, my son!\"    \"It is I, mother,\" he answered, quickening his approach.    Going to her, he knelt, and she put her arms around him, and with  kisses pressed him to her bosom.          CHAPTER IV      The mother resumed her easy position against the cushion, while the  son took place on the divan, his head in her lap. Both of them,  looking out of the opening, could see a stretch of lower house-tops  in the vicinity, a bank of blue-blackness over in the west which they  knew to be mountains, and the sky, its shadowy depths brilliant with  stars. The city was still. Only the winds stirred.    \"Amrah tells me something has happened to you,\" she said, caressing  his cheek. \"When my Judah was a child, I allowed small things to  trouble him, but he is now a man. He must not forget\"--her voice  became very soft--\"that one day he is to be my hero.\"    She spoke in the language almost lost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21528"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine, Volume 1,  No. 1, August 1850 (#19)"],[1,"r--a heavy plunge,  that made itself heard above the monotonous murmur of the falling flood.  Astonished, almost alarmed, he rose, and was hastening through the  thicket toward the Nut-hole, whence the noise had proceeded, when, as he  was about to cross the track that led from the manse to the main road to  Aberdeen, he beheld flying toward him a dark-mantled figure: he knew it  at once. Her hands stretched toward him, her face ghastly with the  death-white of intense horror, Barbara staggered toward him, and with a  sharp, short gasp, as if she dreaded to give utterance to deep fear by a  louder sound, she fainted at his very feet.    He thought no more of the Nut-hole, or of what might have happened  there, absorbed in his solicitude for his beloved cousin, but his  endeavors to restore her to animation were fruitless. The manse lay not  two hundred yards distant; so at such a juncture, regardless of what the  consequences might be to himself, he bore her in his arms; and not  without some difficulty, for the track was narrow and broken up, and the  night had darkened with falling rain. He reached the house. Fortunately,  there was no one in the parlor but Miss Henny; and the startled maiden,  seeing a stranger bearing the body of her niece, would have screamed,  had he not at once whispered his own name, briefly explained what had  happened, and entreated her to befriend them.    \"Gae awa', gae awa', laddie,\" said she, as she quickly brought some  vinegar from the sideboard and bathed her niece's brow with the  refreshing liquid. \"My brither maunna see you; nor, if I can help it,  sall he know acht o' this. Gae awa', Johnny dear; he'll be back, belive.  She's beginning to revive. I'll get her to bed, and tell him she's too  ill to attend prayers. God bless you, my ain dawtie, what's a' this?\"  added she, kissing the brow of the girl, whose eyes opened to perceive  the retiring form of her cousin.    If Barbara Comyn revealed to her good aunt the cause of her fright and  consequent illness, it is very certain that Miss Henny kept the secret.  Next morning, indeed, though with a wan face, Barbara appeared at  prayers; and Mr. Comyn had concluded reading a portion of the Gospel,  when a paper, falling out of the Bible, arrested his attention for a  moment. Only for a moment, however; for, mentally supplicating  forgiveness for that involuntary wandering of his thoughts from the act  of worship in which he was engaged, the good man knelt and prayed with  fervor. This sacred duty terminated, they sat down to the  breakfast-table, and then the minister slowly opened the paper, glanced  over it, turned deadly pale, and exclaimed,    \"The great and good God be around us! Let not the delusions of Satan  prevail, but keep from us the evil spirits that make us see things that  are not!\"    \"What is the matter, brither?\" cried the wondering Miss Henny, whilst,  as though chained to the table, Barbara neither moved nor spoke.    \"Take this, woman,\" said he, in a tremulous voice, \"and read it to me,  that I may be sure the same awful words that meet my sight also meet  yours.\"    And the astonished Henrietta, taking the paper, read what follows:         Last night, after leaving you, I was stopped by your sexton, my       landlord, David Bain, who led me out of the highroad to the       Nut-hole, under pretence of showing me a large salmon which he had       hooked but could not land. He there felled me to the earth, robbed       me, and flung my body into the river Dee. Pray for the soul of                                                           SIMON BRUCE.    When the awe-struck Henrietta ceased, she found that Barbara had  fainted; and the minister, in a whirl of distracting thoughts to which  he was unaccustomed, ascribing his child's swoon to terror, placed the  ominous paper in the Bible, and determined to make known the whole  mysterious case at once to Mr. Craigie, the chief magistrate of  Aberdeen. Not for a single instant did Mr. Comyn suspect a hoax, or  imagine the affair to be only the mischievous trick of some idler.  Indeed, such was not likely; the times were superstitious, nor were  there any persons connected or at variance with the family who were  liable to be suspected of having played off such a foolish and wicked  jest at the expense of the minister, even if any motive for doing so had  existed. The minister, therefore, hastened up stairs to change his coat,  leaving the Bible containing the document from the dead on the table;  while his sister, finding her niece better, left her to see that her  brother's best hat and gloves were ready.    We wonder what Barbara is about meanwhile.    Presently Mr. Comyn returned to the parlor, and putting the Bible in his  pocket, (for he dared not again look at the horrible piece of writing,)  set off at a quick pace for the town. Nor, as he hurried on, did he give  a passing glance at the track which diverged from the highroad toward  the Nut-tree-hole. The magistrate was at home, and great indeed was his  amazement when he heard the minister's story; but lo! when Mr. Comyn,  reverently taking the Bible from his pocket, opened it to show Mr.  Craigie the note, written as he declared in the peculiar handwriting of  his friend, he found nothing where he had deposited it but a piece of  blank paper, folded up in the same form, but utterly void. And then in  truth the worthy magistrate waxed somewhat wroth; at first accusing Mr.  Comyn of being credulously duped by some pawkie servant who owed him a  grudge, and ending by setting him down as \"clean daft, doited, and dazed  by too mickle study,\" (and in his ire he had very nearly added, \"too  much toddy.\") But, as in no amicable frame of temper the gentlemen were  about to quarrel downright, the magistrate asking the minister what  proof he could adduce of Mr. Bruce's not being alive and merry, a  seasonable and loud knocking at the street-door interrupted them; and  presently a servant entered to announce that a drowned man had been  found in the Dee, and that his body had been brought to the door!    With shaking limbs the minister followed Mr. Craigie down stairs to the  lobby, now full of people. It appeared that some men employed in the  salmon fisheries had, within the last hour, dragged their nets, in which  they had discovered the corpse of a man whose skull had been literally  smashed in twain by a violent blow.    It was, in fact, the body of Mr. Bruce. Here, indeed, was confirmation  strange of the statement which the mysterious and missing document had  contained; and both Mr. Craigie and the minister, exchanging looks that  expressed their mutual dismay, were sorely perplexed in their own minds  how to account for these singular events. The body was reverently laid  out in the hall, whilst the magistrate, summoning some of his officials,  and accompanied by the clergyman and one or two of the fishermen,  proceeded to the cottage of David Bain.    The bell-man was not at home, having gone, they said, \"to Mr. Comyn's,  to inquire about his lodger, Mr. Bruce, who had not come home to his bed  the night before, as was customary.\"    Strange glances passed between the auditors; but a sign from the  magistrate imposed silence, and they departed, determining to survey the  Nut-hole, near which, in the river, the body had been found in the nets,  after which they had no doubt they would find the sexton at the manse.  As they threaded the thicket of hazel, at some distance from the pool,  one of the salmon-fishers declared, that from a plot of white-thorn and  bramble-bushes he had seen the eyes of a foumart or polecat glare out  upon him; and in a low voice, directing the attention of a comrade to  the spot, they both imagined they could detect the figure of a man  crouching among the trailing shrubs. Whispering their suspicion to Mr.  Craigie, he ordered the whole party to join quietly in a search, and  follow him and the minister to the Nut-hole. Thither, then, the  magistrate, attended only by Mr. Comyn, proceeded; and who, think ye,  found they there?    A young man, handsome and well-dressed, in the undisguised apparel of a  gentleman, stood there, evidently unconscious of the advancing twain. He  held a stout, club-like stick in his hand, which he was examining  intently--for it was covered with blood, now dried, and amidst which  stuck clots of hair! As the gentlemen came suddenly upon him he started,  and dropped the stick; whilst Mr. Comyn, staring at him in wonder, for,  as we have said, all disguise had been discarded, exclaimed--    \"John Percival, is this you?\"    A question which the young man could have answered in the affirmative  with strict veracity, but for the assertion from the magistrate which  followed it up.    \"And you, sir, are the murderer of Mr. Bruce!\"    \"Good God! what do you mean!\" cried the horrified youth.    \"That stick, which you have just dropped, is covered with blood,\" said  Mr. Craigie; \"a foul murder has been committed, and we find you with the  supposed instrument of that murder, near the very spot where there is  ground to believe the act was perpetrated.\"    A fearful pang shot through Percival's frame, but conscious innocence  made it brief, and with a calmness of demeanor which guilt never could  have assumed, and gravely smiling, he turned to his uncle saying--    \"_You_ cannot believe that I am guilty?\"    \"No, no, John!\" answered the individual appealed to. \"God forbid that I  should judge you wrongfully, but--\"    \"But,\" interrupted the magistrate, \"not only does it appear that you  have slain a man, but that, desirous of fixing your guilt upon another,  you have written a letter, falsely accusing an innocent person of that  crime.\"    \"Letter!\" repeated Percival, \"Sir, I do not even know what you mean.\"    \"Mr. Comyn,\" asked the magistrate, \"this young man--the nephew of my  lamented friend, your late wife--paid court, as I understand, to your  daughter, "]]]
