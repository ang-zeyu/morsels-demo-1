Rice, mixed with oil of cocoanuts, was then  offered to us, which my companions ate greedily and grew fat. My unhappy  friends were then devoured one after another, having become appetizing  to the cannibals. But I languished so much that they did not think me  fit to eat. They left me to the care of an old man, from whom I managed  to escape; and taking care to go a contrary way from that which the  savages had taken I never stopped till night. At the end of seven days,  on the seashore I found a number of white persons gathering pepper. They  asked me in Arabic who I was, and whence I came; and I gave them an  account of the shipwreck, and of my escape. They treated me kindly and  presented me to their King, who treated me with great liberality. During  my stay with them, I observed that when the King and his nobles went  hunting, they rode their horses without bridle or saddle. With the  assistance of some workmen I made a bridle and saddle, and having put  them upon one of the King's horses, presented the animal, thus  equipped, to His Majesty. He was so delighted that he instantly mounted  and rode about the grounds almost the whole day. All the ministers of  state and the nobility induced me to make saddles and bridles for them,  for which they made me such magnificent presents that I soon became very  rich. The King at last requested that I would marry, and become one of  his nation. From a variety of circumstances I could not refuse, and he  therefore gave me one of the ladies of his Court, who was young, rich,  beautiful, and virtuous. We lived in the greatest harmony in a palace  belonging to my wife. I had made a good friend of a very worthy man who  lived in this place. Hearing one day that his wife had just died, I went  to condole with him on this unexpected calamity. We were alone together,  and he appeared to be in the deepest grief. After I had talked with him  some time on the uselessness of so much sorrow, he told me that it was  an established law that the living husband should be buried with the  deceased wife, and that within an hour he must submit. I shuddered at  the dreadful custom. In a short time the woman was attired in her most  costly dress and jewels, and placed in an open coffin. The procession  then began, the husband following the corpse. They ascended to the top  of an exceedingly high mountain, and a great stone was removed, which  covered the mouth of a deep pit. The corpse was let down, and the  husband, having taken leave of his friends, was put into another open  coffin, with a pot of water and seven small loaves, and he was let down.  The stone was replaced and they all returned. The horror of this was  still fresh upon my mind, when my wife fell sick and died. The King and  the whole Court, out of respect to me, instantly prepared to assist at a  similar ceremony with me. I restrained the feeling of despair until we  arrived at the top of the mountain, when I fell at the feet of the King  and begged him to spare my life. All I said was ineffectual, and after  my wife was let down, I also was put into the deep pit, everyone being  totally indifferent to my cries and lamentations. I made the cave echo  with my vain complaints. I lived some days on the bread and water which  had been put into my coffin, but this supply was at length exhausted. I  then wandered to a remote part of this frightful cave and lay down to  prepare for death. I was thus wishing only for a speedy termination of  my misery, when I heard something walking and panting. I started up,  upon which the thing panted still more, and then ran away. I pursued it,  and sometimes it seemed to stop, but on my approach continued to go on  before me. I pursued it, until at last I saw a glimmering light like a  star. This redoubled my eagerness, until at last I discovered a hole  large enough to allow my escape. I crept through the aperture, and found  myself on the seashore, and discovered that the creature was a sea  monster which had been accustomed to enter at that hole to feed upon the  dead bodies. Having eaten some shellfish, I returned to the cave, where  I collected all the jewels I could find in the dark. These I carried to  the seashore, and tied them up very neatly into bales with the cords  that let down the coffins. I laid them on the beach, waiting till some  ship should pass. In two days a ship came out of the harbor, and passed  by that part of the coast. I made a signal, and a boat took me on board.  I was obliged to say that I had been wrecked; for, had they known my  real story, I should have been carried back, as the captain was a  native of this country. We touched at several islands, and at the port  of Kela, where I found a ship ready to sail for Balsora; and having  presented some jewels to the captain who had brought me to Kela, I  sailed, and at last arrived at Bagdad.    [Illustration]      THE FIFTH VOYAGE    [Illustration]    Having forgotten my former perils, I built a ship at my own expense,  loaded it with a rich cargo, and, taking with me other merchants, once  more set sail. We were much driven about by a storm, and at length  landed upon a desert island to search for fresh water. There we found a  roc's egg, equal in size to the one I had seen before. The merchants and  sailors gathered round it, and though I advised them not to meddle with  it, they nevertheless made a hole in it with their hatchets, and picked  out the young roc, piece after piece, and roasted it. They had scarcely  finished when two of the old birds appeared in the air. We hurried on  board ship and set sail, but had not gone far before we saw the immense  birds approaching us, and soon after they hovered over the ship. One of  them let fall an enormous fragment of stone, which fell into the sea  close beside the ship, but the other let fall a piece which split our  ship. I caught hold of a bit of the wreck, on which I was borne by the  wind and tide to an island, the shore of which was very steep. I reached  the dry land, and found the most delicious fruits and excellent water,  which refreshed me. Farther in the island I saw a feeble old man sitting  near a rivulet. When I enquired of him how he came there, he only  answered by signs for me to carry him over the rivulet, that he might  eat some fruit. I took him on my back, and crossed the brook, but  instead of getting down, he clasped his legs so firmly round my throat  that I thought he would strangle me. I soon fainted with pain and  fright. When I recovered, the old fellow was still sitting on my neck,  and he quickly made me rise up and walk under the trees, while he  gathered the fruit at his ease. This lasted a long time. One day, while  carrying him about, I picked up a large gourd called a calabash, and,  having cleared out the inside, I pressed into it the juice of grapes.  Having filled it, I left it for several days, and at length found that  it became excellent wine. I drank of this, and for a while forgot my  sorrows, so that I began to sing with cheerfulness. The old man made me  give him the calabash, and liking the flavor of the wine, he drank it  off, soon became intoxicated, fell from my shoulders, and, died in  convulsions. I hastened to the seaside, and presently found the crew of  a ship. They told me I had fallen into the hands of the Old Man of the  Sea, and was the first person that had ever escaped. I sailed with them,  and the captain, when we landed, took me to some persons whose  employment was to gather cocoanuts. We all took up stones and pelted the  monkeys that were at the very top of the cocoanut trees, and these  animals in return pelted us with cocoanuts. When we had obtained as  many as we could carry, we returned to the town. I soon obtained a  considerable sum by the cocoanuts I thus gathered, and at length sailed  for my native land.      THE SIXTH VOYAGE    [Illustration]    At the expiration of another year, I prepared for a sixth voyage. This  proved very long and unfortunate, for the pilot lost his course and knew  not where to steer. At length he told us we must inevitably be dashed to  pieces against a rock, which we were fast approaching. In a few moments  the vessel was a complete wreck. We saved our lives, our provisions, and  our goods.    The shore on which we were cast was at the foot of a mountain which it  was impossible to climb, so that I shortly beheld my companions die one  after another. There was a frightful cavern in the rock, through which  flowed a river. To this, in a fit of desperation, I resolved to trust  myself. I went to work and made a long raft. I loaded it with bales of  rich stuffs, and large pieces of rock crystal, of which the mountain was  in a great measure formed. I went on board the raft, and the current  carried me along. I was carried in darkness during many days, and at  last fell asleep. When I awoke, I found myself in a pleasant country.  My raft was tied up and some blacks, who were near me, said that they  had found me floating in the river which waters their land. They took me  to their King, and carefully conducted my cargo with me. When we came to  the city of Serindib, I related my story to the monarch, who ordered it  to be written in letters of gold. I presented the King with some of the  most beautiful pieces of rock crystal, and entreated him to let me  return to my own country, which he readily agreed to, and even gave me  a letter and a present to my sovereign, the Caliph Haroun Alrashid. The  present consisted of a ruby made into a cup, and decorated with pearls;  the skin of a serpent, which appeared like burnished gold, and which  could repel disease; some aloe-wood, camphire, and a beautiful female  slave. I returned to my native country, delivered the present to the  Caliph, and received his thanks, with a reward.

But I had able assistants  (Mr. Henry Goodsir, Mr. Edward Forbes, and my brother), from whom I  expected a good deal of aid. Some very beautiful drawings of this whale,  made for me by Mr. Edward Forbes and by my brother, are still in my  possession.    It was easy to see, by the dorsal fin and by the numerous plaits or  folds on the abdominal surface of the throat and chest, before any  dissection, that the specimen was a young Balaenopterous whale, differing  in a great many points from the true whale or _Mysticetus_: for, 1st,  the form of the head was entirely different; 2nd, it had a dorsal fin;  and, 3rd, occupying the lower surface of the throat and thorax were  numerous folds of the integuments. To this class of whales I have been  in the habit of giving the name of Rorqual, to distinguish them from the  other class of Whalebone Whales, the _Mysticetus_ both _borealis_ and  _australis_.    It appears from my notes, that at that time M. G. Cuvier considered the  species I now describe as identical with the Great Rorqual I had  described about two years previously; but I felt convinced then, as now,  that they form distinct species, and in this opinion some continental  anatomists seem to coincide.    Being persuaded that there was some inaccuracy in former drawings of the  species, I had the specimen suspended and drawn with great care by Mr.  Edward Forbes. This position explained the mechanism of the mouth,  showing its great size, even in the short Balaena Whales; its great  capacity in the _Mysticetus_ had never been doubted.    As to the species, the conclusion I arrived at was, that the specimen  belonged to that termed by Fabricius _rostrata_, and that individuals of  the species had been seen by John Hunter, Sir James Watson, and  Fabricius.      _Measurements._                                       ft.  in.

At the extremity of the snout in either jaw there were 8 strong  bristles, being the only vestiges of hair found on the external surface.  The mouth was of great size; the tongue large and tolerably free, and of  a pale rose or vermilion colour. The baleen, where deepest, measured  about 4 inches; there were 370 plates on each side; but anteriorly and  posteriorly these plates were reduced to mere bristles.    The isthmus faucium allowed the closed hand to pass through it; through  this isthmus I do not believe that any water ever passes into the  pharynx, unless it be accidentally, as in man. The \"spout\" of the  Whalebone Whale is composed, no doubt, of the pulmonary vapour, and not  of any water received into the pharynx from the mouth.    The stomach seemed composed of five compartments externally, but  presented only four when laid open, the fifth being manifestly the  duodenum. In the intestines no remains of food were found, but abundance  of intestinal worms, and a substance strongly resembling the human  meconium. There was an ilio-caecal valve as distinct as in man. In the  rectum the folds of the mucous membrane were transverse.    _Organs of Respiration_.--The external nostrils were double; and the  cavities of the nostrils provided with the remarkable cartilages and  muscular apparatus I discovered and described in the anatomy of the  Great Rorqual. In this specimen they were about 4 inches in length, but  of as many feet in the large Rorqual. The mode of breathing in the  Rorquals does not differ much from that in man, with the exception of  the apparatus of the protruding cartilages, which in man are  rudimentary.    The _Olfactory Nerves_ were quite as large as in other mammals; and in  this respect the Balaena Whales are quite unlike the Dolphins[E].    The trachea communicated, near its upper part, with a sac or pouch; the  lungs were each composed of a single lobe. The rings of the trachea were  mostly deficient anteriorly. In the heart the foetal arrangements had  wholly disappeared. The dura mater seemed divisible into three layers,  the external being vascular. A remarkable vascular substance connected  with this layer covers the back part of the brain and cerebellum,  extending into the spinal canal, and even into the chest. At the base of  the brain the vascular plexus was about 2 inches in thickness. It is, as  is well known, a sort of erectile tissue, of whose functions we are  wholly ignorant. It is not confined to this course, but extends to the  neck, and, passing through the foramina intervertebralia, fills the  intercostal spaces exterior to the pleura.    There was evidently a canal in the centre of the spinal marrow. Wherever  the nerves of the lungs and stomach were traced, they terminated in  loops. We did not observe in the Great Rorqual any tracheal pouch like  that in the smaller; but it may have escaped notice: if absent in the  Great Rorqual, it would be another proof of the distinctness of the  species.    The doubts raised by M. St. Hilaire, as to the Whale being a mammal in  the true sense of the term, were set aside long ago by an appeal to  facts. The young of the Whale tribe suckle like the young of all  mammals; nevertheless I showed, in 1834, that the lactiferous glands in  the _Balaenopterae_ differ in structure from the same organs in most  mammals.    I do not find in my notes anything to add to the description of the  Great Rorqual already published in the 'Transactions of the Royal  Society of Edinburgh' for 1827, to which I beg leave to refer the  reader.    A single remark must be added regarding the nature of the vascular  plexus which, in the Cetacea, surrounds the spinal marrow, and extends  into the chest. On selecting the artery which seemed to form the plexus,  which was, if I rightly recollect, in this instance an intercostal  artery, and dissecting it under water, I found, to my surprise, that the  artery, so long as I followed it, never gave off any branches, but  continued of the same calibre throughout, making innumerable  flexuosities or turnings. Thus, on a plexiform mass of this kind being  cut across, the first impression is, that a great number of arterial  branches or arteries have been divided, whilst in fact the entire plexus  seems to be formed of one artery.    As was to be expected of animals so much withdrawn from human  observation, there is but little to say on the natural history of the  Cetacea properly so called. Their food, no doubt, is various, and seems  to have little or no relation to the character of their dentition. The  enormous Cachalot, with its vast teeth implanted only in one jaw, is  generally understood to prey chiefly on the Cuttlefish. The food of the  true Whale, or _Mysticetus_, is well known to be the Clio and other  smaller Mollusca, with which certain regions of the ocean abound; the  same, or similar, is probably the food of the more active and restless  Rorquals, found in both hemispheres. The Dolphins, or Toothed Whales,  generally prey, no doubt, on fishes of various kinds; yet, even as  regards these, it has been proved by my esteemed friend, the late Mr.  Henry Goodsir, that some of the largest, following in the wake of the  herring shoals, prey not on these, but on the various microscopic food  (the Entomostraca and other marine"]]]
