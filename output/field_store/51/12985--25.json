There is a work which the  neutrals can do; they can offer mediation, jointly or severally. It is  not an act of hostility, but an act of friendship. The Hague  Convention, to which all the Governments are parties, expressly  declares that the offer of mediation shall not be considered an  unfriendly act. The duty of offering mediation may seem to rest  primarily upon the United States, the largest of the neutral nations,  and the one most intimately bound by ties of blood to all the  belligerents. The United States did make an offer immediately after  the war began. But why not again and again and again, until our offer  or some other offer is accepted? Why not stand at the door and knock,  as we would at the door of a friend if we felt that the friend was in  need and that we could render a service?    But our action or failure to act need not deter any other neutral  country from acting. This is not a time to stand on ceremony; if  any other country, for any reason, no matter what that reason may be,  is in a better position than we to tender its good offices, it should  not delay for a moment. It is for the belligerents to decide which  offer, if any, they will accept. I am sure they will not complain if,  following the promptings of our hearts, we beseech them to let us help  them back to the paths of peace.    Will they object on the ground that they will not consent to any peace  until they have assurances that it will be a permanent peace? That  suggestion has been made--I think both sides have expressed a desire  that the peace, when secured, shall be permanent--but who can give a  pledge as to the future? If fear that the peace may not be permanent  is given as the reason for refusal it is not a sufficient reason.  While no one can stand surety for what may come, it is not difficult  to adopt measures which will give far greater assurance of permanent  peace than the world has ever known before.    Second--The treaty in which they join should provide for investigation  by a permanent international commission of every dispute that may  arise, no matter what its character or nature. The United States has  already made thirty treaties embodying this principle, and these  thirty treaties link our country to nearly three-quarters of all the  inhabitants of the world. We have such a treaty in force between the  United States and four of the countries now at war--Great Britain,  France, Russia, and Italy. The principle of this treaty has been  accepted by three other belligerents--Germany, Austria, and  Belgium--although treaties with these nations have not yet been  negotiated. These seven warring nations have indorsed the principle  embodied in these treaties, namely, that there shall be no declaration  of war or commencement of hostilities until the subject in dispute has  been investigated by an international commission. Why cannot they  apply the principle as between themselves? What cause of war is of  such magnitude that nations can afford to commence shooting at each  other before the cause is investigated? A treaty such as those which  now protect the peace of the United States would give a year's time  for investigation and report, and who doubts that a year's time would  be sufficient to reach an amicable settlement of almost every  difficulty?    Does any one suppose that the present war would have been begun if a  year's time had been taken to investigate the dispute between Austria  and Serbia? It will be remembered that Serbia had only twenty-four  hours in which to reply, and it will also be remembered that during  this brief time the rulers of the Old World endeavored to find a means  of preventing war. If they had only had some machinery which they  could have employed to avert war, how gladly would they have availed  themselves of it! The machinery provided by treaty can be resorted to  with honor--yes, with honor--no matter how high a sense of honor the  nation has. The trouble has been that, while the nations were  abundantly provided with machinery for conducting war, they possessed  no machinery for the promotion of peace. A year's time allows passion  to subside and reason to resume its sway. It allows man to act when he  is calm instead of having to act when he is angry. When a man is angry  he swaggers around and talks about what he can do, and he often  overestimates his strength; when he is calm he considers what he ought  to do. When he is angry he hears the rumbling of earthquakes and the  sweep of the hurricane; when he is calm he listens to the still small  voice of conscience.    Third--While the period of investigation provided for in our treaties  will go far toward preventing war, still even a year's deliberation  does not give complete protection. In order to secure the  investigation of all questions without exception it was necessary to  reserve to the contracting parties liberty of action at the conclusion  of the investigation. War is thus reduced from a probability to a mere  possibility, and this is an immeasurable advance; but the assurance of  permanent peace cannot be given until the desire for war is  eradicated from the human heart. Compulsory periods of investigation  supply the machinery by which nations can maintain peace with honor if  they so desire; but the final work of the advocates of peace is  educational--it is the cultivation of the spirit of brotherhood  condensed into the commandment \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as  thyself.\" Is it impossible to imagine a civilization in which  greatness will be measured by service and in which the rivalry will be  a rivalry in doing good? No one doubts that the lot of each member of  society would be infinitely better under such conditions; why not  strive to bring about such conditions? Is it visionary to hope and  labor for this end? \"Where there is no vision the people perish.\" It  is a \"death grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word.\"  The old system has broken down; it can let loose the furies, but it  cannot bind them; it is impotent to save. The question is not whether  the Word will triumph--that is certain--but when? And after what  sufferings?    Thomas Carlyle, his voice rising clear and strong above the babble of  Mammon, asked, in the closing chapters of his French Revolution:    \"Hast thou considered how Thought is stronger than Artillery Parks,  and (were it fifty years after death and martyrdom, or were it two  thousand years) writes and unwrites Acts of Parliament, removes  mountains, models the World like soft clay? Also how the beginning of  all Thought worth the name is Love.\"    The truth which he uttered is still truth, and no matter who uttered  it, the thought is the thought of Him who spake as never man spake;  who was described in prophecy as the Prince of Peace; whose coming was  greeted with the song of \"Peace on earth; good-will to men,\" and whose  teachings, when applied, will usher in the enduring peace of a  universal brotherhood.    W.J. BRYAN.          Bryan, Idealist and Average Man    By Charles Willis Thompson         The subjoined estimate of William J. Bryan's character and       public career, which appeared in THE NEW YORK TIMES of June       9, 1915, is by the hand of one of its staff writers who has       specialized in American national politics.      The plain man of the prairie became Secretary of State when William J.  Bryan did; the prairie then entered diplomacy, international  controversy. The secret of all that has puzzled the land in his  behavior lies in that fact. His hold on the West lies in the fact that  he is in himself the average man of that country, with that man's  ideals, aspirations, defects, and drawbacks. There seems nothing  strange or funny in a Secretary of State who goes to New York and  signs temperance pledges, or holds Billy Sunday's platform in  Philadelphia, when you get a few miles away from the cities; and if it  seems a little queer to New York to find the Secretary of State  undertaking to demolish the Darwinian theory, there are plenty of  regions where the Darwinian theory is regarded as a device of the  devil to upset the Mosaic cosmogony. Chesterton says that Dickens  never wrote down to the mob, because he was himself the mob; and Bryan  never talked down to the men of the prairie for the same reason.    He is not a man of culture, nor of reading. He has been around the  world, but when he came back the books and articles he wrote were such  as might have been published as guide books or in encyclopedias; he  could have written them without leaving home. Travel had no  broadening or polishing effect upon his mind.    The vast influence he still has is due to the fact that the common  man, with all his mistakes and gaucheries, speaks in him, and that  when the common man hears his own thoughts spoken in Bryan's voice he  knows that the accent is sincere. Bryan may have taken up this or that  particular issue because it sounded like a vote-maker, but none of  them represented the least divergence from his course as a whole,  which has always been honestly bent in a certain plain direction. He  never hesitated to be in a minority and never dodged a fight. He is an  innocent theorist, who frequently goes wrong because of the simplicity  of his mental processes; but he acts upon his theories, right or  wrong, with an intrepidity and a whole-hearted courage in which the  ordinary man sees the qualities he himself would like to have, and  dreams he has. His mind is not broad, but it is strong; he is always  sure he is right, and always ready to fight for his beliefs, and he  keeps his hold upon his followers because he is not below them, and  not much above them, and because they know he is honest and sincere.    In 1906, the Democratic Party, picking itself out of the wreckage of  Parker's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#19)"],[1,"books, or  have them written, for sale; nor may the chief officer of a province  venture to keep books without leave obtained from the chief officer of the  whole Order; no brother may keep the books assigned to him, unless they  are altogether the property of the Order--and so forth[144]. A century  later, when Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, was writing his  _Philobiblon_ (completed 24 January, 1344-45), he could say of them and  the other friars--whom, be it remembered, he, as a regular, would regard  with scant favour--        But whenever it happened that we turned aside to the      cities and places where the Mendicants had their      convents we did not disdain to visit their libraries and      any other repositories of books; nay there we found      heaped up amidst the utmost poverty the utmost riches of      wisdom. We discovered in their fardels and baskets not      only crumbs falling from the master's table for the      dogs, but the shewbread without leaven and the bread of      angels having in it all that is delicious; and indeed      the garners of Joseph full of corn, and all the spoil of      the Egyptians and the very precious gifts which Queen      Sheba brought to Solomon.        These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the      summer, and ingenious bees continually fabricating cells      of honey.... And to pay due regard to truth ... although      they lately at the eleventh hour have entered the Lord's      vineyard ..., they have added more in this brief hour to      the stock of the sacred books than all the other      vinedressers; following in the footsteps of Paul, the      last to be called but the first in preaching, who spread      the gospel of Christ more widely than all others[145].    At Assisi, the parent house of the Franciscan Order, there was a library  of considerable extent, many volumes of which still exist, with a  catalogue drawn up in 1381.    At this point I will resume the conclusions which may be deduced from this  examination of the Benedictine Rule and the Customs founded upon it.    In the first place they all assume the existence of a library. S. Benedict  contents himself with general directions about study. The Cluniacs put the  books in charge of the precentor, who is to be called also _armarius_, and  they prescribe an annual audit of them, with the assignment of a single  volume to each brother, on the security of a written attestation of the  fact. These regulations were adopted by the Benedictines, with fuller  rules for the librarian, who is still precentor also. He is to keep both  presses and books in repair, and personally to supervise the daily use of  the manuscripts, restoring to their proper places those that brethren may  have been reading. Among these rules permission to lend books on receipt  of a pledge first makes its appearance. The Carthusians maintain the  principle of lending. Each brother might have two books, and he is to be  specially careful to keep them clean. The Cistercians appoint a special  officer to have charge of the books, about the safety of which great care  is to be taken, and at certain times of the day he is to lock the press.  The Augustinians and the Premonstratensians follow the Cluniacs and  Benedictines: but the Premonstratensians direct their librarian to take  note of the books that the House borrows as well as of those that it  lends; and they adopt the Cistercian precaution about his opening and  locking the press.    Secondly, by the time that Lanfranc was writing his statutes for English  Benedictines, it was evidently contemplated that the number of books would  have exceeded the number of brethren, for the keeper of the books is  directed to bring all the books of the House into Chapter, and after that  the brethren, one by one, are to bring in the books which they have  borrowed[146]. Among the books belonging to the House there were probably  some service-books; but, from the language used, it appears to me that we  may fairly conclude that by the end of the eleventh century Benedictine  Houses had two sets of books: (1) those which were distributed among the  brethren; (2) those which were kept in some safe place, as part of the  possessions of the House: or, to adopt modern phrases, that they had a  lending library and a library of reference.    Thirdly, it is evident that the loan of books to persons in general, on  adequate security, began at a very early date. On this account I have  already ventured to call monastic libraries the public libraries of the  Middle Ages. As time went on, the practice was developed, and at last  became general. It was even enjoined upon monks as a duty by their  ecclesiastical superiors. In 1212 a Council which met at Paris made the  following decree, but I am not able to say whether it was accepted out of  France:        We forbid those who belong to a religious Order, to      formulate any vow against lending their books to those      who are in need of them; seeing that to lend is      enumerated among the principal works of mercy.        After careful consideration, let some books be kept in      the House for the use of brethren; others, according to      the decision of the abbat, be lent to those who are in      need of them, the rights of the House being      safe-guarded.        From the present date no book is to be retained under      pain of incurring a curse [for its alienation], and we      declare all such curses to be of no effect[147].    In the same century many volumes were bequeathed to the Augustinian House  of S. Victor, Paris, on the express condition that they should be so  lent[148]. It is almost needless to add that one abbey was continually  lending to another, either for reading or for copying[149].    Houses which lent liberally would probably be the first to relax  discipline so far as to admit strangers to their libraries; and in the  sixteenth and following centuries the libraries of the Benedictine House  of S. Germain des Pres, Paris, as well as the already mentioned House of  S. Victor, were open to all comers on certain days in the week.    When we try to realise the feelings with which monastic communities  regarded books, it must always be remembered that they had a paternal  interest in them. In many cases they had been written in the very House in  which they were afterwards read from generation to generation: and if not,  they had probably been procured by the exchange of some work so written.  In fact, if a book was not a son of the House, it was at least a nephew.    The conviction that books were a possession with which no convent could  dispense, appears in many medieval writers. The whole matter is summed up  in the phrase, written about 1170, \"claustrum sine armario, castrum sine  armamentario[150],\" an epigram which I will not spoil by trying to  translate it; and even more clearly in the passionate utterances of Thomas  a Kempis on the desolate condition of priest and convent without  books[151]. The \"round of creation\" is explored for similes to enforce  this truth. A priest so situated is like a horse without bridle, a ship  without oars, a writer without pens, a bird without wings, etc.; while the  House is like a kitchen without stewpans, a table without food, a well  without water, a river without fish--and many other things which I have no  space to mention.    Evidence of the solicitude with which they protected their treasures is  not wanting. The very mode of holding a manuscript was prescribed, if not  by law, at least by general custom. \"When the religious are engaged in  reading in cloister or in church,\" says an Order of the General  Benedictine Chapter, \"they shall if possible hold the books in their left  hands, wrapped in the sleeve of their tunics, and resting on their knees;  their right hands shall be uncovered with which to hold and turn the  leaves of the aforesaid books[152].\" In a manuscript at Monte Cassino[153]  is the practical injunction      Quisquis quem tetigerit    Sit illi lota manus;    and at the same House the possession of handkerchiefs--which were  evidently regarded as effeminate inventions--is specially excused on the  ground that they would be useful--among other things--\"for wrapping round  the manuscripts which brethren handle[154].\" Of similar import is the  distich at the end of a fine manuscript formerly in the library of S.  Victor:      Qui servare libris preciosis nescit honorem    Illius a manibus sit procul iste liber[155].    With these injunctions may be compared a note in a fourteenth century  manuscript from the same library:        Whoever pursues his studies in this book, should be      careful to handle the leaves gently and delicately, so      as to avoid tearing them by reason of their thinness;      and let him imitate the example of Jesus Christ, who,      when he had quietly opened the book of Isaiah and read      therein attentively, rolled it up with reverence, and      gave it again to the minister[156];    and the advice of Thomas a Kempis to the youthful students for whose  benefit he composed the treatise called _Doctrinale Juvenum_ which I have  already quoted:        Take thou a book into thine hands as Simeon the Just      took the Child Jesus into his arms to carry him and kiss      him. And when thou hast finished reading, close the book      and give thanks for every word out of the mouth of God;      because in the Lord's field thou hast found a hidden      treasure[157].    In a similar strain a writer or copyist entreats readers to be careful of  his work--work which has cost him an amount of pains that they cannot  realise. It is impossible to translate the original exactly, but I hope  that I have given the meaning with tolerable clearness:        I beseech you, my friend, when you are reading my book      to keep your hands behind its back, for fear you should      do mischief to the text by some sudden movement; for a   "]]]
