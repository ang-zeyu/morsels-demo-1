[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],[0,"My Reminiscences (#19)"],[1," many  experiments we succeeded in making a boxful of matches. The patriotic  enthusiasm which was thus evidenced did not constitute their only value,  for the money that was spent in their making might have served to light  the family hearth for the space of a year. Another little defect was  that these matches could not be got to burn unless there was a light  handy to touch them up with. If they could only have inherited some of  the patriotic flame of which they were born they might have been  marketable even to-day.    News came to us that some young student was trying to make a power loom.  Off we went to see it. None of us had the knowledge with which to test  its practical usefulness, but in our capacity for believing and hoping  we were inferior to none. The poor fellow had got into a bit of debt  over the cost of his machine which we repaid for him. Then one day we  found Braja Babu coming over to our house with a flimsy country towel  tied round his head. \"Made in our loom!\" he shouted as with hands  uplifted he executed a war-dance. The outside of Braja Babu's head had  then already begun to ripen into grey!    At last some worldly-wise people came and joined our society, made us  taste of the fruit of knowledge, and broke up our little paradise.    When I first knew Rajnarain Babu, I was not old enough to appreciate his  many-sidedness. In him were combined many opposites. In spite of his  hoary hair and beard he was as young as the youngest of us, his  venerable exterior serving only as a white mantle for keeping his youth  perpetually fresh. Even his extensive learning had not been able to do  him any damage, for it left him absolutely simple. To the end of his  life the incessant flow of his hearty laughter suffered no check,  neither from the gravity of age, nor ill-health, nor domestic  affliction, nor profundity of thought, nor variety of knowledge, all of  which had been his in ample measure. He had been a favourite pupil of  Richardson and brought up in an atmosphere of English learning,  nevertheless he flung aside all obstacles due to his early habit and  gave himself up lovingly and devotedly to Bengali literature. Though the  meekest of men, he was full of fire which flamed its fiercest in his  patriotism, as though to burn to ashes the shortcomings and destitution  of his country. The memory of this smile-sweetened fervour-illumined  lifelong-youthful saint is one that is worth cherishing by our  countrymen.          (23) _The Bharati_      On the whole the period of which I am writing was for me one of ecstatic  excitement. Many a night have I spent without sleep, not for any  particular reason but from a mere desire to do the reverse of the  obvious. I would keep up reading in the dim light of our school room all  alone; the distant church clock would chime every quarter as if each  passing hour was being put up to auction; and the loud _Haribols_ of the  bearers of the dead, passing along Chitpore Road on their way to the  Nimtollah cremation ground, would now and then resound. Through some  summer moonlight nights I would be wandering about like an unquiet  spirit among the lights and shadows of the tubs and pots on the garden  of the roof-terrace.    Those who would dismiss this as sheer poetising would be wrong. The very  earth in spite of its having aged considerably surprises us occasionally  by its departure from sober stability; in the days of its youth, when  it had not become hardened and crusty, it was effusively volcanic and  indulged in many a wild escapade. In the days of man's first youth the  same sort of thing happens. So long as the materials which go to form  his life have not taken on their final shape they are apt to be  turbulent in the process of their formation.    This was the time when my brother Jyotirindra decided to start the  _Bharati_ with our eldest brother as editor, giving us fresh food for  enthusiasm. I was then just sixteen, but I was not left out of the  editorial staff. A short time before, in all the insolence of my  youthful vanity, I had written a criticism of the _Meghanadabadha_. As  acidity is characteristic of the unripe mango so is abuse of the  immature critic. When other powers are lacking, the power of pricking  seems to be at its sharpest. I had thus sought immortality by leaving my  scratches on that immortal epic. This impudent criticism was my first  contribution to the Bharati.    In the first volume I also published a long poem called _Kavikahini_,  The Poet's Story. It was the product of an age when the writer had seen  practically nothing of the world except an exaggerated image of his own  nebulous self. So the hero of the story was naturally a poet, not the  writer as he was, but as he imagined or desired himself to seem. It  would hardly be correct to say that he desired to _be_ what he  portrayed; that represented more what he thought was expected of him,  what would make the world admiringly nod and say: \"Yes, a poet indeed,  quite the correct thing.\" In it was a great parade of universal love,  that pet subject of the budding poet, which sounds as big as it is easy  to talk about. While yet any truth has not dawned upon one's own mind,  and others' words are one's only stock-in-trade, simplicity and  restraint in expression are not possible. Then, in the endeavour to  display magnified that which is really big in itself, it becomes  impossible to avoid a grotesque and ridiculous exhibition.    When I blush to read these effusions of my boyhood I am also struck with  the fear that very possibly in my later writings the same distortion,  wrought by straining after effect, lurks in a less obvious form. The  loudness of my voice, I doubt not, often drowns the thing I would say;  and some day or other Time will find me out.    The _Kavikahini_ was the first work of mine to appear in book form. When  I went with my second brother to Ahmedabad, some enthusiastic friend of  mine took me by surprise by printing and publishing it and sending me a  copy. I cannot say that he did well, but the feeling that was roused in  me at the time did not resemble that of an indignant judge. He got his  punishment, however, not from the author, but from the public who hold  the purse strings. I have heard that the dead load of the books lay, for  many a long day, heavy on the shelves of the booksellers and the mind of  the luckless publisher.    Writings of the age at which I began to contribute to the _Bharati_  cannot possibly be fit for publication. There is no better way of  ensuring repentance at maturity than to rush into print too early. But  it has one redeeming feature: the irresistible impulse to see one's  writings in print exhausts itself during early life. Who are the  readers, what do they say, what printers' errors have remained  uncorrected, these and the like worries run their course as infantile  maladies and leave one leisure in later life to attend to one's literary  work in a healthier frame of mind.    Bengali literature is not old enough to have elaborated those internal  checks which can serve to control its votaries. As experience in writing  is gained the Bengali writer has to evolve the restraining force from  within himself. This makes it impossible for him to avoid the creation  of a great deal of rubbish during a considerable length of time. The  ambition to work wonders with the modest gifts at one's disposal is  bound to be an obsession in the beginning, so that the effort to  transcend at every step one's natural powers, and therewith the bounds  of truth and beauty, is always visible in early writings. To recover  one's normal self, to learn to respect one's powers as they are, is a  matter of time.    However that may be, I have left much of youthful folly to be ashamed  of, besmirching the pages of the _Bharati_; and this shames me not for  its literary defects alone but for its atrocious impudence, its  extravagant excesses and its high-sounding artificiality. At the same  time I am free to recognise that the writings of that period were  pervaded with an enthusiasm the value of which cannot be small. It was a  period to which, if error was natural, so was the boyish faculty of  hoping, believing and rejoicing. And if the fuel of error was necessary  for feeding the flame of enthusiasm then while that which was fit to be  reduced to ashes will have become ash, the good work done by the flame  will not have been in vain in my life.          PART V          (24) _Ahmedabad_      When the _Bharati_ entered upon its second year, my second brother  proposed to take me to England; and when my father gave his consent,  this further unasked favour of providence came on me as a surprise.    As a first step I accompanied my brother to Ahmedabad where he was  posted as judge. My sister-in-law with her children was then in England,  so the house was practically empty.    The Judge's house is known as _Shahibagh_ and was a palace of the  Badshahs of old. At the foot of the wall supporting a broad terrace  flowed the thin summer stream of the Savarmati river along one edge of  its ample bed of sand. My brother used to go off to his court, and I  would be left all alone in the vast expanse of the palace, with only the  cooing of the pigeons to break the midday stillness; and an  unaccountable curiosity kept me wandering about the empty rooms.    Into the niches in the wall of a large chamber my brother had put his  books. One of these was a gorgeous edition of Tennyson's works, with big  print and numerous pictures. The book, for me, was as silent as the  palace, and, much in the same way I wandered among its picture plates.  Not that I could not make anything of the text, but it spoke to me more  like inarticulate cooings than words. In my brother's library I also  found a book of collected Sanskrit poems edited by Dr. Haberlin and  printed at the old Serampore press. This was also beyond my  understanding but the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#19)"],[1,"square. The sheik, after talking the matter over with Edgar, rode with  some of his followers to the spot where the leaders were discussing the  matter.    \"There is much in what you say,\" he exclaimed, when one of those who  urged delay had spoken; \"but if we are to await their attack let us  prepare for it. All who have firearms should go on to the roofs of the  houses of the streets through which they will march, and fire down into  them as they pass along. Those who have other arms should take their  places in the lanes, running out of them and break into the column as it  comes along, while we Arabs will charge them in front.\"    Some strongly approved of this advice, others said that the question  must be referred to the council at the mosque, and things remained as  they were before.    The French had made a move early. Soon after daybreak Captain Sulkouski,  one of Napoleon's aides-de-camp, started with two hundred cavalry to  make a circuit of the town, and to reconnoitre the position of the  insurgents. He rashly charged into the middle of a large party of Arabs,  but was killed with many of his men. Two hours later scouts rushed into  the cemetery, and announced that the French were in movement along the  streets leading towards it, and almost immediately afterwards several  batteries, which had been placed during the night on spots commanding  the cemetery, opened fire.    There was no hesitation now on the part of the insurgents; they rushed  forward in confused masses to meet the enemy. As they did so the leading  ranks of the columns opened, and cannon, which were being dragged along  by the infantry, poured volleys of grape into the crowded mobs. Many of  the Egyptians ran into the houses, and from there kept up a heavy fire.  But pressing steadily forward, the French fought their way into the  cemetery, and opening out, poured such heavy volleys into the Egyptians  that these speedily ran up the streets leading from it, leaving numbers  of dead behind. The Arabs had fallen back before the French entered the  square, as the crowded tombstones rendered it impossible for them to act  with any effect there, and the sheik's party, with several others, took  up their position at some distance up the principal street leading  towards the mosque.    As soon as a heavy French column entered this street fighting began in  earnest. From roof and window a deadly fire was poured into them, bodies  of men armed with sword and dagger rushed out of the narrow lanes and  threw themselves on the flanks of the column. Many French soldiers were  killed, but the bayonet did its work, and the assailants who had pierced  the column fell to a man.    The blood of the French soldiers was now up. The sudden attack upon  them, the killing of many of their comrades, and of several  distinguished officers who had been caught riding unguardedly through  the city, had exasperated them to a pitch of fury. They had been under  arms all night, and the sight of many shops gutted, and their late  inmates lying dead at their doorway or in the road, filled them with a  thirst for vengeance, and they moved forward eagerly.    \"Now it is our turn!\" one of the Arab sheiks said sternly, then raising  his war-cry he led the way down the street, followed by a hundred of his  followers. Behind them rode Ben Ouafy, with Sidi and Edgar beside him,  and his own band following closely. There was only room for eight men to  ride abreast. Although their front ranks were swept away by the fire of  the leading ranks of the French column, the Arabs charged with splendid  bravery, but when within twenty paces of the column there was a sudden  movement, the ranks opened, and two cannon loaded to the muzzle with  grape poured a murderous discharge into them.    The effect was terrible. The greater portion of the band that led the  charge was swept away; the others would have turned, but the Beni Ouafy  were racing forward. \"Charge,\" the sheik cried, \"before they can load  again!\"    \"Forward, forward!\" the Arabs' war-cry pealed out loud and shrill from a  hundred throats, and the whole then dashed down upon the French column.  The leading ranks were cut down, the cannon were for the moment  captured, and the Arabs pressed forward with shouts of victory; but the  French in front, pressed upon by those behind, could retreat but a short  distance. Those in front defended themselves with bayonet and clubbed  muskets, those behind poured their fire into the Arabs, who, being  raised above their comrades' heads, offered an easy mark.    The road was speedily blocked with fallen men and horses, but the  struggle continued until there was a movement from the French column,  and pressing their way along, a number of soldiers dragged two more guns  to the front. Then the head of the column opened sufficiently for the  muzzles to project between those of the first line, and again the storm  of grape swept the street. This was too much for the Arabs, and those  who survived turned their horses and galloped back. The sheik and his  party had just reached the French line, all in front of them having  fallen, when the cannon poured their contents down the street. Edgar had  caught sight of the guns just before, and uttered a warning shout.    \"To the right, sheik, to the right!\" while he himself, with a sharp pull  at the bridle, caused his horse to wheel to the left, and thus when the  guns were fired, their contents passed between Edgar and his two  friends. The sheik gave a cry of dismay as he saw that the greater part  of his followers were destroyed, and shouted to Sidi and Edgar to fly  for their lives. Riding at a mad gallop they dashed along, but the  bullets of the French pursued them vengefully, and half-way down the  street Edgar felt a sudden sharp pain in his right arm, and at the same  moment his horse gave a sudden spring and then rolled over. He was at  the time somewhat in rear of the sheik and Sidi, and they were for the  moment unaware of what happened to him. Fortunately the horse did not  fall upon him, and in an instant he was upon his feet again.    Looking round he saw that he had fallen close to the open door of a shop  with an Italian name over it; he ran into it. The shop had been  completely ransacked, and three bodies, those of the proprietor and two  lads, lay on the floor. There was no door leading out behind, and he ran  up the stairs. The rooms were littered with the remains of the furniture  and belongings. The bedding, curtains, and everything that could be of  use to the spoilers were gone, but the European clothes, which could not  be worn by them, were still about. The only windows looked into the  street. There was no apparent means of escape; the only hope was in  disguise. Tearing off his Arab garments and thrusting them into a  cupboard, he threw on without a moment's delay, trousers, a coat that  buttoned up, and a pair of European shoes, thrust a cap on his head, and  then ran downstairs again. Fortunately the column, after defeating its  assailants, had paused for two or three minutes, while the soldiers  broke into the houses from which they had been fired upon and slew all  they found in them, and its head was still a hundred yards away when  Edgar looked cautiously out. He had time to throw off his coat and to  hastily bandage the wound in his arm, from which the blood had been  streaming down; then as he heard the tramp of the advancing column he  ran down to the door, and as the troops came up, waved his hand, danced  as if for joy, and shouted a welcome in Italian, mingled with a few  words of French, pouring at the same time a voluble string of  maledictions on the ruffians who had killed his master and his two  comrades. A mounted officer riding at the head of the column shouted to  him to go in and to remain quiet, saying that there was no fear that he  would be molested now. Edgar drew back a little, but remained at the  door, sometimes shouting encouragement to the soldiers, sometimes  apparently weeping convulsively, and acting as if half out of his mind  with relief at his deliverance.    As soon as the column had passed he returned upstairs, bandaged his  wound much more carefully than before, put on a shirt, and chose the  best garments that he could find. All these had no doubt belonged to the  proprietor, and he now went boldly out and followed the French column.  These met with very slight resistance on their road towards the Mosque  of Gama El Ashar. When they neared this spot they halted until the other  columns should reach the point of attack. Before they had left the  square General Gonmartin had moved round from Boulak with ten guns and  taken post on the height near Fort Dupres, and at mid-day thirty guns  from this fort and the citadel opened fire on the town. As it was known  to the French that great numbers of the fugitives from the cemetery had  fled to the mosque, where already a strong body of armed men were  assembled, it was deemed imprudent to attack it until secure that there  was no danger of a great mass of the insurgents falling upon them while  so engaged.    Shells fell fast on the mosque, and fires broke out in several parts of  the town. Edgar joined a group of several civilians, who, having either  been hidden during the massacre or having escaped to the French lines,  now came up, deeming that they would be safer near the troops than  elsewhere. All had stories of hairbreadth escapes to relate, but,  feigning not to be able to follow their narratives, Edgar, after a few  words in Italian, joined the troops, who were engaged in eating the food  that they had brought with them.    At three o'clock a tremendous roar of fire in the direction of Fort  Dupres burst out, as some seven or eight thousand of the insurgents,  among whom were a number of Arabs, poured out from the nearest gate to  endeavour to carry the battery, while at the same moment a tremendous  musketry fire"]]]
