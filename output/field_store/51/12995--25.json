He had given that up, and now  cultivated fruit and vegetables for the market, and his wife bred and  fattened poultry and rabbits for sale. After awhile it seemed to me that  my oats came very short; I had the beans, but bran was mixed with them  instead of oats, of which there were very few; certainly not more than a  quarter of what there should have been. In two or three weeks this began  to tell upon my strength and spirits. The grass food, though very good,  was not the thing to keep up my condition without corn. However, I  could not complain, nor make known my wants. So it went on for about two  months; and I wondered that my master did not see that something was  the matter. However, one afternoon he rode out into the country to see a  friend of his, a gentleman farmer, who lived on the road to Wells.    This gentleman had a very quick eye for horses; and after he had  welcomed his friend he said, casting his eye over me:    \"It seems to me, Barry, that your horse does not look so well as he did  when you first had him; has he been well?\"    \"Yes, I believe so,\" said my master; \"but he is not nearly so lively as  he was; my groom tells me that horses are always dull and weak in the  autumn, and that I must expect it.\"    \"Autumn, fiddlesticks!\" said the farmer. \"Why, this is only August; and  with your light work and good food he ought not to go down like this,  even if it was autumn. How do you feed him?\"    My master told him. The other shook his head slowly, and began to feel  me over.    \"I can't say who eats your corn, my dear fellow, but I am much mistaken  if your horse gets it. Have you ridden very fast?\"    \"No, very gently.\"    \"Then just put your hand here,\" said he, passing his hand over my neck  and shoulder; \"he is as warm and damp as a horse just come up from  grass. I advise you to look into your stable a little more. I hate to be  suspicious, and, thank heaven, I have no cause to be, for I can trust my  men, present or absent; but there are mean scoundrels, wicked enough to  rob a dumb beast of his food. You must look into it.\" And turning to  his man, who had come to take me, \"Give this horse a right good feed of  bruised oats, and don't stint him.\"    \"Dumb beasts!\" Yes, we are; but if I could have spoken I could have told  my master where his oats went to. My groom used to come every morning  about six o'clock, and with him a little boy, who always had a covered  basket with him. He used to go with his father into the harness-room,  where the corn was kept, and I could see them, when the door stood ajar,  fill a little bag with oats out of the bin, and then he used to be off.    Five or six mornings after this, just as the boy had left the stable,  the door was pushed open, and a policeman walked in, holding the child  tight by the arm; another policeman followed, and locked the door on the  inside, saying, \"Show me the place where your father keeps his rabbits'  food.\"    The boy looked very frightened and began to cry; but there was no  escape, and he led the way to the corn-bin. Here the policeman found  another empty bag like that which was found full of oats in the boy's  basket.    Filcher was cleaning my feet at the time, but they soon saw him, and  though he blustered a good deal they walked him off to the \"lock-up\",  and his boy with him. I heard afterward that the boy was not held to be  guilty, but the man was sentenced to prison for two months.          31 A Humbug      My master was not immediately suited, but in a few days my new groom  came. He was a tall, good-looking fellow enough; but if ever there was  a humbug in the shape of a groom Alfred Smirk was the man. He was very  civil to me, and never used me ill; in fact, he did a great deal of  stroking and patting when his master was there to see it. He always  brushed my mane and tail with water and my hoofs with oil before he  brought me to the door, to make me look smart; but as to cleaning my  feet or looking to my shoes, or grooming me thoroughly, he thought no  more of that than if I had been a cow. He left my bit rusty, my saddle  damp, and my crupper stiff.    Alfred Smirk considered himself very handsome; he spent a great deal of  time about his hair, whiskers and necktie, before a little looking-glass  in the harness-room. When his master was speaking to him it was always,  \"Yes, sir; yes, sir\"--touching his hat at every word; and every one  thought he was a very nice young man and that Mr. Barry was very  fortunate to meet with him. I should say he was the laziest, most  conceited fellow I ever came near. Of course, it was a great thing not  to be ill-used, but then a horse wants more than that. I had a loose  box, and might have been very comfortable if he had not been too  indolent to clean it out. He never took all the straw away, and the  smell from what lay underneath was very bad; while the strong vapors  that rose made my eyes smart and inflame, and I did not feel the same  appetite for my food.    One day his master came in and said, \"Alfred, the stable smells rather  strong; should not you give that stall a good scrub and throw down  plenty of water?\"    \"Well, sir,\" he said, touching his cap, \"I'll do so if you please, sir;  but it is rather dangerous, sir, throwing down water in a horse's box;  they are very apt to take cold, sir. I should not like to do him an  injury, but I'll do it if you please, sir.\"    \"Well,\" said his master, \"I should not like him to take cold; but I  don't like the smell of this stable. Do you think the drains are all  right?\"    \"Well, sir, now you mention it, I think the drain does sometimes send  back a smell; there may be something wrong, sir.\"    \"Then send for the bricklayer and have it seen to,\" said his master.    \"Yes, sir, I will.\"    The bricklayer came and pulled up a great many bricks, but found nothing  amiss; so he put down some lime and charged the master five shillings,  and the smell in my box was as bad as ever. But that was not all:  standing as I did on a quantity of moist straw my feet grew unhealthy  and tender, and the master used to say:    \"I don't know what is the matter with this horse; he goes very  fumble-footed. I am sometimes afraid he will stumble.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Alfred, \"I have noticed the same myself, when I have  exercised him.\"    Now the fact was that he hardly ever did exercise me, and when the  master was busy I often stood for days together without stretching my  legs at all, and yet being fed just as high as if I were at hard work.  This often disordered my health, and made me sometimes heavy and dull,  but more often restless and feverish. He never even gave me a meal  of green food or a bran mash, which would have cooled me, for he  was altogether as ignorant as he was conceited; and then, instead of  exercise or change of food, I had to take horse balls and draughts;  which, beside the nuisance of having them poured down my throat, used to  make me feel ill and uncomfortable.    One day my feet were so tender that, trotting over some fresh stones  with my master on my back, I made two such serious stumbles that, as he  came down Lansdown into the city, he stopped at the farrier's, and asked  him to see what was the matter with me. The man took up my feet one  by one and examined them; then standing up and dusting his hands one  against the other, he said:    \"Your horse has got the 'thrush', and badly, too; his feet are very  tender; it is fortunate that he has not been down. I wonder your groom  has not seen to it before. This is the sort of thing we find in foul  stables, where the litter is never properly cleaned out. If you will  send him here to-morrow I will attend to the hoof, and I will direct  your man how to apply the liniment which I will give him.\"    The next day I had my feet thoroughly cleansed and stuffed with tow  soaked in some strong lotion; and an unpleasant business it was.    The farrier ordered all the litter to be taken out of my box day by day,  and the floor kept very clean. Then I was to have bran mashes, a little  green food, and not so much corn, till my feet were well again. With  this treatment I soon regained my spirits; but Mr. Barry was so much  disgusted at being twice deceived by his grooms that he determined to  give up keeping a horse, and to hire when he wanted one. I was therefore  kept till my feet were quite sound, and was then sold again.          Part III          32 A Horse Fair      No doubt a horse fair is a very amusing place to those who have nothing  to lose; at any rate, there is plenty to see.    Long strings of young horses out of the country, fresh from the marshes;  and droves of shaggy little Welsh ponies, no higher than Merrylegs; and  hundreds of cart horses of all sorts, some of them with their long tails  braided up and tied with scarlet cord; and a good many like myself,  handsome and high-bred, but fallen into the middle class, through some  accident or blemish, unsoundness of wind, or some other complaint. There  were some splendid animals quite in their prime, and fit for anything;  they were throwing out their legs and showing off their paces in high  style, as they were trotted out with a leading rein, the groom running  by the side. But round in the background there were a number of poor  things, sadly broken down with hard work, with their knees knuckling  over and their hind legs swinging out at every step, and there were some  very dejected-looking old horses, with the under lip hanging down and  the ears lying back heavily, as if there were no more pleasure in life,  and no more hope; there were some so thin you might see all their ribs,  and some with old sores on their backs and hips. These were sad sights  for a horse to look upon, who knows not but he may come to the same  state.    There was a great deal of bargaining, of running up and beating down;  and if a horse may speak his mind so far as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#19)"],[1,"Buckingham's friends with the latest news  about him. This was a direct answer to the coldness with which Madame  had received him. The attack was a vigorous one, and Madame felt the  blow, but without appearing to have even noticed it. He rapidly cast a  glance at Monsieur and at De Guiche,--the former colored, and the latter  turned very pale. Madame alone preserved an unmoved countenance; but,  as she knew how many unpleasant thoughts and feelings her enemy could  awaken in the two persons who were listening to him, she smilingly  bent forward towards the traveler, as if to listen to the news he had  brought--but he was speaking of other matters. Madame was brave, even to  imprudence; if she were to retreat, it would be inviting an attack; so,  after the first disagreeable impression had passed away, she returned to  the charge.    \"Have you suffered much from your wounds, Monsieur de Wardes?\" she  inquired, \"for we have been told that you had the misfortune to get  wounded.\"    It was now De Wardes's turn to wince; he bit his lips, and replied, \"No,  Madame, hardly at all.\"    \"Indeed! and yet in this terribly hot weather--\"    \"The sea-breezes were very fresh and cool, Madame, and then I had one  consolation.\"    \"Indeed! What was it?\"    \"The knowledge that my adversary's sufferings were still greater than my  own.\"    \"Ah! you mean he was more seriously wounded than you were; I was not  aware of that,\" said the princess, with utter indifference.    \"Oh, Madame, you are mistaken, or rather you pretend to misunderstand  my remark. I did not say that he was a greater sufferer in body than  myself; but his heart was very seriously affected.\"    De Guiche comprehended instinctively from what direction the struggle  was approaching; he ventured to make a sign to Madame, as if entreating  her to retire from the contest. But she, without acknowledging De  Guiche's gesture, without pretending to have noticed it even, and still  smiling, continued:    \"Is it possible,\" she said, \"that the Duke of Buckingham's heart was  touched? I had no idea, until now, that a heart-wound could be cured.\"    \"Alas! Madame,\" replied De Wardes, politely, \"every woman believes that;  and it is this belief that gives them that superiority to man which  confidence begets.\"    \"You misunderstand altogether, dearest,\" said the prince, impatiently;  \"M. de Wardes means that the Duke of Buckingham's heart had been  touched, not by the sword, but by something sharper.\"    \"Ah! very good, very good!\" exclaimed Madame. \"It is a jest of M. de  Wardes's. Very good; but I should like to know if the Duke of Buckingham  would appreciate the jest. It is, indeed, a very great pity he is not  here, M. de Wardes.\"    The young man's eyes seemed to flash fire. \"Oh!\" he said, as he clenched  his teeth, \"there is nothing I should like better.\"    De Guiche did not move. Madame seemed to expect that he would come to  her assistance. Monsieur hesitated. The Chevalier de Lorraine advanced  and continued the conversation.    \"Madame,\" he said, \"De Wardes knows perfectly well that for a  Buckingham's heart to be touched is nothing new, and what he has said  has already taken place.\"    \"Instead of an ally, I have two enemies,\" murmured Madame; \"two  determined enemies, and in league with each other.\" And she changed the  conversation. To change the conversation is, as every one knows, a  right possessed by princes which etiquette requires all to respect. The  remainder of the conversation was moderate enough in tone; the principal  actors had rehearsed their parts. Madame withdrew easily, and Monsieur,  who wished to question her on several matters, offered her his hand on  leaving. The chevalier was seriously afraid that an understanding might  be established between the husband and wife if he were to leave them  quietly together. He therefore made his way to Monsieur's apartments, in  order to surprise him on his return, and to destroy with a few words all  the good impressions Madame might have been able to sow in his heart. De  Guiche advanced towards De Wardes, who was surrounded by a large number  of persons, and thereby indicated his wish to converse with him; De  Wardes, at the same time, showing by his looks and by a movement of his  head that he perfectly understood him. There was nothing in these signs  to enable strangers to suppose they were otherwise than upon the most  friendly footing. De Guiche could therefore turn away from him, and wait  until he was at liberty. He had not long to wait; for De Wardes,  freed from his questioners, approached De Guiche, and after a fresh  salutation, they walked side by side together.    \"You have made a good impression since your return, my dear De Wardes,\"  said the comte.    \"Excellent, as you see.\"    \"And your spirits are just as lively as ever?\"    \"Better.\"    \"And a very great happiness, too.\"    \"Why not? Everything is so ridiculous in this world, everything so  absurd around us.\"    \"You are right.\"    \"You are of my opinion, then?\"    \"I should think so! And what news do you bring us from yonder?\"    \"I? None at all. I have come to look for news here.\"    \"But, tell me, you surely must have seen some people at Boulogne, one of  our friends, for instance; it is no great time ago.\"    \"Some people--one of our friends--\"    \"Your memory is short.\"    \"Ah! true; Bragelonne, you mean.\"    \"Exactly so.\"    \"Who was on his way to fulfil a mission, with which he was intrusted to  King Charles II.\"    \"Precisely. Well, then, did he not tell you, or did not you tell him--\"    \"I do not precisely know what I told him, I must confess: but I do know  what I did _not_ tell him.\" De Wardes was _finesse_ itself. He  perfectly well knew from De Guiche's tone and manner, which was cold  and dignified, that the conversation was about to assume a disagreeable  turn. He resolved to let it take what course it pleased, and to keep  strictly on his guard.    \"May I ask you what you did not tell him?\" inquired De Guiche.    \"All about La Valliere.\"    \"La Valliere... What is it? and what was that strange circumstance you  seem to have known over yonder, which Bragelonne, who was here on the  spot, was not acquainted with?\"    \"Do you really ask me that in a serious manner?\"    \"Nothing more so.\"    \"What! you, a member of the court, living in Madame's household, a  friend of Monsieur's, a guest at their table, the favorite of our lovely  princess?\"    Guiche colored violently from anger. \"What princess are you alluding  to?\" he said.    \"I am only acquainted with one, my dear fellow. I am speaking of Madame  herself. Are you devoted to another princess, then? Come, tell me.\"    De Guiche was on the point of launching out, but he saw the drift of  the remark. A quarrel was imminent between the two young men. De Wardes  wished the quarrel to be only in Madame's name, while De Guiche would  not accept it except on La Valliere's account. From this moment, it  became a series of feigned attacks, which would have continued until one  of the two had been touched home. De Guiche therefore resumed all the  self-possession he could command.    \"There is not the slightest question in the world of Madame in this  matter, my dear De Wardes.\" said Guiche, \"but simply of what you were  talking about just now.\"    \"What was I saying?\"    \"That you had concealed certain things from Bragelonne.\"    \"Certain things which you know as well as I do,\" replied De Wardes.    \"No, upon my honor.\"    \"Nonsense.\"    \"If you tell me what they are, I shall know, but not otherwise, I  swear.\"    \"What! I who have just arrived from a distance of sixty leagues, and you  who have not stirred from this place, who have witnessed with your  own eyes that which rumor informed me of at Calais! Do you now tell  me seriously that you do not know what it is about? Oh! comte, this is  hardly charitable of you.\"    \"As you like, De Wardes; but I again repeat, I know nothing.\"    \"You are truly discreet--well!--perhaps it is very prudent of you.\"    \"And so you will not tell me anything, will not tell me any more than  you told Bragelonne?\"    \"You are pretending to be deaf, I see. I am convinced that Madame could  not possibly have more command over herself than _you_ have.\"    \"Double hypocrite,\" murmured Guiche to himself, \"you are again returning  to the old subject.\"    \"Very well, then,\" continued De Wardes, \"since we find it so difficult  to understand each other about La Valliere and Bragelonne let us speak  about your own affairs.\"    \"Nay,\" said De Guiche, \"I have no affairs of my own to talk about. You  have not said anything about me, I suppose, to Bragelonne, which you  cannot repeat to my face?\"    \"No; but understand me, Guiche, that however much I may be ignorant of  certain matters, I am quite as conversant with others. If, for instance,  we were conversing about the intimacies of the Duke of Buckingham at  Paris, as I did during my journey with the duke, I could tell you a  great many interesting circumstances. Would you like me to mention  them?\"    De Guiche passed his hand across his forehead, which was covered  in perspiration. \"No, no,\" he said, \"a hundred times no! I have no  curiosity for matters which do not concern me. The Duke of Buckingham  is for me nothing more than a simple acquaintance, whilst Raoul is  an intimate friend. I have not the slightest curiosity to learn what  happened to the duke, while I have, on the contrary, the greatest  interest in all that happened to Raoul.\"    \"In Paris?\"    \"Yes, in Paris, or Boulogne. You understand I am on the spot; if  anything should happen, I am here to meet it; whilst Raoul is absent,  and has only myself to represent him; so, Raoul's affairs before my  own.\"    \"But he will return?\"    \"Not, however, until his mission is completed. In the meantime, you  understand, evil reports cannot be permitted to circulate about him  without my looking into them.\"    \"And for a better reason still, "]]]
