At last they huddled into their clothes, hurried  back to the bunkhouse. Bartolome was there waiting for them.    \"You Tejanos--\" There was no pretense of friendliness in his hail. \"The  _patron_ will see you, pronto!\"    They went, tugging their clothing into order as they paused outside the  door. Drew rapped, took the sound from within as an invitation, and pushed  aside the heavy oak planks.    Outwardly the room was unchanged. No one had moved those old Spanish  chests, the skin rugs, the table, since his last visit there. But he had  the feeling that it was chill now, cold, as if a hearth fire had been  allowed to die into ashes. Perhaps that thought crossed his mind because  Hunt Rennie stood by the fireplace moving the toe of his boot back and  forth across a smear of gray powder. His back greeted them unwelcomingly,  and the silence lengthened uncomfortably until Drew did as he always had  and met the unpleasant head-on.    \"You wanted us, suh?\" It was like being back in the army. Even his arm  twitched as if some muscle was activated by memory to make one of those  informal military salutes the scouts favored.    Hunt Rennie did turn now. His eyes leveled on them. In the light of the  candles his cheeks looked even more hollow tonight, and he moved stiffly  as might a man who was not only bone-tired in body, thought Drew, but  weary in mind as well.    \"You are Anson Kirby?\" he addressed the Texan first.    \"Yes, suh.\" Anse, too, must be caught up in the same web of memory. That  was his old report-to-the-commanding-officer voice.    \"I understand you two thought it necessary to take on some troopers in the  Jacks.\"    What was the proper reply to that? Drew wondered. Probably it was best to  follow the old army rule of keep the mouth shut, never volunteer, no  explanations. If Hunt Rennie had had the story from Topham or Nye, he  already knew how the fight began.    \"I won't have troublemakers on the Range.\" Now the voice, too, was tired.  The youthfulness which had impressed Drew on their initial meeting had  drained from this man tonight. He was taut as if pulled harp-string tight  inside. Drew knew that feeling also. But what battle had Rennie emerged  from--some struggle with Shannon or Bayliss?    Then the words made sense, penetrating his concern for the man who had  said them. Well, this dismissal only matched his gloomiest expectations.    \"Can't any of you young fools get it through your thick heads that the  war's over? Saloon brawling with the army ain't going to change that.  It'll only get you into worse difficulties around here.\"    A spark of protest awoke inside Drew. Rennie was reading this all wrong.  He and Anse certainly hadn't been trying to wipe away the bitter taste of  Gainesville by jumping some blue coats in a cantina hundreds of miles and  more than a year away from where they had been forced to admit, at last,  that bulletless carbines and bare feet could not keep on shooting and  marching.    \"Must have been mistaken about you, Kirby.\" Now Rennie looked at Drew.    The Kentuckian met those dark eyes squarely, his first unvoiced protest  stiffening into defiance. But he faced the older man steadily. Anse,  watching them both, drew a small, fast breath. Good thing for Drew there  were no other witnesses now; the likeness between the two Rennies was  unmistakable at this moment.    Hunt Rennie did not follow up his half accusation. He appeared to be  expecting some reply. What? A childish promise to be a good boy, not to do  it again? Drew's half-unconscious concern for this man burned away  speedily, ignited by what he deemed injustice.    Anse broke the too long silence. \"I don't know what you heard 'bout that  there fight, suh,\" he drawled. \"Can't see as how we could have done no  different nohow. But that's no call to saddle it all on Drew. Me, I had a  hand--two fists--in it, too. An' if that's what's th' matter, I can pull  out----\"    \"No!\" Drew's hand came up in the old gesture to stop the line of march.  \"We'll both ride, Mr. Rennie. We don't aim to argue the matter any.  Only--there's one thing--I brought Shadow and the filly down with the wagon  train. The foal's too young to trail on now. They're blooded stock. I've  papers for them. I'll sell....\"    He loathed saying every word of that. It was not only the thought of  giving up Shadow and the foal, though he knew that would cut with a deeper  hurt every day. It was having to ask any kind of favor from this man. Not  that such a sale was a favor; Rennie ought to be glad to get such blood  for the Range.    \"You ain't goin' to do that!\" Anse was stung into angry protest.    But Drew was unaware of the Texan's outburst, his entire attention for  Hunt Rennie. The tall man came over to the table, moved one of the  candelabra forward as if to throw more light on Drew.    \"That your choice of solutions, boy--to run?\"    Drew flushed. The unfairness of that jab pushed him off balance. What  _did_ this man want of him anyway? Rennie had said it plain that he did  not want Drew and Anse on the Range.    \"Running never settled anything.\" Rennie's fingers traced the spread of  the candelabra's arms. \"Neither does jumping to conclusions. Has anyone  said you were through here, unless by your own choice?\"    Drew was jarred into an answer. \"You said----\"    Rennie sighed. \"Do any of you young fire-eaters ever listen to more than  one tenth of what any of your elders say? I _am_ saying and making it  plain: If you make a steady practice of trading punches with a trooper or  with any one else because you take a dislike to his face, the way his ears  stick out, how he walks or talks, or what color coat he wore in the war,  then you can roll your beds and ride out--the sooner the better.    \"Reese Topham tells me that he explained the local situation to you, and  you appeared to understand it then. Any difficulty with the army could  have serious consequences, not just for you, but for the Range as well.  This time you were not the aggressors. But after being forewarned, if it  happens again, I'll be hard to convince that you were in the right. The  war's over--keep on remembering that. This is new country where it doesn't,  or shouldn't, matter whether a man wore a blue coat or marched under the  Stars and Bars. You're far too young to let the past cut off the future.  Wars can finish a whole way of life for a man....\" His eyes no longer held  Drew's; he was looking beyond toward the half-open door or perhaps at  something that he alone could see. \"You have to learn to throw away broken  things, not cherish them. Never look back!\" That dry, tired voice took on  a fierce intensity. Then he was back with them again.    \"Two Kirbys riding for the same spread is going to be rather confusing.  You are Drew, and you are Anson--Anson--\" He repeated the name. \"What part  of Texas are you from?\"    \"Pa had him a spread down near th' San Sabe 'fore th' Comanches came. He  was Anson, too--in th' Rangers for a while, Pa was.\"    \"Tall man, with a lot of freckles and red hair? Best rider in Miggs'  Company----\" It was half question, half assertion.    \"You knew Pa!\" Anse shouldered past Drew. \"That was Pa right enough. He  rode with Lieutenant Miggs in the Mex War.\"    Hunt Rennie was smiling. Once more years spun away from him. \"I ought to  know him, son. He toted me across his saddle for a mighty long five miles  on a blistering hot day, I having as much to say about the matter as a  sack of corn, and being three times as heavy in spite of a starvation  diet. Yes, I'll remember Anson Kirby. He and his squad were the first  Americans I ran into after I broke out of a filthy prison. Funny  though\"--he glanced at Drew--\"I don't remember his mentioning a brother. You  _are_ his nephew?\"    Anse was quick to the rescue. \"Pa--he an' Drew's Pa--they weren't too close.  Drew's Pa was town folks. He sent Drew to Kaintuck for schoolin'. Pa, he  favored th' range an' th' free land west--\"    Rennie nodded. \"Well, Anson, if you're as good a rider as your father, we  can use you here. Horse knowledge seems to run in your family. Now,  shortly we are expecting a _Coronel_ Luis Oliveri who's to buy horses for  the Juarez forces. He may need some assistance in driving them as far as  the border. If he does, both of you'll go.\"    \"Yes, suh.\"    Drew's agreement was drowned out by a harsh cry from overhead. Rennie went  into action, so swiftly that for a startled moment Drew was left gaping at  empty space. _Don_ Cazar had caught up one of the rifles from under a  window and had crossed the doorway to look back at the roof of the Casa  Grande, calling out an inquiry in another language.    \"Apaches don't attack at night!\" Drew was heading for the door in turn.    \"Outlaws do, when it pays,\" Anse shot out grimly.    But on a second hail from the rooftop sentry post Rennie swung the rifle  over his arm and faced the outer gate of the patio.    \"Unbar, Francisco!\" he called in Spanish.    One leaf of the massive door folded back to allow in a small party of  horsemen. One saddled but riderless mount galloped along with the rest.  Another man held to the high horn with both hands and weaved back and  forth while a comrade riding beside him strove to keep him from toppling  to the ground. Drew had an impression of bright, almost gaudy uniforms.  The men of the Stronghold poured out to take the horses, helping down more  than one blood-stained soldier. Their leader, a slender man with dusty  gold lace banding his high collar, came directly to Rennie.    \"_Don_ Cazar.\" His Spanish was a flood in which Drew was lost almost  immediately, but Anse listened with parted lips and then translated a  quick account.    \"This here's th' _Coronel_. He an' his men was bushwhacked. Got away  'cause they met th' wagon train goin' south an' whoever was eatin' their  dust huntin' them didn't seem "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#19)"],[1,"-heads, and brads or finishing nails. Flat-heads are  used in ordinary work, where the heads are not to be sunk in the wood  or \"set.\"    Some nails get their names from their special uses; as, shingle-nails,  trunk-nails, boat-nails, lath-nails, picture-nails, barrel-nails, etc.    The size of nails is indicated by the length in inches, and by the  size of the wire for wire nails. The old nomenclature for cut nails  also survives, in which certain numbers are prefixed to \"penny.\" For  example, a threepenny nail is 1-1/4\" long, a fourpenny nail is 1-1/2\"  long, a fivepenny nail is 1-3/4\" long, a sixpenny nail is 2\" long. In  other words, from threepenny to tenpenny 1/4\" is added for each penny,  but a twelvepenny nail is 3-1/4\" long, a sixteenpenny nail is 3-1/2\"  long, a twentypenny nail is 4\" long. This is explained as meaning  that \"tenpenny\" nails, for example, cost tenpence a hundred. Another  explanation is that originally 1000 of such nails weighed a pound. The  size of cut nails is usually still so indicated. Nails are sold by the  pound.    The advantages of nails are that they are quickly and easily applied,  they are strong and cheap, and the work can be separated, tho with  difficulty. The disadvantages are the appearance and, in some cases,  the insecurity.    The holding power of nails may be increased by driving them into the  wood at other than a right angle, especially where several nails unite  two pieces of wood. By driving some at one inclination and some at  another, they bind the pieces of wood together with much greater force  than when driven in straight.    The term brads was once confined to small finishing nails, but is  now used for all finishing nails, in distinction from common or  flat-headed nails. The heads are made round instead of flat so that  they may be set easily with a nailset and the hole filled with a plug,  or, where the wood is to be painted, with putty. They are used for  interior finishing and other nice work.    [Illustration: Fig. 227. Tack.]    _Tacks_, Fig. 227, vary in size and shape according to their use; as,  flat-headed, gimp, round-headed, and double-pointed or matting tacks,  a sort of small staple. Their size is indicated by the word \"ounce.\"  For example, a two-ounce tack is 1/4\" long, a three-ounce tack is 3/8\"  long, a four-ounce tack is 7/16\" long, a six-ounce tack is 1/2\" long,  etc. This term once meant the number of ounces of iron required to  make 1000 tacks.    Tacks are useful only in fastening to wood thin material, such as  veneers, textiles, leather, matting, tin, etc. Tinner's tacks, which  are used for clinching, are commonly called clinch-nails. Wire tacks,  altho made, are not so successful as cut tacks because they lack a  sharp point, which is essential.    [Illustration: Fig. 228. Corrugated Fastener.]    _Corrugated fasteners_, Fig. 228, or fluted nails, are used to fasten  together two pieces of wood by driving the fastener so that one-half  of it will be on each side of the joint. Their size is indicated by  the length and the number of corrugations, as 1/2\", four. They are  often useful where nails are impracticable.    _Glaziers' points_ are small, triangular pieces of zinc, used to  fasten glass into sashes.      SCREWS    (a) _Wood-screws_, Fig. 229, may be classified by the material of  which they are made; as, steel or brass. Steel screws may be either  bright,--the common finish,--blued by heat or acid to hinder rusting,  tinned, or bronzed. Brass screws are essential wherever rust would be  detrimental, as in boats.    (b) Screws are also classified by shape; as, flat-headed,  round-headed, fillister-headed, oval-countersunk-headed, and  square-headed screws. Flat-heads are most commonly used. There are  also special shapes for particular purposes. Round-heads may be used  either for decoration or where great drawing power is desirable. In  the latter case, washers are commonly inserted under the heads  to prevent them from sinking into the wood. Oval-heads are used  decoratively, the head filling the countersunk hole, as with  flat-heads, and projecting a trifle besides. They are much used in  the interior finish of railway cars. They are suitable for the strap  hinges of a chest.    The thread of the screw begins in a fine point so that it may  penetrate the wood easily where no hole has been bored as is often the  case in soft wood. The thread extends about two-thirds the length of  the screw. Any longer thread would only weaken the screw where it most  needs strength, near the head, and it does not need friction with the  piece thru which it passes.    The size of screws is indicated by their length in inches, and by  the diameter of the wire from which they are made, using the standard  screw-gage, Fig. 220, p. 117. They vary in size from No. 0 (less than  1/16\") to No. 30 (more than 7/16\") in diameter, and in length from  1/4\" to 6\".    [Illustration: Fig. 229. a. Flat-head Wood-screw. b. Round-head  Wood-screw. c. Fillister-head Wood-screw. d. Oval-countersunk-head  Wood-screw. e. Drive-screw. f. Square-head (lag- or coach-) Screw.]    The following is a good general rule for the use of screws: make the  hole in the piece thru which the screw passes, large enough for the  screw to slip thru easily. Countersink this hole enough to allow the  head to sink flush with the surface. Make the hole in the piece into  which the screw goes small enough for the thread of the screw to catch  tight. Then all the strength exerted in driving, goes toward drawing  the pieces together, not in overcoming friction. The hole must be deep  enough, especially in hard wood and for brass screws, to prevent the  possibility of twisting off and breaking the screw. Soap is often  useful as a lubricant to facilitate the driving of screws. Where it is  desirable that the heads do not show, a hole may first be bored with  an auger-bit large enough to receive the head and deep enough to  insert a plug of wood, which is cut out with a plug-cutter, Fig. 131,  p. 84, and glued in place. If pains are taken to match the grain, the  scar thus formed is inconspicuous.    In rough work, the screw may be driven into place with a hammer  thru most of its length, and then a few final turns be given with a  screwdriver, but this breaks the fibers of the wood and weakens their  hold. In \"drive-screws,\" Fig. 229, e, the slot is not cut all the way  across the head, in order that the blows of the hammer may not close  the slot.    The advantages of screws are, that they are very strong and that  the work can easily be taken apart. If they loosen they can be  retightened. The disadvantages are, that they are expensive, that they  take time to insert, that they show very plainly, and that they do not  hold well in end grain.      BOLTS    Bolts with nuts are useful where great strength is desired. There are  three chief varieties, Fig. 230.    [Illustration: Fig. 230. a. Stove-bolt. b. Carriage-bolt. c.  Machine-bolt.]    _Stove-bolts_ are cheaply made (cast) bolts having either flat or  round heads with a slot for the screwdriver, like ordinary screws.    _Carriage-bolts_ are distinguished by having the part of the shank  which is near the head, square.    _Machine-bolts_ have square, hexagonal, or button heads.    _Machine-screws_, Fig. 231, are similar to stove-bolts, but are  accurately cut and are measured with a screw-gage. The varieties  are, _a_, flat-head, _b_, round-head, _c_, fillister-head, _d_,  oval-countersunk-head, all with slots for screwdriver.    _Plates_, Fig. 232, include corner-irons, straight plates and  panel-irons. These are made of either iron or brass and are used in  fastening legs to the floor, in stiffening joints, affixing tops, etc.    _Dowel-rods._ Dowel-rods are cylindrical rods, from 3/16\" to 1\" in  diameter, and 36\", 42\", and 48\" long. They are commonly made of birch  or maple, but maple is more satisfactory as it shrinks less and is  stronger than birch.    Dowels are used as pins for joining boards edge to edge, and as a  substitute for mortise-and-tenon joints.    [Illustration: Fig. 231. Machine-screws. a. Flat-head. b. Round-head.  c. Fillister-head. d. Oval-countersunk-head.]    There is, to be sure, a prejudice against dowels on the part of  cabinet-makers due, possibly, to the willingness to have it appear  that doweling is a device of inferior mechanics. But doweling is  cheaper and quicker than tenoning, and there are many places in wood  construction where it is just as satisfactory and, if properly done,  just as strong. Certain parts of even the best furniture are so put  together.    Shoe pegs serve well as small dowels. They are dipped in glue and  driven into brad-awl holes.    [Illustration: Fig. 232. a. Corner-iron. b. Straight plate. c.  Panel-iron.]    _Wedges_ are commonly used in door construction between the edges of  tenons and the insides of mortises which are slightly beveled, No. 34,  Fig. 266, p. 179. Or the end of a tenon may be split to receive the  wedges, No. 35, Fig. 266. The blind wedge is used in the fox-tail  joint, No. 36, Fig. 266.      GLUE    Glue is an inferior kind of gelatin, and is of two kinds,--animal glue  and fish glue. Animal glue is made of bones and trimmings, cuttings  and fleshings from hides and skins of animals. Sinews, feet, tails,  snouts, ears, and horn pith are also largely used. Cattle, calves,  goats, pigs, horses, and rabbits, all yield characteristic glues.    The best glue is made from hides of oxen, which are soaked in lime  water until fatty or partly decayed matter is eaten out and only the  glue is left. The product is cleaned, boiled down and dried.    The best and clearest bone glues are obtained by leaching the bones  with dilute acid which dissolves out the lime salts and leaves the  gelatinous matters. Such leached bone is sold as a glue stock, under  the name of \"osseine.\" This material together with hides, sinews,  etc., has the gelatin or glue"]]]
