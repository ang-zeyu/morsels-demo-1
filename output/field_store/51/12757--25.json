Near the cliff this is  covered by sand dunes and piles of broken rock; farther out there is a  more level area covered thinly with sand and soil, and here there is a  large ruin of the old obliterated type already described (page 93).      [Illustration: Plate LIII    Cliff Outlook in Lower Canyon De Chelly]    Near the edges the rock becomes bare again, and is 20 to 30 feet high,  descending sheer or with an overhang to the bottoms or to the stream  bed. On the western side, facing north, the ruin illustrated occurs. It  is a mere cubby hole, and was evidently located for the area of  cultivable land which lies before it, and which it almost completely  commands. The cavity is about 12 feet above the ground and appears to  have been divided by cross walls into three rooms, two of which were  quite small. The back room was small, dark, and not large enough to  contain a human body unless it was carefully packed in, and at various  points along the back wall there are seeps of water. The interior of the  little room was very wet and moldy at the time when it was examined, in  winter, but in the summer time is probably dry enough.      [Illustration: Fig. 58--Ground plan of outlooks in a cleft.]    The masonry is fair and the surface is finished with plaster. The open  space in front of the small back room and the outer wall of the room  itself are much blackened by smoke, as though the inhabitant lived here  and used the small room only to store his utensils and implements. A  small room on the east must have been used for a similar purpose. Both  of these rooms were entered through narrow doorways opening on the  principal space. The site is an ideal one for a lookout, but not well  suited for a habitation. Plate LIV shows its character.      [Illustration: Fig. 59--Plan of a single-room outlook.]    Cliff outlooks are often found on sites whose restricted areas preclude  all possibility that they formed parts of larger settlements since  obliterated. The ruin just described is an example. Another instance  which occurs in Del Muerto is shown in figure 58. Here a deep cleft in  the rock was partly occupied by two or three rooms. There was room for  more, but apparently no more were built. There was not room, however,  for even a small village. There are several other examples in the canyon  almost identical with these, but this type is not nearly so abundant as  the succeeding. Figure 59 is a plan of a ruin near the mouth of Del  Muerto. It was a single room, situated on a ledge perhaps 30 or 40 feet  above the bottom land which it overlooked and of easy access. This is  the most common type of outlook or cliff ruin, and it might almost be  said that they number hundreds, sometimes consisting of one room alone,  sometimes of two or even three The general appearance of these outlooks  is shown in figure 60, which shows an example containing three rooms.      [Illustration: Fig. 60--Three-room outlook in Canyon del Muerto.]      [Illustration: Fig. 61--Plan of a two-room outlook.]    Figure 61 is a ground plan of an example containing two rooms, which  occurs below the large ruin described before (No. 31, page 119), and  figure 62 shows an example with one room, obscured and built over with  Navaho cists. This site is located in the upper part of the canyon, on  top of the talus, about 100 feet above the stream, and commands an  outlook over several areas of bottom land on both sides. The walls are  built about 10 feet high, and are composed of medium-size stones laid in  courses and carefully chinked with small spalls. The southwestern corner  of the room is broken down, but the eastern wall is still standing, and  shows a well-finished opening on that side. There are several Navaho  burial cists on this site.      [Illustration: Fig. 62--Plan of outlook and burial cists, No. 64.]      [Illustration: Plate LIV    Cliff Ruin No. 14]      [Illustration: Fig. 63--Plan of rectangular room No. 45.]    Figure 63 is the plan of a type of ruin which is rather anomalous in the  canyon. It occurs at the point marked 45 on the map, and occupies a  small flat area almost on top of the talus 300 feet or more above the  stream bed. It is just below the ruin described and illustrated on page  144 (figure 48), and hardly 20 feet distant from it, and yet it does not  appear to have been connected with it. It consists of a single large  room, 20 feet long by 111/2 feet wide outside, and the site commands an  extensive prospect over bottom lands on both sides of the canyon, and  above, but the only opening in the wall on that side is a little  peephole 6 inches square and 2 feet from the ground. This is sufficient,  however, to command nearly the whole outlook. There is a doorway on the  eastern side, one side of which, fairly well finished, remains. There  was apparently no other opening, unless one existed on the western side,  where, in the center, the wall is broken down to within 2 feet of the  ground. Along the western side of the room, at the present ground  surface, there are remains of a bench about a foot wide; the eastern  side is covered above this level.      [Illustration: Fig. 64--Rectangular single room.]    The masonry is very rough and chinked only with large stones. The  interior is roughly plastered in places, and small pieces of stone are  stuck on flat. The corners are rounded. Externally the masonry has the  appearance of stones laid without mortar, like a Navaho stone corral,  and were it not for the occurrence of other similar remains, it might be  regarded as of Navaho or white man's construction, as the size, site,  plan, and masonry are all anomalous. Figure 64 shows an example,  however, closely resembling the one described in these features, and  figure 65 shows another. Altogether there are four or five examples,  distributed over a considerable area.    Somewhat similar wall remains are seen in places on the canyon bottom,  where they are always of modern Navaho origin, and it is quite possible  that the ruins above mentioned should be placed in the same category. It  will be noticed that in the plan the doorway or entrance opening is on  the eastern side--an invariable requirement of Navaho house  constructions; but it is only within recent times that the Navaho have  constructed permanent, rectangular abodes, and even now such houses are  rarely built. It is difficult to understand, moreover, why recourse  should be had to such inconvenient sites, if the structures are of  Navaho origin, as these Indians always locate their hogans on the bottom  lands, or on some slight rise overlooking them.      [Illustration: Fig. 65--Single-room remains.]    Distributed throughout the canyons, wherever a favorable situation could  be found, there are a great number of sites resembling those of the  cliff outlooks, but showing now no standing wall. There is always some  evidence of human occupancy, often many pictographs on the back wall, as  in an example in the lower part of the canyon shown in plate LV. This  occurs at point 2 on the map, in a cove perhaps 100 feet across, with  caves on the northern and southern sides.      [Illustration: Plate LV    Site Marked by Pictographs]    In the southern cave there are no traces of masonry, but the back of the  cave is covered with hand prints and pictographs of deer, as shown in  the plate. In the northern cave there are traces of walls. Many of the  sites do not show the faintest trace of house structures; some of them  have remains of storage cists, and many have remains of Navaho burial  cists, associated with pictographs not of Navaho origin. Some idea of  the number and distribution of these sites may be obtained from the  following list, wherein the numbers represent the location shown on the  detailed map: 2, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 30, 38, 39, 40,  42, 43, 53, 54, 57, and 66--in all 21 sites which occur between the  mouth of De Chelly and the junction of Monument canyon, 13 miles above.  Beyond this point they are rare, as the areas of cultivable land become  scarce. A similar distribution prevails in Del Muerto.          DETAILS      SITES    The character of the site occupied by a ruin is a very important feature  where the response to the physical environment is as ready and complete  as it is in the ancient pueblo region. This feature has not received the  attention it deserves, for it is more than probable that in the ultimate  classification of ruins that will some day be formulated the site  occupied will be one of the principal elements considered, if not the  most important. The site is not so important per se, but must be  considered with reference to the specific character of the ruin upon it,  its ground plan, the character of other ruins in the vicinity which may  have been connected with it, and its topographic environment. The  character and ground plan of a cliff ruin would be so much out of place  on an open valley site that it would immediately attract attention. The  reverse is equally remarkable.    Considering all that has been written about the cliff ruins as defensive  structures, it is strange how little direct evidence there is to support  the hypothesis; how few examples can be cited which show anything that  can be construed as the result of the defensive motive except the  general impression produced on the observer. Nor, on the other hand, do  these ruins as a whole give any support to the theory that they  represent an intermediate stage in the development of the pueblo people.  Some few may, perhaps those examined by Mr F. H. Cushing south and east  of Zuni do; but more than 99 per cent of them give more support to a  theory that they are the ultimate development of pueblo architecture  than to the other hypothesis, for they contain in themselves evidence of  a knowledge of construction equal and even superior to that shown "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#19)"],[1,"recurrent  phrase: \"Kamaina! Kama-aina!\" It began on a high note, descending in  weird chromatics to the lowest tone the human ear could resolve.    The sound made me draw back. Even the Dry-towners shunned the orgiastic  rituals of Kamaina. Earthmen have a reputation for getting rid of the  more objectionable customs--by human standards--on any planet where they  live. But they don't touch religions, and Kamaina, on the surface  anyhow, was a religion.    I started to turn round and leave, as if I had inadvertently walked  through the wrong door, but my conductor hauled on my arm, and I was  wedged in too tight by now to risk a roughhouse. Trying to force my way  out would only have called attention to me, and the first of the Secret  Service maxims is; when in doubt, go along, keep quiet, and watch the  other guy.    As my eyes adapted to the dim light, I saw that most of the crowd were  Charin plainsmen or _chaks_. One or two wore Dry-town shirtcloaks, and I  even thought I saw an Earthman in the crowd, though I was never sure and  I fervently hope not. They were squatting around small crescent-shaped  tables, and all intently gazing at a flickery spot of light at the front  of the cellar. I saw an empty place at one table and dropped there,  finding the floor soft, as if cushioned.    On each table, small smudging pastilles were burning, and from these  cones of ash-tipped fire came the steamy, swimmy smoke that filled the  darkness with strange colors. Beside me an immature _chak_ girl was  kneeling, her fettered hands strained tightly back at her sides, her  naked breasts pierced for jeweled rings.    Beneath the pallid fur around her pointed ears, the exquisite animal  face was quite mad. She whispered to me, but her dialect was so thick  that I could follow only a few words, and would just as soon not have  heard those few. An older _chak_ grunted for silence and she subsided,  swaying and crooning.    There were cups and decanters on all the tables, and a woman tilted  pale, phosphorescent fluid into a cup and offered it to me. I took one  sip, then another. It was cold and pleasantly tart, and not until the  second swallow turned sweet on my tongue did I know what I tasted. I  pretended to swallow while the woman's eyes were fixed on me, then  somehow contrived to spill the filthy stuff down my shirt.    I was wary even of the fumes, but there was nothing else I could do. The  stuff was _shallavan_, outlawed on every planet in the Terran Empire and  every halfway decent planet outside it.    More and more figures, men and creatures, kept crowding into the cellar,  which was not very large. The place looked like the worst nightmare of a  drug-dreamer, ablaze with the colors of the smoking incense, the swaying  crowd, and their monotonous cries. Quite suddenly there was a blaze of  purple light and someone screamed in raving ecstasy: \"_Na ki na Nebran  n'hai Kamaina!_\"    \"Kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena!\" shrilled the tranced mob.    An old man jumped up and started haranguing the crowd. I could just  follow his dialect. He was talking about Terra. He was talking about  riots. He was jabbering mystical gibberish which I couldn't understand  and didn't want to understand, and rabble-rousing anti-Terran propaganda  which I understood much too well.    Another blaze of lights and another long scream in chorus:  \"Kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena!\"    Evarin stood in the blaze of the many-colored light.    The Toymaker, as I had seen him last, cat-smooth, gracefully alien,  shrouded in a ripple of giddy crimsons. Behind him was a blackness. I  waited till the painful blaze of lights abated, then, straining my eyes  to see past him, I got my worst shock.    A woman stood there, naked to the waist, her hands ritually fettered  with little chains that stirred and clashed musically as she moved  stiff-legged in a frozen dream. Hair like black grass banded her brow  and naked shoulders, and her eyes were crimson.    And the eyes lived in the dead dreaming face. They lived, and they were  mad with terror although the lips curved in a gently tranced smile.    Miellyn.    Evarin was speaking in that dialect I barely understood. His arms were  flung high and his cloak went spilling away from them, rippling like  something alive. The jammed humans and nonhumans swayed and chanted and  he swayed above them like an iridescent bug, weaving arms rippling back  and forth, back and forth. I strained to catch his words.    \"Our world ... an old world.\"    \"Kamayeeeeena,\" whimpered the shrill chorus.    \"... humans, humans, all humans would make slaves of us all, all save  the Children of the Ape....\"    I lost the thread for a moment. True. The Terran Empire has one small  blind spot in otherwise sane policy, ignoring that nonhuman and human  have lived placidly here for millennia: they placidly assumed that  humans were everywhere the dominant race, as on Earth itself.    The Toymaker's weaving arms went on spinning, spinning. I rubbed my eyes  to clear them of _shallavan_ and incense. I hoped that what I saw was an  illusion of the drug--something, something huge and dark, was hovering  over the girl. She stood placidly, hands clasped on her chains, but her  eyes writhed in the frozen calm of her face.    Then something--I can only call it a sixth sense--bore it on me that  there was _someone_ outside the door. I was perhaps the only creature  there, except for Evarin, not drugged with _shallavan_, and perhaps  that's all it was. But during the days in the Secret Service I'd had to  develop some extra senses. Five just weren't enough for survival.    I _knew_ somebody was fixing to break down that door, and I had a good  idea why. I'd been followed, by the legate's orders, and, tracking me  here, they'd gone away and brought back reinforcements.    Someone struck a blow on the door and a stentorian voice bawled, \"Open  up there, in the name of the Empire!\"    The chanting broke in ragged quavers. Evarin stopped. Somewhere a woman  screamed. The lights abruptly went out and a stampede started in the  room. Women struck me with chains, men kicked, there were shrieks and  howls. I thrust my way forward, butting with elbows and knees and  shoulders.    A dusky emptiness yawned and I got a glimpse of sunlight and open sky  and knew that Evarin had stepped through into _somewhere_ and was gone.  The banging on the door sounded like a whole regiment of Spaceforce out  there. I dived toward the shimmer of little stars which marked Miellyn's  tiara in the darkness, braving the black horror hovering over her, and  touched rigid girl-flesh, cold as death.    I grabbed her and ducked sideways. This time it wasn't intuition--nine  times out of ten, anyway, intuition is just a mental shortcut which adds  up all the things which your subconscious has noticed while you were  busy thinking about something else. Every native building on Wolf had  concealed entrances and exits and I know where to look for them. This  one was exactly where I expected. I pushed at it and found myself in a  long, dim corridor.    The head of a woman peered from an opening door. She saw Miellyn's limp  body hanging on my arm and her mouth widened in a silent scream. Then  the head popped back out of sight and a door slammed. I heard the bolt  slide. I ran for the end of the hall, the girl in my arms, thinking that  this was where I came in, as far as Miellyn was concerned, and wondering  why I bothered.    The door opened on a dark, peaceful street. One lonely moon was setting  beyond the rooftops. I set Miellyn on her feet, but she moaned and  crumpled against me. I put my shirtcloak around her bare shoulders.  Judging by the noises and yells, we'd gotten out just in time. No one  came out the exit behind us. Either the Spaceforce had plugged it or,  more likely, everyone else in the cellar had been too muddled by drugs  to know what was going on.    But it was only a few minutes, I knew, before Spaceforce would check the  whole building for concealed escape holes. Suddenly, and irrelevantly, I  found myself thinking of a day not too long ago, when I'd stood up in  front of a unit-in-training of Spaceforce, introduced to them as an  Intelligence expert on native towns, and solemnly warned them about  concealed exits and entrances. I wondered, for half a minute, if it  might not be simpler just to wait here and let them pick me up.    Then I hoisted Miellyn across my shoulders. She was heavier than she  looked, and after a minute, half conscious, she began to struggle and  moan. There was a _chak_-run cookshop down the street, a place I'd once  known well, with an evil reputation and worse food, but it was quiet and  stayed open all night. I turned in at the door, bending at the low  lintel.    The place was smoke-filled and foul-smelling. I dumped Miellyn on a  couch and sent the frowsy waiter for two bowls of noodles and coffee,  handed him a few extra coins, and told him to leave us alone. He  probably drew the worst possible inference--I saw his muzzle twitch at  the smell of _shallavan_--but it was that kind of place anyhow. He drew  down the shutters and went.    I stared at the unconscious girl, then shrugged and started on the  noodles. My own head was still swimmy with the fumes, incense and drug,  and I wanted it clear. I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do, but  I had Evarin's right-hand girl, and I was going to use her.    The noodles were greasy and had a curious taste, but they were hot, and  I ate all of one bowl before Miellyn stirred and whimpered and put up  one hand, with a little clinking of chains, to her hair. The gesture was  indefinably reminiscent of Dallisa, and for the first time I saw the  likeness between them. It made me wary and yet curiously softened.    Finding she could not move freely, she rolled over, sat up and stared  around in growing bewilderment and dismay.    \"There was a sort of riot,\" I said. \"I got you out. Evarin"]]]
