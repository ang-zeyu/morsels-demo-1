[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#19)"],[1,"     there is real danger and bruising, if the hail be worth calling        so, for the whole body; while in rain, if _it_ be rain also worth        calling rain, the great plague is the beating and drenching in        the face.          16. SWUNG. Opposed to 'sit' in previous line. The human creature,        though it sate steady on this unshakable earth, had no house over        its head. The bird, that lived on the tremblingest and weakest of        bending things, had her _nest_ on it, in which even her        infinitely tender brood were _deep_ sheltered and warm, from the        _wind_. It is impossible to find a lovelier instance of pure        poetical antithesis.          20. HOUSE. Again antithetic to the perfect word 'Home' in the        line before. A house is exactly, and only, half-way to a 'home.'        Man had not yet got so far as even that! and had lost, the chorus        satirically imply, even the power of getting the other half,        ever, since his \"_She_ gave me of the tree.\"          24. BRICKS. The first bad inversion permitted, for \"to combine        bricks with cement.\" In my Swallow lecture I had no time to go        into the question of her building materials; the point is,        however, touched upon in the Appendix (pp. 110, 112, and note).          30. 'DRILL,' for 'quarry out,' 'tunnel,' etc., the best general        term available.          36. COMPOSER of the music; POET of the meaning.          Compare, and think over, the Bullfinch's nest, etc., Sec. 48 to 61        of 'Eagle's Nest.'          In modern music the _meaning_ is, I believe, by the reputed        masters omitted.          39. To SPIN, or _un_ravel. Synthesis and analysis, in the vulgar        Greek slang.          46. MAD. Compare Byron of the English in _his_ day. \"A parcel of        staring boobies who go about gaping and wishing to be at once        cheap and magnificent. A man is a fool now, who travels in France        or Italy, till that tribe of wretches be swept home again. In two        or three years, the first rush will be over, and the Continent        will be roomy and agreeable.\" (Life, vol. ii., p. 319.) For        sketches of the English of seventeen years later, at the same        _spots_ (Wengern Alp and Interlachen), see, if you _can_ see, in        any library, public or private, at Geneva, Topffer's 'Excursions        dans les Alpes, 1832.' Douzieme, Treizieme, and Quatorzieme        Journee.          48. THE TAIL. Mr. Courthope does not condescend to italicize his        pun; but a swallow-tailed and adder-tongued pun like this must be        paused upon. Compare Mr. Murray's Tale of the Town of Lucca, to        be seen between the arrival of one train and the departure of the        next,--nothing there but twelve churches and a cathedral,--mostly        of the tenth to thirteenth century.          60. AFAR. I did not know of this weather sign; nor, I suppose,        did the Duke of Hamilton's keeper, who shot the last pair of        Choughs on Arran in 1863. ('Birds of the West of Scotland,' p.        165.) I trust the climate has wept for them; certainly our        Coniston clouds grow heavier, in these last years.          63. SOCIAL. Rightly sung by the Birds in three syllables; but the        lagging of the previous line (probably intentional, but not        pleasant,) makes the lightness of this one a little dangerous for        a clumsy reader. The 'i-al' of 'social' does not fill the line as        two full short syllables, else the preceding word should have        been written '_on_,' not 'upon.' The five syllables, rightly        given, just take the time of two iambs; but there _are_ readers        rude enough to accent the 'on' of upon, and take 'social' for two        short syllables.          64. HOLD. Short for 'to hold'--but it is a licentious        construction, so also, in next line, 'themselves' for 'they        themselves.' The stanza is on the whole the worst in the poem,        its irony and essential force being much dimmed by obscure        expression, and even slightly staggering continuity of thought.        The Rooks may be properly supposed to have taught men to dispute,        but not to write. The Swallow teaches building, literally, and        the Owl moping, literally; but the Rook does not teach        pamphleteering literally. And the 'of old' is redundant, for        rhyme's sake, since Rooks hold parliaments now as much as ever        they did.          76. EACH YEAR. I doubt the fact; and too sadly suspect that birds        take different mates. What a question to have to ask at this time        of day and year!          82. RIVERS. Read slowly. The 'customs' are rivers that 'go on        forever' flowing from the fount of the soul. The Heart drinks of        them, as of waterbrooks.          92. PHILOSOPHY. The author should at least have given a note or        two to explain the sense in which he uses words so wide as this.        The philosophy which begins in pride, and concludes in malice, is        indeed _a_ fountain--though not _the_ fountain--of woes, to        mankind. But true philosophy such as Fenelon's or Sir Thomas        More's, is a well of peace.          98. WORTH. Again, it is not clearly told us what the author means        by the worth of a bird's soul, nor how the birds learned it. The        reader is left to discern, and collect for himself--with patience        such as not one in a thousand now-a-days possesses, the        opposition between the \"fount of our soul\" (line 83) and fountain        of philosophy.    124. I could willingly enlarge on these last two stanzas, but think my  duty will be better done to the poet if I quote, for conclusion, two  lighter pieces of his verse, which will require no comment, and are  closer to our present purpose. The first,--the lament of the French  Cook in purgatory,--has, for once, a note by the author, giving M.  Soyer's authority for the items of the great dish,--\"symbol of  philanthropy, served at York during the great commemorative banquet  after the first exhibition.\" The commemorative soul of the tormented  Chef--always making a dish like it, of which nobody ever eats--sings  thus:--                                     \"Do you veesh      To hear before you taste, of de hundred-guinea deesh?      Has it not been sung by every knife and fork,      'L'extravagance culinaire a l'Alderman,' at York?      Vy, ven I came here, eighteen Octobers seence,      I dis deesh was making for your Royal Preence,      Ven half de leeving world, cooking all de others,      Swore an oath hereafter, to be men and brothers.      All de leetle Songsters in de voods dat build,      Hopped into the kitchen asking to be kill'd;      All who in de open furrows find de seeds,      Or de mountain berries, all de farmyard breeds,--      Ha--I see de knife, vile de deesh it shapens,      Vith les petits noix, of four-and-twenty capons,      Dere vere dindons, fatted poulets, fowls in plenty,      Five times nine of partridges, and of pheasants twenty;      Ten grouse, that should have had as many covers,      All in dis one deesh, with six preety plovers,      Forty woodcocks, plump, and heavy in the scales,      Pigeons dree good dozens, six-and-dirty quails,      Ortulans, ma foi, and a century of snipes,      But de preetiest of dem all was twice tree dozen pipes      Of de melodious larks, vich each did clap the ving,      And veeshed de pie vas open, dat dey all might sing!\"    125. There are stiff bits of prosody in these verses,--one or two,  indeed, quite unmanageable,--but we must remember that French meter  will not read into ours. The last piece I will give flows very  differently. It is in express imitation of Scott--but no nobler model  could be chosen; and how much better for minor poets sometimes to write  in another's manner, than always to imitate their own.    This chant is sung by the soul of the Francesca of the Bird-ordained  purgatory; whose torment is to be dressed only in falling snow, each  flake striking cold to her heart as it falls,--but such lace  investiture costing, not a cruel price per yard in souls of women, nor  a mortal price in souls of birds.    Her 'snow-mantled shadow' sings:        \"Alas, my heart! No grief so great      As thinking on a happy state      In misery. Ah, dear is power      To female hearts! Oh, blissful hour      When Blanche and Flavia, joined with me,      Tri-feminine Directory,      Dispensed in latitudes below      The laws of flounce and furbelow;      And held on bird and beast debate,      What lives should die to serve our state!      We changed our statutes with the moon,      And oft in January or June,      At deep midnight, we would prescribe      Some furry kind, or feathered tribe.      At morn, we sent the mandate forth;      Then rose the hunters of the North:      And all the trappers of the West      Bowed at our feminine behest.      Died every seal that dared to rise      To his round air-hole in the ice;      Died each Siberian fox and hare      And ermine trapt in snow-built snare.      For us the English fowler set      The ambush of his whirling net;      And by green Rother's reedy side      The blue kingfisher flashed and died.      His life for us the seamew gave      High upon Orkney's lonely wave;      Nor was our queenly power unknown      In Iceland or by Amazon;      For where the brown duck stripped her breast      For her dear eggs and windy nest,      Three times her bitter spoil was won      For woman; and when all was done,      She called her snow-white piteous drake,      Who plucked his bosom for our sake.\"    126. \"See 'Hartwig's Polar World' for the manner of taking  Eiderdown.\"--Once more, we have thus much of author's note, but edition  and page not specified, which, however, I am fortunately able to  supply. Mr. Hartwig's miscellany being a favorite--what can I call it,  sand-hill?--of my own, out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21200"],[0,"The Letters of Cicero, Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"  question was referred to the panel in the preliminary proceedings, the  severity of the decisions passes belief: there was no disagreement in  voting, the defendant carried none of his points, while the accuser got  even more than he asked. He was triumphant. Need I say more? Hortensius  would have it that he was the only one of us who had seen the truth.  There was not a man who did not think it impossible for him to stand his  trial without being condemned a thousand times over. Farther, when I was  produced as a witness, I suppose you have been told how the shouts of  Clodius's supporters were answered by the jury rising to their feet to  gather round me, and openly to offer their throats to P. Clodius in my  defence. This seemed to me a greater compliment than the well-known  occasion when your fellow citizens[98] stopped Xenocrates from taking an  oath in the witness-box, or when, upon the accounts of Metellus  Numidicus[99] being as usual handed round, a Roman jury refused to look  at them. The compliment paid me, I repeat, was much greater.  Accordingly, as the jurymen were protecting me as the mainstay of the  country, it was by their voices that the defendant was overwhelmed, and  with him all his advocates suffered a crushing blow. Next day my house  was visited by as great a throng as that which escorted me home when I  laid down the consulship. Our eminent Areopagites then exclaimed that  they would not come into court unless a guard was assigned them. The  question was put to the whole panel: there was only one vote against the  need of a guard. The question is brought before the senate: the decree  is passed in the most solemn and laudatory terms: the jurymen are  complimented: the magistrates are commissioned to carry it out: no one  thought that the fellow would venture on a defence. \"Tell me, ye Muses,  now how first the fire befell!\"[100] You know Bald-head, the Nanneian  millionaire,[101] that panegyrist of mine, whose complimentary oration  I have already mentioned to you in a letter. In two days' time, by the  agency of a single slave, and one, too, from a school of gladiators, he  settled the whole business--he summoned them to an interview, made a  promise, offered security, paid money down. Still farther, good heavens,  what a scandal! even favours from certain ladies, and introductions to  young men of rank, were thrown in as a kind of _pourboire_ to some of  the jurors. Accordingly, with the loyalists holding completely aloof,  with the forum full of slaves, twenty-five jurors were yet found so  courageous that, though at the risk of their lives, they preferred even  death to producing universal ruin. There were thirty-one who were more  influenced by famine than fame. On seeing one of these latter Catulus  said to him, \"Why did you ask us for a guard? Did you fear being robbed  of the money?\" There you have, as briefly as I could put it, the nature  of the trial and the cause of the acquittal.    Next you want to know the present state of public affairs and of my own.  That settlement of the Republic--firmly established by my wisdom, as you  thought, as I thought by God's--which seemed fixed on a sure foundation  by the unanimity of all loyalists and the influence of my  consulship--that I assure you, unless some God take compassion on us,  has by this one verdict escaped from our grasp: if \"verdict\" it is to be  called, when thirty of the most worthless and dissolute fellows in Rome  for a paltry sum of money obliterate every principle of law and justice,  and when that which every man--I had almost said every animal--knows to  have taken place, a Thalna, a Plautus, and a Spongia, and other scum of  that sort decide not to have taken place. However, to console you as to  the state of the Republic, rascaldom is not as cheerful and exultant in  its victory as the disloyal hoped after the infliction of such a wound  upon the Republic. For they fully expected that when religion, morality,  the honour of juries, and the prestige of the senate had sustained such  a crushing fall, victorious profligacy and lawless lust would openly  exact vengeance from all the best men for the mortification which the  strictness of my consulship had branded in upon all the worst. And it is  once more I--for I do not feel as if I were boasting vaingloriously when  speaking of myself to you, especially in a letter not intended to be  read by others--it was I once more, I say, who revived the fainting  spirits of the loyalists, cheering and encouraging each personally.  Moreover, by my denunciations and invectives against those corrupt  jurors I left none of the favourers and supporters of that victory a  word to say for themselves. I gave the consul Piso no rest anywhere, I  got him deprived of Syria, which had been already plighted to him, I  revived the fainting spirit of the senate and recalled it to its former  severity. I overwhelmed Clodius in the senate to his face, both in a set  speech, very weighty and serious, and also in an interchange of  repartees, of which I append a specimen for your delectation. The rest  lose all point and grace without the excitement of the contest, or, as  you Greeks call it, the [Greek: agon]. Well, at the meeting of the  senate on the 15th of May, being called on for my opinion, I spoke at  considerable length on the high interests of the Republic, and brought  in the following passage by a happy inspiration: \"Do not, Fathers,  regard yourselves as fallen utterly, do not faint, because you have  received one blow. The wound is one which I cannot disguise, but which I  yet feel sure should not be regarded with extreme fear: to fear would  shew us to be the greatest of cowards, to ignore it the greatest of  fools. Lentulus was twice acquitted, so was Catiline, a third such  criminal has now been let loose by jurors upon the Republic. You are  mistaken, Clodius: it is not for the city but for the prison that the  jurors have reserved you, and their intention was not to retain you in  the state, but to deprive you of the privilege of exile. Wherefore,  Fathers, rouse up all your courage, hold fast to your high calling.  There still remains in the Republic the old unanimity of the loyalists:  their feelings have been outraged, their resolution has not been  weakened: no fresh mischief has been done, only what was actually  existing has been discovered. In the trial of one profligate many like  him have been detected.\"--But what am I about? I have copied almost a  speech into a letter. I return to the duel of words. Up gets our  dandified young gentleman, and throws in my teeth my having been at  Baiae. It wasn't true, but what did that matter to him? \"It is as though  you were to say,\" replied I, \"that I had been in disguise!\" \"What  business,\" quoth he, \"has an Arpinate with hot baths?\" \"Say that to your  patron,\" said I, \"who coveted the watering-place of an Arpinate.\"[102]  For you know about the marine villa. \"How long,\" said he, \"are we to put  up with this king?\" \"Do you mention a king,\" quoth I, \"when Rex[103]  made no mention of you?\" He, you know, had swallowed the inheritance of  Rex in anticipation. \"You have bought a house,\" says he. \"You would  think that he said,\" quoth I, \"you have bought a jury.\" \"They didn't  trust you on your oath,\" said he. \"Yes,\" said I, \"twenty-five jurors did  trust me, thirty-one didn't trust you, for they took care to get their  money beforehand.\" Here he was overpowered by a burst of applause and  broke down without a word to say.    My own position is this: with the loyalists I hold the same place as  when you left town, with the tagrag and bobtail of the city I hold a  much better one than at your departure. For it does me no harm that my  evidence appears not to have availed. Envy has been let blood without  causing pain, and even more so from the fact that all the supporters of  that flagitious proceeding confess that a perfectly notorious fact has  been hushed up by bribing the jury. Besides, the wretched starveling  mob, the blood-sucker of the treasury, imagines me to be high in the  favour of Magnus--and indeed we have been mutually united by frequent  pleasant intercourse to such an extent, that our friends the boon  companions of the conspiracy, the young chin-tufts, speak of him in  ordinary conversation as Gnaeus Cicero. Accordingly, both in the circus  and at the gladiatorial games, I received a remarkable ovation without a  single cat-call. There is at present a lively anticipation of the  elections, in which, contrary to everybody's wishes, our friend Magnus  is pushing the claims of Aulus's son;[104] and in that matter his  weapons are neither his prestige nor his popularity, but those by which  Philip said that any fortress could be taken--if only an ass laden with  gold could make its way up into it. Farthermore, that precious consul,  playing as it were second fiddle to Pompey,[105] is said to have  undertaken the business and to have bribery agents at his house, which I  don't believe. But two decrees have already passed the house of an  unpopular character, because they are thought to be directed against the  consul on the demand of Cato and Domitius[106]--one that search should  be allowed in magistrates' houses, and a second, that all who had  bribery agents in their houses were guilty of treason. The tribune Lurco  also, having entered on his office irregularly in view of the AElian law,  has been relieved from the provisions both of the AElian and Fufian laws,  in order to enable him to propose his law on bribery, which he  promulgated with correct auspices though a cripple.[107] Accordingly,  the _comitia_ have been postponed to the 27th of July. There is this  novelty in his bill, that a man who has promised money among the tribes,  but not paid it, is not liable, but, if he has paid, he is liable for  life to pay 3,000 sesterces to each tribe. I remarked that P. Clodius  had obeyed this law by"]]]
