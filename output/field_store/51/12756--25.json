And to the business man who has  letters to write and wishes to write them well, no one ever says  anything.  The business man himself has begun to have a vague impression  that he would like to improve his command of language; but who is there  who even pretends to have any power to help him?  There is the school  grind of \"grammar and composition,\" and if it is kept up for enough  years, and the student happens to find any point of interest in it, some  good may result from it.  That is the best that anyone has to offer.    Some thoughtful people are convinced that writing, even business  letters, is as much a matter for professional training as music or  painting or carpentry or plumbing.  That view certainly seems  reasonable.  And against that is the conviction of the general public  that use of language is an art essentially different from any of the  other arts, that all people possess it more or less, and that the degree  to which they possess it depends on their general education and  environment; while the few who possess it in a preeminent degree,  do so by reason of peculiar endowments and talent, not to say genius.  This latter view, too, is full of truth.  We have only to reflect  a moment to see that rhetoric as it is commonly taught can by  no possibility give actual skill.  Rhetoric is a system of  scientific analysis.  Aristotle was a scientist, not an artist.  Analysis tears to pieces, divides into parts, and so destroys.  The practical art of writing is wholly synthesis,---building up,  putting together, creating,---and so, of course, a matter of instinct.  All the dissection, or vivisection, in the world, would never teach a  man how to bring a human being into the world, or any other living  thing; yet the untaught instinct of all animals solves the problem of  creation every minute of the world's history.  In fact, it is a favorite  comparison to speak of poems, stories, and other works of literary art  as being the children of the writer's brain; as if works of literary  art came about in precisely the same simple, yet mysterious,  way that children are conceived and brought into the world.    Yet the comparison must not be pushed too far, and we must not lose  sight of the facts in the case.  You and I were not especially endowed  with literary talent.  Perhaps we are business men and are glad we are  not so endowed.  But we want to write and speak better than we do,  ---if possible, better than those with whom we have to compete.  Now, is there not a practical way in which we can help ourselves?  There is no thought that we shall become geniuses, or anything of the  kind.  For us, why should there be any difference between plumbing and  writing?  If all men were born plumbers, still some would be much better  than others, and no doubt the poor ones could improve their  work in a great measure, simply by getting hints and trying.  However, we all know that the trying will not do _very_ much good  without the hints.  Now, where are the master-plumber's hints---  or rather, the master-writer's hints, for the apprentice writer?    No doubt some half million unsuccessful authors will jump to their feet  on the instant and offer their services.  But the business man is not  convinced of their ability to help him.  Nor does he expect very much  real help from the hundred thousand school teachers who teach \"grammar  and composition\" in the schools.  The fact is, the rank and file of  teachers in the common schools have learned just enough to know that  they want help themselves.  Probably there is not a more eager class  in existence than they.    The stock advice of successful authors is, Practise.  But unluckily I  have practised, and it does not seem, to do any good.  \"I write one  hundred long letters (or rather dictate them to my stenographer) every  day,\" says the business man.  \"My newspaper reports would fill a hundred  splendid folios,\" says the newspaper man, \"and yet---and yet---I can't  seem to hit it when I write a novel.\" No, practice without guidance will  not do very much, especially if we happen to be of the huge class of the  uninspired.  Our lack of genius, however, does not seem to be a reason  why we should continue utterly ignorant of the art of making ourselves  felt as well as heard when we use words.  Here again use of language  differs somewhat from painting or music, for unless we had some talent  there would be no reason for attempting those arts.    Let us attack our problem from a common-sense point of view.  How have  greater writers learned to write?  How do plumbers learn plumbing?    The process by which plumbers learn is simple.  They watch the  master-plumber, and then try to do likewise, and they keep at this for  two or three years.  At the end they are themselves master-plumbers,  or at least masters of plumbing.    The method by which great writers, especially great writers who didn't  start with a peculiar genius, have learned to write is much the same.  Take Stevenson, for instance: he says he \"played the sedulous ape.\"  He studied the masterpieces of literature, and tried to imitate them.  He kept at this for several years.  At the end he was a master himself.  We have reason to believe that the same was true of Thackeray, of Dumas,  of Cooper, of Balzac, of Lowell.  All these men owe their skill very  largely to practice in imitation of other great writers, and often of  writers not as great as they themselves.  Moreover, no one will accuse  any of these writers of not being original in the highest degree.  To imitate a dozen or fifty great writers never makes imitators; the  imitator, so called, is the person who imitates one.  To imitate even  two destroys all the bad effects of imitation.    Franklin, himself a great writer, well describes the method in his  autobiography:    How Franklin Learned to Write.    \"A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,  of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their  abilities for study.  He was of the opinion that it was improper,  and that they were naturally unequal to it.  I took the contrary side,  perhaps a little for dispute's sake.  He was naturally more eloquent,  having a ready plenty of words, and sometimes, as I thought, I was  vanquished more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons.  As we parted without settling the point, and were not to see one another  again for some time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which  I copied fair and sent to him.  He answered, and I replied.  Three or four letters on a side had passed, when my father happened to  find my papers and read them.  Without entering into the subject in  dispute, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing;  observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct  spelling and pointing (which I owed to the printing-house),  I fell far short in elegance of expression, in method, and in  perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several instances.  I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew more attentive to the  manner in writing, and determined to endeavor an improvement.    \"About this time I met with an odd volume of the _Spectator_.  It was the third.  I had never before seen any of them.  I bought it,  read it over and over, and was much delighted with it.  I thought the  writing excellent, and wished it possible to imitate it.  With this view  I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiments in  each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the  book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted  sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before,  in any suitable words that should come to hand.  Then I compared my  _Spectator_ with the original, discovered some of my faults, and  corrected them.  But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness  in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired  before that time if I had gone on making verses, since the continued  search for words of the same import, but of different length to suit the  measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under  a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to  fix that variety in mind, and make me master of it.  Therefore I took  some of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time,  when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again.    \"I also sometimes jumbled my collection of hints into confusion, and  after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order before  I began to form the full sentences and complete the subject.  This was to teach me method in the arrangement of the thoughts.  By comparing my work with the original, I discovered my faults and  amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying, that,  in certain particulars of small import, I had been fortunate enough to  improve the method or the language, and this encouraged me to think that  I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer;  of which I was extremely ambitious.  My time for these exercises and for  reading was at night, after work, or before it began in the morning,  or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone,  evading as much as I could the common attendance on public  worship which my father used to exact of me when I was under  his care, and which indeed I still continued to consider a duty,  though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.\"      A Practical Method.    Aristotle's method, though perfect in theory, has failed in practice.  Franklin's method is too elementary and undeveloped to be of general  use.  Taking Aristotle's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#19)"],[1," never  without it. His little hand always held it, and I pictured him every  morning when he awoke from his joyless sleep, picking up his poor toy  and going out to his balcony, as other boys go to play. Or perhaps he  slept with it, as little ones do with dolls and whip-tops.    I could see that the room beyond the window was bare. I never saw any  one in it. The heat must have been terrible, for it could have had no  ventilation. Once I missed the boy from the balcony, but saw his white  head moving about slowly in the dusk of the room. Gradually the little  fellow became a burden to me. I found myself continually thinking of  him, and troubled with that remorse that thoughtless people feel even  for suffering for which they are not in the slightest degree  responsible. Not that I ever saw any suffering on his face. It was  patient, thoughtful, serious, but with never a sign of petulance. What  thoughts filled that young head--what contemplation took the place of  what should have been the [v]ineffable upspringing of childish  emotion--what complaint or questioning were living behind that white  face--no one could guess. In an older person the face would have  betokened a resignation that found peace in the hope of things  hereafter. In this child, without hope or aspiration, it was sad beyond  expression.    One day as I passed I nodded at him. He made no sign in return. I  repeated the nod on another trip, waving my hand at him--but without  avail. At length, in response to an unusually winning exhortation, his  pale lips trembled into a smile, but a smile that was soberness itself.  Wherever I went that day that smile went with me. Wherever I saw  children playing in the parks, or trotting along with their hands  nestled in strong fingers that guided and protected, I thought of that  tiny watcher in the balcony--joyless, hopeless, friendless--a desolate  mite, hanging between the blue sky and the gladsome streets, lifting his  wistful face now to the peaceful heights of the one, and now looking  with grave wonder on the ceaseless tumult of the other. At length--but  why go any further? Why is it necessary to tell that the boy had no  father, that his mother was bedridden from his birth, and that his  sister pasted labels in a drug-house, and he was thus left to himself.    It is sufficient to say that I went to Coney Island yesterday, and  watched the bathers and the children--listened to the crisp, lingering  music of the waves--ate a robust lunch on the pier--wandered in and out  among the booths, tents, and hub-bub--and that through all these  pleasures I had a companion that enjoyed them with a gravity that I can  never hope to [v]emulate, but with a soulfulness that was touching. As I  came back in the boat, the breezes singing through the [v]cordage, music  floating from the fore-deck, and the sun lighting with its dying rays  the shipping that covered the river, there was sitting in front of me a  very pale but very happy bit of a boy, open-eyed with wonder, but sober  and self-contained, clasping tightly in his little fingers a short,  battered stick. And finally, whenever I pass by a certain overhanging  balcony now, I am sure of a smile from an intimate and esteemed friend  who lives there.    HENRY W. GRADY.          ARIEL'S TRIUMPH[141-*]           This story is taken from Booth Tarkington's novel, _The Conquest of       Canaan_, which gives an admirable description of modern life in an       American town. Joe Louden, the hero, and Ariel Tabor, the heroine,       were both friendless and, in a way, forlorn. How both of them       triumphed over obstacles and won success and happiness is the theme       of a book which is notable for keen observation of character and       for a quiet and delightful humor.      I    Ariel had worked all the afternoon over her mother's wedding-gown, and  two hours were required by her toilet for the dance. She curled her hair  frizzily, burning it here and there, with a slate-pencil heated over a  lamp-chimney, and she placed above one ear three or four large  artificial roses, taken from an old hat of her mother's, which she had  found in a trunk in the store-room. Possessing no slippers, she  carefully blacked and polished her shoes, which had been clumsily  resoled, and fastened into the strings of each small rosettes of red  ribbon; after which she practised swinging the train of her skirt until  she was proud of her manipulation of it.    She had no powder, but found in her grandfather's room a lump of  magnesia, which he was in the habit of taking for heartburn, and passed  it over and over her brown face and hands. Then a lingering gaze into  her small mirror gave her joy at last; she yearned so hard to see  herself charming that she did see herself so. Admiration came, and she  told herself that she was more attractive to look at than she had ever  been in her life, and that, perhaps, at last she might begin to be  sought for like other girls. The little glass showed a sort of  prettiness in her thin, unmatured young face; tripping dance-tunes ran  through her head, her feet keeping the time--ah, she did so hope to  dance often that night! Perhaps--perhaps she might be asked for every  number. And so, wrapping an old water-proof cloak about her, she took  her grandfather's arm and sallied forth, with high hopes in her beating  heart.    It was in the dressing-room that the change began to come. Alone, at  home in her own ugly little room, she had thought herself almost  beautiful; but here in the brightly lighted chamber crowded with the  other girls it was different. There was a big [v]cheval-glass at one end  of the room, and she faced it, when her turn came--for the mirror was  popular--with a sinking spirit. There was the contrast, like a picture  painted and framed. The other girls all wore their hair after the  fashion introduced to Canaan by Mamie Pike the week before, on her  return from a visit to Chicago. None of them had \"crimped\" and none had  bedecked their tresses with artificial flowers. Her alterations of the  wedding-dress had not been successful; the skirt was too short in front  and higher on one side than on the other, showing too plainly the  heavy-soled shoes, which had lost most of their polish in the walk  through the snow. The ribbon rosettes were fully revealed, and as she  glanced at their reflection, she heard the words, \"Look at that train  and those rosettes!\" whispered behind her, and saw in the mirror two  pretty young women turn away with their handkerchiefs over their mouths  and retreat hurriedly to an alcove. All the feet in the room except  Ariel's were in dainty kid or satin slippers of the color of the dresses  from which they glimmered out, and only Ariel wore a train.    She went away from the mirror and pretended to be busy with a hanging  thread in her sleeve.    She was singularly an alien in the chattering room, although she had  been born and had lived all her life in the town. Perhaps her position  among the young ladies may be best defined by the remark, generally  current among them that evening, to the effect that it was \"very sweet  of Mamie to invite her.\" Ariel was not like the others; she was not of  them, and never had been. Indeed, she did not know them very well. Some  of them nodded to her and gave her a word of greeting pleasantly; all of  them whispered about her with wonder and suppressed amusement, but none  talked to her. They were not unkindly, but they were young and eager and  excited over their own interests,--which were then in the \"gentlemen's  dressing-room.\"    Each of the other girls had been escorted by a youth of the place, and,  one by one, joining these escorts in the hall outside the door, they  descended the stairs, until only Ariel was left. She came down alone  after the first dance had begun, and greeted her young hostess's mother  timidly. Mrs. Pike--a small, frightened-looking woman with a ruby  necklace--answered her absently, and hurried away to see that the  [v]imported waiters did not steal anything.    Ariel sat in one of the chairs against the wall and watched the dancers  with a smile of eager and benevolent interest. In Canaan no parents, no  guardians or aunts were haled forth o' nights to [v]duenna the  junketings of youth; Mrs. Pike did not reappear, and Ariel sat  conspicuously alone; there was nothing else for her to do, but it was  not an easy matter.    When the first dance reached an end, Mamie Pike came to her for a moment  with a cheery welcome, and was immediately surrounded by a circle of  young men and women, flushed with dancing, shouting as was their wont,  laughing [v]inexplicably over words and phrases and unintelligible  [v]monosyllables, as if they all belonged to a secret society and these  cries were symbols of things exquisitely humorous, which only they  understood. Ariel laughed with them more heartily than any other, so  that she might seem to be of them and as merry as they were; but almost  immediately she found herself outside of the circle, and presently they  all whirled away into another dance, and she was left alone again.    So she sat, no one coming near her, through several dances, trying to  maintain the smile of delighted interest upon her face, though she felt  the muscles of her face beginning to ache with their fixedness, her eyes  growing hot and glazed. All the other girls were provided with partners  for every dance, with several young men left over, these latter lounging  [v]hilariously together in the doorways. Ariel was careful not to glance  toward them, but she could not help hating them. Once or twice between  the dances she saw Miss Pike speak appealingly to one of the  [v]superfluous, glancing, at the same time, in her own direction, and  Ariel could see, too, that the appeal proved unsuccessful, until at last  Mamie approached her, leading Norbert Flitcroft, partly by the hand,  partly by will power.
