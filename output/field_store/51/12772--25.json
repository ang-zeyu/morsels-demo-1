On the afternoon of the second day, Reuben asked permission of the  first mate to go ashore for a few hours.    \"Certainly, Whitney,\" the officer said. \"You have proved a very  useful hand on the way out, which is more than most do who work  their passage. Nine out of ten of them are not worth their salt, to  say nothing of the rest of their rations. You can stay on shore  tonight, if you like; but you must come off early in the morning.  We hope to get away in good time.\"    On landing, Reuben was much struck with the variety of the scene.  In the streets of Cape Town were men of many types. Here was the  English merchant and man of business, looking and dressing just as  he would at home. Names over the shop doors were for the most part  Dutch, as was the appearance of the majority of the white men in  the streets. Dutch farmers in broad hats and homespun garments,  mounted on rough ponies, clattered along through the streets. The  manual work was for the most part done by swarthy natives, while  among the crowd were numbers of Malays, with dark olive skins,  small eyes, and jet-black hair, their women being arrayed in every  shade of gaudy colour.    For some time Reuben wandered about the streets, greatly amused at  all he saw. Towards evening he turned his face towards the sea, as  he had no wish to avail himself of the permission given him to sleep  on shore. Presently he encountered Miss Hudson and Miss Furley,  walking the other way. The former nodded brightly, for she had  several times spoken to Reuben, since their first acquaintanceship.    Reuben touched his hat, and proceeded on his way. He had gone but a  few yards when he heard a loud cry, and everyone darted suddenly  into shops or round corners.    Looking round in surprise, Reuben saw what had caused the movement.  A Malay, with his long hair streaming down his shoulders, was  rushing down the street, giving vent to terrible yells; in his hand  he held a crease, with which, just as Reuben looked round, he cut  down a native who had tried, too late, to make his escape.    The two English girls, confused and alarmed at the sudden outburst;  and unable, until too late, to comprehend the cause of it, stood  alone in the middle of the street and, too terrified now to move,  clung to each other, regardless of the shouts to fly raised by  people at the windows and doors.    [Illustration: The Ladies Saved from the Malay's Crease.]    The Malay, with a howl of exultation, made at them with uplifted  crease. Reuben sprang forward, passed the terrified women when the  Malay was within four paces of them, and threw himself with all his  force upon him. The Malay, whose eyes were fixed upon the ladies,  was taken by surprise by the assault; and his crease had not time  to fall when Reuben sprang upon him.    The shock threw both to the ground; Reuben, as he fell, throwing  both arms round his adversary. The Malay struggled furiously, and  the combatants rolled over and over on the ground. Strong as Reuben  was, the frenzy of the Malay gave him greater power; and the lad  felt he could not long retain his grip of the arm with which the  Malay strove to use his crease.    Help, however, was not long in coming. A native policeman ran up at  full speed; and brought his heavy club, with his full force, down  on the head of the Malay. The latter's limbs at once relaxed, and  Reuben sprang to his feet; breathless, but not seriously harmed,  although the blood was freely flowing from some slight wounds he  had received from the Malay's sharp-edged weapon.        Chapter 7: Gratitude.      Reuben looked round, upon gaining his feet. He saw Miss Hudson  standing by the side of her companion; who had fallen, fainting, to  the ground. Mr. Hudson and Captain Wilson, running at their full  speed, were within a few paces of the girls. They had entered a  shop to make a purchase, while the ladies strolled on; and although  they had rushed out on hearing the alarm, they were too far off to  render assistance and, impotent to help, had seen with horror the  terrible death which threatened the ladies.    Frances Hudson had not uttered a word, from the moment when the  Malay rushed down upon them; but as her father came up she turned  round, and burst into tears as he clasped her in his arms.    As soon as it was seen that the Malay was no longer dangerous, the  people poured out again from the houses and shops. It was no very  unusual thing, in Cape Town, for the Malays to run amuck; and many  of those in the streets hurried off, in the direction from which  the man had come, to inquire how many victims had fallen to his  deadly crease, and to see whether any friends were among them. On  the Malay himself no one spared a moment's attention. A second  tremendous blow, with the policeman's club, had dashed out his  brains; for Malays running amuck were always killed upon the spot,  partly in order to save further trouble with them, partly to strike  terror into others.    Many of the bystanders gathered round Reuben, seized him by the  hand, patting him on the shoulder, and praising him for the courage  with which he had faced the maddened savage. A minute later, Mr.  Hudson forced his way through the crowd. Miss Furley had already  been raised, and carried into a shop.    \"Go in with her, my dear,\" Mr. Hudson said to his daughter. \"I will  bring him to you directly.    \"My brave fellow!\" he exclaimed, as he made his way to Reuben and  grasped his hand, \"how can I thank you for saving my child's life?  It seemed to us that she was lost, and that nothing could save her;  when we saw you dash past her, and throw yourself unarmed upon the  madman. It was a noble deed, indeed.    \"You are not badly hurt, I hope,\" he added, as he saw the blood  streaming down Reuben's face and arm.    \"Nothing to speak of, sir,\" Reuben replied. \"At least, I think not;  but I feel rather queer from this loss of blood. I had better get  myself bandaged up.\"    And indeed, Reuben was turning very pale, partly from the  relaxation of the tension of the struggle; partly, as he said, from  loss of blood.    \"Stand back!\" Mr. Hudson cried, \"don't press upon him. The lad is  nearly fainting. One of you help me get him into a shop. Where is  the nearest surgeon to be found?\"    It was as much as Reuben could do to walk across the street, aided  by his two supporters. A strong glass of Cape smoke (as the native  spirit is called) and water revived him somewhat. It was some  minutes before a surgeon arrived; for five persons had been  terribly wounded, and two killed by the Malay on his course, and  the surgeons near were busily employed.    \"Not very serious,\" the surgeon said, as soon as he examined  Reuben's wounds. \"Very different affairs from those I have just  come from.\"    \"I had hold of his hand,\" Reuben said, \"so that he couldn't strike.  They are only cuts he made in trying to get his arm free.\"    \"That on your arm will not trouble you, though it has bled pretty  freely. The one down your face is, fortunately, of no great  consequence; except that it has cut down to the bone on the brow  and cheek. If it had been an inch further back, it would have  severed the temporal artery. You have had a narrow escape of it. As  it is, you will get off with a scar, which may last for some time;  but as it is an honourable one, perhaps you won't so much care.  However, I will bring it together as well as I can, and stitch it  up, and it may not show much.\"    The wound was sewn up and then bandaged, as was that on the arm.  The other and slighter wounds were simply drawn together by slips  of plaster. When all was done, Reuben said to Mr. Hudson:    \"I shall do very well now, sir. I am sure you must wish to go to  Miss Hudson. I will sit here a bit longer, and then go on board the  ship.\"    \"You will do nothing of the kind,\" Mr. Hudson said. \"I have just  sent for a vehicle, and you will come to the hotel and get into bed  at once. You are not fit to stand now, but I hope a good night's  rest will do you good.\"    Reuben would have protested, but at this moment a vehicle arrived  at the door, and with it Captain Wilson entered.    \"I have just taken your daughter and Miss Furley to the hotel,  Hudson,\" he said. \"They are both greatly shaken, and no wonder. So  I thought it better to see them back, before coming in to shake  hands with our gallant young friend here.\"    \"He has lost a good deal of blood, Wilson; and I am just taking him  off, to get him to bed in the hotel.    \"So we won't do any thanking till the morning,\" Mr. Hudson said,  seeing that Reuben's lip quivered, and he was incapable of bearing  any further excitement. \"Do you take one of his arms and I will  take the other, and get him into that trap.\"    A quarter of an hour later, Reuben was in bed at the hotel. Mr.  Hudson brought him up a basin of clear soup. Having drunk this, he  turned over and was, in a very few minutes, asleep. The captain and  most of the other passengers were at the same hotel, and there was  great excitement when the news arrived of the terrible danger the  two girls had run. Mrs. Hudson had, from her early life, been  accustomed to emergencies; and the instant the girls arrived she  took them up to the room they shared between them, and insisted  upon their going at once to bed, after partaking of a cup of tea.    \"What am I to do for this young fellow, Wilson?\" Mr. Hudson asked  as, having seen his patient comfortably in bed, he returned  downstairs, and took a seat in the verandah by his fellow  passenger. \"I owe Frances' life to him, and there is nothing I  wouldn't do for him. The question is, what? One does not like to  offer money to a man, for such a service as this.\"    \"No,\" Mr. Wilson agreed, \"especially in his case. The young fellow  appears to me very much above his condition. Your daughter first  pointed it out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#19)"],[1,"understanding in the slightest  what to make of it, Martha ran to the boudoir, where her heart almost  sprang out of her body at the spectacle of her sister Mary stretched  at full length on the floor, her cheeks ashy pale, her lips blue.  Martha at once made a frantic rush to the bell, and, in a few minutes,  half the establishment, headed by Mr. Whittingen, poured into the  room. With the aid of a little cold water, Mary speedily recovered,  and, in reply to the anxious inquiries of her sympathetic rescuers as  to what had happened, indignantly demanded why such a horrible  looking creature as \"that\" piper had been allowed not merely to enter  the house but to come up to her room, and half frighten her to death.  \"I had just got my album,\" she added, \"when, feeling some one was in  the room, I turned round--and there (she indicated a spot on the  carpet) was the piper, not ten paces away from me, regarding me with  the most awful look imaginable. I was too taken aback with surprise to  say anything, nor--for some unaccountable reason--could I escape,  before he touched me on the shoulder with one of his icy cold hands,  and then commenced playing. Up and down the floor he paced, backwards  and forwards, never taking his hateful glance off my face and ever  piping the same dismal dirge. At last, unable to stand the strain of  it any longer, and convinced he was a madman, bent on murdering  me--for who but a lunatic would behave in such a way?--I gave way to a  violent fit of hysterics, and fainted. Now tell me who he was, and why  he was permitted to frighten me in this manner?\" And Mary stamped her  feet and grew vicious, as only her class will when they are at all  vexed. Her speech was followed by a silence that exasperated her. She  repeated her inquiries with crimson cheeks, and then, as again no one  responded, she signalled out the head footman and raved at him. Up to  this point Mr. Whittingen had been dumb with amazement. The idea of a  strange piper having the twofold effrontery to enter his house and  proceed to the private and chaste sanctuary of his highly respectable  daughters, almost deprived him of breath. He could scarcely believe  his ears. \"What--what in the name of--what does it all mean?\" he at  length stammered, addressing the unfortunate footman. \"A piper! and  without any invitation from me, how dare you let him in?\"    \"I did not, sir,\" the luckless footman replied; \"no such person came  to the door when I was in the hall.\"    \"No more he did when I was there,\" chimed in the second footman, and  all the other servants vociferated in a body, \"We never saw any piper,  sir, nor heard one either,\" and they looked at Mary reproachfully.    At this Mr. Whittingen looked exceedingly embarrassed. In the face of  such a unanimous denial what could he say? He knew if he suggested  the servants were untruthful they would all give notice to leave on  the spot, and knowing good servants are scarce in Perth as elsewhere,  he felt rather in a fix. At length, turning to Mary, he asked if she  was sure it was a piper. \"Sure!\" Mary screamed, \"why, of course I am,  did I not tell you he marched up and down here playing on his  disgusting bagpipes, which nearly broke the drum of my ear.\"    \"And I saw him too, pa,\" Martha put in. \"I met him in the corridor, he  had his pipes under his arm, and the most dreadful expression in his  face. I don't wonder Mary was frightened.\"    \"But where did he go?\" Mr. Whittingen cried.    \"You would not believe me if I told you,\" Martha said, her cheeks  flushing. \"He seemed to pass right through me, and then to vanish  through the staircase window. I have never been so terribly upset in  my life,\" and, sinking on to the sofa, she began to laugh  hysterically.    \"Dear me! dear me! it is very odd!\" Mr. Whittingen exclaimed, as Mary  handed her sister a wineglass of sal-volatile. \"They can't both have  been dreaming; it must--but there, what a nonsensical notion, there  are no such things as ghosts! Only children and nursemaids believe in  them nowadays. As soon as you have quite recovered, my dears, we will  return to the garden, and I think that under the circumstances, the  rather peculiar circumstances, ahem! it will be better to say nothing  to your mother. Do you understand?\" Mr. Whittingen went on, eyeing the  servants, \"Nothing to your mistress.\"    The affair thus terminated, and for some days nothing further happened  to disturb the peace of the family. At the end of a week, however,  exactly a week after the appearance of the piper, Mary met with a  serious accident. She was running across the croquet lawn to speak to  her sister-in-law, when she tripped over a hoop that had been  accidentally left there, and, in falling, ran a hatpin into her head.  Blood poisoning ensued, and within a fortnight she was dead. Martha  was the only one in the house, however, who associated Mary's accident  and death with the piper; to her that sinister expression in the  mysterious Highlander's eyes portended mischief, and she could not  but suspect that, in some way or another, he had brought about the  catastrophe. The autumn waned, and Christmas was well within sight,  when another mysterious occurrence took place. It was early one Sunday  evening, tea was just over, and the Whittingen family were sitting  round the fire engaged in a somewhat melancholy conversation, for the  loss of Mary had affected them all very deeply, when they heard the  far-away rumble of a heavy coach on the high-road. Nearer and nearer  it came, till it seemed to be about on a level with the front lodge  gate; then to their surprise there was a loud crunching of gravel, and  they heard it careering at a breakneck speed up the carriage-drive.  They looked at one another in the utmost consternation.    \"A coach, and driven in this mad fashion! Whose was it? What did it  mean? Not visitors, surely!\"    It pulled up at the front door, and the champing and stamping of the  horses vibrated loudly through the still night air. Sounds as of one  or more people descending were next heard, and then there came a  series of the most terrific knockings at the door. The Whittingen  family stared at one another aghast; there was something in those  knockings--something they could not explain--that struck terror in  their souls and made their blood run cold. They waited in breathless  anxiety for the door to be opened; but no servant went to open it. The  knocks were repeated, if anything louder than before, the door swung  back on its hinges, and the tread of heavy footsteps were heard slowly  approaching the drawing-room. Mrs. Whittingen gave a low gasp of  horror, Ruth screamed, Harvey buried his face in his hands, Mr.  Whittingen rose to his feet, and made desperate efforts to get to the  bell, but could not stir, whilst Martha rushed to the drawing-room  door and locked it. They then with one accord began to pray. The steps  halted outside the room, the door slowly opened, and the blurred  outlines of a group of ghastly-looking figures, supporting a  grotesquely shaped object in their midst, appeared on the threshold.  For some seconds there was a grim silence. It was abruptly broken by a  thud--Ruth had slipped from her chair to the floor in a dead faint;  whereupon the shadowy forms solemnly veered round and made their way  back again to the front door. The latter swung violently open, there  was a rush of icy wind which swept like a hurricane across the hall  and into the drawing-room, the front door then slammed to with a  crash, and the coach drove away.    Every one's attention was now directed to Ruth. At first sal-volatile  and cold water produced no effect, but after a time she slowly, very  slowly regained consciousness. As soon as she had recovered  sufficiently to speak, she expressed an earnest desire that no  reference should ever be made in her presence to what had just  happened. \"It was for me!\" she said in such an emphatic tone as filled  her audience with the direst forebodings. \"I know it was for me; they  all looked in my direction. God help me! I shall die like Mary.\"    Though greatly perplexed as to what she meant, for no one excepting  herself had been able to make out the phenomena with any degree of  distinctness, they yielded to her entreaties, and asked her no  questions. The servants had neither heard nor seen anything. A  fortnight later, Ruth was taken ill with appendicitis; peritonitis  speedily set in, and she died under the operation. The Whittingens now  began to wish they had never come to Donaldgowerie; but, with the  astuteness that had been characteristic of the family through  countless generations of fair days and foul, they took the greatest  precautions never to drop even as much as a hint to the servants or to  any one in the town that the house was haunted.    A year passed without any further catastrophe, and they were beginning  to hope their ghastly visitors had left them, when something else  occurred. It was Easter-time, and Ernest, his wife, and baby were  staying with them. The baby, a boy, was fat and bonny, the very  picture of health and happiness.    Mrs. Whittingen and Martha vied with one another in their devotion to  him; and either one or other of them was always dancing attendance on  him. It so happened that one afternoon, whilst the servants were  having their tea, Martha found herself alone in the upper part of the  house with her precious nephew. Mr. Whittingen had gone to Edinburgh  to consult his lawyer (the head of the firm with whom Harvey was  articled) on business, whilst Mrs. Whittingen had taken her son and  daughter-in-law for a drive. The weather was glorious, and Martha,  though as little appreciative of the beauties of nature as most  commercial-minded young women, could not but admire the colouring of  the sky as she looked out of the nursery window. The sun had  disappeared, but the effect of its rays was still apparent on the "]]]
