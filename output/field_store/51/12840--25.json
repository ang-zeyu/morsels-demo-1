He felt unusually  complaisant, having succeeded in his designs against our hero.    \"Well, James,\" said Mrs. Crawford, \"you look in better spirits than I  feel.\"    \"What's happened amiss?\"    \"Roswell has given up his place.\"    \"Been discharged, you mean.\"    \"No,\" said Roswell, \"I left the place of my own accord.\"    \"What for?\"    \"I don't like the firm, nor the business. I wish I were in Mr.  Rockwell's.\"    \"Well,\" said Gilbert, \"perhaps I can get you in there.\"    \"Has the boot-black left?\"    \"He's found another place,\" said Gilbert, smiling at what he regarded as  a good joke.    \"You don't mean to say he has left a place where he was earning ten  dollars a week?\" said Mrs. Crawford, in surprise. \"Where is this new  place that you speak of?\"    \"In the station-house.\"    \"Is he in the station-house?\" asked Roswell, eagerly.    \"That is what I hear.\"    \"What's he been doing?\"    \"Charged with picking a pocket.\"    \"Well, I do hope Mr. Rockwell will now see his folly in engaging a boy  from the streets,\" said Mrs. Crawford, charitably concluding that there  was no doubt of our hero's guilt.    \"What'll be done with him, Cousin James?\" asked Roswell.    \"He'll be sent to the Island, I suppose.\"    \"He may get clear.\"    \"I think not. Circumstances are very much against him, I hear.\"    \"And will you try to get me in, Cousin James?\"    \"I'll do what I can. Perhaps it may be well for you to drop in to-morrow  about ten o'clock.\"    \"All right,--I'll do it.\"    Both Mrs. Crawford's and Roswell's spirits revived wonderfully, and Mr.  Gilbert, too, seemed unusually lively. And all because poor Dick had got  into difficulties, and seemed in danger of losing both his place and his  good name.    \"It's lucky I left Hall & Turner's just as I did!\" thought Roswell,  complacently. \"May be they'd like to engage the boot-black when he gets  out of prison. But I guess he'll have to go back to blacking boots.  That's what he's most fit for.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    DICK'S ACQUITTAL.      After his interview with Mr. Murdock and Henry Fosdick, Dick felt  considerably relieved. He not only saw that his friends were convinced  of his innocence, but, through Tim Ryan's testimony, he saw that there  was a reasonable chance of getting clear. He had begun to set a high  value on respectability, and he felt that now he had a character to  sustain.    The night wore away at last. The pallet on which he lay was rather hard;  but Dick had so often slept in places less comfortable that he cared  little for that. When he woke up, he did not at first remember where he  was, but he very soon recalled the circumstances, and that his trial was  close at hand.    \"I hope Mr. Murdock won't oversleep himself,\" thought our hero. \"If he  does, it'll be a gone case with me.\"    At an early hour the attendant of the police station went the rounds,  and Dick was informed that he was wanted. Brief space was given for the  arrangement of the toilet. In fact, those who avail themselves of the  free lodgings provided at the station-house rarely pay very great  attention to their dress or personal appearance. Dick, however, had a  comb in his pocket, and carefully combed his hair. He also brushed off  his coat as well as he could; he also critically inspected his shoes,  not forgetting his old professional habits.    \"I wish I had a brush and some blackin',\" he said to himself. \"My shoes  would look all the better for a good shine.\"    But time was up, and, under the escort of a policeman, Dick was conveyed  to the Tombs. Probably all my readers have heard of this building. It is  a large stone building, with massive columns, broad on the ground, but  low. It is not only used for a prison, but there are two rooms on the  first floor used for the holding of courts. Into the larger one of these  Dick was carried. He looked around him anxiously, and to his great joy  perceived that not only Mr. Murdock was on hand, but honest Tim Ryan,  whose testimony was so important to his defence. Dick was taken forward  to the place provided for those awaiting trial, and was obliged to await  his turn. One or two cases, about which there was no doubt, including  the colored woman arrested for drunkenness, were summarily disposed of,  and the next case was called. The policeman who had arrested Dick  presented himself with our hero.    Dick was so neatly dressed, and looked so modest and self-possessed,  that the judge surveyed him with some surprise.    \"What is this lad charged with?\" he demanded.    \"With taking a wallet from a gentleman's pocket,\" said the policeman.    \"Did you arrest him?\"    \"I did.\"    \"Did you take him in the act?\"    \"No; I did not see him take it.\"    \"What have you to say, prisoner? Are you guilty or not guilty?\" said the  judge, turning to Dick.    \"Not guilty,\" said Dick, quietly.    \"State why you made the arrest,\" said the judge.    \"I saw him with the wallet in his hand.\"    \"Is the gentleman who had his pocket picked, present?\"    \"He is.\"    \"Summon him.\"    The red-faced man came forward, and gave his testimony. He stated that  he was standing on the sidewalk, when he felt a hand thrust into his  pocket, and forcibly withdrawn. He immediately felt for his wallet, and  found it gone. Turning, he saw a boy running, and immediately gave  chase.    \"Was the boy you saw running the prisoner?\"    \"I suppose it was.\"    \"You suppose? Don't you know?\"    \"Of course it was, or he would not have been found with the wallet in  his hand.\"    \"But you cannot identify him from personal observation?\"    The red-faced man admitted with some reluctance that his eyesight was  very poor, and he did not catch sight of the boy till he was too far off  to be identified.    \"This is not so clear as it might be,\" said the judge. \"Still,  appearances are against the prisoner, and as the wallet was found in his  possession, he must be found guilty, unless that fact can be  satisfactorily explained.\"    \"I have a witness who can explain it,\" said Dick.    \"Where is he?\"    Tim Ryan, who understood that his evidence was now wanted, came forward.    After being sworn, the judge asked, \"What is your name?\"    \"Tim Ryan, sir.\"    \"Where do you live?\"    \"In Mulberry Street.\"    \"Tell what you know of this case.\"    \"I was standing in Chatham Street, when I saw the ould gintleman with  the red face (here the prosecutor scowled at Tim, not relishing the  description which was given of him) standing at the corner of Pearl  Street. A boy came up, and put his hand into his pocket, and then run  away as fast as his legs could carry him, wid the wallet in his hand.\"    \"Who was this boy? Do you know him?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Tell his name.\"    \"It was Micky Maguire,\" said Tim, reluctantly.    \"And who is Micky Maguire?\"    \"He blacks boots.\"    \"Then if this Micky Maguire took the wallet, how happened it that it was  found in this boy's possession?\"    \"I can tell that,\" said Tim. \"I ran after Micky to see if he'd get off  wid the wallet. He hadn't gone but a little way when I saw him slip it  into Dick's pocket.\"    \"I suppose you mean by Dick, the prisoner at the bar?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And what became of this Micky?\"    \"He stopped runnin' after he'd got rid of the pocket-book, and a minute  after, up came the 'copp,' and took Dick.\"    \"Why didn't you come forward, and explain the mistake?\"    \"I was afraid Micky'd beat me.\"    \"Do you know this Micky Maguire?\" said the judge, turning to the  officer.    \"I do.\"    \"What is his reputation?\"    \"Bad. He's been at the Island three or four times already.\"    \"Did you see him anywhere about when you made the arrest?\"    \"I did.\"    \"Do you know this boy who has just testified?\"    \"Yes. He is a good boy.\"    \"The case seems a clear one. The prisoner is discharged from custody.  Arrest Micky Maguire on the same charge as early as possible.\"    The next case was called, and Dick was free.    Mr. Murdock came forward, and took him by the hand, which he shook  heartily.    \"I congratulate you on your acquittal,\" he said.    \"I feel a little better than I did,\" said Dick. \"Tim, you're a good  fellow,\" he said, clasping Tim's hand. \"I wouldn't have got off, if it  hadn't been for you.\"    \"I ought to do that much for you, Dick, when you've been so kind to me.\"    \"How are you getting along now, Tim?\"    \"Pretty well. Mother's got so she can work and we're doin' well. When  she was sick, it was pretty hard.\"    \"Here's something to help you along,\" said Dick, and he drew a bill from  his pocket.    \"Five dollars!\" said Tim, in surprise.    \"You can buy some new clothes, Tim.\"    \"I ought not to take so much as that, Dick.\"    \"It's all right, Tim. There's some more where that comes from.\"    They were in Centre Street by this time. Fosdick came up hurriedly.    \"Have you got off, Dick?\" he asked, eagerly.    \"Yes, Fosdick. There's no chance of my being entertained at the expense  of the city.\"    \"I didn't expect the trial was coming off so early. Tell me all about  it.\"    \"What did they say at the house at my being away?\" asked Dick.    \"Miss Peyton inquired particularly after you. I said, as you directed  me, that you were detained by important business.\"    \"What did she say then?\"    Dick was so particular in his inquiries, fearing lest any suspicion  should have been formed of the real cause which had detained him. There  was no reason for it; but it had always been a matter of pride with him  in his vagabond days that he had never been arrested on any charge, and  it troubled him that he should even have been suspected of theft.    \"You are fishing for compliments, Dick,\" said Fosdick.    \"How do you make that out?\"    \"You want to know what Miss Peyton said. I believe you are getting  interested in her.\"    \"When I am, just send me to a lunatic asylum,\" said Dick.    \"I am afraid you are getting sarcastic, Dick. However, not to keep you  in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#19)"],[1,"in the midst of the assembled  family, with the foreign princes grouped in a semicircle around, the  bride-elect leaning on her father's arm and blushingly receiving the  congratulations of all present. In the two days preceding his  birthday, the Emperor received not only his royal visitors, but the  representatives of Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Servia, Japan, and China.  The Old Schloss, with its six hundred apartments and reception-rooms,  was used for the entertainment of royal guests. All the sunny south  windows facing the Schloss Platz rejoiced for days beforehand in open  draperies and freshly cleaned plate glass, giving an unwonted look of  cheer and human habitableness to the majestic and venerable pile  through which we had walked, a few weeks before, with hushed voices  and muffled footsteps, gazing on the rich decorations of the public  rooms, the glittering candelabra, the silver balustrades, the ancient  plate, the historic paintings and monuments which recall past  centuries and vanished sovereigns.    But the streets witnessed the most memorable scenes. On the eve of the  birthday a torchlight procession of more than six thousand students  represented the Universities of Berlin, Bonn, Heidelberg, Jena,  Koenigsberg, Leipzig, Marburg, Munich, Strasburg, and others; the  Polytechnic Schools of Berlin, Brunswick, Darmstadt, Dresden, Hanover,  Karlsruhe, and Stuttgardt; the Mining Academies of Berlin, Clausthal,  and Freiberg; and the Agricultural Schools of Berlin, Eberswalde, and  Tharandt. Opposite the Imperial Palace stands the University,--formerly  the palace of Prince Henry,--amid old trees and gardens, and with the  fine colossal statues of the brothers Humboldt in white marble, sitting  on massive pedestals on either side the main gateway. This was the  starting-point of the great procession, which was led by two mounted  students in the garb of Wallenstein's soldiers. Five abreast the  torch-bearers approached the Emperor's palace, and before his windows  the Ziethen Hussars wheeled in and out in mystic evolutions. A  labyrinthine series of movements, marked in the darkness only by the  flaming torches, was executed in perfect silence; then a simple hymn of  the Middle Ages was sung with singular effect by these thousands of  young and manly voices; and from the silence which succeeded, at the  call of a student standing in the midst and waving his sword above his  head, there arose a \"Three cheers for the Emperor!\" while six thousand  torches swung to and fro, and hundreds of flags and ancient banners  waved in the evening air. Again there was silence, when one struck the  National Anthem, which was sung with all heads uncovered, the aged hero  bowing low at his window in acknowledgment until emotion obliged him to  withdraw. An incident soon on every tongue was the Emperor's sending  for a deputation of the students to wait on him, his kind reception of  and conversation with them, and their elation at the honor,  notwithstanding their mortification at the contrast of the smoke-soiled  hands and faces of the torch-bearers with the brilliance of the  Imperial chamber and the full dress of distinguished visitors. Leaving  the Emperor's palace, the procession passed through Unter den Linden  and the Brandenburg Gate to the Thiergarten, where amid a dense and  surging throng the students threw their burning torches in a heap and  sang over the expiring flames, \"Gaudeamus igitur juvenes dum sumus.\"  Deputies from all the Universities, dressed in black velvet coats, high  boots, and plumed hats, and bearing fine swords, brought up the rear of  the procession in thirty carriages, with the flags of the old German  towns and Universities floating above them. I watched this torchlight  procession from a second-story window-seat on Unter den Linden, and was  much impressed with the general view, extending from the equestrian  statue of Frederick the Great before the Emperor's palace, where the  entire area was filled with reflected light, for nearly a mile to the  Brandenburg Gate, the various forms of the waving torches on the long  line seeming the very apotheosis of flame. Many of the young men were  dressed in the picturesque taste peculiar to German students. Gay  feathers and unique caps set off to advantage the fine features and  fair complexions which render some of the students remarkable, though  the faces are too often disfigured by tell-tale sabre-cuts. After the  passing of the procession, we drove through a portion of the Potsdamer  Strasse where the lamps were rather infrequent and the overarching  branches of the trees shut out the starlight from the handsome street.  Crowds were hurrying to and fro,--but to this we had become  accustomed,--when suddenly we met a company of mounted students  returning from the park. In white wigs and high-peaked caps,  close-fitting white suits embroidered with gold, brilliant sashes, and  top-boots, they looked, in the dim light, like knights of the Middle  Ages returning from some quest or tournament; and as they slowly filed  by, bowing to the greetings of the passers, it was hard to believe for  the moment that they were other than they seemed.    The morning of the birthday dawned bright and beautiful. \"Emperor's  weather this,\" the Germans fondly said. Before we left our  breakfast-room the sound of chimes was calling all the children of the  city to the churches for their share of the celebration. From my  window I saw at one time three large processions of children passing  in different directions through diverging streets. All were marshalled  by teachers from the public schools in strictest order, and with fine  brass bands playing choral music as they entered the church. Here the  pastor, after prayer, addressed the children on the blessings of peace  and the life of the good Emperor, and the children sang, as only  German children can, the patriotic songs of their country. No more  touching sight was seen that day than these thousands of boys and  girls passing into the churches, with the sound of solemn music, to  thank God for the blessings of Fatherland and Emperor,--a scene which  caused tears to roll down the cheeks of many a spectator. It will be  hard to uproot German patriotism while its future fathers and mothers  are thus trained.    While the children were marching, another procession was also passing,  composed of the magistrates and city officials, going to the Nicolai  Kirche (the oldest church in Berlin) for a similar service. Every one  was astir early, and before ten o'clock a dense crowd filled the  streets. Horses, omnibuses, and tram-cars were garlanded and decorated  with flags, and the house fronts were bewildering in color and  decorations. The double-headed eagle, signifying in the heraldry of  Germany the Empire of Charlemagne and that of the Caesars, was  everywhere intermingled with the German tri-color of red, white, and  black, with the black and white of Prussia, the green of Saxony, the  blue of Bavaria, and the orange, purple, and other colors of the  various principalities and powers of the German Empire; hardly a house  lacking some brilliant flutter of symbolic colors. Only an American in  a foreign land can know how welcome was the sight of \"the stars and  stripes\" floating majestically from two or three points on the route;  though in one case it was flanked by the crescent and star of the  Turkish Empire, and in another contrasted with the blue dragon on a  yellow ground which formed the triangular flag of China. Miles of  business thoroughfares showed glittering and artistic arrangements in  the shop windows; nearly every one having its picture, bust, or statue  of the Emperor,--some with most elaborate and expensive designs.  Between ten and eleven A.M. the deputations from the Universities  passed through Unter den Linden, making a daylight parade but little  inferior to that of the evening before. The dense throng immediately  closed in after the procession, but by great efforts the mounted  police cleared a passage for the State carriages to the palace of the  Emperor. At eleven o'clock a magnificent royal carriage drew up at the  palace of the Crown Prince, who entered it, accompanied by the Crown  Princess and two daughters. They proceeded to the presence of the  Emperor, to offer the first congratulations. Next came a carriage  whose splendid accompaniments eclipsed all others. Preceded by a  mounted herald in scarlet and silver, on a mettled and caparisoned  steed, and by other outriders in the same glittering fashion, came the  carriage, surmounted by silver crowns, drawn by six horses; carriage,  steeds, coachman, and footmen in shining livery and flowing plumes. At  the door of the Crown Prince's palace the stout figure of the Prince  of Wales, in comparatively plain attire, stepped into this coach; a  lady was handed in after him, and the splendid equipage rolled toward  the Emperor's palace, amid the cheers of the multitude. From the Old  Schloss, a succession of royal carriages passed in the same direction,  all glittering in silver and gold and flowing with plumes, many with  four or six horses; until fully fifty State carriages had deposited  their occupants at the palace of the Kaiser, and awaited, in the fine  open spaces around the famous equestrian statue of Frederick the  Great, the return of royalty from its congratulations to the venerable  object of all this attention. Many of the royal visitors were known by  sight to the crowd, as Berlin sees much of royalty; but many were not.  The cheering was not enthusiastic, except in special cases. \"Who is  that?\" said one near me, as a splendid carriage passed. \"I do not  know,\" replied another man; \"it is only one of those kings.\" But when  the Crown Prince Frederick returned from his call, \"This is something  else,\" said the proud German heart; and the cheers were deafening. The  greatest enthusiasm of the day was shown"]]]
