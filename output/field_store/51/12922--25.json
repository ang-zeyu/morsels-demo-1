The company captain, at sight of a knot of his men dashing at breakneck  speed toward the boulders, started at a more leisurely pace in the same  direction.    Mahan had reached the edge of the rocks when his ears were greeted by a  yell of mortal fear. The captain and the rest, catching the sound, went  faster. Screech after screech rang from the rocky enclosure.    Mahan rounded the big boulder at the crest of the ridge and flung  himself upon the two combatants, as they thrashed about in a tumultuous  dual mass on the ground. And just then Bruce at last found his grip on  Stolz's throat.    A stoical German signal-corps officer, on a hilltop some miles to  eastward, laid aside his field-glass and calmly remarked to a man at  his side    \"We have lost a good spy!\"    Such was the sole epitaph and eulogy of Herr Heinrich Stolz, from his  army.    Meantime, Sergeant Mahan was prying loose the collie's ferocious jaws  from their prey and was tugging with all his might to drag the dog off  the shrieking spy. The throat-hold, he noted, was a bare inch from the  jugular.    The rest of the soldiers, rushing up pell-mell, helped him pull the  infuriated Bruce from his victim. The spectacle of their admired  dog-hero, so murderously mauling a woman of the Red Cross, dazed them  with horror.    \"Take him AWAY!\" bellowed Stolz, delirious with pain and fear. \"He's  KILLED me--der gottverdammte Teufelhund!\"    And now the crazed victim's unconscious use of German was not needed to  tell every one within hearing just who and what he was. For the  quavering tones were no longer a rich contralto. They were a throaty  baritone. And the accent was Teutonic.    \"Bruce!\" observed Top-Sergeant Mahan next morning, \"I've always said a  man who kicks a dog is more of a cur than the dog is. But you'll never  know how near I came to kicking you yesterday, when I caught you  mangling that filthy spy. And Brucie, if I had kicked you, well--I'd be  praying at this minute that the good Lord would grow a third leg on me,  so that I could kick myself all the way from here to Berlin!\"        CHAPTER VI. The Werewolf    When Bruce left the quiet peace of The Place for the hell of the  Western Front, it had been stipulated by the Mistress and the Master  that if ever he were disabled, he should be shipped back to The Place,  at their expense.    It was a stipulation made rather to soothe the Mistress's sorrow at  parting from her loved pet than in any hope that it could be fulfilled;  for the average life of a courierdog on the battle-front was tragically  short. And his fate was more than ordinarily certain. If the boche  bullets and shrapnel happened to miss him, there were countless  diseases--bred of trench and of hardship and of abominable food--to  kill him.    The Red Cross appeal raised countless millions of dollars and brought  rescue to innumerable human warriors. But in caring for humans, the  generosity of most givers reached its limit; and the Blue Cross--\"for  the relief of dogs and horses injured in the service of the  Allies\"--was forced to take what it could get. Yet many a man, and many  a body of men, owed life and safety to the heroism of some war-dog, a  dog which surely merited special care when its own certain hour of  agony struck.    Bruce's warmest overseas friends were to be found in the ranks of the  mixed Franco-American regiment, nicknamed the \"Here-We-Comes.\" Right  gallantly, in more than one tight place, had Bruce been of use to the  \"Here-We-Comes.\" On his official visits to the regiment, he was always  received with a joyous welcome that would have turned any head less  steady than a thoroughbred collie's.    Bruce enjoyed this treatment. He enjoyed, too, the food-dainties  wherewith the \"Here-We-Comes\" plied him. But to no man in the army  would he give the adoring personal loyalty he had left at The Place  with the Mistress and the Master. Those two were still his only gods.  And he missed them and his sweet life at The Place most bitterly. Yet  he was too good a soldier to mope.          *      *      *      *      *    For months the \"Here-We-Comes\" had been quartered in a \"quiet\"--or only  occasionally tumultuous--sector, near Chateau-Thierry. Then the  comparative quiet all at once turned to pandemonium.    A lanky and degenerate youth (who before the war had been unlovingly  known throughout Europe as the \"White Rabbit\" and who now was mentioned  in dispatches as the \"Crown Prince\") had succeeded in leading some  half-million fellow-Germans into a \"pocket\" that had lately been merely  a salient.    From the three lower sides of the pocket, the Allies ecstatically flung  themselves upon their trapped foes in a laudable effort to crush the  half-million boches and their rabbit-faced princeling into surrender  before the latter could get out of the snare, and to the shelter of the  high ground and the reenforcements that lay behind it. The Germans  objected most strenuously to this crushing process. And the three  beleaguered edges of the pocket became a triple-section of hell.    It was a period when no one's nerves were in any degree normal--least  of all the nerves of the eternally hammered Germans. Even the fiercely  advancing Franco-Americans, the \"Here-We-Comes,\" had lost the grimly  humorous composure that had been theirs, and waxed sullen and ferocious  in their eagerness.    Thus it was that Bruce missed his wontedly uproarious welcome as he  cantered, at sunset one July day, into a smashed farmstead where his  friends, the \"Here-We-Comes,\" were bivouacked for the night. By  instinct, the big dog seemed to know where to find the temporary  regimental headquarters.    He trotted past a sentry, into an unroofed cattle-shed where the  colonel was busily scribbling a detailed report of the work done by the  \"Here-We-Comes\" during that day's drive.    Coming to a halt by the colonel's side, Bruce stood expectantly wagging  his plumy tail and waiting for the folded message from division  headquarters to be taken off his collar.    Usually, on such visits, the colonel made much of the dog. To-day he  merely glanced up abstractedly from his writing, at sight of Bruce's  silken head at his side. He unfastened the message, read it, frowned  and went on with his report.    Bruce continued to wag his tail and to look up wistfully for the wonted  petting and word of commendation. But the colonel had forgotten his  existence. So presently the collie wearied of waiting for a caress from  a man whose caresses, at best, he did not greatly value. He turned and  strolled out of the shed. His message delivered, he knew he was at  liberty to amuse himself as he might choose to, until such time as he  must carry back to his general a reply to the dispatch he had brought.    From outside came the voices of tired and lounging soldiers. A  traveling kitchen had just been set up near by. From it arose a blend  of smells that were mighty tempting to a healthily hungry dog. Thither,  at a decorous but expectant pace, Bruce bent his steps.    Top-Sergeant Mahan was gazing with solicitous interest upon the toil of  the cooks at the wheeled kitchen. Beside him, sharing his concern in  the supper preparations, was Mahan's closest crony, old Sergeant  Vivier. The wizened little Frenchman, as a boy, had been in the  surrender of Sedan. Nightly, ever since, he had besought the saints to  give him, some day, a tiny share in the avenging of that black disgrace.    Mahan and Vivier were the warmest of Bruce's many admirers in the  \"Here-We-Comes.\" Ordinarily a dual whoop of joy from them would have  greeted his advent. This afternoon they merely chirped abstractedly at  him, and Mahan patted him carelessly on the head before returning to  the inspection of the cooking food.    Since an hour before dawn, both men had been in hot action. The command  for the \"Here-We-Comes\" to turn aside and bivouac for the night had  been a sharp disappointment to them, as well as to every unwounded man  in the regiment.    When a gambler is in the middle of a winning streak, when an athlete  feels he has the race in his own hands, when a business man has all but  closed the deal that means fortune to him--at such crises it is  maddening to be halted at the very verge of triumph. But to soldiers  who, after months of reverses, at last have their hated foe on the run,  such a check does odd things to temper and to nerves.    In such plight were the men of the \"Here-We-Comes,\" on this late  afternoon. Mahan and Vivier were too seasoned and too sane to give way  to the bursts of temper and the swirls of blasphemy that swayed so many  of their comrades. Nevertheless they were glum and silent and had no  heart for jolly welcomings,--even to so dear a friend as Bruce.    Experience told them that a square meal would work miracles in the way  of calming and bracing them. Hence, apart from stark hunger, their  interest in the cooking of supper.    Bruce was too much a philosopher--and not devoted enough to his soldier  friends--to be hurt at the lack of warmth in the greeting. With the air  of an epicure, he sniffed at the contents of one of the kitchen's  bubbling kettles. Then he walked off and curled himself comfortably on  a pile of bedding, there to rest until supper should be ready.    Several times, as he lay there, soldiers passed and repassed. One or  two of them snapped their fingers at the dog or even stooped, in  passing, to stroke his head. But on the faces of all of them was unrest  and a certain wolfish eagerness, which precluded playing with pets at  such a time. The hot zest of the man-hunt was upon them. It was gnawing  in the veins of the newest recruit, ever, as in the heart of the  usually self-contained colonel of the regiment.    The colonel, in fact, had been so carried away by the joy of seeing his  men drive the hated graycoats before"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#19)"],[1,"ontents. On the floor reposed countless shattered articles of glass  and porcelain; jumbled together with blotters an pastepot and shears  and ink-stand and other utensils. Ink had been poured in grotesque  pattern on rugs and parquetry and window curtains.    In one corner lay a typewriter, its keys twisted and its carriage  broken. Books--some of them in rare bindings,--lay gutted and  ink-smeared, from one end of the place to the other.    Through the daze of general horror boomed the tremblingly majestic  voice of Rutherford Garretse.    \"I wanted you to see!\" he declaimed. \"I ordered everything left as it  was. That mess of papers all over the floor is what remains of the  first draft of my book. The book I have been at work on for six months!  I--\"    \"And it was the dog, there!\" sputtered the maid-servant; emotion riding  over discipline. \"I c'n swear the room was neat and all dusted. Not a  blessed thing out of place; and all the paper where Mr. Garretse had  stacked 'em in his portfolio, yonder. I dusted this study and then the  dining room. And then I went out to sweep the veranda; like I always  do, before breakfast. And maybe ten minutes later I see this brute trot  out of Mr. Harmon's place, and along the road, and come, asnuffing up  the steps and into the house. And when I followed him upstairs and  scatted him out, I saw the room looking like it is, now; and I yells to  Mr. Garretse, and he's shaving, and--\"    \"That will do, Esther!\" snapped the author. \"And, now, sir--\"    \"But, Mr. Garretse,\" put in the Mistress, \"Lad never did such a thing  as this, in all his life! He's been brought up in the house. Even as a  puppy, he was--\"    \"The evidence shows otherwise,\" interrupted Garretse, with a visible  struggle at self-control. \"No human, unless he were a maniac, would  have done such a wantonly destructive thing. No other animal has been  here. The dog was seen entering and leaving this room. And my work of  six months is not only destroyed by him, but many of the very best  pieces in my glass-and-porcelain cabinet.\"    \"But--\"    \"I consented to stay on at Daylight Park, only on the solemn assurance  of the Governors that no animal should be allowed again within the Park  precincts. I detest animals. Particularly dogs. And now I see my  dislike is not mere prejudice. May I ask what the owners and--and the  harborer--of the cur mean to do about this outrage? Notice, please,  that I am speaking with studied moderation, in asking this vital  question. I--\"    \"It is my fault,--or rather, it is a mistake,--that Lad is in the  Park,\" spoke up the Master. \"Mr. Harmon is wholly innocent in the  matter. I can testify to that. If there is any fine or other penalty in  connection with my dog's being here, I'm ready to settle for it. But if  you expect me to believe that Laddie did all this weird damage to your  manuscript and your collection and your room,--why, that's absurd!  Utterly absurd! Lad, never in his life,--\"    \"The courts will think otherwise!\" blazed Garretse, losing a fraction  of his hard-held selfmastery. \"And the case shall go through every  court in the land, since you persist in this idiotic denial of a proven  fact. I warn you, I shall--Look there!\" he broke off, furiously,  leveling a shakily vehement forefinger at Lad. \"Watch him! He's  prowling around, even now, in search of more things to injure. He--\"    The author finished his sentence by catching up a heavy metal  paperweight and drawing it back as if for a throw. His muscles flexed.  The Mistress moved, as by accident, between the raging man and the dog.    The Master, for the moment, lacked presence of mind to do even that  much for his canine chum's safety. He was too much taken up in glaring  unbelievingly at Lad.    The sedate collie, after following the bevy of excited humans upstairs,  had stood gravely, just inside the threshold; looking with keen  interest from one to the other of the gesticulating and noisy group.  Then, as a sharp whiff of that same baffling scent assailed his nose,  he began a new tour of the room.    The odor was fresher than before. And Lad's curiosity was roused to the  full. He sniffed to right and left, exploring the floor rubbish with  inquiring muzzle, and circling the despoiled writing desk.    It was then that Garretse called attention to him. And it was then that  Lad's nose suddenly pointed skyward. In another moment, he had bounded  eagerly toward one of the windows,--the window that was slightly open  from the top.    From that direction, the scent now came; and it was more potent than at  any earlier time in his quest.    Even as the astonished eyes of the group followed Lad window-ward,  those same eyes were attracted by a partial darkening of the open space  at the window's top.    Into the room, through the narrow aperture wiggled a hairy form, moving  with eel-like speed.    Thence, it leaped to the floor. For the fraction of a second, the  intruder crouched there; peering about, to determine into what company  his jump had landed him.    He was a gray monkey, small, infinitely aged and withered of aspect.  His paws and forearms were black with half-dry ink. Here and there, all  over his fuzzy gray body, ink-blobs were spattered. In one skinny paw  he still clutched the splintered fragment of a Satsuma vase.    By the time the gaping humans could get a single good look at the  monkey, Lad was at him. Here at last was the solution of that  mysterious scent, so new to the collie.    Lad galloped toward the wizened and malodorous gray bunch; more intent  on investigation than on attack. The monkey did not wait for him. With  an incredibly agile leap, he was on the spattered window curtains and  swarming up to the rod at the top. There he squatted, well out of  reach; grimacing horribly and chattering in simian wrath.    \"It's--it's a devil!\" stammered Rutherford Garretse; his nearsighted  eyes squinting as he sought to take in the motley details of the  creature's appearance. \"I--\"    \"It's Mrs. McMurdle's pest of a monkey, sirs\" blithered the maid.  \"Asking your pardon. The one she made such a fuss about sending away,  last month, when all beastees was barred from the Park. It must 'a'  strayed back from where she sent it to, the crafty little nuisance!  It's--\"    \"Incidentally,\" said the Master, \"it is the creature that wrecked your  room. See the ink on it. And that bit of porcelain it's brandishing at  us looks like a match for some of these smashed bits on the floor. It  got in here, I suppose, through that window, earlier,--and--\"    \"No,\" corrected the Mistress, wiser at deduction. \"Through the doorway,  downstairs. From somewhere outside. Probably while the maid was dusting  the dining-room. It came in here and began destroying things; as  monkeys love to. And Laddie struck its trail and followed it up here.  It heard Lad coming and it got out through the window. Then, just now,  something outside scared it; and it climbed back in again. I wonder  if--\"    As she talked, the Mistress had moved toward the nearest window.    \"See?\" she finished, in triumph, as she pointed out and down.    On the patch of back lawn, below, stood a very much flustered old lady,  her worried gaze upraised to the study. In one hand she carried a  leash, in the other a half-peeled banana.    \"It's Mrs. McMurdle!\" exclaimed Harmon. \"The maid was right. She must  have disobeyed the ordinance and had the miserable monkey hidden in her  house all the time. It must have gotten out, this morning; and she  hunted around till she saw it perched on the top of the window cornice.  I suppose it dived back in here, at sight of her. She--\"    \"Come on, Laddie!\" whispered the Mistress, under cover of a new  outbreak of multiple talk. \"YOU'RE acquitted, anyhow. And the rest of  the scene is really no business of ours. The sooner we get you to the  boarding kennels again, the less chance there is of trouble. And Master  and I will come to see you there, every single day, till we go back  home.\"    A week later, the car turned in again at the gates of the Place. This  time, Lad rode in state atop the flat trunk on the rear seat. As the  car halted at the veranda, he sprang to earth without waiting for the  tonneau door to be opened.    For, dashing toward him from the direction of the lake, Lady hove in  sight. Behind her, and trotting more leisurely, came Wolf. At sight and  scent of her returned mate, Lady fairly squealed with delight. She  whirled up to Lad, frantically licking his face and spinning about him  with little staccato yelps of joy.    Lad was deliriously happy. Not only was he at home again; but Lady was  welcoming him with an effusion that she had not shown him for many a  sorrowful month. He could not understand it. Nor did he try to. He was  content to accept the miracle; and to rejoice in it with all his great  honest heart.    Knowing nothing of feminine psychology, he could not realize that a  week of Puppy Wolf's sole and undiluted companionship had bored Lady  horribly and had begun to get on her nerves;--nor that she had learned  to miss and yearn for the big, wise, ever-gentle mate whom she had so  long neglected.    It was enough for Lad to know that he was no longer a neglected  outsider, in the Place's canine family; but that his worshiped mate was  wild with joy to see him again.    \"Look!\" said the Master. \"The old chap has forgiven her for every bit  of her rottenness to him. He's insanely happy, just because she chooses  to make much of him, once more.\"    \"Yes,\" assented the Mistress, cryptically \"Sometimes dogs are  pitifully--human!\"        CHAPTER VI.
