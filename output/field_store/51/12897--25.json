SCIENTIFIC LIVING    =For Prolonging term of Human Life=    The New Domestic Science, Cooking to Simplify Living and Retaining the  Life Elements in Food.    By LAURA NETTLETON BROWN.    A great truth is emphasized in this book, namely, that in the ordinary  processes of cooking the organic elements become inorganic and food  values are destroyed. This dietetic idea is most important, and it is  claimed by the author that when generally known and made practical it  will restore the racial vigor as nothing else can, free woman from the  slavery of the cook stove and become a large factor in the solution of  the servant problem.    The author does more than inform; she arouses and inspires; she also  enters into the practical demonstration of the new way; food tables,  recipes and menus are numerous and enlightening and will prove  exceedingly helpful not only to busy housekeepers, but also to all  persons who desire to get the greatest benefit and fullest enjoyment  from the daily meals.    She refrains from urging the exclusive use of uncooked foods, but shows  what kind of cooking can be made useful. A most interesting and  practical feature of this work is the clear and discriminating  instructions given for the application of heat in preparing food. From  the author's point of view it becomes evident that the present mode of  preparing food is not only unnecessarily laborious, but that it involves  great waste of the raw material and puts a severe tax upon the digestive  organs of the consumer.    The best thing about the new way to many minds, however, will be that it  greatly enhances the appetizing qualities of the viands. It treats of  the chemistry of food in a way that is easily understood and made  practical. The concluding chapter of the book deals with \"Associate  Influences,\" and gives sound advice upon other factors than diet.    The volume is thoroughly sensible and enlightening; original without  being cranky; radical without being faddish;  withal, practical plain and entirely helpful. No one who is interested  in the all-important question of scientific living can afford to be  without this book. It will be found of interest to teachers and students  of domestic economy. It is very carefully and thoroughly indexed, adding  to its usefulness.    Printed on fine paper. Handsomely bound in extra cloth. $1.00 by mail on  receipt of price. If not entirely satisfactory, money will be returned.  Address          The New Internal Bath      The benefits and great importance of properly flushing the colon is now  fully recognized and it has led to a large and increasing demand for  syringes used for this purpose. The appliances in general use have one  very serious fault, the water is discharged into the lower part of the  rectum, which is distended, and thus produces an irritation which often  proves injurious, causing and aggravating piles and other rectal  troubles. It in frequently a cause of constipation and creates a  necessity for continuing the use of enemas indefinitely.    Dr. Wright's New Colon Syringe    Consists of a strong, well made, four quart rubber bag or reservoir with  two long SOFT RUBBER FLEXIBLE TUBES, by the use of which the water is  easily carried past the rectum and into the sigmoid flexure, and by the  use of the longest tube may be carried up to the transverse colon. The  water is then discharged where it needed and the cleansing is made much  more perfect than it can be in any other way. The tubing and the outlets  are extra large, securing a rapid discharge of the water, which reduces  the time required to less than one-half that usually taken, which is a  very great advantage over other syringes. This new syringe will prove a  most important help in the taking of \"Internal Baths\" in the \"New  Method\" treatment as recommended by Dr. Forest and others, and will  prove curative in many cases when all others fail.    Dr. Wright's manual on the taking of the \"Internal Bath,\" containing  full directions for its use in Constipation, Diarrhoea, Dyspepsia,  Biliousness, Sick Headache, Kidney Troubles, Convulsions, Jaundice,  Rheumatism, Colds, Influenza, La Grippe, Diseases of Women, Worms and  Constipation in Children and other diseases, price 25c., is given free  with each syringe.    Carefully packed in a fine polished wooden case, will be sent prepaid to  any address on receipt of price, $5.00, with a copy of Dr. Forest's  great work, \"The New Method,\" the very best work on Health and Disease  published. (Price, $1.00), both for $5.50.    An Infants' Flexible Rubber Tube will be sent for 75c. extra; New  improved Vaginal Irrigator, $1.00; two Hard Rubber Rectal Tubes if  desired, 25c extra. Agents wanted to introduce and sell this.          Health Culture Appliances      =DR. WRIGHT'S COLON SYRINGE=, for taking the New Internal Bath.    This consists of a one-gallon reservoir, one each, long and short  flexible rubber colon tube, one box of antiseptic powder, and Dr.  Wright's Manual of the New Internal Bath, all packed in a polished  wooden case. Price, prepaid, $5.00.    =THE PRIMO LADIES' SYRINGE=. Price, $2.00. The only properly constructed  Vaginal Syringe made.    Every woman should have a good syringe for use in emergencies and for  purposes of cleanliness, which is essential to health, comfort and  pleasure.    All women, married or single, should have a Primo. With each is sent  full directions for use in all emergencies.    =DR. FOREST'S MASSAGE ROLLERS.=    These rollers are coming into general use wherever massage is needed and  are a cure for many of the functional disorders as Dyspepsia,  Constipation, Biliousness, Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Sleeplessness,  Obesity, and wherever there is a lack of a good circulation of the  blood; and the developers and facial rollers are used successfully for  building up the form and the prevention of wrinkles and age in the face.  The rollers consist of wheels about 1-1/2 inches in diameter: around the  centre is a band or buffer of elastic rubber.    =No. 1, Body Roller, 6 Wheels, $2.=--The best size for use over body, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#19)"],[1,"was occupied by the  shrine of St. Thomas. The principal altar to the Virgin in our cathedral  was that in the crypt, in the \"Chapel of Our Lady Undercroft.\" The  vault of the Dean's Chapel is noticeable. It is a fan vault, of the style  developed to so great perfection in the Tudor period, as shown in Henry  VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, and in the roof of the staircase leading to  the dining-hall of Christ Church, Oxford. The architecture of this chapel  is Perpendicular in style, and its delicate decoration should be carefully  noticed; the screen which separates it from the Martyrdom Transept is also  worthy of close attention. The monuments here are interesting rather than  beautiful. Dean Fotherby is commemorated by a hideous erection bristling  with skulls. Dean Boys is represented as he died, sitting among his books  in his library; it is curious that the books are all apparently turned  with the backs of the covers towards the wall, and the edges of the leaves  outwards. Here also is the monument of Dean Turner, the faithful follower  of Charles I.    [Illustration: PART OF SOUTH-WESTERN TRANSEPT.]    #The South-West Transept.#--Crossing the cathedral through the passage  under the choir steps, we find ourselves in the south-west transept,  which, together with the nave and the north-west transept, was rebuilt  by Prior Chillenden. In the pavement we see memorial stones to canons  and other departed worthies. Among them is the tombstone of Meric Casaubon,  Archbishop Laud's prebendary, and son of Isaac Casaubon, the famous  scholar.    #St. Michael's, or the Warrior's Chapel.#--Eastward of the south-west  transept is a small chapel, generally known as that of St. Michael. In  position and size it closely corresponds with the Dean's Chapel on the  north side of the church. In general style there is also some resemblance,  but the vaulting of the roof is quite different; it is described by  Professor Willis as \"as a complex lierne vault of an unusual pattern, but  resembling that of the north transept of Gloucester Cathedral, which dates  from 1367 to 1372.\" The exact date and the name of the builder of this  chapel are alike uncertain, but it probably replaced the old Chapel of St.  Michael at some time towards the end of the fourteenth century, and Willis  comes to the conclusion that it is most probable that its erection may be  ascribed to Prior Chillenden, and that \"it formed part of the general  scheme for the transformation of the western part of the church.\"    A curious effect is presented by the tomb of Stephen Langton, who was  archbishop from 1207 to 1228, and is famous as having compelled King John  to sign the Great Charter, and also as having divided the Bible into  chapters. His tomb, shaped like a stone coffin, is half in the chapel and  half under the eastern wall, and Professor Willis considers that it was  originally outside the wall, in the churchyard; \"and thus the new wall,  when the chapel was rebuilt and enlarged in the fourteenth century, was  made to stride over the coffin by means of an arch.\" The reverence in  which Langton's memory was held is attested by the fact that his remains  must have lain under the altar of the chapel, a most unusual position  except in the case of celebrated saints. In the middle of the chapel is a  very beautiful and interesting monument erected by Margaret Holland, who  died in 1437, to the memory of her two husbands and herself. The monument  is of alabaster and marble, and represents the lady reposing with her  first spouse, John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset, and son of John of Gaunt,  on her left, and Thomas, Duke of Clarence, her second husband, on her  right. The latter was the second son of Henry IV., and, so, nephew of John  of Somerset the first husband; he was killed at the battle of Bauge in  1421. Leland thinks that this chapel was built expressly for the reception  of this tomb: \"This chapel be likelihood was made new for the Honor of  Erle John of Somerset,\" but it is probably of rather earlier date than  would be allowed by this theory. The figures of Margaret and her two lords  are very fine and are interesting examples of fifteenth century costume.  As such they may be contrasted with the effigy of Lady Thornhurst, who  exhibits all the beauty of an Elizabethan ruff. Sir Thomas Thornhurst,  whose monument is hard by, was killed in the ill-fated expedition to the  Isle of Rhe. In the corner of the chapel is the bust of Sir George Rooke,  Vice-Admiral, who led the assault on Gibraltar by which it was first  captured. And the title of \"Warrior's\" Chapel is further justified by the  presence here of tattered standards, memorials of dead comrades, left by  the famous Kentish regiment, \"the Buffs.\"    [Illustration: THE CRYPT.]    #The Main Crypt.#--Returning through the passage under the steps that lead  up to the choir, we turn to the right into the crypt which originally  supported Conrad's \"glorious choir.\" On the wall as we enter we may notice  some diaper-work ornamentation, interesting from the fact that a similar  decoration may be traced on the wall of the chapter house at Rochester  for Ernulf who built the westward crypt, was afterwards made Bishop of  Rochester. Willis tells us that there are five crypts in England under the  eastern parts of cathedrals, namely, at Canterbury, Winchester,  Gloucester, Rochester, and Worcester, and that they were all founded  before 1085. \"After this they were discontinued except as a continuation  of former ones, as in Canterbury and Rochester.\" This crypt of Ernulf's  replaced the earlier one set up by Lanfranc; Willis thinks it not  impossible that the whole of the pier-shafts may have been taken from the  earlier crypt. \"The capitals of the columns are either plain blocks or  sculptured with Norman enrichments. Some of them, however, are in an  unfinished state.\" He describes minutely one of the capitals on the  south-west side. \"Of the four sides of the block two are quite plain. One  has the ornament roughed out, or \"bosted\" as the workmen call it, that is,  the pattern has been traced upon the block, and the spaces between the  figures roughly sunk down with square edges preparatory to the completion.  On the fourth side, the pattern is quite finished. This proves that the  carving was executed after the stones were set in their places, and  probably the whole of these capitals would eventually have been so  ornamented had not the fire and its results brought in a new school  of carving in the rich foliated capitals, which caused this merely  superficial method of decoration to be neglected and abandoned. In the  same way some of the shafts are roughly fluted in various fashions. The  plain ones would probably have all gradually had the same ornament given  to them, had not the same reasons interfered.\" The crypt then stands as  it was left by Ernulf except that some of the piers were afterwards  strengthened and one new pillar was inserted in the aisle by William of  Sens, in order to fit in with the new arrangement of the pillars in the  choir which he was then rebuilding. It is therefore, of course, the oldest  part of the church, and remains a most beautiful and interesting relic of  Norman work in spite of the hot water pipe apparatus which now disfigures  it, and its general air of unkempt untidiness. There are signs, however,  that in this respect there is likely to be some improvement. The floor is  being lowered to its original level by the removal of about a foot of  accumulated dirt which had been heaping itself up for the last eight  hundred years and had at last entirely smothered the bases of the columns,  and it is even whispered that the part now cut off and used as the French  church, may be opened out and restored to its original position as part of  the main crypt.    According to Gervase, the whole of the crypt was dedicated to the Virgin  Mary. Here stood the Chapel of Our Lady Undercroft, surrounded by  Perpendicular stone-work screens, from which the altar-screen in the choir  above was imitated. The shrine of the Virgin was exceedingly rich and was  only shown to privileged worshippers: traces of decoration may still be  seen in the vault above. It was at the back of this shrine that Becket  was laid between the time of his murder and his translation to the  resting-place in the Trinity Chapel.    In the main crypt we may notice the monument of Isabel, Countess of Athol,  who died in 1292; she was heiress of Chilham Castle, near Canterbury, and  grand-daughter of King John. She was twice married, her second husband  being Alexander, brother of John Baliol, King of Scotland. The monument  of Lady Mohun of Dunster is in the south screen of the Chapel of Our Lady.  She was ancestress of the present Earl of Derby, and founded a perpetual  chantry. Lastly, here is the tomb of Cardinal Archbishop Morton, the  friend of Sir Thomas More, and the faithful servant of the House of  Lancaster; it was he who brought about the union of the Red and White  Roses by arranging the marriage of Henry of Richmond with Elizabeth of  York. As Henry VII.'s Chancellor he made great exactions under the  euphonious title of \"Benevolences,\" and propounded the famous dilemma  known as \"Morton's Fork,\" by which he argued that those who lived lavishly  must obviously have something to spare for the king's service, while those  who fared soberly must be grown rich on their savings, and so were equally  fair game to the royal plunderer. He lies in the south-west corner of the  crypt, and his monument, which has suffered considerably at the hands of  the Puritans, bears the Tudor portcullis and the archbishop's rebus, a  hawk or _mort_ standing on a tun.    [Illustration: ST. GABRIEL'S CHAPEL.]    In the south-east corner, under Anselm's Tower, is a chapel generally  known as that of St. John, sometimes as that of St. Gabriel. It has been  divided into two compartments by a wall. There "]]]
