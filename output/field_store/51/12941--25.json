The Ladakhis are  Buddhists.    ~Religions in Panjab.~--The distribution by religions of the population of  the Panjab and its native States in 1911 was:      Muhammadans                       12,275,477 or 51 p.c.    Hindus                             8,773,621 or 36 p.c.    Sikhs                              2,883,729 or 12 p.c.    Others, chiefly Christian (199,751)  254,923 or  1 p.c.    [Illustration: Fig. 36. Map showing distribution of religions.]    The strength of the Muhammadans is in the districts west of the Bias and  the Sutlej below its junction with the Bias. 83 p.c. of the subjects of  the Nawab of Bahawalpur are also Muhammadans. In all this western region  there are few Hindus apart from the shopkeepers and traders. On the  other hand the hill country in the north-east is purely Hindu, except on  the borders of Tibet, where the scanty population professes Buddhism.  While Hinduism is the predominant faith in the south-east, quite a  fourth of the people there are Musalmans. Sikhs nowhere form a majority.  The districts in the eastern part of the Central Plains where they  constitute more than one-fifth of the population are indicated in the  map. In six districts, Lahore, Montgomery, Gujranwala, Lyallpur,  Hoshyarpur, and Ambala the proportion is between 10 and 20 p.c.    [Illustration: Fig. 37. Raghunath Temple, Jammu.]    ~Growth and Decline in numbers.~--There was a slight rise in the number of  Muhammadans between 1901 and 1911. Their losses in the central  districts, where the plague scourge has been heaviest, were  counterbalanced by gains in the western tract, where its effect has been  slight. On the other hand the decrease under Hindus amounts to nearly  15 p.c. The birth-rate is lower and the death-rate higher among Hindus  than among Musalmans, and their losses by plague in the central and some  of the south-eastern districts have been very heavy. A change of  sentiment on the part of the Sikh community has led to many persons  recording themselves as Sikhs who were formerly content to be regarded  as Hindus. It must be remembered that one out of four of the recorded  Hindus belongs to impure castes, who even in the Panjab pollute food and  water by their touch and are excluded from the larger temples. Since  1901 a considerable number of Chuhras or Sweepers have been converted to  Islam and Christianity.    [Illustration: Fig. 38. Golden Temple, Amritsar.]    ~Sikhs.~--Notwithstanding heavy losses by plague Sikhs have increased by  37 p.c. A great access of zeal has led to many more Sikhs becoming  _Kesdharis_. _Sajhdharis_ or _Munas_, who form over one-fifth of the  whole Sikh community, were in 1901 classed as Hindus. They are followers  of Baba Nanak, cut their hair, and often smoke. When a man has taken the  \"_pahul_,\" which is the sign of his becoming a _Kesdhari_ or follower of  Guru Govind, he must give up the _hukka_ and leave his hair unshorn. The  future of Sikhism is with the _Kesdharis_.    [Illustration: Fig. 39. Mosque in Lahore City.]    ~Muhammadans.~--In the eastern districts the conversions to Islam were  political, and Hindu and Muhammadan Rajputs live peaceably together in  the same village. The Musalmans have their mosque for the worship of  Allah, but were, and are still, not quite sure that it is prudent wholly  to neglect the godlings. The conversion of the western Panjab was the  result largely of missionary effort. _Piri muridi_ is a great  institution there. Every man should be the \"_murid_\" or pupil of some  holy man or _pir_, who combines the functions in the Roman Catholic  Church of spiritual director in this world and the saint in heaven. The  _pir_ may be the custodian of some little saint's tomb in a village, or  of some great shrine like that of Baba Farid at Pakpattan, or Bahawal  Hakk at Multan, or Taunsa Sharif in Dera Ghazi Khan, or Golra in  Rawalpindi. His own holiness may be more official than personal. About  1400 A.D. the Kashmiris were offered by their Sultan Sikandar the choice  between conversion and exile, and chose the easier alternative. Like the  western Panjabis they are above all things saint-worshippers. The  ejaculations used to stimulate effort show this. The embankment builder  in the south-western Panjab invokes the holy breath of Bahawal Hakk, and  the Kashmiri boatman's cry \"Ya Pir, dast gir,\" \"Oh Saint, lend me a  hand,\" is an appeal to their national saint.    ~Effect of Education.~--The Musalmans of the western Panjab have a great  dislike to Sikhs, dating from the period of the political predominance  of the latter. So far the result of education has been to accentuate  religious differences and animosities. Both Sikhs and Musalmans are  gradually dropping ideas and observances retained in their daily life  after they ceased to call themselves Hindus. On the other hand, within  the Hindu fold laxity is now the rule rather than the exception, and the  neglect of the old ritual and restrictions is by no means confined to  the small but influential reforming minority which calls itself Arya  Samaj.    ~Christians.~--The number of Christians increased threefold between 1901  and 1911. The Presbyterian missionaries have been especially successful  in attracting large numbers of outcastes into the Christian Church.    [Illustration: Fig. 40. God and Goddess, Chamba.]    ~Hinduism in the Panjab.~--Hinduism has always been, and to-day is more  than ever, a very elastic term. The Census Superintendent, himself a  high caste Hindu, wrote: \"The definition which would cover the Hindu of  the modern times is that he should be born of parents not belonging to  some recognised religion other than Hinduism, marry within the same  limits, believe in God, respect the cow, and cremate the dead.\" There is  room in its ample folds for the Arya Samajist, who rejects idol worship  and is divesting himself of caste prejudices and marriage restrictions,  and the most orthodox Sanatan dharmist, who carries out the whole  elaborate daily ritual of the Brahmanical religion, and submits to all  its complicated rules; for the ordinary Hindu trader, who is equally  orthodox by profession, but whose ordinary religious exercises are  confined to bathing in the morning; for the villager of the eastern  districts, who often has the name of Parameshvar or the Supreme Lord on  his lips, but who really worships the godlings, Guga Pir, Sarwar or  Sultan Pir, Sitla (the small-pox goddess), and others, whose little  shrines we see round the village site; and for the childish idolaters of  Kulu, who carry their local deities about to visit each other at fairs,  and would see nothing absurd in locking them all up in a dungeon if rain  held off too long.    [Illustration: Fig. 41. A Kulu godling and his attendants.]          CHAPTER XI    THE PEOPLE (_continued_): EDUCATION      ~Educational progress.~--According to the census returns of 1911 there are  not four persons per 100 in the province who are \"literate\" in the sense  of being able to read and write a letter. The proportion of literacy  among Hindus and Sikhs is three times as great as among Muhammadans. In  1911-12 one boy in six of school-going age was at school or college and  one girl in 37. This may seem a meagre result of sixty years of work,  for the Government and Christian missionaries, who have had an  honourable connection with the educational history of the province,  began their efforts soon after annexation, and a Director of Public  Instruction was appointed as long ago as 1856. But a country of small  peasant farmers is not a very hopeful educational field, and the rural  population was for long indifferent or hostile. If an ex-soldier of the  _Khalsa_ had expressed his feelings, he would have used words like those  of the \"Old Pindari\" in Lyall's poem, while the Muhammadan farmer, had  he been capable of expressing his hostility, might have argued that the  teaching his son could get in a village school would help him not at all  in his daily work. Things are better now. We have improved our scheme of  teaching, and of late raised the pay of the teachers, which is, however,  still hardly adequate. Till a better class of teachers can be secured  for primary schools, the best educational theories will not bear fruit  in practice. The old indifference is weakening, and the most hopeful  sign is the increasing interest taken in towns in female education, a  matter of the first importance for the future of the country.    ~Present position.~--The present position is as follows:--The Government  has made itself directly or indirectly responsible for the education of  the province. At the headquarters of each district there is a high  school for boys controlled by the Education Department. In each district  there are Government middle schools, Anglo-vernacular or Vernacular,  and primary schools, managed by the Municipal Committees and District  Boards. Each middle school has a primary, and each high school a primary  and a middle, department. For the convenience of pupils who cannot  attend school while living at home hostels are attached to many middle  and high schools. Fees are very moderate. In middle schools, where the  income covers 56 p.c. of the expenditure, they range from R. 1 (16  pence) monthly in the lowest class in which they are levied to Rs. 4 (5  shillings) in the highest class. In rural primary schools the children  of agriculturists are exempt because they pay local rate, and others,  when not exempt on the score of poverty, pay nominal fees. Besides the  Government schools there are aided schools of the above classes usually  of a sectarian character, and these, if they satisfy the standards laid  down, receive grants. There is a decreasing, but still considerable,  class of private schools, which make no attempt to satisfy the  conditions attached to these grants. The _mullah_ in the mosque teaches  children passages of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#19)"],[1,"winter. If they are small, they cannot be made powerful,  even by the most generous feeding. There are too few bees to build comb,  and take care of the eggs which a healthy queen can lay; and when fed,  they are apt to fill with honey, the cells in which young bees ought to  be raised; thus making the kindness of their owner serve only to hasten  their destruction. My hives enable me to supply all such swarms at once  with combs containing bee-bread, honey and brood almost mature. They are  thus made strong, and flourish as well, nay, often better than the first  swarms which have an old queen, whose fertility is generally not so  great as that of a young one.    40. It should enable the Apiarian to multiply his colonies with a  certainty and rapidity which are entirely out of the question, if he  depends upon natural swarming. (See Chapter on Artificial Swarming.)    41. It should enable the Apiarian to supply destitute colonies with the  means of obtaining a new queen.    Every Apiarian would find it, for this reason, if for no other, to his  advantage to possess, at least, one such hive. (See Chapters on  Physiology, and loss of Queen.)    42. It should enable him to catch the queen, for any purpose; especially  to remove an old one whose fertility is impaired by age, that her place  may be supplied with a young one. (See Chapter on Artificial Swarming.)    43. While a good hive is adapted to the wants of those who desire to  enter upon bee-keeping on a large scale, or at least to manage their  colonies on the most improved plans, it ought to be suited to the wants  of those who are too timid, too ignorant, or for any reason indisposed,  to manage them in any other than the common way.    44. It should enable a single individual to superintend the colonies of  many different persons.    Many would like to keep bees, if they could have them taken care of, by  those who would undertake their management, just as a gardener does the  gardens and grounds of his employers. No person can agree to do this  with the common hives. If the bees are allowed to swarm, he may be  called in a dozen different directions, and if any accident, such as the  loss of a queen, happens to the colonies of his customers, he can apply  no remedy. If the bees are in non-swarming hives, he cannot multiply the  stocks when this is desired.    On my plan, gentlemen who desire it, may have the pleasure of witnessing  the industry and sagacity of this wonderful insect, and of gratifying  their palates with its delicious stores, harvested on their own  premises, without incurring either trouble or risk of injury.    45. All the joints of the hive should be water-tight, and there should  be no doors or slides which are liable to shrink, swell, or get out of  order.    The importance of this will be sufficiently obvious to any one who has  had the ordinary share of vexatious experience in the use of such  fixtures.    46. It should enable the bee-keeper entirely to dispense with sheds, and  costly Apiaries; as each hive when properly placed, should alike defy,  heat or cold, rain or snow. (See Chapter on Protection.)    47. It should allow the contents of a hive, bees, combs and all, to be  taken out; so that any necessary repairs may be made.    This may be done, with my hives, in a few minutes. \"A stitch in time  saves nine.\" Hives which can be thoroughly overhauled and repaired, from  time to time, if properly attended to, will last for generations.    48. The hive and fixtures should present a neat and attractive  appearance, and should admit, when desired, of being made highly  ornamental.    49. The hives ought not to be liable to be blown down in high winds.    My hives, being very low in proportion to their other dimensions, it  would require almost a hurricane to upset them.    50. It should enable an Apiarian who lives in the neighborhood of human  pilferers, to lock up the precious contents of his hives, in some cheap,  simple and convenient way.    A couple of padlocks with some cheap fixtures, will suffice to secure a  long range of hives.    51. A good hive should be protected against the destructive ravages of  mice in winter.    It seems almost incredible that so puny an animal should dare to invade  a hive of bees; and yet not unfrequently they slip in when the bees are  compelled by the cold to retreat from the entrance. Having once found  admission, they build themselves a nest in their comfortable abode, eat  up the honey, and such bees as are too much chilled to make any  resistance; and fill the premises with such an abominable stench, that  on the approach of warm weather, the bees often in a body abandon their  desecrated home. As soon as the cold weather approaches, all my hives  may have their entrances either entirely closed, or so contracted that  a mouse cannot gain admission.    52. A good hive should have its alighting board constructed so as to  shelter the bees against wind and wet, and thus to facilitate to the  utmost their entrance when they come home with their heavy burdens.    If this precaution is neglected, much valuable time and many lives will  be sacrificed, as the colony cannot be encouraged to use to the best  advantage the unpromising days which so often occur in the working  season.    I have succeeded in arranging my alighting board in such a manner that  the bees are sheltered against wind and wet, and are able to enter the  hive with the least possible loss of time.    53. A well constructed hive ought to admit of being shut up in winter,  so as to consign the bees to darkness and repose.    Nothing can be more hazardous than to shut up closely an ill protected  hive. Even if the bees have an abundance of air, it will not answer to  prevent them from flying out, if they are so disposed. As soon as the  warmth penetrating their thin hives tempts them to fly, they crowd to  the entrance, and if it is shut, multitudes worry themselves to death in  trying to get out, and the whole colony is liable to become diseased.    In my hives as soon as the bees are shut up for Winter, they are most  effectually protected against all atmospheric changes, and never  _desire_ to leave their hives until the entrances are again opened, on  the return of suitable weather. Thus they pass the Winter in a state of  almost absolute repose; they eat much less honey[12] than when wintered  on the ordinary plan; a much smaller number die in the hives; none are  lost upon the snow, and they are more healthy, and commence breeding  much earlier than they do in the common hives. As some of the holes into  the Protector are left open in Winter, any bee that is diseased and  wishes to leave the hive can do so. Bees when diseased have a strange  propensity to leave their hives, just as animals when sick seek to  retreat from their companions; and in Summer such bees may often be seen  forsaking their home to perish on the ground. If all egress from the  hive in Winter is prevented, the diseased bees will not be able to  comply with an instinct which urges them \"To leave their country for  their country's good.\"    54. It should possess all these requisites without being too costly for  common bee-keepers, or too complicated to be constructed by any one who  can handle simple tools: and they should be so combined that the result  is a simple hive, which any one can manage who has ordinary intelligence  on the subject of bees.    I suppose that the very natural conclusion from reading this long list  of desirables, would be that no single hive can combine them all,  without being exceedingly complicated and expensive. On the contrary,  the simplicity and cheapness with which my hive secures all these  results, is one of its most striking peculiarities, the attainment of  which has cost me more study than all the other points besides. As far  as the bees are concerned, they can work in this hive with even greater  facility than in the simple old-fashioned box, as the frames are left  rough by the saw, and thus give an admirable support to the bees when  building their combs; and they can enter the spare honey boxes, with  even more ease than if they were merely continuations of the main hive.    There are a few desirables to which my hive makes not the slightest  pretensions! It promises no splendid results to those who purchase it,  and yet are too ignorant, or too careless to be entrusted with the  management of bees. In bee-keeping, as in other things, a man must first  understand his business, and then proceed on the good old maxim, that  \"the hand of the diligent maketh rich.\"    It possesses no talismanic influence by which it can convert a bad  situation for honey, into a good one; or give the Apiarian an abundant  harvest whether the season is productive or otherwise.    It cannot enable the cultivator rapidly to multiply his stocks, and yet  to secure, the same season, surplus honey from his bees. As well might  the breeder of poultry pretend that he can, in the same year, both raise  the greatest number of chickens, and sell the largest number of eggs.    Worse than all, it cannot furnish the many advantages enumerated, and  yet be made in as little time, or quite as cheap as a hive which proves,  in the end, to be a very dear bargain.    I have not constructed my hive in accordance with crude theories, or  mere conjectures, and then insisted that the bees must flourish in such  a fanciful contrivance; but I have studied, for many years, most  carefully, the nature of the honey-bee; and have diligently compared my  observations with those of writers and practical cultivators, who have  spent their lives in extending the sphere of Apiarian knowledge; and as  the result, have endeavored to adapt my hive to the actual wants and  habits of the bee; and to remedy the many difficulties with which I have  found its successful culture to be beset. And more than this, I have  actually tested by experiments long"]]]
