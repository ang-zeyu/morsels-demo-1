Supper was a delight.  Johnny had killed four mountain-sheep and a caribou while we were gone,  and not only had fed the dogs well, but from time to time had put aside  choice portions expecting our return. But what was most grateful to us  and most extraordinary in him, the boy had saved, untouched, the small  ration of sugar and milk left for his consumption, knowing that ours was  all destroyed; and we enjoyed coffee with these luxurious appurtenances  as only they can who have been long deprived of them. There are not many  boys of fifteen or sixteen of any race who would voluntarily have done  the like.    [Illustration: Johnny Fred who kept the base camp and fed the dogs and  would not touch the sugar.]    The next day there was much to do. There were pack-saddles of canvas to  make for the dogs' backs that they might help us carry our necessary  stuff out; our own clothing and footwear to overhaul, bread to bake,  guns to clean and oil against rust. Yet withal, we took it lazily, with  five to divide these tasks, and napped and lay around and continually  consumed biscuits and coffee which Johnny continually cooked. We all  took at least a partial bath in the creek, cold as it was, the first  bath in--well, in a long time. Mountain climbers belong legitimately to  the great unwashed.    It was a day of perfect rest and contentment with hearts full of  gratitude. Not a single mishap had occurred to mar the complete success  of our undertaking--not an injury of any sort to any one, nor an  illness. All five of us were in perfect health. Surely we had reason to  be grateful; and surely we were happy in having Him to whom our  gratitude might be poured out. What a bald, incomplete, and  disconcerting thing it must be to have no one to thank for crowning  mercies like these!    On Tuesday, the 10th June, we made our final abandonment, leaving the  tent standing with stove and food and many articles that we did not need  cached in it, and with four of the dogs carrying packs and led with  chains, packs on our own backs and the ice-axes for staves in our hands,  we turned our backs upon the mountain and went down the valley toward  the Clearwater. The going was not too bad until we had crossed that  stream and climbed the hills to the rolling country between it and the  McKinley Fork of the Kantishna. Again and again we looked back for a  parting glimpse of the mountain, but we never saw sign of it any more.  The foot-hills were clear, the rugged wall of the glacier cut the sky,  but the great mountain might have been a thousand miles off for any  visible indication it gave. It is easy to understand how travellers  across equatorial Africa have passed near the base of the snowy peaks of  Ruwenzori without knowing they were even in the neighborhood of great  mountains, and have come back and denied their existence.    [Sidenote: Across Country]    The broken country between the streams was difficult. Underneath was a  thick elastic moss in which the foot sank three or four inches at every  step and that makes toilsome travelling. The mosquitoes were a constant  annoyance. But the abundant bird life upon this open moorland,  continually reminding one as it did of moorlands in the north of England  or of Scotland, was full of interest. Ptarmigan, half changed from their  snowy plumage to the brown of summer, and presenting a curious piebald  appearance, were there in great numbers, cackling their guttural cry  with its concluding notes closely resembling the \"ko-ax, ko-ax\" of the  Frogs' Chorus in the comedy of Aristophanes; snipe whistled and curlews  whirled all about us. Half-way across to the McKinley Fork it began to  rain, thunder-peal succeeding thunder-peal, and each crash announcing a  heavier downpour. Soon we were all wet through, and then the rain turned  to hail that fell smartly until all the moss was white with it, and that  gave place to torrents of rain again. Dog packs and men's packs were  alike wet, and no one of us had a dry stitch on him when we reached the  banks of the McKinley Fork and the old spacious hunting tent that stands  there in which we were to spend the night. Rather hopelessly we hung our  bedding to dry on ropes strung about some trees, and our wet clothing  around the stove. By taking turns all the night in sitting up, to keep a  fire going, we managed to get our clothes dried by morning, but the  bedding was wet as ever. Fortunately, the night was a warm one.    [Sidenote: Glacial Streams]    The next morning there was the McKinley Fork to cross the first thing,  and it was a difficult and disagreeable task. This stream, which drains  the Muldrow Glacier and therefore the whole northeast face of Denali,  occupies a dreary, desolate bed of boulder and gravel and mud a mile or  more wide; rather it does not occupy it, save perhaps after tremendous  rain following great heat, but wanders amid it, with a dozen channels of  varying depth but uniform blackness, the inky solution of the shale  which the mountain discharges so abundantly tingeing not only its waters  but the whole Kantishna, into which it flows one hundred miles away.  Commonly in the early morning the waters are low, the night frosts  checking the melting of the glacier ice; but this morning the drainage  of yesterday's rain-storm had swollen them. Channel after channel was  waded in safety until the main stream was reached, and that swept by,  thigh-deep, with a rushing black current that had a very evil look.  Karstens was scouting ahead, feeling for the shallower places, stemming  the hurrying waters till they swept up to his waist. The dogs did not  like the look of it and with their packs, still wet from yesterday, were  hampered in swimming. Two that Tatum was leading suddenly turned back  when half-way across, and the chains, entangling his legs, pulled him  over face foremost into the deepest of the water. His pack impeded his  efforts to rise, and the water swept all over him. Karstens hurried back  to his rescue, and he was extricated from his predicament, half drowned  and his clothes filled with mud and sand. There was no real danger of  drowning, but it was a particularly noxious ducking in icy filth. The  sun was warm, however, and after basking upon the rocks awhile he was  able to proceed, still wet, though he had stripped and wrung out his  clothes--for we had no dry change--and very gritty in underwear, but  taking no harm whatever. I think Tatum regretted losing, in the mad rush  of black water, the ice-axe he had carried to the top of the mountain  more than he regretted his wetting.    [Sidenote: Birds and Beasts]    On the further bank of the McKinley Fork we entered our first wood, a  belt about three miles wide that lines the river. Our first forest trees  gave us almost as much pleasure as our first flowers. Animal life  abounded, all in the especially interesting condition of rearing  half-grown young. Squirrels from their nests scolded at our intrusion  most vehemently; an owl flew up with such a noisy snapping and  chattering that our attention was drawn to the point from which she  rose, and there, perched upon a couple of rotten stumps a few feet  apart, were two half-fledged owlets, passive, immovable, which allowed  themselves to be photographed and even handled without any indication of  life except in their wondering eyes and the circumrotary heads that  contained them. Moose signs and bear signs were everywhere; rabbits, now  in their summer livery, flitted from bush to bush. That belt of wood was  a zoological garden stocked with birds and mammals. And we rejoiced with  them over their promising families and harmed none.    From the wood we rose again to the moorland--to the snipe and ptarmigan  and curlews, some yet sitting upon belated eggs--to the heavy going of  the moss and the yet heavier going of niggerhead. Our journey skirted a  large lake picturesquely surrounded by hills, and we spoke of how  pleasantly a summer lodge might be placed upon its shores were it not  for the mosquitoes. The incessant leaping of fish, the occasional flight  of fowl alone disturbed the perfect reflection of cliff and hill in its  waters. At times we followed game trails along its margin; at times  swampy ground made us seek the hillside.    Thus, slowly covering the miles that we had gone so quickly over upon  the ice of the lake two months before, we reached Moose Creek and the  miners' cabins at Eureka late at night and received warm welcome and  most hospitable entertainment from Mr. Jack Hamilton. It was good to see  men other than our own party again, good to sleep in a bed once more,  good to regale ourselves with food long strange to our mouths. Here we  had our first intimation of any happenings in the outside world for the  past three months and sorrowed that Saint Sophia was still to remain a  Mohammedan temple, and that the kindly King of Greece had been murdered.  Here also Hamilton generously provided us with spare mosquito-netting  for veils, and we found a package of canvas gloves I had ordered from  Fairbanks long before, and so were protected from our chief enemies.  From Moose Creek we went over the hills to Caribou Creek and again were  most kindly welcomed and entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Quigley, and  discussed our climb for a long while with McGonogill of the \"pioneer\"  party. Then, mainly down the bed of Glacier Creek, now on lingering ice  or snow-drift, with the water rushing underneath, now on the rocks, now  through the brush, crossing and recrossing the creek, we reached the  long line of desolate, decaying houses known as Glacier City, and found  convenient refuge in one of the cabins therein, still maintained as an  occasional abode. On the outskirts of the \"city\" next morning a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#19)"],[1,"days before the Groome Street gang  began to be.    Shamrock Hall, being under the eyes of the great Bat, was, of  course, forbidden ground; and it was with no intention of spoiling  the harmony of the evening that Mr. Dawson had looked in. He was  there in a purely private and peaceful character.    As he sat smoking, sipping, and observing the revels, there settled  at the next table Mr. Robert (\"Nigger\") Coston, an eminent member  of the Three Points.    There being temporary peace between the two gangs, the great men  exchanged a not unfriendly nod and, after a short pause, a word or  two. Mr. Coston, alluding to an Italian who had just pirouetted  past, remarked that there sure was some class to the way that wop  hit it up. Mr. Dawson said Yup, there sure was. You would have said  that all Nature smiled.    Alas! The next moment the sky was covered with black clouds and the  storm broke. For Mr. Dawson, continuing in this vein of criticism,  rather injudiciously gave it as his opinion that one of the lady  dancers had two left feet.    For a moment Mr. Coston did not see which lady was alluded to.    \"De goil in de pink skoit,\" said Mr. Dawson, facilitating the  other's search by pointing with a much-chewed cigarette. It was at  this moment that Nature's smile was shut off as if by a tap. For  the lady in the pink skirt had been in receipt of Mr. Coston's  respectful devotion for the past eight days.    From this point onwards the march of events was rapid.    Mr. Coston, rising, asked Mr. Dawson who he thought he, Mr. Dawson,  was.    Mr. Dawson, extinguishing his cigarette and placing it behind his  ear, replied that he was the fellow who could bite his, Mr.  Coston's, head off.    Mr. Coston said: \"Huh?\"    Mr. Dawson said: \"Sure.\"    Mr. Coston called Mr. Dawson a pie-faced rubber-necked  four-flusher.    Mr. Dawson called Mr. Coston a coon.    And that was where the trouble really started.    It was secretly a great grief to Mr. Coston that his skin was of so  swarthy a hue. To be permitted to address Mr. Coston face to face  by his nickname was a sign of the closest friendship, to which only  Spider Reilly, Jack Repetto, and one or two more of the gang could  aspire. Others spoke of him as Nigger, or, more briefly,  Nig--strictly behind his back. For Mr. Coston had a wide reputation  as a fighter, and his particular mode of battling was to descend on  his antagonist and bite him. Into this action he flung himself with  the passionate abandonment of the artist. When he bit he bit. He  did not nibble.    If a friend had called Mr. Coston \"Nig\" he would have been running  grave risks. A stranger, and a leader of a rival gang, who  addressed him as \"coon\" was more than asking for trouble. He was  pleading for it.    Great men seldom waste time. Mr. Coston, leaning towards Mr.  Dawson, promptly bit him on the cheek. Mr. Dawson bounded from his  seat. Such was the excitement of the moment that, instead of  drawing his \"canister,\" he forgot that he had one on his person,  and, seizing a mug which had held beer, bounced it vigorously on  Mr. Coston's skull, which, being of solid wood, merely gave out a  resonant note and remained unbroken.    So far the honours were comparatively even, with perhaps a slight  balance in favour of Mr. Coston. But now occurred an incident  which turned the scale, and made war between the gangs inevitable.  In the far corner of the room, surrounded by a crowd of admiring  friends, sat Spider Reilly, monarch of the Three Points. He had  noticed that there was a slight disturbance at the other side of  the hall, but had given it little attention till, the dancing  ceasing suddenly and the floor emptying itself of its crowd, he had  a plain view of Mr. Dawson and Mr. Coston squaring up at each  other for the second round. We must assume that Mr. Reilly was not  thinking what he did, for his action was contrary to all rules of  gang-etiquette. In the street it would have been perfectly  legitimate, even praiseworthy, but in a dance-hall belonging to a  neutral power it was unpardonable.    What he did was to produce his \"canister\" and pick off the  unsuspecting Mr. Dawson just as that exquisite was preparing to get  in some more good work with the beer-mug. The leader of the Table  Hillites fell with a crash, shot through the leg; and Spider  Reilly, together with Mr. Coston and others of the Three Points,  sped through the doorway for safety, fearing the wrath of Bat  Jarvis, who, it was known, would countenance no such episodes at  the dance-hall which he had undertaken to protect.    Mr. Dawson, meanwhile, was attended to and helped home. Willing  informants gave him the name of his aggressor, and before morning  the Table Hill camp was in ferment. Shooting broke out in three  places, though there were no casualties. When the day dawned there  existed between the two gangs a state of war more bitter than any  in their record; for this time it was no question of obscure  nonentities. Chieftain had assaulted chieftain; royal blood had  been spilt.                *    *    *    \"Comrade Windsor,\" said Psmith, when Master Maloney had spoken his  last word, \"we must take careful note of this little matter. I  rather fancy that sooner or later we may be able to turn it to our  profit. I am sorry for Dude Dawson, anyhow. Though I have never  met him, I have a sort of instinctive respect for him. A man such  as he would feel a bullet through his trouser-leg more than one of  common clay who cared little how his clothes looked.\"        CHAPTER XIX    IN PLEASANT STREET    Careful inquiries, conducted incognito by Master Maloney among the  denizens of Pleasant Street, brought the information that rents in  the tenements were collected not weekly but monthly, a fact which  must undoubtedly cause a troublesome hitch in the campaign.  Rent-day, announced Pugsy, fell on the last day of the month.    \"I rubbered around,\" he said, \"and did de sleut' act, and I finds  t'ings out. Dere's a feller comes round 'bout supper time dat day,  an' den it's up to de fam'lies what lives in de tenements to dig  down into deir jeans fer de stuff, or out dey goes dat same night.\"    \"Evidently a hustler, our nameless friend,\" said Psmith.    \"I got dat from a kid what knows anuder kid what lives dere,\"  explained Master Maloney. \"Say,\" he proceeded confidentially, \"dat  kid's in bad, sure he is. Dat second kid, de one what lives dere.  He's a wop kid, an--\"    \"A what, Comrade Maloney?\"    \"A wop. A Dago. Why, don't you get next? Why, an Italian. Sure,  dat's right. Well, dis kid, he is sure to de bad, 'cos his father  come over from Italy to work on de Subway.\"    \"I don't see why that puts him in bad,\" said Billy Windsor  wonderingly.    \"Nor I,\" agreed Psmith. \"Your narratives, Comrade Maloney, always  seem to me to suffer from a certain lack of construction. You start  at the end, and then you go back to any portion of the story which  happens to appeal to you at the moment, eventually winding up at  the beginning. Why should the fact that this stripling's father  has come over from Italy to work on the Subway be a misfortune?\"    \"Why, sure, because he got fired an' went an' swatted de foreman  one on de coco, an' de magistrate gives him t'oity days.\"    \"And then, Comrade Maloney? This thing is beginning to get clearer.  You are like Sherlock Holmes. After you've explained a thing from  start to finish--or, as you prefer to do, from finish to start--it  becomes quite simple.\"    \"Why, den dis kid's in bad for fair, 'cos der ain't nobody to  pungle de bones.\"    \"Pungle de what, Comrade Maloney?\"    \"De bones. De stuff. Dat's right. De dollars. He's all alone, dis  kid, so when de rent-guy blows in, who's to slip him over de  simoleons? It'll be outside for his, quick.\"    Billy warmed up at this tale of distress in his usual way.  \"Somebody ought to do something. It's a vile shame the kid being  turned out like that.\"    \"We will see to it, Comrade Windsor. _Cosy Moments_ shall step in. We  will combine business with pleasure, paying the stripling's rent  and corralling the rent-collector at the same time. What is today?  How long before the end of the month? Another week! A murrain on  it, Comrade Windsor. Two murrains. This delay may undo us.\"    But the days went by without any further movement on the part of  the enemy. A strange quiet seemed to be brooding over the other  camp. As a matter of fact, the sudden outbreak of active  hostilities with the Table Hill contingent had had the effect of  taking the minds of Spider Reilly and his warriors off _Cosy Moments_  and its affairs, much as the unexpected appearance of a mad bull  would make a man forget that he had come out butterfly-hunting.  Psmith and Billy could wait; they were not likely to take the  offensive; but the Table Hillites demanded instant attention.    War had broken out, as was usual between the gangs, in a somewhat  tentative fashion at first sight. There had been sniping and  skirmishes by the wayside, but as yet no pitched battle. The two  armies were sparring for an opening.                 *    *    *    The end of the week arrived, and Psmith and Billy, conducted by  Master Maloney, made their way to Pleasant Street. To get there it  was necessary to pass through a section of the enemy's country; but  the perilous passage was safely negotiated. The expedition reached  its unsavoury goal intact.    The wop kid, whose name, it appeared, was Giuseppe Orloni,  inhabited a small room at the very top of the building next to the  one Psmith and Mike had visited on their first appearance in  Pleasant Street. He was out when the party, led by Pugsy up dark  stairs, arrived; and, on returning, seemed both surprised and  alarmed to see visitors. Pugsy undertook to do the honours. Pugsy  as interpreter was energetic but not wholly successful. He appeared  to have a fixed idea that the Italian language was one easily  mastered by the "]]]
