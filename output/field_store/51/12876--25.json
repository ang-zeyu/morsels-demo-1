The ringleader was the first to fall. Next Achilles attacked the rest of  the brutal gang, till half a dozen men with broken heads lay upon the  ground. The attacking force were completely demoralized, and in dismay  fled from the field.    The ticket seller breathed a sigh of relief.    \"I thought I was done for, Mr. Henderson,\" he said, when the giant  returned flushed with his exertions. \"You are equal to half a dozen  men.\"    \"I haven't had so much exercise in a long time,\" said Achilles, panting.  \"Kit, where is the knife that scalawag was going to cut the rope with?\"    \"Here it is, Mr. Henderson.\"    \"I will keep it in remembrance of this little adventure. Perhaps I had  better go and look after the original owner.\"    He met the ruffian limping like one disabled. His look was sullen and  menacing.    \"Give me my knife,\" he growled.    \"I couldn't think of it, my man!\" said Achilles blandly. \"Evidently you  are not old enough to be trusted with a knife.\"    \"I'd like to thrash you!\" growled the miner again.    \"I've no doubt of it, my friend; your intentions are good, but can't be  carried out. And now I have a word to say,\" he continued, sternly. \"Just  get out of the lot as fast as your legs can carry you, or I'll serve you  worse than I did before.\"    The ruffian looked toward the ticket stand. He saw several of his  friends limping away like himself, looking like whipped curs, and he saw  that there was no choice for him but to obey. With a muttered oath and a  sullen scowl, he left the grounds.    \"Kit,\" said the giant, \"it won't do for me to exercise like this every  day. I shall need a second supper.\"    \"You are certainly entitled to one, Mr. Henderson,\" replied our hero.          CHAPTER XXVI.    KIT IS MADE A PRISONER.      It had been a day of exciting adventure, but so far as Kit was concerned  the end was not yet. He performed as usual, but as his second act was  over at quarter past nine, he thought, being fatigued, that he would not  wait until the close, but go at once to the circus car in which he had a  berth, and go to bed.    He crossed the lot, and emerged into the street.    It was moderately dark, there being no moon, and only the light of a few  stars to relieve the gloom.    Kit had not taken a dozen steps from the lot when two stout men  approached him, both evidently miners.    \"That's the kid that prevented my cutting the rope,\" he heard one say.    \"Is he? I saw him with the giant.\"    \"I mean to settle his hash for him,\" said the first.    Kit saw that he was in danger, and turned to run back to his friends.  But it was too late! The first speaker laid a strong arm upon his  shoulder, and his boyish strength was not able to overcome it.    \"Don't be in such a hurry, kid,\" said his captor.    \"Let me go,\" cried Kit.    \"You belong to the circus, don't you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What do you do?\"    \"I am an acrobat.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"I leap and turn somersaults, and so on.\"    \"Yes, I know. Do you remember me?\"    \"I might if it were lighter.\"    The man lit a match and held it close to his face.    \"Do you know me now?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who am I?\"    \"You are the man who tried to cut the ropes of the tent.\"    \"Right you are. I would have succeeded but for you.\"    \"I suppose you would.\"    \"Did you call that giant to pitch into me?\"    \"No; I didn't know he was near.\"    \"He treated me like a brute,\" said the man, wrathfully. \"My limbs are  aching now from the fall he gave me.\"    Kit did not answer.    \"I'd like to give him a broken head, as he gave some of my friends.  Where is he?\"    \"I suppose he is somewhere in the lot. I'll go and call him, if you want  me to.\"    \"That's too thin! Now I've got you I won't let you off so easy.\"    \"What do you intend to do?\" asked Kit becoming alarmed.    \"To give you a lesson.\"    Kit did not ask what kind of a lesson was meant, but he feared it  included bodily injury. Then at least, if never before, he wished  himself back at his uncle's house in Smyrna, uncongenial as it was  otherwise.    The first speaker spoke in a low voice to the second. Kit did not hear  the words, but judged what they were from what followed.    The two men placed him beside them, and he was sternly ordered to move  on.    They kept the road for perhaps half a mile, then turned off into a  narrow lane which appeared to ascend a hill. Finally they stopped in  front of a dark cabin, of one story, which seemed to be unoccupied. The  outer door was fastened by a bolt.    One of the men drew out a bolt, and threw open the door. A dark interior  was revealed. One of the men lit a match, throwing a fitful light upon  an empty room. At one end of the apartment was a ring, fixed in a beam,  and in the corner was a stout rope.    \"That will do,\" said the first speaker.    He took the rope, secured one end of it to the ring, and then tied Kit  firmly with the balance. It was long enough to allow of his lying down.    \"Now,\" said the first man grimly, \"I reckon the kid will be safe here  till to-morrow.\"    They prepared to leave the cabin.    \"Are you going to leave me here?\" asked Kit, in dismay.    \"Yes.\"    \"What good will it do you?\"    \"You'll see--to-morrow.\"    Kit had ten dollars in his pocket, and he thought of offering it in  return for his freedom, but it occurred to him fortunately that his  captors would deprive him of it, as it was quite within their power to  do, and not compensate him in any way. He understood by this time the  character of the men into whose hands he had fallen, and he thought it  prudent to remain silent.    As the first captor stood with the door open, while just on the point of  leaving, he said grimly, \"How do you like it, kid?\"    \"Not at all,\" answered Kit.    \"If you beg my pardon for what you did, I might let you go.\"    Kit did not believe this, and he had no intention of humiliating himself  for nothing.    \"I only did my duty,\" he said. \"I have nothing to ask pardon for.\"    \"You may change your mind--to-morrow!\"    Another ominous reference to to-morrow. Evidently he was only deferring  his vengeance, and intended to wreak it on his young prisoner the next  day.    It was not a comforting thought, nor was it calculated to sooth Kit,  weary as he was, to sleep.    The door was closed, and Kit heard the sliding of the bolt on the  outside. He was a prisoner, securely enough, and with small chance of  rescue.    Now, though Kit is my hero, I do not mean to represent him as above  human weakness, and I won't pretend that he didn't feel anxious and  disturbed. His prospects seemed very dark. He could not hope for mercy  from the brutal men who had captured him. As they could not get hold of  the giant they would undoubtedly seek to make him expiate the offenses  of Achilles Henderson as well as his own.    \"If only Mr. Henderson knew where I was,\" he said to himself, \"I should  soon be free.\"    But there seemed little hope of this. He had not told any one that he  intended to retire to the circus cars earlier than usual. The chances  were that he would not be missed till the circus company had reached the  next town on their route, ten miles away. Then there would be no clew to  his whereabouts, and even if there were he might be killed before any  help could come to him. So far as he had been able to observe, the  miners were--a portion of them, at least--a lawless set of men, who were  not likely to be influenced by considerations of pity or ordinary  humanity.    Kit had been very religiously brought up during his father's life, at  least, and he had not lost his faith in an overruling Providence. So in  this great peril it was natural for him to pray to God for deliverance  from danger. When his prayer was concluded, he felt easier, and in spite  of his disagreeable surroundings he managed to fall asleep.    Meanwhile the circus performance terminated, and preparations were  commenced for the journey to the next town. The canvas men swarmed  around the tents and swiftly took them down and conveyed them to the  freight cars, where they assisted the razorbacks to pack them in small  compass.    Harry Thorne, who had his berth next to Kit, turned in rather late. He  looked into Kit's bed, and to his surprise found it unoccupied.    \"What can have become of the boy?\" he asked himself.    He went outside, and espying Achilles Henderson, he said: \"Have you seen  anything of Kit Watson?\"    \"Isn't he in his berth?\" asked Mr. Henderson, surprised.    \"No.\"    Inquiry developed the fact that Kit had not been seen by any one since  the conclusion of his act.    \"I am afraid the boy has come to harm,\" said Achilles. \"This is a rough  place, and there are plenty of tough characters about, as our experience  this afternoon showed.\"    \"What shall we do? The cars will soon be starting, and we must leave him  behind.\"    \"If he doesn't show up before that time, I will stay behind and hunt him  up. He is too good a boy to be left to his fate.\"          CHAPTER XXVII.    A MINER'S CABIN.      Kit's principal captor was known as Dick Hayden. He was an Englishman,  and a leader in every kind of mischief. If there was any disturbance  between the miners and their employers, he was generally found to be at  the bottom of it. A naturally quarrelsome disposition was intensified by  intemperance. In the attack upon the circus tents he found himself in  his element. His ignominious defeat made him ugly and revengeful.    His wife was dead, but he had one child, Janet, a girl of thirteen, who  cooked for him and took care of his cabin. The poor girl had a hard time  of it, but she endeavored so far as possible to avoid trouble with her  brutal parent.    It was near ten o'clock when Hayden came home after locking Kit in the  deserted cabin. He had gone away without supper, but late as it was,  Janet had something hot ready for him on the stove.    \"Well, Janet, child, have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#19)"],[1,"shaven, unkempt and with tattered  clothing. They were indeed a pitiful sight. All that day they marched  steadily on toward Ust Padenga. To add to the difficulty of the march, a  light snow had fallen which made the roads a mere quagmire. Late that  night we arrived at the position of Ust Padenga, which was to become our  winter quarters and where later so many of our brave men were to lay  down their lives in the snow and cold of the Russian forests.    With small delay for rest or recuperation we at once began preparation  for the defense of this position. Our main position and the artillery  were stationed in a small village called Netsvetyavskaya, situated on a  high bluff by the side of which meandered the Vaga River. In front of  this bluff flowed the Padenga River, a small tributary of the Vaga, and  at our right, all too close for safety, was located the forest. About  one thousand yards directly ahead of us was located the village of Ust  Padenga proper, which was garrisoned by a company of Russian soldiers.  To our right and about seventeen hundred yards ahead of us on another  bluff was located the village of Nijni Gora, to be the scene of fierce  fighting in the snow.    On the last day of October Company \"A\", which had been on this front for  some forty days without a relief, were relieved by Company \"C\" and a  battery of Canadian Artillery was also brought up to reinforce this  position.    All was now rather quiet on this front, but rumors more and more  definite were coming in daily that the Bolo was getting ready to launch  a big drive on this front. From the location of our troops here, several  hundred miles and more from our base on the Dvina and with long drawn  out lines of communication, some of the stations forty miles or so  apart, it was apparent that if attacked by a large force, we would have  to give way. It was also plainly apparent that in case the Vaga River  force was driven back to the Dvina it would necessitate the withdrawal  of the forces on the Dvina from their strongly fortified position at  Toulgas--consequently, we received orders that this position at Ust  Padenga must be held at all cost. Such was the critical position of the  Americans sent up the river by order of General Poole on a veritable  fool's errand. The folly of his so-called \"active defense\" of Archangel  was to be exposed most plainly at Ust Padenga and Shenkursk in winter.    By the middle of November the enemy was becoming more and more active in  this vicinity. On the seventeenth day of November a small patrol of  Americans and Canadians were ambushed and only one man, a Canadian,  escaped. The ambush occurred in the vicinity of Trogimovskaya, a village  about eight versts below Ust Padenga, where it was known that the Bolo  was concentrating troops.    On the morning of November 29th, acting under orders from British  Headquarters, a strong patrol, numbering about one hundred men, was sent  out at daybreak, under Lieut. Cuff of \"C\" Company, to drive the enemy  out of this position. The only road or trail leading into this town ran  through a dense forest. The snow, of course, was so deep in the forest  that it was impossible to proceed by any other route than this roadway  or trail. As this patrol was approaching one of the most dense portions  of the forest they were suddenly met by an overwhelming attacking party,  which had been concealed in the forest. The woods were literally  swarming with them and after a sharp fight Lieut. Francis Cuff, one of  the bravest and most fearless officers in the expedition, in command of  the patrol, succeeded in withdrawing his platoon.    A detachment of the patrol on the edge of the woods skirting the Vaga  River was having considerable difficulty extricating itself, however,  and without faltering Lieut. Cuff immediately deployed his men and  opened fire again upon the enemy. During this engagement, he, with  several other daring men, became separated from their fellows and it was  at this time that he was severely wounded. He and his men, several of  whom were also wounded, although cut off and completely surrounded,  fought like demons and sold their lives dearly, as was evidenced by the  enemy dead strewn about in the snow near them. The remains of these  heroic men were later recovered and removed to Shenkursk, where they  were buried almost under the shadows of the cathedral located there.    During this period the thermometer was daily descending lower and lower;  snow was falling continually and the days were so short and dark that  one could hardly distinguish day from night. These long nights of bitter  cold, with death stalking at our sides, was a terrible strain upon the  troops. Sentries standing watch in the lonely snow and cold were  constantly having feet, hands, and other parts of their anatomy frozen.  Their nerves were on edge and they were constantly firing upon white  objects that could be seen now and then prowling around in the snow.  These objects as we later found were enemy troops clad in white clothing  which made it almost impossible to detect them.    About this time an epidemic of \"flu\" broke out in some of the villages.  In view of the Russian custom of keeping the doors and windows of their  houses practically sealed during the winter and with their utter  disregard for the most simple sanitary precautions, small wonder it was  that in a short time the epidemic was raging in practically every  village within our lines. The American Red Cross and medical officers of  the expedition at once set to work to combat the epidemic as far as the  means at their disposal would permit. The Russian peasant, of course, in  true fatalist fashion calmly accepted this situation as an inevitable  act of Providence, which made the task of the Red Cross workers and  others more difficult. The workers, however, devoted themselves to their  errand of mercy night and day and gradually the epidemic was checked.  This voluntary act of mercy and kindness had a great effect upon the  peasantry of the region and doubtless gave them a better and more kindly  opinion of the strangers in their midst than all the efforts of our  artillery and machine guns ever could have done. And when in the winter  horses and sleighs meant life or death to the doughboys, the peasants  were true to their American soldier friends.    After the fatal ambush of Lieutenant Cuff's patrol at Ust Padenga, \"C\"  Company, was relieved about the first of December by Company \"A.\" During  the remainder of the month there was more or less activity on both sides  of the line. About the fifth or sixth of the month, the enemy brought up  several batteries of light field artillery in the dense forests and  begun an artillery bombardment of our entire line. Fortunately, however,  we soon located the position of their guns and our artillery horses were  immediately hitched to the guns, and supported by two platoons of \"A\"  Company under Captain Odjard and Lieut. Collar, swung into a position  from which they obtained direct fire upon the enemy guns with the result  that four guns were shortly thereafter put out of commission.    From this time on, there were continual skirmishes between the outposts  and patrols. The Bolo's favorite time for patrolling was at night and  during the early hours of the morning when everything was pitch dark.  They all wore white smocks over their uniforms and they could easily  advance within fifteen or twenty feet of our sentries and outposts  without being seen. They were not always so fortunate, however, in this  reconnoitering, as a picture on a following page proves which shows one  of their scouts clad in the white uniform and cap, who was shot down by  one of our sentries when he was less than fifteen feet away from the  sentry. Outside of the terrific cold and the natural hardships of the  expedition, the month of December was comparatively quiet on the Padenga  front.    However, in the neighborhood of Shenkursk there was a growing feeling  that a number of the enemy troops were in nearby villages and that the  enemy was constantly occupying more and more of them daily. In order to  break up this growing movement and to assure the natives of the  Shenkursk region that we would brook no such interference or happenings  within our lines, on the fifth of December, a strong detachment,  consisting of Company \"C\" under Lieut. Weeks, and Russian infantry,  mounted Cossacks, and a pom pom detachment, set out for Kodima about  fifty versts north and east of Shenkursk toward the Dvina River.    It was reported that there were about one hundred and fifty or two  hundred of the enemy located in this village, who were breaking a trail  through from the Dvina River in order that they could send across  supporting troops from the Dvina for the attack on Shenkursk. Our  detachment, after a day and a half's march, arrived in the vicinity of  Kodima and prepared to take the position. At about the moment when the  attack was to begin, it was found that the pom poms and the Vickers guns  were not working. The thermometer at this time stood at fifty below zero  and the intense cold had frozen the oil in the buffers of the pom poms  and machine guns, rendering them worse than useless. Fortunately, this  was discovered in time to prevent any casualties, for it was later found  that there were between five hundred and one thousand of the enemy  located in this position and that they were intrenched in prepared  positions and well equipped with rifles, machine guns and artillery.    Our forces, of course, were compelled to retreat, but this maneuver  naturally gave the enemy greater courage and the following week it was  reported that they were advancing from Kodima on Shenkursk. We at once  dispatched a large force of infantry, artillery, and mounted Cossacks to  delay this advance. This maneuver was also a miserable failure, and it  is not difficult to understand the reason"]]]
