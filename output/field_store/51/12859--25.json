As a rule, the cinquecento  topographers give a prominent place in their books to the _columna  Maenia_, the _columna Lactaria_, the _senaculum mulierum_, the _pila  Tiburtina_, the _pila Horatia_ and other equally unimportant works  which, for reasons unknown to us, had forcibly struck their fancy. The  fashion died out in course of time, but never entirely. Some of these  more or less fanciful structures still live in our books, and in the  imagination of the people. The place of honor, in this line, belongs  to Caligula's bridge, which is supposed to have crossed the valley of  the Forum at a prodigious height, so as to enable the young monarch to  walk on a level from his Palatine house to the Temple of Jupiter on  the Capitol. This bridge is not only mentioned in guide-books, and  pointed out to strangers on their first visit to the Forum, but is  also drawn and described in works of a higher standard,[55] in which  the bridge is represented from \"remains concealed under a house, which  have been carefully examined and measured, as well as drawn by  architectural draughtsmen of much experience.\"    The bridge never existed. Caligula made use of the roofs of edifices  which were already there, spanning only the gaps of the streets with  temporary wooden passages. This is clearly stated by Suetonius in  chapters xxii. and xxxvii. and by Flavius Josephus, \"Antiq. Jud.\" xix.  1, 11. From the palace at the northeast corner of the Palatine, he  crossed the roof of the _templum divi Augusti_, then the _fastigium  basilicae Juliae_, and lastly the Temple of Saturn close to the  Capitolium. The Street of Victory which divided the emperor's palace  from the Temple of Augustus, the Street of the Tuscans which divided  the temple from the basilica, and the Vicus Iugarius between the  basilica and the Temple of Saturn, were but a few feet wide and could  easily be crossed by means of a _passerelle_. We are told by Suetonius  and Josephus how Caligula used sometimes to interrupt his aerial  promenade midway, and throw handfuls of gold from the roof of the  basilica to the crowd assembled below. I have mentioned this bridge  because the words of Suetonius, _supra templum divi Augusti ponte  transmisso_, gave me the first clew towards the identification of the  splendid ruins which tower just behind the church of S. Maria  Liberatrice, between it and the rotunda of S. Teodoro.    The position of Caligula's palace at the northeast corner of the  Palatine being well known, as also the site of the Basilica Julia, it  is evident that the building which stands between the two must be the  Temple of Augustus. This conclusion is so simple that I wonder that no  one had mentioned it before my first announcement in 1881. The last  nameless remains adjoining the Forum have thus regained their place  and their identity in the topography of this classic quarter.    [Illustration: Plan of the Temple of Augustus.]    [Illustration: Remains of the Temple of Augustus, from a sketch by  Ligorio.]    The construction of a temple in honor of the deified founder of the  empire was begun by his widow Livia, and Tiberius, his adopted son,  and completed by Caligula. An inscription discovered in 1726, in the  Columbaria of Livia on the Appian Way, mentions a C. Julius Bathyllus,  sacristan or keeper of the temple. Pliny (xii. 19, 42) describes,  among the curiosities of the place, a root of a cinnamon-tree, of  extraordinary size, placed by Livia on a golden tray. The relic was  destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus. Domitian must have restored  the building, because the rear wall of the temple, the _murus post  templum divi Augusti ad Minervam_, is mentioned in contemporary  documents as the place on which state notices were posted. It has been  excavated but once, in June, 1549, when the Forum, the Sacra Via and  the Street of the Tuscans were ransacked to supply marbles and lime  for the building of S. Peter's. Two documents show the wonderful state  of preservation in which the temple was found. One is a sketch, taken  in 1549, by Pirro Ligorio, which, through the kindness of Professor T.  H. Middleton,[56] I reproduce from the original, in the Bodleian  Library; the other is a description of the discovery by Panvinius.[57]  The place was in such good condition that even the statue and altar  of Vortumnus, described by Livy, Asconius, Varro and others, were  found lying at the foot of the steps of the temple.      THE SACELLUM SANCI, or Shrine of Sancus on the Quirinal.[58] The  worship of _Semo Sancus Sanctus Dius Fidius_ was imported into Rome at  a very early period, by the Sabines who first colonized the Quirinal  Hill. He was considered the Genius of heavenly light, the son of  Jupiter _Diespiter_ or _Lucetius_, the avenger of dishonesty, the  upholder of truth and good faith, whose mission upon earth was to  secure the sanctity of agreements, of matrimony, and hospitality.  Hence his various names and his identification with the Roman  Hercules, who was likewise invoked as a guardian of the sanctity of  oaths (_me-Hercle_, _me-Dius Fidius_). There were two shrines of Semo  Sancus in ancient Rome, one built by the Sabines on the Quirinal, near  the modern church of S. Silvestro, from which the _Porta Sanqualis_ of  the Servian walls was named, the other built by the Romans on the  Island of the Tiber (S. Bartolomeo) near the Temple of Jupiter  Jurarius. Justin, the apologist and martyr, laboring under the  delusion that Semo Sancus and Simon the Magician were the same,  describes the altar on the island of S. Bartolomeo as sacred to the  latter.[59] He must have glanced hurriedly at the first three names of  the Sabine god,--SEMONI SANCO DEO,--and translated them [Greek: SIMONI  DEO SANKTO]. The altar on which these names were written, the very one  seen and described by S. Justin, was discovered on the same island, in  July, 1574, during the pontificate of Gregory XIII. The altar is  preserved in the Galleria Lapidaria of the Vatican Museum, in the  first compartment (_Dii_).    The shrine on the Quirinal is minutely described by classical writers.  It was hypaethral, that is, without a roof, so that the sky could be  seen by the worshippers of the \"Genius of heavenly light.\" The oath  _me-Dius Fidius_ could not be taken except in the open air. The chapel  contained relics of the kingly period, the wool, distaff, spindle, and  slippers of Tanaquil, and brass _clypea_ or medallions, made of money  confiscated from Vitruvius Vaccus.    [Illustration: Statue of Semo Sancus.]    Its foundations were discovered in March, 1881, under what was  formerly the convent of S. Silvestro al Quirinale, now the  headquarters of the Royal Engineers. The monument is a parallelogram  in shape, thirty-five feet long by nineteen feet wide, with walls of  travertine, and decorations of white marble; and it is surrounded by  votive altars and pedestals of statues. I am not sure whether the  remarkable work of art which I shall describe presently was found in  this very place, but it is a strange coincidence that, during the  progress of the excavations at S. Silvestro, a statue of Semo Sancus  and a pedestal inscribed with his name should have appeared in the  antiquarian market of the city.    The statue, reproduced here from a heliogravure, is life-sized, and  represents a nude youth, of archaic type. His attitude may be compared  to that of some early representations of Apollo, but the expression of  the face and the modelling of some parts of the body are realistic  rather than conventional. Both hands are missing, so that it is  impossible to state what were the attributes of the god. Visconti  thinks they may have been the _avis Sanqualis_ or _ossifraga_, and the  club of Hercules. The inscription on the pedestal is very much like  that seen by S. Justin:--    SEMONI. SANCO. DEO. FIDIO. SACRUM. DECURIA. SACERDOT[UM] BIDENTALIUM.    According to Festus, _bidentalia_ were small shrines of second-rate  divinities, to whom _bidentes_, lambs two years old, were sacrificed.  For this reason the priests of Semo were called _sacerdotes  bidentales_. They were organized, like a lay corporation, in a  _decuria_ under the presidency of a _magister quinquennalis_. Their  residence, adjoining the chapel, was ample and commodious, with an  abundant supply of water. The lead pipe by which this was distributed  through the establishment was discovered at the same time and in the  same place with the bronze statues of athletes described in chapter  xi. of my \"Ancient Rome.\"    The pipe has been removed to the Capitoline Museum, the statue and its  pedestal have been purchased by Pope Leo XIII. and placed in the  Galleria dei Candelabri, and the foundations of the shrine have been  destroyed.

Somehow, when it snows I always feel  like whistling and singing.\"    \"And I feel like making up verses,\" murmured the poet of the school, and  went on:        \"Oh, the snow, the beautiful snow,      Coming down when the wind does blow.      Coming down both day and night,      Leaving the earth a wonderful sight!      Oh, the snow, the heavenly snow!----\"        \"Wetting our feet wherever we go!\"    continued Tom, and added:        \"Oh, the snow,      When the wind doth blow,      It sets a pace      And hits our face      And we are froze      Down to the toes      And in the slush,      That's just like mush,      We cannot stop,      But go ker-flop!\"    \"Tom, the first thing you know, you'll be taking Songbird's laurels away  from him,\" observed Larry.    \"Perish the thought!\" answered the fun-loving Rover, tragically.    \"I don't hope you call that poetry,\" came from Songbird, in deep  disgust. \"Why, Hans can do better than that; can't you, Dutchy?\"    \"Sure, I can make up some find boetry,\" answered Hans. \"Chust you listen  to dis. I make him ub von night ven I couldn't go to sleep.\"        \"Der vos a leetle pird,           He sits ubon a dree,      Dot leetle pird vos habby           Like von leetle pird could be      A hunter mit a gun           Py dot tree did lay,      He shoot his awful gun,           And dot pird--he fly avay!    \"Good for Hans!\" cried Dick, and there was a general laugh. Then the  gathering in the library broke up and all the cadets went outside to see  how the snow looked. Before long there was enough on the ground to make  snowballs, and then a battle royal all around ensued. So long as they  took care not to break any windows, Captain Putnam did not mind this,  and from his office the master of the Hall and George Strong watched the  sport.    \"Makes one feel young again,\" remarked the captain to his first  assistant.    \"I'd half like to go out myself,\" answered George Strong.    \"I remember one year we had a great snowball fight at West Point,\" went  on the captain. \"It was carried out in regular army fashion and lasted  half a day. Our side was victorious, but we had to fight desperately to  win. I was struck in the chin and the ear, and three of the cadets were  knocked unconscious. But it was good practice, for it showed us  something of what a hand-to-hand struggle meant.\"    The snow came down all that day and night, and by the following morning  covered the ground to the depth of about a foot. It was somewhat moist  and first-class for the making of snow men and snowballs.    \"Let's make a statue of Captain Putnam,\" said Fred, and this was done,  the statue being nearly ten feet high. It must be confessed it was not a  very good likeness, but it looked remarkably fierce with some straws for  a moustache, a flat wooden stick for a sword, and an old army cap on the  top of the head. When he saw it, Captain Putnam laughed as heartily as  anybody. Old as he was getting, he never allowed himself to forget the  time when he was a boy.    Some distance from the Hall was a fair-sized hill and this was used by  the cadets for coasting. As soon as school was over that day the lads  brought out their sleds and bobs, and soon the hill was filled with  boys, their merry laughter ringing far and wide. The Rovers had a big  bob and this was used by the three and also by several of their friends.    \"I'll race you!\" shouted Dick, who was in charge of the bob. He  addressed another student named Peter Slade. Slade had a big bob and had  been boasting that this could beat any other bob on the hill.    \"All right,\" answered Slade. He was a lanky youth, rather lazy, and  given to much boasting.    It was soon arranged that each bob should carry six boys, and Fred, Hans  and Songbird went with the Rovers. The two bobs lined up side by side,  and Larry Colby gave the word to go.    \"We're off!\" shouted Tom, giving a shove, and leaping on behind.    At first the two bobs kept side by side. The slide was in fine  condition, and all the other cadets lined up on either side to watch the  outcome of the race.    \"Hurrah for the Rovers!\"    \"Hurrah for Peter Slade!\"    \"May the best bob win!\" cried one student, enthusiastically.    \"Here's luck to you, Tom!\" shouted George Granbury, and threw a snowball  that caught Tom in the neck.    \"Thanks!\" shouted Tom, shaking his fist. \"I'll pay that back with  interest when I get the chance.\"    Half of the course was soon covered and still the bobs kept side by  side. But then the Rovers' bob began to drag behind.    \"Hurrah, we are going to win!\" cried one of the boys on the other bob.    \"Said I could beat you!\" yelled Peter Slade to Dick.    \"The race isn't ended yet,\" flung back the eldest Rover boy.    On and on went the two bobs, and gradually that belonging to Peter Slade  drew a full length ahead. Dick glanced back anxiously.    \"Something seems to be catching under the runners,\" he said, \"Look and  see if everything is clear.\"    The boys behind looked, and then of a sudden Songbird let out a cry.    \"It is Hans' tippet! Hans, go and put that tippet end around your neck  and don't let it drag under the bob!\"    The German youth was wearing an old-fashion tippet around his neck, the  loose ends flying behind. One end had gotten under the bob runners and  was scratching along in the snow.    \"Vell I neffer!\" cried Hans, and pulled on the tippet so vigorously that  the long bob began to switch around sideways.    \"Look out there!\" sang out Sam. \"Don't throw us off!\"    \"Wait, I'll loosen the tippet,\" came from Songbird, and guided the  muffler free of the bob. Then Hans took up the ends and tied them around  his waist.    The drag had caused the Rovers' bob to get two lengths behind the other,  and Peter Slade and his companions felt certain of winning.    \"You can't touch us, Dick Rover!\" called Slade, triumphantly.    \"Good-bye!\" called another boy. \"We'll tell those at the bottom of the  hill that you are coming.\"    \"Are we making better time?\" questioned Tom, anxiously. \"If we are not  I'll get off and shove,\" he added, jokingly.    \"You hold tight now!\" yelled Dick, and an instant later the bob went  down over a ridge of the hill. Free of the drag, it shot forth like an  arrow from a bow, and soon began to crawl up to Peter Slade's turnout.    \"The Rovers are crawling up!\"    \"Yes, but it's too late to win!\"    \"We've got to win!\" called out Sam.    And then both bobs took another ridge and rushed on to the end of the  course, less than a hundred yards away.          CHAPTER XXII    PELEG SNUGGERS' QUEER RIDE      The race had now reached its critical point and all of the cadets on the  hill waited for the outcome with keen interest. The bob owned by Peter  Slade was still two lengths in advance, and it looked very much as if  Peter would be the victor.    But with the passing of the last ridge the Rovers' bob seemed to become  endowed with new life. With no drag on the runners, it shot forward with  a speed that surprised even Dick. Steadily it gained on the other bob,  until, when the end of the course was but fifty yards away, the two were  almost side by side.    \"Let her out, Pete!\" cried one of the boys on Slade's bob, but Peter  could do no more.    \"It's a tie race!\" called several, but hardly had the words been spoken  when the Rovers' bob shot ahead, and reached the end of the course a  winner by twenty-five feet.    \"Hurrah! the Rovers win!\"    \"I tell you what, you can't get ahead of Dick Rover and his crowd!\"    Peter Slade was much chagrinned to have the victory snatched from him,  and began to mutter something about the race not being a fair one.    \"I agree with you, it was not fair,\" answered Sam. \"Hans' tippet caught  under our runners and held us up a good deal.\"    \"If it hadn't been for that we would have won by three times the  distance,\" added Tom.    \"Humph!\" muttered Peter Slade. \"I guess you jumped off once and pushed.\"    \"I did not,\" answered Tom, hotly.    \"I think you did.\"    \"And I say I didn't,\" and now Tom doubled up his fists.    \"Oh, don't quarrel,\" put in Larry, who was near. \"If Peter isn't  satisfied why not race over again?\"    \"I am willing,\" answered Dick, promptly.    \"I'm tired of riding,\" said Slade. \"I--er--I am not feeling extra well  and it shakes me up too much.\"    \"Then let some of the others use the bob.\"    \"No, it needs overhauling, and I am going to have it fixed up,\" was  Slade's answer, and began to move off toward the Hall, dragging his bob  after him.    \"He's afraid to race,\" said George. \"My! how mad it makes some fellows  to get beaten!\"    It may be mentioned here that Peter Slade had been one of Tad Sobber's  cronies, and now that Sobber was gone he took it on his shoulders to  fill the bully's place in the particular set to which he belonged. He  was a quick-tempered youth, and had been in more than one fight since  his arrival at Putnam Hall.    The boys who could not ride on the hill amused themselves by making some  big snowballs, which they allowed to roll down another hill. One of the  snowballs made was fully eight feet in diameter, and it was a great  sight to see this go down, getting bigger and bigger as it progressed.    \"Hello, I've got an idea!\" cried Tom, as he watched the rolling of the  big snowballs.    \"Something brand new, Tom?\" queried Larry.    \"I think so. Let us give Peleg Snuggers a roll. It will do him  good--shake up his liver, and all that.\"    \"You mean to roll him down this hill?\" asked a student named Morley.    \"That's it.\"    \"Might hurt him.\"    \"Not if we put a snow overcoat on him first,\" answered Tom.    \"What do you mean?\" asked another student.    \"Let us roll a big ball the shape of an egg and hollow out the middle.  Then by some trick we can get Peleg to crawl inside, and----\"    \"That's the thing!\" cried George Garrison. \"Come on. Where is Peleg?\"    \"Down at the stables.\"    With eager hands the cadets set to"]]]
