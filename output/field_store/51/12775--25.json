We shall find for other reasons also that there is           no need to stretch the meaning of the words [Greek: up auten           pros noton] to make them cover territory something like half a           mile to the eastward, and to include the later Olympieum within           the limits of our early city.             Wachsmuth has well said,[122] although this is not invariably           true,[123] that [Greek: upo ten acropolin] and [Greek: upo te  Page 60  acropolei] are used with reference to objects lying halfway up           the slope of the Acropolis. On the next page he adds, however,           that Thucydides could not have meant to describe as the ancient           city simply the ground enclosed within the Pelasgic           fortifications, or he would have mentioned these in the [Greek:           tekmeria]. Thucydides, in the passage quoted, wished to show           that the city of Cecrops was very small in comparison with the           later city of Theseus; that the Acropolis was inhabited; and           that the habitations did not extend beyond the narrow limits of           the fortifications. He distinctly says that before the time of           Theseus, the Acropolis was the city. He proceeds to give the           reasons for his view: The presence of the ancient temples on the           Acropolis itself, the fact that the ancient precincts outside           the Acropolis were [Greek: pros touto to meros tes poleôs], and           the neighborhood of the fountain Enneacrounus. We know, that the           Acropolis was still officially called [Greek: polis] in           Thucydides' day; and [Greek: polis] so used would have no           meaning if the Acropolis itself was not the ancient city.           [Greek: Pros touto to meros], in the passage quoted, refers to           the city of Cecrops, the Acropolis and Pelasgicum taken           together; and [Greek: tes poleôs] refers to the entire later           city as it existed in the time of Thucydides. It is, however,           in the four temples outside the Acropolis included under the           [Greek: tekmerion de] that we are particularly interested. The           Pythium of the passage cannot be that Pythium close by the           present Olympieum, which was founded by Pisistratus. Pausanias           (I. 28, 4,) says: \"On the descent [from the Acropolis], not in           the lower part of the city but just below the Propylæa, is a           spring of water, and close by a shrine of Apollo in a cave. It           is believed that here Apollo met Creusa.\" Probably it was           because this cave was the earliest abode of Apollo in Athens           that Euripides placed here the scene of the meeting of Apollo           and Creusa.             [Footnote 122: _Berichte der philol.-histor. Classe der Königl.           Sächs. Gesell. der Wiss._, 1887, p. 383.]             [Footnote 123: _Am. Jour. of Archæology_, III. 38, ff.]             According to Dr. Dörpfeld it was opposite this Pythium that the           Panathenaic ship came to rest.[124] In _Ion_, 285, Euripides           makes it clear that, from the wall near the Pythium, the           watchers looked toward Harma for that lightning which was the           signal for the sending of the offering to Delphi. This passage           would have no meaning if referred to lightning to be seen by  Page 61  looking toward Harma from any position near the existing           Olympieum; for the rocks referred to by Euripides are to the           northwest, and so could not be visible from the later Pythium.           To be sure, in later times the official title of the Apollo of           the cave seems to have been [Greek: up' acraiô] or [Greek:           en acrais], but this was only after such a distinction became           necessary from the increased number of Apollo precincts in the           city. The inscriptions referring to the cave in this manner are           without exception of Roman date.[125] From Strabo we learn[126]           that the watch looked \"toward Harma\" from an altar to Zeus           Astrapæus on the wall between the Pythium and the Olympieum.           This wall has always been a source of trouble to those who place           the Pythium in question near the present Olympieum. But this           difficulty vanishes if we accept the authority of Euripides,           for the altar of Zeus Astrapæus becomes located on the           northwest wall of the Acropolis; and from this lofty position           above the Pythium, with an unobstructed view of the whole           northern horizon, it is most natural to expect to see these           flashes from Harma.             [Footnote 124: PHILOSTRAT. _Vit. Sophist._ II p. 236.]             [Footnote 125: HARRISON and Verrall, _Mythology and Monuments_,           p. 541.]             [Footnote 126: STRABO, p. 404.]             The Olympieum mentioned by Strabo and Thucydides cannot           therefore be the famous structure begun by Pisistratus and           dedicated by Hadrian: we must look for another on the northwest           side of the Acropolis. Here, it must be admitted we could wish           for fuller evidence. Pausanias (I. 18. 8) informs us that \"they           say Deucalion built the old sanctuary of Zeus Olympius.\"           Unfortunately he does not say where it was located.             Mr. Penrose in an interesting paper read before the British           School at Athens in the spring of 1891, setting forth the           results of his latest investigations at the Olympieum, said           that in the course of his investigations there appeared           foundations which he could ascribe to no other building than           this most ancient temple. But Dr. Dörpfeld, after a careful           examination of these remains, declares that they could by no           possibility belong to the sanctuary of the legendary           Deucalion.[127]             [Footnote 127: It has been held that Pausanias mentions the           tomb of Deucalion, which was near the existing Olympieum, as a           proof that Deucalion's temple was also here. Pausanias however           merely says in this passage that this tomb was pointed out in           his day only as a proof that Deucalion sojourned at Athens.]    Page 62  The abandonment of work on the great temple of the Olympian           Zeus from the time of the Pisistratids to that of Antiochus           Epiphanes, would have left the Athenians without a temple of           Zeus for 400 years, unless there existed elsewhere a foundation           in his honor. It is on its face improbable that the citizens           would have allowed so long a time to pass unless they already           possessed some shrine to which they attached the worship and           festivals of the chief of the gods.             The spade has taught us that the literary record of old           sanctuaries is far from being complete. The new cutting for the           Piræus railroad has brought to light inscriptions referring to           a hitherto unknown precinct in the Ceramicus.             Mommsen declares[128] that the Olympia were celebrated at the           Olympieum which was begun by Pisistratus; and he adds that the           festival was probably established by him. Of the more ancient           celebration in honor of Zeus, the Diasia, he can only say           surely that it was held outside the city. Certainly we should           expect the older festival to have its seat at the older           sanctuary.             The [Greek: exô tes poleôs], [129] which is Mommsen's authority           in the passage referred to above, has apparently the same           meaning as the [Greek: ta exô (tes poleôs)] already quoted from           Thucydides; _i.e._, outside of the ancient city--the Acropolis           and Pelasgicum. The list of dual sanctuaries, the earlier by the           entrance to the Acropolis, the later to the southeast, is quite           a long one. We find two precincts of Apollo, of Zeus, of Ge,           and, as we shall see later, of Dionysus.             Of Ge Olympia we learn[130] that she had a precinct within the           enclosure of the later Olympieum. Pausanias by his mention of           the cleft in the earth through which the waters of the flood           disappeared and of the yearly offerings of the honey-cake in           connection with this, shows the high antiquity of certain rites           here celebrated. It is indeed most probable that these           ceremonies formed a part of the Chytri; for what seems the more           ancient portion of this festival pertains also to the worship           of those who perished in Deucalion's flood. The worship of Ge           _Kourotrophos_ goes back to times immemorial. Pausanias  Page 63  mentions[131] as the last shrines which he sees before entering           the upper city, those of Ge _Kourotrophos_ and Demeter Chloe,           which must therefore have been situated on the southwest slope           of the Acropolis. Here again near the entrance to the Pelasgic           fortification, is where we should expect _a priori_ to find the           oldest religious foundations \"outside the Polis.\"             [Footnote 128: Heortologie, p. 413.]             [Footnote 129: THUCYDIDES 126.]             [Footnote 130: PAUS. I. 18. 7.]             [Footnote 131: PAUS. I. 22. 33. SUIDAS, [Greek: courotrophos].]             The location of the fourth _hieron_ of Thucydides can best be           determined by means of the festivals, more particularly the           dramatic festivals of Dionysus. That the dramatic           representations at the Greater Dionysia, the more splendid of           the festivals, were held on the site of the existing theatre of           Dionysus, perhaps from the beginning, at least from a very           early period, all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#19)"],[1,"ticipation: AfDB, AG (observer), AsDB,  Australia Group, BIS, BSEC (observer), CCC, CE, CEI, CERN, EAPC, EBRD,  ECE, EIB, ESA, EU, FAO, G- 9, IADB, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICFTU,  ICRM, IDA, IEA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Intelsat, Interpol,  IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, MINUGUA, MINURSO, MTCR, NAM (guest), NEA, NSG, OAS  (observer), OECD, OSCE, PCA, PFP, UN, UNCTAD, UNDOF, UNESCO, UNFICYP,  UNHCR, UNIDO, UNIKOM, UNITAR, UNMIBH, UNMOT, UNOMIG, UNRWA, UNTSO,  UNU, UPU, WCL, WEU (observer), WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTrO, ZC    Diplomatic representation in the US:  chief of mission: Ambassador Helmut TUERK  chancery: 3524 International Court NW, Washington, DC 20008-3035  telephone: [1] (202) 895-6700  FAX: [1] (202) 895-6750  consulate(s) general: Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York    Diplomatic representation from the US:  chief of mission: Ambassador Kathryn Walt HALL  embassy: Boltzmanngasse 16, A-1091, Vienna  mailing address: use embassy street address  telephone: [43] (1) 313-39  FAX: [43] (1) 310-0682    Flag description: three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white,  and red    @Austria:Economy    Economy-overview: Austria, a member of the European Union since 1  January 1995, has a well-developed market economy with a high standard  of living. With exports of goods and services reaching over 40% of  GDP, Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member  countries, especially with Germany. Austria's entry into the EU has  drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to  the single European market. Austria is well on its way to meeting all  Maastricht convergence criteria for monetary union, through  privatization efforts, the 1996-98 budget consolidation programs, and  austerity measures, which were expected to bring total public sector  deficit down to 3% of GDP in 1997 and public debt in line with the 60%  of GDP required by the EU. Cuts mainly affect the civil service and  Austria's generous social system, the two major causes of the  government deficit. To meet increased competition from both the EU and  Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize  knowledge-based sectors of the economy and deregulate the service  sector, particularly telecommunications and the energy sector.
