During those few moments a man could enter the chamber,  get the Nightingale Gisar, and escape. But even then he might not be  safe for the Flower o' the World might gather her army together and  pursue him.\"    \"Now tell me how to reach the palace of that Warrior Princess, Flower o'  the World.\"    \"You could never get there alone,\" they told him, \"the way is too long  and the dangers are too many. Stay here with us for three months and at  the end of three months we will carry you thither on our wings.\"    So for three months the Youngest Brother stayed on in the hut with the  old woman and her three daughters. The three daughters flew in their  eagle shirts to the spring of the Water of Life and bathing in that  magic pool they made grow on again the beak and the wing and the leg  which the Youngest Brother had hacked off.    At the end of three months they carried the Youngest Brother on their  wings to the distant kingdom where the Warrior Princess, Flower o' the  World, lived.    At midnight they set him down in front of the palace and he slipped  unseen through the guards at the gate and through the halls of the  palace to the Princess's own chamber. The lion, the wolf, and the tiger  were asleep and he was able to push back the curtain before which they  were lying and creep up to the Princess's very bedside without being  discovered.    He looked once at the sleeping Flower o' the World and she was so  beautiful that he dared not look again for fear he should forget the  Nightingale Gisar and betray himself by crying out.    At the head of the bed were four lighted candles and at the foot four  unlighted ones. He blew out the lighted ones and lit the others. Then  quickly he took the golden cage in which the Nightingale Gisar was  perched asleep, unfastened it from the golden chain on which it was  hanging, and hurried out. The eagles were waiting for him and at once  they spread their wings and carried him away.    They put him down at the crossroads where he had parted from his  brothers just one year before. Then they bade him farewell and flew off  to their home in the desert.    \"My brothers will probably be here in an hour or so,\" the Youngest Son  thought. \"I had better wait for them.\"    He felt sleepy, so he lay down by the roadside and closed his eyes.    While he slept his brothers arrived and of course the first thing they  saw was the golden cage and the Nightingale Gisar.    Then envy and hatred filled their hearts and they began cursing and  complaining to think that he who was the Youngest had succeeded where  they had failed.    \"We'll be the laughing-stock of the whole country!\" they said, \"if we  let him come home carrying the Nightingale Gisar! Let us take the bird  while he sleeps and hurry home with it. Then if he comes home later and  says it was he who really found the bird no one will believe him.\"    So they beat their brother into insensibility and tore his clothes to  rags to make him think that he had been set upon by robbers, and then  taking the golden cage and the Nightingale Gisar they hurried home and  presented themselves to their father, the Sultan.    \"Here, O father,\" they said, \"is the Nightingale Gisar! To get this  glorious bird for you we have endured all the perils in the world!\"    \"And your Youngest Brother,\" the Sultan asked, \"where is he?\"    \"The Youngest? Think no more of him, father, for he is unworthy to be  your son. Instead of searching the wide world for the Nightingale Gisar,  he settled down in the first city he reached and lived a life of  idleness and ease. Some say he became a barber and some say he opened a  coffee-house and spent his days chatting with passing travelers. He has  not come home with us for no doubt it shames him to know that we have  succeeded where he has failed.\"    The Sultan was grieved to hear this evil report of his Youngest Son, but  he was overjoyed to have the Nightingale Gisar. He had the golden cage  carried to the mosque and hung beside the fountain in the court.    But imagine his disappointment when the bird refused to sing!    \"Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque,\" the Dervish said  in his droning sing-song voice, \"and then the Nightingale will sing.\"    The Sultan immediately sent for his two sons. They came but still the  bird was silent.    \"See now,\" the Sultan said, \"my two sons are here and yet the bird is  silent.\"    But the Dervish would only repeat:    \"Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the  Nightingale will sing.\"    The next day a youth in rags whom nobody knew entered the mosque to pray  and instantly the Nightingale began to sing.    A messenger was sent running to the Sultan with the news that the  Nightingale was singing. The Sultan hurried to the mosque but by the  time he got there the beggar youth was gone and the Nightingale had  stopped singing.    \"Now that I'm here,\" cried the Sultan, \"why does the bird not sing?\"    The Dervish, swaying his body gently back and forth, made answer as  before:    \"Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the  Nightingale will sing.\"    Thereafter every day when the beggar youth came to the mosque to pray  the Nightingale sang, and always when the Sultan approached the beggar  walked away and the bird stopped singing. At last people began  whispering:    \"Strange that the Nightingale should sing only when that beggar youth is  near! And yet the Dervish says it will not sing unless he who found it  comes to the mosque! What can he mean?\"    Report of the beggar youth reached the ears of the Sultan and he went to  the Dervish and questioned him.    \"Why do you say that the Nightingale Gisar will not sing unless he who  found him comes to the mosque? Lo, here are my two sons who found him  and the bird remains silent, yet people tell me that when a certain  beggar comes to the mosque he sings. Why does he not sing when I and my  two sons come to pray?\"    And always the Dervish made the same answer in the same sing-song voice:    \"Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the  Nightingale will sing.\"    Soon a terrifying rumor spread through the land that a great Warrior  Princess called Flower o' the World was coming with a mighty army to  make war on the Sultan and to destroy his city. Her army far outnumbered  the Sultan's and when she encamped in a broad valley over against the  city the Sultan's people, seeing her mighty hosts, were filled with  dread and besought their ruler to make peace with the Princess at any  cost. So the Sultan called his heralds and sent them to her and through  them he said:    \"Demand of me what you will even to my life but spare my city.\"    The Warrior Princess returned this answer:    \"I will spare you and your city provided you deliver me your son who  stole from me the Nightingale Gisar. Him I shall have executed or let  live as it pleases me.\"    Now the Sultan's two sons knew that the Flower o' the World was fated to  marry the man who had stolen from her the Nightingale Gisar, so when  they heard the Princess's demand they were overjoyed thinking that she  would have to fall in love with one of them. So they disputed at great  length as to which of them had done the actual deed of taking the bird,  each insisting that it was he and not his brother. The Sultan himself  had finally to decide between them.    \"You have told me,\" he said, \"that you captured the bird together. As  that is the case and as I can't send you both to the Warrior Princess it  is only right that the older should go.\"    So under a splendid escort the oldest son rode to the tent of the  Warrior Princess. She bade him enter alone and when he appeared before  her she looked at him long and steadily. Then she said:    \"Nay, but you are never the man who stole from me the Nightingale Gisar!  You would lack the courage to face the perils of the way!\"    The oldest prince answered the Flower o' the World craftily:    \"But how, Princess, if I did not steal from you the Nightingale Gisar  was I then able to bring back that glorious bird and hang his cage  beside the fountain in the mosque?\"    But Flower o' the World was not to be deceived by such specious words.    \"Tell me then,\" she said, \"if it was you who stole my glorious  Nightingale, where did you find him hanging in his golden cage?\"    The oldest prince could not answer this, so he said at random:    \"I found his golden cage hanging in the cypress tree that grows in the  garden of your palace.\"    \"Enough!\" cried the Princess.    She clapped her hands and when her guards appeared she said to them:    \"Have this man executed at once and let his head be sent to the Sultan  with the message: _This is the head of a liar and a coward! Send me at  once your son who stole my glorious Nightingale Gisar or I will march  against your city!_\"    The Sultan was greatly shocked to receive this message together with the  head of his oldest son.    \"Alas!\" he cried, calling his second son, \"would that I had listened to  you when you insisted that it was you and not your brother who actually  did the deed! Unhappily I listened to your brother! See now the awful  result of this mistake! Go you now to this heartless Princess whom men  call Flower o' the World or else our poor defenseless city will have to  pay the penalty.\"    So the second prince was taken to the tent of the Warrior Maiden and she  put to him the same questions and he fared even worse than his brother  had fared. So his head, too, was sent to the Sultan with this message:    \"_Send me no more liars and cowards but the son who actually did steal  from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar._\"    In despair the Sultan went to the mosque to pray. As he bowed his head  he heard the Nightingale burst forth in song. Then when he looked up he  saw a beggar youth standing near the fountain.

It was indeed an unheard-of proceeding, and a most mistaken  one, for the greater part of the Saxons seized opportunities to  desert, as soon as the next campaign began. It was the more  ill-advised, since Saxony was a Protestant country, and therefore  the action alienated the other Protestant princes in Germany, whose  sympathies would have otherwise been wholly with Prussia; and it  was to no small extent due to that high-handed action that, during  the winter, the Swedes joined the Confederacy, and undertook to  supply an army of 50,000 men; France paying a subsidy towards their  maintenance, and the members of the Confederacy agreeing that, upon  the division of Prussia, Pomerania should fall to the share of  Sweden. Thus it may be said that the whole of Central and Northern  Europe, with the exception only of Hanover, was leagued against  Prussia.    It was a result of this general outburst of indignation that,  instead of being kept in a large town and allowed various  privileges, the prisoners taken at the battle of Lobositz were  treated with exceptional severity, and confined in isolated  fortresses. Fergus and his companion were lodged in a small room in  one of the towers. The window was strongly barred, the floor was of  stone, the door massive and studded with iron. Two truckle beds, a  table, and two chairs formed the sole furniture.    \"Not much chance of an escape here,\" Captain Hindeman said, as the  door closed behind their guards.    \"The prospect does not look very bright, I admit,\" Fergus said  cheerfully; \"but we have a proverb, 'Where there is a will there is  a way'. I have the will certainly and, as we have plenty of time  before us, it will be hard if we do not find a way.\"    He went to the window and looked out.    \"Over a hundred feet,\" he said, \"and I should say a precipice fully  as deep at the foot of the wall. At any rate, we have the advantage  of an extensive view.    \"I am glad to see that there is a fireplace, for the cold will be  bitter here, when the winter sets in. I wonder whether the rooms  above and below this are tenanted?\"    Hindeman shrugged his shoulders. He was not, at present, in a mood  to take interest in anything. It was now the end of October, and  Fergus was very glad when the door opened again, and a warder came  in with two soldiers, who carried huge baskets of firewood; and it  was not long before a large fire was blazing on the hearth.    Day after day passed. Fergus turned over in his mind every possible  method of escape, but the prospect looked very dark. Even if the  door were open, there would be difficulties of all sorts to  encounter. In the middle of the day many people went in and out of  the fortress, with provisions, wood, and other matters; but at  sunset the gates were shut, and sentries placed on the walls; and  on getting out he would have to cross an inner courtyard, and then  pass through a gateway--at which a sentinel was posted night and  day--into the outer court, which was surrounded by a strong wall  over thirty feet high, with towers at the angles.    Escape from the window would be equally difficult. Two long and  very strong ropes would be required, and the bars of the window  were so massive that, without tools of any kind, it would be  impossible to remove them.    A month later Captain Hindeman fell ill, and was removed to the  infirmary. Fergus was glad of his departure. He had been so  depressed that he was useless as a companion and, so long as he  remained there, he altogether prevented any plan of escape being  attempted; for difficult as it might be for one person to get away,  it would be next to impossible for two to do so.    For an hour in the day, the prisoners had leave to walk on the  wall. His fellow prisoner had never availed himself of this  privilege; but Fergus always took his daily exercise, partly to  keep himself in health, partly in hopes that a plan of escape might  present itself. A sentry, however, was always posted on the wall  while the prisoners were at exercise; and on the side allotted for  their walk, the rock sloped away steeply from the foot of the wall.  The thought of escape, therefore, in broad daylight was out of the  question; and Fergus generally watched what was going on in the  courtyard.    In time he came to know which was the entrance to the apartments of  the governor and his family, where the married officers were  quartered, and where the soldiers lodged. He saw that on the ground  floor of the tower he occupied were the quarters of a field officer  belonging to the garrison.    One day he saw a number of men employed in clearing out some unused  quarters, on one side of the outer courtyard, and judged that an  addition was about to be made to the garrison. This gave substance  to a plan that he had been revolving in his mind. That evening,  when the warder brought him his food, he said carelessly:    \"I see you have some more troops coming in.\"    \"Yes,\" the man replied, \"there are three hundred more men coming.  They will march in tomorrow afternoon. They will be getting the  room on the first floor, below here, cleared out tomorrow morning  for the officer who commands them.\"    Fergus had, all along, considered that there would be no difficulty  in suddenly attacking and overpowering the warder, when he came in  or out of his room, for no special precautions were taken. The fact  that the prisoners were all in their uniforms, and that on showing  themselves below they would be instantly arrested, seemed to forbid  all chance of their making any attempt to escape. It was the matter  of clothes that had, more than anything else, puzzled Fergus; for  although he thought that he might possibly obtain a uniform from  some officer's quarters, it was evident that the guard would at  once perceive that he was not one of the officers of the garrison.  The arrival of the fresh detachment relieved him of this  difficulty, and it now seemed that a way of escape was open to him.    Much depended upon the hour at which the regiment would arrive. The  later they did so the better, and as the weather had for some days  been terribly rough, and the roads would be deep and heavy, it was  likely that they would not arrive until some time past the hour  fixed.    The next afternoon he listened for the roll of drums that would  greet the arrival of the newcomers. Just as the door opened, and  the sergeant entered with a lantern, he heard the sound that he had  been listening for.      [Illustration: As the man was placing his supper on the table,  Fergus sprang upon him]      Nothing could have happened more fortunately. As the man was  placing his supper on the table, Fergus sprang suddenly upon him,  hurled him down on to his face, and then fastened his hands behind  him with a rope he had made from twisted strips of one of his rugs.  He was not afraid of his calling out, as the window looked outside,  and it was blowing half a gale. Moreover, the sound of drums below  would aid to prevent any noise being heard from the courtyard.    \"I don't want to hurt you, sergeant,\" he said, \"but I do want my  liberty. I must put a bandage round your mouth, to prevent you from  calling; but you know as well as I do that there would be no chance  of your being heard, however loud you might shout.    \"Now, in the first place I am going to see if I can get a uniform.  If I cannot, I must come back and take yours.\"    Binding the sergeant's legs as well as his arms, and putting a  muffler over his mouth, Fergus went out, leaving his own jacket and  cap behind him. The key was in the door. He turned it and put it in  his pocket, shot the heavy bolts, and ran downstairs. When he got  to the bottom, he tried the door of the major's quarters. It was  unbolted, and he felt absolutely certain that the major would be  out as, with the other officers, he would have gone down to the  gate to receive those of the incoming detachment.    On opening the door, he saw the articles of which he was in  search--a long cloak and a regimental cap. These he at once put on.  After a further search, he found a pair of military pantaloons and  a patrol jacket. Throwing off the cloak, he rapidly changed his  clothes. He wanted now only a regimental sword to complete the  costume, but he trusted to the long cloak to hide the absence of  this.    Throwing the things that he had taken off under the bed, he went  out, closed the door behind him, locked it, and took the key. He  had with him the short sword carried by the warder, and he relied  upon this to silence the sentry, at the passage leading to the  outer court, should he attempt to stop him.    This, however, was most unlikely. The night was dark, and there was  no light burning; and at this hour, with fresh troops arriving and  a general movement in the fortress, there could be no question of a  countersign being demanded by a sentry in the interior of the  place. The man, indeed, only drew himself up and saluted, as he  dimly made out an officer coming from the major's quarters.    The courtyard beyond was half full of soldiers. The newcomers had  just fallen out. Some were being greeted by members of the garrison  who had known them before, officers were chatting together; and  Fergus made his way, unnoticed in the darkness, to the gate. As he  had hoped, the baggage waggons were making their way in.    A sentry was placed on each side of the gate.    \"Now then,\" he said sharply, \"hurry on with these waggons. The  commandant wants the gate shut, as soon as possible;\" and passing  the sentry, he went on as if to hurry up the rear of the train.    Taking him for one of the officers of the newly-arrived party, the  sentry stepped back at once, and he passed out.    There were six waggons still outside and, unnoticed, he passed  these and went down the road. He had brought with him under his  cloak the sergeant's lantern and, as soon as he"]]]
