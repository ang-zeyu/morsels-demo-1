Fat in any shape or form will  attract the various species of titmice to the window. I always keep a  small Normandy basket full of suet and ham-fat hanging on a nail at the  window. It is a great rendezvous for these charming little pets, and it  is also supplied with Barcelona nuts for nuthatches, who fully  appreciate them and carry them off to the nearest tree with rugged bark  into which they fix the nuts, and then hammer at the shell till they can  extract the contents.    In very hard frosts I used always to put out a pan of water, as I feared  the birds suffered from thirst and needed this help. One day, however, I  was comforted to see some starlings, after a good meal of groats, run  off to the grass plot and eagerly peck at the hoar-frost, which, while  it exists, thus supplies the lack of water.    Bewick says linnets are so named from their fondness for linseed, and I  think most of the finches like it. The greenfinch is soon attracted by  hemp seed, and all the smaller birds by canary seed. I hope this paper  may induce many kind hands to minister to the needs of our feathered  friends during the winter months. It is sad to think of their dying for  lack of the food we can so easily afford them, and they will be sure to  repay us by their sweet songs and confiding tameness when summer days  return.    One is apt to think that winter is the only time when birds need our  help and bounty, but there is almost as much real distress after a long  drought in summer, especially amongst the insect-eating birds.    I was led to think of this by the pathetic way in which a hen blackbird  came to the French window of my room early in June last and stood  patiently waiting and clicking time after time in trouble of _some_ kind  I knew, and, supposing it might be food, I threw out a plentiful supply  of soaked brown bread. At once the poor bird went to it, devouring  ravenously for her own needs, and then, filling her beak as full as it  would hold, she flew off with a supply for her young brood. Then came  thrushes, robins, sparrows, a whole bevy of feathered folk all doing the  same thing--carrying the provisions in every direction for unseen  families at starvation point, and I began to realize that the month of  continued sunshine in which we had rejoiced had brought great distress  upon the birds by drying up the lawns so that no worms could be found,  and, as it was early in the year, but few insects were to be had, so  that just when each pair of birds had a clamorous brood to provide for  the food supply had fallen short. Now I understood the pathos of the hen  blackbird's appeal; her dark eyes and note of distress were trying to  say to me, \"I know you care for us; you seemed so kind last winter; when  we were without food you fed us and saved our lives; but now I am in far  deeper distress--my children are crying for food, the grass is dried up,  and the ground so hard that I cannot find a single worm, I am thin and  worn with hunger myself; do help me and my little ones, and we will sing  you sweet songs in return to cheer you when wintry days come back again.  Does she understand? I've said all this several times before, but I  thought I would make one last appeal before my children die. Yes; she  has left the room! I will wait. Ah! here it is, just the soft food that  will suit my little ones: how they _will_ rejoice and all want to be  fed at once. I hope my friend can understand that I am thanking her with  all my heart.\" Love has a universal language and can interpret through  varied signs, and thus I quite believe the mother bird's heart wished to  express itself.    Ever since that day I have been careful in nesting time to supply  suitable and varied food for the families of young birds in times of  drought, for it seems mournful to think of their dying from want, in the  season of flowers and green leaves, when nature is to us so attractive,  and rendered all the more so by their sweet songs.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    RAB, MINOR.      This familiar name recalls the delightful story of \"Rab and his Friends\"  in \"Horae Subsicivae,\" with its naive description of a very original  \"tyke\" of a doggie--a biography which had so lived in my recollection  that when a queer little fluffy dumpling of a puppy was given me I could  not help giving it the old familiar name, little knowing how aptly true  the name would prove to be in after years.    Is there anything more comical than a young Scotch terrier puppy, with  its preternatural gravity, its queer, ungainly attempts at play, its  tumbles, and blue-eyed simplicity, and, best of all, its sage look, with  head on one side, trying to consider the merits of some doggie idea  which is puzzling his infant brain? Rab went through all the stages of  puppyhood, showing the usual amount of mischief and fun; he might be met  carrying about some unfortunate slipper frayed to pieces by his busy  teeth, or burying a favourite bone under a wool mat in the drawing-room,  or, worse still, it is recorded in domestic chronicles that he buried a  hymn-book in the garden, whereupon the cook remarked that she believed  he had more religion in him than half the Christians; but that reasoning  was not apparent to any one but herself.    Rab's most notable adventures took place after he had emerged from  puppyhood. He had a most indomitable spirit of disobedience; he would  hunt rabbits or anything else he could find in the woods, and one day he  reached home with a snare tightly drawn round his neck, and panting  distressingly for breath; the wire was cut only just in time to save  his life.    Another time he was poisoned by something he had eaten, and had a long  suffering illness.    His fights with other dogs were fierce and frequent, and whilst engaged  in a scrimmage with a hated rival, Rab was run over by a passing cart,  and limped home in a very dejected state; no bones were broken, but he  was an invalid for some months in consequence.    At last it was thought needful to tie him up, and he had his appointed  house and a long chain, and with frequent exercise he became quite  content. One morning our brave little friend was found nearly dead, with  two terrible wounds in his neck, which must have been made by a sharp  knife, driven twice through his throat, but, strangely enough, had each  time just missed severing the wind-pipe. He had nearly died from loss of  blood, and was scarcely able to breathe; still, our kind servants did  not give him up; warm milk and beef tea were given him constantly  through the day; and by night he had revived a little, and was evidently  going to live. We could never trace the origin of this outrage, and  could only suppose that burglars had purposed breaking into our house,  and, enraged at Rab's barking, had at last got hold of, and, as they  thought, killed him, and flung the body into an adjoining field. Poor  little doggie! he suffered grievously for his brave defence, and for  months the wounds were a great distress to him and to us; but all that  loving care could do was done, and once more his wonderful constitution  enabled him to regain health and strength. We kept at that time several  very large mastiffs, and the next adventure occurred early one morning,  when we were aroused by a terrific noise in the stable-yard, and the  message brought to us was to the effect that Rab was quite dead. He had  been worried by one of the mastiffs which had got loose in the night. I  rose quickly and went to see the poor little victim's body, and looking  at it, I saw a little quiver in the eyelid that led to a gleam of hope.  I had him carried indoors, and again teaspoons of milk, &c., were given,  and actually he began to revive, and a feeble wag of his tail, seemed to  say, \"I'm very bad, but not dead yet.\" The sad part was that the shaking  and worrying he had received had reopened the previous wounds, and  though after a time he was able to get about, he was quite a wreck; one  ear was gone, and the other, strange to say, was but a fragment, like  his namesake in \"Rab and his Friends.\" Still, he lived to be nearly  fifteen, and then rheumatism and loss of teeth made his life a distress  to him, and he was peacefully dismissed to the rest he had bravely  earned by his life of courageous devotion to what he thought the path of  duty.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    A VISIT TO JAMRACH.      There is an old and true saying--\"Everything comes to him who waits.\" I  thought of this saying while on my way to visit the well-known place  near the London Docks where Mr. Jamrach is supposed to keep almost every  rare animal, bird, and reptile, ready to supply the wants of all  customers at a moment's notice. For many long years I had wished to pay  him a visit, but ill-health and other causes had proved a hindrance and  I could hardly believe my wish was going to be realized when I found  myself on the way to his menagerie. After driving through a labyrinth of  narrow, dirty streets, we were at last obliged to get out and walk till  we came to the shop, and then we did indeed find ourselves in the midst  of \"animated nature.\" We had landed amongst the cockatoos, macaws, and  parrots, and they greeted our arrival with such a chorus of shrieks,  screams, and hideous cries that my first desire was to rush away  anywhere out of the reach of such ear-piercing sounds. One had to bear  it, however, if the curious creatures in the various cages were to be  examined, and after a time the uproar grew less, and I could hear a word  or two from Mr. Jamrach, who called my attention to some armadillos,  huge armour-plated animals, very curious, but somehow not attractive as  pets; one could not fondle a thing composed of metal plates, shaped like  a pig, with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#19)"],[1,"these things fasten with springs instead of  straps,\" he observed, by way of genial conversation.    Oh, how we chafed and fumed!    \"_Will_ you look sharp, if you're going to play at all?\" howls our  captain.    \"All _right_, old chap; I can't be quicker than I am; where are the  gloves?\"    The gloves are brought like lightning, but not like lightning put on.  No, the india-rubber gauntlets must needs be drawn with the greatest  care and deliberation over his fingers, and even then require a good  deal of shifting to render them comfortable.  Then he was actually (I  believe) going to take them off in order to roll up his shirt sleeves,  had not two of us performed that office for him with a rapidity which  astonished him.    \"Upon my word, this is too bad,\" says our captain, flinging down the bat  he was holding, and stamping with vexation.  \"We might as well give the  whole thing up!\"    \"I'm awfully sorry,\" drawled Ned, in an injured tone; \"but how could I  help it?  I'm ready now.\"    \"Ready!  I should hope you were.  Off you cut now; it only wants five  minutes to the time.\"    He starts to go, but turns before he has well left us, and says--    \"Oh, I say, Jim, lend us your bat, will you?  This one is sprung, and  one of the--\"    \"Here you are,\" we shout, running to him with a dozen bats at  once--\"only look sharp.\"    \"I only want one,\" he says.  \"Let me see this; no, this will do.  Thanks, old man,\" and off he saunters again.    The other side is lying comfortably on the grass, very well satisfied at  the delay which every moment adds to their chance of victory.  What  centuries Ned appears to be taking in strolling up to the wickets!    \"I wish I was behind him with a red-hot poker,\" says one; \"I'd make him  trot!\"    \"Not a bit of it,\" growls our captain; \"Ned would want more than that to  start him.\"    Look at him now, getting \"middle\" as if he'd the whole afternoon before  him!  And that done, he slowly and deliberately taps the end of his bat  on the place till we almost yell with rage.    \"It's no use now!\" groans our captain in absolute despair; and so,  indeed, we and our smiling adversaries all thought.    \"Play!\" cries the bowler.    \"Wait a bit,\" says the aggravating Ned, dipping his hands in the  sawdust! \"now!\"    The ball comes at last, and Ned lets fly.  It is a grand hit; the ball  comes whizzing right past where we stand, and with delight as great as  our previous agony we cheer till we are hoarse.    Three runs are added to our score, and now we only want one more to  equal our opponents, and two to win; but we shall never do it in the  time, unless fortune favours us strangely.  For see, it is \"over,\" and  the fielders will consume half of the remaining two minutes in changing  their position.    Then again \"play\" is called.    Would you believe it?  Ned calls out for \"middle\" again at the new  wicket, and repeats the same pottering operation when he has got it.  \"Well, if ever _I_ saw--\"    What our captain is about to say no one ever hears, for at that moment  the ball is delivered, and Ned blocks it dead.    There is just time for one ball more, and on that all our hopes depend.    It comes, and Ned bangs at it!  It's a run!  No, it isn't! yes it is!  The fielder has missed it.  Hurrah! we are equal!    Actually they are running another!  They won't do it.  Up comes the ball  to the wicket-keeper, and forward darts Ned's bat over the crease.    \"How's that, umpire?\" cries the wicket-keeper.    \"Not out!\"    \"Time's up!\"    Oh, how we cheer!  How we rush forward and shoulder Ned home to the  tent.  Never was such a close shave of a match!    Ned himself by no means shares in the general excitement.    \"Why, what a hurry you fellows were in!\" he says.  \"Look here, George,  I'll show you now what I meant about the springs on the pads.\"    Now you will understand what a very aggravating fellow this Ned Easy  was; and yet he generally managed to come off best in the end.  He  generally managed to scrape in at the finish of whatever he undertook.    I am certain that if he were a prisoner of war _let_ out on parole, with  a pledge to return in one hour or suffer death, he would turn up cool  and comfortable on the sixtieth tick of the sixtieth minute of that  hour, and look quite surprised at the men who were loading their muskets  for his execution.    But some day the chances are he will be late in earnest, and then he  will have to repent in a hurry of his bad speed.    A fellow who is easy-going about his time is generally easy-going about  his friends, his money, and his morals.    Not that Ned is the sort of fellow to turn out a rascal exactly.  He has  not the energy, even if he had the inclination.  A rascal, to be at all  successful, must be brisk, and an observer of times and seasons, and  that is altogether out of Ned's line.  No; he'll be careless about what  he does, and about what people think of him; he will lend a sovereign  with as little idea of getting it back as he has of returning the pound  he himself had borrowed; he will think nothing of keeping a friend  waiting half a day; neither will he take offence if his own good nature  is drawn on to an unlimited extent.    He is, after his fashion, an observer of the golden rule, for although  he is constantly annoying and exasperating people by his easy-going  ways, he is never afflicted if others do _to him_ as he does to them.  He goes through life with the notion that every one is as complaisant  and comfortable as himself.  \"Easy-going-ness\" (if one may coin a word  for the occasion) is, many people would say, a combination of  selfishness and stupidity, but I think such people judge rather too  hardly of Ned and his compeers.  It's all very well for some of us, who  perhaps are of an active turn of mind, to talk about curing oneself of  this fault; but perhaps, if we knew all, we should find that it would be  about as easy as for a fair-complexioned person to make himself dark.  Ned's disposition is due more to his constitution than his upbringing,  and those who are blindly intolerant of his ways do him a wrong.  I'm  sure he himself wishes he were as smart as some boys he sees, but he  can't be, and you might just as well try to lash an elephant into a  gallop as Ned into a flurry.    It is generally found that what he does he does well, which in a measure  makes up for the length of time he takes in doing it; he is good-  natured, brave, harmless, and cheery, and has lots of friends, whom he  allows full liberty both to abuse and laugh at him (and what can friends  want more?) and for the rest, he's neither vicious nor an idiot; and if  nobody were worse than he is, the world would perhaps be rather better  than it is.    An artificial \"easy-going-ness\" is undoubtedly a vice.  It's a forgery,  however, easily detected, and generally brings its own punishment.  I  advise none of my readers to try it on.  If they are naturally energetic  and smart, they have a much better chance of rising in the world than  Ned has; but let them, when they laugh at Ned and abuse him, remember  the fable of the hare and the tortoise.    I must just tell one more story of Ned in conclusion.    One night our whole school was startled by an alarm of \"Fire!\"  We  sprang from our beds, and, without waiting to dress, rushed to the  quarter from which the cry had proceeded.  It was only too true; a barn  at one end of the buildings was in flames, and there seemed every  prospect of the school itself catching fire.    We hurried back in a panic towards the staircase leading to the front  door, and in doing so discovered Ned was not with us.    One of us darted off to the dormitory, where he lay in bed sound asleep.    A rough shake roused him.    \"What's the row?\" he drawled, stretching himself.    \"Get up quick, Ned; there's a fire!\"    \"Where?\" asked Ned, without stirring.    \"In the doctor's wing.\"    The doctor's wing was that farthest removed from our dormitories.    Ned yawned.    \"Then it couldn't possibly reach here for half an hour.  Call us again  in twenty minutes, Ben, there's a good fellow!\"        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    THE BOY WHO IS \"NEVER WRONG.\"    One might fancy at the first blush, that such a boy is one to be envied,  admired, and caressed above all others.  Never wrong!  What would not  some of us give to have the same said of us?  Aren't _we_ always  blundering and losing our way and making asses of ourselves every day of  our lives?  What wonder then if to us a being who is \"never wrong\"  should appear almost superhuman in his glory?    But, so far from being the noble, delightful creature one would expect,  the boy I am speaking of is an odious fellow, and as ridiculous as he is  odious, and I will tell you why.    The principal reason is, because he requires us to believe, on his own  unaided testimony, that he is the infallible being he professes to be;  and the second and hardly less important reason is, that, so far from  being always right, he is as often, if not oftener, wrong than other  people; in short, he's a hum!    \"Never wrong,\" indeed!  If all the British Association were to declare  as much of any one man, we should hardly be inclined to swallow it; but  when our sole authority in the matter is Master Timothy Told-you-so  himself, it becomes a joke, and a very poor joke too.    Let us just take stock of Timothy for a minute or two, to explain what  we mean.    He's in class, and the lesson is history.  He does not look happy, but  of course that can't be because he doesn't know the lesson.  Timothy not  know a lesson indeed!    \"Timothy,\" says the master, \"tell me in whose reign the Reformation was  introduced into England, will you?\"    \"James the First,\" replies Timothy.    \"Next boy?\"    \"Henry the Eighth.\"    \"Right; go up.\"    \"Oh, sir,\" says Timothy, \"that's what I meant; _I mistook the name_ for  a moment!\"  And he goes down with the air of an injured and resigned  boy.
