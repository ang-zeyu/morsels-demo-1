The  moon must give not according to her abundance, but in the inverse  ratio thereof--because she has little she must give largely. Nor shall  we make an erroneous estimate if we say that nine-tenths of the whole  moment of momentum necessary for the enlargement of the orbit would  have been exacted from the moon; that means that the moon must once  have had about five or six times as much moment of momentum as the  earth possesses at this moment. Considering the small size of the  moon, this could only have arisen by terrific velocity of rotation,  which it is inconceivable that its materials could ever have  possessed.    This presents the demonstration of tidal evolution in a fresh light.  If the moon now departed to any considerable extent from showing the  constant face to the earth, it would seem that its retreat could not  have been caused by tides. Some other agent for producing the present  configuration would be necessary, just as we found that some other  agent than the tides has been necessary in the case of Jupiter.    But I must say a few words as to the attitude of this question with  regard to the entire solar system. This system consists of the sun  presiding at the centre, and of the planets and their satellites in  revolution around their respective primaries, and each also animated  by a rotation on its axis. I shall in so far depart from the actual  configuration of the system as to transform it into an ideal system,  whereof the masses, the dimensions, and the velocities shall all be  preserved; but that the several planes of revolution shall be all  flattened into one plane, instead of being inclined at small angles as  they are at present; nor will it be unreasonable for us at the same  time to bring into parallelism all the axes of rotation, and to  arrange that their common directions shall be perpendicular to the  plane of their common orbits. For the purpose of our present research  this ideal system may pass for the real system.    In its original state, whatever that state may have been, a  magnificent endowment was conferred upon the system. Perhaps I may,  without derogation from the dignity of my subject, speak of the  endowment as partly personal and partly entailed. The system had of  course different powers with regard to the disposal of the two  portions; the personal estate could be squandered. It consisted  entirely of what we call energy; and considering how frequently we use  the expression conservation of energy, it may seem strange to say now  that this portion of the endowment has been found capable of  alienation, nay, further, that our system has been squandering it  persistently from the first moment until now. Although the doctrine of  the conservation of energy is, we have every reason to believe, a  fundamental law affecting the whole universe, yet it would be wholly  inaccurate to say that any particular system such as our solar system  shall invariably preserve precisely the same quantity of energy  without alteration. The circumstance that heat is a form of energy  indeed negatives this supposition. For our system possesses energy of  all the different kinds: there is energy due to the motions both of  rotation and of revolution; there is energy due to the fact that the  mutually attracting bodies of our system are separated by distances of  enormous magnitude; and there is also energy in the form of heat; and  the laws of heat permit that this form of energy shall be radiated off  into space, and thus disappear entirely, in so far as our system is  concerned. On the other hand, there may no doubt be some small amount  of energy accruing to our system from the other systems in space,  which like ours are radiating forth energy. Any gain from this source,  however, is necessarily so very small in comparison to the loss to  which we have referred, that it is quite impossible that the one  should balance the other. Though it is undoubtedly true that the  total quantity of energy in the universe is constant, yet the share of  that energy belonging to any particular system such as ours declines  steadily from age to age.    I may indeed remark, that the question as to what becomes of all the  radiant energy which the millions of suns in the universe are daily  discharging offers a problem apparently not easy to solve; but we need  not discuss the matter at present, we are only going to trace out the  vicissitudes of our own system; and whatever other changes that system  may exhibit, the fact is certain that the total quantity of energy it  contains is declining.    Of the two endowments of energy and of moment of momentum originally  conferred on our system the moment of momentum is the entailed estate.  No matter how the bodies may move, no matter how their actions may  interfere with one another, no matter how this body is pulled one way  and the other body that way, the conservation of moment of momentum is  not imperilled, nor, no matter what losses of heat may be experienced  by radiation, could the store of moment of momentum be affected. The  only conceivable way in which the quantity of moment of momentum in  the solar system could be tampered with is by the interference of some  external attracting body. We know, however, that the stars are all  situated at such enormous distances, that the influences they can  exert in the perturbation of the solar system are absolutely  insensible; they are beyond the reach of the most delicate  astronomical measurements. Hence we see how the endowment of the  system with moment of momentum has conferred upon that system a  something which is absolutely inalienable, even to the smallest  portion.    Before going any further it would be necessary for me to explain more  fully than I have hitherto done the true nature of the method of  estimating moment of momentum. The moment of momentum consists of two  parts: there is first that due to the revolution of the bodies around  the sun; there is secondly the rotation of these bodies on their axes.  Let us first think simply of a single planet revolving in a circular  orbit around the sun. The momentum of that planet at any moment may be  regarded as the product of its mass and its velocity; then the moment  of momentum of the planet in the case mentioned is found by  multiplying the momentum by the radius of the path pursued. In a more  general case, where the planet does not revolve in a circle, but  pursued an elliptic path, the moment of momentum is to be found by  multiplying the planet's velocity and its mass into the perpendicular  from the sun on the direction in which the planet is moving.    These rules provide the methods for estimating all the moments of  momentum, so far as the revolutions in our system are concerned. For  the rotations somewhat more elaborate processes are required. Let us  think of a sphere rotating round a fixed axis. Every particle of that  sphere will of course describe a circle around the axis, and all these  circles will lie in parallel planes. We may for our present purpose  regard each atom of the body as a little planet revolving in a  circular orbit, and therefore the moment of momentum of the entire  sphere will be found by simply adding together the moments of momentum  of all the different atoms of which the sphere is composed. To perform  this addition the use of an elaborate mathematical method is required.  I do not propose to enter into the matter any further, except to say  that the total moment of momentum is the product of two factors--one  the angular velocity with which the sphere is turning round, while the  other involves the sphere's mass and dimensions.    To illustrate the principles of the computation we shall take one or  two examples. Suppose that two circles be drawn, one of which is  double the diameter of the other. Let two planets be taken of equal  mass, and one of these be put to revolve in one circle, and the other  to revolve in the other circle, in such a way that the periods of both  revolutions shall be equal. It is required to find the moments of  momentum in the two cases. In the larger of the two circles it is  plain that the planet must be moving twice as rapidly as in the  smaller, therefore its momentum is twice as great; and as the radius  is also double, it follows that the moment of momentum in the large  orbit will be four times that in the small orbit. We thus see that the  moment of momentum increases in the proportion of the squares of the  radii. If, however, the two planets were revolving about the same sun,  one of these orbits being double the other, the periodic times could  not be equal, for Kepler's law tells us that the square of the  periodic time is proportional to the cube of the mean distance.  Suppose, then, that the distance of the first planet is 1, and that of  the second planet is 2, the cubes of those numbers are 1 and 8, and  therefore the periodic times of the two bodies will be as 1 to the  square root of 8. We can thus see that the velocity of the outer body  must be less than that of the inner one, for while the length of the  path is only double as large, the time taken to describe that path is  the square root of eight times as great; in fact, the velocity of the  outer body will be only the square root of twice that of the inner  one. As, however, its distance from the sun is twice as great, it  follows that the moment of momentum of the outer body will be the  square root of twice that of the inner body. We may state this result  a little more generally as follows--    In comparing the moments of momentum of the several planets which  revolve around the sun, that of each planet is proportional to the  product of its mass with the square root of its distance from the  sun.
