A troop of armed peasants was  seen approaching, and every one exclaimed that the criminal had been  apprehended. Werther looked, and was not long in doubt. The prisoner  was no other than the servant, who had been formerly so attached to the  widow, and whom he had met prowling about, with that suppressed anger  and ill-concealed despair, which we have before described.    \"What have you done, unfortunate man?\" inquired Werther, as he advanced  toward the prisoner. The latter turned his eyes upon him in silence, and  then replied with perfect composure; \"No one will now marry her, and  she will marry no one.\" The prisoner was taken into the inn, and Werther  left the place. The mind of Werther was fearfully excited by this  shocking occurrence. He ceased, however, to be oppressed by his usual  feeling of melancholy, moroseness, and indifference to everything  that passed around him. He entertained a strong degree of pity for the  prisoner, and was seized with an indescribable anxiety to save him from  his impending fate. He considered him so unfortunate, he deemed his  crime so excusable, and thought his own condition so nearly similar,  that he felt convinced he could make every one else view the matter in  the light in which he saw it himself. He now became anxious to undertake  his defence, and commenced composing an eloquent speech for the  occasion; and, on his way to the hunting-lodge, he could not refrain  from speaking aloud the statement which he resolved to make to the  judge.    Upon his arrival, he found Albert had been before him: and he was a  little perplexed by this meeting; but he soon recovered himself, and  expressed his opinion with much warmth to the judge. The latter shook,  his head doubtingly; and although Werther urged his case with the utmost  zeal, feeling, and determination in defence of his client, yet, as we  may easily suppose, the judge was not much influenced by his appeal.  On the contrary, he interrupted him in his address, reasoned with  him seriously, and even administered a rebuke to him for becoming  the advocate of a murderer. He demonstrated, that, according to this  precedent, every law might be violated, and the public security utterly  destroyed. He added, moreover, that in such a case he could himself do  nothing, without incurring the greatest responsibility; that everything  must follow in the usual course, and pursue the ordinary channel.    Werther, however, did not abandon his enterprise, and even besought the  judge to connive at the flight of the prisoner. But this proposal  was peremptorily rejected. Albert, who had taken some part in the  discussion, coincided in opinion with the judge. At this Werther became  enraged, and took his leave in great anger, after the judge had more  than once assured him that the prisoner could not be saved.    The excess of his grief at this assurance may be inferred from a note we  have found amongst his papers, and which was doubtless written upon this  very occasion.    \"You cannot be saved, unfortunate man! I see clearly that we cannot be  saved!\"    Werther was highly incensed at the observations which Albert had made  to the judge in this matter of the prisoner. He thought he could detect  therein a little bitterness toward himself personally; and although,  upon reflection, it could not escape his sound judgment that their view  of the matter was correct, he felt the greatest possible reluctance to  make such an admission.    A memorandum of Werther's upon this point, expressive of his general  feelings toward Albert, has been found amongst his papers.    \"What is the use of my continually repeating that he is a good and  estimable man? He is an inward torment to me, and I am incapable of  being just toward him.\"    One fine evening in winter, when the weather seemed inclined to thaw,  Charlotte and Albert were returning home together. The former looked  from time to time about her, as if she missed Werther's company. Albert  began to speak of him, and censured him for his prejudices. He  alluded to his unfortunate attachment, and wished it were possible  to discontinue his acquaintance. \"I desire it on our own account,\" he  added; \"and I request you will compel him to alter his deportment toward  you, and to visit you less frequently. The world is censorious, and I  know that here and there we are spoken of.\" Charlotte made no reply,  and Albert seemed to feel her silence. At least, from that time he never  again spoke of Werther; and, when she introduced the subject, he allowed  the conversation to die away, or else he directed the discourse into  another channel.    The vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer was the  last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished. He sank  almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom and inactivity, until  he was at length brought to perfect distraction by learning that he  was to be summoned as a witness against the prisoner, who asserted his  complete innocence.    His mind now became oppressed by the recollection of every misfortune  of his past life. The mortification he had suffered at the ambassador's,  and his subsequent troubles, were revived in his memory. He became  utterly inactive. Destitute of energy, he was cut off from every pursuit  and occupation which compose the business of common life; and he became  a victim to his own susceptibility, and to his restless passion for the  most amiable and beloved of women, whose peace he destroyed. In this  unvarying monotony of existence his days were consumed; and his powers  became exhausted without aim or design, until they brought him to a  sorrowful end.    A few letters which he left behind, and which we here subjoin, afford  the best proofs of his anxiety of mind and of the depth of his passion,  as well as of his doubts and struggles, and of his weariness of life.    DECEMBER 12.    Dear Wilhelm, I am reduced to the condition of those unfortunate  wretches who believe they are pursued by an evil spirit. Sometimes I am  oppressed, not by apprehension or fear, but by an inexpressible internal  sensation, which weighs upon my heart, and impedes my breath! Then  I wander forth at night, even in this tempestuous season, and feel  pleasure in surveying the dreadful scenes around me.    Yesterday evening I went forth. A rapid thaw had suddenly set in: I  had been informed that the river had risen, that the brooks had all  overflowed their banks, and that the whole vale of Walheim was under  water! Upon the stroke of twelve I hastened forth. I beheld a  fearful sight. The foaming torrents rolled from the mountains in the  moonlight,--fields and meadows, trees and hedges, were confounded  together; and the entire valley was converted into a deep lake, which  was agitated by the roaring wind! And when the moon shone forth, and  tinged the black clouds with silver, and the impetuous torrent at  my feet foamed and resounded with awful and grand impetuosity, I was  overcome by a mingled sensation of apprehension and delight. With  extended arms I looked down into the yawning abyss, and cried,  \"Plunge!'\" For a moment my senses forsook me, in the intense delight of  ending my sorrows and my sufferings by a plunge into that gulf! And then  I felt as if I were rooted to the earth, and incapable of seeking an end  to my woes! But my hour is not yet come: I feel it is not. O Wilhelm,  how willingly could I abandon my existence to ride the whirlwind, or to  embrace the torrent! and then might not rapture perchance be the portion  of this liberated soul?    I turned my sorrowful eyes toward a favourite spot, where I was  accustomed to sit with Charlotte beneath a willow after a fatiguing  walk. Alas! it was covered with water, and with difficulty I found even  the meadow. And the fields around the hunting-lodge, thought I. Has our  dear bower been destroyed by this unpitying storm? And a beam of past  happiness streamed upon me, as the mind of a captive is illumined by  dreams of flocks and herds and bygone joys of home! But I am free from  blame. I have courage to die! Perhaps I have,--but I still sit here,  like a wretched pauper, who collects fagots, and begs her bread from  door to door, that she may prolong for a few days a miserable existence  which she is unwilling to resign.    DECEMBER 15.    What is the matter with me, dear Wilhelm? I am afraid of myself! Is not  my love for her of the purest, most holy, and most brotherly nature? Has  my soul ever been sullied by a single sensual desire? but I will make no  protestations. And now, ye nightly visions, how truly have those mortals  understood you, who ascribe your various contradictory effects to some  invincible power! This night I tremble at the avowal--I held her in my  arms, locked in a close embrace: I pressed her to my bosom, and covered  with countless kisses those dear lips which murmured in reply soft  protestations of love. My sight became confused by the delicious  intoxication of her eyes. Heavens! is it sinful to revel again in such  happiness, to recall once more those rapturous moments with intense  delight? Charlotte! Charlotte! I am lost! My senses are bewildered, my  recollection is confused, mine eyes are bathed in tears--I am ill; and  yet I am well--I wish for nothing--I have no desires--it were better I  were gone.    Under the circumstances narrated above, a determination to quit  this world had now taken fixed possession of Werther's soul. Since  Charlotte's return, this thought had been the final object of all his  hopes and wishes; but he had resolved that such a step should not be  taken with precipitation, but with calmness and tranquillity, and with  the most perfect deliberation.    His troubles and internal struggles may be understood from the following  fragment, which was found, without any date, amongst his papers, and  appears to have formed the beginning of a letter to Wilhelm.    \"Her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#19)"],[1,"as well as indirect advantages. It will give  Governments the first offer of abandoned Jewish property, and allow  buyers most favorable conditions. Governments, again, will be able to  make use of this friendly appropriation of land for the purpose of  certain social improvements.    The Jewish Company will give every assistance to Governments and  Parliaments in their efforts to direct the inner migration of  Christian citizens.    The Jewish Company will also pay heavy taxes. Its central office will  be in London, so as to be under the legal protection of a power which  is not at present Anti-Semitic. But the Company, if it is supported  officially and semi-officially, will everywhere provide a broad basis  of taxation. To this end, it will establish taxable branch offices  everywhere. Further, it will pay double duties on the two-fold  transfer of goods which it accomplishes. Even in transactions where  the Company is really nothing more than a real estate agency, it will  temporarily appear as a purchaser, and will be set down as the  momentary possessor in the register of landed property.    These are, of course, purely calculable matters. It will have to be  considered and decided in each place how far the Company can go  without running any risks of failure. And the Company itself will  confer freely with Finance Ministers on the various points at issue.  Ministers will recognize the friendly spirit of our enterprise, and  will consequently offer every facility in their power necessary for  the successful achievement of the great undertaking.    Further and direct profit will accrue to Governments from the  transport of passengers and goods, and where railways are State  property the returns will be immediately recognizable. Where they are  held by private companies, the Jewish Company will receive favorable  terms for transport, in the same way as does every transmitter of  goods on a large scale. Freight and carriage must be made as cheap as  possible for our people, because every traveller will pay his own  expenses. The middle classes will travel with Cook's tickets, the  poorer classes in emigrant trains. The Company might make a good deal  by reductions on passengers and goods; but here, as elsewhere, it must  adhere to its principle of not trying to raise its receipts to a  greater sum than will cover its working expenses.    In many places Jews have control of the transport; and the transport  businesses will be the first needed by the Company and the first to be  liquidated by it. The original owners of these concerns will either  enter the Company's service, or establish themselves independently  \"over there.\" The new arrivals will certainly require their  assistance, and theirs being a paying profession, which they may and  indeed must exercise there to earn a living, numbers of these  enterprising spirits will depart. It is unnecessary to describe all  the business details of this monster expedition. They must be  judiciously evolved out of the original plan by many able men, who  must apply their minds to achieving the best system.      SOME OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES    Many activities will be interconnected. For example: the Company will  gradually introduce the manufacture of goods into the settlements  which will, of course, be extremely primitive at their inception.  Clothing, linens, and shoes will first of all be manufactured for our  own poor emigrants, who will be provided with new suits of clothing at  the various European emigration centers. They will not receive these  clothes as alms, which might hurt their pride, but in exchange for old  garments: any loss the Company sustains by this transaction will be  booked as a business loss. Those who are absolutely without means will  pay off their debt to the Company by working overtime at a fair rate  of wage.    Existing emigration societies will be able to give valuable assistance  here, for they will do for the Company's colonists what they did  before for departing Jews. The forms of such cooperation will easily  be found.    Even the new clothing of the poor settlers will have the symbolic  meaning. \"You are now entering on a new life.\" The Society of Jews  will see to it that long before the departure and also during the  journey a serious yet festive spirit is fostered by means of prayers,  popular lectures, instruction on the object of the expedition,  instruction on hygienic matters for their new places of residence, and  guidance in regard to their future work. For the Promised Land is the  land of work. On their arrival, the emigrants will be welcomed by our  chief officials with due solemnity, but without foolish exultation,  for the Promised Land will not yet have been conquered. But these poor  people should already see that they are at home.    The clothing industries of the Company will, of course, not produce  their goods without proper organization. The Society of Jews will  obtain from the local branches information about the number,  requirements and date of arrival of the settlers, and will communicate  all such information in good time to the Jewish Company. In this way  it will be possible to provide for them with every precaution.      PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIES    The duties of the Jewish Company and the Society of Jews cannot be  kept strictly apart in this outline. These two great bodies will have  to work constantly in unison, the Company depending on the moral  authority and support of the Society, just as the Society cannot  dispense with the material assistance of the Company. For example, in  the organizing of the clothing industry, the quantity produced will at  first be kept down so as to preserve an equilibrium between supply and  demand; and wherever the Company undertakes the organization of new  industries the same precaution must be exercised.    But individual enterprise must never be checked by the Company with  its superior force. We shall only work collectively when the immense  difficulties of the task demand common action; we shall, wherever  possible, scrupulously respect the rights of the individual. Private  property, which is the economic basis of independence, shall be  developed freely and be respected by us. Our first unskilled laborers  will at once have the opportunity to work their way up to private  proprietorship.    The spirit of enterprise must, indeed, be encouraged in every possible  way. Organization of industries will be promoted by a judicious system  of duties, by the employment of cheap raw material, and by the  institution of a board to collect and publish industrial statistics.    But this spirit of enterprise must be wisely encouraged, and risky  speculation must be avoided. Every new industry must be advertised for  a long period before establishment, so as to prevent failure on the  part of those who might wish to start a similar business six months  later. Whenever a new industrial establishment is founded, the Company  should be informed, so that all those interested may obtain  information from it.    Industrialists will be able to make use of centralized labor agencies,  which will only receive a commission large enough to ensure their  continuance. The industrialists might, for example, telegraph for 500  unskilled laborers for three days, three weeks, or three months. The  labor agency would then collect these 500 unskilled laborers from  every possible source, and despatch them at once to carry out the  agricultural or industrial enterprise. Parties of workmen will thus be  systematically drafted from place to place like a body of troops.  These men will, of course, not be sweated, but will work only a  seven-hour day; and, in spite of their change of locality, they will  preserve their organization, work out their term of service, and  receive commands, promotions, and pensions. Some establishments may,  of course, be able to obtain their workmen from other sources, if they  wish, but they will not find it easy to do so. The Society will be  able to prevent the introduction of non-Jewish work-slaves by  boycotting obstinate employers, by obstructing traffic, and by  various other methods. The seven-hour workers will therefore have to  be taken, and we shall thus bring our people gradually, and without  coercion, to adopt the normal seven-hour day.      SETTLEMENT OF SKILLED LABORERS    It is clear that what can be done for unskilled workers can be even  more easily done for skilled laborers. These will work under similar  regulations in the factories, and the central labor agency will  provide them when required.    Independent operatives and small employers, must be carefully taught  on account of the rapid progress of scientific improvements, must  acquire technical knowledge even if no longer very young men, must  study the power of water, and appreciate the forces of electricity.  Independent workers must also be discovered and supplied by the  Society's agency. The local branch will apply, for example, to the  central office: \"We want so many carpenters, locksmiths, glaziers,  etc.\" The central office will publish this demand, and the proper men  will apply there for the work. These would then travel with their  families to the place where they were wanted, and would remain there  without feeling the pressure of undue competition. A permanent and  comfortable home would thus be provided for them.      METHOD OF RAISING CAPITAL    The capital required for establishing the Company was previously put  at what seemed an absurdly high figure. The amount actually necessary  will be fixed by financiers, and will in any case be a very  considerable sum. There are three ways of raising this sum, all of  which the Society will take under consideration. This Society, the  great \"Gestor\" of the Jews, will be formed by our best and most  upright men, who must not derive any material advantage from their  membership. Although the Society cannot at the"]]]
