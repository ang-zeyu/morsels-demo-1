From a rise of the road on  the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the grim Hall bristling  out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as they were, were still  younger than the building which they surrounded. Holmes pointed down the  long tract of road which wound, a reddish yellow band, between the brown  of the heath and the budding green of the woods. Far away, a black  dot, we could see a vehicle moving in our direction. Holmes gave an  exclamation of impatience.    \"I had given a margin of half an hour,\" said he. \"If that is her trap  she must be making for the earlier train. I fear, Watson, that she will  be past Charlington before we can possibly meet her.\"    From the instant that we passed the rise we could no longer see the  vehicle, but we hastened onwards at such a pace that my sedentary life  began to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall behind. Holmes,  however, was always in training, for he had inexhaustible stores of  nervous energy upon which to draw. His springy step never slowed until  suddenly, when he was a hundred yards in front of me, he halted, and I  saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair. At the  same instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering, the reins trailing,  appeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us.    \"Too late, Watson; too late!\" cried Holmes, as I ran panting to his  side. \"Fool that I was not to allow for that earlier train! It's  abduction, Watson--abduction! Murder! Heaven knows what! Block the road!  Stop the horse! That's right. Now, jump in, and let us see if I can  repair the consequences of my own blunder.\"    We had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning the horse,  gave it a sharp cut with the whip, and we flew back along the road. As  we turned the curve the whole stretch of road between the Hall and the  heath was opened up. I grasped Holmes's arm.    \"That's the man!\" I gasped.    A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. His head was down and his  shoulders rounded as he put every ounce of energy that he possessed  on to the pedals. He was flying like a racer. Suddenly he raised his  bearded face, saw us close to him, and pulled up, springing from his  machine. That coal-black beard was in singular contrast to the pallor of  his face, and his eyes were as bright as if he had a fever. He stared at  us and at the dog-cart. Then a look of amazement came over his face.    \"Halloa! Stop there!\" he shouted, holding his bicycle to block our road.  \"Where did you get that dog-cart? Pull up, man!\" he yelled, drawing a  pistol from his side pocket. \"Pull up, I say, or, by George, I'll put a  bullet into your horse.\"    Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart.    \"You're the man we want to see. Where is Miss Violet Smith?\" he said, in  his quick, clear way.    \"That's what I am asking you. You're in her dog-cart. You ought to know  where she is.\"    \"We met the dog-cart on the road. There was no one in it. We drove back  to help the young lady.\"    \"Good Lord! Good Lord! what shall I do?\" cried the stranger, in an  ecstasy of despair. \"They've got her, that hellhound Woodley and the  blackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you really are her friend. Stand  by me and we'll save her, if I have to leave my carcass in Charlington  Wood.\"    He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the hedge.  Holmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing beside the road,  followed Holmes.    \"This is where they came through,\" said he, pointing to the marks of  several feet upon the muddy path. \"Halloa! Stop a minute! Who's this in  the bush?\"    It was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed like an ostler, with  leather cords and gaiters. He lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a  terrible cut upon his head. He was insensible, but alive. A glance at  his wound told me that it had not penetrated the bone.    \"That's Peter, the groom,\" cried the stranger. \"He drove her. The beasts  have pulled him off and clubbed him. Let him lie; we can't do him any  good, but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman.\"    We ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. We had  reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when Holmes pulled up.    \"They didn't go to the house. Here are their marks on the left--here,  beside the laurel bushes! Ah, I said so!\"    As he spoke a woman's shrill scream--a scream which vibrated with a  frenzy of horror--burst from the thick green clump of bushes in front of  us. It ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke and a gurgle.    \"This way! This way! They are in the bowling alley,\" cried the  stranger, darting through the bushes. \"Ah, the cowardly dogs! Follow me,  gentlemen! Too late! too late! by the living Jingo!\"    We had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by  ancient trees. On the farther side of it, under the shadow of a mighty  oak, there stood a singular group of three people. One was a woman, our  client, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. Opposite her  stood a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs  parted wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding-crop, his whole  attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado. Between them an elderly,  grey-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit,  had evidently just completed the wedding service, for he pocketed his  prayer-book as we appeared and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the  back in jovial congratulation.    \"They're married!\" I gasped.    \"Come on!\" cried our guide; \"come on!\" He rushed across the glade,  Holmes and I at his heels. As we approached, the lady staggered against  the trunk of the tree for support. Williamson, the ex-clergyman, bowed  to us with mock politeness, and the bully Woodley advanced with a shout  of brutal and exultant laughter.    \"You can take your beard off, Bob,\" said he. \"I know you right enough.  Well, you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to  introduce you to Mrs. Woodley.\"    Our guide's answer was a singular one. He snatched off the dark beard  which had disguised him and threw it on the ground, disclosing a long,  sallow, clean-shaven face below it. Then he raised his revolver and  covered the young ruffian, who was advancing upon him with his dangerous  riding-crop swinging in his hand.    \"Yes,\" said our ally, \"I AM Bob Carruthers, and I'll see this woman  righted if I have to swing for it. I told you what I'd do if you  molested her, and, by the Lord, I'll be as good as my word!\"    \"You're too late. She's my wife!\"    \"No, she's your widow.\"    His revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt from the front of  Woodley's waistcoat. He spun round with a scream and fell upon his back,  his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor. The  old man, still clad in his surplice, burst into such a string of foul  oaths as I have never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own, but  before he could raise it he was looking down the barrel of Holmes's  weapon.    \"Enough of this,\" said my friend, coldly. \"Drop that pistol! Watson,  pick it up! Hold it to his head! Thank you. You, Carruthers, give me  that revolver. We'll have no more violence. Come, hand it over!\"    \"Who are you, then?\"    \"My name is Sherlock Holmes.\"    \"Good Lord!\"    \"You have heard of me, I see. I will represent the official police until  their arrival. Here, you!\" he shouted to a frightened groom who had  appeared at the edge of the glade. \"Come here. Take this note as hard as  you can ride to Farnham.\" He scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his  note-book. \"Give it to the superintendent at the police-station. Until  he comes I must detain you all under my personal custody.\"    The strong, masterful personality of Holmes dominated the tragic scene,  and all were equally puppets in his hands. Williamson and Carruthers  found themselves carrying the wounded Woodley into the house, and I gave  my arm to the frightened girl. The injured man was laid on his bed, and  at Holmes's request I examined him. I carried my report to where he sat  in the old tapestry-hung dining-room with his two prisoners before him.    \"He will live,\" said I.    \"What!\" cried Carruthers, springing out of his chair. \"I'll go upstairs  and finish him first. Do you tell me that that girl, that angel, is to  be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life?\"    \"You need not concern yourself about that,\" said Holmes. \"There are two  very good reasons why she should under no circumstances be his wife. In  the first place, we are very safe in questioning Mr. Williamson's right  to solemnize a marriage.\"    \"I have been ordained,\" cried the old rascal.    \"And also unfrocked.\"    \"Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.\"    \"I think not. How about the license?\"    \"We had a license for the marriage. I have it here in my pocket.\"    \"Then you got it by a trick. But in any case a forced marriage is no  marriage, but it is a very serious felony, as you will discover before  you have finished. You'll have time to think the point out during the  next ten years or so, unless I am mistaken. As to you, Carruthers, you  would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket.\"    \"I begin to think so, Mr. Holmes; but when I thought of all the  precaution I had taken to shield this girl--for I loved her, Mr. Holmes,  and it is the only time that ever I knew what love was--it fairly drove  me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and  bully in South Africa, a man whose name is a holy terror from Kimberley  to Johannesburg. Why, Mr. Holmes, you'll hardly believe it, but ever  since that girl has been in my employment I never once let her go past  this house, where I knew these rascals were lurking, without following  her on my bicycle just to see that she came to no harm. I kept my  distance from her, and I wore a beard so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#19)"],[1,"were quieted, and the first slight movement brought him up  with a rush.    Ten minutes later he lay in my canoe, where I could see him plainly to  my heart's content. I was waiting for the pool to grow quiet again, when  a new sound came from the underbrush, a rapid _plop, lop, lop, lop,  lop_, like the sound in a sunken bottle as water pours in and the air  rushes out.    There was a brook near the sounds, a lazy little stream that had lost  itself among the alders and forgotten all its music; and my first  thought was that some animal was standing in the water to drink, and  waking the voice of the brook as the current rippled past his legs. The  canoe glided over to find out what he was, when, in the midst of the  sounds, came the unmistakable _Whit-kwit?_ of partridges--and there they  were, just vanishing glimpses of alert forms and keen eyes gliding among  the tangled alder stems. When near the brook they had changed the soft,  gossipy chatter, by which a flock holds itself together in the wild  tangle of the burned lands, into a curious liquid sound, so like the  gurgling of water by a mossy stone that it would have deceived me  completely, had I not seen the birds. It was as if they tried to remind  the little alder brook of the music it had lost far back among the  hills.    Now I had been straitly charged, on leaving camp, to bring back three  partridges for our Sunday dinner. My own little flock had grown a bit  tired of trout and canned foods; and a taste of young broiled grouse,  which I had recently given them, had left them hungry for more. So I  left the pool and my fishing rod, just as the trout began to rise, to  glide into the alders with my pocket rifle.    There were at least a dozen birds there, full-grown and strong of wing,  that had not yet decided to scatter to the four winds, as had most of  the coveys which one might meet on the burned lands. All summer long,  while berries are plenty, the flocks hold together, finding ten pairs of  quiet eyes much better protection against surprises than one frightened  pair. Each flock is then under the absolute authority of the mother  bird; and one who follows them gets some curious and intensely  interesting glimpses of a partridge's education. If the mother bird is  killed, by owl or hawk or weasel, the flock still holds together, while  berries last, under the leadership of one of their own number, more bold  or cunning than the others. But with the ripening autumn, when the birds  have learned, or think they have learned, all the sights and sounds and  dangers of the wilderness, the covey scatters; partly to cover a wider  range in feeding as food grows scarcer; partly in natural revolt at  maternal authority, which no bird or animal likes to endure after he has  once learned to take care of himself.    I followed the flock rapidly, though cautiously, through an interminable  tangle of alders that bordered the little stream, and learned some  things about them; though they gave me no chance whatever for a rifle  shot. The mother was gone; their leader was a foxy bird, the smallest  of the lot, who kept them moving in dense cover, running, crouching,  hiding, inquisitive about me and watching me, yet keeping themselves  beyond reach of harm. All the while the leader talked to them, a curious  language of cheepings and whistlings; and they answered back with  questions or sharp exclamations as my head appeared in sight for a  moment. Where the cover was densest they waited till I was almost upon  them before they whisked out of sight; and where there was a bit of  opening they whirred up noisily on strong wings, or sailed swiftly away  from a fallen log with the noiseless flight that a grouse knows so well  how to use when the occasion comes.    Already the instinct to scatter was at work among them. During the day  they had probably been feeding separately along the great hillside; but  with lengthening shadows they came together again to face the wilderness  night in the peace and security of the old companionship. And I had  fortunately been quiet enough at my fishing to hear when the leader  began to call them together and they had answered, here and there, from  their feeding.    I gave up following them after a while--they were too quick for me in  the alder tangle--and came out of the swamp to the ridge. There I ran  along a deer path and circled down ahead of them to a thicket of cedar,  where I thought they might pass the night.    Presently I heard them coming--_Whit-kwit? pr-r-r, pr-r-r, prut,  prut!_--and saw five or six of them running rapidly. The little leader  saw me at the same instant and dodged back out of sight. Most of his  flock followed him; but one bird, more inquisitive than the rest, jumped  to a fallen log, drew himself up straight as a string, and eyed me  steadily. The little rifle spoke at his head promptly; and I stowed him  away comfortably, a fine plump bird, in a big pocket of my hunting  shirt.    At the report another partridge, questioning the unknown sound, flew to  a thick spruce, pressed close against the trunk to hide himself, and  stood listening intently. Whether he was waiting to hear the sound  again, or was frightened and listening for the call of the leader, I  could not tell. I fired at his head quickly, and saw him sail down  against the hillside, with a loud thump and a flutter of feathers behind  him to tell me that he was hard hit.    I followed him up the hill, hearing an occasional flutter of wings to  guide my feet, till the sounds vanished into a great tangle of  underbrush and fallen trees. I searched here ten minutes or more in  vain, then listened in the vast silence for a longer period; but the  bird had hidden himself away in some hole or covert where an owl might  pass by without finding him. Reluctantly I turned away toward the swamp.    Close beside me was a fallen log; on my right was another; and the two  had fallen so as to make the sides of a great angle, their tops resting  together against the hill. Between the two were several huge trees  growing among the rocks and underbrush. I climbed upon one of these  fallen trees and moved along it cautiously, some eight or ten feet above  the ground, looking down searchingly for a stray brown feather to guide  me to my lost partridge.    Suddenly the log under my feet began to rock gently. I stopped in  astonishment, looking for the cause of the strange teetering; but there  was nothing on the log beside myself. After a moment I went on again,  looking again for my partridge. Again the log rocked, heavily this time,  almost throwing me off. Then I noticed that the tip of the other log,  which lay balanced across a great rock, was under the tip of my log and  was being pried up by something on the other end. Some animal was there,  and it flashed upon me suddenly that he was heavy enough to lift my  weight with his stout lever. I stole along so as to look behind a great  tree--and there on the other log, not twenty feet away, a big bear was  standing, twisting himself uneasily, trying to decide whether to go on  or go back on his unstable footing.    He discovered me at the instant that my face appeared behind the tree.  Such surprise, such wonder I have seldom seen in an animal's face. For a  long moment he met my eyes steadily with his. Then he began to twist  again, while the logs rocked up and down. Again he looked at the strange  animal on the other log; but the face behind the tree had not moved nor  changed; the eyes looked steadily into his. With a startled movement he  plunged off into the underbrush, and but for a swift grip on a branch  the sudden lurch would have sent me off backward among the rocks. As he  jumped I heard a swift flutter of wings. I followed it timidly, not  knowing where the bear was, and in a moment I had the second partridge  stowed away comfortably with his brother in my hunting shirt.    The rest of the flock had scattered widely by this time. I found one or  two and followed them; but they dodged away into the thick alders, where  I could not find their heads quick enough with my rifle sight. After a  vain, hasty shot or two I went back to my fishing.    Woods and lake were soon quiet again. The trout had stopped rising, in  one of their sudden moods. A vast silence brooded over the place,  unbroken by any buzz of my noisy reel, and the twilight shadows were  growing deeper and longer, when the soft, gliding, questioning chatter  of partridges came floating out of the alders. The leader was there, in  the thickest tangle--I had learned in an hour to recognize his peculiar  _Prut, prut_--and from the hillside and the alder swamp and the big  evergreens his scattered flock were answering; here a _kwit_, and there  a _prut_, and beyond a swift burr of wings, all drawing closer and  closer together.    I had still a third partridge to get for my own hungry flock; so I stole  swiftly back into the alder swamp. There I found a little game path and  crept along it on hands and knees, drawing cautiously near to the  leader's continued calling.    [Illustration: \"THEY WOULD TURN THEIR HEADS AND LISTEN INTENTLY\"]    In the midst of a thicket of low black alders, surrounded by a perfect  hedge of bushes, I found him at last. He was on the lower end of a  fallen log, gliding rapidly up and down, spreading wings and tail and  budding ruff, as if he were drumming, and sending out his peculiar call  at every pause. Above him, in a long line on the same log, five other  partridges were sitting perfectly quiet, save now and then, when an  answer came to the leader's call, they would turn their heads and listen  intently till the underbrush parted cautiously and another bird flitted  up beside them. Then another call, and from the distant hillside a faint  _kwit-kwit_ and a rush of wings in answer, and another partridge would  shoot in on swift pinions to pull himself up on the log beside his  fellows.
