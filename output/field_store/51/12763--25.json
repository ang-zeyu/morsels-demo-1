Last spring the same Indian caught a  bear in a deadfall. On the animal's side was a long rip from some other  bear's claw, and the wound had been smeared thickly with soft spruce  resin. This last experience corresponds closely with one of my own. I  shot a bear years ago in northern New Brunswick that had received a  gunshot wound, which had raked him badly and then penetrated the leg. He  had plugged the wound carefully with clay, evidently to stop the  bleeding, and then had covered the broken skin with sticky mud from the  river's brink, to keep the flies away from the wound and give it a  chance to heal undisturbed. It is noteworthy here that the bear uses  either gum or clay indifferently, while the beaver and muskrat seem to  know enough to avoid the clay, which would be quickly washed off in the  water.\"    Animals not only know how to doctor themselves when they are sick, but  some of them, such as the fox, have learned how to make artificial heat  by covering green leaves with dirt. And while they do not make fire,  their homes are often heated in this practical way, and thus sickness  avoided. Domestic horses and dogs wear hats in summer, and possibly in  the future they will learn the enormous importance of wearing clothes!  Trained monkeys already take great delight in dressing up, and dogs  like smart suits.    Monkeys show the greatest interest and brotherly love when one of their  number is injured. Watson tells of a female monkey that was shot and  carried into a tent. Several of her tribe advanced with frightful  gestures, and only stopped when met with a gun. The chief of the tribe  then came forward, chattering and remonstrating vigorously. But as he  came nearer, there was every evidence of grief and supplication for the  body. As he was given the body, he affectionately took it in his arms  and slowly moved to his companions, and like a silent funeral procession  they all walked away.    Nor does their interest cease with life, for we are told by no less  authority than Col. Theodore Roosevelt of a large grizzly bear that was  discovered lying across the trail in the woods. The hunter shot her as  she was preparing to charge him, and later he examined the spot where  she was lying, and found that it was the newly made grave of her cub.  Evidently some animal had killed the cub in her absence, and she, in her  grief, was determined to avenge the wrong by lying in wait for the  enemy.    Public meetings for civic council and religious worship are not confined  to man alone. In Macgrave's _History of Brazil_ we are told of a  species of South American monkey known as the ouraines, which the  natives call preachers of the woods. These highly intelligent creatures  assemble every morning and evening, when the leader takes a place apart  from the rest and addresses them from his pulpit or platform, Having  taken his position, he signals to the others to be seated, after which  he speaks to them in a language loud and rapid, with the gestures of a  Billy Sunday, the audience listening in profound silence. He then  signals again with his paws, when all cry out together in apparently  confused noises, until another signal for silence comes from their  leader. Then follows another discourse, at the close of which the  assembly disperses. Macgrave attempts no explanation as to the object of  these addresses; but if his accounts be true, surely they must have as  much meaning for the monkeys as many of our public lectures and church  services have for us! No doubt much of the advice imparted concerns the  personal and collective welfare of the tribe members.          IX    SELF-DEFENCE AND HOME-GOVERNMENT      _\"In the days of yore, when the world was young,      Sages of asses spoke, and poets sung;    In God's own book we find their humble name,      Some enrolled upon the scroll of fame.\"_      There is no phase of animal life which is more interesting than that  through which Nature governs and protects her children. Each and every  species of animal possesses the method of self-defence and protection  best adapted to it. Most of the larger animals are of themselves so  powerful that they need no protection other than that afforded by their  strength, while most of the weaker and less aggressive animals are  provided with some special method of defence.    The tiger, lion, panther, and wolf have formidable claws and teeth;  while the shark has such immense jaws that he can sever the head of a  goat at one bite. And most of them are in reality tyrants. They rule by  tyranny--the oppression of the weak by the strong, whether that strength  be physical or mental,--a trait as common in animals as in man. Among  the animals it takes the commonest form, and they not only oppress the  weak, but actually kill and eat them, even though they oftentimes are  members of the same family. They are exactly like human cannibals, no  better and no worse.    Flight is perhaps the simplest and most natural method of defence. The  swifter animals, however, such as deer, gazelles, and hares, which may  easily escape by running their fastest, do not always use this method,  but have other means so ingenious as to be real arts. Wolves, when they  see that they are outnumbered, will sometimes escape by following the  exact tracks of a single leader through the snow, and from all  appearances only one has passed the way over which a hundred may have  gone. Hares will separate and run in opposite directions, while  gazelles, if too closely pursued, will jump to one side and lie flat on  the earth to escape notice, and as soon as the enemies have passed, run  in the opposite direction.    It oftentimes happens that aggressively disposed animals, like cowardly  men, are apt to try battle with the unlikeliest adversaries. A  missionary from India tells the story of an alligator who was enjoying a  noonday sleep on the bank of a river, when an immense tiger emerged  from the jungle, made straight for the sleeping saurian until within  leaping distance, when he sprang on the alligator's back, and gained a  strangle hold before the sleeping monster could awake. At first the  tiger was master, for the alligator could not bring his huge jaws into  action, and while lashing viciously at the tiger with his tail, he was  dragged into the jungle. What happened there no one could see, but in a  few moments the tiger dashed out of the jungle and disappeared in the  cane brakes, and the alligator reappeared and crawled into the water.    The ape and the baboon are the most skilled of all animals in making  their flight. They use every method known to man, and because of their  swiftness of action excel man in certain ways. Like man, in the face of  danger, they show great bravery and never lose their presence of mind.  The ape is fast disappearing before man, but against other animals and  Nature he can well protect himself. He is even braver than the lion, who  in captivity allows himself to be petted, but rarely is this true of the  ape, and then only when conditions seem insurmountable.    In making his escape from an enemy, the ape directs his flight in the  most self-possessed and human-like way, never losing his head, and  taking advantage of the first shelter or protection that he meets; if  the young, or females, or aged linger behind, a strong army of males  bravely returns to rescue them at the danger of losing their own lives.  Many of their brave deeds, if recorded in history, would compare  favourably with those of mankind! Too often has a poor, sickly ape,  which by his very feebleness allowed himself to be captured and placed  in a zoo, been compared to human beings. Even in spirit and movements he  has been considered as a human caricature and heaped with ridicule. We  have continually considered his defects, without noticing his better  qualities. We would have a much higher idea of his great family, if we  would take a human derelict and compare him to an ape ruler! This  comparison would be more just.    Certain of the baboon tribes which live among the rocks of high  mountains and cliffs, if pursued by enemies, protect themselves by  ingeniously rolling immense stones down upon their foes. They also hurl  with great force small stones about the size of one's hand. As these  tribes have each from one hundred to three hundred members, they  constitute a formidable grenade army!    In addition to their skilled methods of flight, the baboons, apes, and  monkeys come next to certain of the cat tribes as the greatest fighters  in the animal world. This is astonishing when we remember that these  animals are not professional warriors, nor do they have to fight to  obtain their food. Their greatest defence is their quickness and powers  of biting. When they are attacked by a dog, they usually bite off a foot  or an ear, or leave him minus a tail!    One of the bravest and fiercest of fighters is the bull-dog. Three of  these animals together have been known to capture and hold a large bull.  Deer, when fighting among themselves, often play more than anything, and  are not serious. Red deer seldom injure one another with their long  antlers, but they could easily kill a dog or even a man. Stags, however,  often fight to death, in some instances locking horns and tumbling over  a precipice.    The most ingenious of all the horned fighters is the sable antelope,  whose clever system of self-defence might well be taught in war-schools.  His horns are long, sharp-pointed, and bend backwards. When wounded, or  attacked by wolves or dogs, he lies down, and scientifically covers his  back by rapid fencing with his pointed horns. He can quickly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19855"],[0,"Louis' School Days: A Story for Boys (#19)"],[1," had had no control, had placed them out  of the temptations that had overcome their penitent school-fellow, did  not esteem themselves better than he, and look scornfully upon him, as  though they would say with the proud Pharisee of old, \"Stand by, for  I am holier than thou!\" And is it not the case around us generally?  Alas! how apt we are all to condemn our fellow-creatures; forgetting  that, had we been throughout similarly situated, our course might have  been the same, or even worse. \"Who is it that has made us to differ  from another?\"    Louis, as I have mentioned, felt very deeply for Ferrers; for, besides  their late close connection, had he not known what it was to suffer for  sin? He knew what it was to carry about a heavy heart, and to wake in the  morning as if life had no joy to give; and he knew, too, what it was to  lay his sins at a Saviour's feet, and to take the light yoke upon him.  How anxious was he to lead his fellow-sinner there! Though his simple  efforts seemed impotent at the time, years after, when his school-fellow  had grown a steady and useful Christian, he dated his first serious  impressions to this time of disgrace; and the remembrance of Louis'  sweet conduct was often before him.    Louis' mind had been so chastened by his previous adversity that his  present prosperity was meekly though thankfully borne. It came like  sunshine after showers, cheering and refreshing his path, but not  too powerful; for he was gradually learning more and more, to fear  any thing that had a tendency to draw his mind to rest complacently  on himself.    But the prize-day came--the joyful breaking-up-day--the day that was  to bring his dear parents; and of all the bounding hearts, there were  none more so than those of the two brothers. Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer had  given their boys reason to expect them in the afternoon of that day,  and they were to go from Clifton to Heronhurst before returning home.    Although Dr. Wilkinson's breaking-up-day was not ostensibly a public  day, yet so many of the pupils' friends claimed admittance to the  hall on the occasion, that it became so in fact, and was usually very  respectably attended. Many of the doctor's old pupils came, to recall  their old feelings, by a sight of this most memorable exhibition. And  on this day, Vernon Digby was present with a younger brother, not to  witness Frank's triumph, for that young gentleman had none to boast of,  but to look on the theatre of his former fame, and to see how his place  was now filled.    Dr. Wilkinson's high desk had been removed from the dais, and in  its place stood a long table covered with a red cloth, on which were  arranged a number of handsomely bound books of different sizes; and in  front of the dais, in a semicircular form, were placed the rows of seats  for the boys. On each side of this semicircle, and behind and parallel  with Dr. Wilkinson's seat, was accommodation for the spectators. The  room was in the most inviting order, and had been hung with garlands  of flowers by the boys. At eleven o'clock the pupils assembled, and  under the inspection of two of the under masters, seated themselves in  the places assigned them, the little boys being placed in the front row.    As the exact fate of each was unknown, though tolerably accurately  guessed, there was much anxiety. Some of the youths were quite silent  and pale, others endeavored to hide their agitation by laughing and  talking quietly, and some affected to consider their nearest companion  as more sure than themselves. Even Hamilton was not free from a little  nervousness, and though he talked away to Vernon Digby, who was sitting  by him, he cast more than one fidgety glance at the red-covered table,  and perceptibly changed color when the class-room door opened to allow  the long train of ladies and gentlemen to enter, and closed after  Dr. Wilkinson, and a few of his particular friends, among whom were  two great scholars who had assisted in the examination of the past week.    When every one was comfortably settled, Dr. Wilkinson leaned forward  over the table, and drew a paper towards him. His preliminary \"hem\" was  the signal for many fidgety motions on the forms in front of him, and  every eye was riveted on him as he prefaced his distribution of the  prizes by a short statement of his general satisfaction, and a slight  notice of those particular points in which he could desire improvement.  He then spoke of his pleasure at the report his friends had made of  the proficiency of the upper classes, and particularly alluding to the  first class, stopped and mentioned by name those who had especially  distinguished themselves. Among these, as a matter of course, Hamilton  stood foremost, and carried away the prize for Latin composition, as  well as another. Ferrers gained that for mathematics--and two other  prizes were awarded to the next in order. Dr. Wilkinson mentioned  Frank Digby as having taken so high a place during the examination,  as to induce one of the gentlemen who assisted him to consider him  entitled to one of the classical prizes; but the doctor added that  Frank Digby's indifference and idleness during the term had made him  so unwilling that he should, by mere force of natural ability, deprive  his more industrious class-fellows of a hard-earned honor, that he had  not felt himself justified in listening to the recommendation, but  hoped that his talents would, the following term, be exerted from the  beginning, in which case, he should have pleasure in awarding to him  the meed of successful application.    Frank colored, half angrily, but said, _sotto voce_,    \"I don't care--I just like to see whether I can't do as well as any one  else without fagging.\"    Vernon was half provoked and half amused at his brother's discomfiture.    Then came Reginald's turn, and he carried off three out of the  four prizes of his class, leaving one for John Salisbury.    As each one was called up to receive his reward, an immense clapping  and stamping took place, and Louis, all exuberance, stamped most  vigorously when his brother and his particular friends went up. There  were very slight manifestations when poor Ferrers was summoned, but  Louis exerted himself so manfully in the applauding department, that  the contagion spread a little before the despised recipient was seated.    The other classes were taken in order; and when all was finished,  Dr. Wilkinson took up a little morocco case, and, after clearing his  throat once or twice, began anew:    \"There remains now but one reward to be assigned, but it is the greatest  of all, though undoubtedly that one which it is the most difficult to  adjudge rightly. It is the medal for good conduct. Hitherto it has been  my practice never to give it to any one who has not been with me the  whole term, but on the present occasion I am inclined to depart from  my custom in favor of a young gentleman whose conduct has been most  praiseworthy, though he has only been with me since Easter. Before  adjudging it, I will, however, appeal to the young gentlemen themselves,  and ask them who they think among them is the most deserving of this  honor?\"    Dr. Wilkinson paused, and immediately a shout, led by Hamilton, arose,  of \"Louis Mortimer.\"    \"I expected it,\" said the doctor, with a smile: \"Louis Mortimer  has been placed, perhaps, in a situation in the school a little  beyond him, and has, therefore, made no great figure in the  examination, but of his conduct I can speak in the highest terms,  and believe that his sense of duty is so strong that he only wants  the conviction that it is his duty to exert himself a little more,  to make him for the future as habitually industrious as he has been  during the last six weeks.--Louis Mortimer!\"    Almost overcome with astonishment and delight, Louis hardly understood  the summons, but Reginald whispered, \"Go, Louis, the doctor calls you,\"  and all made way for him with the most pleasant looks of sympathy and  congratulation. His modesty and elegance prepossessed the spectators  greatly in his favor, as he passed timidly along the ranks to the table.  Dr. Wilkinson smiled kindly on him as he delivered the bright silver  medal, in its claret-colored case, saying as he did so,    \"I have the greatest pleasure in giving this to you, and trust that you  will be encouraged, when you look on it, to go on as you have begun.\"    Louis was covered with blushes--he bowed, and as he turned away, the  most deafening applause greeted him; and, as the last prize was now  given, the boys left their seats and mingled among the company. Louis  was drawn immediately into a little coterie, composed of Hamilton,  Reginald, his three cousins, and one or two others, all of whom  congratulated him upon his distinction.    \"And so, Louis, you are the hero,\" said Vernon; \"and what is the  drama in which you have been acting so much to your credit?\"    \"Too long a tale to tell now,\" replied Hamilton, smiling on Louis;  \"we will talk over it by and by. We have been treating him very ill,  Digby, but next half-year we shall understand him better--shall we  not, Louis?\"    Louis was so full of delight that he could hardly speak--it was  especially a happy moment to stand before his cousin Vernon with  a right fame and well-established character.    \"I said my magic knew who would gain the medal,\" said Frank.    \"But your magic did not anticipate such magnificent honors for  yourself, I imagine,\" said Vernon.    \"I was a little out,\" said Frank, carelessly; \"for it has proved that  Lady Louisa has all the goodness, and I the genius. My head is quite  overloaded with the laurels Fudge heaped on me: I shan't be able to  hold it up these holidays.\"    \"A good thing that something will press it down: it is generally high  enough,\" remarked Hamilton.    \"How delighted father and mother will be to hear of your industry!\"  said Vernon.    \"I am sure,\" replied the"]]]
