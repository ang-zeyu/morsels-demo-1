I never could  bear that!\"    \"But you want to find your folks, don't you?\" asked Alice.    \"That's the queer part of it,\" Estelle replied. \"I seem never to have  had any relatives. The way I feel about it now, I would never know that  I had had a father or a mother. I seem to have just 'growed,' the way  poor Topsy did in Uncle Tom's Cabin. That is another strange part of my  present existence. I seem to be in a world by myself, and, as far as I  can tell, I have always been there.\"    \"What about Lieutenant Varley?\" inquired Alice.    \"Lieutenant Varley?\" and Estelle's voice showed that she was puzzled.    \"The young officer who said he met you in Portland.\"    \"Oh, yes. I had forgotten. Well, I have absolutely no recollection of  that, and I'm sure I would remember if I had been in the West. I'm  certain I never was there.\"    \"And yet if you weren't in the West how did you learn to ride so well?\"  Ruth queried.    \"That's another part of the puzzle, my dear. Riding seems to come as  natural to me as breathing. I don't seem ever to have learned it any  more than I learned how to dance. I seem always to have known how.\"    \"There's only one way to account for that,\" Alice said.    \"How?\"    \"From the fact that you must have started to learn to ride and to dance  when you were very young--a mere child.\"    \"I suppose that would account for it. And yet, I can't remember ever  being a child. I don't recall having played with dolls or having made  mud pies. For me my existence begins about three or four years back, and  goes on from there, mostly in moving pictures.\"    \"It is a queer case,\" commented Ruth. \"I don't know what to do to help  you. Perhaps it would be a good thing to speak to Mr. Pertell about it.  Often when children have been kidnapped, you know, their pictures are  flashed on the screen in hundreds of cities, and sometimes persons in  the audiences recognize them. That might be done with you, Estelle.\"    \"No, I wouldn't dream of doing that. Perhaps something may turn up some  day that will tell me who I really am. And perhaps I shall be sorry for  having learned.\"    \"No, you will not!\" declared Alice. \"You come of good people--one can  easily tell that.\"    \"Thank you, dear. And now I have inflicted enough of my troubles on you.  Let's talk about something pleasant.\"    \"You haven't burdened us with your troubles, Estelle dear,\" insisted  Ruth. \"It is a strange story, and we are interested in the outcome.\"    \"Indeed we are,\" said Alice. \"We want very much to help you.\"    \"That's good of you. But I don't see what you can do. I'm just a sort of  Topsy, and Topsy I'll remain. Now please don't say anything about what I  have told you to any one--not even to your father--unless I give you  permission. I don't want to be the object of curiosity, as well as of  suspicion.\"    \"Suspicion!\" cried Alice.    \"Yes, about Miss Dixon's ring.\"    \"Oh! no one in the world believes you took that--not even Miss Dixon  herself. I believe she has found the old paste diamond, and is too mean  to admit it!\" cried impulsive Alice.    \"You mustn't say such things!\" objected her sister.    \"Well, neither must she, then. Oh, Estelle! Wouldn't it be great if you  should prove to be the daughter of a millionaire!\"    \"Too great, my dear. Don't let's think about it. But I feel better for  having unburdened some of my troubles on you. And if you will still be  as nice to me as you always have been----\"    \"Why shouldn't we be?\" asked Ruth.    \"Oh, I don't know, but I thought----\"    \"Silly!\" cried Alice, as she threw her arms about the strange girl and  kissed her.    Suddenly, from a distant hill, came a dull, booming sound, that, low as  it was, seemed to make the very ground tremble.    \"What's that?\" cried Alice.    \"Thunder,\" suggested Ruth.    \"It sounded more like an explosion,\" asserted Estelle.    \"There it goes again!\" exclaimed Alice.    \"Look!\" cried her sister.    She pointed through the open window, and as the girls peered out they  saw the top of the hill fly upward in a shower of dirt and stones.    Once more the deep boom sounded.    \"It's a big gun!\" cried Alice. \"I remember, now. Mr. Pertell said he  wanted pictures of a siege of a fort, and he sent for a big gun to get  explosive effects. Come on over!\"    \"And be blown to pieces?\" objected Ruth. \"Don't dare go, Alice DeVere!\"    \"Oh, come on! There's no danger. Russ is going to make the films. I  guess they're just trying it now. It's too late to make good pictures.  Come on.\"    \"I'll go,\" offered Estelle. \"I don't mind the noise.\"    Ruth declined to go, so the other two girls set off. On the porch they  met Russ and Paul, who confirmed their guess that it was a big siege gun  which Mr. Pertell had sent to New York to get, so he might show the  effect of explosive shells.    \"I'm going to film some to-morrow,\" Russ said.    \"Be careful,\" urged Alice. \"Don't get blown up!\"    \"I'm no more anxious for that than any one,\" laughed Russ, and together  they set off toward the place where the big gun was being tried out.          CHAPTER XX    A WRONG SHOT      The big gun which Mr. Pertell had secured to make more realistic the war  play he was preparing for the films, was an old fashioned siege rifle,  made toward the close of the Civil conflict. It had not been used more  than a few times, and then it had been stored away in some arsenal. The  director, hearing of it, had secured it to fire at a certain hill on Oak  Farm.    This hill would, in the motion pictures, form a stronghold of the  Southern forces and it would be demolished by shells from the large  cannon, and then would follow a charge on the part of the Union  soldiers.    Real shells, with large explosive charges in them, would be used, but it  is needless to say that when the shots were fired at the hill the  players taking the parts of the Southerners would be at a safe distance.    \"They're just trying it out now,\" observed Russ, who with Paul, was  walking over the fields with Alice and Estelle. \"Mr. Pertell wants to  get the range, and decide on the best places from which to make the  pictures. I think we'll film some to-morrow if it's a good day.\"    \"What's the matter with your eyes, Estelle?\" asked Paul, as he looked at  her. \"Were you working in the studio to-day? I know those lights always  affect my sight.\"    \"Why, no, I wasn't in the studio,\" and then Estelle realized why her  eyes were so inflamed--it was from crying. She gave Alice a meaning  glance, as though to enjoin silence, but she need have had no fears.  Alice would not betray the secret.    The big gun had been mounted on a level piece of land, not far from the  hill, and on this plain had been thrown up earthworks behind which the  Union forces would take their stand in an effort to reduce the  Confederate stronghold.    \"They're going to fire!\" cried Estelle as they came within sight of the  gun, and saw, by the activities of the men about it, that a shot was  about to be delivered.    Alice covered her ears with her hands, and Russ and Paul stood on their  tiptoes and opened their mouths wide.    \"What in the world are they doing that for?\" asked Estelle.    \"I can't hear a word you say!\" called Alice, making her voice loud, to  overcome her own hearing handicap.    \"There she goes!\" cried Russ.    The earth trembled as flames and smoke belched from the muzzle of the  cannon, and the girls screamed.    Something black was seen for an instant in the air amid the swirl of  smoke, and then another portion of the hill was seen to lift itself up  into the air and dirt and stones were scattered about.    \"A good shot!\" observed Russ, letting himself down off his tiptoes.  \"That would make a dandy scene for the film.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Paul, also letting himself down and closing his  opened mouth.    \"Why did you do that?\" asked Estelle, when the echoes of the firing had  died away. \"Why did you stand on your toes, and open your mouths?\"    \"To lessen the shock to our ear drums,\" answered Paul. \"It is the  concussion, that is, the rushing back of air into the vacuum caused by  the shot, that does the damage. By opening your mouth you equalize the  air pressure on the inside and the outside of your ear drums, just as  you do when you go through a river tunnel. When there is a partial  vacuum outside your ear, the air inside you presses the drum outward,  and by opening your mouth--or by swallowing you make the pressure  equal. Sometimes the pressure outside is greater than the pressure  inside, and you must also equalize that before you can be comfortable.\"    \"But that wasn't why you stood on your toes,\" Alice said.    \"No; we did that to have less surface of our bodies on the ground so the  vibration would be less. If one could leap up off the earth at the exact  moment a shot was fired it would be much better, but it is hard to jump  at the right instant, and standing on one's toes is nearly as good. Then  you present only a comparatively small point which the vibrations of the  earth, caused by the explosion of the gun, can act upon.\"    \"That's a good thing to remember,\" Estelle said. \"Are they going to fire  again?\"    \"It looks so,\" observed Russ. \"But if they knock away too much of the  hill there won't be any left for the pictures to-morrow.\"    \"I believe they want to make the top of the hill flat,\" said Paul. \"They  are going to have some sort of hand-to-hand fight on it after the  Unionists capture it,\" he went on. \"I heard Mr. Pertell speaking of it.\"    \"There goes another!\" cried Alice, as she saw the same preparations as  before and one man standing near the gun to pull the lanyard, which, by  means of a friction tube, exploded the charge.    Once more the projectile shot out and, burying itself in the soft dirt  of the hill, threw it up in a shower.    \"That'll save me a lot of work!\" exclaimed a voice behind the young  people, and, turning, they saw Sandy Apgar smiling at them.

Fig. 139 illustrates another way of using these  spangles to form a long tail shape. Here again they are attached with  the help of pieces of purl. In the same figure are given some  illustrations of the use of the fancy threads; to learn more about them  the student should examine XVIth to XVIIIth century gold work during  which period they were in popular use.

CHAPTER XII    LETTERING, HERALDRY, AND EMBLEMS      The Uses of Lettering--Marking--Monograms--Heraldry--Emblems.      Lettering of one kind or another is frequently in request. It is useful  for inscriptions, verses, names attached to figures, the signing and  dating of work, and for the more ordinary purposes of marking linen and  so forth. Signed and dated work has peculiar attractiveness: it can be  placed amidst definite historical associations: an authenticated piece  of embroidery, say of the reign of King Richard Coeur de Lion, Queen  Anne, or George III., would be an historical document and a standard to  gauge the period of any uninscribed examples. Although few of us are  likely to possess treasures of the XIIIth century, signed and dated  pieces of our great-grandmothers' embroideries are interesting personal  landmarks in family history, so for this reason, amongst others,  unostentatious marks of identification are by no means out of place.  Descriptive names or verses are also a means of amplifying the story and  so enlivening our curiosity.    [Illustration: Fig. 140.]    Lettering can answer a further purpose still; it can enrich the design,  for, if rightly chosen and employed, letters are very decorative. They  may be seen forming a border to a piece of work. The three letters in  fig. 140 were taken from an XIth century embroidered cope, which has a  fine inscription running round the entire lower margin.[13] The names of  the saints and martyrs standing in rows in the columned arcades,  affected at certain periods, are sometimes inscribed in the mouldings of  the arches above them or along the base; kneeling donors can be seen  naively presenting a little scroll inscribed with prayers, and many  other interesting uses of lettering might be recalled. The names St.  Luke and St. John, shown in fig. 141, are taken from a beautiful  embroidered example of Gothic lettering.    [Illustration: Fig. 141.]    Illuminated manuscripts supply fine examples of initial letters and  writing. A visit to the show-cases in the King's Library at the British  Museum will be of great interest to the student; the illustrations also  to be seen there, the beautifully composed and coloured figure-subjects,  would be equally suitable for carrying out in embroidery; indeed it is  very probable that many of the figure compositions on the old copes and  chasubles were derived from such a source. Fig. 142 gives as an example  of an alphabet one taken from a Benedictionale of late XVth century  date.    [Illustration: Fig. 142.]    A practical purpose to which lettering is often put is the marking of  linen. To learn how to do this used to be a recognised part of a girl's  education, and was one of the objects of the sampler. Marking can be  anything from a simple cross-stitch initial to an elaborately worked  monogram. For simple work the corner to be marked can be tacked upon  _toile ciree_, a material not unlike American cloth. Tambour frames  also are useful for this purpose.    Fig. 143 shows the stitches most used for working simple letters such as  those seen upon the old samplers. The first is cross stitch, which for  marking purposes should be worked so as to be alike on both sides. To do  this requires some forethought whilst the work progresses, and  necessitates an occasional doubling of one of the crossed stitches, in  order to reach the point for commencing the next one and at the same  time preserving a cross on each side.    [Illustration: Fig. 143.]    The second stitch in the diagram shows a square on one side and is a  cross upon the reverse. This makes a good stitch for the purpose, is  quite simple to manipulate, and is easier to manage than the cross on  both sides.    The third example is made use of when a larger letter is required. It is  known as blanket stitch, and is used for the marking of such things. It  may be further completed by a neat back stitch just fitting along the  outside edges of the other stitches.    [Illustration: Fig. 144.]    Many embroidery stitches are suitable for marking purposes, such as  satin, chain, stem, back, rope, basket, and others. The Oriental stitch  which carries out the letter in fig. 144 is a good one when both sides  can be seen, for though these are quite different, it is presentable  upon either. The diagram shows the appearance of the stitch on the front  and on the back.    A simple initial letter may be made interesting by enriching the ground  behind it with some form of diaper patterning. An example of this is  shown in fig. 145. The letter could be worked in a plain satin stitch  over a padding of threads, and the pattern on the ground in a darning  stitch and French knots, or in any other suitable way.    [Illustration: Fig. 145.]    A monogram carried out in embroidery can be a very pretty thing; there  is scope in it for ingenuity both of design and of stitching. The  letters may be decorated and tied up with a floral spray, strap work or  a combination of several _motifs_. Fig. 146 shows a monogram composed of  the letters I. G. ornamented and bound together by a ribbon-like  interlacing band. The letters are worked in a raised satin stitch, and a  running stitch in another colour threads in and out down the centre of  each letter. The outline is stem stitch in a darker colour. The band is  outlined on both sides with an overcast stitch, which always makes a  particularly neat edging for anything of this sort. The centre is filled  with a row of French knots, the tassels are worked in close lines of  stem stitch, and the petals of the small flowers in satin stitch,  finished off with a French knot at the centre.    [Illustration: Fig. 146.]    Another mark of proprietorship and origin was the shield of arms of the  owner, which introduces the subject of heraldry. A shield executed with  the needle is often seen, and looks particularly rich. Heraldry is an  intricate science, full of pitfalls for the unwary, and demands an  earnest study of its complex rules and regulations. Every one should  know at least some fine examples of great national shields such as the  Lions of England, the Fleur de Lys of France, and the Imperial Eagle.  Examples of shields surmounted by helmets and crests with quaint and  flowing mantling are to be seen in all kinds of art work.    Various stitches and methods specially lend themselves to the expression  of heraldry. Those which, like cross stitch, impose a certain  simplicity, are very good. Another suitable medium is applied work, of  which an illustration can be seen on page 95. Gold and silver thread are  very useful here, and look exceptionally rich when couched in the XIIIth  century method. Fig. 147 is an embroidered coat of arms dated the first  half of the XIVth century. It is executed almost entirely in the _point  couche rentre ou retire_. The arms are those of the Clinton and  Leyburne families--_argent, 6 cross crosslets fitchee 3, 2 and 1 on a  chief azure, two mullets or_.    [Illustration: Fig. 147.]    In designing heraldic work care must be taken to introduce no debased  forms such as were current after the XVth century. The XIIIth and XIVth  centuries are the periods considered best for the study of this subject.  Heraldry sometimes adds historic interest to embroideries; owners or  donors may be traced by their coat of arms appearing upon some part of  the work.    [Illustration: Fig. 148.]    Allied to heraldry and marking are a number of decorative objects that  have acquired peculiar traditional significance of an emblematic or  symbolical nature, hard to define. The Cross of Christianity may be  instanced, the olive branch of peace, the mirror of truth, and the snake  of eternity. The name of a saint is frequently declared by an emblem  accompanying the figure. In appropriate surroundings emblems may often  be used effectively. For knowledge about these things the student must  go to various books that deal with the special subject. Fig. 148 is an  illustration of the well-known emblem, the Pelican in her piety.    FOOTNOTE:    [13] This cope is full of interest in every detail. See M. Louis de  Farcy, _La Broderie du Onzieme Siecle jusqu'a Nos Jours_. Plate II.          CHAPTER XIII    THE GARNITURE OF WORK      Finishing off--Making up--Edges--Use of Cord-making Appliance--Cord    Twisted by Hand--Knotted Cord--Fringes--Tassels--Knots.      When the embroidery is completed, the making up, the addition of  tasteful finishing touches, and such things as fringes, tassels, and  linings, must all be considered. These will, if judiciously made use of,  give a distinction and character to the work that might be missed if due  care and thought were not expended upon such details. This part of the  work might be compared to the garnishing of a boiled fowl with lemon and  parsley, a minor detail, but a very effective one.    It is possible, by the help of such expedients, to emphasise certain  colours and bring out points of the design, as well as to give  completeness and finish. Such things as fringes, cords, and tassels are  often more satisfactory when made by the worker and with materials like  those used in the embroidery, for such will be more likely to be in  keeping with the character of the rest, and to be more interesting in  detail. In the finishing off the same taste and neatness of"]]]
