On August 18 Amadon and Phillips  (1947:579) found _C. m. prosopidicola_ at Las Delicias where \"a fledged  young was noticed begging for food....\" Lowery (1938:4) recorded one  specimen of _C. m. prosopidicola_ from Monclova. Findley saw  Boat-tailed Grackles 2 mi. W Jimenez on June 19, 1952, and 2 mi. S and  11 mi. E Nava on June 15, 1952.    The distribution and intergradation of Boat-tailed Grackles in Coahuila  is presently poorly understood. _C. m. prosopidicola_ from southeastern  Coahuila may approach _C. m. mexicanus_, and there is probable  intergradation of _prosopidicola_ with _monsoni_ in northwestern  Coahuila (Phillips, 1950:78).    _Molothrus ater ater_ (Boddaert).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Female]  31513, from 21 mi. S, 11 mi. E Australia, 4400 ft., May 3, 1954,  measurements: wing, 102 mm.; tail, 64 mm.; tarsus, 26 mm.; culmen, 17  mm.    This subspecies of the Brown-headed Cowbird is uncommon in Coahuila.  Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) took an adult male and a juvenile female  _M. a. ater_ at Las Delicias on August 15, both of which were  considered early migrants. Dickerman obtained No. 31513 from a flock of  eight cowbirds. Although the measurements of this specimen agree  equally well with those of _M. a. ater_ and _M. a. artemisiae_  (Grinnell, 1909:275-281), the shape of the bill most closely resembles  that of _ater_. Grinnell (1909:278) said that \"_ater_ has a tumid bill,  broad and high at [the] base with [a] conspicuously arched culmen\"  whereas \"_artemisiae_ has a longer and relatively much slenderer bill,  vertically shallow at [the] base and laterally compressed, with the  culmen in its greater portion straight or even slightly depressed.\" The  size of the ovary (8x4 mm.) of No. 31513 and the date (May 3) on which  it was obtained suggest that this individual was a late migrant, still  south of the breeding range of _M. a. ater_.    _Molothrus ater artemisiae_ Grinnell.--This subspecies of the  Brown-headed Cowbird is an uncommon migrant in Coahuila. Amadon and  Phillips (1947:579) obtained, at Las Delicias, a juvenile male on  August 15 and an adult male on August 17.    *_Molothrus ater obscurus_ (Gmelin).--_Specimens examined:_ total 18:  [Male] [Male] 32112-32115 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft.,  June 18 and 19, 1952; [Male] [Male] 32108-32111, [Male] 32116, and  [Female] [Female] 32117-32120 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20,  1952; [Female] 32491 from Las Margaritas, August 4, 1955; [Male] 31511  and [Female] 31510 from 16 mi. E, 18 mi. N Ocampo, May 8 and 7, 1952;  and [Male] [Male] 35409-35410 (skeletons only) from 4 mi. N San Isidro,  May 11, 1954.    This subspecies of the Brown-headed Cowbird is common in Coahuila and  breeds there. Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) suggested that _M. a.  obscurus_ breeds at Las Delicias. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206) saw  the Brown-headed Cowbird in \"small numbers on the outskirts of  Saltillo....\"    Measurements of the adult males that I have examined are: wing, 101.1  mm. (97-106); tail, 66.5 mm. (62-69); tarsus, 25.6 mm. (24.5-28);  culmen, 17.3 mm. (16-18.5). Measurements of the adult females that I  have examined are: wing, 92.3 mm. (90-97); tail, 60.1 mm. (56.5-62.5);  tarsus, 23.5 mm. (22.5-24); culmen, 14.4 mm. (14-15). The sizes of the  testes of three of the males (6-7 mm. long) and of the largest ova of  four of the females (6-9 mm. in diameter) indicate breeding by this  subspecies in Coahuila, as does the small size of one of the juvenile  males (tail, 33.5 mm. long).    _Piranga ludoviciana_ (Wilson).--In Coahuila the Western Tanager occurs  fairly commonly as a migrant. There are no records of it breeding in  the State. Miller (1955a:174) remarked that Marsh took a migrant  Western Tanager at Jardin del Sur in the Sierra del Carmen on September  7. Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) took an adult male Western Tanager at  Las Delicias on August 12. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:305) also recorded this tanager from 12 mi. W Saltillo. Dickerman  saw Western Tanagers in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954, and 16 mi.  E and 18 mi. N Ocampo on May 7, 1954.    *_Piranga flava dextra_ Bangs.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male] 31526,  from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May 12, 1954,  weight, 41 gms.    Miller (1955a:174) found this subspecies of the Hepatic Tanager \"in the  pine-oak belt at 7000 feet on April 12 [in the Sierra del Carmen], when  a male was seen and a female taken.\" No. 31526 was with a female when  taken; this male was not fat and its testes were not enlarged. The size  of the wing (105.5 mm.) of No. 31526 represents the extreme maximum in  this subspecies.    _Piranga flava hepatica_ (Swainson).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:303) stated that _P. f. hepatica_ is found in northwestern  and central Arizona and southwestern New Mexico south into the  highlands of Mexico, west of the Sierra Madre Oriental, to Oaxaca and  in winter and migration extends eastward and south to Chiapas. These  authors remarked also that _P. f. dextra_ occurs in the mountains east  of the continental divide in New Mexico and western Texas south through  eastern Mexico to Chiapas. Specimens of the Hepatic Tanager from  Coahuila in winter might well be either _P. f. hepatic_ or _P. f.  dextra_. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (_loc. cit._) recorded  migrants of _P. f. hepatica_ from the Sierra de Guadalupe on April  24-27.    *_Piranga rubra rubra_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimens examined:_ total 6:  [Male] 32129, [Male] 32132, and [Female] 32133 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W  Jimenez, 850 ft., June 18 and 19, 1952; [Male] 32130 from 2 mi. W  Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952; and [Male] 32131 and [Female] 32134  from 2 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nava, June 15, 1952.    This Summer Tanager occurs in northeastern Coahuila. The specimens from  12 mi. N and 12 mi. W Jimenez, 2 mi. W Jimenez, and 2 mi. S and 11 mi.  E Nava are typical representatives of _P. r. rubra_. The large testes  (12 mm.) of No. 32129 and the well-developed brood patch of No. 32134  are evidence of breeding by this subspecies in the State. Heretofore  this subspecies has not been recorded from Coahuila.    *_Piranga rubra cooperi_ Ridgway.--_Specimens examined:_ total 4:  [Male] [Male] 32828-32829, [Male] 32831, and [Female] 32830 from  Parras, July 4, 1955.    This subspecies of Summer Tanager seems to occur throughout Coahuila  except in the northeastern section of the State. Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:302) listed _P. r. cooperi_ from Sabinas and  Sierra de Guadalupe. Miller (1955a:174) saw a Summer Tanager in a  canyon in the Serranias de Burros, about 40 miles east of the Sierra  del Carmen on April 28. Although there are no other records of _P. r.  cooperi_ from northwestern Coahuila, Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:96)  recorded this tanager as a common nesting species in Brewster County,  Texas, in cottonwood, mesquite, or willow trees. I suspect that _P. r.  cooperi_ is a common nesting bird in northwestern Coahuila as well.    Nos. 32828-32831 approach _P. r. rubra_. The measurements of No. 32829  are: wing, 98 mm.; tail, 80 mm.; the measurements of No. 32831 are:  wing, 98 mm.; tail, 79 mm. The specimens of _P. r. cooperi_ from Parras  are somewhat small and seemingly approach _P. r. rubra_. The sizes of  the testes (8x5 mm.; 9x5 mm.) of Nos. 32829 and 32831, respectively,  and the size of the largest ovum (4x4 mm.) of No. 32830 indicate  breeding by this subspecies in southern Coahuila, as does the presence  of No. 32828, a juvenile male.    *_Richmondena cardinalis canicaudus_ (Chapman).--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: [Male] 31099 from 1 mi. N Boquillas, 700 ft., March 8, 1952,  weight, 45.3 gms.; [Male] 32135 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20,  1952; and [Male] 32136 from 2 mi. S, 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, June  22, 1952.    In Coahuila the Cardinal is common. Miller (1955a:174) found it singing  in the Boquillas drainage of the Sierra del Carmen at 4800 feet, and  gave evidence that the Cardinal breeds there. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:43) found the species to be common in the low country \"east of  Saltillo.\" Hellmayr (1938:69) recorded _R. c. canicaudus_ from Sabinas.  The sizes of the testes (9 mm.; 7x4 mm.) of Nos. 32135-32136 indicate  breeding by this subspecies in northeastern Coahuila.    *_Pyrrhuloxia sinuata sinuata_ (Bonaparte).--_Specimens examined:_  total 4: [Male] 31100 from 10 mi. S, 5 mi. E Boquillas, 1500 ft., March  4, 1952, weight, 37.3 gms.; [Male] 32137 from 5 mi. N, 19 mi. W Cuatro  Cienegas, 3250 ft., July 5, 1952; [Male] 35403 (skeleton only) from San  Marcos, May 5, 1954; and [Male] 30234 from 3 mi. SE Torreon, 3800 ft.,  January 12, 1951.    In Coahuila, the Pyrrhuloxia is common. Hellmayr (1938:76) listed it  from Sabinas. Ridgway (1901:628) recorded _P. s. texana_ (=_sinuata_)  from La Ventura. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206) found the species \"only  in the open desert country west of Saltillo where, on April 22, several  pairs were seen in a small arroyo.\" Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) took  an immature _P. s. sinuata_ at Las Delicias; Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:43-44) found this subspecies fairly common in the San Pedro  district on January 29 and 30. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:330) recorded breeding by _P. s. sinuata_ at Hipolito on July 2.  The size of the testes (8 mm.) of No. 32137 indicates breeding in  central Coahuila.    *_Pheucticus melanocephalus melanocephalus_ (Swainson).--_Specimen  examined:_ one, [Male] 31664, from Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5 mi. W  General Cepeda), 7500 ft., April 30, 1953, measurements: wing, 105.5  mm.; tail, 78 mm.; culmen, 19 mm.; weight, 48 gms.    Miller (1955a:174) reported that the Black-headed Grosbeak first  appeared in the Sierra del Carmen on April 13 and was soon seen  patrolling territories. He remarked that these specimens from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26117"],[0,"Sketches of the Fair Sex, in All Parts of the World.

That your own superiority should always be seen, but never felt, seems  an excellent general rule. A wife should outshine her husband in  nothing, not even in her dress. The bane of married happiness among the  city men in general has been, that finding themselves unfit for polite  life, they transferred their vanity to their ladies, dressed them up  gaily, and sent them out a gallanting, while the good man was to regale  with port wine or rum punch, perhaps among mean companions, after the  compting house was shut. This practice produced the ridicule thrown on  them in all our comedies and novels since commerce began to prosper. But  now that I am so near the subject, a word or two on jealousy may not be  amiss; for though not a failing of the present age's growth, yet the  seeds of it are too certainly sown in every warm bosom, for us to  neglect it as a fault of no consequence. If you are ever tempted to be  jealous, watch your wife narrowly--but never tease her; tell her your  jealousy but conceal your suspicion; let her, in short, be satisfied  that it is only your odd temper, and even troublesome attachment, that  makes you follow her; but let her not dream that you ever doubted  seriously of her virtue even for a moment. If she is disposed towards  jealousy of you, let me beseech you to be always explicit with her and  never mysterious: be above delighting in her pain, of all things--nor do  your business nor pay your visits with an air of concealment, when all  you are doing might as well be proclaimed perhaps in the parish vestry.  But I hope better than this of your tenderness and of your virtue, and  will release you from a lecture you have so little need of, unless your  extreme youth and my uncommon regard will excuse it. And now farewell;  make my kindest compliments to your wife, and be happy in proportion as  happiness is wished you by, Dear Sir, &c.      GARRICK'S ADVICE TO MARRIED LADIES.      Ye fair married dames who so often deplore    That a lover once blest is a lover no more;    Attend to my counsel, nor blush to be taught    That prudence must cherish what beauty has caught.      The bloom on your cheek, and the glance of your eye,    Your roses and lilies may make the men sigh;    But roses, and lilies, and sighs pass away,    And passion will die as your beauties decay.      Use the man that you wed like your fav'rite guitar,    Though music in both, they are both apt to jar;    How tuneful and soft from a delicate touch,    Not handled too roughly, nor play'd on too much!      The sparrow and linnet will feed from your hand,    Grow tame by your kindness, and come at command:    Exert with your husband the same happy skill,    For hearts, like your birds, may be tamed to your will.      Be gay and good-humour'd, complying and kind,    Turn the chief of your care from your face to your mind;    'Tis thus that a wife may her conquests improve,    And Hymen shall rivet the fetters of love.      ORIGIN OF NUNNERIES.    Soon after the introduction of Christianity, St. Mark is said to have  founded a society called Therapeutes, who dwelt by the lake Moeris in  Egypt, and devoted themselves to solitude and religious offices. About  the year 305 of the christian computation, St. Anthony being persecuted  by Dioclesian, retired into the desert near the lake Moeris; numbers of  people soon followed his example, joined themselves to the Therapeutes;  St. Anthony being placed at their head, and improving upon their rules,  first formed them into regular monasteries, and enjoined them to live  in mortification and chastity. About the same time, or soon after,  St. Synclitica, resolving not to be behind St. Anthony in her zeal for  chastity, is generally believed to have collected together a number of  enthusiastic females, and to have founded the first nunnery for their  reception. Some imagine the scheme of celibacy was concerted between  St. Anthony and St. Synclitica, as St. Anthony, on his first retiring  into solitude, is said to have put his sister into a nunnery, which must  have been that of St. Synclitica; but however this be, from their  institution, monks and nuns increased so fast, that in the city of  Orixa, about seventeen years after the death of St. Anthony, there were  twenty thousand virgins devoted to celibacy.    Such at this time was the rage of celibacy; a rage which, however  unnatural, will cease to excite our wonder, when we consider, that it  was accounted by both sexes the sure and only infallible road to heaven  and eternal happiness; and as such, it behoved the church vigorously to  maintain and countenance it, which she did by beginning about this time  to deny the liberty of marriage to her sons. In the first council of  Nice, held soon after the introduction of christianity, the celibacy of  the clergy was strenuously argued for, and some think that even in an  earlier period it had been the subject of debate; however this be, it  was not agreed to in the council of Nice, though at the end of the  fourth century it is said that Syricus, bishop of Rome, enacted the  first decree against the marriage of monks; a decree which was not  universally received: for several centuries after, we find that it was  not uncommon for clergymen to have wives; even the popes were allowed  this liberty, as it is said in some of the old statutes of the church,  that it was lawful for the pope to marry a virgin for the sake of  having children. So exceedingly difficult is it to combat against  nature, that little regard seems to have been paid to this decree of  Syricus; for we are informed, that several centuries after, it was no  uncommon thing for the clergy to have wives, and perhaps even a  plurality of them; as we find it among the ordonnances of pope  Sylvester, that every priest should be the husband of one wife only; and  Pius the Second affirmed, that though many strong reasons might be  adduced in support of the celibacy of the clergy, there were still  stronger reasons against it.      DESCRIPTION OF THE GREAT CONVENT AT AJUDA IN RIO JANERIO.    At the end of the chapel is a large quadrangle, entered by a massive  gateway, surrounded by three stories of grated windows. Here female  negro pedlars come with their goods, and expose them in the court-yard  below. The nuns, from their grated windows above, see what they like,  and, letting down a cord, the article is fastened to it; it is then  drawn up and examined, and, if approved of, the price is let down. Some  that I saw in the act of buying and selling in this way, were very  merry, joking and laughing with the blacks below, and did not seem at  all indisposed to do the same with my companion. In three of the lower  windows, on a level with the court-yard, are revolving cupboards, like  half-barrels, and at the back of each is a plate of tin, perforated like  the top of a nutmeg-grater. The nuns of this convent are celebrated for  making sweet confectionary, which people purchase. There is a bell which  the purchaser applies to, and a nun peeps through the perforated tin;  she then lays the dish on a shelf of the revolving cupboard, and turns  it inside out; the dish is taken, the price laid in its place, and it is  turned in. While we stood there, the invisible lady-warder asked for a  pinch of snuff; the box was laid down in the same way, and turned in and  out.      CEREMONY OF THE INITIATION OF A NUN.    The disposition to take the veil, even among young girls, is not  uncommon in Brazil. The opposition of friends can prevent it, until they  are twenty five years old; but after that time they are considered  competent to decide for themselves. A writer describes the initiation of  a young lady, whose wealthy parents were extremely reluctant to have her  take the vow. She held a lighted torch in her hand, in imitation of the  prudent virgins; and when the priest chanted, \"Your spouse approaches;  come forth and meet him,\" she approached the altar singing, \"I follow  with my whole heart;\" and, accompanied by two nuns already professed,  she knelt before the bishop. She seemed very lovely, with an unusually  sweet, gentle, and pensive countenance. She did not look particularly or  deeply affected; but when she sung her responses, there was something  exceedingly mournful in the soft, tremulous, and timid tones of her  voice. The bishop now exhorted her to make a public profession of her  vows before the congregation, and said, \"Will you persevere in your  purpose of holy chastity?\" She blushed deeply, and, with a downcast  look, lowly, but firmly answered, \"I will.\" He again said, more  distinctly, \"Do you promise to preserve it?\" and she replied more  emphatically, \"I do promise.\" The bishop then said, \"Thanks be to God;\"  and she bent forward and reverently kissed his hand, while he asked her,  \"Will you be blest and consecrated?\" She replied, \"Oh! I wish it.\"    The habiliments, in which she was hereafter to be clothed, were  sanctified by the aspersion of holy water: then followed several prayers  to God, that \"As he had blessed the garments of Aaron, with ointment  which flowed from his head to his beard, so he would now bless the  garments of his servant, with the copious dew of his benediction.\" When  the garment was thus blessed, the girl retired with it; and having laid  aside the dress in which she had appeared, she returned, arrayed in her  new attire, except her veil. A gold ring was next provided, and  consecrated with a prayer, that she who wore it \"might be fortified with  celestial virtue, to preserve a pure faith, and incorrupt fidelity to  her spouse, Jesus Christ.\" He last took the veil, and her female  attendants having uncovered her head, he threw it over her, so that it  fell on her"]]]
