[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#19)"],[1," was the first affair of the kind I had been  present at, and I was somewhat curious as to the mode of carrying it on.  My companion and inductor was a certain `Uncle Abe,' a gentleman very  much after the style and complexion of our own Jake here.    \"I need not tell you, gentlemen, that throughout the Western States  every neighbourhood has its noted 'coon-hunter.  He is usually a wary  old `nigger,' who knows all the tricks and dodges of the 'coon.  He  either owns a dog himself, or has trained one of his master's, in that  peculiar line.  It is of little importance what breed the dog may be.  I  have known curs that were excellent `'coon-dogs.'  All that is wanted  is, that he have a good nose, and that he be a good runner, and of  sufficient bulk to be able to bully a 'coon when taken.  This a very  small dog cannot do, as the 'coon frequently makes a desperate fight  before yielding.  Mastiffs, terriers, and half-bred pointers make the  best `'coon-dogs.'    \"Uncle Abe was the mighty hunter, the Nimrod of the neighbourhood in  which I happened to be; and Uncle Abe's dog--a stout terrier--was  esteemed the `smartest 'coon-dog' in a circle of twenty miles.  In going  out with Uncle Abe, therefore, I had full confidence that I should see  sport.    \"On one side of the plantation was a heavily-timbered `bottom', through  which meandered a small stream, called, of course, a `creek.'  This  bottom was a favourite _habitat_ of the 'coons, as there were large  trees growing near the water, many of which were hollow either in their  trunks or some of their huge limbs.  Moreover, there were vast trellises  of vines extending from tree to tree; some of them, as the fox and  muscadine (_Vitis Labrusca_), yielding sweet grapes, of which the  raccoons are very fond.    \"To this bottom, then, we directed our course, Abe acting as guide, and  holding his dog, Pompo, in the leash Abe carried no other weapon than an  axe, while I had armed myself with a double-barrel.  Pompo knew as well  as either of us the errand on which we were bent, as appeared from his  flashing eyes and the impatient leaps which he now and then made to get  free.    \"We had to cross a large corn-field, a full half-mile in breadth, before  we reached the woods.  Between this and the timber was a zigzag fence--  the common `rail' fence of the American farmer.  For some distance  beyond the fence the timber was small, but farther on was the creek  `bottom,' where the 'coons were more likely to make their  dwelling-place.    \"We did not, however, proceed direct to the bottom.  Abe knew better  than that.  The young corn was just then `in the milk,' and the  'coon-hunter expected to find his game nearer the field.  It was  settled, therefore, that we should follow the line of the fence, in  hopes that the dog would strike a fresh trail, leading either to or from  the corn-field.    \"It was now night--two hours after sundown.  The 'coon-chase, I have  already said, is a nocturnal sport.  The raccoon does range by day, but  rarely, and only in dark and solitary woods.  He often basks by day upon  high limbs, or the broken tops, of trees.  I have shot several of his  tribe while asleep, or sunning themselves in such situations.  Perhaps  before they knew their great enemy man, they were less nocturnal in  their activity.  We had a fine moonlight; but so far as a view of the  chase was concerned, that would benefit us but little.  During the hunt  there is not much to be seen of either dog or 'coon, as it is always a  scramble through trees and underwood.  The dog trusts altogether to his  nose, and the hunter to his ears; for the latter has no other guide save  the yelp or bark of his canine assistant.  Nevertheless, moonlight, or a  clear night, is indispensable; without one or the other, it would be  impossible to follow through the woods.  A view of a 'coon-chase is a  luxury enjoyed only by the hats and owls.    \"Pompo was now let loose in the corn; while Abe and I walked quietly  along the fence, keeping on different sides.  Abe remained in the field  for the purpose of handing over the dog, as the fence was high--a  regular `ten rail, with stalks and riders.'  A 'coon could easily cross  it, but not a dog, without help.    \"We had not gone more than a hundred yards, when a quick sharp yelp from  Pompo announced that he had come suddenly upon something in the  corn-field.    \"`A varmint!' cried Abe; and the next moment appeared the dog, running  up full tilt among the maize plants and up to the fence.  I could see  some dark object before him, that passed over the rails with a sudden  spring, and bounded into the timbers.    \"`A varmint, massa!' repeated Abe, as he lifted the dog over, and  followed himself.    \"I knew that in Abe's vocabulary--for that night at least--a `varmint'  meant a 'coon; and as we dashed through the brushwood, following the  dog, I felt all the excitement of a 'coon-chase.    \"It was not a long one--I should think of about five minutes' duration;  at the end of which time the yelp of the dog which had hitherto guided  us, changed into a regular and continuous harking.  On hearing this, Abe  quietly announced--    \"`The varmint am treed.'    \"Our only thought now was to get to the tree as speedily as possible,  but another thought entered our minds as we advanced; that was, what  sort of a tree had the 'coon taken shelter in?    \"This was an important question, and its answer involved the success or  failure of our hunt.  If a very large tree, we might whistle for the  'coon.  Abe knew this well, and as we passed on, expressed his doubts  about the result.    \"The bark of Pompo sounded some hundred yards off, in the very heaviest  of the bottom timber.  It was not likely, therefore, that the 'coon had  taken to a small tree, while there were large ones near at hand.  Our  only hope was that he had climbed one that was not `hollow.'  In that  case we might still have a chance with the double-barrel and buck-shot.  Abe had but little hope.    \"`He hab reach him own tree, massa; an' that am sartin to be a big un  wi' a hole near um top.  Wagh! 'twar dat ar fence.  But for de dratted  fence ole Pomp nebber let um reach um own tree.  Wagh!'    \"From this I learned that one point in the character of a good 'coon-dog  was speed.  The 'coon runs well for a few hundred yards.  He rarely  strays farther from his lair.  If he can beat his pursuer for this  distance he is safe, as his retreat is always in a hollow tree of great  size.  There is no way of getting at him there, except by felling the  tree, and this the most zealous 'coon-hunter would not think of  attempting.  The labour of cutting down such a tree would be worth a  dozen 'coons.  A swift dog, therefore, will overtake the raccoon, and  force him to the nearest tree--often a small one, where he is either  shaken off or the tree cut down.  Sometimes the hunter climbs after and  forces him to leap out, so as to fall into the very jaws of the watchful  dog below.    \"In Abe's opinion Pompo would have `treed' his 'coon before reaching,  the bottom, had not the fence interfered, but now--    \"`Told ye so, massa!' muttered he, interrupting my thoughts.  `Look dar!  dar's de tree--trunk thick as a haystack.  Wagh!'    \"I looked in the direction indicated by my companion.  I saw Pompo  standing by the root of a very large tree, looking upward, shaking his  tail, and barking at intervals.  Before I had time to make any farther  observations Abe's voice again sounded in my ears.    \"`Gollies! it am a buttonwood!  Why, Pomp, ole fellur, you hab made a  mistake--de varmint ain't dar, 'Cooney nebber trees upon buttonwood--  nebber--you oughter know better'n dat, ole fool!'    \"Abe's speech drew my attention to the tree.  I saw that it was the  American sycamore (_Platanus Occidentalis_), familiarly known by the  trivial name, `buttonwood,' from the use to which its wood is sometimes  put.  But why should the 'coon not `tree' upon it, as well as any other?  I put the question to my companion.    \"`'Cause, massa, its bark am slickery.  De varmint nebber takes to 'im.  He likes de oak, an' de poplum, an' de scaly-bark.  Gosh! but he am  dar!' continued Abe, raising his voice, and looking outward--`Look  yonder, massa!  He had climb by de great vine.  Dat's right, Pomp! you  am right after all, and dis nigga's a fool.  Hee--up, ole dog! hee--up!'    \"Following the direction in which Abe pointed, my eyes rested on a huge  parasite of the lliana kind, that, rising out of the ground at some  distance, slanted upward and joined the sycamore near its top.  This had  no doubt been the ladder by which the 'coon had climbed.    \"This discovery, however, did not mend the matter as far as we were  concerned.  The 'coon had got into the buttonwood, fifty feet from the  ground, where the tree had been broken off by the lightning or the wind,  and where the mouth of a large cavity was distinctly visible by the  light of the moon.  The trunk was one of the largest, and it would have  been sheer folly (so we concluded) to have attempted felling it.    \"We left the spot without farther ado, and took our way back to the  corn-field.    \"The dog had now been silent for some time, and we were in hopes that  another `varmint' might have stolen into the corn.    \"Our hopes were not doomed to disappointment.  Pompo had scarcely  entered the field when a second 'coon was sprung, which, like the other,  ran directly for the fence and the woods.    \"Pomp followed as fast as he could be flung over; and this 'coon was  also `treed' in a few minutes.    \"From the direction of the barking, we calculated that it must be near  where the other had escaped us; but our astonishment equalled our  chagrin, when upon arriving at the spot, we found that both the  `varmints' had taken to the same tree!    \"With some rather emphatic ejaculations we returned to the corn-field,  and after a short while a third 'coon was raised,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#19)"],[1,"ry.    Brother Stewart soon preached himself out in his relatives'  neighborhood. He heard of my success, and came to me. He said  that the people where he had been preaching were an unbelieving  set. I introduced him to the members of my congregation, and had  him preach with me a few times, which gratified him very much.    One Sunday we were to administer the ordinance of baptism.  Several candidates were in attendance. Brother Stewart was quite  anxious to baptize the people. I was willing to humor him. So I  said:    \"My friends, Brother Stewart, a priest of the New Dispensation,  will administer the ordinance of baptism.\"    The people stood still; none would come forward for him to  baptize them. They said they would not be baptized until I would  baptize them myself. I told them I would act if they desired it.  So I baptized the people, and Brother Stewart was much offended  with them. He had not yet learned that he that exalteth himself  shall be cast down, and he that humbleth himself shall be  exalted. I then called on the people for a contribution, to get  some clothing for Brother Stewart. I had concluded to have him  return home, and wished to reclothe him before he started, for he  was then in need of it. The contribution was more liberal than I  expected.    After Brother Stewart departed I stayed there some three weeks.  Then I made up my mind to go home and visit my family. Brother  Sanders invited me to go to Gainsborough with him, whore he  presented me with a nice supply of clothing. Sister Sanders  presented me with a fine horse, saddle, and bridle, and twelve  dollars in money. The congregation gave me fifty dollars, and I  had from them an outfit worth over three hundred dollars. I at  first refused to accept the horse, but Sister Sanders appeared so  grieved at this that I finally took it. I left my congregation in  charge of Elder Julien Moses, and started for my family about the  1st of October, 1839. I promised to call on my flock the next  spring, or send a suitable minister to wait upon them.    When I reached Vandalia I found my family well. God had raised up  friends for them in my absence. The Saints were then gathering at  Commerce, that is to say Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois. I  visited my sister's family that fall; they then lived about one  hundred miles north of Vandalia. I preached often through Central  Illinois, and that fall I baptized all of my wife's family,  except her father. He held out and refused the gospel until he  was on his deathbed; then he demanded baptism, but being in a  country place he died ere an elder could be procured to baptize  him. By the rules of our Church a person can be baptized for the  dead, and later he was saved to eternal life by the baptism of  one of his children for the salvation of his soul.        CHAPTER VIII - LEE AS A MISSIONARY    Shortly after my return to Illinois I built a house for my  family. During the winter I entered into a trading and trafficking  business with G. W. Hickerson. We would go over the country and  buy up chickens, butter, feathers, beeswax, and coon skins, and  haul them to St. Louis, and carry back calicoes and other goods  in payment for the articles first purchased. We made some money  that way.    While carrying on this trade I drew the remainder of my money  from my friend, Vanleven, and began my preparations for joining  the Saints. About the middle of April, 1840, I succeeded in  securing a good outfit, and with my old friend Stewart again  joined the Saints at Nauvoo. I felt it to be God's will that I  must obey the orders of the Prophet, hence my return to the  society of the brethren.    Joseph and his two counselors, his brother Hyrum and Sidney  Rigdon had been released from jail in Richmond, Missouri, and  were again at the head of the Church and directing the energies  of the brethren. It was the policy of Joseph to hold the city  lots in Nauvoo at a high price, so as to draw money from the  rich, but not so high as to prevent the poor from obtaining  homes. The poor who lost all their property in following the  Church were presented with a lot free in the center of the city.  The Prophet told them not to sell their lots for less than eight  hundred to one thousand dollars, but to sell for that when  offered; then they could take a cheaper lot in the outskirts of  the city and have money left to fix up comfortably.    All classes, Jews and Gentiles, were allowed to settle there, one  man's money being as good as another's. No restrictions were  placed on the people; they had the right to trade with anyone  that suited them. All classes attended meetings, dances,  theaters, and other gatherings, and were permitted to eat and  drink together. The outsiders were invited to join in all of our  amusements. Ball was a favorite sport with the men, and the  Prophet frequently took a hand in the game. He appeared to treat  all men alike, and never condemned a man until he had given him a  fair trial to show what was in him.    Among the first things was the laying of the foundation of the  Temple. When this was done each man was required to do one day's  work in every ten days, in quarrying rock or doing other work for  the structure. A company was sent up the Mississippi River to the  Pineries to get out lumber for the Temple and other public  buildings. The money for city lots went into the Church treasury  to purchase materials for the Temple which could not be supplied  by the Saints' own labor.    At the conference in April, 1840, the Prophet delivered a lengthy  address upon the history and condition of the Saints. He reminded  the brethren that all had suffered alike for the sake of the  gospel. The rich and the poor had been brought to a common level  by persecution; many of the brethren owed debts that they had  been forced to contract in order to get out of Missouri alive. He  considered it unchristianlike for the brethren to demand the  payment of such debts; he did not wish to screen anyone from the  just payment of his debts, but he did think that it would be for  the glory of the Kingdom if the people, of their own will, freely  forgave each other all their existing indebtedness, one to the  other, renew their covenants with Almighty God and with each  other, refrain from evil, and live their religion. By this means  God's Holy Spirit would support and bless the people.    The people were then asked if they were in favor of thus bringing  about the year of jubilee. All that felt so inclined were asked  to make it known by raising their hands; every hand in the  audience was raised. The Prophet declared all debts of the  Saints, to and from each other, forgiven and wiped out. He then  gave the following words of advice to the people:    \"I wish you all to know that because you were justified in taking  property from your enemies, while engaged in war in Missouri,  which was needed to support you, there is now a different  condition of things. We are no longer at war, and you must stop  stealing. When the right time comes we will go in force and take  the whole State of Missouri. It belongs to us as our inheritance;  but I want no more petty stealing. A man that will steal petty  articles from his enemies will, when occasion offers, steal from  his brethren too. Now I command you, that you who have stolen  must steal no more. I ask all the brethren to renew their  covenants, and start anew to live their religion. If you will do  this, I will forgive you your past sins.\"    The vote was taken on this proposition, and resulted in the  unanimous decision of the people to act as requested by the  Prophet. He then continued, saying that he never professed to be  a perfect man.    \"I have my failings and passions to contend with the same as has  the greatest stranger to God. I am tempted the same as you are,  my brethren. I am not infallible. All men are subject to  temptation, but they are not justified in yielding to their  passions and sinful natures. There is a constant warfare between  the two natures of man. This is the warfare of the Saints. It is  written that the Lord would have a tried people - a people that  would be tried as gold is tried by the fire, even seven times  tried and purified from the dross of unrighteousness. The chances  of all men for salvation are equal. True, some have greater  capacity than others, yet the chances for improving our minds and  subduing our passions by denying ourselves to all unrighteousness  and cultivating the principles of purity are the same; they are  within the reach of every man; all have their free agency; all  can lay hold of the promises of eternal life, if they will only  be faithful and comply with God's will and obey the Priesthood in  these last days. Never betray anyone, for God hates a traitor,  and so do I. Stand by each other; never desert a friend,  especially in the hour of trouble. Remember that our reward  consists in doing good acts, and not in long prayers like the  Scribes and Pharisees of old, who prayed to be seen of men. Never  mind what men think of you, if your hearts are right before God.  It is written, 'Do unto others as you would that others should  do unto you.' The first commandment is, 'Thou shalt love the  Lord thy God with all thy heart, mind, and strength.' The second  commandment is, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' Upon  these two hang all the law and the prophets.\"    To more deeply impress these truths upon the minds of his people  the Prophet gave them an account of the man who fell among  thieves and was relieved by the stranger; and he also taught us  from the Scriptures, as well as by the revelations that he had  received from God, that it is humane acts and deeds of kindness,  justice and words of truth, that are accounted to man for  righteousness; that prayers, made to be heard by men, and  hypocritical groans are displeasing to God.    The Prophet talked to us plainly, and fully"]]]
