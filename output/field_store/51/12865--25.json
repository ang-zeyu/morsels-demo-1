When he was in a good humor and I was carrying something agreeable to  him, then my mother-in-law would snatch it out of my hands. She would  carry it herself. As he thought I was not so careful and studious to  please him he would fly in a rage against me and express great  thankfulness to his mother. I used all my skill and endeavors to gain  my mother-in-law's favor by my presents, my services; but could not  succeed.    \"How bitter and grievous, O my God, would such a life be were it not  for Thee! Thou hast sweetened and reconciled it to me.\" I had a few  short intervals from this severe and mortifying life. These served only  to make the reverses more keen and bitter.          CHAPTER 18      About eight or nine months after my recovery from the smallpox, Father  La Combe, passing by our house, brought me a letter from Father de la  Motte, recommending him to my esteem, and expressing the highest  friendship for him. I hesitated because I was very loath to make new  acquaintances. The fear of offending my brother prevailed. After a  short conversation we both desired a farther opportunity. I thought  that he either loved God, or was disposed to love Him, and I wished  everybody to love Him. God had already made use of me for the  conversion of three of his order. The strong desire he had of seeing me  again induced him to come to our country house about half a league from  the town. A little incident which happened opened a way for me to speak  to him. As he was in discourse with my husband, who relished his  company, he was taken ill and retired into the garden. My husband bade  me go and see what was the matter. He told me he had noticed in my  countenance a deep inwardness and presence of God, which had given him  a strong desire of seeing me again. God then assisted me to open to him  the interior path of the soul, and conveyed so much grace to him  through this poor channel, that he went away changed into quite another  man. I preserved an esteem for him; for it appeared to me that he would  be devoted to God; but little did I then foresee, that I should ever be  led to the place where he was to reside.    My disposition at this time was a continual prayer, without knowing it  to be such. The presence of God was so plentifully given that it seemed  to be more in me than my very self. The sensibility thereof was so  powerful, so penetrating, it seemed to me irresistible. Love took from  me all liberty of my own. At other times I was so dry, I felt nothing  but the pain of absence, which was the keener to me, as the divine  presence had before been so sensible. In these alternatives I forgot  all my troubles and pains. It appeared to me as if I had never  experienced any. In its absence, it seemed as if it would never return  again. I still thought it was through some fault of mine it was  withdrawn, and that rendered me inconsolable. Had I known it had been a  state through which it was necessary to pass, I should not have been  troubled. My strong love to the will of God would have rendered  everything easy to me. The property of this prayer was to give a great  love to the order of God, with so sublime and perfect a reliance on  Him, as to fear nothing, whether danger, thunders, spirits, or death.  It gives a great abstraction from one's self, our own interests and  reputation, with an utter disregard to everything of the kind--all  being swallowed up in the esteem of the will of God.    At home, I was accused of everything that was ill done, spoiled or  broken. At first I told the truth, and said it was not I. They  persisted, and accused me of lying. I then made no reply. Besides, they  told all their tales to such as came to the house. But when I was  afterward alone with the same persons, I never undeceived them. I often  heard such things said of me, before my friends, as were enough to make  them entertain a bad opinion. My heart kept its habitation in the tacit  consciousness of my own innocence, not concerning myself whether they  thought well or ill of me; excluding all the world, all opinions or  censures, out of my view, I minded nothing else but the friendship of  God.    If through infidelity I happened at any time to justify myself, I  always failed, and drew upon myself new crosses, both within and  without. But notwithstanding all this, I was so enamored with it, that  the greatest cross of all would have been to be without any. When the  cross was taken from me for any short space, it seemed to me that it  was because of the bad use I made of it; that my unfaithfulness  deprived me of so great an advantage. I never knew its value better  than its loss.    I cried punish me any way, but take not the cross from me. This amiable  cross returned to me with so much the more weight, as my desire was  more vehement. I could not reconcile two things, they appeared to me so  very opposite. 1) To desire the cross with so much ardor. 2) To support  it with so much difficulty and pain.    God knows well, in the admirable economy he observes, how to render the  crosses more weighty, conformable to the ability of the creature to  bear them. Hereby my soul began to be more resigned, to comprehend that  the state of absence, and of wanting what I longed for, was in its turn  more profitable than that of always abounding. This latter nourished  self-love. If God did not act thus, the soul would never die to itself.  That principle of self-love is so crafty and dangerous, that it cleaves  to everything.    What gave me most uneasiness, in this time of darkness and crucifixion,  both within and without, was an inconceivable readiness to be quick and  hasty. When any answer a little too lively escaped me, (which served  not a little to humble me,) they said \"I was fallen into a mortal sin.\"  A conduct no less rigorous than this was quite necessary for me. I was  so proud, passionate, and of a humor naturally thwarting, wanting  always to carry matters my own way, thinking my own reasons better than  those of others. Hadst thou, O my God, spared the strokes of thy  hammer, I should never have been formed to Thy will, to be an  instrument for Thy use; for I was ridiculously vain. Applause rendered  me intolerable. I praised my friends to excess, and blamed others  without reason. But, the more criminal I have been, the more I am  indebted to Thee, and the less of any good can I attribute to myself.  How blind are men who attribute to others the holiness that God gives  them! I believe, my God, that thou hast had children, who under thy  grace, owed much to their own fidelity. As for me, I owe all to Thee; I  glory to confess it; I cannot acknowledge it too much.    In acts of charity I was very assiduous. So great was my tenderness for  the poor, that I wished to have supplied all their wants. I could not  see their necessity without reproaching myself for the plenty I  enjoyed. I deprived myself of all I could to help them. The very best  at my table was distributed. There were few of the poor where I lived,  who did not partake of my liberality. It seemed as if Thou hadst made  me thy only almoner there, for being refused by others, they came to  me. I cried, \"it is Thy substance; I am only the steward. I ought to  distribute it according to Thy will.\" I found means to relieve them  without letting myself be known, because I had one who dispensed my  alms privately. When there were families who were ashamed to take it in  this way, I sent it to them as if I owed them a debt. I clothed such as  were naked, and caused young girls to be taught how to earn their  livelihood, especially those who were handsome; to the end that being  employed, and having whereon to live, they might not be under a  temptation to throw themselves away. God made use of me to reclaim  several from their disorderly lives. I went to visit the sick, to  comfort them, to make their beds. I made ointments, dressed their  wounds, buried their dead. I privately furnished tradesmen and  mechanics wherewith to keep up their shops. My heart was much opened  toward my fellow creatures in distress. Few indeed could carry charity  much farther than our Lord enabled me to do, according to my state,  both while married and since.    To purify me the more from the mixture I might make of His gifts with  my own self-love, He gave me interior probations, which were very  heavy. I began to experience an insupportable weight, in that very  piety which had formerly been so easy and delightful to me; not that I  did not love it extremely, but I found myself defective in that noble  practice of it. The more I loved it, the more I labored to acquire what  I saw failed in. But, alas! I seemed continually to be overcome by that  which was the contrary to it. My heart, indeed, was detached from all  sensual pleasures. For these several years past, it has seemed to me  that my mind is so detached and absent from the body, that I do things  as if I did them not. If I eat, or refresh myself, it is done with such  an absence, or separation, as I wonder at, with an entire mortification  of the keenness of sensation in all the natural functions.          CHAPTER 19      To resume my history, the smallpox had so much hurt one of my eyes,  that it was feared I would lose it. The gland at the corner of my eye  was injured. An imposthume arose from time to time between the nose and  the eye, which gave me great pain till it was lanced. It swelled all my  head to that degree that I could not bear even a pillow. The least  noise was agony to me, though sometimes they made a great commotion in  my chamber. Yet this was a precious time to me, for two reasons. First,  because I was left in bed alone, where I had a sweet retreat without  interruption; the other, because it answered the desire I had for  suffering,--which desire was so great, that all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],[0,"An American Suffragette (#19)"],[1,"of her apartment on East 56th Street with a box of candied  fruit on the table near her, which had just been opened, and which,  according to the postmark stamped on the paper enclosing the box, had  been mailed to her from Boston. Written on thin paper that was so  pasted as to cover the entire top of the box was the inscription, \"With  best wishes to you and Alice. J. E.\"    A weird description of the lifelike appearance of the woman when found,  seated in her chair, with eyes staring and pupils dilated, was given in  the best reportorial style. The coroner had taken possession of  everything and had ordered the apartment sealed until an inquest could  be held. Whether or not the candied fruit had anything to do with the  death, and if so who could have sent it, were all matters of speculation  which the various writers had covered in from one to four columns,  according to their respective imaginative qualities and newspaper  instinct, but none of them gave the slightest intimation as to the  suspected person, if murder really had been committed.    More or less accurate likenesses of Mrs. Bell were given with all the  events of her life that seemed spectacular, the most prominent of which  was that her neighbors had long speculated as to her source of  livelihood, since her husband's death some four years previously, and  with characteristic charity such speculation led to hints along  salacious trails and the dark recesses of public suspicion. The events  of the injury to her little girl, and her treatment by Dr. Earl, and  the devotion of the volunteer nurse, lacked nothing in their interesting  narration in connection with the supposed murder mystery, and assisted  very materially in enhancing that mystery through the glamour of  prominent personages who were so well in the foreground of the story.    The coroner's jury sat upon the case as coroners' juries have been  sitting upon similar cases ever since English jurisprudence advanced to  the stage of not executing people on suspicion. There was the same dank,  solemn atmosphere of the morgue, the same density of intellect and  understanding, the same owl-like gaze of stupidity that passed muster  for wisdom, the same perfervid desire to get a certificate on the public  treasury without undue mental or physical effort, the same ambition to  give a duly impressive but harmless verdict, that must have  characterized the first empaneled jury of this nature. Never by any  possibility could these original qualities have deteriorated, and it  would require a wild stretch of the imagination to note any traces of  improvement.    The reading of the verdict of a coroner's jury has never been known to  disqualify any person from serving on a trial jury in a murder case by  unduly influencing the opinion, or arousing the passions of such  involuntary candidate for the jury box. No jails have been stormed or  revolutions started by the verdict of an American coroner's jury, and  New York was not destined to have its sensibilities too harshly jarred  by a sensational verdict in this case.    After solemnly sitting for hours, the jury found that \"Said Emma Bell  came to her death from the effects of hydrocyanic acid administered by  some person to the said jurors unknown, and whether said hydrocyanic  acid was administered with felonious intent the said jurors cannot at  this time ascertain.\"    The facts established by the jury were, that the woman was dead; that  hydrocyanic acid had killed her; that the cause of death was so evident  that it was only necessary to examine the contents of the stomach; that  apparently none of the candied fruit had been disturbed, as the box was  even full and the top layer as smooth as when first packed; that a  chemical analysis proved that no poison of any kind was in any of the  candied fruit in the box; that no vial could be found on or near the  woman after death, and that a thorough search of the apartment failed  to disclose any of this or any other kind of poison; that the woman was  quite alone in the apartment when death took place and was only  discovered by the janitress at ten o'clock at night, at which time she  entered the apartment, having been invited to sleep there during the  absence of the child in the country, whither she had gone a few days  previous to this for a week's stay; that Mrs. Bell had been doing her  own work for several months and taking in fine sewing.    But ambitious newspaper reporters bent themselves to this new task, as  is their custom in all matters of public concern, _i. e._, to outrival  the most noted expert in the line of that particular phase of public  endeavor uppermost at the time. Theories were advanced in the daily  papers that made Sherlock Holmes seem like a novice in detective work  and Lucretia Borgia a mere infant in the skillful administration of  poisons. The regular detectives, both public and private, were aroused  by the mystery that shrouded the case. It remained, however, for the  ubiquitous reporter, to whom society really owes a debt along every line  of worthy public endeavor impossible either to estimate or discharge,  to discover that the handwriting on the box was that of Dr. John Earl,  and that he had been in the habit, for months, of paying almost daily  visits to the Bell home; that he was at Magnolia Beach, but a short ride  from Boston, at the time the package was mailed there; that ostensibly  he had visited the Bell home to attend the little girl who was injured  by the automobile, but that the mother was undoubtedly much interested  in him; that there were many rumors among surgeons that his operation on  the leg of the child had produced tuberculosis; that the district  attorney had received anonymous letters to the effect that Earl had  deliberately attempted to poison both mother and daughter, to be rid of  an unpleasant _liaison_ on the one hand and the evidence of his lack of  skill on the other; that the child had gone to the country after he left  the city and he still supposed her with her mother, hence the saving of  the child's life; that the box of candied fruit was only a blind, and  that some other package must have arrived containing the poison in  another form, possibly in the same wrapping paper with the fruit; that  no possible motive could be discovered for the poisoning by any other  person and no clue could be found leading to a suspicion of any one  else.    With five hundred thousand visitors constantly within the gates of their  city; with a shifting population of nearly a million more; with  permanent residents absorbed in the most strenuous existence known on  the American Continent; with sensation in high life of such frequent  occurrence as to benumb any effort to form a discriminating opinion--the  people of New York (visitors, temporary denizens, those of fixed  habitation) welcomed these ready-made conclusions of the daily press and  blindly adopted them as their own.    Individual character counts for less in the metropolis of the United  States than it does anywhere else in the nation. There are several  reasons for this, but the principal ones are a lack of time on the part  of the permanent residents to inform themselves on such matters and a  lack of interest in the subject on the part of the remainder of the  population. The result is, that when charges are made, with any degree  of sanction from the constituted authorities, against ordinary citizens  of hitherto blameless lives, the great majority of the people accept  such charges as well founded until they are effectively disproved.    So it was in this case. Just as soon as the incriminating facts  seriously involved Dr. John Earl it was taken for granted that he was  guilty, and such presumption was certain to grip the public mind until  his innocence could be duly established, if such result were at all  possible.    This was also the golden opportunity for the Bourbon members of his own  profession to assail his theories and, secretly and openly, certain of  them charged that the result in Dr. Earl's case was but the natural one  where \"standard methods\" of practice were set aside for the, as yet,  \"unscientific paths of suggestive therapeutics,\" as these reactionary  medical men denominated Earl's system, for he had cured through  suggestive methods a score of patients who had been condemned to the  operating table by other surgeons, and as a result he had aroused the  resentment of such surgeons in particular and the condemnation in  general of all those who believed in the supreme curative power of the  knife.    Those in other walks of life, who, from conviction or selfishness, were  opposed to disturbing present conditions, and who appreciated and  feared the interdependence of the whole progressive movement, were also  easily convinced that, properly enough, he was in the toils of the law.    It was not long until his friends and defenders began to realize that a  secret sentiment was being created against him which had for its purpose  the discrediting of his mental stability, as well as his medical  methods, and that they would be compelled to combat not only menacing  facts and conditions, but also the still more powerful influences of  centuries of prejudice against men of his type, who had dared to get too  far ahead of the general parade.    Psychologically, some interesting impressions were made upon observant  minds. Many of our national hypocrisies were emphasized, and these  occurrences revealed certain inconsistencies of public pretension and  action in other fields closely correlated to this one, and it became  evident that improvement in theory and practice, in matters of this  sort, was impossible so long as more fundamental abuses were not only  permitted but sanctioned in a most aggressively affirmative manner.    These observing people were reminded that in this Christian nation a  cross of considerable dimensions is generally ready"]]]
