A crowd of about thirty accepted this invitation, and they not  only went to the show, but later on dined at one of the restaurants  at Gabe's expense.    \"That sort of thing makes me tired,\" declared Spouter, when he heard  of this. \"Why, the poor fish is trying to buy votes!\"    At first Dan Soppinger had said that he did not care to run for the  captaincy, but a number of his friends insisted that he allow his name  to be put up, and finally he consented. Others went to Walt Baxter and  told him that he must run, too.    \"You've simply got to do it, Baxter,\" said Ned Lowe. \"If you don't,  some of the fellows who might vote for you will go over to Werner, and  he'll have a walkover from the start.\"    \"All right then, if you want me to stand I'll do it,\" said Walt. \"Just  the same, I think Jack Rover ought to have it, and I'm going to vote  for him.\"    The voting was to be held on the following Saturday, and on Monday  morning the cadets were to leave Colby Hall for Camp Barlight.  Consequently between getting ready to vote and preparing for the  encampment, all of the students were unusually busy.    The election was held in the main hall of the school, and was presided  over by Captain Dale and Professor Brice. It was announced that the  total number of votes to be cast would be 111 and the number necessary  for a choice would consequently be 56.    \"We will ballot for the major and the three captains separately,\"  announced Captain Dale. \"Then we will have the balloting for the  lieutenants.\"    The electing of a major for the next term proved easy. Ralph Mason  obtained ninety-one votes on the first ballot and was consequently  declared reelected.    \"Hurrah for Major Ralph Mason!\" cried one of the cadets, and the  cheers were given with a will.    Then followed the balloting for the captain of Company A and the  captain of Company B, and they were likewise reelected, and there was  more cheering.    \"We will now ballot for a captain for Company C,\" announced Captain  Dale.    There was a murmur, and the cadets once more formed a long line and  marched up to the platform, where each deposited his ballot in a big  box, located there for that purpose.    There was a smug grin on the face of Gabe Werner when he dropped in  his vote. It seemed to show that he felt sure of being elected.    A few minutes of silence occurred, during which time the votes were  being tabulated, and then Professor Brice struck a bell to attract the  attention of the cadets, and, stepping forward, read the result:        \"Total number of votes      111       Necessary to a choice       56       Gabe Werner has             32       Jack Rover has              32       Daniel Soppinger has        30       Walter Baxter has           17.\"    At this there was a murmur of voices, and all the cadets looked at  each other.    \"As no candidate has received the required number of votes, I will  leave you for ten minutes to talk matters over among yourselves, and  then we will have another vote,\" announced Captain Dale.    \"Say, Jack! what do you know about that?\" cried Fred. \"You and Werner  are tied for first place!\"    At this moment Walt Baxter came up.    \"Listen, Jack,\" he said in a low voice. \"I voted for you, and I would  just as lief withdraw in your favor, but some of the fellows who voted  for me say if I withdraw they will vote for Werner, so I'll have to  stay on the ticket. But it's a blamed shame!\" and Walt's face showed  that he meant what he said.    \"Say, Bill, we've got to get a hustle on and get more votes,\" growled  Gabe Werner to his crony, as they walked over to a corner.    \"I don't see how we're going to do it. I've talked to every fellow in  the school,\" said Glutts.    \"I'm entitled to this captaincy, and if they won't give it to me I  don't want anything,\" growled Gabe Werner. It angered him to think  that in spite of all the money he had spent he could muster up only  thirty-two votes.    While this was going on, Dan Soppinger had been circulating among  those who had been supporting him. Dan was gratified over the showing  he had made, but he did not want the position. Now he came up and  announced that he was going to withdraw.    \"I'm withdrawing in favor of Jack Rover,\" he declared in a loud voice,  and went around the hall repeating this statement. \"I want everybody  who voted for me to vote for Jack.\"    \"Not much we won't!\" cried one cadet. \"If you won't run, we'll vote  for Walt Baxter.\"    \"We want Bart White to run!\" put in another cadet.    \"All right, suit yourselves,\" said Dan, with a shrug of his shoulders.  \"Just the same, I'm out of it, so I don't want anybody to vote for me  again.\"    It was not long after this that the call came for the next ballot, and  once again the cadets filed up and placed their slips of paper in the  box. Then the counting began and was soon finished. Both Captain Dale  and Professor Brice seemed to be much disturbed over something that  had occurred, and the bell for silence rang out sharply.    \"This ballot cannot be counted!\" declared Captain Dale, in a stern  voice. \"There are but one hundred and eleven cadets present, but one  hundred and fifteen votes have been cast, showing that some person or  persons voted more than once. You will immediately prepare new votes  and stand in one long line, handing each vote to me as you come up.\"    \"Gee! what do you know about that?\" whispered Randy.    \"I wager some of the Werner crowd did that,\" remarked his twin.    \"How foolish to do anything of that sort,\" said Jack. \"They ought to  have known they couldn't get away with it.\"    \"Maybe they thought because Dan Soppinger retired some of the fellows  wouldn't vote,\" suggested Fred.    \"Well, if they thought that, they got left.\"    The next vote proved correct so far as numbers went, and once more the  figures were announced:        \"Number necessary to a choice      56       Jack Rover has                    54       Gabe Werner has                   30       Walter Baxter has                 20       Bart White has                     7.\"    \"Hurrah, Jack, you're going up!\" cried Fred enthusiastically.    \"You're only two votes shy of a choice,\" said Randy.    \"I guess you would have been elected if Bart White hadn't gone on the  ticket,\" returned Spouter.    At that moment both Walt Baxter and Bart White came rushing up to  Jack.    \"I'm going to retire in your favor, Jack,\" said Walt.    \"So am I,\" declared Bart.    \"Well, now, I didn't expect this,\" stammered Jack, hardly knowing what  to say.    \"I can't get it anyway,\" declared Walt, \"and as Werner is falling  behind, I think it's perfectly safe now to withdraw.\"    \"And I only went in to keep the votes from going to Werner,\" declared  Bart.    Both of these cadets hustled around among their supporters and let all  in the Hall know that they were withdrawing from the contest.    In the meantime Gabe Werner and his cronies circulated among the  crowd, and it was afterwards said that Werner even went so far as to  attempt to buy some votes, but without avail.    Then the next ballot was called for, and it was quickly cast.    \"We have at last reached a result,\" announced Captain Dale. \"And I am  glad of it.\" And then he read the figures.        \"Total number of votes cast      111       Necessary to a choice            56       Jack Rover has                   81       Gabe Werner has                  30.\"    \"Hurrah! Jack Rover is elected captain of Company C!\" and a great  cheer went throughout the hall.    \"He got all the votes that were cast for Baxter and White!\" cried  Fred.    \"Right you are!\" added Gif. \"Gabe Werner did not get a single vote  more than he had before.\"    \"And that was two less than he got at the start,\" added Spouter.    \"I hereby declare Jack Rover duly elected captain of Company C for the  ensuing term,\" said Captain Dale. \"Captain Rover, if you will come  forward, I shall be glad to shake hands with you,\" he added. And then,  as Jack walked to the platform to grasp the instructor's hand, there  was a great burst of applause.    \"Never mind, Gabe. We'll make you lieutenant again, anyway,\" declared  Bill Glutts, while this scene was being transacted.    \"I don't want to be lieutenant again!\" howled Gabe. \"If they don't  want me for a captain, they needn't have me for anything. I'll decline  to run!\" And thus speaking, Gabe Werner marched out of the room in  great disgust.    \"He sure is a sweet one!\" was Gif's comment.    A little while later it was announced that the balloting for  lieutenants would begin. The names of eight aspirants were put up,  including that of Fred Rover. There was a good deal of wire-pulling,  and it took nine ballots to decide the various choices. But in the end  Fred became the first lieutenant of the company of which Jack had been  made captain.    \"Good for you, Fred! I congratulate you!\" cried Jack, catching his  cousin by the hand.    \"I guess we'll all do that,\" declared Randy.    \"Three cheers for Lieutenant Fred Rover!\" exclaimed Spouter, and the  cheers were given with great heartiness, for Fred had made himself a  favorite throughout the school.    \"And now to get ready to go to Camp Barlight\" said Andy. \"My, but  won't we have the best times ever while we are under canvas!\"    \"I hope we do,\" answered Jack.    But a little later the newly-elected captain became somewhat doubtful  of this. As he and Fred, followed by the twins, went upstairs to their  rooms they passed Gabe Werner and his cronies in the main corridor.  The angular ex-lieutenant did not say a word, but he glared at Jack in  a baneful way that boded no good.    \"Werner has got it in for you, Jack,\" remarked Andy, when the four  Rovers were in their rooms and the doors had been closed.    \"I guess you're right,\" was Jack's reply. \"Well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23319"],[0,"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught (#19)"],[1,"point 1, which is at the intersection of diagonal with the  second horizontal line, will be 1/24 inch from vertical line _e_. Point  2 will be 2/24 inch from line _e_, and so on. For tenths of inches there  would require to be but six horizontal lines, the diagonals being drawn  as before. A similar scale is shown in Figure 225. Draw the lines A B, B  D, D C, C A, enclosing a square inch. Divide each of these lines into  ten equal divisions, and number and letter them as shown. Draw also the  diagonal lines A 1, _a_ 2, B 3, and so on; then the distances from the  line A C to the points of intersection of the diagonals with the  horizontal lines represent hundredths of an inch.    Suppose, for example, we trace one diagonal line in its path across the  figure, taking that which starts from A and ends at 1 on the top  horizontal line; then where the diagonal intersects _horizontal_ line 1,  is 99/100 from the line B D, and 1/100 from the line A C, while where it  intersects _horizontal_ line 2, is 98/100 from line B D, and 2/100 from  line A C, and so on. If we require to set the compasses to 67/100 inch,  we set them to the radius of _n_, and the figure 3 on line B D, because  from that 3 to the vertical line _d_ 4 is 6/10 or 60/100 inch, and from  that vertical line to the diagonal at _n_ is seven divisions from the  line C D of the figure.    In making a drawing to scale, however, it is an excellent plan to draw a  line and divide it off to suit the required scale. Suppose, for example,  that the given scale is one-quarter size, or three inches per foot; then  a line three inches long may be divided into twelve equal divisions,  representing twelve inches, and these may be subdivided into half or  quarter inches and so on. It is recommended to the beginner, however, to  spend all his time making simple drawings, without making them to scale,  in order to become so familiar with the use of the instruments as to  feel at home with them, avoiding the complication of early studies that  would accompany drawing to scale.          CHAPTER X.    _PROJECTIONS._      In projecting, the lines in one view are used to mark those in other  views, and to find their shapes or curvature as they will appear in  other views. Thus, in Figure 225_a_ we have a spiral, wound around a  cylinder whose end is cut off at an angle. The pitch of the spiral is  the distance A B, and we may delineate the curve of the spiral looking  at the cylinder from two positions (one at a right-angle to the other,  as is shown in the figure), by means of a circle having a circumference  equal to that of the cylinder.    The circumference of this circle we divide into any number of  equidistant divisions, as from 1 to 24. The pitch A B of the spiral or  thread is then divided off also into 24 equidistant divisions, as marked  on the left hand of the figure; vertical lines are then drawn from the  points of division on the circle to the points correspondingly numbered  on the lines dividing the pitch; and where line 1 on the circle  intersects line 1 on the pitch is one point in the curve. Similarly,  where point 2 on the circle intersects line 2 on the pitch is another  point in the curve, and so on for the whole 24 divisions on the circle  and on the pitch. In this view, however, the path of the spiral from  line 7 to line 19 lies on the other side of the cylinder, and is marked  in dotted lines, because it is hidden by the cylinder. In the  right-hand view, however, a different portion of the spiral or thread is  hidden, namely from lines 1 to 13 inclusive, being an equal proportion  to that hidden in the left-hand view.    [Illustration: Fig. 225 _a_.]    The top of the cylinder is shown in the left-hand view to be cut off at  an angle to the axis, and will therefore appear elliptical; in the  right-hand view, to delineate this oval, the same vertical lines from  the circle may be carried up as shown on the right hand, and horizontal  lines may be drawn from the inclined face in one view across the end of  the other view, as at P; the divisions on the circle may be carried up  on the right-hand view by means of straight lines, as Q, and arcs of  circle, as at R, and vertical lines drawn from these arcs, as line S,  and where these vertical lines S intersect the horizontal lines as P,  are points in the ellipse.    Let it be required to draw a cylindrical body joining another at a  right-angle; as for example, a Tee, such as in Figure 226, and the  outline can all be shown in one view, but it is required to find the  line of junction of one piece, A, with the other, B; that is, find or  mark the lines of junction C. Now when the diameters of A and B are  equal, the line of junction C is a straight line, but it becomes a  curved one when the diameter of A is less than that of B, or _vice  versa_; hence it may be as well to project it in both cases. For this  purpose the three views are necessary. One-quarter of the circle of B,  in the end view, is divided off into any number of equal divisions; thus  we have chosen the divisions marked _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, etc.; a  quarter of the top view is similarly divided off, as at _f_, _g_, _h_,  _i_, _j_; from these points of division lines are projected on to the  side view, as shown by the dotted lines _k_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _o_, _p_,  etc., and where these lines meet, as denoted by the dots, is in each  case a point in the line of junction of the two cylinders A, B.    [Illustration: Fig. 226.]    [Illustration: Fig. 227.]    Figure 227 represents a Tee, in which B is less in diameter than A;  hence the two join in a curve, which is found in a similar manner, as is  shown in Figure 227. Suppose that the end and top views are drawn, and  that the side view is drawn in outline, but that the curve of junction  or intersection is to be found. Now it is evident that since the centre  line 1 passes through the side and end views, that the face _a_, in the  end view, will be even with the face _a'_ in the side view, both being  the same face, and as the full length of the side of B in the end view  is marked by line _b_, therefore line _c_ projected down from _b_ will  at its junction with line _b'_, which corresponds to line _b_, give the  extreme depth to which _b'_ extends into the body A, and therefore, the  apex of the curve of intersection of B with A. To obtain other points,  we divide one-quarter of the circumference of the circle B in the top  view into four equal divisions, as by lines _d_, _e_, _f_, and from the  points of division we draw lines _j_, _i_, _g_, to the centre line  marked 2, these lines being thickened in the cut for clearness of  illustration. The compasses are then set to the length of thickened line  _g_, and from point _h_, in the end view, as a centre, the arc _g'_ is  marked. With the compasses set to the length of thickened line _i_, and  from _h_ as a centre, arc _i'_ is marked, and with the length of  thickened line _j_ as a radius and from _h_ as a centre arc _j'_ is  marked; from these arcs lines _k_, _l_, _m_ are drawn, and from the  intersection of _k_, _l_, _m_, with the circle of A, lines _n_, _o_, _p_  are let fall. From the lines of division, _d_, _e_, _f_, the lines _q_,  _r_, _s_ are drawn, and where lines _n_, _o_, _p_ join lines _q_, _r_,  _s_, are points in the curve, as shown by the dots, and by drawing a  line to intersect these dots the curve is obtained on one-half of B.  Since the axis of B is in the same plane as that of A, the lower half of  the curve is of the same curvature as the upper, as is shown by the  dotted curve.    [Illustration: Fig. 228.]    In Figure 228 the axis of piece B is not in the same plane as that of D,  but to one side of it to the distance between the centre lines C, D,  which is most clearly seen in the top view. In this case the process is  the same except in the following points: In the side view the line _w_,  corresponding to the line _w_ in the end view, passes within the line  _x_ before the curve of intersection begins, and in transferring the  lengths of the full lines _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_ to the end view, and  marking the arcs _b'_, _c'_, _d'_, _e'_, _f'_, they are marked from the  point _w_ (the point where the centre line of B intersects the outline  of A), instead of from the point _x_. In all other respects the  construction is the same as that in Figure 227.    [Illustration: Fig. 229.]    In these examples the axis of B stands at a right-angle to that of A.  But in Figure 229 is shown the construction where the axis of B is not  at a right-angle to A. In this case there is projected from B, in the  side view, an end view of B as at B', and across this end at a  right-angle to the centre line of B is marked a centre line C C of B',  which is divided as before by lines _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _h_, their  respective lengths being transferred from W as a centre, and marked by  the arcs _d'_, _e'_, _f'_, which are marked on a vertical line and  carried by horizontal lines, to the arc of A as at _i_, _j_, _k_. From  these points, _i_, _j_, _k_, the perpendicular lines _l_, _m_, _n_, _o_,  are dropped, and where these lines meet lines _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_, _t_,  are points in the curve of intersection of B with A. It will be observed  that each of the lines _m_, _n_, _o_, serves for two of the points in  the curve; thus, _m_ meets _q_ and _s_, while _n_ meets _p_ and _t_, and  _o_ meets the outline on each side of B, in the side view, and as _i_,  _j_, _k_ are obtained from _d_ and _e_, the lines _g_ and _h_ might have  been omitted, being inserted merely for the sake of illustration.    In Figure 230 is an example in which a cylinder intersects a cone, the  axes being parallel. To obtain the curve of intersection in this case,  the side view is divided by any convenient number of lines, as _a_, _b_,  _c_, etc., drawn at a right-angle to its axis A A, and from one end of  these lines are let fall the perpendiculars _f_, _g_,"]]]
