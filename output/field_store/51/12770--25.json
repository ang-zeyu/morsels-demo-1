We do not,  therefore, indiscriminately recommend them, but leave it to the  discretion of the farmer, to decide for himself, having seen estates  equally pleasant with, and without trees on the roadside. Nothing,  however, can be more beautiful than a clump of trees in a  pasture-ground, with a herd, or a flock beneath them, near the road; or  the grand and overshadowing branches of stately tree, in a rich meadow,  leaning, perhaps, over the highway fence, or flourishing in its solitary  grandeur, in the distance--each, and all, imposing features in the rural  landscape. All such should be preserved, with the greatest care and  solicitude, as among the highest and most attractive ornaments which the  farm can boast.            [Illustration: FARM HOUSE. Pages 131-132.]    DESIGN V.      We here present a dwelling of a more ambitious and pretending character  than any one which we have, as yet, described, and calculated for a  large and wealthy farmer, who indulges in the elegances of country life,  dispenses a liberal hospitality, and is every way a country gentleman,  such as all our farmers of ample means should be. It will answer the  demands of the retired man of business as well; and is, perhaps, as full  in its various accommodation as an American farm or country house may  require. It claims no distinct style of architecture, but is a  composition agreeable in effect, and appropriate to almost any part of  the country, and its climate. Its site may be on either hill or  plain--with a view extensive, or restricted. It may look out over broad  savannas, cultivated fields, and shining waters; it may nestle amid its  own quiet woods and lawn in its own selected shade and retirement, or  lord it over an extensive park, ranged by herds and flocks, meandered by  its own stream, spreading anon into the placid lake, or rushing swiftly  over its own narrow bed--an independent, substantial, convenient, and  well-conditioned home, standing upon its own broad acres, and comporting  with the character and standing of its occupant, among his friends and  neighbors.    The main building is 50x40 feet in area upon the ground, two stories  high; the ground story 11 feet high, its floor elevated 2-1/2 or 3 feet  above the level of the surrounding surface, as its position may demand;  the chambers 9 feet high, and running 2 feet into the roof. The rear  wing is one and a half stories high, 36x16 feet; the lower rooms 11 feet  high, with a one story lean-to range of closets, and small rooms on the  weather side, 8 feet in width and 9 feet high. In the rear of these is a  wood-house, 30x20 feet, with 10 feet posts, dropped to a level with the  ground. At the extremity of this is a building, by way of an L, 60x20  feet, one and a half stories high, with a lean-to, 12x30 feet, in the  rear. The ground rooms of this are elevated 1-1/2 feet above the ground,  and 9 feet high. A broad roof covers the whole, standing at an angle of  40 or 45deg above a horizontal line, and projecting widely over the  walls, 2-1/2 to 3 feet on the main building, and 2 feet on the others,  to shelter them perfectly from the storms and damps of the weather. A  small cupola stands out of the ridge of the rear building, which may  serve as a ventilator to the apartments and lofts below, and in it may  be hung a bell, to summon the household, or the field laborers, as the  case may be, to their duties or their meals.    The design, as here shown, is rather florid, and perhaps profusely  ornamental in its finish, as comporting with the taste of the day; but  the cut and moulded trimmings may be left off by those who prefer a  plain finish, and be no detriment to the general effect which the deep  friezes of the roofs, properly cased beneath, may give to it. Such,  indeed, is our own taste; but this full finish has been added, to  gratify such as wish the full ornament which this style of building may  admit.        [Illustration: GROUND PLAN.]    INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT.    The front of this house is accommodated by a porch, or veranda, 40 feet  long, and 10 feet wide, with a central, or entrance projection of 18  feet in length, and 12 feet in width, the floor of which is eight inches  below the main floor of the house. The wings, or sides of this veranda  may be so fitted up as to allow a pleasant conservatory on each side of  the entrance area in winter, by enclosing them with glass windows, and  the introduction of heat from a furnace under the main hall, in the  cellar of the house. This would add to its general effect in winter,  and, if continued through the summer, would not detract from its  expression of dignity and refinement. From the veranda, a door in the  center of the front, with two side windows, leads into the main hall,  which is 26x12 feet in area, two feet in the width of which is taken  from the rooms on the right of the main entrance. On the left of the  hall a door opens into a parlor or drawing-room, marked P, 20 feet  square, with a bay window on one side, containing three sashes, and  seats beneath. A single window lights the front opening on to the  veranda. On the opposite side to this is the fireplace, with blank walls  on each side. On the opposite side of the hall is a library, 18x16 feet,  with an end window, and a corresponding one to the parlor, in front,  looking out on the veranda. In case these portions of the veranda,  opposite the two front windows are occupied as conservatories, these  windows should open to the floor, to admit a walk immediately into them.  At the farther corner of the library a narrow door leads into an office,  or business apartment, 12x8 feet, and opening by a broad door, the upper  half of which is a lighted sash. This door leads from the office out on  a small porch, with a floor and two columns, 8x5 feet, and nine feet  high, with a gable and double roof of the same pitch as the house.  Between the chimney flues, in the rear of this room may be placed an  iron safe, or chest for the deposit of valuable papers; and, although  small, a table and chairs sufficient to accommodate the business  requirements of the occupant, may be kept in it. A chimney stands in the  center of the inner wall of the library, in which may be a fireplace, or  a flue to receive a stovepipe, whichever may be preferred for warming  the room.    Near the hall side of the library a door opens into a passage leading  into the family bedroom, or nursery. A portion of this passage may be  shelved and fitted up as a closet for any convenient purpose. The  nursery is 18x16 feet in size, lighted by two windows. It may have an  open fireplace, or a stove, as preferred, let into the chimney,  corresponding to that in the library. These two chimneys may either be  drawn together in the chambers immediately above, or carried up  separately into the garret, and pass out of the roof in one stack, or  they maybe built in one solid mass from the cellar bottom; but they are  so placed here, as saving room on the floors, and equally accommodating,  in their separate divisions, the stovepipes that may lead into them.  On the inner side of the nursery, a door leads into a large closet, or  child's sleeping-room, 9x8 feet; or it may be used as a dressing-room,  with a sash inserted in the door to light it. A door may also lead from  it into the small rear entry of the house, and thus pass directly out,  without communicating with the nursery. On the extreme left corner of  the nursery is a door leading into the back entry, by which it  communicates either with the rear porch, the dining-room, or the  kitchen. Such a room we consider indispensable to the proper  accommodation of a house in the country, as saving a world of  up-and-down-stairs' labor to her who is usually charged with the  domestic cares and supervision of the family.    On the right of the main hall an ample staircase leads into the upper  hall by a landing and broad stair at eight feet above the floor, and a  right-angled flight from that to the main floor above. Under this main  hall staircase, a door and stairs may lead into the cellar. Beyond the  turning flight below, a door leads into the back hall, or entry, already  mentioned, which is 13x4 feet in area, which also has a side passage of  8x4 feet, and a door leading to the rear porch, and another into the  kitchen at its farther side, near the outer one. Opposite the turning  flight of stairs, in the main hall, is also a door leading to the  dining-room, 20x16 feet. This is lighted by a large double window at the  end. A fireplace, or stove flue is in the center wall, and on each side  a closet for plate, or table furniture. These closets come out flush  with the chimney. At the extreme right corner a door leads into the rear  entry--or this may be omitted, at pleasure. Another door in the rear  wall leads into the kitchen, past the passage down into the cellar--or  this may be omitted, if thought best. Still another door to the left,  opens into a large dining closet of the back lean-to apartments, 8x8  feet. This closet is lighted by a window of proper architectural size,  and fitted up with a suite of drawers, shelves, table, and cupboards,  required for the preparation and deposit of the lighter family stores  and edibles. From this closet is also a door leading into the kitchen,  through which may be passed all the meats and cookery for the table,  either for safe-keeping, or immediate service. Here the thrifty and  careful housekeeper and her assistants may, shut apart, and by  themselves, get up, fabricate, and arrange all their table delicacies  with the greatest convenience and privacy, together with ease of access  either to the dining-room or kitchen--an apartment most necessary in a  liberally-arranged establishment.    From the rear entry opens a door to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#19)"],[1,"ators.  His  Vindiciae Sabbathi (1641, 8vo) had a profound and lasting  influence in the long Sabbatarian controversy.  His Brief  Notes upon the Whole Book of Psalms (1651, 4to), as its date  shows, was posthumous.  He died on the 2nd of February 1648.

ABBOT, ROBERT (1588?-1662?), English Puritan divine.  Noted  as this worthy was in his own time, and representative in  various ways, he has often since been confounded with others,  e.g. Robert Abbot, bishop of Salisbury.  He is also wrongly  described as a relative of Archbishop Abbot, from whom he  acknowledges very gratefully, in the first of his epistles  dedicatory of A Hand of Fellowship to Helpe Keepe out Sinne  and Antichrist (1623, 4to), that he had ``received all'' his  ``worldly maintenance,'' as well as ``best earthly countenance',  and ``fatherly incouragements.', The worldly maintenance  was the presentation in 1616 to the vicarage of Cranbrook in  Kent.  He had received his education at Cambridge, where he  proceeded M.A., and was afterwards incorporated at Oxford.  In  1639, in the epistle to the reader of his most noticeable book  historically, his Triall of our Church-Forsakers, he tells  us, ``I have lived now, by God's gratious dispensation, above  fifty years, and in the place of my allotment two and twenty  full.'' The former date carries us back to 1588-1589, or  perhaps 1587-1588 ---the ``Armada'' year---as his birth-time;  the latter to 1616-1617 (ut supra). In his Bee Thankfull  London and her Sisters (1626), he describes himself as  formerly ``assistant to a reverend divine . . . now with  God,'' and the name on the margin is ``Master Haiward of Wool  Church (Dorset).'' This was doubtless previous to his going to  Cranbrook.  Very remarkable and effective was Abbot's  ministry at Cranbrook, where his parishioners were as his  own ``sons and daughters'' to him.  Yet, Puritan though he  was, he was extremely and often unfairly antagonistic to  Nonconformists.  He remained at Cranbrook until 1643, when,  Parliament deciding against pluralities of ecclesiastical  offices, he chose the very inferior living of Southwick,  Hants, as between the one and the other.  He afterwards  succeeded the ``extruded'' Udall of St Austin's, London,  where according to the Warning-piece he was still pastor in  1657.  He disappears silently between 1657-1658 and 1662.  Robert Abbot's books are conspicuous amongst the productions  of his time by their terseness and variety.  In addition to  those mentioned above he wrote Milk for Babes, or a Mother's  Catechism for her Children (1646), and A Christian Family  builded by God, or Directions for Governors of Families (1653).

ABBOT, WILLIAM (1798--1843), English actor, was born in  Chelsea, and made his first appearance on the stage at Bath  in 1806, and his first London appearance in 1808.  At Covent  Garden in 1813, in light comedy and melodrama, he made his  first decided success.  He Was Pylades to Macready's Orestes  in Ambrose Philips's Distressed Mother when Macready made  his first appearance at that theatre (1816).  He created the  parts of Appius Claudius in Sheridan Knowles's Virginius  (1820) and of Modus in his Hunchback (1832).  In 1827 he  organized the company, including Macready and Miss Smithson,  which acted Shakespeare in Paris.  On his return to London  he played Romeo to Fanny Kemble's Juliet (1830).  Two of  Abbot's melodramas, The Youthful Days of Frederick the Great  (1817) and Swedish Patriotism (1819), were produced at  Covent Garden.  He died in poverty at Baltimore, Maryland.    ABBOT (from the Hebrew ab, a father, through the Syriac  abba, Lat. abbas, gen. abbatis, O.E. abbad, fr. late  Lat. form abbad-em changed in 13th century under influence  of the Lat. form to abbat, used abternatively till the end  of the 17th century; Ger. Abt; Fr. abbe), the head and  chief governor of a community of monks, called also in the  East hegumenos or archimandrite.  The title had its origin  in the monasteries of Syria, whence it spread through the  East, and soon became accepted generally in all languages as  the designation of the head of a monastery.  At first it was  employed as a respectful title for any monk, as we learn from St  Jerome, who denounced the custom on the ground that Christ had  said, ``Call no man father on earth'' (in Epist. ad Gal.  iv. 6, in Matt. xxiii. 9), but it was soon restricted to the  superior.  The name ``abbot,'' though general in the West,  was never universal.  Among the Dominicans, Carmelites,  Augustinians, &c., the superior was called Praepositus,  ``provost,'' and Prior; among the Franciscans, Custos,  ``guardian''; and by the monks of Camaldoi, Major.    In Egypt, the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction  of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined.  Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over  several, each of which had its own abbot as well.  Cassian  speaks of an abbot of the Thebaid who had 500 monks under  him, a number exceeded in other cases.  By the rule of St  Benedict, which, until the reform of Cluny, was the norm  in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one  community.  The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to  frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of  the Cluniac Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising  jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely  recognized.  New styles were devised to express this new  relation; thus the abbot of Monte Cassino was called abbas  abbatum, while the chiefs of other orders had the tities  abbas generails, or magister or minister generalis.    Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot  any exception.  All orders of clergy, therefore, even the  ``doorkeeper,', took precedence of him.  For the reception  of the sacraments, and for other religious offices, the  abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest  church (Nocellae, 133, c. ii.).  This rule naturally proved  inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at  a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the ordination  of abbots.  This innovation was not introduced without a  struggle, ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent  with the higher spiritual life, but, before the close of  the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost  universally to have become deacons, if not presbyters.  The  change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of  abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th  century, and partially so up to the 11th.  Ecclesiastical  councils were, however, attended by abbots.  Thus at that  held at Constantinople, A.D. 448, for the condemnation of  Eutyches, 23 archimandrites or abbots sign, with 30 bishops,  and, c A.D. 690, Archbishop Theodore promulgated a  canon, inhibiting bishops from compelling abbots to attend  councils.  Examples are not uncommon in Spain and in England  in Saxon times.  Abbots were permitted by the second council  of Nicaea, A.D. 787, to ordain their monks to the inferior  orders.  This rule was adopted in the West, and the strong  prejudice against clerical monks having gradually broken down,  eventually monks, almost without exception, took holy orders.    Abbots were originally subject to episcopal jurisdiction, and  continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th  century.  The Code of Justinian (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg.  xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight.  The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot  from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins,  at the council of Arles, A.D. 456; but the exorbitant claims  and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal  control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of  abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th  century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or  altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible  to the pope alone, received an impulse from Gregory the  Great.  These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had  grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually  creating an imperium in imperio, and depriving the bishop  of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his  diocese.  In the 12th century the abbots of Fulda claimed  precedence of the archbishop of Cologne.  Abbots more and  more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the  prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and  others, adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre, ring, gloves and  sandals.  It has been maintained that the right to wear mitres  was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th  century, but the documents on which this claim is based are  not genuine (J. Braun, Liturgische Gewandung, p. 453).  The  first undoubted instance is the bull by which Alexander II.  in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of  the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury (see MITRE). The  mitred abbots in England were those of Abingdon, St Alban's,  Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmund's, St Augustine's Canterbury,  Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury, Gloucester,  St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey,  Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster,  Winchcombe, St Mary's York.  Of these the precedence was  originally yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in  A.D. 1154 Adrian IV. (Nicholas"]]]
