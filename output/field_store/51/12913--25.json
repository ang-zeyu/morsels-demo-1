So my grandfather warned him off seein' his daughter. I never  heard the rights of it, but it seems m' father didn't take kindly to  bein' ordered around.\"    Kirby chuckled. \"That theah feelin' is borned right into a Texas boy. He  probably took the gal an' ran off with her--\"    \"You're guessing right. At least that's the story as I've put it  together. Mostly nobody would tell me anything. I was the blacksheep  from the day I was born--\"    \"But your ma, she'd give you the right of it.\"    \"She died when I was born. That's another thing my grandfather had  against me. I was Hunt Rennie's son, and I killed my mother; that's the  way he saw it.\"    Kirby rolled his head on his arm so that his hazel eyes were on Drew's  thin, too controlled features.    \"Sounds like your grandpappy had a burr under his tail an' bucked it out  on you.\"    \"You might see it that way. You know, Anse, I'd like to see Texas--\"    \"After we finish up this heah war, compadre, we can jus' mosey down  theah an' look it over good. Happen you don't take to Texas, why,  theah's New Mexico, the Arizona territory ... clean out to California,  wheah they dip up that theah gold dust so free. Ain't nothin' sayin' a  man has to stay on one range all his born days--\"    \"Looks like the war ain't doin' too well.\" Drew was watching the  activity in the stockade.    \"Well, we lost us Atlanta, sure enough. An' every time we close up  ranks, theah's empty saddles showin'. But General Forrest, he's still  toughenin' it out. Me, I'll trail along with him any day in the week.\"    \"Hey!\" Kirby was drawing a bead on a shaking bush. But the man edging  through was Hew Wilkins, General Buford's Sergeant of Scouts. He crawled  up beside them to peer at the blockhouse.    \"They're pullin' out!\" The men in blue coats were lining up about a  small wagon train.    Wilkins used binoculars for a closer look. \"Your report was right; those  are Negro troops!\"    \"No wonder they're clearin' out--fast.\"    \"Cheatin' us outta a fight,\" Kirby observed with mock seriousness.    \"All the better. Kirby, you cut back and tell the General they're givin'  us free passage. We can get the work done here, quick.\"    \"Back to axes, eh, an' some nice dry firewood--an' see what we can do to  mess up the railroads for the Yankees. Only, seems like we're messin' up  a sight of railroads, all down in our own part of the country. I'd like  to be doin' this up in one of them theah Yankee states like New York,  say, or Indiana. Saw me some mighty fine railroads to cut up, that time  General Morgan took us on a sashay through Indiana.\"    Kirby got to his feet and stretched. Drew unwound his own lanky length  to join the other.    \"Maybe the old man will be leadin' us up there, too--\" Wilkins put away  the binoculars. \"Rennie, we'll move on down there and see if we can pick  up any information.\"    Two months or a little more since Harrisburg. The brazen heat had given  way to torrents in mid-August, and the rain had made quagmire traps of  roads, forming rapids of every creek and river--bogging down horses,  men, and guns. But it had not bogged down Bedford Forrest. And one  section of his small force, under the command of General Buford leading  the Kentuckians, had held the Union forces in check, while the other,  under Forrest's personal leadership had swung past Smith and his blue  coats in a lightning raid on Memphis.    Now in September the rain was still falling in the mountains, keeping  the streams up to bank level. And Forrest was also on the move. After  the Memphis raid there had been a second honing of his army into razor  sharpness, a razor to be brought down with its cutting edge across those  railroads which carried the lifeblood of supplies to the Union army  around Atlanta.    Blockhouses fell to dogged attack or surrendered to bluff, the bluff of  Forrest's name. The Kentucky General Buford was leading his division of  the command up the railroad toward the Elk River Bridge and that was  below the scouts now, being abandoned by the Union troopers.    Two factors had brought Drew into Buford's Scouts. If Dr. Cowan,  Forrest's own chief surgeon, had not been the medical officer to whom  Drew had by chance delivered those saddlebags of drugs, and if Abram  Buford had not been a division commander, Drew might not have been able  to push through his transfer. But Cowan had spoken to Forrest, and  General Buford had known both the Barretts and the Mattocks all his  life.    Boyd had recovered speedily from the leg wound, but his convalescence  from heat exhaustion and the ensuing complications was still in  progress, though he had reached the point that only General Buford's  strict orders had kept him from this second raid into enemy territory.  Now he was safe in a private home in Meridian, where he was being  treated as a son of the house, and Drew had even managed to send a  letter to Cousin Merry with that information. He only hoped that she had  received it.    As for the change in commands, Drew was content. Perhaps the more so  since the news had come less than two weeks earlier that John Morgan was  dead. He had gone down fighting, shooting it out with Yankee troopers in  a rain-wet garden in Tennessee on a Sunday morning. Men were dying,  dead ... and maybe a cause was dying, too. Drew's thought flinched away  from that line now, trying to keep to the job before them. There was the  abandoned stockade to destroy, the trestle and bridge to knock to  pieces, and if they had time, the tracks to tear up, heat, and twist out  of shape.    Wilkins stood behind a pile of wood cut for engine fuel. \"They are on  the run, all right. Headin' toward Pulaski.\"    \"Think they'll make a stand there?\"    \"One guess is as good as another. If they do, we'll smoke them out. Keep  'em busy and chase 'em clean out of their hats and back to camp.\"    The destruction of the blockhouse and the trestle could be left to the  army behind; the scouts moved on again.    \"The boys are havin' themselves a time.\" Kirby returned to his post with  the advance. \"Tyin' bowknots in rails gits easier all the time. When  this heah campaign is over, we'll know more 'bout takin' railroads apart  then the fellas who make 'em know 'bout puttin' 'em together.\"    \"Trouble!\" Drew reined in Hannibal and waved to Wilkins. \"There's a  picket up there....\"    Kirby's gaze followed the other's pointing finger. \"Kinda green at the  business,\" he commented critically. \"Sorta makin' a sittin' target of  hisself. Like to tickle him up with a shot. We don't git much action  outta this.\"    \"I'd say we're plannin' to go in now.\"    A squad of Buford's advance filtered up through the trees, and an  officer, his insignia of rank two-inch strips of yellowish ribbon sewed  to the collar of a mud-brown coat, was conferring with Wilkins. Then the  clear notes of the bugle charge rang out.    Forrest's men were as adept as Morgan's raiders in making a show of  force seem twice the number of men actually in the field. They now  whirled in and out of a wild pattern which should impress the Yankee  picket with the fact that at least a full regiment was advancing.    Three miles from Pulaski the Yankees made a stand, slamming back with  all they had, but Buford was pushing just as hard and determinedly.  Gray-brown boiled out of cover and charged, yelling. That electric spark  of reckless determination which had taken the Kentucky columns up the  slope at Harrisburg flashed again from man to man. Drew tasted the old  headiness which could sweep a man out of sanity, send him plunging  ahead, aware only of the waiting enemy.    The Union lines broke under those shock waves; men ran for the town  behind them. But there was no taking that town. By early afternoon they  had them fenced in, held by a show of force. Only in the night, leaving  their fires burning, the Confederates slipped away.    Rains hit again; guns and wagons bogged. But they kept on into  rough-and-rocky country. They had taken enough horses from the Union  corrals at the blockhouses to mount the men who had tramped patiently  along the ruts in just that hope. Better still, sugar and coffee from  the rich Yankee supply depot at the Brown farm was now filling Rebel  stomachs.    Drew sat on his heels by a palm-sized fire, watching with weary content  the tin pail boiling there. The aroma rising from it was one he had  almost forgotten existed in this world of constant riding and poor  forage.    \"Hope it kicks in the middle an' packs double.\" Kirby rested a tin cup  on one knee, ready and waiting. \"Me, I like mine strong enough to rest a  horseshoe on ... gentlelike.\"    \"Yankees are obligin', one way or another.\" Drew licked his fingers  appreciatively. He had been exploring the sugar supply. \"I've missed  sweetenin'.\"    \"Drink up, boys, and get ready to ride,\" Wilkins said, coming out of the  dark. \"We've marchin' orders.\"    Kirby reached for the pot and poured its contents, with careful  measurement, into each waiting cup. \"Wheah to now, Sarge? Seems like  we've covered most of this heah range already.\"    \"Huntsville. We have to locate a river crossin'.\"    Drew looked up. \"Startin' back, Sarge?\"    \"Heard talk,\" Wilkins admitted. \"Most of the blue bellies in these parts  are turnin' lines to aim square at us. We can't take on all of Sherman's  bully boys--\"    \"Got him riled, though, ain't we? All right.\" Kirby was energetically  fanning the top of his steaming cup with his free hand. \"Git this down  to warm m' toes, Sarge, an' I'll stick them same toes in the stirrups  an' jingle off. Come on, Drew, no man never joined up with the army to  git hisself a comfortable life....\"    Certainly that last statement of the Texan's was proven correct during  the next six days. A feint toward the Yankee garrison at Huntsville  occupied the enemy until the wagon train and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23644"],[0,"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman (#19)"],[1,"hurt. I--you see--I never  invite anyone here--because--well, just because we are so poor. I  thought you wouldn't care to come and so----\"    \"I've always wanted to come,\" interrupted Marjorie, eagerly. \"I don't  think you are poor. I think you are rich to have this wonderful music. I  never dreamed you could sing, Constance. What made you keep it a  secret?\"    \"No one ever liked me well enough to care to know it until you came,\"  returned Constance simply. \"I meant to tell you, but I kept on putting  it off.\"    While the conversation went on between the two girls the one old man was  going over a pile of ragged-edged music on the piano, while the other  was industriously engaged with a troublesome E string.    \"Father, Uncle John!\" called Constance, gently, \"come here. I want you  to meet my friend Marjorie Dean.\"    Both musicians left their self-appointed tasks and came forward.    Marjorie gave her soft little hand to each in turn, and they bowed over  it with almost old-style courtesy. She looked curiously at Constance's  father. His daughter did not in any way resemble him. His was the face  of a dreamer, rather thin, with clean-cut features and dark eyes that  seemed to see past one and into another world of his own creation. In  spite of his white hair he was not old. Not more than forty-five, or,  perhaps fifty, Marjorie decided. The other man was much older, sixty at  least. He was very thin, and his gentle face wore a pathetically vacant  expression that brought back to Marjorie the rush of bitter words  Constance had poured forth on the day when she had declined to be  friends. \"We take care of an old man who people say is crazy, and folks  call us Bohemians and gypsies and even vagabonds.\"    \"I came here to see if Constance could go to the theatre with us  to-night,\" explained Marjorie, rather shyly. \"No, thank you, I won't sit  down. I promised mother I'd hurry home.\"    \"It is very kind in you to ask my daughter to share your pleasure,\" said  Constance's father, his somber face lighting with a smile that reminded  Marjorie of the sun suddenly bursting from behind a cloud. \"I should  like to have her go.\"    \"Have her go,\" repeated the thin old man, bowing and beaming.    \"Is there a band at the theatre?\" piped a small, solemn voice.    Marjorie smiled down into the earnest, upraised face of the little boy.    \"Oh, yes, there is a big, big band at the theatre.\"    \"Then take me, too,\" returned the child calmly.    \"No, no,\" reproved Constance gently, \"Charlie can't go to-night.\"    A grieved look crept into the big black eyes. Without further words the  quaint little boy limped over to the old man, whom Constance had  addressed as Uncle John, and hid behind him.    Forgetting formality, tender-hearted Marjorie sprang after him. She  knelt beside him and gathered him into her arms. He made no resistance,  merely regarded her with wistful curiosity.    \"Listen, dear little man,\" she said, \"you and Constance and I will go to  the place where the big band plays some Saturday afternoon, and we'll  sit on the front seat where you can see every single thing they do.  Won't that be nice?\"    The boy nodded and slipped his tiny hand in hers. \"I'm going to play in  the band when I grow up,\" he confided. \"Connie can go to-night if she  promises to tell me all about it afterward.\"    \"You dear little soul,\" bubbled Marjorie, stroking his thick hair that  fell carelessly over his forehead and almost into his bright eyes.    \"I'll tell you all about everything, Charlie,\" promised Constance.    \"That means you will go,\" cried Marjorie, joyfully, rising from the  floor, the child's hand still in hers.    \"Yes, I will,\" returned Constance hesitatingly, \"only--I--haven't  anything pretty to wear.\"    \"Pretty to wear,\" repeated Uncle John faithfully.    \"Never mind that,\" reassured Marjorie. \"Just wear a fresh white blouse  with your blue suit. I'm sure that will look nice.\"    \"Will look nice,\" agreed Uncle John so promptly, that Marjorie started  slightly, then, noting that Constance seemed embarrassed, she nodded  genially at the old man, who smiled back like a pleased child.    Remembering her mother's injunction, Marjorie took hasty leave of the  Stevens family and set off for home at a brisk pace. Her thoughts were  as active as her feet. She had seen enough in the last fifteen minutes  to furnish ample food for reflection, and she now believed she  understood her friend's strange reserve, which at times rose like a wall  between them. What strange and yet what utterly delightful people the  Stevens were! They really did remind one a little of gypsies. And what a  queer room she had been ushered into by the odd little boy named  Charlie! She smiled to herself as she contrasted her mother's homelike,  yet orderly living-room with the room she had just left, which evidently  did duty as a hall, living-room, music-room and also a playroom for  little Charlie. There were hats and coats and musical instruments, pile  upon pile of well-thumbed music, and numerous dilapidated playthings  that bore the marks of too ardent treasuring, all scattered about in  reckless confusion. No wonder Constance had fought shy of  acquaintanceships which were sure to ripen into schoolgirl visits. Poor  Constance! How dreadful it must be to have to keep house, cook the meals  and try to go to school! The Stevenses seemed to be very poor in  everything except music. She wondered how they lived. Perhaps the two  men played in orchestras. Still she had never heard anything about them  in school, where news circulated so quickly.    \"I'm going to ask Constance to tell me all about it,\" she decided, as  she skipped up the front steps. \"Perhaps I can help her in some way.\"    Constance rang the Deans' bell at exactly half past seven o'clock. Her  blue eyes were sparkling with joyous light, and her usually grave mouth  broke into little curves of happiness. It was to be a red-letter night  for her.    The play was a clean, wholesome drama of American home life in which the  leading part was taken by a young girl, who appeared to be scarcely  older than Marjorie and Constance. The latter sat like one entranced  during the first act, and Marjorie spoke to her twice before she heard.    \"Constance,\" she breathed, \"won't you please, please tell me all about  it?\"    \"About what?\" counter-questioned the other girl, reddening.    \"About your father and your wonderful voice, and, oh, all there is to  tell.\"    \"Marjorie,\" the Mary girl's tones were strained and wistful, \"do you  really think it is wonderful?\"    \"You will be a great singer some day,\" returned Marjorie, simply.    \"Oh, do you believe that?\" Constance clasped her hands in ecstasy. \"I  wish to be--I hope to be. If I could only go away to New York city and  study! Before we came here we lived in Buffalo. Father played in an  orchestra there. He had a friend who taught singing and I studied with  him for a year. Then he died suddenly of pneumonia and right after that  father fell on an icy pavement and broke his leg. By the time it was  well again another man had his place in the orchestra. He had a few  pupils, and long before his leg was well he used to sit in a big chair  and teach them. The money that they paid him for lessons was all we had  to live on.\"    The rising of the curtain on the second act cut short the narrative.  With \"I'll tell you the rest later,\" Constance turned eager eyes toward  the stage.    \"Isn't it a beautiful play?\" she sighed, when the act ended.    \"Lovely,\" agreed Marjorie; \"now tell me the rest.\"    \"Oh, there isn't much more to tell. It was the last of March when father  got hurt, but it was the middle of May before he was quite well again.  Then summer came and most of his pupils went away and we grew poorer and  poorer. Just when we were the poorest the editor of a new musical  magazine wrote him and asked him to write some articles. A friend of  father's in New York told the editor about father and gave him our  address. We decided to move to a smaller city, where we could live more  cheaply, and some of the musicians that father knew gave him a benefit  concert. The money from that helped us to move to Sanford, and father  has been writing articles off and on for the magazine ever since then.  It's better for all of us to be here. Uncle John isn't quite like other  people. When he was a young man he studied to be a virtuoso on the  violin. He overworked and had brain fever just before he was to give his  first recital. After he got well he never played the same again. He had  spent all the money his father left him on his musical education, so he  had to find work wherever he could. He played the violin in different  orchestras, but he was so absent-minded that he couldn't be trusted.  Sometimes he would go on playing after all the rest of the orchestra had  finished, and then he began to repeat things after people.    \"When father first met him they were playing in the same theatre  orchestra. One night a great tragedian was playing 'Hamlet,' and poor  Uncle John grew so interested that he said things after him as loud as  he could. The actor was dreadfully angry, and so was the leader of the  orchestra. He made the poor old man leave the theatre. After that he  played in other orchestras a little, but he couldn't be depended upon,  so no one wanted to hire him.    \"Father did all he could to help him, but he grew queerer and queerer.  Then he disappeared, and father didn't see him for a long while. One  cold winter night he found him wandering about the streets, so he  brought him to his room and he has been with father ever since. That was  years ago, before father was married. He isn't really my uncle. I just  call him that. The musicians used to call him 'Crazy Johnny.' His name  is John Roland.\"    Although Constance had averred that there wasn't \"much to tell,\" the  third act interrupted her recital, and it was during the interval"]]]
