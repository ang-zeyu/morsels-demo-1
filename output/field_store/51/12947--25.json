The Institute and Training School of Young Men's Christian  Associations, Chicago and Lake Geneva.                                                October 7, 1908.    Dr. Winfield S. Hall, Northwestern Medical School, Chicago, Ill.    My Dear Dr. Hall:        I want to express my appreciation of your talk to boys on Sexual      Hygiene. I listened with the greatest of interest to your      presentation before the Boys' Conference at Lake Geneva the past      summer and it seemed to me that both in substance and in form of      presentation you hit the nail on the head in a way I had never      before seen it done. I believe that your contribution to boys in      this direction is to be even greater than that which you have      been making to young men.                                           Sincerely yours,                                                FRANK H. BURT,                                                    President.      State Agricultural College of Colorado.    Dr. Winfield S. Hall,    Fort Collins, Colo., October 27, 1908.      Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago.    Dear Doctor:        I wish to testify to the value of your lecture to boys from 12      to 16 years of age. You have touched a vital subject in a most      original way that impresses every boy that hears you. You lead      up to your \"Secret of Manhood\" in a manner that holds the      attention, impresses the truth you want to teach, so that it is      sure to be of lasting good.        This lecture I regard as the very best of its kind, which I have      ever heard.                                           Sincerely yours,                                                   W.H. OLIN.            Vice Dean, State Agricultural College of Colorado.      Princeton Township High School.                               Princeton, Ill., October 6, 1908.        Dr. Winfield S. Hall of the Northwestern University Medical      School recently gave a talk to our high school boys along      physiological lines, setting forth very scientifically but      plainly many delicate and important truths which every boy      should know. Dr. Hall is a master of his subject and his manner      is so dignified and yet sympathetic that he commands respect and      holds the closest attention. I feel sure that such a talk given      to boys and young men does a great amount of good.                                                 Sincerely,                                            H.S.

Chicago, Ill., October 4, 1908.    My dear Doctor:        I am more than glad to speak a word in commendation of your      lecture to boys on the \"Secret of Manhood.\" To me it is the most      sane, safe and logical presentation of a much avoided subject      that I have ever heard. The boys at the Lake Geneva Conference      were strongly impressed without the undue excitement and morbid      curiosity that so often accompany the presentation of the      subject of \"Personal Purity.\" And not only were the boys      benefited, but all the fifty boy workers present, representing      the entire Central West, had nothing but words of highest praise      for the way you handled the subject before two hundred older      boys.        I am glad that you are getting out material for a booklet on the      \"Secret of Manhood,\" and shall be pleased to see the manuscript.      We are much in need of such a thing and believe the      International Committee can aid you in getting it out if      necessary. Yours cordially,                                                    F.A. CROSBY,           Boys' Work Secy., International Committee.

A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#19)"],[1,"the handkerchief, and Mrs. Bethune is the  Iago. (Laughter.) This young man tells me, that in accordance with  ancient usage and time-honored customs existing between this gentleman  and lady, she had given him, as she narrated here, money to enable Kate  Fisher to open a theatre at Pittsburgh, and that Hemmings was to be the  manager. She had given them, from time to time, money obtained from  Barnard's pawn office, through the instrumentality of the unfortunate  Hemmings.    That is the history; that is all before you, and it cannot be gainsayed.  Then why the arrest this time more than at the others? It explains  itself. You have it in testimony that these ear-rings were the property  of Mr. Lynch, and that Mrs. Lynch had loaned them to Mrs. Bethune.  Hemmings alleges, and I believe with truth, that Mrs. Bethune, whilst  riding in a coach with him, and after a \"love encounter\" (laughter) gave  to him these jewels to hypothecate in the place to which he had been a  frequent visitor for Mrs. Bethune. He goes to this pawnbroker's not in  his own name, but, as the pawnbroker tells you (and I point to that fact  as one of the strong points in the defense), that he panned them with  him, telling him at the time that they belonged to Mrs. Bethune. Would a  thief who stole your property or mine go to a place where he was known,  that is if he stole them with the intention of keeping them? There was  no larceny here, no dishonest motive about the transaction. Would he go  to the pawnbroker to whom he was known and say, \"Here is some property;  it is not mine, it is Mrs. Bethune's?\" On the contrary, you know,  gentlemen--you must know--that there are a thousand other pawnbroker's  establishments in New York City; and if this had been a felonious taking  of these ear-rings, Hemmings could have gone to Simpson's across the way  from this court house, or to another place at the Battery, or east,  west, north or south, upon any corner in New York to a strange  pawnbroker, who did not know him, had there been any felony about the  transaction. Another point is, that a felon who steals invariably covers  up his crime. The Prosecution brought out this fact, and I appeal to it  as their own destruction, why in the name of Heaven did this man, if he  intended to appropriate these ear-rings to his own use, carry about him  the evidence of his guilt? Why, they told you when they got to  Pittsburgh, after the altercation, that he produced the pawn-ticket! Did  that look like stealing?    But to revert to the ownership. Mr. Lynch, in a moment of kindness,  loaned these ear-rings to his wife. Mrs. Lynch again loaned them to Mrs.  Bethune; and, as Hemmings says, whilst riding in a coach, she (Mrs.  Bethune) gave him those ear-rings to pledge. He did so pledge them. Mind  you, gentlemen, there has been no dispute about that since the  commencement; he has never denied the pledging. Having pledged them, as  he represents, a request was made to Mrs. Bethune for the return of the  ear-rings. She could not produce them, and for the best possible reason;  and not until nearly two months after the occurrence is the complaint  made before the police magistrate. She wished to hide from Mr. Bethune  (the gentleman who sustained the relation of husband to her) what had  become of the ear-rings; and, necessarily, she had no resort but to turn  round and say: \"It is not very pleasant to tell my husband (or the man  who stands in that capacity) that I have given those ear-rings to a  lover! I cannot, without offending you, tell you the true cause of this  affair, but I must, in order to save myself, say, O, this George stole  them, and he is in Pittsburgh with Kate Fisher.\" This is _two months_  after the occurrence! And then, on the first of December, a requisition  is gotten out, and the more marvelous part of it is, that she goes on  alone in the first instance while Mr. Bethune followed subsequently. Now  see what occurred in Pittsburgh. She told you she did not know whether  he was arrested or not. She \"believed\" there was a form gone through of  getting out some papers. She \"believes\" she was taken before the mayor;  and what became of the case she did not know. But Mr. Bethune, who could  not shield himself in this way, very promptly answered that he was  arrested at the suit of this man; and Hemmings could not make idle  charges there. He was a theatrical manager in Pittsburgh, a public man!  and, as they told you, boasted that he was intimate with the members of  the press and police force, who were dead-heads at his theatre, and who  witnessed the performance gratuitously; so that you perceive he was very  well known. Do you believe, will any sane man of common sense credit the  statement, that a man who was as well known in Pittsburgh as G. L. Fox  is in this city, could afford to arrest a citizen and have the matter  made public unless he had reasons to do so?    I say, gentlemen, that the entire case, from the commencement to the  end, abounds in doubts suggestive of this man's innocence, especially  the fact which cannot be denied, that this lady, _she is not like  Caesar's wife_, above suspicion, shields herself, as no honest woman  would, behind that protection which the judge afforded.    Good God, gentlemen, in a court of justice, where jurors are empanelled  to decide upon the future prospects and the life of this young man,  would your wife or mine refuse to answer such a question? Is it a  _shame_ for us to acknowledge that the holy bonds of matrimony have  united us with a being--the mother of our offspring? Would you deny that  you were the husband of a lady, placed upon the witness stand to support  a charge against a thief for having stolen your watch? Why, I think,  gentlemen, that honor, affection, duty and every obligation known to  society, demands, in imperious tones, that instead of denying the wife  of your bosom, you stand forward as her champion and say, \"Thank God,  she is my wife and I am proud of it!\" That is what you or I would have  answered. But the gauzy curtain that was covered over this foul tableau,  has been lifted up, and you see it in all it hideous deformity. As I  have before stated, you have seen, gentlemen, the flimsy evidence upon  which is attempted to predicate a conviction for grand larceny. I am  confident that in spite of all the attempts that have been made by a  shameless wanton and her pretended husband, to crush this man, despite  the meretricious trickery and villainous conspiracy which instigated,  concocted and carried out this _persecution_, relying as I do, on your  sense of justice, your strict integrity, and the independence of an  American jury, that you will not permit our temples erected to justice,  to be prostituted to the accomplishment of the designs of the polluted  and the infamous and that innocence will triumph, and your verdict be  \"Not guilty.\"    At the conclusion of Mr. Howe's address, Mr. Hutchings summed up for the  people. Judge Russel proceeded to charge the jury. After recapitulating  very carefully the whole of the testimony, told them that if they were  satisfied that the prisoner Hemmings had taken these ear-rings from Mrs.  Bethune, and had pledged them without her consent, then they should  convict; but if they had any well-founded doubt arising from the  testimony itself, and not engendered by the eloquent speech of the  prisoner's counsel, then they should give the prisoner the benefit of  the doubt and acquit him.    The jury then retired, and after a quarter of an hour's absence returned  into court and rendered a verdict of NOT GUILTY.    Hemmings was accordingly discharged, and he quitted the court amidst the  congratulations of his friends.    Mrs. Bethune also brought a charge of theft against Kate Fisher, which  was heard at Essex Market Police Court. The New York _Herald_ reported  the proceedings next day as follows:    Essex Market court-room was this afternoon densely crowded with  theatrical personages of all grades, apparently deeply interested in the  progress of the case which concerns the position and honor of an actress  so well known as Kate Fisher. The seats of the court would not contain  more than half the number of the persons present, the remainder being  compelled to stand around against the walls and in the nooks of the  doors, etc. Among those present were W. B. Freligh, manager of the  Bowery Theatre; John Jones, the treasurer; Clark, the stage manager;  Deane, leader of the orchestra, and others. The court-room was at last  found to be too small, and the whole party adjourned to examine the room  on the second floor of the building, which was also found to be rather  small, but yet more convenient for the purposes of an examination.    Justice Shandley then took his seat on the bench, and the parties  concerned appeared in court. Mrs. Bethune was rather flashily dressed,  and evidently intended to make a show. Kate Fisher was quietly dressed  in black, and was very modest in her demeanor; attracting no attention,  except from those who were acquainted with her. Mr. Bethune accompanied  the complainant, and Messrs. Howe and Hummel, appeared for Miss Kate  Fisher.    Having taken their respective seats, the case of Eliza Bethune, of  Centreville, Long Island, against Kate Fisher, for the larceny of a gold  watch and chain, valued at $200, was then called on.    Mrs. Bethune, the first witness, was then examined by her counsel. She  stated that her name was Eliza Bethune, and that she resided at  Centreville, L. I. She knew Kate Fisher, and knew her on the 16th of  last November. She was then living in East Fourth street. On that day  she missed her watch, and her daughter told her that Miss Fisher had  taken it. Acting on this information, she sent for Kate Fisher on the  afternoon of that day. Mrs. Bethune then asked her where her watch was.  Kate Fisher was very much intoxicated at the time, but understood all  that was "]]]
