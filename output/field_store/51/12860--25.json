When the dwarf saw him going he thought of the little princess in the  lonely moor, and his courage came back, and he answered bravely:    \"Yes, I am ready.\"    The water-steeds, hearing his answer, and snorting with rage, struck the  shore with their pounding hoofs.    \"Back to your waves!\" cried the little harper; and as he ran his fingers  across his lyre, the frightened steeds drew back into the waters.    \"What is the price?\" asked the dwarf.    \"Your right eye,\" said the fairy; and before the dwarf could say  a word, the fairy scooped out the eye with his finger, and put it  into his pocket.    The dwarf suffered most terrible agony; but he resolved to bear it for  the sake of the little princess. Then the fairy sat down on a rock at  the edge of the sea, and, after striking a few notes, he began to play  the \"Strains of Slumber.\"    The sound crept along the waters, and the steeds, so ferocious a moment  before, became perfectly still. They had no longer any motion of their  own, and they floated on the top of the tide like foam before a breeze.    \"Now,\" said the fairy, as he led the dwarf's horse to the edge of the  tide.    The dwarf urged the horse into the water, and once out of his depth, the  old horse struck out boldly for the island. The sleeping water-steeds  drifted helplessly against him, and in a short time he reached the  island safely, and he neighed joyously as his hoofs touched solid  ground.    The dwarf rode on and on, until he came to a bridle-path, and following  this, it led him up through winding lanes, bordered with golden furze  that filled the air with fragrance, and brought him to the summit of the  green hills that girdled and looked down on the Mystic Lake. Here the  horse stopped of his own accord, and the dwarf's heart beat quickly as  his eye rested on the lake, that, clipped round by the ring of hills,  seemed in the breezeless and sunlit air--           \"As still as death.    And as bright as life can be.\"      After gazing at it for a long time, he dismounted, and lay at his ease  in the pleasant grass. Hour after hour passed, but no change came over  the face of the waters, and when the night fell sleep closed the eyelids  of the dwarf.    The song of the lark awoke him in the early morning, and, starting up,  he looked at the lake, but its waters were as bright as they had been  the day before.    Towards midday he beheld what he thought was a black cloud sailing  across the sky from east to west. It seemed to grow larger as it came  nearer and nearer, and when it was high above the lake he saw it was  a huge bird, the shadow of whose outstretched wings darkened the waters  of the lake; and the dwarf knew it was one of the Cormorants of the  Western Seas. As it descended slowly, he saw that it held in one of its  claws a branch of a tree larger than a full-grown oak, and laden with  clusters of ripe red berries. It alighted at some distance from the  dwarf, and, after resting for a time, it began to eat the berries and to  throw the stones into the lake, and wherever a stone fell a bright red  stain appeared in the water. As he looked more closely at the bird the  dwarf saw that it had all the signs of old age, and he could not help  wondering how it was able to carry such a heavy tree.    Later in the day, two other birds, as large as the first, but younger,  came up from the west and settled down beside him. They also ate the  berries, and throwing the stones into the lake it was soon as red as  wine.    When they had eaten all the berries, the young birds began to pick the  decayed feathers off the old bird and to smooth his plumage. As soon as  they had completed their task, he rose slowly from the hill and sailed  out over the lake, and dropping down on the waters, dived beneath them.  In a moment he came to the surface, and shot up into the air with a  joyous cry, and flew off to the west in all the vigor of renewed youth,  followed by the other birds.    When they had gone so far that they were like specks in the sky, the  dwarf mounted his horse and descended towards the lake.    He was almost at the margin, and in another minute would have plunged  in, when he heard a fierce screaming in the air, and before he had time  to look up, the three birds were hovering over the lake.    The dwarf drew back frightened.    The birds wheeled over his head, and then, swooping down, they flew  close to the water, covering it with their wings, and uttering harsh  cries.    Then, rising to a great height, they folded their wings and dropped  headlong, like three rocks, on the lake, crashing its surface, and  scattering a wine-red shower upon the hills.[12]    Then the dwarf remembered what the fairy told him, that if he attempted  to swim the lake, without paying the price, the three Cormorants of the  Western Seas would pick the flesh off his bones. He knew not what to do,  and was about to turn away, when he heard once more the twang of the  golden harp, and the little fairy of the hills stood before him.    \"Faint heart never won fair lady,\" said the little harper. \"Are you  ready to pay the price? The spear and shield are on the opposite bank,  and the Princess Finola is crying this moment in the lonely moor.\"    At the mention of Finola's name the dwarf's heart grew strong.    \"Yes,\" he said; \"I am ready--win or die. What is the price?\"    \"Your left eye,\" said the fairy. And as soon as said he scooped out the  eye, and put it in his pocket.    The poor blind dwarf almost fainted with pain.    \"It's your last trial,\" said the fairy, \"and now do what I tell you.  Twist your horse's mane round your right hand, and I will lead him to  the water. Plunge in, and fear not. I gave you back your speech. When  you reach the opposite bank you will get back your memory, and you will  know who and what you are.\"    Then the fairy led the horse to the margin of the lake.    \"In with you now, and good luck go with you,\" said the fairy.    The dwarf urged the horse. He plunged into the lake, and went down  and down until his feet struck the bottom. Then he began to ascend,  and as he came near the surface of the water the dwarf thought he saw  a glimmering light, and when he rose above the water he saw the bright  sun shining and the green hills before him, and he shouted with joy at  finding his sight restored.    But he saw more. Instead of the old horse he had ridden into the lake he  was bestride a noble steed, and as the steed swam to the bank the dwarf  felt a change coming over himself, and an unknown vigor in his limbs.    When the steed touched the shore he galloped up the hillside, and on the  top of the hill was a silver shield, bright as the sun, resting against  a spear standing upright in the ground.    The dwarf jumped off, and, running towards the shield, he saw himself as  in a looking-glass.    He was no longer a dwarf, but a gallant knight. At that moment his  memory came back to him, and he knew he was Conal, one of the Knights  of the Red Branch, and he remembered now that the spell of dumbness  and deformity had been cast upon him by the Witch of the Palace of the  Quicken Trees.    Slinging his shield upon his left arm, he plucked the spear from the  ground and leaped on to his horse. With a light heart he swam back over  the lake, and nowhere could he see the black Cormorants of the Western  Seas, but three white swans floating abreast followed him to the bank.  When he reached the bank he galloped down to the sea, and crossed to the  shore.    Then he flung the reins upon his horse's neck, and swifter than the wind  the gallant horse swept on and on, and it was not long until he was  bounding over the enchanted moor. Wherever his hoofs struck the ground,  grass and flowers sprang up, and great trees with leafy branches rose on  every side.    At last the knight reached the little hut. Three times he struck the  shield with the haft and three times with the blade of his spear. At  the last blow the hut disappeared, and standing before him was the  little princess.    [Illustration: \"Standing before him was the little princess\"]    The knight took her in his arms and kissed her; then he lifted her on to  the horse, and, leaping up before her, he turned towards the north, to  the palace of the Red Branch Knights, and as they rode on beneath the  leafy trees from every tree the birds sang out, for the spell of silence  over the lonely moor was broken for ever.          NOTES      I    _Liban the Mermaid_    Liban was the daughter of Ecca, son of Mario, King of Munster. Ecca,  having conquered the lordship of the half of Ulster, settled down with  his people in the plain of the Gray Copse, which is now covered by the  waters of Lough Necca, now Lough Neagh. A magic well had sprung up in  the plain, and not being properly looked after by the woman in charge of  it, its waters burst forth over the plain, drowning Ecca and nearly all  his family. Liban, although swept away like the others, was not drowned.  She lived for a whole year, with her lap-dog, in a chamber beneath the  lake, and God protected her from the water. At the end of that time she  was weary, and when she saw the speckled salmon swimming and playing all  round her, she prayed to be changed into a salmon that she might swim  with the others through the green, salt sea. Her prayer was granted; she  took the shape of a salmon, except her face and breast, which did not  change. And her lap-dog was changed into an otter, and attended her  afterwards whithersoever she went as long as she lived in the sea.    It is nearly eight hundred years ago since the story was transcribed  from some old authority into the \"Book of the Dun Cow,\" the oldest  manuscript of Gaelic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#19)"],[1," of St. John before he was of age, and a defender of  Rhodes forty-three years ago, though now an old man retained to the  full the courage and generalship which had made his career as  commander of the galleys memorable in the annals of Mediterranean  wars. He had been a captive among the Turks, and knew their languages  and their modes of warfare; and his sufferings had increased his  hatred of the Infidel. A tall, handsome man, with an air of calm  resolution, he communicated his iron nerve to all his followers. Cold  and even cruel in his severity, he was yet devoutly religious, and  passionately devoted to his Order and his Faith. A true hero, but of  the reasoning, merciless, bigoted sort: not the generous, reckless  enthusiast who inspires by sympathy and glowing example.    When he knew that the day of trial was at hand, Jean de la Valette  assembled the Order together, and bade them first be reconciled with  God and one another, and then prepare to lay down their lives for the  Faith they had sworn to defend. Before the altar each Knight foreswore  all enmities, renounced all pleasures, buried all ambitions; and  joining together in the sacred fellowship of the Supper of the Lord,  once more dedicated their blood to the service of the Cross.    At the very outset a grave mischance befell the Turks; Dragut was a  fortnight late at the rendezvous. His voice would have enforced  Pi[=a]li's advice, to land the entire force and attack the Burg and  St. Michael from the heights behind. Mustafa, the Seraskier, was  determined to reduce the outlying Fort of St. Elmo on the promontory  of Sceberras before attacking the main position, and accordingly  landed his men at his convenience from the Marsa Muset, and laid out  his earthworks on the land side of St. Elmo. He had not long begun  when Ochiali arrived with six galleys from Alexandria, and on June 2nd  came Dragut himself with a score or more galleys of Tripoli and Bona.  Dragut saw at once the mistake that had been made, but saw also that  to abandon the siege of St. Elmo would too greatly elate the Knights:  the work must go on; and on it went with unexampled zeal.    The little fort could hold but a small garrison, but the force was a  _corps d'elite_: De Broglio of Piedmont commanded it with sixty  soldiers, and was supported by Juan de Guaras, bailiff of the  Negropont, a splendid old Knight, followed by sixty more of the  Order, and some Spaniards under Juan de la Cerda:--a few hundred of  men to meet thirty thousand Turks, but men of no common mettle. They  had not long to wait. The fire opened from twenty-one guns on the last  day of May and continued with little intermission till June 23rd. The  besiegers were confident of battering down the little fort in a week  at most, but they did not know their foes. As soon as one wall  crumbled before the cannonade, a new work appeared behind it. The  first assault lasted three hours, and the Turks gained possession of  the ravelin in front of the gate; so furious was the onset that the  defenders sent to the Grand Master to tell him the position was  untenable; they could not stand a second storming party. La Valette  replied that, if so, he would come and withstand it himself: St. Elmo  must be held to keep the Turks back till reinforcements arrived. So of  course they went on. Dragut brought up some of his largest yards and  laid them like a bridge across the fosse, and a tremendous struggle  raged for five terrible hours on Dragut's bridge. Again and again  Mustafa marshalled his Janissaries for the attack, and every time they  were hurled back with deadly slaughter. As many as four thousand Turks  fell in a single assault. St. Elmo was little more than a heap of  ruins, but the garrison still stood undaunted among the heaps of  stones, each man ready to sell his life dearly for the honour of Our  Lady and St. John.    The Turks at last remedied the mistake they had made at the beginning.  They had left the communication between St. Elmo and the harbour  unimpeded, and reinforcements had frequently been introduced into the  besieged fortress from the Burg. On June 17th the line of  circumvallation was pushed to the harbour's edge, and St. Elmo was  completely isolated. Yet this prudent precaution was more than  outweighed by the heavy loss that accompanied its execution: for  Dragut was struck down while directing the engineers, and the surgeons  pronounced the wound mortal. With the cool courage of his nation,  Mustafa cast a cloak over the prostrate form, and stood in Dragut's  place.    Five days later came the final assault. On the eve of June 23rd, after  the cannonade had raged all the forenoon, and a hand-to-hand fight had  lasted till the evening, when two thousand of the enemy and five  hundred of the scanty garrison had fallen, the Knights and their  soldiers prepared for the end. They knew the Grand Master could not  save them, that nothing could avert the inevitable dawn. They took the  Sacrament from each other's hands, and \"committing their souls to God  made ready to devote their bodies in the cause of His Blessed Son.\" It  was a forlorn and sickly remnant of the proudest chivalry the world  has ever known, that met the conquering Turks that June morning: worn  and haggard faces, pale with long vigils and open wounds; tottering  frames that scarce could stand; some even for very weakness seated in  chairs, with drawn swords, within the breach. But weary and sick,  upright or seated, all bore themselves with unflinching courage; in  every set face was read the resolve to die hard.    The ghastly struggle was soon over: the weight of the Turkish column  bore down everything in its furious rush. Knights and soldiers alike  rolled upon the ground, every inch of which they had disputed to the  last drop of their blood. Not a man escaped.    Dragut heard of the fall of St. Elmo as he lay in his tent dying, and  said his Moslem _Nunc Dimittis_ with a thankful heart. He had been  struck at the soldier's post of duty; he died with the shout of  victory ringing in his ears, as every general would wish to die. His  figure stands apart from all the men of his age:--an admiral, the  equal of Barbarossa, the superior of Doria; a general fit to marshal  troops against any of the great leaders of the armies of Charles V.;  he was content with the eager rush of his life, and asked not for  sovereignty or honours. Humane to his prisoners, a gay comrade, an  inspiriting commander, a seaman every inch, Dragut is the most vivid  and original personage among the Corsairs.    St. Elmo had fallen: but St. Angelo and St. Michael stood untouched.  Three hundred Knights of St. John and thirteen hundred soldiers had  indeed fallen in the first, but its capture had closed the lives of  eight thousand Turks. \"If the child has cost us so dear,\" said  Mustafa, \"what will the parent cost?\" The Turkish general sent a flag  of truce to La Valette, to propose terms of capitulation, but in vain.  Mutual animosity had been worked to a height of indignant passion by a  barbarous massacre of prisoners on both sides, each in view of the  other. The Grand Master's first impulse was to hang the messenger of  such foes: he thought better of it, and showed him the depth of the  ditch that encircled the twin forts: \"Let your Janissaries come and  take that,\" he said, and contemptuously dismissed him.    A new siege now began. The forts on the east of La Marsa had been  sorely drained to fill up the gaps in the garrison at St. Elmo, and it  was fortunate that Don Juan de Cardona had been able to send a  reinforcement, though only of six hundred men, under Melchior de  Robles, to the Old Town, whence they contrived to reach Fort St.  Michael in safety.[45] Even six hundred men added materially to the  difficulties of the siege: for, be it remembered, six hundred men  behind skilfully constructed fortifications may be worth six thousand  in the open. It was very hard for the besiegers to find cover. The  ground was hard rock, and cutting trenches was extremely arduous work,  and the noise of the picks directed the fire of the forts by night  upon the sappers. Nevertheless by July 5th four batteries were playing  upon St. Michael from the heights of St. Margaret and Conradin, while  the guns of Fort St. Elmo opened from the other side; and soon a line  of cannon on Mount Salvador dominated the English Port. An attempt to  bring a flotilla of gun-boats into the Harbour of the Galleys failed,  after a vigorous conflict between a party of Turkish swimmers, who  strove with axes to cut the chain that barred the port, and some  Maltese who swam to oppose them, sword in teeth. The battle in the  water ended in the flight of the Turks.    [Illustration: SKETCH OF THE PORT OF MALTA IN 1565.]    Ten distinct general assaults were delivered with all the fury of  Janissaries against the stronghold. First, a grand assault by sea was  ordered on July 15th. Three columns simultaneously advanced by night  on Fort St. Michael: one landed in the Arenela and marched to attack  the eastern suburb La Bormula; the second came down from the heights  of St. Margaret and made straight for the bastion defended by De  Robles; the third advanced from Conradin on the south-west, and  assaulted the salient angle at the extreme point of the spit of land  on which the fort was built. In vain the Turks swarmed up the  scaling-ladders; company after company was hurled down, a huddled mass  of mangled flesh, and the ladders were cast off. Again the escalade  began:--the Knights rolled huge blocks of masonry on the crowded  throng below; when they got within arms' reach the scimitar was no  match for the long two-handed swords of the Christians. At all three  points after a splendid attack, which called forth all the finest  qualities of the magnificent soldiery of Suleym[=a]n the Great, the  Turks were repulsed with terrible loss. The Knights lost some of their"]]]
