The great crater _Gassendi_ has been very frequently mapped on  account of its elaborate system of \"clefts.\" At its northern end it  communicates with a smaller but much deeper crater, that is often filled  with black shadow after the whole floor of Gassendi has been  illuminated.    15. _Schickard_ is one of the largest walled plains on the moon, about  134 miles in breadth. Within its vast expanse Maedler detected 23 minor  craters. With regard to this object Chacornac pointed out that, owing to  the curvature of the surface of the moon, a spectator at the centre of  the floor \"would think himself in a boundless desert,\" because the  surrounding wall, although in one place nearly 10,000 feet high, would  lie entirely beneath his horizon.    16. Close to the foregoing is _Wargentin_. There can be little doubt  that this is really a huge crater almost filled with congealed lava, as  there is scarcely any fall towards the interior.    17. _Clavius._--Near the 60th parallel of lunar south latitude lies  this enormous enclosure, the area of which is not less than 16,500  square miles. Both in its interior and on its walls are many peaks and  secondary craters. The telescopic view of a sunrise upon the surface of  Clavius is truly said by Maedler to be indescribably magnificent. One of  the peaks rises to a height of 24,000 feet above the bottom of one of  the included craters. Maedler even expressed the opinion that in this  wild neighbourhood there are craters so profound that no ray of sunlight  ever penetrated their lowest depths, while, as if in compensation, there  are peaks whose summits enjoy a mean day almost twice as long as their  night.    18. If the full moon be viewed through an opera-glass or any small  hand-telescope, one crater is immediately seen to be conspicuous beyond  all others, by reason of the brilliant rays or streaks that radiate from  it. This is the majestic _Tycho_, 17,000 feet in depth and 50 miles in  diameter (Plate X.). A peak 6,000 feet in height rises in the centre of  its floor, while a series of terraces diversity its interior slopes; but  it is the mysterious bright rays that chiefly surprise us. When the sun  rises on Tycho, these streaks are utterly invisible; indeed, the whole  object is then so obscure that it requires a practised eye to recognise  Tycho amidst its mountainous surroundings. But as soon as the sun has  attained a height of about 30 deg. above its horizon, the rays emerge from  their obscurity and gradually increase in brightness until the moon  becomes full, when they are the most conspicuous objects on her surface.  They vary in length, from a few hundred miles to two or, in one  instance, nearly three thousand miles. They extend indifferently across  vast plains, into the deepest craters, or over the loftiest elevations.  We know of nothing on our earth to which they can be compared. As these  rays are only seen about the time of full moon, their visibility  obviously depends on the light falling more or less closely in the line  of sight, quite regardless of the inclination of the surfaces, mountains  or valleys, on which they appear. Each small portion of the surface of  the streak must therefore be of a form which is symmetrical to the  spectator from whatever point it is seen. The sphere alone appears to  fulfil this condition, and Professor Copeland therefore suggests that  the material constituting the surface of the streak must be made up of a  large number of more or less completely spherical globules. The streaks  must represent parts of the lunar surface either pitted with minute  cavities of spherical figure, or strewn over with minute transparent  spheres.[8]    Near the centre of the moon's disc is a fine range of ring plains fully  open to our view under all illuminations. Of these, two may be  mentioned--_Alphonsus_ (19), the floor of which is strangely  characterised by two bright and several dark markings which cannot be  explained by irregularities in the surface.--_Ptolemy_ (20). Besides  several small enclosed craters, its floor is crossed by numerous low  ridges, visible when the sun is rising or setting.    21, 22, 23.--When the moon is five or six days old this beautiful group  of three craters will be favourably placed for observation. They are  named _Catharina_, _Cyrillus_, and _Theophilus_. Catharina, the most  southerly of the group, is more than 16,000 feet deep, and connected  with Cyrillus by a wide valley; but between Cyrillus and Theophilus  there is no such connection. Indeed, Cyrillus looks as if its huge  surrounding ramparts, as high as Mont Blanc, had been completely  finished before the volcanic forces commenced the formation of  Theophilus, the rampart of which encroaches considerably on its older  neighbour. Theophilus stands as a well-defined circular crater about 64  miles in diameter, with an internal depth of 14,000 to 18,000 feet, and  a beautiful central group of mountains, one-third of that height, on its  floor. Although Theophilus is the deepest crater we can see in the moon,  it has suffered little or no deformation from secondary eruptions, while  the floor and wall of Catharina show complete sequences of lesser  craters of various sizes that have broken in upon and partly destroyed  each other. In the spring of the year, when the moon is somewhat before  the first quarter, this instructive group of extinct volcanoes can be  seen to great advantage at a convenient hour in the evening.    [Illustration: PLATE VII.    TRIESNECKER.    (AFTER NASMYTH.)]    24. _Petavius_ is remarkable not only for its great size, but also for  the rare feature of having a double rampart. It is a beautiful object  soon after new moon, or just after full moon, but disappears absolutely  when the sun is more than 45 deg. above its horizon. The crater floor is  remarkably convex, culminating in a central group of hills intersected  by a deep cleft.    25. _Hyginus_ is a small crater near the centre of the moon's disc. One  of the largest of the lunar chasms passes right through it, making an  abrupt turn as it does so.    26. _Triesnecker._--This fine crater has been already described, but is  again alluded to in order to draw attention to the elaborate system of  chasms so conspicuously shown in Plate VII. That these chasms are  depressions is abundantly evident by the shadows inside. Very often  their margins are appreciably raised. They seem to be fractures in the  moon's surface.    Of the various mountains that are occasionally seen as projections on  the actual edge of the moon, those called after Leibnitz (_i_) seem to  be the highest. Schmidt found the highest peak to be upwards of 41,900  feet above a neighbouring valley. In comparing these altitudes with  those of mountains on our earth, we must for the latter add the depth of  the sea to the height of the land. Reckoned in this way, our highest  mountains are still higher than any we know of in the moon.    We must now discuss the important question as to the origin of these  remarkable features on the surface of the moon. We shall admit at the  outset that our evidence on this subject is only indirect. To establish  by unimpeachable evidence the volcanic origin of the remarkable lunar  craters, it would seem almost necessary that volcanic outbursts should  have been witnessed on the moon, and that such outbursts should have  been seen to result in the formation of the well-known ring, with or  without the mountain rising from the centre. To say that nothing of the  kind has ever been witnessed would be rather too emphatic a statement.  On certain occasions careful observers have reported the occurrence of  minute local changes on the moon. As we have already remarked, a crater  named Linne, of dimensions respectable, no doubt, to a lunar inhabitant,  but forming a very inconsiderable telescopic object, was thought to have  undergone some change. On another occasion a minute crater was thought  to have arisen near the well-known object named Hyginus. The mere  enumeration of such instances gives real emphasis to the statement that  there is at the present time no appreciable source of disturbance of the  moon's surface. Even were these trifling cases of suspected change  really established--and this is perhaps rather farther than many  astronomers would be willing to go--they are still insignificant when  compared with the mighty phenomena that gave rise to the host of great  craters which cover so large a portion of the moon's surface.    We are led inevitably to the conclusion that our satellite must have  once possessed much greater activity than it now displays. We can also  give a reasonable, or, at all events, a plausible, explanation of the  cessation of that activity in recent times. Let us glance at two other  bodies of our system, the earth and the sun, and compare them with the  moon. Of the three bodies, the sun is enormously the largest, while the  moon is much less than the earth. We have also seen that though the sun  must have a very high temperature, there can be no doubt that it is  gradually parting with its heat. The surface of the earth, formed as it  is of solid rocks and clay, or covered in great part by the vast expanse  of ocean, bears but few obvious traces of a high temperature.  Nevertheless, it is highly probable from ordinary volcanic phenomena  that the interior of the earth still possesses a temperature of  incandescence.    A large body when heated takes a longer time to cool than does a small  body raised to the same temperature. A large iron casting will take days  to cool; a small casting will become cold in a few hours. Whatever may  have been the original source of heat in our system--a question which  we are not now discussing--it seems demonstrable that the different  bodies were all originally heated, and have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#19)"],[1,"al. Cavalier  now also employed it as a hospital, and had the wounded carried there,  that their wounds might receive attention.    Unfortunately, Cavalier was soon obliged to quit the forest, in spite of  his hopes of being left in peace; for one day on his way back from a  visit to the wounded in the cave, whose existence was a secret, he came  across a hundred miquelets who had penetrated thus far, and who would  have taken him prisoner if he had not, with his, accustomed presence of  mind and courage, sprung from a rock twenty feet high. The miquelets  fired at him, but no bullet reached him. Cavalier rejoined his troops,  but fearing to attract the rest of the royalists to the  place,--retreated to some distance from the cave, as it was of the  utmost importance that it should not be discovered, since it contained  all his resources.    Cavalier had now reached one of those moments when Fortune, tired of  conferring favours, turns her back on the favourite. The royalists had  often noticed an old woman from the village of Hieuzet going towards the  forest, sometimes carrying a basket in her hand, sometimes with a hamper  on her head, and it occurred to them that she was supplying the hidden  Camisards with provisions. She was arrested and brought before General  Lalande, who began his examination by threatening that he would have her  hanged if she did not at once declare the object of her frequent  journeys to the forest without reserve. At first she made use of all  kinds of pretexts, which only strengthened the suspicions of Lalande,  who, ceasing his questions, ordered her to be taken to the gallows and  hanged. The old woman walked to the place of execution with such a firm  step that the general began to think he would get no information from  her, but at the foot of the ladder her courage failed. She asked to be  taken back before the general, and having been promised her life, she  revealed everything.    M de Lalande put himself at once at the head of a strong detachment of  miquelets, and forced the woman to walk before them till they reached  the cavern, which they never would have discovered without a guide, so  cleverly was the entrance hidden by rocks and brushwood. On entering,  the first thing that met their eye was the wounded, about thirty in  number. The miquelets threw themselves upon them and slaughtered them.  This deed accomplished, they went farther into the cave, which to their  great surprise contained a thousand things they never expected to find  there--heaps of grain, sacks of flour, barrels of wine, casks of brandy,  quantities of chestnuts and potatoes; and besides all this, chests  containing ointments, drugs and lint, and lastly a complete arsenal of  muskets, swords, and bayonets, a quantity of powder ready-made, and  sulphur, saltpetre, and charcoal-in short, everything necessary for the  manufacture of more, down to small mills to be turned by hand. Lalande  kept his word: the life of an old woman was not too much to give in  return for such a treasure.    Meantime M. de Villars, as he had promised, took up Baron d'Aygaliers in  passing through Lyons, so that during the rest of the journey the  peacemaker had plenty of time to expatiate on his plans. As M. de  Villars was a man of tact and a lover of justice, and desired above all  things to bring a right spirit to bear on the performance of the duties  of his new office, in which his two predecessors had failed, he promised  the baron \"to keep,\" as he expressed himself, his \"two ears open\" and  listen to both sides, and as a first proof of impartiality--he refused  to give any opinion until he had heard M. de Julien, who was coming to  meet him at Tournon.    When they arrived at Tournon, M. de Julien was there to receive them,  and had a very different story to tell from that which M. de Villars had  heard from d'Aygaliers. According to him, the only pacific ration  possible was the complete extermination of the Camisards. He felt  himself very hardly treated in that he had been allowed to destroy only  four hundred villages and hamlets in the Upper Cevennes,--assuring de  Villars with the confidence of a man who had studied the matter  profoundly, that they should all have been demolished without exception,  and all the peasants killed to the last man.    So it came to pass that M. de Villars arrived at Beaucaire placed like  Don Juan between the spirits of good and evil, the one advising clemency  and the other murder. M. de Villars not being able to make up his mind,  on reaching Nimes, d'Aygaliers assembled the principal Protestants of  the town, told them of his plan, showing them its practicability, so  that also joined in the good work, and drew up a document in which they  asked the marechal to allow them to take up arms and march against the  rebels, as they were determined either to bring them back into the good  way by force of example or to fight them as a proof of their loyalty.    This petition, which was signed by several nobles and by almost all the  lawyers and merchants of the city of Nimes, was presented to M. de  Villars on Tuesday, 22nd April, 1704, by M. de Albenas, at the head of  seven or eight hundred persons of the Reformed religion. M. de Villars  received the request kindly, thanked its bearer and those who  accompanied him, assuring them that he had no doubt of the sincerity of  their professions, and that if he were in want of help he would have  recourse to them with as much confidence as if they were old Catholics.  He hoped, however, to win the rebels back by mildness, and he begged  them to second his efforts in this direction by spreading abroad the  fact that an amnesty was offered to all those who would lay down arms  and return to their houses within a week. The very next day but one, M.  de Villars set out from Nimes to visit all the principal towns, in order  to make himself acquainted with men, things, and places.    Although the answer to the petition had been a delicate refusal,  d'Aygaliers was not discouraged, but followed M. de Villars everywhere.  When the latter arrived at Alais, the new governor sent for MM. de  Lalande and de Baville, in order to consult them as to the best means of  inducing the Camisards to lay down their arms. Baron d'Aygaliers was  summoned to this consultation, and described his plan to the two  gentlemen. As he expected, both were opposed to it; however, he tried to  bring them over to his side by presenting to them what seemed to him to  be cogent reasons for its adoption. But de Lalande and de Baville made  light of all his reasons, and rejected his proposals with such  vehemence, that the marechal, however much inclined to the side of  d'Aygaliers, did not venture to act quite alone, and said he would not  decide on any course until he reached Uzes.    D'Aygaliers saw clearly that until he had obtained the approbation of  either the general or the intendant, he would get nothing from the  marechal. He therefore considered which of the two he should try to  persuade, and although de Baville was his personal enemy, having several  times shown his hatred for him and his family, he decided to address  himself to him.    In consequence, the next day, to the great astonishment of M. de  Baville, d'Aygaliers paid him a visit. The intendant received him coldly  but politely, asked him to sit down, and when he was seated begged to  know the motive which had brought him. \"Sir,\" replied the baron, \"you  have given my family and me such cause of offence that I had come to the  firm resolution never to ask a favour of you, and as perhaps you may  have remarked during the journey we have taken with M. le marechal, I  would rather have died of thirst than accept a glass of water from you.  But I have come here to-day not upon any private matter, to obtain my  own ends, but upon a matter which concerns the welfare of the State. I  therefore beg you to put out of your mind the dislike which you have to  me and mine, and I do this the more earnestly that your dislike can only  have been caused by the fact that our religion is different from  yours--a thing which could neither have been foreseen nor prevented. My  entreaty is that you do not try to set M. le marechal against the course  which I have proposed to him, which I am convinced would bring the  disorders in our province to an end, stop the occurrence of the many  unfortunate events which I am sure you look on with regret, and spare  you much trouble and embarrassment.\"    The intendant was much touched by this calm speech, and above all by the  confidence which M. d'Aygaliers had shown him, and replied that he had  only offered opposition to the plan of pacification because he believed  it to be impracticable. M. d'Aygaliers then warmly pressed him to try it  before rejecting it for ever, and in the end M. de Baville withdrew his  opposition.    M d'Aygaliers hastened to the marechal, who finding himself no longer  alone in his favourable opinion, made no further delay, but told the  baron to call together that very day all the people whom he thought  suitable for the required service, and desired that they should be  presented to him the next morning before he set out for Nimes.    The next day, instead of the fifty men whom the marachal had thought  could be gathered together, d'Aygaliers came to him followed by eighty,  who were almost all of good and many of noble family. The meeting took  place, by the wish of the baron, in the courtyard of the episcopal  palace. \"This palace,\" says the baron in his Memoirs, \"which was of  great magnificence, surrounded by terraced gardens and superbly  furnished, was occupied by Monseigneur Michel Poncet de La Riviere. He  was a man passionately devoted to pleasures of all kinds, especially to  music, women, and good cheer. There were always to be found in his house  good musicians, pretty women, and excellent wines. These latter suited  him so well that he"]]]
