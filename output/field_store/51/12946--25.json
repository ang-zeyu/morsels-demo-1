Of these the fifth, Lamech, a fierce and lawless man, had  three sons, two of whom, Jabal and Jubal, led a pastoral and nomadic  life; but the third, Tubalcain, invented the use of metals: he was \"the  forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron.\" This is what the  Chap. IV. of Genesis tells of Cain, his crime, his exile and immediate  posterity. After that they are heard of no more. Adam, meanwhile, has a  third son, born after he had lost the first two and whom he calls Seth  (more correctly _Sheth_). The descendants of this son are enumerated in  Chap. V.; the list ends with Noah. These are the parallel races: the  accursed and the blest, the proscribed of God and the loved of God, the  one that \"goes out of the presence of the Lord\" and the one that \"calls  on the name of the Lord,\" and \"walks with God.\" Of the latter race the  last-named, Noah, is \"a just man, perfect in his generation,\" and \"finds  grace in the eyes of the Lord.\"    6. Then comes the narrative of the Flood (Chap. VI.-VIII.), the covenant  of God with Noah and re-peopling of the earth by his posterity (Chap.  IX.). Lastly Chap. X. gives us the list of the generations of Noah's  three sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet;--\"of these were the nations divided in  the earth after the flood.\"    7. Now this tenth chapter of Genesis is the oldest and most important  document in existence concerning the origins of races and nations, and  comprises all those with whom the Jews, in the course of their early  history, have had any dealings, at least all those who belonged to the  great white division of mankind. But in order properly to understand it  and appreciate its value and bearing, it must not be forgotten that EACH  NAME IN THE LIST IS THAT OF A RACE, A PEOPLE OR A TRIBE, NOT THAT OF A  MAN. It was a common fashion among the Orientals--a fashion adopted also  by ancient European nations--to express in this manner the kindred  connections of nations among themselves and their differences. Both for  brevity and clearness, such historical genealogies are very convenient.  They must have been suggested by a proceeding most natural in ages of  ignorance, and which consists in a tribe's explaining its own name by  taking it for granted that it was that of its founder. Thus the name of  the Assyrians is really Asshur. Why? Clearly, they would answer, if  asked the question, because their kingdom was founded by one whose name  was Asshur. Another famous nation, the Aramaeans, are supposed to be so  called because the name of their founder was Aram; the Hebrews name  themselves from a similarly supposed ancestor, Heber. These three  nations,--and several more, the Arabs among others--spoke languages so  much alike that they could easily understand each other, and had  generally many common features in looks and character. How account for  that? By making their founders, Asshur, and Aram, and Heber, etc., sons  or descendants of one great head or progenitor, Shem, a son of Noah. It  is a kind of parable which is extremely clear once one has the key to  it, when nothing is easier than to translate it into our own sober,  positive forms of speech. The above bit of genealogy would read thus: A  large portion of humanity is distinguished by certain features more or  less peculiar to itself; it is one of several great races, and has been  called for more than a hundred years the Semitic, (better Shemitic)  race, the race of Shem. This race is composed of many different tribes  and nations, who have gone each its own way, have each its own name and  history, speak dialects of the same original language, and have  preserved many common ideas, customs and traits of character,--which all  shows that the race was once united and dwelt together, then, as it  increased in numbers, broke up into fractions, of which some rose to be  great and famous nations and some remained comparatively insignificant  tribes. The same applies to the subdivisions of the great white race  (the whitest of all) to which nearly all the European nations belong,  and which is personified in the Bible under the name of Japhet, third  son of Noah,--and to those of a third great race, also originally white,  which is broken up into very many fractions, both great nations and  scattered tribes, all exhibiting a decided likeness to each other. The  Bible gives the names of all these most carefully, and sums up the whole  of them under the name of the second son of Noah, Ham, whom it calls  their common progenitor.    8. That the genealogies of Chap. X. of Genesis should be understood in  this sense, has long been admitted by scientists and churchmen. St.  Augustine, one of the greatest among the Fathers of the early church,  pointedly says that the names in it represent \"nations, not men.\"[AA] On  the other hand there is also literal truth in them, in this way, that,  if all mankind is descended from one human couple, every fraction of it  must necessarily have had some one particular father or ancestor, only  in so remote a past that his individuality or actual name cannot  possibly have been remembered, when every people, as has been remarked  above, naturally gave him its own name. Of these names many show by  their very nature that they could not have belonged to individuals. Some  are plural, like MIZRAIM, \"the Egyptians;\" some have the article: \"_the_  AMORITE, _the_ HIVITE;\" one even is the name of a city: SIDON is called  \"the first-born of Canaan;\" now Sidon was long the greatest maritime  city of the Canaanites, who held an undisputed supremacy over the rest,  and therefore \"the first-born.\" The name means \"fisheries\"--an  appropriate one for a city on the sea, which must of course have been at  first a settlement of fishermen. \"CANAAN\" really is the name of a vast  region, inhabited by a great many nations and tribes, all differing from  each other in many ways, yet manifestly of one race, wherefore they are  called \"the sons of Canaan,\" Canaan being personified in a common  ancestor, given as one of the four sons of Ham. Modern science has, for  convenience' sake, adopted a special word for such imaginary personages,  invented to account for a nation's, tribe's, or city's name, while  summing up, so to speak, its individuality: they are called EPONYMS. The  word is Greek, and means \"one from whom or for whom somebody or  something is named,\" a \"namesake.\" It is not too much to say that, while  popular tradition always claims that the eponymous ancestor or  city-founder gave his name to his family, race, or city, the contrary is  in reality invariably the case, the name of the race or city being  transferred to him. Or, in other words, the eponym is really only that  name, transformed into a traditional person by a bold and vivid poetical  figure of speech, which, if taken for what it is, makes the beginnings  of political history wonderfully plain and easy to grasp and classify.    9. Yet, complete and correct as is the list of Chap. X., within the  limits which the writer has set to himself, it by no means exhausts the  nations of the earth. The reason of the omissions, however, is easily  seen. Among the posterity of Japhet the Greeks indeed are mentioned,  (under the name of JAVAN, which should be pronounced _Yawan_, and some  of his sons), but not a single one of the other ancient peoples of  Europe,--Germans, Italians, Celts, etc.,--who also belonged to that  race, as we, their descendants, do. But then, at the time Chap. X. was  written, these countries, from their remoteness, were outside of the  world in which the Hebrews moved, beyond their horizon, so to speak.  They either did not know them at all, or, having nothing to do with  them, did not take them into consideration. In neither case would they  have been given a place in the great list. The same may be said of  another large portion of the same race, which dwelt to the far East and  South of the Hebrews--the Hindoos, (the white conquerors of India), and  the Persians. There came a time indeed, when the latter not only came  into contact with the Jews, but were their masters; but either that was  after Chap. X. was written or the Persians were identified by the  writers with a kindred nation, the Persians' near neighbor, who had  flourished much earlier and reacted in many ways on the countries  westward of it; this nation was the MEDES, who, under the name of MADAI,  are mentioned as one of the sons of Japhet, with Javan the Greek.    10. More noticeable and more significant than these partial omissions is  the determination with which the authors of Chap. X. consistently ignore  all those divisions of mankind which do not belong to one of the three  great _white_ races. Neither the Black nor the Yellow races are  mentioned at all; they are left without the pale of the Hebrew  brotherhood of nations. Yet the Jews, who staid three or four hundred  years in Egypt, surely learned there to know the real negro, for the  Egyptians were continually fighting with pure-blood black tribes in the  south and south-west, and bringing in thousands of black captives, who  were made to work at their great buildings and in their stone-quarries.  But these people were too utterly barbarous and devoid of all culture or  political importance to be taken into account. Besides, the Jews could  not be aware of the vast extent of the earth occupied by the black race,  since the greater part of Africa was then unknown to the world, and so  were the islands to the south of India, also Australia and its  islands--all seats of different sections of that race.    11. The same could not be said of the Yellow Race. True, its principal  representatives, the nations of the far East of Asia--the Chinese, the  Mongols and the Mandchous,--could not be known to the Hebrews at any  time of antiquity, but there were more than enough representatives of  it who could not be _un_known to them.[AB] For it was both a very old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#19)"],[1,"passages, his excess of  emphasis. The so-called Aristotelian dramatic canons, formulated by  Scaliger in his Poetic, were rigorously applied. Unity of place is  preserved in _Cleopatre_; the time of the action is reduced to twelve  hours; there are interminable monologues, choral moralities, a ghost  (in Seneca's manner), a narration of the heroine's death; of action  there is none, the stage stands still. If Jodelle's _Didon_ has some  literary merit, it has little dramatic vitality. The oratorical  energy of Grevin's _Jules Cesar_, the studies of history in _La Mort  de Daire_ and _La Mort d'Alexandre_, by Jacques de La Taille, do not  compensate their deficiency in the qualities required by the theatre.  One tragedy alone, _La Sultane_, by Gabriel Bounin (1561), amid its  violences and extravagances, shows a feeling for dramatic action and  scenic effect.    Could the mediaeval mystery and classical tragedy be reconciled? The  Protestant Reformer Beze, in his _Sacrifice d'Abraham_, attempted  something of the kind; his sacred drama is a mystery by its subject,  a tragedy in the conduct of the action. Three tragedies on the life  of David--one of them admirable in its rendering of the love of Michol,  daughter of Saul--were published in 1556 by Loys Des-Masures: the  stage arrangements are those of the mediaeval drama, but the unity  of time is observed, and chorus and semi-chorus respond in alternate  strains. No junction of dramatic systems essentially opposed proved  in the end possible. When Jean de La Taille wrote on a biblical subject  in his _Saul le Furieux_, a play remarkable for its impressive  conception and development of the character of Saul, he composed it  _selon l'art_, and in the manner of \"the old tragic authors.\" He is  uncompromising in his classical method; the mediaeval drama seemed  inartificial to him in the large concessions granted by the spectators  to the authors and actors; he would have what passes on the stage  approximate, at least, to reality; the unities were accepted not  merely on the supposed authority of Aristotle, but because they were  an aid in attaining verisimilitude.    The most eminent name in the history of French tragedy of the sixteenth  century is that of ROBERT GARNIER (1534-90). His discipleship to  Seneca was at first that of a pupil who reproduces with exaggeration  his master's errors. Sensible of the want of movement in his scenes,  he proceeded in later plays to accumulate action upon action without  reducing the action to unity. At length, in _Les Juives_ (1583), which  exhibits the revolt of the Jewish King and his punishment by  Nabuchodonosor, he attained something of true pity and terror, beauty  of characterisation, beauty of lyrical utterance in the plaintive  songs of the chorus. Garnier was assuredly a poet; but even in _Les  Juives_, the best tragedy of his century, he was not a master of  dramatic art. If anywhere he is in a true sense dramatic, it is in  his example of the new form of tragi-comedy. _Bradamante_, derived  from the _Orlando Furioso_ of Ariosto, shows not only poetic  imagination, but a certain feeling for the requirements of the  theatre.    Comedy in the sixteenth century, dating from Jodelle's _Eugene_, is  either a development of the mediaeval farce, indicated in point of  form by the retention of octosyllabic verse, or an importation from  the drama of Italy. Certain plays of Aristophanes, of Terence, of  Plautus were translated; but, in truth, classical models had little  influence. Grevin, while professing originality, really follows the  traditions of the farce. Jean de La Taille, in his prose comedy _Les  Corrivaux_, prepared the way for the easy and natural dialogue of  the comic stage. The most remarkable group of sixteenth-century  comedies are those translated in prose from the Italian, with such  obvious adaptations as might suit them to French readers, by PIERRE  DE LARIVEY (1540 to after 1611). Of the family of the Giunti, he had  gallicised his own name (_Giunti_, i.e. _Arrives_); and the  originality of his plays is of a like kind with that of his name;  they served at least to establish an Italian tradition for comedy,  which was not without an influence in the seventeenth century; they  served to advance the art of dialogue. If any comedy of the period  stands out as superior to its fellows, it is _Les Contents_ (1584),  by Odet de Turnebe, a free imitation of Italian models united with  something imported from the Spanish _Celestina_. Its intrigue is an  Italian imbroglio; but there are lively and natural scenes, such as  can but rarely be found among the predecessors of Moliere. In general  the comedy of the sixteenth century is wildly confused in plot,  conventional in its types of character, and too often as grossly  indecent as the elder farces. Before the century closed, the pastoral  drama had been discovered, and received influences from both Italy  and Spain; the soil was being prepared for that delicate flower of  poetry, but as yet its nurture was little understood, nor indeed can  it be said to have ever taken kindly to the climate of France.    While on the one hand the tendencies of the Pleiade may be described  as exotic, going forth, as they did, to capture the gifts of classical  and Italian literature, on the other hand they pleaded strenuously  that thus only could French literature attain its highest  possibilities. In the scholarship of the time, side by side with the  humanism which revived and restored the culture of Greece and Rome,  was another humanism which was essentially national. The historical  origins of France were studied for the first time with something of  a critical spirit by CLAUDE FAUCHET in his _Antiquites Gauloises et  Francoises_ (1579-1601). His _Recueil de l'Origine de la Langue et  Poesie Francoise_, in spite of its errors, was an effort towards  French philology; and in calling attention to the trouveres and their  works, Fauchet may be considered a remote master of the school of  modern literary research. ESTIENNE PASQUIER (1529-1615), the jurist  who maintained in a famous action the cause of the University against  the Jesuits, in his _Recherches de la France_ treated with learning  and vigour various important points in French history--civil and  ecclesiastical--language, literary history, and the foundation of  universities. HENRI ESTIENNE (1531-98), who entered to the full into  the intoxication of classical humanism, was patriotic in his  reverence for his native tongue. In a trilogy of little treatises  (1565-79), written with much spirit, he maintained that of modern  languages the French has the nearest affinity to the Greek, attempted  to establish its superiority to Italian, and much more to Spanish,  and mocked the contemporary fashion of Italianised French.    The study of history is supported on the one hand by such erudite  research as that of Fauchet and Pasquier; on the other hand it is  supported by political philosophy and speculation. To philosophy,  in the wider sense of the word, the sixteenth century made no large  and coherent contribution; the Platonism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism,  Stoicism of the Renaissance met and clashed together; the rival  theologies of the Roman and Reformed Churches contended in a struggle  for life. PIERRE DE LA RAMEE (1515-72) expressed the revolt of  rationalism against the methods of the schoolmen and the authority  of Aristotle; but he ordinarily wrote in Latin, and his _Dialectique_,  the first philosophical work in the vulgar tongue, hardly falls within  the province of literary history.    The philosophy of politics is represented by one great name, that  of JEAN BODIN (1529-96), whose _Republique_ may entitle him to be  styled the Montesquieu of the Renaissance. In an age which tended  towards the formation of great monarchies he was vigorously  monarchical. The patriarchal power of the sovereign might well be  thought needful, in the second half of the century, as a barrier  against anarchy; but Bodin was no advocate of tyranny; he condemned  slavery, and held that religious persecution can only lead to a  dissolution of religious belief. A citizen is defined by Bodin as  a free man under the supreme government of another; like Montesquieu,  he devotes attention to the adaptation of government to the varieties  of race and climate. The attempts at a general history of France in  the earlier part of the sixteenth century preserved the arid methods  and unilluminated style of the mediaeval chronicles;[3] in the second  half of the century they imitated with little skill the models of  antiquity. Histories of contemporary events in Europe were written  with conscientious impartiality by Lancelot de la Popeliniere, and  with personal and party passion, struggling against his well-meant  resolves, by Agrippa d'Aubigne. The great _Historia mei Temporis_  of De Thou, faithful and austere in its record of fact, was a  highly-important contribution to literature, but it is written in  Latin.    [Footnote 3: The narrative of the life of Bayard, by his secretary,  writing under the name of \"Le Loyal Serviteur\" (1527), is admirable  for its clearness, grace, and simplicity.]    With a peculiar gift for narrative, the French have been long  pre-eminent as writers of memoirs, and already in the sixteenth  century such personal recitals are numerous. The wars of Francois  I. and of Henri II. gave abundant scope for the display of individual  enterprise and energy; the civil wars breathed into the deeds of men  an intensity of passion; the actors had much to tell, and a motive  for telling it each in his own interest.    The _Commentaires_ of BLAISE DE MONLUC (1502-77) are said to have  been named by Henri IV. \"the soldier's Bible\"; the Bible is one which  does not always inculcate mercy or peace. Monluc, a Gascon of  honourable birth and a soldier of fortune, had the instinct of battle  in his blood; from a"]]]
