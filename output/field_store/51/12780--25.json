[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#19)"],[1,", thickly carpeted and having its  walls covered with a kind of matting kept in place by strips of bamboo.  Its roof was similarly concealed. A door near to the end, and on the  right, proved to open into a square room quite simply furnished in the  manner of a bed-sitting room. A little bathroom opened out of it in one  corner. The walls were distempered white, and there was no window.  Light was furnished by an electric lamp, hanging from the center of the  ceiling.    Soames, glancing at his bag, which Said had just placed beside the  white-enameled bedstead, turned to his impassive guide.    \"This is a funny go!\" he began, with forced geniality. \"Am I to live  here?\"    \"Ma'lesh!\" muttered Said--\"ma'lesh!\"    He indicated, by gestures, that Soames should remove his collar; he was  markedly unemotional. He crossed to the bathroom, and could be heard  filling the hand-basin with water.    \"Kursi!\" he called from within.    Soames, seriously doubting his own sanity, and so obsessed with a sense  of the unreal that his senses were benumbed, began to take off his  collar; he could not feel the contact of his fingers with his neck in  the act. Collarless, he entered the little bathroom....    \"Kursi!\" repeated Said; then: \"Ah! ana nesit! ma'lesh!\"    Said--whilst Soames, docile in his stupor, watched him--went back,  picked up the solitary cane chair which the apartment boasted, and  brought it into the bathroom. Soames perceived that he was to be treated  to something in the nature of a shampoo; for Said had ranged a number  of bottles, a cake of soap, and several towels, along a shelf over the  bath.    In a curious state of passivity, Soames submitted to the operation. His  hair was vigorously toweled, then fanned in the most approved fashion;  but this was no more than the beginning of the operation. As he leaned  back in the chair:    \"Am I dreaming?\" he said aloud. \"What's all this about?\"    \"Uskut!\" muttered Said--\"Uskut!\"    Soames, at no time an aggressive character, resigned himself to the  incredible.    Some lotion, which tingled slightly upon the scalp, was next applied  by Said from a long-necked bottle. Then, fresh water having been poured  into the basin, a dark purple liquid was added, and Soames' head dipped  therein by the operating Eastern. This time no rubbing followed, but  after some minutes of vigorous fanning, he was thrust back into  the chair, and a dry towel tucked firmly into his collar-band. He  anticipated that he was about to be shaved, and in this was not  disappointed.    Said, filling a shaving-mug from the hot-water tap, lathered Soames'  chin and the abbreviated whiskers upon which he had prided himself. Then  the razor was skilfully handled, and Soames' face shaved until his chin  was as smooth as satin.    Next, a dark brown solution was rubbed over the skin, and even upon  his forehead and right into the roots of the hair; upon his throat, his  ears, and the back of his neck. He was now past the putting of questions  or the raising of protest; he was as clay in the hands of the silent  Oriental. Having fanned his wet face again for some time, Said, breaking  the long silence, muttered:    \"Ikfil'iyyun!\"    Soames stared. Said indicated, by pantomime, that he desired him to  close his eyes, and Soames obeyed mechanically. Thereupon the Oriental  busied himself with the ex-butler's not very abundant lashes for five  minutes or more. Then the busy fingers were at work with his inadequate  eyebrows: finally:--    \"Khalas!\" muttered Said, tapping him on the shoulder.    Soames wearily opened his eyes, wondering if his strange martyrdom were  nearly at its end. He discovered his hair to be still rather damp, but,  since it was sparse, it was rapidly drying. His eyes smarted painfully.    Removing all trace of his operations, Said, with no word of farewell,  took up his towels, bottles and other paraphernalia and departed.    Soames watched the retreating figure crossing the outer room, but did  not rise from the chair until the door had closed behind Said. Then,  feeling strangely like a man who has drunk too heavily, he stood up  and walked into the bedroom. There was a small shaving-glass upon the  chest-of-drawers, and to this he advanced, filled with the wildest  apprehensions.    One glance he ventured, and started back with a groan.    His apprehensions had fallen short of the reality. With one hand  clutching the bedrail, he stood there swaying from side to side, and  striving to screw up his courage to the point whereat he might venture  upon a second glance in the mirror. At last he succeeded, looking long  and pitifully.    \"Oh, Lord!\" he groaned, \"what a guy!\"    Beyond doubt he was strangely changed. By nature, Luke Soames had hair  of a sandy color; now it was of so dark a brown as to seem black in the  lamplight. His thin eyebrows and scanty lashes were naturally almost  colorless; but they were become those of a pronounced brunette. He was  of pale complexion, but to-night had the face of a mulatto, or of one  long in tropical regions. In short, he was another man--a man whom he  detested at first sight!    This was the price, or perhaps only part of the price, of his  indiscretion. Mr. Soames was become Mr. Lucas. Clutching the top of  the chest-of-drawers with both hands, he glared at his own reflection,  dazedly.    In that pose, he was interrupted. Said, silently opening the door behind  him, muttered:    \"Ta'ala wayyaya!\"    Soames whirled around in a sudden panic, his heart leaping madly. The  immobile brown face peered in at the door.    \"Ta'ala wayyaya!\" repeated Said, his face expressionless as a mask. He  pointed along the corridor. \"Ho-Pin Effendi!\" he explained.    Soames, raising his hands to his collarless neck, made a swallowing  noise, and would have spoken; but:    \"Ta'ala wayyaya!\" reiterated the Oriental.    Soames hesitated no more. Reentering the corridor, with its  straw-matting walls, he made a curious discovery. Away to the left it  terminated in a blank, matting-covered wall. There was no indication of  the door by which he had entered it. Glancing hurriedly to the right,  he failed also to perceive any door there. The bespectacled Ho-Pin  stood halfway along the passage, awaiting him. Following Said in that  direction, Soames was greeted with the announcement:    \"Mr. King will see you.\"    The words taught Soames that his capacity for emotion was by no means  exhausted. His endless conjectures respecting the mysterious Mr. King  were at last to be replaced by facts; he was to see him, to speak with  him. He knew now that it was a fearful privilege which gladly he would  have denied himself.    Ho-Pin opened a door almost immediately behind him, a door the existence  of which had not hitherto been evident to Soames. Beyond, was a dark  passage.    \"You will follow me, closely,\" said Ho-Pin with one of his piercing  glances.    Soames, finding his legs none too steady, entered the passage behind  Ho-Pin. As he did so, the door was closed by Said, and he found himself  in absolute darkness.    \"Keep close behind me,\" directed the metallic voice.    Soames could not see the speaker, since no ray of light penetrated  into the passage. He stretched out a groping hand, and, although he was  conscious of an odd revulsion, touched the shoulder of the man in front  of him and maintained that unpleasant contact whilst they walked on and  on through apparently endless passages, extensive as a catacomb. Many  corners they turned; they turned to the right, they turned to the left.  Soames was hopelessly bewildered. Then, suddenly, Ho-Pin stopped.    \"Stand still,\" he said.    Soames became vaguely aware that a door was being closed somewhere near  to him. A lamp lighted up directly over his head... he found himself in  a small library!    Its four walls were covered with book-shelves from floor to ceiling, and  the shelves were packed to overflowing with books in most unusual and  bizarre bindings. A red carpet was on the floor and a red-shaded lamp  hung from the ceiling, which was conventionally white-washed. Although  there was no fireplace, the room was immoderately hot, and heavy with  the perfume of roses. On three little tables were great bowls filled  with roses, and there were other bowls containing roses in gaps between  the books on the open shelves.    A tall screen of beautifully carved sandalwood masked one corner of  the room, but beyond it protruded the end of a heavy writing-table upon  which lay some loose papers, and, standing amid them, an enormous silver  rose-bowl, brimming with sulphur-colored blooms.    Soames, obeying a primary instinct, turned, as the light leaped into  being, to seek the door by which he had entered. As he did so, the  former doubts of his own sanity returned with renewed vigor.    The book-lined wall behind him was unbroken by any opening.    Slowly, as a man awaking from a stupor, Soames gazed around the library.    It contained no door.    He rested his hand upon one of the shelves and closed his eyes. Beyond  doubt he was going mad! The tragic events of that night had proved too  much for him; he had never disguised from himself the fact that his  mental capacity was not of the greatest. He was assured, now, that  his brain had lost its balance shortly after his flight from Palace  Mansions, and that the events of the past two hours had been phantasmal.  He would presently return to sanity (or, blasphemously, he dared to  petition heaven that he would) and find himself...? Perhaps in the hands  of the police!    \"Oh, God!\" he groaned--\"Oh, God!\"    He opened his eyes...    A woman stood before the sandalwood screen! She had the pallidly dusky  skin of a Eurasian, but, by virtue of nature or artifice, her cheeks  wore a peachlike bloom. Her features were flawless in their chiseling,  save for the slightly distended nostrils, and her black eyes were  magnificent.    She was divinely petite, slender and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#19)"],[1,", but only  that melodies instead of being restricted between the tonic and its  octave, were permitted to pass below and above the tonic, coming back  to that as a center; for we must remember that in the ancient music  the tonality was purely arbitrary, and, so to say, accidental. While  all kinds of keys used the series of tones known by the names do, re,  mi, fa, so, la, si, do, it was within the choice of the composer to  bring his melodies to a close upon any one of these tones, which,  being thus emphasized, was regarded as the tonic of the melody.  Whatever of color one key had differing from another was due therefore  to the preponderance of some one tone of the scale in the course of  the melody. The Plain Song of the Roman Church, and of the English  Church as well, has been called Gregorian, from St. Gregory, and the  majority of ecclesiastical amateurs suppose that the square note  notation upon four lines was invented by St. Gregory. This, however,  is not the case. The melody, very likely, may have come down to us  with few alterations. The notation, however, has undergone several  very important changes, of which there will be more particular mention  in chapter XV. The Gregorian notation of the sixth century was  probably the Roman letters which we find in Hucbald, as will be seen  farther on. Several of the tunes well known to Protestants have been  arranged from the so-called Gregorian chants. They are \"Boylston,\"  \"Olmutz\" and \"Hamburg.\" The eighth tone, from which \"Olmutz\" was  arranged, has always been appropriated to the _Magnificat_ (\"My Soul  doth Magnify the Lord\").    The following are the ecclesiastical scales and names, as established  by St. Gregory:    [Music illustration:    _Dorian._    _Hypo-Dorian._    _Phrygian._    _Hypo-Phrygian._    _Lydian._    _Hypo-Lydian._    _Mixo-Lydian._    _Hypo-Mixo-Lydian._]    With the labors of St. Gregory the influence of the Church upon the  course of musical development by no means ceased. At various epochs in  its history synods, councils and popes have effected various reforms,  every reform consisting in barring out a certain amount of novelty  which had crept in, and in a supposed \"restoration\" of the service to  its pristine purity. The restoration, however, has never been  complete. Church music, like every other department of the art, has  gone on in increasing complexity from the beginning until now. The  main difference between the Church and the world in any century  consists in drawing the line of the permissible at a different point.  One of the latest reforms was that begun by Pope Marcellus and the  Council of Trent, which ordered from Palestrina an example of church  music as it should be.    Incidentally, in another direction, the Church has been of very great  influence upon the course of musical development. The great cathedrals  of the commercial centers of the world, in the effort to render their  service worthy of the congregation, have afforded support to talented  composers in all ages, and some of the most important movements in  music have been made by ecclesiastics or officials deriving support  from these sources. More extended particulars of this part of her  influence will be given later. It may suffice to mention the  cathedrals of Westminster and St. Paul in England, of Notre Dame in  Paris, to which we owe the old French school and the beginning of  polyphony; the cathedral at Strassburg, which supported important  musicians; Cologne, where the celebrated Franco lived; St. Mark's, at  Venice, where, from about 1350 to the end of the last century, an  extremely brilliant succession of musical directors found a field for  their activity.          CHAPTER XI.    THE DIDACTIC OF MUSIC FROM THE FIFTH CENTURY TO THE FOURTEENTH.      I.    There is very little in the Roman writers upon music that is of  interest. Macrobus, an expert grammarian and encyclopedist living at  Rome at the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century, wrote  a commentary upon the song of Scipio, in which he quotes from  Pythagoras concerning the music of the spheres: \"What hear I? What is  it which fills my ears with sounds so sweet and powerful? It is the  harmony which, formed of unequal intervals, but according to just  proportion, results from the impulse and movements of the spheres  themselves, and of which the sharp sound tempered by the grave sound  produces continually varied concerts.\" (Cicero, \"_De Republica_,\" VI.)  Commenting upon this passage, Macrobus says that Pythagoras was the  first of the Greeks who divined that the planets and the sidereal  universe must have harmonic properties such as Scipio spoke of, on  account of their regular movements and proportions to each other. We  find in the writings of Macrobus an advance upon the musical theories  of Ptolemy. He shows that contrary to the doctrine of Aristoxenus  there is not a true half tone, and that the relation 8:9 does not  admit of being equally divided. In place of the three symphonies of  the octave, fourth and fifth, mentioned by his predecessors, he makes  five, including the octave and the double octave. \"Such,\" he says, \"is  the number of symphonies that we ought to be astonished that the human  ear can comprehend them.\"    Another of the Roman writers upon music was Martinus Capella. His work  is called the \"Nuptials of Philologus and Mercury\" (\"_De Nuptiis  Philologiae et Mercurii_\"). The little upon music which the book  contains was only an abridgment of the Greek treatise of Aristides  Quintilianus.    The most important of the earliest treatises upon music, and by far  the most famous, is that of Boethius, as it is also the most  systematic. The following summary is from Fetis' \"History of Music,\"  Vol. IV:    \"Born at Rome between 470 and 475, Boethius made at home classical  studies, and went, they say, to Athens itself, where he studied  philosophy with Proclus. He was of the age of about thirty-five when,  in 510, he was made president of the senate. Theodoric, king of the  Ostrogoths, called him to himself, on account of his reputation for  wisdom and virtue; he confided to him an important position in the  palace, and intrusted to him many important diplomatic negotiations.  Boethius did nothing which was not to his credit, but this made him  only the more hostile to the interests of the courtiers; he was  therefore overthrown and cast into prison, where he composed his  'Consolations of Philosophy.' He was put to death 524 or 526.\"    Boethius' treatise on music is divided into five books. It is a vast  repertory of the knowledge of the ancients relative to this art. Its  doctrine is Pythagorean. The first book is divided into thirty-four  chapters. In the first he develops the thought of Aristotle, that  music is inherent in human nature. He there renders the text of a  decree which the Ephori of Sparta rendered against Timotheus of  Miletus, but which better critics have regarded as fictitious. The  second chapter establishes that there are three sorts of music: the  worldly, which is universal harmony; the human, which has its source  in the intelligence, which reunites and co-ordinates the elements;  finally, the third kind is artificial, made by instruments of  different sorts. The chapters following treat of the voice as the  source of music; of consonances and their proportions; of the division  of the voice and its compass; of the perception of sounds by the ear;  of the correspondence of the semitones; of the division of the octave;  of tetrachords; of the three genera--enharmonic, chromatic and  diatonic; of intervals of sounds compared to those of the stars; of  the musical and different faculties.    All the second book, divided into thirty chapters, is speculative, and  devotes itself to the different kinds and relations of intervals,  according to the different systems of theoreticians. The third book,  in seven chapters, is a continuation of the subject of the second. It  is particularly employed in refuting the errors of Aristoxenus. The  fourth book, in eighteen chapters, is entirely relative to the  practice of the art, particularly to the notation. It is in this book  that Boethius makes known the Latin notation of the first fifteen  letters of the alphabet without preparation, without the slightest  explanation, and as if he had done something which any one concerned  with music at Rome would readily understand, as a matter of course.  There is not one word to show that it was new, or that he claimed the  invention. It was undoubtedly the usual notation.    The fifth book of this treatise has for its object the determination  of intervals by the divisions of a monochord, and a refutation of the  systems of Ptolemy and Archytas. We here find this proposition,  remarkable if we recall the time when the author lived, that: \"If the  ear did not count the vibrations, and did not seize the inequalities  of movement of two sounds resonating by percussion, the intelligence  would not be able to render account of them by the science of  numbers.\" After Boethius there is nothing in Roman literature  concerning music. Notwithstanding that Italy fell under the dominion  of the Goths and Lombards after 476, it preserved Greek traditions in  music to the end of the sixth century.    Cassiodorus, who lived still in 562, aged almost 100 years, left a  souvenir for music in the fifth chapter of his treatise on the  \"Discipline of Letters and Liberal Arts\" (_De Artibus ac Disciplinis  Litterarum_). He enumerates the fifteen modes of Alypius as not having  been abandoned, and establishes them in their natural order, calling  them tones. Here also we find the classification of six kinds of  symphonies, about 300 years after this enumeration, first realized in  notes by Hucbald. He gives a series of fourths and of fifths,  occasionally for two voices, occasionally with the octave added. These  are the most important of all the things"]]]
