[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#19)"],[1,"eed, in his private Diary,  under that self-delusion which often led him to be blind to the import  of his language, contradicting, in one part, what he had said in another  part of the same sentence, evidently, as I believe, without any  conscious and intentional violation of truth, he makes this statement:  \"For my own part, I was always afraid of proceeding to convict and  condemn any person, as a confederate with afflicting Demons, upon so  feeble an evidence as a spectral representation. Accordingly, I ever  protested against it, both publicly and privately; and, in my letter to  the Judges, I particularly besought them that they would, by no means,  admit it; and when a considerable assembly of Ministers gave in their  advice about that matter, I not only concurred with them, but it was I  who drew it up.\"    This shows how he indulged himself in forms of expression that misled  him. His letter to \"the Judges\" means, I suppose, that written to  Richards; and he had so accustomed his mind to the attempt to make the  _Advice_ of the Ministers bear this construction, as to deceive  himself. That document does not say a word, much less, protest, against  the \"admission\" of that evidence: it was not designed, and was not  understood by any, at the time, to have that bearing, but only to urge  suggestions of caution, in its use and management. Charity to him  requires us to receive his declaration in the Diary as subject to the  modifications he himself connects with it, and to mean no more than we  find expressed in the letter to Richards and in the _Advice_. But, if he  really had deluded himself into the idea that he had protested against  the _admission_ of spectral evidence, he has not succeeded, probably, in  deluding any other persons than his son Samuel, who repeated the  language of the Diary, and our Reviewer.    The question, I finally repeat, is as to the admission of that species  of evidence, _at all_, in any stage, in any form, to any extent. Cotton  Mather never, in any public writing, \"denounced the admission\" of it,  never advised its absolute exclusion; but, on the contrary recognised it  as a ground of \"presumption.\" Increase Mather stated that the \"Devil's  accusations,\" which he considered spectral evidence really to be, \"may  be so far regarded as to cause an enquiry into the truth of things.\"  These are the facts of history, and not to be moved from their  foundation in the public record of that day. There is no reason to doubt  that all the Ministers, in the early stages of the delusion, concurred  in these views. All partook of the \"awe,\" mentioned by Mather, which  filled the minds of Juries, Judges, and the people, whenever this kind  of testimony was introduced. No matter how nor when, whether as  \"presumption\" to build other evidence upon or as a cause for further  \"enquiry,\" nothing could stand against it. Character, reason, common  sense, were swept away. So long as it was suffered to come in, any how,  or to be credited at all, the horrid fanaticism and its horrible  consequences continued. When it was wholly excluded, the reign of terror  and of death ceased.          IX.    COTTON MATHER AND THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS. JOHN PROCTOR. GEORGE  BURROUGHS.      The spectral evidence was admitted; and the examinations and trials went  on. The question now arises, what was Cotton Mather's attitude towards  them? The scrutiny as to the meaning of his words is exhausted; and now  we are to interpret his actions. They speak louder and clearer than  words. Let us, in the first place, make the proper distinction between  the Examinations, on the arrest of the prisoners and leading to their  commitment, and the Trials. The first Warrants were issued on the  twenty-ninth of February, 1692; and the parties arrested were brought  before the Magistrates the next day. Arrests and Examinations occurred,  at short intervals, during three months, when the first trial was had;  and they were continued, from time to time, long after, while the  Special Court was in operation. They were, in some respects, more  important than the Trials. Almost all the evidence, finally adduced  before the Jury, was taken by the examining Magistrates; and being  mostly in the form of carefully written depositions, it was simply  reproduced, and sworn to, before the Court. Further, as no Counsel was  allowed the Prisoners, the Trials were quite summary affairs. Hutchinson  says, no difficulty was experienced; and the results were quickly  reached, in every case but that of Rebecca Nurse.    These two stages in the proceedings became confounded in the public  apprehension, and have been borne down by tradition, indiscriminately,  under the name of Trials. It was the succession, at brief intervals,  through a long period, of these Examinations, that wrought the great  excitement through the country, which met Phips on his arrival; and  which is so graphically described by Cotton Mather, as a \"dreadful  ferment.\" He says he was not present at any of the Trials. Was he  present at any of the Examinations? The considerations that belong to  the solution of this question are the following:    When the special interest he must have taken in them is brought to mind,  from the turn of his prevalent thoughts and speculations, exhibited in  all his writings, and from the propensity he ever manifested to put  himself in a position to observe and study such things, it may be  supposed he would not have foregone opportunities like those presented  in the scenes before the Magistrates. While all other people, Ministers  especially, were flocking to them, it is difficult to conclude that he  held back. That he attended some of them is, perhaps, to be inferred  from the distinctive character of his language that he never attended a  _Trial_. The description given, in his _Life of Phips_, of what was  exhibited and declared by the \"afflicted children,\" at the Examinations,  exhibits a minuteness and vividness, seeming to have come from an  eye-witness; but there is not a particular word or syllable, I think, in  the account, from which an inference, either way, can be drawn whether,  or not, he was present at them, personally. This is observable, I  repeat, inasmuch as he was careful to say that he was _not_ present at  the _Trials_.    The Examinations, being of a character to arrest universal attention,  and from the extraordinary nature of their incidents, as viewed by that  generation, having attractions, all but irresistible, it is not  surprising that, as incidentally appears, Magistrates and Ministers came  to them, from all quarters. No local occurrences, in the history of  this country, ever awakened such a deep, awe-inspiring, and amazed  interest. It can hardly be doubted that he was attracted to them. Can  any other inference be drawn from the passage already quoted, from his  Diary, that he felt called, \"as a herald of the Lord's Kingdom, now  approaching,\" to give personal attendance, in \"the horrible enchantments  and possessions broke forth at Salem Village?\" There was a large  concourse of Magistrates and Ministers, particularly, on the  twenty-fourth of March, when Deodat Lawson preached his famous Sermon,  after the Examination of Rebecca Nurse; on the eleventh of April, when  the Governor and Council themselves conducted the Examination of John  Proctor and others; and, on the ninth of May, when Stoughton, from  Dorchester, and Sewall, from Boston, sat with the local Magistrates, and  the Rev. George Burroughs was brought before them. It is strange,  indeed, if Mather was not present, especially on the last occasion; and  it may appear, as we advance, that it is almost due to his reputation to  suppose that he was there, and thus became qualified and authorized to  pass the judgment he afterwards did.    Local tradition, of less value, in some respects, for reasons given in  my book, in reference to this affair than most others, but still of much  weight, has identified Cotton Mather with these scenes. The family, of  which John Proctor was the head, has continued to this day in the  occupancy of his lands. Always respectable in their social position,  they have perpetuated his marked traits of intellect and character. They  have been strong men, as the phrase is, in their day, of each  generation; and have constantly cherished in honor the memory of their  noble progenitor, who bravely breasted, in defence of his wife, the  fierce fanaticism of his age, and fell a victim to its fury and his own  manly fidelity and integrity. They have preserved, as much as any  family, a knowledge of the great tragedy; and it has been a tradition  among them that Cotton Mather took an active part in the prosecution of  Proctor. The representative of the family, in our day, a man of vigorous  faculties, of liberal education, academical and legal, and much  interested in antiquarian and genealogical enquiries, John W. Proctor,  presided at the Centennial Celebration, in Danvers, on the fifteenth of  June, 1852; and in his Address, expressed, no doubt, a transmitted  sentiment--although, as has generally been done, confounding the  Examinations with the Trials--in stating that Cotton Mather rendered  himself conspicuous in the proceedings against his ancestor.    Cotton Mather was the leading champion of the Judges. In his Diary, he  says: \"I saw, in most of the Judges, a most charming instance of  prudence and patience; and I know the exemplary prayer and anguish of  soul, wherewith they had sought the direction of heaven, above most  other people; whom I generally saw enchanted into a raging, railing,  scandalous and unreasonable disposition, as the distress increased upon  us. For this cause, _though I could not allow the principles that some  of the Judges had espoused_, yet I could not but speak honorably of  their persons, on all occasions; and my compassion upon the sight of  their difficulties, raised by _my journeys to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#19)"],[1,"ial_.    The only other occasion on which I have known a Moor to be hoisted with  the petard of his own contemptuous fanaticism was an experience of my  own.    I was moving quietly through a belt of timber just before dawn in the  hopes of getting a shot at a boar who was in the habit of feeding till  daybreak among some barley that grew near a caravan route. Before the  light was quite strong enough to shoot by I was more than a little  annoyed and astonished to hear cocks crowing all over the place;  presuming an early caravan with poultry for market, I pushed on to the  track, meaning to pass the time of day and ask if they had glimpsed my  quarry or heard him. I almost ran into a town-bred Moor who was trying  to round up some scattered poultry in the gloom and cursing volubly. He  explained that he was riding his donkey along the track perched between  two light reed cages containing fowls when the donkey baulked as a boar  snorted in the thickets just off the road. He whacked the donkey and  cursed the boar as a pig and a Christian. Thereupon came a rush like  cavalry, the donkey was knocked from under him and he was lying amid  the wreckage of his flimsy crates with his poultry scattered abroad. The  boar, already angry and suspicious, as anyone but a townsman would have  known by the noise he made, had charged like a thunderbolt at the sound  of a human voice so close to him and galloped off with all the honours  of war.    The donkey was badly hurt and the man only escaped because he was  sitting high and just above the point of impact. I helped him secure his  poultry and started back to my village to send him another donkey. He  thanked me in brotherly style as one Moor to another. \"I'm a Christian  myself,\" I remarked at parting, and added in my best beginner's Arabic  as I turned to go, \"It is incumbent on me to assist you after the  aggression of my co-religionist.\"    This conventional attitude of arrogance toward Christendom is perhaps  traceable to Moorish predominance in the Middle Ages and the importation  of Christian slaves by the pirates of the Barbary coast. In any case, it  has been much toned down of late years owing to contact with capable and  well-intentioned Franks as administrators and technical experts.    Morocco should never become a forcing-bed of religious or racial  antipathy, and will not so long as France continues to develop the  country by methods which the natives can assimilate, and is not lured  into over-exploitation of her mineral resources or unwarrantable  interference with her spiritual affairs.    A perfectly justifiable missionary policy would be the inauguration of  industrial schools on the coast and at one or two big inland centres,  also medical missions (with consent of the local authorities) wherever  feasible. Moorish craftsmanship is worth stimulating, and doctors are  welcomed for their science. Both schemes would redound to the credit of  Christendom and be in accordance with the best traditions of the Early  Church.    In the other Barbary states (Algeria, Tunis and Tripoli) a few Catholic  missions have been established, and the North African Protestant Mission  has an advanced post at Kairwan in Tunis. Here many routes converge, for  Kairwan is a great centre of pilgrimage and taps the religious thought  of all the Saharan tribes. Under such conditions, Islam gets ahead every  time, as every caravan traveller is a potential missionary, while  Christian missions are anchored to the spot or have to rely on native  colporteurs, who labour under the initial disadvantage of being  proselytes and seldom have the combination of tact and staunchness which  evangelists require.    It is in Egypt that we first find Moslem and missionary at close grips  arrayed against each other. Cairo is a perfect cockpit of creeds.  Christianity is represented by Catholics, Copts, Orthodox Greeks and  Protestants, these last being subdivided into Anglicans, Presbyterians,  Wesleyans and American Presbyterians and Congregationalists. The main  body of Islam--some of my more fervent missionary friends allude to it  as \"the hosts of Midian\"--presents a fairly solid front of orthodoxy,  the bulk being Hanifis, Shafeis, Maliki or Hanbalis (chiefly the two  former); but the irregular forces of Shiah are well represented among  non-indigenous Moslems from Yamen, Persia and India, while scattered  groups of Wahabi ascetics, Sufi mystics and esoterics of Bahaism  skirmish on debatable ground between the opposing lines, where range  such free-lance companies as Theosophists, Christian Scientists,  Salvationists, etc., all with local headquarters in Cairo and propaganda  of their own.    It must not be supposed that all this warlike metaphor indicates actual  strife or even severe friction, any more than \"the hosts of Midian\"  represents the attitude of missionaries to Moslems here. On the  contrary, relations are for the most part excellent, and the prevailing  animosity is political, not religious, being directed against us  British much as normal schoolboys dislike their form-master until they  get a harsher one.    The Catholic Church confines most of her energies to teaching her own  people, who are very numerous and well looked after; she does not do  much alien mission work in this part of the world. The most formidable  band of gladiators in the Christian ranks is the American Protestant  Mission, and next to them the Anglican C.M.S. (chiefly distinguished in  Egypt for its medical work, which is excellent and has an  extraordinarily wide range). The Americans are great on education and  have done more for the English language in Cairo than any Government  institution. I use the term \"gladiators\" advisedly, for their most  trenchant work is done on their own side--they concentrate their chief  efforts on the Copts, and make a fairly good bag of proselytes from  them, apart from the great number to whom they teach sound ideals of  duty as well as English and the three \"R's.\" One of their leading  missionaries has left it on record that no one stands more in need of  salvation than the Copts, and as there is a Coptic Reform Society the  Copts must think there is room for improvement too.    It has been found in practice that to convert a _bona-fide_ Moslem  involves segregating him, and that means finding him a living in a new  environment, otherwise he is almost bound to \"revert\" under local  pressure. Apart from the strain on mission resources which such  procedure would cause if extensively followed, most missionaries rightly  condemn such a system as encouraging conversion for material motives.  Therefore they adopt a policy of \"peaceful penetration\" against Islam,  encouraging young men to come to them unostentatiously (I call them the  Nicodemus-squad) in order to discuss religious questions, which is  usually done in a temperate and intelligent manner on both sides. Even  if they get no \"forrader,\" it tends to toleration and a better knowledge  of each other's language and ideals. A good deal of teaching is done too  with no expectation of making proselytes, and solid friendships are  formed. I have myself known a convalescing lady missionary of the C.M.S.  to receive repeated calls of friendly inquiry from former pupils; when I  first saw two veiled young girls swing past with a palpably British  terrier and the crisp, vigorous step of occidental emancipation, it  puzzled my ethnological faculties until I was told the object of their  visit.    All this is to the good, and it would be very good indeed if they let  well alone. Unfortunately, there is another cogent factor in the mission  field, and that is the sinews of war in hard cash. Most people, even  those who support missions to Moslem countries, are human enough to like  a fight put up for their money. It is not enough for them that a great  deal of quiet, patient work is being done by missionaries among Moslems  in the name of Christianity and the service of mankind. They want to  hear about storming citadels of sin and campaigning against the devil in  the dark places of the earth; especially is this so in America, where  Moslem prejudice does not have to be considered and religious  organisation, like most other concerns, is on a big scale.    As a natural consequence, missionaries have to play up to this combatant  instinct, and so we read in their books and reports remarks calculated  to engender religious intolerance on both sides, and which do not  conform with the shrewd and kindly work in the field of those devoted  and often scholarly men. I shall have occasion to allude to some of  these statements as we proceed, so think it only fair to mention their  justification here.    Cairo is described as a \"strategic centre\" in mission parlance, and so  it is, being situated on a great waterway with rail connection far  south into the heart of Africa and converging caravan routes from every  quarter. Along these arteries of traffic many tons of tracts and  propaganda are hurled annually by train, felucca and colporteur. Those  who cannot read accept such matter gladly to wrap things up in and to  show to their literate friends, who read what resembles a bit of the  Koran and find it carries a sting in its tail, like a scorpion, aimed at  Islam. A great deal of this literature consists of the Psalms of David,  the Talmud or the Gospel, all reverenced by Moslems if dished up without  trimmings. Not wishing to impose on that hard-worked word \"camouflage,\"  I would merely ask, as a naturalist, if such protective mimicry is worth  the irritation it causes. In any case, the system reminds me of an old  Highlander's opening comment on a sword dance by a rock scorpion in a  Tangier saloon. \"There is a sairtain elegance aboot yourr grace-steps,  but _get in between the swords_.\"    No vicarious efforts by propaganda will ever take the place of personal  precept and example.
