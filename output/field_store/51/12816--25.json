[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#19)"],[1,"0,000 towards the  erection of Divinity Schools in connection with the University of  Cambridge, which have just been completed.]    Near this we may notice an ancient gravestone, or part of a monument  found under the floor of the nave in St. Mary's Church, in 1829. It  represents an angel with wings raised above the head, bearing a small  naked figure, probably representing the soul of a bishop, as a crozier  appears at the side; the angel has on a kind of cope with an  ornamental border; and around the head is a large circular aureole,  and the canopy shows a mass of buildings with semicircular arches.  There is an inscription on the rim, \"_St. Michael oret p' me_.\" To  whose memory it was executed it is impossible to say, but it is  doubtless of great interest.    A good view of the organ may be had from this aisle by looking over  the tomb in the fourth bay from the chapel.    Several other monuments to former prelates of the church, and to other  persons, may be observed in this aisle: one to Bishop Gunning  (1675-1684), worthy of remembrance as the author of the \"Prayer for  all sorts and conditions of men.\" Near the foot of this monument is a  piscina in the wall. A little further we find one to Bishop Heton  (1600-1609), occupying the fifth bay, and is perhaps the only instance  since the Reformation, of the effigy of a bishop in a cope ornamented  with saints; the figures on the left border are those of St.  Bartholomew, St. Matthias, St. Andrew, St. Peter, and St. John.    Before passing on to the few remaining monuments we will notice the  only two specimens of ancient memorial brasses, of which there were  many in the Cathedral, as appears by the numerous incised stones in  different parts of the church, many of them were evidently of a rich  and elaborate character, but all, with the above exception, have  disappeared by the act of the mercenary or the fanatic. The first is a  memorial to Bishop Goodrich (1534-1554), a singular instance of a hot  reformer commemorated by a brass in which are pourtrayed all the  ecclesiastical vestments, he holds his crozier in his left hand, and  in his right he carries a Bible from which depends the great seal of  England, the bishop having been appointed Lord High Chancellor in  1551; the inscription has been removed. The other is in memory of  Humphrey Tyndall, fourth dean of the Cathedral (1591-1614), who is  represented in his robes, with a square-cut beard; an inscription is  engraved in the border, and the following lines beneath the feet of  the effigy:         \"THE BODY OF THE WOORTHY & REVERENDE PRELATE       VMPHRY TYNDALL, DOCTOR OF DIVINITY, THE FOVRTH DEAN       OF THIS CHVRCH, AND MASTER OF QVEENES COLLEDGE IN       CAMBRIDGE DOTH HERE EXPECT THE COMING OF OVR SAVIOVR.         \"In presence, gouerment, good actions and in birth,       Graue, wise, couragious, Noble was this earth,       The poor, the church, the colledge saye here lyes       'A friende, A Deane, A maister, true, good, wise.'\"    We have now an opportunity of noticing the piers which separate Bishop  Northwold's work from that of Bishop Hotham; \"they are,\" as Mr.  Millers observes, \"a combination of the two sorts of column severally  in use at the respective times at which the two fabrics were erected;  the east side has the small shafts distinct from the main column, and  the west side is clustered, and where they meet is a niche for a  statue.\"[49] In the niche on this side is a tablet to the memory of  the Rev. James Bentham, Canon of Ely, and author of \"The History and  Antiquities of Ely Cathedral,\" a work of acknowledged merit, the  result of many years' labour and research. He died in 1794, aged 86.    [Footnote 49: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 89.]    The monument to Robert Steward, Esq., who died A.D. 1570, is next in  our route, and beyond that one to Sir Mark Steward, who died A.D.  1603, both examples of no particular style. In the last bay is the  monument erected to the memory of Bishop Allen, whose gravestone we  noticed in passing the retro-choir; on the table of the monument is a  reclining figure of the prelate in his robes, in white marble,  considered to be a good likeness.    Back-screens to mask the stalls, similar to those in the north aisle,  have been erected on this side, against which have been placed the  monuments of Bishop Moore (1707-1714), Bishop Butts (1738-1748), and  Bishop Greene (1723-1738). On the pillar between the two last is a  tablet to the memory of William Lynne, gentleman, of Bassingbourne,  the first husband of Elizabeth, daughter of William Steward, of Ely,  and afterwards mother of Oliver Cromwell.    The new screens with gates at the western end of the aisles are worthy  of notice as specimens of modern work in wrought iron; they were  executed by Mr. Skidmore, of Coventry, from designs by Sir G.G. Scott.  That in the south aisle was given by G.A. Lowndes, Esq., of Barrington  Hall, Essex; and that in the north aisle by Dean Peacock.    Near the Library door is a simple memorial stone[50] to Dean Peacock,  the great promoter of the recent restorations, who died in 1858, and  was buried in the Cemetery. Just below this is an elegant memorial  brass to the Rev. Solomon Smith, M.A., for over forty years a Minor  Canon of the Cathedral, and for many years Incumbent of St. Mary's.    [Footnote 50: See note, p. 50.]    Several other memorial remains may be observed in various parts of the  church, but to enumerate them or to point them out would exceed our  limits, one we may notice in passing, that of Dean Caesar (1614-1636),  which has been removed from a position it long occupied in the north  aisle of the Choir, to the junction of that aisle with the closed end  of the eastern aisle of the north Transept, near the new pulpit.    We may also notice a new oaken lectern or reading desk near the  pulpit, containing a beautifully carved figure representative of the  first beatitude, under a cinquefoil canopy, the gift of the Very Rev.  the Dean.    \"Of fifty-four bishops of Ely,\" says Mr. Millers, \"thirty-five are  known to have been buried in this Cathedral, and two in the Lady  Chapel. Of these thirty-seven, there are memorials of twenty; some of  them very scanty and much mutilated, and many removed from the spots  where the bodies of those whom they commemorate repose. Of the other  seventeen, there were no doubt, similar memorials, but they 'are  perished as though they had never been.'\"[51] Since the above was  written two others have been buried in the Cathedral--Bishop Sparke  in West's chapel, and Bishop Allen behind the altar screen, as we have  noticed; Bishop Turton (1845-1864), was buried at Kensal Green.    [Footnote 51: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 85.]           *       *       *       *       *    +The Lady Chapel.+    We will now direct the attention of the visitor to this most  interesting building, which stands on the north side of the Cathedral,  parallel with the Choir, and is approached through a doorway at the  north-east corner of the north Transept. This chapel was erected in  the early part of the fourteenth century, the first stone being laid  on Lady-day, 1321, by Alan de Walsingham, then sub-prior, and the  whole was completed A.D. 1349. The works were carried on chiefly under  the charge of John de Wisbech, one of the monks, who, it is stated,  whilst assisting in digging the foundations, found a brazen pot of old  coins buried in the earth, and which proved a great assistance in  carrying on the work. This was, perhaps, one of the most beautiful and  elaborate specimens of the Decorated style in England; and as Mr.  Stewart observes, \"must have been a perfect storehouse of statuary and  elaborate tabernacle work.\" Even in its present dilapidated state it  will amply repay a careful examination. It was dedicated to St. Mary,  and after the Reformation, was (in 1566) assigned by the Dean and  Chapter for the use of the inhabitants of the parish of Holy Trinity  in lieu of their own church then in ruins, and has since been  frequently called \"Trinity Church.\"    This is, perhaps, the widest single-span church in the kingdom, being  46 feet in width; the length is 100 feet, and the height 60 feet to  the centre of the ceiling. Its length is divided into five severies,  in each of which, on both sides, is a window of great size with four  lights and rich tracery, in some of which are fragments of the  original stained glass, sufficient to indicate that they were all, at  one period, entirely so filled. The end windows are noble and  spacious, the west window having eight lights, and the east window  seven, both have transoms, and each with tracery differing from the  other, and from the windows in the sides. Both are insertions of a  somewhat later date than the building, the east window by Bishop  Barnet about 1373, and the other a little later.    The walls everywhere display a rich profusion and variety of ornament,  once beautified with colouring and gilding, but some years ago covered  with whitewash; a few faint traces of its former splendour may yet be  found in various parts of the chapel, enough perhaps to shew that it  must have been gorgeous in the extreme.    A low bench table runs along the walls and carries a series of niches  with canopies richly decorated, the piers of which rise from the  floor, but each is divided into two by a slender pillar rising from  the bench table; the arcade on the north side consists of nineteen  tabernacles separated by square pilasters of Purbeck marble; there are  five sets of three each under the windows, and the remaining four fill  up the intermediate spaces between the five groups. The canopy of each  of the fifteen tabernacles consists of a head of singular beauty,  radiated and inclined forwards, on the apex is, or was, the figure of  a saint; above these is a hood-mould crocketed, and terminating with a  finial.

The first remarkable case of sorcery in New England occurred  at Boston, in 1688. Four children of a pious family were affected in a  peculiar manner, imitating the cries of cats and dogs, and complaining  of pains all over their bodies. These were the regulation symptoms of  witch-possession, which presumably they had often heard discussed. An  old Irish serving-woman, indentured to the family, who already bore the  name of a witch, was charged with having bewitched them, and executed,  the four ministers of Boston having first held at the house a day of  prayer and fasting.    [Illustration: Cotton Mather.]    Young Cotton Mather, grandson of the distinguished Rev. John Cotton, a  man of vast erudition and fervent piety, was at this time colleague to  his father, Increase Mather, as pastor of the Boston North Church. His  imagination had been abnormally developed by fasts and vigils, in which  he believed himself to hold uncommonly close communication with the  Almighty. His desire to provide new arms for faith against the growing  unbelief of his time led him to take one of the \"bewitched\" children to  his house, that he might note and describe the ways of the devil in her  case. The results he soon after published in his \"Memorable Providences  Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions.\" This work admitted no doubt as  to the reality of the demoniac possessions, which indeed it affected to  demonstrate forever. All the Boston ministers signed its preface,  certifying to its \"clear information\" that \"both a God and a devil, and  witchcraft\" existed. \"Nothing too vile,\" it alleged, \"can be said of,  nothing too hard can be done to, such a horrible iniquity as witchcraft  is.\" The publication excited great attention, and to it in no small  measure the ensuing tragedy may be traced.    [Illustration: Old Tituba the Indian.]    In February, 1692, three more subjects, children of Rev. Mr. Parris,  minister at Danvers, then called Salem Village, exhibited bad witchcraft  symptoms. The utmost excitement prevailed. Neighboring clergymen joined  the village in fasting and prayer. A general fast for the colony was  ordered. But the \"devilism,\" as Cotton Mather named it, spread instead  of abating, the children having any number of imitators so soon as they  became objects of general notice and sympathy. Old Tituba, an Indian  crone, who had served in Parris's family, was the first to be denounced  as the cause. Two other aged females, one crazy, the other bed-ridden,  were also presently accused, and after a little while several ladies of  Parris's church. Whoso uttered a whisper of incredulity, general or as  to the blameworthiness of any whom Parris called guilty, was instantly  indicted with them.    On April 11th, the Deputy Governor held in the meeting-house in Salem  Village a court for a preliminary examination of the prisoners. A scene  at once ridiculous and tragic followed. When they were brought in, their  alleged victims appeared overcome at their gaze, pretending to be  bitten, pinched, scratched, choked, burned, or pricked by their  invisible agency in revenge for refusing to subscribe to a covenant with  the devil. Some were apparently stricken down by the glance of an eye  from one of the culprits, others fainted, many writhed as in a fit.  Tituba was beaten to make her confess. Others were tortured. Finally all  the accused were thrown into irons. Numbers of accused persons, assured  that it was their only chance for life, owned up to deeds of which they  must have been entirely innocent. They had met the devil in the form of  a small black man, had attended witch sacraments, where they renounced  their Christian vows, and had ridden through the air on broomsticks.  Such were the confessions of poor women who had never in their lives  done any evil except possibly to tattle.    [Illustration: Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton.]    On June 2d, a special court was held in Salem for the definite trial.  Stoughton, Lieutenant Governor, a man of small mind and bigoted temper,  was president. The business began by the condemnation and hanging of a  helpless woman. A jury of women had found on her person a wart, which  was pronounced to be unquestionably a \"devil's teat,\" and her neighbors  remembered that many hens had died, animals become lame, and carts upset  by her dreadful \"devilism.\" By September 23d, twenty persons had gone to  the gallows, eight more were under sentence, and fifty-five had  \"confessed\" and turned informers as their only hope. The \"afflicted\" had  increased to fifty. Jails were crammed with persons under accusation,  and fresh charges of alliance with devils were brought forward every  day.    [Illustration: Fac-simile of Sheriff's Return of an Execution.]    Some of the wretched victims displayed great fortitude. Goodman Procter  lost his life by nobly and persistently--vainly as well,  alas!--maintaining the innocence of his accused wife. George Burroughs,  who had formerly preached in Salem Village, was indicted. His physical  strength, which happened to be phenomenal, was adduced as lent him from  the devil. Stoughton browbeat him through his whole trial. What sealed  his condemnation, however, was his offer to the jury of a paper quoting  an author who denied the possibility of witchcraft. His fervent prayers  when on the scaffold, and especially his correct rendering of the Lord's  Prayer, shook the minds of many. They argued that no witch could have  gotten through those holy words correctly--a test upon which several had  been condemned. Cotton Mather, present at the gallows, restored the  crowd to faith by reminding them that the devil had the power to dress  up like an angel of light. Rebecca Nurse, a woman of unimpeachable  character hitherto, unable from partial deafness to understand, so as to  explain, the allegations made against her, was convicted notwithstanding  every proof in her favor.    Reaction now began. Public opinion commenced to waver. No one knew whose  turn to be hanged would come next. Emboldened by their fatal success,  accusers whispered of people in high places as leagued with the Evil  One. An Andover minister narrowly escaped death. The Beverly minister,  Hale, one of the most active in denouncing witches, was aghast when his  own wife was accused. Two sons of Governor Bradstreet were obliged to  flee for their lives, one for refusing, as a magistrate, to issue any  more warrants, the other charged with bewitching a dog. Several hurried  to New York to escape conviction. The property of such was seized by  their towns. A reign of terror prevailed.    People slowly awoke to the terrible travesty of justice which was going  on. Magistrates were seen to have overlooked the most flagrant instances  of falsehood and contradiction on the part of both accusers and accused,  using the baseless hypothesis that the devil had warped their senses.  The disgusting partiality shown in the accusations was disrelished, as  was the resort that had been had to torture. One poor old man of eighty  they crushed to death because he would plead guilty to nothing. The  authorities quite disregarded the fact that everyone of the  self-accusations had been made in order to escape punishment. These  considerations effected a revolution in the minds of most people.  Remonstrances were presented to the courts, securing reprieve for those  under sentence of death at Salem. This so irritated the despicable  Stoughton that he resigned.    The forwardness of the ministers therein turned many against the  persecution, After the first victims had fallen at Salem, Governor Phips  took their advice whether or not to proceed. Cotton Mather indited the  reply. It thankfully acknowledges \"the success which the merciful God  has given to the sedulous and assiduous endeavors of our honorable  rulers to defeat the abominable witch crafts which have been committed  in the country, humbly praying that the discovery of those mysterious  and mischievous wickednesses may be perfected. It is pleasant to note,  after all, the ministers' advice to the civil rulers not to rely too  much on \"the devil's authority\"--on the evidence, that is, of those  possessed. The court heeded this injunction all too little, but by and  by it had weight with the public, who judged that, as the trials  appeared to be proceeding on devil's evidence alone, the farce ought to  cease. The Superior Court met in Boston, April 25, 1693, and the grand  Jury declined to find any more bills against persons accused of sorcery.  King William vetoed the Witchcraft Act, and by the middle of 1693 all  the prisoners were discharged.        CHAPTER IV.    THE MIDDLE COLONIES    [1686]    The English conquest of New Netherland from the Dutch speedily followed  the Stuarts' return to the throne. Cromwell had mooted an attack on  Dutch America, and, as noticed in Chapter I., Connecticut's charter of  1662 extended that colony to include the Dutch lands. England based her  claim to the territory on alleged priority of discovery, but the real  motives were the value of the Hudson as an avenue for trade, and the  desire to range her colonies along the Atlantic coast in one unbroken  line. The victory was not bloody, nor was it offensive to the Dutch  themselves, who in the matter of liberties could not lose. King Charles  had granted the conquered tract to his brother, the Duke of York,  subsequently James II., and it was in his honor christened with its  present name of New York.    The Duke's government was not popular, especially as it ordered the  Dutch land-patents to be renewed--for money, of course; and in 1673,  war again existing between England and Holland, the Dutch recovered  their old possession. They held it however for only fifteen months,  since at the Peace of 1674 the two belligerent nations mutually restored  all the posts which they had "]]]
