The quality of the soil they yield is not however  entirely dependent on the nature of the particular felspar which yields  it, but is also intimately connected with the extent to which the  decomposition has advanced. It is observed that different felspars  undergo decomposition with different degrees of rapidity but after a  certain time they all begin to lose their peculiar lustre, acquire a  dull and earthy appearance, and at length fall into a more or less white  and soft powder. During this change water is absorbed, and, by the  decomposing action of the air, the alkaline silicate is gradually  rendered soluble, and at length entirely washed away, leaving a  substance which, when mixed with water, becomes plastic, and has all the  characters of common clay. The nature of this change will be best seen  by the following analysis of the clay produced during this composition,  which is employed in the manufacture of porcelain under the name of  kaolin, or china clay--         Silica             46.80       Alumina            36.83       Peroxide of iron    3.11       Carbonate of lime   0.55       Potash              0.27       Water              12.44                           ----                         100.00    In this instance the decomposition of the felspar had reached its limit,  a mere trace of potash being left, but if taken at different stages of  the process, variable proportions of that alkali are met with. This  decomposition of felspar is the source of the great deposits of clay  which are so abundantly distributed over the globe, and it takes place  with nearly equal rapidity with potash and soda felspar. It is rarely  complete, and the soils produced from it frequently contain a  considerable proportion of the undecomposed mineral, which continues for  a long period to yield a supply of alkalies to the plants which grow on  them.    Mica is a very widely distributed mineral, and two varieties of it are  distinguished by mineralogists, one of which is characterised by the  large quantity of magnesia it contains. Different specimens are found to  vary very greatly in composition, but the following analyses may  represent their most usual composition:                                     MICA.                             |----------------|                             Potash.

Its persistence is dependent on the  small quantity of alkaline constituents which it contains; and for this  reason it is observed that the magnesian micas undergo decomposition  less rapidly than those containing the larger quantity of potash.  Eventually, however, both varieties become converted into clay, their  magnesia and potash passing gradually into soluble forms.    Hornblende and augite are two widely distributed minerals, which are so  similar in composition and properties that they may be considered  together. Of the former two varieties, basaltic and common have been  distinguished, and their composition is given below:--                          Hornblende.                    |----------------|                    Common.

The minerals just referred to, constitute the great bulk of the mountain  masses, but they are associated with many others which take part in the  formation of the soil. Of these the most important are the zeolites  which do not occur in large masses but are disseminated through the  other rocks in small quantity. They form a large class of minerals of  which Thomsonite and natrolite may be selected as examples--            Thomsonite.  Natrolite.    Silica     38.73       48.68  Alumina    30.84       26.36  Lime       13.43         --  Potash      0.54        0.23  Soda        3.85       16.00  Water      13.09        9.55              ----        ----            100.48      100.83    They are chiefly characterized by containing their silica in a soluble  state, and hence may yield that substance to the plants in a condition  particularly favourable for absorption.    It is obvious from what has been stated that all these minerals are  capable, by their decomposition, of yielding soft porous masses having  the physical properties of soils, but most of them would be devoid of  many essential ingredients, while not one of them would yield either  phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, or chlorine. It has, however, been  recently ascertained that certain of these minerals, or at least the  rocks formed from them, contain minute, but distinctly appreciable  traces of phosphoric acid, although in too small quantity to be detected  by ordinary analysis; and small quantities of chlorine and sulphuric  acid may also in most instances be found.    Still it will be observed that most of these minerals would yield a soil  containing only two or three of those substances, which, as we have  already learned, are essential to the plant. Thus, potash felspar, while  it would give abundance of potash, would be but an inefficient source  of lime and magnesia; and labradorite, which contains abundance of lime,  is altogether deficient in magnesia and potash.    Nature has, however, provided against this difficulty, for she has so  arranged it that these minerals rarely occur alone, the rocks which form  our great mountain masses being composed of intimate mixtures of two or  more of them, and that in such a manner that the deficiencies of the one  compensate those of the other. We shall shortly mention the composition  of these rocks.    Granite is a mixture of quartz, felspar, and mica in variable  proportions, and the quality of the soil it yields depends on whether  the variety of felspar present be orthoclase or albite. When the former  is the constituent, granite yields soils of tolerable fertility,  provided their climatic conditions be favourable; but it frequently  occurs in high and exposed situations which are unfavourable to the  growth of plants. Gneiss is a similar mixture, but characterised by the  predominance of mica, and by its banded structure. Owing to the small  quantity of felspar which it contains, and the abundance of the  difficulty decomposable mica, the soils formed by its disintegration are  generally inferior. Mica slate is also a mixture of quartz, felspar, and  mica, but consisting almost entirely of the latter ingredient, and  consequently presenting an extreme infertility. The position of the  granite, gneiss, and mica slate soils in this country is such that very  few of them are of much value; but in warm climates they not  unfrequently produce abundant crops of grain. Syenite is a rock similar  in composition to granite, but having the mica replaced by hornblende,  which by its decomposition yields supplies of lime and magnesia more  readily than they can be obtained from the less easily disintegrated  mica. For this reason soils produced from the syenitic rocks are  frequently possessed of considerable fertility.    The series of rocks of which greenstone and trap are types, and which  are very widely distributed, differ greatly in composition from those  already mentioned. They are divisible into two great classes, which have  received the names of diorite and dolerite, the former a mixture of  albite and hornblende, the latter of augite and labradorite, sometimes  with considerable quantities of a sort of oligoclase containing both  soda and lime, and of different kinds of zeolitic minerals. Generally  speaking, the soils produced from diorite are superior to those from  dolerite. The albite which the former contains undergoes a rapid  decomposition, and yields abundance of soda along with some potash,  which is seldom altogether wanting, while the hornblende supplies both  lime and magnesia. Dolerite, when composed entirely of augite and  labradorite, produces rather inferior soils; but when it contains  oligoclase and zeolites, and comes under the head of basalt, its  disintegration is the source of soils remarkable for their fertility;  for these latter substances undergoing rapid decomposition furnish the  plants with abundant supplies of alkalies and lime, while the more  slowly decomposing hornblende affords the necessary quantity of  magnesia. In addition to these, the basaltic rocks are found to contain  appreciable quantities of phosphoric acid, so that they are in a  condition to yield to the plant almost all its necessary constituents.    The different rocks now mentioned, with a few others of less general  distribution, constitute the whole of our great mountain masses; and  while their general composition is such as has been stated, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#19)"],[1,"rifles, ammunition, and possibly recruits must  have reached them from some quarter, either from German Damaraland or  the Portuguese coast. At any rate there has been so much ammunition used  since, that either Reitz must have been raving or else large supplies  have reached the Boers from some unknown source.    So much for the official attempts at peace.    They have been given in some detail in order to prove how false it is  _that the British Government has insisted upon an unconditional  surrender_. Far from this being so, the terms offered by the British  Government have been so generous that they have aroused the strongest  distrust and criticism in this country, where they have seemed to be  surrendering by the pen all that had been won by the sword. Nothing has  been refused the enemy, save only independence, and that can never be  given, if the war has to continue until the last Boer is deported out of  Africa.    It is only necessary to refer briefly to the unofficial Boer attempts at  peace. A considerable body of the Boers, including many men of influence  and of intelligence, were disposed to accept the British flag and to  settle down in peace. The leaders of this party were the brave Piet de  Wet, brother of Christian, Paul Botha of Kroonstad, Fraser of  Bloemfontein, and others. Piet de Wet, who had fought against us as hard  as any man, wrote to his brother: 'Which is better, for the Republics to  continue the struggle and run the risk of total ruin as a nation, or to  submit? Could we for a moment think of taking back the country, if it  were offered to us, with thousands of people to be supported by a  Government which has not a farthing? Put passionate feeling aside for a  moment and use common-sense, and you will then agree with me that the  best thing for the people and the country is to give in, to be loyal to  the new Government, and to get responsible government.' Such were the  sentiments of many of the best of the burghers, and they endeavoured to  persuade their fellows. Both in the Transvaal and in the Free State,  Peace Committees were formed among the burghers, who sent deputies to  lay the facts of the situation before their brethren on commando. The  results were tragic. Two of the envoys, Morgendaal and de Koch, were  shot in cold blood, the former having been first beaten. Several of the  others were beaten, and all were ill-used.    This severity did not, however, stop the movement, but gave it a fiercer  turn. The burghers who were in favour of peace, finding it useless to  argue with their fellow-countrymen and knowing that their country was  being hopelessly ruined by the insensate resistance, took the extreme  course at last of bearing arms against them. There are at present three  strong commandos of burghers fighting upon the British side, commanded  by three Boer Generals--Marais, Celliers, and the younger Cronje, all of  whom had made their names in fighting against us. This fact alone goes  far to dispel those stories of British barbarity with which I shall  presently deal. They are believed in by political fanatics in England  and by dupes abroad, but the answer which many of the Boers upon the  spot make to them is to enlist and fight under the British flag. They  are in the best position for knowing the truth, and how can they show in  a stronger way what they believe that truth to be?          CHAPTER VI    THE FARM-BURNING      In the official correspondence which is published between the Boer and  British leaders in South Africa may very clearly be traced the way in  which this practice came to assume proportions which shocked public  opinion. It must be admitted that the results have not justified it, and  that, putting all moral questions apart, a burned-out family is the last  which is likely to settle down, as we hope that the Boers may eventually  settle down, as contented British citizens. On the other hand, when a  nation adopts guerilla tactics it deliberately courts those sufferings  to the whole country which such tactics invariably entail. They have  been the same in all wars and at all times. The army which is stung by  guerillas, strikes round it furiously and occasionally indiscriminately.  An army which is continually sniped and harassed becomes embittered, and  a General feels called upon to take those harsher measures which  precedent and experience suggest. That such measures have not been  pushed to an extreme by the British authorities is shown by the fact  that the captured guerilla has been made a prisoner of war--unlike his  prototype, the _franc-tireur_. The general question of guerillas may be  discussed later. At present we will confine our attention to the burning  of farms.    The first protest from the Boer side is dated February 3, 1900. In it  the two Presidents accuse the British troops 'of burning and blowing up  with dynamite the farmhouses, and of the devastation of farms.' The  document also includes an accusation of having used armed natives  against the Boers.    Lord Roberts replied upon February 5 to the effect that stringent  instructions had been given to the British troops to respect private  property. 'All wanton destruction or injury to peaceful inhabitants is  contrary to British practice and tradition, and will, if necessary, be  rigorously repressed by me.' He added that it was an untrue statement  that natives had ever been encouraged by British officers to commit  depredations. The charge, which has been the subject of many effective  cartoons upon the Continent, is as absurd as most of the other works of  the same artists. Why should the State which refused the aid of its own  highly trained Indian army of 150,000 men, avail itself of that of  savages? Lord Roberts denied the assertion with befitting warmth, and it  is not again repeated in the course of the despatches.    Lord Roberts in this document was not content with denying the Boer  allegations, but carried the war into the enemy's country:    'I regret to say that it is the Republican forces which have in some  cases been guilty of carrying on the war in a manner not in accordance  with civilised usage. I refer especially to the expulsion of loyal  subjects of Her Majesty from their homes in the invaded districts of  this Colony, because they refused to be commandeered by the invader. It  is barbarous to attempt to force men to take sides against their own  Sovereign and country by threats of spoliation and expulsion. Men,  women, and children have had to leave their homes owing to such  compulsion, and many of those who were formerly in comfortable  circumstances are now being maintained by charity.'    He adds: 'I beg to call your Honours' attention to the wanton  destruction of property by the Boer forces in Natal. They not only have  helped themselves freely to the cattle and other property of farmers  without payment, but they have utterly wrecked the contents of many  farmhouses. As an instance I would specify Mr. Theodore Wood's farm  \"Longwood\" near Springfield. I point out how very different is the  conduct of the British troops. It is reported to me from Modder River  that farms within the actual area of the British Camp have never even  been entered, the occupants are unmolested, and their houses, gardens,  and crops remain absolutely untouched.'    On March 26 Lord Roberts's Proclamation spoke with no uncertain voice  upon the subject of private property. It says:    'The following Proclamation, issued by me in the name of Her Majesty's  Government on the 26th March, begins: Notice is hereby given that all  persons who within the territories of the South African Republic or  Orange Free State shall authorise or be guilty of the wanton destruction  or damage or the counselling, aiding, or assisting in the wanton  destruction or damage of public or private property, such destruction or  damage not being justified by the usages and customs of civilised  warfare, will be held responsible in their persons and property for all  such wanton destruction and damage.'    This was during the period of the halt at Bloemfontein. I can well  remember that then and for long afterwards the consideration which was  shown upon this point seemed to those who were at the spot to be  exaggerated and absurd. I can remember that when we applied for leave to  use the deserted villas to put our sick soldiers into--the hospitals  being full--we were told that it could only be done by private treaty  with the owners, who were at that time on commando against us. I  remember also suggesting that the corrugated-iron fencing round the  cricket field should be used for making huts, and being told that it was  impossible, as it was private property.    The same extreme respect for personal property was shown during Lord  Roberts's advance. The country through which he passed swarmed with  herds and flocks, but, with as scrupulous a regard for the rights of  property as Wellington showed in the south of France, no hungry soldier  was allowed to take so much as a chicken. The punishment for looting was  prompt and stern. It is true that farms were burned occasionally and the  stock confiscated, but this was as a punishment for some particular  offence and not part of a system. The limping Tommy looked askance at  the fat geese which covered the dam by the roadside, but it was as much  as his life was worth to allow his fingers to close round those tempting  white necks. On foul water and bully beef he tramped through a land of  plenty.    A most striking example of British discipline and forbearance was  furnished at this period, while the war could still be called regular  upon the Boer side, by Rundle's Division, christened the 'Hungry Eighth'  by the Army. This Division had the misfortune to be stationed for  several months some distance from the railway line, and in consequence  had great difficulty in getting supplies. They were on half-rations for  a"]]]
