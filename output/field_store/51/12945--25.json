It is the old legend of Genoveva somewhat altered.  Siegfried, Count of  the Palatinate, is ordered by the Emperor Charles Martell to join him  in the war with the infidels, who broke out of Spain under Abdurrhaman.  The noble Count recommends his wife Genoveva and all he possesses, to  the protection of his friend Golo, who is however secretly in love with  his master's wife.  After Siegfried has said farewell she falls into a  swoon, which Golo takes advantage of to kiss her, thereby still further  exciting his flaming passion.  Genoveva finally awakes and goes away to  mourn in silence for her husband.    {106}    Golo being alone, an old hag Margaretha, whom he takes for his nurse,  comes to console him.    She is in reality his mother and has great schemes for her son's future  happiness.  She insinuates to him that Genoveva, being alone, needs  consolation and will easily be led on to accept more tender attentions,  and she promises him her assistance.  The second act show Genoveva's  room.  She longs sadly for her husband and sees with pain and disgust  the insolent behavior of the servants, whose wild songs penetrate into  her silent chamber.    Golo enters to bring her the news of a great victory over Abdurrhaman,  news, which fill her heart with joy.    She bids Golo sing and sweetly accompanies his song, which so fires his  passion that he falls upon his knees and frightens her by glowing  words.  Vainly she bids him leave her; he only grows more excited, till  she repulses him with the word \"bastard\".  Now his love turns into  hatred, and when Drago, the faithful steward comes to announce that the  servants begin to be more and more insolent, daring even to insult the  good name of the Countess, Golo asserts that they speak the truth about  her.  He persuades the incredulous Drago to hide himself in Genoveva's  room, the latter having retired for the night's rest.    Margaretha, listening at the door, hears everything.  She tells Golo  that Count Siegfried lies wounded at Strassbourg; she has intercepted  his {107} letter to the Countess and prepares to leave for that town,  in order to nurse the Count and kill him slowly by some deadly poison.  Then Golo calls quickly for the servants, who all assemble to penetrate  into their mistress' room.  She repulses them full of wounded pride,  but at last she yields, and herself taking the candle to light the room  proceeds to search, when Drago is found behind the curtains and at once  silenced by Golo, who runs his dagger through his heart.  Genoveva is  led into the prison of the castle.    The third act takes place at Strassbourg, where Siegfried is being  nursed by Margaretha.  His strength defies her perfidy, and he is full  of impatience to return to his loving wife, when Golo enters bringing  him the news of her faithlessness.    Siegfried in despair bids Golo kill her with his own sword.  He decides  to fly into the wilderness, but before fulfilling his design, he goes  once more to Margaretha, who has promised to show him all that passed  at home during his absence.  He sees Genoveva in a magic looking-glass,  exchanging kindly words with Drago, but there is no appearance of guilt  in their intercourse.  The third image shows Genoveva sleeping on her  couch, and Drago approaching her.  With an imprecation Siegfried starts  up, bidding Golo avenge him, but at the same instant the glass flies in  pieces with a terrible crash, and Drago's ghost stands before  Margaretha, commanding her to tell Siegfried the truth.    {108}    In the fourth act Genoveva is being led into the wilderness by two  ruffians, who have orders to murder her.  Before this is done, Golo  approaches her once more, showing her Siegfried's ring and sword, with  which he has been bidden kill her.  He tries hard to win her, but she  turns from him with scorn and loathing, preferring death to dishonor.  At length relinquishing his attempts, he beckons to the murderers to do  their work and hands them Count Siegfried's weapon.  Genoveva in her  extreme need seizes the cross of the Saviour, praying fervently, and  detains the ruffians till at the last moment Siegfried appears, led by  the repentant Margaretha.  There ensues a touching scene of  forgiveness, while Golo rushes away to meet his fate by falling over a  precipice.          THE GOLDEN CROSS.    Opera in two acts by IGNAZ BRULL.    Text by MOSENTHAL.      Brull, born at Prossnitz in Moravia, Nov. 7th, 1846, received his  musical education in Vienna and is well known as a good pianist.  He  has composed different operas, of which however the above-mentioned is  the only popular one.    This charming little opera, which rendered its composer famous, has  passed beyond the frontiers of Germany and is now translated into  several languages.    The text is skillfully arranged, and so combined as to awaken our  interest.    {109}    The scene is laid in a village near Melun in the years between 1812 and  15.    Nicolas (or Cola) Pariset, an innkeeper, is betrothed to his cousin  Therese.  Unfortunately just on his wedding-day a sergeant, named  Bombardon, levies him for the army, which is to march against the  Russians.  Vainly does Therese plead for her betrothed, and equally in  vain is it that she is joined in her pleading by Nicolas' sister  Christine.  The latter is passionately attached to her brother, who has  hitherto been her only care.  Finally Christine promises to marry any  man who will go as substitute for her brother.  Gontran de l'Ancry, a  young nobleman, whose heart is touched by the maiden's tenderness and  beauty, places himself at Bombardon's disposal and receives from him  the golden cross, which Christine has placed in his hands, to be  offered as a pledge of fidelity to her brother's deliverer.  Christine  does not get to know him, as Gontran departs immediately.  The act  closes with Cola's marriage.    The second act takes place two years later.  Cola, who could not be  detained from marching against the enemy, has been wounded, but saved  from being killed by an officer, who received the bullet instead.  Both  return to Cola's house as invalids and are tended by the two women.  The strange officer, who is no other than Gontran, loves Christine and  she returns his passion, but deeming herself bound to another, she does  not betray her feeling.  Gontran is about to bid her farewell, but  {110} when in the act of taking leave, he perceives her love and tells  her that he is the officer, who was once substitute for her brother in  the war.    Christine is full of happiness; Gontran when asked for the token of her  promise, tells her, that the cross was taken from him, as he lay  senseless on the field of battle.  At this moment Bombardon, returning  also as invalid, presents the cross to Christine, and she believing  that Gontran has lied to her and that Bombardon is her brother's  substitute, promises her hand to him, with a bleeding heart, but  Bombardon relates that the true owner of the cross has fallen on the  battle-field and that he took it from the dead body.  Christine now  resolves to enter in a convent, when suddenly Gontran's voice is heard.  Bombardon recognizes his friend, whom he believed to be dead,  everything is explained and the scene ends with the marriage of the  good and true lovers.          THE TWO GRENADIERS.    Comic Opera in three acts by ALBERT LORTZING.    Text adapted from the French.      After a long interval of quiet Lortzing's charming music seems to be  brought to honor again and no wonder.--The ears of the public grow  overtired, or may we say over-taxed by Wagner's grand music, which his  followers still surpass, though only in noise and external effects;  they long for simplicity, for melody.  Well, Lortzing's operas overflow  with real, true, simple melody, and {111} generally in genuine good  humour.--For many years only two of his operas have been performed,  viz, \"Undine\" and \"Czar and Zimmermann\".--Now Hamburg has set the good  example, by representing a whole cyclus (seven operas of Lortzing's),  and Dresden has followed with the \"Two Grenadiers.\"    The opera was composed in the year 1837 and is of French origin and  though its music breathes German humour and naivete, the French  influence may be felt clearly.  The persons show life and movement, the  music is light-hearted, graceful and truly comic.    The scene takes place in a little country-town, where we find Busch, a  wealthy inn-keeper, making preparations for the arrival of his only  son.  The young man had entered a Grenadier regiment at the age of  sixteen, ten years before, so the joyful event of his home-coming is  looked forward to with pleasure by his father and sister Suschen, but  with anxiety by a friend of hers, Caroline, to whom young Busch had  been affianced before joining his regiment.    Enter two young Grenadiers from the regiment on leave, the younger of  whom falls in love with Suschen at first sight.  However as the elder  Grenadier, Schwarzbart, dolefully remarks, they are both almost  pennyless and he reflects how he can possibly help them in their need.  His meditations are interrupted by the arrival of the landlord, who,  seeing the two knapsacks, and recognizing one of them as that of his  son, naturally supposes the owner to be his offspring, in which belief  he is {112} confirmed by Schwarzbart, who is induced to practice this  deceit, partly by the desire of getting a good dinner and the means of  quenching his insatiable thirst, partly by the hope of something  turning up in favour of his companion in arms, Wilhelm.  As a matter of  fact the knapsack does not belong to Wilhelm at all.  On leaving the  inn, at which the banquet following the wedding of one of their  comrades, had been held, the knapsacks had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#19)"],[1,"on horseback in presenting the somewhat intractable  subject of _Noah's Ark and the Universal Deluge_.    The preparations had taken a month or six weeks.  The course is for the  arciprete of the Matrice, who is the head of the clergy of the district,  to determine what the story shall be and how it is to be told.  The  designing of each personaggio, or of each group of personaggi, is then  confided to one of the inhabitants, who, provided he bears in mind the  general scheme, is free to follow his natural artistic instincts.  The  dresses are hired from Palermo, and an astonishing quantity of jewellery  is lent by the families of the comune; in 1897 the personaggi carried 85  lbs. weight of it, and far more is always lent than can possibly be used.  It is all gold and precious stones, no silver is to be seen, and nothing  is ever lost, stolen, or mislaid; even the thieves become honest on these  occasions.  It is sewn on to the dresses in various designs and makes  them look very rich, so that what is hired from Palermo is only the  costumes in the rough, so to speak.    In wandering about the town next day, I came upon four or five of the  cars lurking in obscure churches where they had been prepared.  It was  not easy to make much of them; there were a few rocks, banks and clouds,  also the waters of the deluge, all made of papier mache painted to appear  real, and in among the rocks and banks were real plants, mostly the dwarf  palm which grows plentifully on the mountain.  There were wooden supports  for the figures, to help them to stand in their places.  Each car carried  under it an apparatus to supply it with acetylene gas, used in 1901 for  the first time.    All day long people kept on coming up the mountain and pouring into the  town.  Those who did not come on foot left their carts and horses  outside, and they all swarmed up through the narrow, irregular, roughly  paved streets from the Trapani gate to the balio, till by nightfall the  Piazza was as crowded as Piccadilly on Mafeking night.  Every one who has  been present at an Italian festa knows what it is like--men shouting and  elbowing their way through the people with flaming lamps fitted to their  baskets, selling water and syrups, cakes and confectionery, melon seeds  and peanuts--others going about with halfpenny buttonholes of gelsomina,  each neatly folded up in a vine-leaf to keep the scent in--three  independent piano-organs and a brass band in the middle distance--an  enthusiastic blind singer, a survival of Demodocus in the _Odyssey_, with  a falsetto voice and no bridge to his nose keeping a group of listeners  spellbound in the foreground with their favourite ballad, illustrated by  a large sheet of oil paintings in eight tableaux, about the man who  murdered his wife and mother with one bloody knife--there it is lying on  the supper-table--and was ultimately taken by the carabinieri and  executed.    This blind singer with no bridge to his nose is a humorist; on one  occasion when he was fibbing in a particularly flagrant manner, he  enforced his remarks by calling upon heaven to strike him blind and smash  his nose if he was not speaking the truth.    While you are thinking that the tumult must be at its height, peaceful  nuns are creeping up the convent stair, silently, one by one, they reach  the roof, every one can see them collecting together in the moonlight and  taking hold of the dangling bell-ropes.  All of a sudden you realize what  a mistake you had been making about the tumult as the riotous bells fling  their additional accompaniments out into the night, all over the town,  over the whole comune, down to Trapani, to Cofano and out to the islands.    In the meantime those in charge of the cars had been giving their final  directions and seeing that everything was in order, and the personaggi,  who had been being dressed ever since early in the afternoon, were ready  to receive visitors.  About 10 p.m. each of them began to hold an At  Home.  They sat there silent and motionless in their houses among trays  full of superfluous jewellery and surrounded by lighted candles, gazing  imperturbably in front of them while people streamed through the room  admiring them, fingering their dresses and jewels, and asking questions  of their relations and friends.  About 11.30 I was conducted along the  illuminated streets through the crowd to a house where I stood on a  balcony looking up a street down which the procession was to come.    We had to wait till long after midnight, but at last the moving lights  began to shine on the high houses in the distance, the band was heard  approaching, and at 1.45 the first car staggered into sight.  It  represented _The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men_; there were three  of each, reclining in the front part of the car and offering flowers to  one another, instigated so to do by the Monster of Iniquity, a loathsome  dragon, who was insinuating himself among them from rocks behind, while  the Angel of the Lord, a singularly beautiful child, stood on a high  cloud in the background, in an attitude of horror, about to take wing  from such a world of wickedness.  Cupid was there also, sitting at the  feet of the daughters of men and taking aim generally.    The second car brought _Sin_, a bearded man in an imperial attitude with  a golden sceptre resting on his hip.  He dominated a globe round which  the old Serpent had coiled himself.  He was dressed in dark-blue velvet,  and wore a voluminous red cloak.  On his breast was a bunch of grapes,  made entirely of diamond rings; each grape was a separate ring isolated  from the others and so sewn on that the hoop, being passed through a hole  in the material, was not visible, and only the rose of diamonds was  displayed.  There were fifty-five grapes, and they sparkled and glittered  in the flickering lights as the car lurched down the street and passed  the balcony.    The third car represented _The Voice of God_, a beautiful figure of an  Angel blowing a trumpet, and the words written on the cloud behind were  \"Delebo hominem.\"  In the front of the car sat a youth and a girl holding  hands to represent the wicked population destined to destruction.    Then _The Universal Deluge_ came pitching and tossing round the  corner--rather an ambitious car.  The foreground was occupied by the  water, with the head of a drowning man throwing up his arms, and the  indication of another entirely submerged.  The waves were beating against  a steep bank up which a tigress was climbing, carrying her cub in her  mouth.  On the top of the bank stood a lovely woman endeavouring to save  her terrified child.  She was the only living figure on the car,  everything else, even the terrified child, being of papier mache.    _The Ark_ came on the fifth car and had no living figure at all, being  merely Noah's Ark resting on Mount Ararat with a dove in front.  This may  sound rather uninteresting and as though designed to support home  industries, but, to the initiated, it palpitated with significance, for  it symbolized the Madonna herself, the only means of salvation from the  waters of punishment; and as the Ark rested on Mount Ararat while the  flood subsided, so does the Madonna di Custonaci rest upon Mount Eryx  while the calamity is stayed.    No. 6 was _The Sacrifice_ and represented Noah, an imposing old man with  long white hair and beard, standing at an altar where a real sheep lay  dead under a net and his three sons were in front praying.    No. 7 was _The Rainbow_, another lovely girl as an angel standing between  a bank of clouds and a rainbow.  On the breast of this figure was worked  in jewels Noah's dove with an olive-branch; this was particularly  appropriate, as it happens also to be the badge of the town.    The procession was closed by a long car carrying first a band of  musicians, then a chorus of youths attired as angels and crowned with  roses, the whole backed by a sort of temple front framing a copy of the  sacred picture.  This car had to stand still from time to time while its  occupants performed music composed specially for the occasion, and the  continual stopping dictated the movements of the other cars and was  signalled to them by bells, so that there might always be about the same  space between them.    The cars were drawn by men and the figures made no attempt to stand  rigidly still--anything of the kind would have been out of the question,  for they must have been on the move between five and six hours.  The last  car passed my balcony at 3.30, an hour and three-quarters after the first  had come into sight, and one could tell the next day that they had been  through nearly the whole town, for hardly a street was safe to walk  in--they were all so slippery with the wax that had dropped from the  candles.  The constant moving of their limbs by the figures, though they  never lost the general idea of the attitude, together with the tottering  motion caused by the roughness of the paving, prevented any sense of the  pose plastique or living picture.    Every one of the female figures, except _The Voice of God_, had her  breast encrusted with jewels, usually in a floral design, and the borders  of their dresses were heavy with jewellery; the male figures also wore as  much as could be suitably sewn on their costumes.    Omitting consideration of the final car, which was there to close the  procession and bring on the music and the Madonna, and also of the Ark,  which could hardly have been otherwise, there were six cars, three  carrying groups and three practically single figures, for the boy and  girl at the feet of _The Voice of God_, though they were the children of  Donna Anna, my landlady, were not really necessary.  Of the groups, the  one representing _The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men_ was certainly  the finest.  It told its story in the right way and was full of the right  kind of imagination.  _The Sacrifice_"]]]
