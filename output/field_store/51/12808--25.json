You would place yourself in a fine situation by declaring  yourself the persecutrix of Voltaire. Only an enemy could have thus  advised you.\"    \"That enemy was comte Jean.\"    \"Then your imprudence equals your zeal. Do you not perceive the  advantage it would give to your adversaries were we to act in this  manner? To the hatred of the court would be united that of the  _literati_, women, and young persons. Voltaire is a god, who is not to  be smitten without sacrilege.\"    \"Must I then tamely submit to be beaten?\"    \"Yes, for the moment. But it will not last long; I have just written  this letter to M. de Voltaire, that peace may be made between you:--    \"SIR,--The superiority of your genius places you amongst the number of  the potentates of Europe. Every one desires, not only to be at peace  with you, but even, if it be possible, to obtain your esteem. I flatter  myself with being included in the ranks of your admirers; my uncle has  spoken to you many times of my attachment to your person, and I embrace  the opportunity of proving this by a means that now presents itself.    \"Persons in whom you place too much confidence have spread abroad, under  your name, copies of a poem, entitled '_La Cour du Roi Petaud._' In  this, wherein insult is cast on a personage who should be exempt from  such offence, is also outraged, in a most indecent way, a lovely female,  whom you would adore as we do, if you had the happiness to know her. Is  it for the poet of the lover of Gabrielle to carry desolation into the  kingdom of the Graces?    \"Your correspondents use you ill by leaving you in ignorance, that this  young person has immense favor here; that we are all at her feet; that  she is all powerful, and her anger is to be particularly avoided. She  is the more to be propitiated, as yesterday, in Presence of a certain  person whom your verses had greatly irritated, she took up your defence  with as much grace as generosity. You see, sir, that you ought not to be  on bad terms with her.    \"My uncle allows me to see, as one of the initiated, what you call your  scraps, which are delicious feasts to us. I read them to the lady in  question, who takes great delight in reciting, or hearing others recite,  your verses, and she begs you will send her some as a proof of your  repentance. Under these circumstances, if your bellicose disposition  urges you on to war, we hope, before you continue it, that you will  loyally and frankly declare it.    \"In conclusion, be assured that I shall defend you to my utmost, and am  for life,    \"Yours, etc.\"    Whilst we were awaiting Voltaire's reply, I determined to avenge myself  on the duchesse de Grammont, who had encouraged him in his attack; and  thus did I serve this lady. Persuaded that she did not know the writing  of his Danish majesty, I wrote the following letter to her:--    \"MADAME LA DUCHESSE,--I have struggled to this time to avoid confessing  to you how I am subdued. Happy should I be could I throw myself at your  feet. My rank alone must excuse my boldness. Nothing would equal my  joy if this evening, at the theatre at madame de Villeroi's, you would  appear with blue feathers in your head-dress. I do not add my name; it  is one of those which should not be found at the bottom of a declaration  of love.\"    In spite of all her penetration, the duchesse de Grammont did not  perceive, in the emphatic tone of this letter, that it was a trick.  Her self-love made her believe that a woman of more than forty could be  pleasing to a king not yet twenty. She actually went in the evening to  madame de Villeroi's dressed in blue, with a blue plumed head-dress. She  was placed next to his Danish majesty. Christian VII addressed her in  most courteous terms, but not one word of love.    The duchesse imagining that the prince was timid, looked at him with  eyes of tenderness, and endeavored to attract and encourage him by all  means she could devise, but the monarch did not understand her. The  duchesse then addressed a few words, which she hoped would lead to  an explanation, but, to her dismay, his majesty did not appear to  understand her. Madame de Grammont was furious at this affair. The duc  d'Aiguillon, who was close to her, had seen all, heard all, and related  particulars to me. The same day I told the king of my trick and  its success. He laughed excessively, and then scolded me for at all  compromising his Danish majesty.    \"How, sire?\" was my reply. \"I did not sign his name; I have not forged  his signature. The vanity of the duchesse has alone caused all the  ridiculous portion of this joke. So much the worse for her if she did  not succeed.\"    I did not, however, limit my revenge to this. A second letter, in  the same hand, was addressed to my luckless enemy. This time she was  informed that she been made a butt of, and mystified. I learned from M.  de Sartines, who, after our compact, gave me details of all, the methods  she had pursued to detect the author of these two epistles, and put  a termination to all these inquiries, by denouncing myself to M. de  Sartines; who then gave such a turn to the whole matter, that the  duchesse could never arrive at the truth.    Voltaire, in the meantime, was not slow in reply; and as I imagine that  you will not be sorry to read his letter, I transcribe it for you:--    \"MONSIEUR LE DUC,--I am a lost, destroyed man. If I had strength enough  to fly, I do not know where I should find courage to take refuge. I!  Good God! I am suspected of having attacked that which, in common with  all France, I respect! When there only remains to me the smallest power  of utterance, but enough to chant a _De profundis,_ that I should employ  it in howling at the most lovely and amiable of females! Believe me,  monsieur le duc, that it is not at the moment when a man is about to  render up his soul, that a man of my good feeling would outrage the  divinity whom he adores. No, I am not the author of the '_Cour du Roi  Petaud._' The verses of this rhapsody are not worth much, it is true;  but indeed they are not mine: they are too miserable, and of too bad a  style. All this vile trash spread abroad in my name, all those pamphlets  without talent, make me lose my senses, and now I have scarcely enough  left to defend myself with. It is on you, monsieur le duc, that I rely;  do not refuse to be the advocate of an unfortunate man unjustly accused.  Condescend to say to this young lady, that I have been before embroiled  with madame de Pompadour, for whom I professed the highest esteem;  tell her, that at the present day especially, the favorite of Caesar is  sacred for me; that my heart and pen are hers, and that I only aspire to  live and die under her banner.    \"As to the scraps you ask for, I have not at this moment any suitable.  Only the best viands are served up at the table of the goddesses. If  I had any I would present them to the person of whom you speak to me.  Assure her, that one day the greatest merit of my verse will be to have  them recited by her lips; and entreat her, until she bestows immortality  on me, to permit me to prostrate myself at her beautiful feet.    \"I will not conclude my letter, monsieur le duc, without thanking you  a thousand times for the advice you have given me. This proof of your  kindness will, if possible augment the sincere attachment I bear to you.  I salute you with profound respect.\"    As it is bold to hold the pen after having transcribed anything of M. de  Voltaire's, I leave off here for to-day.        CHAPTER X      When is the presentation to take place?--Conversation on this subject  with the king--M. de Maupeou and M. de la Vauguyon--Conversation on  the same subject with the king and the duc de Richelieu--M. de  la Vrilliere--M. Bertin---Louis XV and the comtesse--The king's  promise--The fire-works, an anecdote--The marquise de Castellane--M. de  Maupeou at the duc de Choiseul's--The duchesse de Grammont    In spite of the love of the duchesse de Grammont, the king of Denmark  departed at last. Louis XV having resumed his former habits, I began  to meditate seriously on my presentation; and my friends employed  themselves to the utmost in furthering my desires and insuring my  triumph.    The chancellor, who each day became more attached to my interests,  opened the campaign. One day, when the king was in a rage with the  parliaments, the chancellor seized the opportunity to tell him that  the cabal, who were opposed to my presentation, testified so much  resistance, under the idea, and in the hope, that they would be  supported by the parliaments of Paris.    \"If your majesty,\" added the chancellor, \"had less condescension towards  these malcontents, they would fear your authority more.\"    \"You will see,\" replied the king, \"that it will be their audacity which  will urge me on to a step, which otherwise I should wish to avoid.\"    Whilst the hatred which M. de Maupeou bore towards the parliaments  served me in this way, the love of M. de la Vauguyon for the Jesuits  turned to even more advantage. The good duke incessantly talked to me of  his dear Jesuits; and I as constantly replied, that my influence would  not be salutary until after my presentation, M. de la Vauguyon had  sense enough to perceive the embarrassment of my situation, and saw  that before I could think of others I must think of myself. Having taken  \"sweet counsel\" with the powerful heads of his company, he freely gave  me all his influence with the king.    Fortune sent me an auxiliary not less influential than these two  gentlemen; I mean the marechal duc de Richelieu. In the month of  January, 1769, he returned from his government of Guienne to enter on  service. He had much credit with the king, and this (would you believe  it?) resulted from his reputation as a man of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#19)"],[1,"coating of white earth with which their  bodies were covered is an excellent non-conductor. However, the thought  that their bodies might have been thus ingeniously protected lessened  little, if any, the effect produced on the spectator. I have seen many  fire scenes on the stage, many acts of fire eating and fire handling by  civilized jugglers, and many fire dances by other Indian tribes, but  nothing quite comparable to this in all its scenic effects.    150. The closing ceremonies I did not witness on this occasion, but I  saw them at subsequent dances. Shortly before sunrise an assistant  passed around the fire four times and sprinkled a little water on the  mass of smoldering embers, while the medicine man chanted the  appropriate song. Later, three gaps were torn in the circle of  branches--one in the south, one in the west, and one in the  north--making, with the original gate in the east, four entrances to the  corral. (See Plate XIV.) Just after sunrise the entire circle of  branches was razed, but the branches were not carried away. The traveler  through the Navajo country often encounters withered remains of these  circles. In the ceremony of October, 1884, the chanter, having another  engagement which was pressing, packed up his sacred utensils and left  soon after sunrise. The patient, it was said, was not permitted to sleep  until after sunset.    151. _Other dances._ In subsequent dances I saw exhibitions which did  not occur in the ceremony of November 5, 1882, just described, and I  have learned of other shows produced on the last night, which I have  never had an opportunity to witness. All the alilis may be modified.  I have rarely seen two performances of the same dance which were just  alike.    152. On two occasions I have witnessed a very pretty dance, in which an  eagle plume was stuck upright in a basket and by means of some well  hidden mechanism caused to dance in good time to the song, the beat of  the drum, and the motions of the single Indian who danced at the same  time; not only this, but the feather followed the motions of the Indian:  if he danced toward the north, the feather leaned to the north while  making its rhythmical motions; if he moved to the south, it bent its  white head in the same direction, and so on. On one occasion it was a  little boy, five years old, son of the chief Manuelito, who danced with  the eagle plume. He was dressed and painted much like the akÃ¡ninili, or  the arrow swallowers (Figs. 54, 55), on a diminutive scale. The sash of  scarlet velvet around his hips was beautifully trimmed with feathers.  They said he had been several weeks in training for the dance, and he  certainly went through his varied motions with great skill. I have  rarely seen a terpsichorean spectacle that struck my fancy more than  that of the little Indian child and his partner, the eagle plume.    153. It might be thought that the word \"thÃ²hay,\" so often used to make  inanimate objects pay attention, was one of very sacred import. So it  is, no doubt; yet I have seen it broadly burlesqued. It was on the  occasion of the last \"chant\" which I attended. A number of boys, from  twelve to fifteen years of age they seemed, led by a pleasant looking  old man with a skeptical twinkle in his eye, came into the dark circle.  One of the party carried a deep Indian basket, from the top of which a  number of spruce twigs protruded. They formed what has been designated  as the ring of occultation, and while doing so they shouted and screamed  and puffed the talismanic \"thÃ²hay\" in a way that left no doubt of their  intention to ridicule. Their extravagant motions added to the  significance of their intonation. When the ring opened the boys sat on  the ground and began to sing and beat a drum. The old man sat at a  distance of about three paces west of the basket. Presently the nose of  a little weasel (the image being probably a stuffed skin) appeared among  the spruce boughs. All the timid, inquiring motions of the little animal  were well mimicked: the nose was thrust forward and pulled back, the  whole head would emerge and retreat, and at rare times the shoulders  would be seen for a moment, to be quickly drawn in among the screening  spruce twigs. All these motions were made in perfect time to the singing  and drumming. The old man who pulled the actuating strings made no  secret of his manipulations. The play was intended for a farce, and as  such the spectators enjoyed it.          THE GREAT PICTURES OF DSILYÃDJE QAÃÃL.      154. A description of the four great pictures drawn in these ceremonies  has been deferred until all might be described together. Their relations  to one another rendered this the most desirable course to pursue. The  preparation of the ground and of the colors, the application of the  sacred pollen, and some other matters have been already considered.    155. The men who do the greater part of the actual work of painting,  under the guidance of the chanter, have been initiated, but need not be  skilled medicine men or even aspirants to the craft of the shaman.  A certain ceremony of initiation has been performed on them four times,  each time during the course of a different dance, before they are  admitted into the lodge during the progress of the work or allowed to  assist in it. The medicine man receives a good present in horses for his  work; the assistants get nothing but their food. This, however, is  abundant. Three times a day the person for whose benefit the dance is  performed sends in enough mush, corn cake, soup, and roasted mutton to  satisfy to the utmost the appetites of all in the lodge. There are some  young men who live well all winter by going around the country from  dance to dance and assisting in the work of the lodge.      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. XIV    THE DARK CIRCLE OF BRANCHES AT SUNRISE.]    156. The pictures are drawn according to an exact system. The shaman is  frequently seen correcting the workmen and making them erase and revise  their work. In certain well defined instances the artist is allowed to  indulge his individual fancy. This is the case with the gaudy  embroidered pouches which the gods carry at the waist. Within reasonable  bounds the artist may give his god just as handsome a pouch as he  wishes. Some parts of the figures, on the other hand, are measured by  palms and spans, and not a line of the sacred design can be varied.  Straight and parallel lines are drawn by aid of a tightened cord. The  mode of applying the colored powder is peculiar. The artist has his bark  trays laid on the sand where they are convenient of access. He takes a  small quantity of the powder in his closed palm and allows it to pass  out between his thumb and forefinger, while the former is moved across  the latter. When he makes a mistake he does not brush away the pigment.  He obliterates it by pouring sand on it, and then draws the corrected  design on the new surface. The forms of the gods do not appear as I have  represented them in the first coat of color. The naked figures of these  mythical beings are first completely and accurately drawn and then the  clothing is put on. Even in the pictures of the \"Long-bodies\"  (Plate XVII), which are drawn 9 feet in length, the naked body is first  made in its appropriate color--white for the east, blue for the south,  yellow for the west, and black for the north--and then the four red  shirts are painted on from thigh to axilla, as shown in the picture.    157. The drawings are, as a rule, begun as much towards the center as  the nature of the figure will permit, due regard being paid to the order  of precedence of the points of the compass, the figure in the east being  begun first, that in the south next, that in the west third in order,  and that in the north fourth. The periphery is finished last of all. The  reason for thus working from within outwards is that the men employed on  the picture disturb the smooth surface of the sand with their feet. If  they proceed in the order described they can smooth the sand as they  advance and need not cross the finished portions of the picture.    158. I have learned of seventeen great healing dances of the Navajo in  which pictures of this character are drawn. There are said to be, with  few exceptions--only one exception that I am positively aware of--four  pictures appropriate to each dance. Some of the dances are practiced  somewhat differently by different schools or orders among the medicine  men, and in these divers forms the pictures, although agreeing in  general design, vary somewhat in detail. Thus there are, on an average,  probably more than four designs, belonging to each of the seventeen  ceremonies, whose names I have obtained. If there were but four to each,  this would give us sixty-eight such paintings known to the medicine men  of the tribe, and thus we may form some conception of the great number  of these sacred pictures which they possess. But I have reason to  believe, from many things I have heard, that besides these seventeen  great nine days' ceremonies to which I refer, there are many minor  ceremonies, with their appropriate pictures; so that the number is  probably greater than that which I give.    159. These pictures, the medicine men aver, are transmitted from teacher  to pupil in each order and for each ceremony unaltered from year to year  and from generation to generation. That such is strictly the case I  cannot believe. There are no standard pictures on hand anywhere. No  permanent design for reference is ever in existence, and there is, so  far as I can learn, no final authority in the tribe to settle any  disputes that may arise. Few of these great ceremonies can be performed  in the summer months. Most of the figures are therefore carried over  from winter to winter in the memories of fallible men. But this much I  do credit, that any innovations which may"]]]
