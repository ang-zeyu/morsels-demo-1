One day, when he was  unusually angry about what his wife had told him, he called the young  girl, and said:--    \"My dear child, your mother is always saying that you are disobedient  to her, have a spiteful tongue, and are wicked, so that it is not  possible for you to stay any longer in my house; therefore go wherever  the Lord may guide you, that there may no longer be so much quarreling  here on your account. But I advise you as a father, wherever you may  go, to be obedient, humble, and industrious, for here with me all your  faults have been overlooked, parental affection has aided, but among  strangers nobody knows what sort of people you may meet, and they will  not indulge you as we have done.\"    When the poor girl saw that her step-mother and her daughter wanted to  drive her out of the house at any cost, she kissed her father's hand  with tears in her eyes, and went out into the wide world without any  hope of ever returning home. She walked along the road till she  chanced to meet a little sick dog, so thin that one could count its  ribs.    When the dog saw her, it said: \"You beautiful, industrious girl, have  pity on me and take care of me, I will reward you some day.\"    The girl did pity the poor animal, and, taking it in her arms, washed  and cleaned it thoroughly. Then she left it and went on, glad that she  had been able to do a good action. She had not walked far when she  came to a fine pear-tree in full bloom, but it was completely covered  with caterpillars.    When the pear-tree saw the girl, it said: \"You beautiful, industrious  girl, take care of me and rid me of these caterpillars, I will repay  you for it some day.\"    The girl, with her usual diligence, cleared the pear-tree from its dry  branches and most carefully removed the caterpillars; then she walked  quietly on to seek some place where she might enter into service.    On her way she came to a ruined, neglected fountain, which said to  her: \"You beautiful, industrious girl, take care of me, I will reward  you some day.\"    The little maid cleared the fountain, cleaned it thoroughly, and then  went on again. As she walked she came to a dilapidated oven, which had  become almost entirely useless.    As soon as the oven saw her, it said: \"You beautiful, industrious  girl, line me with stones and clean me, I will repay you some day!\"    The young girl knew that work harms no one, so she rolled up her  sleeves, moistened some clay, stopped the holes in the stove, greased  it and cleaned it till it was a pleasure to see it. Then she washed  her hands and continued her journey. As she walked on, day and night,  it happened, I don't know how--that she missed her way; yet she did  not lose her trust in God, but walked on and on until early one  morning, after passing through a dark forest, she reached a beautiful  meadow. In the meadow she saw a little house, completely overgrown  with vines, and when she approached it an old woman came out kindly to  meet her, and said: \"What are you seeking here, child, and who are  you?\"    \"Who should I be, good dame! A poor girl, motherless, and I may say  fatherless, too, for God alone knows what I have suffered since my own  mother's hands were folded on her breast. I am seeking service, and as  I know nobody and am wandering from place to place I have lost my way.  But the Lord guided me, so that I have reached your house and I beg  you to give me a shelter.\"    \"Poor child!\" replied the old dame. \"Surely God himself has led you to  me and saved you from danger. I am the goddess of Sunday. Serve me  to-day, and I promise that you shall not leave my house empty-handed  to-morrow.\"    \"Very well, but I don't know what I have to do.\"    \"You must wash and feed my little children, who are now asleep, and  then cook my dinner; when I come home from church I want to find it  neither hot nor cold, but just right to eat.\"    When she had said this, the old woman set off for church. The young  girl rolled up her sleeves and went to work. First of all she prepared  the water for the bath, then went out-doors and began to call:  \"Children, children, children, come to mother and let her wash you.\"    When she looked up, what did she behold? The court-yard was filled  and the woods were swarming with a host of dragons and all sorts of  wild beasts of every size. But, firm in her faith and trust in God,  the young girl did not quail, but taking one animal after another  washed and cleaned it in the best possible way. Then she set about  cooking the dinner, and when Sunday came out of church and saw her  children so nicely washed and every thing so well done she was greatly  delighted. After she had sat down to the table, she told the young  girl that she might go up into the attic, choose whichever chest she  wanted, and take it away with her for her wages; but she must not open  it until she reached her father's house.    The maiden went to the garret, where there were a number of chests,  some old and ugly, others new and beautiful. But as she was not a bit  covetous, she took the oldest and ugliest of them all. When she came  down with it, the goddess of Sunday frowned slightly, but there was no  help for it, so she blessed the girl, who took her trunk on her back  and joyfully returned to her father's house.    On the way, lo and behold! there was the oven full of beautifully  risen, nicely browned cakes. The girl ate and ate, as many as she  could, then took some with her for her journey and went on. Soon she  came to the fountain she had cleaned, and which was now filled to the  brim with water as clear as tears and as sweet and cold as ice. On the  edge stood two silver goblets, from which she drank the water until  she was entirely refreshed. Then, taking one goblet with her, she  walked on. As she went, lo and behold! there stood the pear-tree she  had cleaned, full of pears as yellow as wax, perfectly ripe, and as  sweet as honey. When the pear-tree saw the girl, it bent its branches  down to her, and she ate some of the fruit and took more pears to eat  on the way, just as many of them as she wanted. From there she  journeyed on again, and lo and behold! she next met the little dog,  which was now well and handsome; around its neck it wore a collar of  ducats which it gave the old man's daughter as a reward for taking  care of it in its sickness.    So the young girl at last reached her father's house. When the old man  saw her his eyes filled with tears and his heart throbbed with joy.  The girl took out the dog's collar and the silver goblet and gave them  to her father; when they opened the chest together, out came countless  numbers of horses, cattle, and sheep, till the sight of so much wealth  instantly made the old man young again. But his wife stood as if she  were dazed, and did not know what to do in her rage. Her daughter,  however, plucked up courage and said:--    \"Never mind, mother, the world isn't emptied yet; I'll go and fetch  you still greater treasures.\"    After saying this she angrily set off at once. She walked and walked  along the same path her step-sister had followed. She, too, met the  sick, feeble dog, passed the pear-tree covered with caterpillars, the  dry, neglected fountain, and the dilapidated oven which had become  almost useless; but when dog, tree, fountain and oven begged her to  take care of them, she answered rudely and scornfully: \"Do you  suppose I'll soil my delicate hands! Have you often been tended by  people like me?\"    As they all knew that it is easier to get milk from a dry cow than to  make a spoiled, lazy girl obliging, they let her go her way in peace,  and no longer asked her for help. As she walked on and on, she too at  last reached the Goddess Sunday. But here also she behaved sullenly,  saucily, and awkwardly. Instead of cooking the dinner nicely and  washing Sunday's children as thoroughly as her step-sister had done,  she burned them all till they screamed and ran off as though crazed by  the burns and the pain. The food she scorched, charred, and let curdle  so that no one could eat it, and when Sunday came home from church she  covered her eyes and ears in horror at what she found in her house.  Even the gentle, indulgent goddess could not get along with such an  obstinate, lazy girl as this one, so she told her to go up into the  garret, choose any chest she wanted, and then in God's name continue  her journey.    The girl went, took the newest and handsomest trunk, for she liked to  get as much as possible of the best and finest things, but was not  willing to do faithful service. When she came down she did not go to  the Goddess Sunday to receive her blessing, but hurried off as if she  were quitting an evil house. She nearly ran herself off her feet, in  the fear that her mistress might change her mind and follow her to get  her trunk back. When she reached the oven there were some nice cakes  in it, but when she approached to satisfy her hunger the fire burned  her and she could take none. The silver goblets were again at the  fountain and the fountain was full of water to the brim, but when the  girl tried to seize the cup to drink, the goblets instantly vanished,  the water dried up, and the girl almost died of thirst. When she came  to the pear tree it stood full of pears, but do you suppose the  traveler could taste even one of them? No! The tree had made itself a  thousand times as tall as before, so that its boughs touched the  clouds! So the old woman's daughter might pick her teeth, she obtained  nothing else. Going further on she met the dog, which again had a  collar of ducats round its neck; but when the girl tried to take it  off the dog bit her so that he tore off her fingers and would not let  her touch him. The girl, in rage and shame, sucked her delicate little  hands, but it did no good.    At "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#19)"],[1,"at the close of the eighteenth  century, while Lamarck was meditating his _Hydrogeologie_, and had begun  to study the invertebrate fossils of the Paris tertiary basin.    His object, he says in his work, is to present certain considerations  which he believed to be new and of the first order, which had escaped  the notice of physicists, and which seemed to him should serve as the  foundations for a good theory of the earth. His theses are:      1. What are the natural consequences of the influence and the    movements of the waters on the surface of the globe?      2. Why does the sea constantly occupy a basin within the limits    which contain it, and there separate the dry parts of the surface of    the globe always projecting above it?      3. Has the ocean basin always existed where we actually see it, and    if we find proofs of the sojourn of the sea in places where it no    longer remains, by what cause was it found there, and why is it no    longer there?      4. What influence have living bodies exerted on the substances found    on the surface of the earth and which compose the crust which    invests it, and what are the general results of this influence?    Lamarck then disclaims any intentions of framing brilliant hypotheses  based on supposititious principles, but nevertheless, as we shall see,  he falls into this same error, and like others of his period makes some  preposterous hypotheses, though these are far less so than those of  Cuvier's _Discours_. He distinguishes between the action of rivers or of  fresh-water currents, torrents, storms, the melting of snow, and the  work of the ocean. The rivers wear away and bear materials from the  highlands to the lowlands, so that the plains are gradually elevated;  ravines form and become immense valleys, and their sides form elevated  crests and pass into mountain ranges.    He brings out and emphasizes the fact, now so well known, that the  erosive action of rain and rivers has formed mountains of a certain  class.      \"It is then evident to me, that every mountain which is not the    result of a _volcanic irruption_ or of some local catastrophe, has    been carved out from a plain, where its mass is gradually formed,    and was a part of it; hence what in this case are the summits of    the mountains are only the remains of the former level of the plain    unless the process of washing away and other means of degradation    have not since reduced its height.\"    Now this will apply perfectly well to our table-lands, mesas, the  mountains of our bad-lands, even to our Catskills and to many elevations  of this nature in France and in northern Africa. But Lamarck  unfortunately does not stop here, but with the zeal of an innovator, by  no means confined to his time alone, claims that the mountain masses of  the Alps and the Andes were carved out of plains which had been raised  above the sea-level to the present heights of those mountains.    Two causes, he says, have concurred in forming these elevated plains.      \"One consists in the continual accumulation of material filling the    portion of the ocean-basin from which the same seas slowly retreat;    for it does not abandon those parts of the ocean-basin which are    situated nearer and nearer to the shores that it tends to leave,    until after having filled its bottom and having gradually raised it.    It follows that the coasts which the sea is abandoning are never    made by a very deep-lying formation, however often it appears to be    such, for they are continually elevated as the result of the    perpetual balancing of the sea, which casts off from its shores all    the sediments brought down by the rivers; in such a way that the    great depths of the ocean are not near the shore from which the sea    retreats, but out in the middle of the ocean and near the opposite    shores which the sea tends to invade.      \"The other cause, as we shall see, is found in the detritus of    organic bodies successively accumulated, which perpetually elevates,    although with extreme slowness, the soil of the dry portions of the    globe, and which does it all the more rapidly, as the situation of    these parts gives less play to the degradation of the surface caused    by the rivers.      \"Doubtless a plain which is destined some day to furnish the    mountains which the rivers will carve out from its mass would have,    when still but a little way from the sea, but a moderate elevation    above its river channels; but gradually as the ocean basin removed    from this plain, this basin constantly sinking down into the    interior (_epaisseur_) of the external crust of the globe, and the    soil of the plain perpetually rising higher from the deposition of    the detritus of organic bodies, it results that, after ages of    elevation of the plain in question, it would be in the end    sufficiently thick for high mountains to be shaped and carved out of    its mass.      \"Although the ephemeral length of life of man prevents his    appreciation of this fact, it is certain that the soil of a plain    unceasingly acquires a real increase in its elevation in proportion    as it is covered with different plants and animals. Indeed the    debris successively heaped up for numerous generations of all these    beings which have by turns perished, and which, as the result of the    action of their organs, have, during the course of this life, given    rise to combinations which would never have existed without this    means, most of the principles which have formed them not being    borrowed from the soil; this debris, I say, wasting successively on    the soil of the plain in question, gradually increases the thickness    of its external bed, multiplies there the mineral matters of all    kinds and gradually elevates the formation.\"    Our author, as is evident, had no conception, nor had any one else at  the time he wrote, of the slow secular elevation of a continental  plateau by crust-movements, and Lamarck's idea of the formation of  elevated plains on land by the accumulation of debris of organisms is  manifestly inadequate, our aerial or eolian rocks and loess being  wind-deposits of sand and silt rather than matters of organic origin.  Thus he cites as an example of his theory the vast elevated plains of  Tartary, which he thought had been dry land from time immemorable,  though we now know that the rise took place in the quaternary or present  period. On the other hand, given these vast elevated plains, he was  correct in affirming that rivers flowing through them wore out enormous  valleys and carved out high mountains, left standing by atmospheric  erosion, for examples of such are to be seen in the valley of the Nile,  the Colorado, the Upper Missouri, etc.    He then distinguishes between granitic or crystalline mountains, and  those composed of stratified rocks and volcanic mountains.    The erosive action of rivers is thus discussed; they tend first, he  says, to fill up the ocean basins, and second, to make the surface of  the land broken and mountainous, by excavating and furrowing the plains.    Our author did not at all understand the causes of the inclination or  tilting up of strata. Little close observation or field work had yet  been done, and the rocks about Paris are but slightly if at all  disturbed. He attributes the dipping down of strata to the inclination  of the shores of the sea, though he adds that nevertheless it is often  due to local subsidences. And then he remarks that \"indeed in many  mountains, and especially in the Pyrenees, in the very centre of these  mountains, we observe that the strata are for the most part either  vertical or so inclined that they more or less approach this direction.\"      \"But,\" he asks, \"should we conclude from this that there has    necessarily occurred a universal catastrophe, a general overturning?    This assumption, so convenient for those naturalists who would    explain all the facts of this kind without taking the trouble to    observe and study the course which nature follows, is not at all    necessary here; for it is easy to conceive that the inclined    direction of the beds in the mountains may have been produced by    other causes, and especially by causes more natural and less    hypothetical than a general overturning of strata.\"    While streams of fresh water tend to fill up and destroy the ocean  basins, he also insists that the movements of the sea, such as the  tides, currents, storms, submarine volcanoes, etc., on the contrary,  tend to unceasingly excavate and reestablish these basins. Of course we  now know that tides and currents have no effect in the ocean depths,  though their scouring effects near shore in shallow waters have locally  had a marked effect in changing the relations of land and sea. Lamarck  went so far as to insist that the ocean basin owes its existence and its  preservation to the scouring action of the tides and currents.    The earth's interior was, in Lamarck's opinion, solid, formed of  quartzose and silicious rocks, and its centre of gravity did not  coincide with its geographical centre, or what he calls the _centre de  forme_. He imagined also that the ocean revolved around the globe from  east to west, and that this movement, by its continuity, displaced the  ocean basin and made it pass successively over all the surface of the  earth.    Then, in the third chapter, he asks if the basin of the sea has always  been where we now actually see it, and whether we find proofs of the  sojourn of the sea in the place where it is now absent; if so, what are  the causes of these changes. He reiterates his strange idea of a general  movement of the ocean from east to west, at the rate of at least three  leagues in twenty-four hours and due to the moon's influence. And here  Lamarck, in spite of his uniformitarian principles, is strongly  cataclysmic. What he seems to have in mind is the"]]]
