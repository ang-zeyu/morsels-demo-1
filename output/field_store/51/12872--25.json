At Discovery Claim, instead of a few straggling tents, there were eating  houses, saloons, store-houses, a ticket and post-office, and the nucleus  of a town. The cars we boarded were open, flat cars, with seats along  the sides, to be sure, but they were crowded at one dollar per head to  Nome. After waiting a little time for a start, the whistle blew shrilly,  the conductor shouted \"all aboard!\" and we trundled along behind a  smoky, sturdy engine in almost civilized style.    This was the first railroad in Alaska with the exception of the White  Pass and Yukon road, and will eventually extend to the southern coast  and Iliamna.    Next morning, after spending the night on the Sandspit with madam, I  called, bright and early, upon my Swedish friends in their restaurant.    \"Good morning, Mrs. Sullivan!\" cried Mary in a hearty voice, as she  stirred the steaming mush on the kitchen range.    \"Good morning!\" said Ricka more quietly, but with a pleasant, welcoming  smile. \"Did you come from Number Nine?\"    \"Good morning!\" from Alma, as she poured a cup of hot coffee for a  waiting customer. \"Do you want to help us? We have plenty of work.\"    \"That's what I came for,\" said I, laying aside my hat and coat. \"Will  you lend me an apron till I get mine?\" glancing toward the kitchen sink  full of unwashed dishes, and the cupboard shelves quite demoralized.    \"I'll lend you six if you will only help us. We are so busy serving  meals we cannot take time to get settled,\" said Mary. \"Yes, we moved  from the tent last week,\" she said in reply to my question.    \"We like this much better. The tent leaked during the hard rains, and  flapped so much in the wind that we were afraid it would come down upon  our heads. We have had this kitchen built on, and shall keep open till  the last boats are gone for the winter. That will be two months longer,  likely,\" and Mary talked on as she dished up the griddle cakes and the  two others waited upon the tables.    I felt quite happy to have found work so soon, and that too among  friends, and without any particular responsibility attached to the  position. I would dignify my labor, doing it well and acceptably,  carrying always a sunny face and pleasing mood. The work was of a kind  despised by hundreds of women, who, after landing at Nome, had not found  agreeable and genteel situations, and so had gone back home, or, in  some cases, done even worse.    To be sure, the pay was not large, the work tiresome, and I would be  snubbed by many persons, but I had not come to Alaska for my health.  That was excellent. Then I had good food in sufficient quantities, which  was always a thing to be considered in that country. I had a purpose in  view which I never lost. I would get some gold claims.    The Swedish people were brave and fearless, as well as patient and  strong. I had many acquaintances among them already. I felt they were  good people to stay with, and they were congenial. To be sure, a few  spoke English with an accent, and there were no small, white hands among  them; but if the hearts and lives were clean and true, and so far as I  could judge they were so, I was satisfied.    The missionaries from Golovin, including the young lady who had come up  on the \"St. Paul,\" had, with my three friends here, called at Number  Nine at different times during the six weeks of our stay there. Already  a plan had been considerably discussed which would take a party of us to  Golovin to winter, either in the Swedish mission or near it, and of all  things in mind so far this prospect most pleased me.    We would then be fifty miles from the rich Council City mines on the  Fish River Creeks, and only half that distance from the Topkok diggings,  of which we now heard considerable. Every creek within many miles  around Nome was entirely staked, but in the vicinity of Golovin we might  hope to secure claims, or, at least, be in a good position to learn of  new gold strikes if any were made during the coming winter.    \"But we will keep a roadhouse if we go there,\" said Alma, \"and be making  some money. I am sure there will be many people traveling through  Golovin all winter, and we can make a few dollars that way as well as  any one else. Then we will not forget how to cook,\" and the young woman,  with eyes always open to the main chance for \"making money,\" as she  called it, laughed at the bare possibility of such a thing.    \"We might do that and help in the mission, too, there are so many of us.  I would like to work in the mission for a change, I think,\" said Ricka,  who was very religiously inclined and quiet generally.    \"What would you like to do, Mrs. Sullivan?\" asked Mary. \"You say so  little, and we talk so much. I want to know what you think.\"    \"Well, there are three of you to talk, and I am only one,\" said I,  laughing, as I placed the cups and saucers, all clean and shining, on  the cupboard shelves. \"I should like the mission plan better than  anything, for I have had some experience in mission work; but if they do  not need us there, then I should like the roadhouse well enough, though  I think if eight or ten of us, each having enough supplies for himself  for the winter, should form a club and live under one roof, we could do  so more cheaply and comfortably than any other way, and have a real  jolly, good time in the bargain. These young men, many of them, are  intending to winter here somewhere, and all hate to cook for themselves,  I know, while they would gladly get the wood, water, and shovel snow, if  we did the cooking and housework. None need to work hard, and if a rich  gold strike were reported, somebody might want to go and do some  staking. In that way we might get some gold claims,\" I reasoned, while  all three listened during a lull in the work.    \"That's what we all came to Alaska for--gold claims. I want three,\"  remarked Alma with complacency, \"and besides, there is plenty of  driftwood at Golovin on the beach which we could have for nothing, and  save buying coal at three dollars a sack as we do here,\" glancing at the  scuttle near the range reproachfully, as if the poor, inanimate thing  was to blame for prices.    Little Alma was keen at a bargain. There was nothing slow about the grey  matter in her cranium. If there was buying to do, or a commodity to  sell, Alma was the one of the restaurant firm to do it, enjoying well  the bargaining, where she was seldom outwitted.    So in the intervals between meals, or at night when the day's work was  done, we discussed our plans outside the kitchen door next the sea  beach, watching the shipping in the roadstead, admiring the lovely sky  tints left by the setting sun, or gazing at the softly rolling breakers  under a silver-bowed moon.    If we had plenty of hard work, with its not altogether desirable phases,  we also enjoyed much beside the novelty. Some one we knew was always in  from the creeks, principally Anvil, to bring latest news, as well as to  collect the same, and the kitchen as well as the dining-room, was the  constant rendezvous of friends of one or all of us. Those prospecting  among the hills or on the beach at some distance from town came in often  for supplies and to visit the post-office, giving the \"Star\" a call for  hot coffee, if not a supper, before leaving. Jokes and stories flew  about over the tables, and interesting incidents were always occurring.  Good humor and good cheer flowed on every side along with the cordial  greeting, and tea and coffee, though nothing stronger in the way of  drinks was ever placed upon the tables.    In the kitchen we did not lack voluntary assistants when work pushed, or  there was what we called \"a rush.\" One young man would fill the water  buckets at a neighboring hydrant, another would bring in coal, and some  other would carry away refuse.    Happy, indeed, were the great numbers of dogs fed from the \"Star\"  kitchen. No beggar was ever turned away. No homeless and discouraged  soul, whether man or woman, sober or drunken, was allowed to leave as  forlorn as he entered. Men often sat down at the tables, who, when  filled with good food and hot drink, in a warm and comfortable room fell  asleep from the effects of previous stimulants and sank to the floor.  When this happened some strong and helpful arm assisted such a one with  friendly advice, to the street.    The two sisters were now our nearest neighbors, the third and married  one having gone with her husband to live in a new cottage of their own  in another part of the town. The eldest of the two had kindly offered me  lodging in the back part of their store building of which our restaurant  rooms were a half, and from which we were only separated by a board  partition. This was a temporary arrangement until I could find something  that suited me close at hand, as I chose to be near my work on account  of going to my room in the evening after my duties were done. The  sisters themselves still lived in their large warehouse a few feet back  from the store, and between it and the surf which rolled ceaselessly  upon the sands.    I was now more comfortably lodged than since I had landed at Nome. My  canvas cot, placed in the back of the store, vacant except for a few  rolls of carpeting, matting and oil cloth on sale by the sisters, stood  not far from the large coal heater in which fire was kept during the  day, making the room warm and dry when I came in at night. Near the  foot of my cot a good window admitted light and sunshine, and a door  opened upon a flight of six stairs into a tiny square yard before one  entered the warehouse, where lived the sisters. This latter building was  made of corrugated iron, on piles, with windows and a door in the south  end looking directly out upon the water only a few feet away, and was  fitted cosily enough for the summer, but not intended for anything  further except storage purposes.
