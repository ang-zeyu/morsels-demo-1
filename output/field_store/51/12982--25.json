The mania lasts longer than was  thought possible. The \"phenomenon\" has really become a feature of the  times. It absorbs a great share of the current literary enthusiasm--much  of which it has created, and will, it is to be feared, entirely satisfy.  Professor Pease, of the University of Vermont, in an essay upon the  subject, seeks to determine its import and value; to trace the feeling  which gives it birth to its source, and to determine as accurately as  possible the grounds of promise or of fear which it affords. \"These  interpretations,\" he says, \"vary between the widest extremes. On the one  side is heard the exulting shout of those who whirl unresistingly in the  vortex--'Does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice?'  behold the 'progress of the species' and the 'march of mind!' And, on  the other side, the contemptuous murmur of those who will be overwhelmed  rather than gyrate against their will, they know not whither--'What  meaneth this bleating of the sheep in mine ears?'\"    This mania for lectures, taken in connection with the prevailing  literary taste (of which it is in some sort an index), is regarded as  pointing, more or less directly, to a want of the human spirit--to its  cry--strong and importunate, though often stifled and but dimly felt,  for light--the light of science and of truth. Many feel this want only  as a _traditional_ need--one which their fathers before them have felt  and have taught them to feel--and _they_ are apt to be satisfied with a  traditional supply. Others ask for science because it will help them  make, or work, and perchance _become_ machines, whereby they may earn  bread: and oftentimes, says the writer, \"does this mere irritability of  the coating of the stomach pass itself off as the waking up the life of  the soul, and the sublime and pure aspirations of the spirit, for high  and ultimate truths, pure as itself.\" Then, it is the fashion to be  learned, and the fops of literature, who must \"follow the fashion,\" of  course, get wisdom as quickly and easily as possible. These are the main  features of that demand for science, which is now so clamorous. Mr.  Pease divides the lectures of the day into three classes; first those of  which the object is instruction, then those designed to amuse, and last,  those which profess to serve both these purposes; and he thinks it may  be said of all, that they have no _vital, form-giving, organific  principle_, running through them, developing properly each separate  part, and uniting them all by its own power.    In these discourses he says: \"The carpenter is the actual model; for  like him the discourser cuts and fits his timber according to rules the  grounds of which it concerns not him to understand, with little labor  beyond that of hacking and hewing--materials being ever ready at his  hand: for the world is full of books as the forest is of trees and the  market of lumber. And this is done to instruct us; to build us up  inwardly; to administer food to our intellect; to nourish our souls; to  kindle the imagination and awaken to energetic action the living but  slumbering world within. But, alas! this inner world cannot be kindled  like a smouldering fire, by a basket of chips and a puff of wind! This  inner world is a world of spirits, which feed on thoughts full of truth  and living energy. And thought alone can kindle thought: and truth alone  can waken truth: not veracity, not fact, but truth vital,            'Truth that wakes      To perish never.'    This is the bread for which the soul is pining, and such are the husks  with which its calls are answered.\"    There is in this statement of the predominant character of our popular  lectures much that is true, as we could easily show by a definite  examination of the most popular discourses to which our audiences  listen. Every one can see that their aim is, not to announce great  truths, which are essential to the well-being of society, and the  instruction of the soul, but so to shape their sentences, so to point  their paragraphs, and to give such a turn to their expressions, as to  tickle most effectually the fancy of those who hear them, and to call  down that round of applause which tells them they have made a _hit_. Now  just so far as this is the case, popular lecturing not only seeks to  supply the place of the theatre, but actually becomes theatrical; and  lacking the essential worth and dignity of the drama, assumes its tricks  and shallow vanities.    Nevertheless, the author whom we have quoted sees in this fashion signs  of promise, for it signifies the existence and the struggling toward the  light, of the absolute want of the soul--which will soon rectify the  public taste, and teach men that pleasure lies only in the life-giving  and the true.    \"In this,\" he says, \"lives an abiding ground of hope and cheerful  confidence; for it teaches us that every human heart has those depths  and living powers in it, the healthful action of which is the true life  and well-being of the soul--and in none, we hope, are they forever  dormant; and no heart, we hope, is wholly closed. Light, though in rays  feeble and scattered, may shine in upon it, and it shall awake--for it  is not dead, but sleepeth.... The feeling of wants that lie deeper and  farther inward than the sensual appetites, must be supplied or  suppressed; and hence arise a struggle and conflict between the  antagonist principles of our being. Firm peace, and healthful, quiet  energy of soul, are the fruit of victory, and of victory only.  Therefore, though attended with a 'troubled sea of noises, and hoarse  disputes,' the contest, with its hubbub and vain clamor, is the door to  quietness and clear intelligence. Pedantry and pretension, quackery and  imposture, shall, in spite of themselves, conduct to their own exposure  and extinction; for a higher sway than ours guides all affairs, causing  even the wrath of man to praise Him, and making folly itself the guide  to wisdom. Hooker characterized his own times as 'full of tongue, and  weak of brain;' and Luther said to the same effect, of the preachers and  scholars of his day: 'If they were not permitted to prate and clatter  about it, they would burst with the greatness of their art and science,  so hot and eager are they to teach.' But the noise and dust having  subsided, there is left us, of those very times, works which men will  not willingly let die. Noise and smoke causeless do not come. There is a  force at bottom which will ultimately work itself clear, and produce  good and substantial fruits. There is a force somewhere, or no foam and  dust would rise: but there is little force in the foam and dust  themselves. And the immediate instruments are _only_ instruments,  working without knowledge what they do, like puppets, dancing and  swinging their arms, while far behind resides the force that works the  wires. All wonder bestowed upon _them_ is, most certainly, foolish  wonder. But there is no ground for discouragement, or for any but good  hopes, although ignorance and pretension stand in high places, and  vainly babble concerning things beautiful and profound. This uproar  comes only from the troubling of the stream--the foam and roar will not  continue always; the smooth plain lies below, along which it shall soon  flow, quietly, but strongly, murmuring sweet music. And for the  ambitious rainbows painted in the mists above, there shall be the sweet  reflection of earth and heaven from its calm bosom.\"          OLD TIMES IN NEW-YORK.      Governor William Livingston, of New Jersey, \"poet, philosopher and  sage,\" in a letter written November 17th, 1744, gives the following  insight into life, as it then was, in New-York. He is describing a  \"party:\"    \"The feast as usual was preceded by cards, and the company so numerous  that they filled two tables; after a few games, a magnificent supper  appeared in grand order and decorum--the frolic was closed up by ten  sunburnt virgins lately come from Columbus's Newfoundland, and sundry  other female exercises; besides a play of my own invention, which I have  not room enough to describe at present; however, kissing constitutes a  great part of its entertainment.\"    In 1759, Livingston's father died, and his funeral obsequies were  performed in all the pomp and attended with all the expense customary in  colonial times. These took place in New-York. The lower apartments of  most of the stores in Broad-street, where he resided, were thrown  open--a pipe of wine was spiced--there were eight pall-bearers, and to  each was presented a pair of gloves, a mourning ring, scarf and  handkerchief, and a spoon. These services were repeated at the manor,  his country-seat, and a handkerchief and pair of black gloves presented  to each of the tenants.          ROSSINI IN THE KITCHEN.      The last accounts of Rossini, if we are to credit the pleasant stories  told of him by the Parisian wit, Louis Huart, are highly characteristic  of the great _maestro_. The following _canard_ is one of the most  _veritable_ and amusing:--    \"The newspapers announce that Rossini has shut himself up at Bologna  with the celebrated tenor Donzelli, and that they pass their days in  rehearsing a new opera, of which Rossini is finishing the score. After  the sea-serpent, I know of no story which returns more periodically than  the announcement of a new opera by Rossini. It is now fifteen years  since this pleasantry began to be invariably reproduced at the  commencement of every winter, and always with the same success. One  begins to meet in society a few Parisians who shrug their shoulders with  an air of incredulity when "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#19)"],[1,"town without much effect, while the naval gunners replied with  telling emphasis. They succeeded in dismounting the Boers' 40-pounder  which had been so comfortably posted on Pepworth's Hill.    The carriages and platforms on which the naval guns were mounted at  Ladysmith, and which proved so important a feature in promoting the  defence of the place, were specially designed by Captain Percy Scott of  the cruiser _Terrible_. In regard to this officer's resourcefulness the  _Times_ expressed an opinion that is worthy of remembrance:--    \"Captain Percy Scott, of the _Terrible_, came to the rescue, adding one  more to the numerous instances in which this country has owed to  individual resource and initiative its escape from the disasters invited  by the incompetence of the War Office. There is no need to inquire just  now into the balance of political and military considerations which  determined the policy of making a stand at Ladysmith. It is enough that  that policy was definitely adopted in ample time to allow of providing  Ladysmith with the long-range guns which its position renders peculiarly  necessary, dominated as it is by hills on three sides. Why were such  guns not provided? Why was it left to fortunate accident to furnish the  garrison at the very last moment with the means of defence? The  conclusions of German military science, as will have been noted by all  who read the interesting account of German manoeuvres which we  published yesterday, are all in favour of saving the lives of the  infantry by a very free use of artillery at long ranges. The country  around Ladysmith seems to be one that calls loudly for even a more  lavish artillery equipment than might normally suffice. Yet, in spite of  science and of common-sense, the Ladysmith garrison, occupying a  predetermined position open to artillery fire from all sides, was left  absolutely destitute of long-range guns, and none too well provided with  field-artillery. But that Captain Scott proved himself able, just in  time, to improvise out of the rough materials at hand an effective  gun-carriage, there would have been nothing to prevent the Boers from  using their big guns at half the distance they have actually had to  keep.\"    At this time British troops were withdrawn from Colenso and moved  farther south, and Boer armies continued to close round Ladysmith.  Isimbulwana Hill, lying east of Ladysmith, was taken possession of, and  a force advancing from Dewdrop, on the west of the town, moved south  towards Colenso, and there on high ground posted its guns. Yet, in spite  of this, the town showed itself to be \"all alive and kicking.\" Though  cut off from the telegraph, it sent out pigeon-posts; though engirdled  by Boers, it made sorties of the most animated description, and  literally laughed at the hint of surrender. On the 2nd, Colonel  Brocklehurst made an attack on the enemy's laagers with a force of  cavalry, mounted infantry, and mounted volunteers, surprising the  Dutchmen and driving them back with comparatively small loss, and on the  following day fighting lasted for some hours between the British  cavalry, supported by field-artillery, Imperial Light Horse, and Natal  Mounted Volunteers, and the Republicans. Many shells were pitched into  the town, and an artillery duel rampaged with such relentless vigour  that the general sensation to those who remained enclosed in the town  was as though a thunderstorm with earthquake was passing over the place.  Nothing worse happened, and the enemy for a while were driven back to  their camp and some thirty or more prisoners were taken. Major Charles  Kincaid, 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers, with nine wounded prisoners, was  exchanged by the Boers for eight of their countrymen in similar plight.  Others of them were not fit to travel. The enemy continued active,  replacing disabled guns with new ones and dragging fresh powerful  weapons to bear on the situation. On the 4th of November they announced  their annexation of Upper Tugela, and a counter-proclamation of the  nature already quoted was issued by the Governor.    A large commando of the enemy commenced the bombardment of Colenso, and  the troops forming the garrison of that place fell back on Estcourt,  where was stationed a force of considerable strength. By \"considerable  strength\" it must be understood that the force was sufficiently strong  for purposes of defence, though not for purposes of offence. As a matter  of fact, the force in Natal was not, and has not since been,  sufficiently strong for attack of a foe in such powerfully intrenched  positions. From beginning to end our military commanders on that side of  the theatre of war were sorely handicapped by the tardy recognition by  the Home Government of the gravity of the situation. But here it is now  desirable that something should be said of the early history of the  towns of Mafeking and Kimberley, which, like Ladysmith, were by this  time almost completely isolated, rails and telegraph wires having been  cut around both places respectively.    [Illustration: LADYSMITH, NATAL.

He entered the army on  February 12, 1876, and on the Afghan War breaking out two years later was  appointed aide-de-camp to his uncle, then Sir Frederick Roberts. He was  present in the engagement at Charasiah on October 6, 1879, and the  subsequent pursuit of the enemy, his services being mentioned in  despatches. A similar distinction fell to his lot in connection with the  operations around Cabul in 1879, including the investment of Sherpore. He  accompanied Lord Roberts in the famous march to Candahar, and was present  at the battle at that place, when he was again mentioned in despatches.  His services during the operations were rewarded with the medal with three  clasps and the bronze decoration. In 1881 he took part in the Mahsood  Wuzeeree Expedition, and on August 20, 1884, he received his company. He  served with the Burmese Expedition in 1886-87 as D.A.A. and Q.G. on the  Headquarters Staff, and was again mentioned in despatches and received the  Distinguished Service Order and the medal with clasp. On October 15, 1898,  A.A.G. in Bengal.    [2] Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Henry Gunning, of the 1st King's Royal  Rifles, was the eldest son of Sir George William Gunning, fifth Baronet,  of Little Horton House, Northampton, the Chairman of the Conservative  Party in Mid-Northamptonshire, by his marriage with Isabella Mary Frances  Charlotte, daughter of the late Colonel William Chester-Master, of the  Abbey, Cirencester, and was born on July 17, 1852. Educated at Eton, he  entered the army as a sub-lieutenant on March 26, 1873, and was gazetted  to the 60th Foot (now the King's Royal Rifle Corps) as a lieutenant on  September 9, 1874. He served in the Zulu War of 1879 with the third  battalion of his regiment, and was present at the action of Gingindhlovu  and the relief of Ekowe, afterwards serving as adjutant of the battalion  throughout the operations of \"Clarke's Column,\" for which he wore the  medal with clasp. He was gazetted captain in August 1883, was an adjutant  of the Auxiliary Forces (the 5th Militia Battalion of the King's Royal  Rifles) from March 1886 to March 1891, having obtained the rank of major  on June 25, 1890. In 1891-92 he took part in the war in Burma, being  engaged in the operations in the Chin Hills in command of the Baungshe  column, for which he wore a second medal with clasp. His commission as  lieutenant-colonel bore date April 16, 1898. Colonel Gunning, who was in  the Commission of the Peace for the county of Northants, married in 1880  Fanny Julia, daughter of the late Mr. Clinton George Dawkins, formerly Her  Majesty's Consul-General at Venice.    [3] Colonel John James Scott Chisholme, who was killed at Elandslaagte,  belonged to the 5th (Royal Irish) Lancers, and who was detached on special  service in South Africa, came of an old Scottish family, the Chisholmes of  Stirches, Roxburghshire, his family seat being situate at the latter  place. He was the only son of the late Mr. John Scott Chisholme (who  assumed the name of Scott in 1852 under the will of his uncle, Mr. James  Scott of Whitehaugh), by his marriage with Margaret, eldest daughter and  co-heir of the late Mr. Robert Walker of Mumrells, Stirlingshire, and was  born in 1851. He entered the army in January 1872, his first services  being with the 9th Lancers, and reached the rank of captain in March 1878.  From that year till 1880 he served with the 9th Lancers in the Afghan War,  was present at the capture of Ali Musjid, took part in the affair of Siah  Sung, where he was severely wounded, and in the operations around Cabul in  December 1879, when he was again wounded, and obtained mention in  despatches, being rewarded with the brevet of major (May 2, 1881), and the  medal with two clasps. He reached the substantive rank of major in  December 1884, and from that year till 1889 was a major of the 9th  Lancers, when he was transferred to the 5th Lancers. He was Military  Secretary to Lord Connemara when Governor of Madras from 1888 to 1891. He  reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in August 1894, and that of colonel  on August 12, 1898.    [4] Commander Egerton was a nephew of the Duke of Devonshire and of the  first Earl of Ellesmere. He was the son of the late Admiral the Hon.  Francis Egerton, M.P. for East Derbyshire, 1868-86. Commander Egerton, who  was in his thirty-first year, entered the navy seventeen years ago. He  became a lieutenant in 1891, and in 1897 he was appointed gunnery officer  in the cruiser _Powerful_, having specially qualified in gunnery.
