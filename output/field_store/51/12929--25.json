By temperamental reactionaries and  fanatics things Western have, of course, always been abhorred. But,  leaving aside this intransigeant minority, the attitude of other  categories of Orientals has varied greatly according to times and  circumstances. By liberal-minded persons Western influences were at  first hailed with cordiality and even with enthusiasm. In the opening  chapter we saw how the liberal reformers welcomed the Western concept of  progress and made it one of the bases of their projected religious  reformation. And the liberals displayed the same attitude in secular  matters. The liberal statesmen who governed Turkey during the third  quarter of the nineteenth century made earnest efforts to reform the  Ottoman State, and it was the same in other parts of the Moslem world.  An interesting example is the attempt made by General Kheir-ed-Din to  modernize Tunis. This man, a Circassian by birth, had won the confidence  of his master, the Bey, who made him vizier. In 1860 he toured Europe  and returned greatly impressed with its civilization. Convinced of  Europe's infinite superiority, he desired passionately to transplant  Western ideas and methods to Tunis. This he believed quite feasible, and  the result would, so he thought, be Tunis's rapid regeneration.  Kheir-ed-Din was not in the least a hater of the West. He merely  recognized clearly the Moslem world's peril of speedy subjection to the  West if it did not set its house rapidly in order, and he therefore  desired, in a perfectly legitimate feeling of patriotism, to press his  country along the road of progress, that it might be able to stand alone  and preserve its independence.    So greatly was the Bey impressed by Kheir-ed-Din's report that he gave  him a free hand in his reforming endeavours. For a short time  Kheir-ed-Din displayed great activity, though he encountered stubborn  opposition from reactionary officials. His work was cut short by his  untimely death, and Tunis, still unmodernized, fell twenty years later  under the power of France. Kheir-ed-Din, however, worked for posterity.  In order to rouse his compatriots to the realities of their situation he  published a remarkable book, _The Surest Means of Knowing the State of  Nations_. This book has profoundly influenced both liberals and  nationalists throughout the Near East, especially in North Africa, where  it has become the bible of Tunisian and Algerian nationalism. In his  book Kheir-ed-Din shows his co-religionists the necessity of breaking  with their attitude of blind admiration for the past and proud  indifference to everything else, and of studying what is going on in the  outer world. Europe's present prosperity is due, he asserts, not to  natural advantages or to religion, but \"to progress in the arts and  sciences, which facilitate the circulation of wealth and exploit the  treasures of the earth by an enlightened protection constantly given to  agriculture, industry, and commerce: all natural consequences of justice  and liberty--two things which, for Europeans, have become second  nature.\" In past ages the Moslem world was great and progressive,  because it was then liberal and open to progress. It declined through  bigotry and obscurantism. But it can revive by reviving the spirit of  its early days.    I have stressed the example of the Tunisian Kheir-ed-Din rather than the  better-known Turkish instances because it illustrates the general  receptivity of mid-nineteenth-century Moslem liberals to Western ideas  and their freedom from anti-Western feeling.[87] As time passed,  however, many of these erstwhile liberals, disillusioned with the West  for various reasons, notably European aggression, became the bitterest  enemies of the West, hating the very spirit of Western civilization.[88]    This anti-Western feeling has, of course, been greatly exacerbated since  the beginning of the present century. As an influential Mohammedan wrote  just before the Great War: \"The events of these last ten years and the  disasters which have stricken the Mohammedan world have awakened in its  bosom a sentiment of mutual cordiality and devotion hitherto unknown,  and a unanimous hatred against all its oppressors has been the ferment  which to-day stirs the hearts of all Moslems.\"[89] The bitter rancour  seething in many Moslem hearts shows in outbursts like the following,  from the pen of a popular Turkish writer at the close of the Balkan  Wars: \"We have been defeated, we have been shown hostility by the  outside world, because we have become too deliberative, too cultured,  too refined in our conceptions of right and wrong, of humanity and  civilization. The example of the Bulgarian army has taught us that every  soldier facing the enemy must return to the days of barbarism, must have  a thirst of blood, must be merciless in slaughtering children and women,  old and weak, must disregard others' property, life, and honour. Let us  spread blood, suffering, wrong, and mourning. Thus only may we become  the favourites of the civilized world like King Ferdinand's army.\"[90]    The Great War itself was hailed by multitudes of Moslems as a  well-merited Nemesis on Western arrogance and greed. Here is how a  leading Turkish newspaper characterized the European Powers: \"They would  not look at the evils in their own countries or elsewhere, but  interfered at the slightest incident in our borders; every day they  would gnaw at some part of our rights and our sovereignty; they would  perform vivisection on our quivering flesh and cut off great pieces of  it. And we, with a forcibly controlled spirit of rebellion in our hearts  and with clinched but powerless fists, silent and depressed, would  murmur as the fire burned within: 'Oh, that they might fall out with one  another! Oh, that they might eat one another up!' And lo! to-day they  are eating each other up, just as the Turk wished they would.\"[91]    Such anti-Western sentiments are not confined to journalists or  politicians, they are shared by all classes, from princes to peasants.  Each class has its special reasons for hating European political  control. The native princes, even when maintained upon their thrones and  confirmed in their dignities and emoluments, bitterly resent their state  of vassalage and their loss of limitless, despotic power. \"Do you know,  I can hardly buy a pen or a sword for myself without asking the Resident  for permission?\" remarked an Indian rajah bitterly. His attitude was  precisely that of Khedive Tewfik Pasha, who, in the early days of the  British occupation of Egypt, while watching a review of British troops,  said to one of his ministers: \"Do you suppose I like this? I tell you, I  never see an English sentinel in my streets without longing to jump out  of my carriage and strangle him with my own hands.\"[92] The upper  classes feel much the same as their sovereigns. They regret their former  monopoly of privilege and office. This is especially true of the  Western-educated _intelligentsia_, who believe that they should hold all  government posts and resent bitterly the reservation of high-salaried  directive positions for Europeans. Of course many intelligent liberals  realize so fully the educative effect of European control that they  acquiesce in a temporary loss of independence in order to complete their  modernization and ultimately be able to stand alone without fear of  reaction or anarchy. However, these liberals are only a small minority,  hated by their upper-class fellows as time-servers and renegades, and  sundered by an immense gulf from the ignorant masses.    At first sight we might think that the masses would, on the whole, be  favourably disposed toward European political control. Despite certain  economic disadvantages that Westernization has imposed, the masses have  unquestionably gained most by European rule. Formerly exploited  ruthlessly by both princes and upper classes, the peasants and town  workers are to-day assured peace, order, justice, and security for  their landholdings and the fruits of their toil. Now it would be a  mistake to think that the masses are insensible to all this. The fact  is, they do recognize the benefits of European rule. Nevertheless, the  new rulers, while tolerated and even respected, are never beloved.  Furthermore, as the generation which knew the old regime dies off, its  evils are forgotten, and the younger generation, taking present benefits  for granted, murmurs at the flaws in the existing order, and lends a  readier ear to native agitators extolling the glories of independence  and idealizing the \"good old times.\"    The truth of the matter is that, despite all its shortcomings, the  average Oriental hankers after the old way of life. Even when he  recognizes the good points of the new, he nevertheless yearns  irrationally for the old. \"A Moslem ruler though he oppress me and not a  _kafir_[93] though he work me weal\" is a Moslem proverb of long  standing. Every colonial administration, no matter how enlightened, runs  counter to this ineradicable aversion of Moslems for Christian rule. A  Russian administrator in Central Asia voices the sentiments of European  officials generally when he states: \"Pious Moslems cannot accommodate  themselves to the government of _Giaours_.\"[94]    Furthermore, it must be remembered that most Orientals either do not  recognize much benefit in European rule, or, even though they do  recognize considerable benefits, consider these more than offset by many  points which, in their eyes, are maddening annoyances or burdens. The  very things which we most pride ourselves on having given to the  Orient--peace, order, justice, security--are not valued by the Oriental  anywhere near as highly as we might expect. Of course he likes these  things, but he would prefer to get less of them if what he did get was  given by native rulers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#19)"],[1,"much  pleased with his prospective son-in-law and evidently determined to give  the pair a truly elegant wedding outfit. The list of the  house-furnishings which he ordered from England has been preserved, and  may be quoted as showing part of the \"setting-off\" in furniture of a  rich bride of the day. It reads thus:         \"Curtains & Vallens for a Bed with Counterpane Head Cloth and       Tester made of good yellow waterd worsted camlet with Triming well       made and Bases if it be the Fashion.

In 1646 an inquiry was made into some  losses on the wreck of the \"Angel Gabriel.\" A servant took oath that Mr.  John Coggeswell \"had a Turkywork'd Carpet in old England which he  commonly used to lay on his Parlour Table; and this Carpet was put  aboard among my Maisters goods and came safe ashore to the best of my  Remembrance.\" Another man testified that he did \"frequentlie see a  Turkey-work Carpet & heard them say it used to lay upon their Parlour  Table.\" Dornix, arras, cloth, calico, and broadcloth carpets are named.  Sewall tells of an \"Irish stitch't hanging made a carpet of.\" Samuel  Danforth gave, in 1661, a \"Convenient Carpet for the table of the  meeting house.\" In 1735, in the advertisement of the estate of Jonathan  Barnard, \"one handsome Large Carpet 9 Foot 0 inches by 6 foot 6 inches\"  was named. This was, I fancy, a floor covering. In the _Boston Gazette_  of November, 1748, \"two large Matts for floors\" were advertised--an  exceptional instance in the use of the word mat. Large floor-carpets  were advertised the following year, and in 1755 a \"Variety of List  Carpets wide & Narrow,\" and \"Scotch Carpets for Stairs.\" In 1769 came  \"Persia Carpets 3 yards Wide.\" In 1772, in the _Boston Evening Post_, \"A  very Rich Wilton Carpet 18 ft by 13\" was named. The following year  \"Painted Canvass Floor Cloth\" was named. This was doubtless the \"Oyl  Cloth for Floors and Tables\" of the year 1762. Oilcloth had been known  in England a century previously. What the \"False Carpets\" advertised on  June 7, 1762, were I do not know.    The walls of the rooms were wainscoted and painted. Gurdon Saltonstall  had on the walls of some of his state-rooms leathern hangings or  tapestries. We find wealthy Sir William Pepperel sending to England, in  1737, the draught of a chamber he was furnishing, and writing, \"Geet  mock Tapestry or paint'd Canvass lay'd in Oyls for ye same and send me.\"  In 1734 \"Paper for Rooms,\" and a little later \"Rolled Paper for Hanging  of Rooms\" were advertised in the _Boston News Letter_. \"Statues on  Paper\" were soon sold, and \"Architraves on Roll Paper\" and \"Landscape  Paper.\" These old paper-hangings were of very heavy and strong  materials, close-grained, firm and durable. The rooms of a few wealthy  men were hung with heavy tapestries. The ceilings usually exposed to  view the great summer-tree and cross rafters, sometimes rough-hewn and  still showing the marks of the woodman's axe. But little decoration was  seen overhead, even in the form of chandeliers; sometimes a candle beam  bore a score of candles, or in some fine houses, such as the Storer  mansion in Boston, great ornamental globes of glass hung from the  summer-tree.    In the first log cabins oiled paper was placed in windows. We find more  than one colonist writing to England for that semi-opaque  window-setting. Soon glass windows, framed in lead, were sent from  London and Liverpool and Bristol, ready for insertion in the walls of  houses; and at an early day sheets of glass came to Winthrop. We find,  by Sewall's time, that the houses of well-to-do folk all had \"quarrels  of glass\" set in windows.    The flight of time in New England houses was marked without doors by  sun-dials; within, by noon-marks, hour-glasses, and rarely by  clepsydras, or water-clocks.    The first mention, in New England records, of a clock is in Lechford's  note-book. He states that in 1628 Joseph Stratton had of his brother a  clock and watch, and that Joseph acknowledged this, but refused to pay  for them and was sued for payment. Hence Lawyer Lechford's interest in  the articles and mention of them. In 1640 Henry Parks, of Hartford, left  a clock by will to the church. In the inventory of Thomas Coteymore,  made in Charleston, in 1645, his clock is apprized at L1. In 1657 there  was a town-clock in Boston and a man appointed to take care of it. In  1677 E. Needham, of Lynn, left a \"striking clock, a Larum that does not  strike and a watch,\" valued at L5--this in an estate of L1,117 total.  Judge Sewall wrote, in 1687, \"Got home rather before 12 Both by my Clock  and Dial.\"    Clocks must have become rather plentiful in the early part of the  following century, for in 1707 this advertisement appeared in the  _Boston News Letter_:         \"To all gentlemen and others: There is lately arrived in Boston by       way of Pennsylvania a Clock maker. If any person or persons hath       any occasions for new Clocks or to have Old Ones turn'd into       Pendulums, or any other thing either in making or mending, they can       go to the Sign of the Clock and Dial on the South Side of the Town       House.\"    In 1712, in November, appeared in the _News Letter_ the advertisement of  a man who \"performed all sorts of New Clocks and Watch works, viz: 30  hour Clocks, Week Clocks, Month Clocks, Spring Table Clocks, Chime  Clocks, quarter Clocks, quarter Chime Clocks, Church Clocks, Terret  Clocks;\" and on April 16, 1716, this notice appeared: \"Lately come from  London. A Parcel of very Fine Clocks. They go a week and repeat the hour  when Pull'd. In Japan Cases or Wall Nutt.\"    By this time, in the inventory or \"enroulment\" of the estate of any  person of note, we always find a clock mentioned. Increase Mather left  to his son Cotton \"one Pendilum Clock.\" Soon appear Japann'd clocks and  Pullup Clocks. In the _New England Weekly Journal_ of October, 1732, the  fourth prize in the Newport lottery was announced to be a clock worth  L65. \"A Handsome new Eight day Clock which shows the Moons Age, Strikes  the Quarters on Six very Tunable Bells & is in a Good Japann'd Case in  Imitation of Tortoise Shell & Gold.\"    This advertisement of Edmund Entwisle, in the _Boston News Letter_ of  November 18, 1742, proves, I think, that they had some very handsome  clocks in those days:         \"A Fine Clock. It goes 8 or 9 days with once winding up. And       repeats the Hour it struck last when you pull it. The Dial is 13       inches on the Square & Arched with a SemiCircle on the Top round       which is a strong Plate with this Motto (Time shews the Way of       Lifes Decay) well engraved & silver'd, within the Motto Ring it       shews from behind two Semispheres the Moons Increase & Decrease by       two curious Painted Faces ornamented with Golden Stars between on a       Blue Ground, and a white Circle on the Outside divided into Days       figured at every Third, in which Divisions is shewn the Age by a       fix't Index from the Top, as they pass by the great Circle is       divided into three Concentrick Collums on the outmost of which it       shews the Minute of each Hour and the Middlemost the Hours &c. the       innermost is divided into 31 equal parts figur'd at every other on       which is shewn the Day of the Month by a Hand from the Dial Plate       as the Hour & Minute is, it also shews the Seconds as common & is       ornamented with curious Engravings in a Most Fashionable Manner.

The head is ornamented with Gilded Capitalls       Bases & Frise with New fashion'd Balls compos'd of Mohogony with       Gilt Leaves & Flowers.\"    I do not quite understand this description, and I know I could never  have told the correct time by this clock, but surely it must have been  very elegant and"]]]
