In the genus _Felis_, and in birds, each kidney  has two lobes, in the elephant four, in the otter ten, in the ox twelve  to fourteen. The human kidney in its development starts with about a  dozen lobes, and the number diminishes as the kidney grows. Thus the  permanent state of the kidney in the animals mentioned is reproduced by  the stages of its development in man (xii., p. 126).    So, too, at the second or third month the uterus of the human embryo is  bicornuate, and afterwards passes through stages comparable to the adult  and permanent uterus of rodents, ruminants, and carnivores. There is  indeed a time in the development of the human embryo when it resembles  in many of its organs the adult stage of various lower animals. It is  about this time that it possesses a tail.    We note that Serres' theory of parallelism applies, strictly speaking,  only to organs, not to organisms, although he, too, readily fell into  the error of supposing that the organisation of an embryo could be  compared as a whole with the adult organisation of an animal lower in  the scale. Thus he wrote in one of his later papers[133]--\"As our  researches have made clear, an animal high in the organic scale only  reaches this rank by passing through all the intermediate states which  separate it from the animals placed below it. Man only becomes man after  traversing transitional organisatory states which assimilate him first  to fish, then to reptiles, then to birds and mammals.\" Serres was not  altogether free from the besetting sin of the transcendentalists--hasty  generalisation.    The law of parallelism applied not only to Vertebrates but also to  Invertebrates. In a short paper[134] of 1824 Serres attempted an  explanation of the nervous system of Invertebrates. Invertebrates, he  considered, lacked the cerebrospinal axis of Vertebrates, and their  nervous system was the homologue of the sympathetic system of  Vertebrates. The relation of the invertebrate to the vertebrate nervous  system being thus fixed, can the nervous system of Invertebrates be  reduced to one plan? It does not seem possible to establish a common  plan for the adult nervous systems. But apply the principle of  parallelism, which has proved so valuable within the limits of the  vertebrate series. Taking insects as the highest class, we find that  there are three stages in the development of their nervous system; in  the first the nervous system is composed of two separate strands, in the  second the strands unite round the oesophagus, in the third they unite  also behind. Now in _Bulla aperta_, stage (1) is permanent; in _Clio_,  _Doris_, _Aplysia_, _Tritonia_, _Sepia_, _Helix_, stage (2) is  permanent, and in _Unio_ stage (3). In fact, all the varieties of the  nervous system of molluscs fall into one or other of these three  classes. \"It follows, then, that as regards their nervous system, the  Mollusca are more or less advanced larvae of insects\" (p. 380). The law  of parallelism is here applied to single organ-systems, but in later  years Serres applied it to whole organisations also, saying that the  lower Invertebrates were permanent embryos of the higher.    In the paper of 1834, already referred to, Serres pushed his  speculations further and attempted to establish the unity of type of all  animals, Vertebrates and Invertebrates alike--a favourite pastime of the  transcendentalists. It is incontestable, he admits, that adult  Invertebrates are quite different in structure from adult Vertebrates,  \"but if one regards them as what I take them to be, namely, _permanent  embryos_, and if one compares their organisation with the embryogeny of  Vertebrates, one sees the differences disappear, and from their  analogies arise a crowd of unsuspected resemblances\" (_loc. cit._, p.  247).    The last point of Serres' doctrine which calls for remark is his  interpretation of abnormalities as being often comparable to grades of  structure permanent in the lower animals. Thus the double aorta which  may occur as an abnormality in man is the normal and permanent state in  reptiles. This idea, of course, he got from Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire.  It is further developed in his \"_Theorie des formations et des  deformations organiques appliquee a l'anatomie comparee des  monstruosites_ (1832), and in his final large memoir of 1860 (see below,  p. 205).    In 1816 appeared a fine piece of work by J. C. Savigny on the homologies  of the appendages in Articulates. The standpoint was that of pure  morphology. \"I am convinced,\" he wrote, \"that when a more complete  examination has been made of the mouth of insects, properly so called,  that is to say, having six legs and two antennae, it will be found that  whatever form it affects it is always essentially composed of the same  elements.... The organ remains the same, only the function is modified  or changed--such is Nature's constant plan.\"[135] In this the influence of  Geoffroy can be traced; but the work was very free from the  exaggerations of the transcendentalists, and many of Savigny's  homologies are accepted even to-day. The first memoir dealt with the  mouth-parts of insects; the second with the anterior appendages of  Articulates generally. Savigny shows that the mouth-parts of insects can  be reduced to the type shown in Orthoptera, where there are clearly two  mandibles, two maxillae, and a lower lip formed by the fusion of two  second maxillae. All other insects have these same mouth-parts, disposed  in the same order, however much their form may have been modified in  response to new functions. He goes on to compare the anterior set of  appendages in a long series of Articulates, in _Julus_, _Scolopendra_,  _Cancer_, _Gammarus_, _Cyamus_, _Nymphon_, _Phalangium_, _Apus_,  _Caligus_, _Limulus_, and a few others. For Crustacea he established the  homologies now accepted, of the mandibles with the mandibles of insects,  of the first and second pairs of maxillae with the parts so named in  insects, and so on. He is quite clear that the maxillipedes of Crustacea  are the homologues of the feet of Hexapoda. \"Their disposition must lead  one to think that the six anterior feet of _Julus_, that is to say, all  the feet of the Hexapoda, are here transformed into jaws\" (_loc. cit._,  p. 48). In _Scolopendra_ also there is a similar transformation of two  pairs of legs into auxiliary jaws. In _Gammarus_, where there is only  the first pair of maxillipedes, the other two pairs have become  \"retransformed\" into feet. We find him supporting his comparison of the  three anterior pairs of legs in _Julus_ to the three pairs of legs in  insects by an argument drawn from embryology; for only the first three  pairs of feet are present in _Julus_ at birth (Degeer), \"an observation,  which, together with their position, should cause them to be considered  as the representatives of the six thoracic feet of Hexapoda\" (p. 44).    His comparison of the Arachnid appendages with those of insects and  Crustacea is very curious. As his starting-point he takes _Cyamus_,  which has antennae (two pairs) and mouth parts (four pairs) as in many  Crustacea, and then seven pairs of legs; he compares with it _Nymphon_,  which has in all seven pairs of appendages. These appendages he  homologises with the seven pairs of legs of _Cyamus_, so that the first  appendage in _Nymphon_ corresponds to the seventh appendage of _Cyamus_.  This homology is extended to all Arachnids; their first two pairs of  appendages, however they may be modified as \"false\" mandibles and  \"false\" maxillae, really correspond to the second and third maxillipedes  in Crustacea, and to the second and third pairs of feet in insects. It  is interesting to note that he treats _Limulus_ as an Arachnid, pointing  out that there is as much difference between _Apus_ and _Limulus_ as  between _Cancer_ and _Phalangium_. He describes the \"gnathobases\" in  _Phalangium_ and _Limulus_. We may note that he had just an inkling of  the modern doctrine that all the appendages of Articulates consist of a  basal joint bearing an inner and an outer terminal piece, for he  observes that the \"cirri\" of the maxillipedes of Crustacea give the  appendage the same bifid appearance as the appendages of the abdomen and  the thoracic legs of _Mysis_ (p. 50).    V. Audouin, in his memoir, _Recherches anatomiques sur le thorax des  animaux articules_,[135] applied the principle of the unity of plan and  composition to the exoskeleton of insects, Crustaceans, and Arachnids.  His guiding ideas were, \"(1) that the skeleton of articulated animals is  formed of a definite number of pieces, which are either distinct or  intimately fused with one another; (2) that in many cases, some pieces  diminish or altogether disappear, while others reach an excessive  development; (3) that the increase of one piece seems to exert on the  neighbouring pieces a kind of influence which explains all the  differences one finds between the individuals of each order, family and  genus\" (Sep. copy, p. 16). Geoffroy had already stated, without proof,  that the parts of the Arthropod's skeleton, however they might change in  shape and size, remained faithful to the principle of connections, at  least at their points of insertion.[137] Audouin gave the detailed  demonstration of this by his accurate and minute determination of the  pieces of the arthropod skeleton. He recognised that the body of  Arthropods was made up of a series of similar rings, and that even the  compact head of insects consisted of fused segments. In each segment  Audouin distinguished a fixed number of hard chitinous parts, the dorsal  tergum, the ventral sternum, the lateral \"flanc\" of three pieces, all to  be recognised by their positions relative to one another. Many of the  names which he proposed are still in use; it was he who introduced the  terms prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax, for the three segments"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#19)"],[1,"expressed this hope in her own practical words to Lydia Mott:  \"Institutions, among them marriage, are justly chargeable with many  social and individual ills, but after all, the whole man or woman will  rise above them. I am sure my 'true woman' will never be crushed or  dwarfed by them. Woman must take to her soul a purpose and then make  circumstances conform to this purpose, instead of forever singing the  refrain, 'if and if and if.'\"[107]           *       *       *       *       *    Late in 1858, Susan received a letter from Wendell Phillips which put  new life into all her efforts for women. He wrote her that an  anonymous donor had given him $5,000 for the woman's rights cause and  that he, Lucy Stone, and Susan had been named trustees to spend it  wisely and effectively.    The man who felt that the woman's rights cause was important enough to  rate a gift of that size proved to be wealthy Francis Jackson of  Boston, in whose home Susan had visited a few years before with Lucy  and Antoinette. Jubilant over the prospects, she at once began to make  plans. She wanted to use all of the fund for lectures, conventions,  tracts, and newspaper articles; Lucy thought part of the money should  be spent to prove unconstitutional the law which taxed women without  representation and Antoinette was eager for a share to establish a  church in which she could preach woman's rights with the Gospel.    Both Wendell Phillips and Lucy Stone agreed that Susan should have  $1,500 for the intensive campaign she had planned for New York, and  for once in her life she started off without a financial worry, with  money in hand to pay her speakers. She held meetings in all of the  principal towns of the state, making them at least partially pay for  themselves. Her lecturers each received $12 a week and she kept a  like amount for herself, for planning the tour, organizing the  meetings, and delivering her new lecture, \"The True Woman.\"    \"I am having fine audiences of thinking men and women,\" she wrote Mary  Hallowell. \"Oh, if we could but make our meetings ring like those of  the antislavery people, wouldn't the world hear us? But to do that we  must have souls baptized into the work and consecrated to it.\"[108]    Some souls were deeply stirred by the woman's rights gospel. One of  these was the wealthy Boston merchant, Charles F. Hovey, who in his  will left $50,000 in trust to Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd  Garrison, Parker Pillsbury, Abby Kelley Foster, and others, to be  spent for the \"promotion of the antislavery cause and other reforms,\"  among them woman's rights, and not less than $8,000 a year to be spent  to promote these reforms. With all this financial help available,  Susan expected great things to happen.           *       *       *       *       *    During the winter of 1860 while the legislature was in session, Susan  spent six weeks in Albany with Lydia Mott, and day after day she  climbed the long hill to the capitol to interview legislators on  amendments to the married women's property laws. When these amendments  were passed by the Senate, Assemblyman Anson Bingham urged her to  bring their mutual friend, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, to Albany to speak  before his committee to assure passage by the Assembly.    Once again Susan hurried to Seneca Falls, and unpacking her little  portmanteau stuffed with papers and statistics, discussed the subject  with Mrs. Stanton in front of the open fire late into the night. Then  the next morning while Mrs. Stanton shut herself up in the quietest  room in the house to write her speech, Susan gave the children their  breakfast, sent the older ones off to school, watched over the babies,  prepared the desserts, and made herself generally useful. By this time  the children regarded her affectionately as \"Aunt Thusan,\" and they  knew they must obey her, for she was a stern disciplinarian whom even  the mischievous Stanton boys dared not defy.    These visits of Susan's were happy, satisfying times for both these  young women. A few days' respite from travel in a well-run home with  a friend she admired did wonders for Susan, giving her perspective on  the work she had already done and courage to tackle new problems,  while for Mrs. Stanton this short period of stimulating companionship  and freedom from household cares was a godsend. \"Miss Anthony\" had  long ago become Susan to Elizabeth, but Susan all through her life  called her very best friend \"Mrs. Stanton,\" playfully to be sure, but  with a remnant of that formality which it was hard for her to cast  off.    The speech was soon finished. Mrs. Stanton's imagination, fired by her  sympathetic understanding of women's problems, had turned Susan's cold  hard facts into moving prose, while Susan, the best of critics,  detected every weak argument or faltering phrase. They both felt they  had achieved a masterpiece.    Mrs. Stanton delivered this address before a joint session of the New  York legislature in March 1860. Susan beamed with pride as she watched  the large audience crowd even the galleries and heard the long loud  applause for the speech which she was convinced could not have been  surpassed by any man in the United States.    The next day the Assembly passed the Married Women's Property Bill,  and when shortly it was signed by the governor, Susan and Mrs. Stanton  scored their first big victory, winning a legal revolution for the  women of New York State. This new law was a challenge to women  everywhere. Under it a married woman had the right to hold property,  real and personal, without the interference of her husband, the right  to carry on any trade or perform any service on her own account and to  collect and use her own earnings; a married woman might now buy, sell,  and make contracts, and if her husband had abandoned her or was  insane, a convict, or a habitual drunkard, his consent was  unnecessary; a married woman might sue and be sued, she was the joint  guardian with her husband of her children, and on the decease of her  husband the wife had the same rights that her husband would have at  her death.    Susan did not then realize the full significance of what she had  accomplished--that she had unleashed a new movement for freedom which  would be the means of strengthening the democratic government of her  country.

Mary Hallowell, a liberal Rochester Quaker,  always interested in Susan B. Anthony and her work.          THE ZEALOT      With a spirit of confidence inspired by her victory in New York State,  Susan looked forward to the tenth national woman's rights convention  in New York City in May 1860. At this convention she reported progress  everywhere. Four thousand dollars from the Jackson and Hovey funds had  been spent in the successful New York campaign, and similar work was  scheduled for Ohio. In Kansas, women had won from the constitutional  convention equal rights and privileges in state-controlled schools and  in the management of the public schools, including the right to vote  for members of school boards; mothers had been granted equal rights  with fathers in the control and custody of their children, and married  women had been given property rights. In Indiana, Maine, Missouri, and  Ohio, married women could now control their own earnings.    \"Each year we hail with pleasure,\" she continued, \"new accessions to  our faith. Brave men and true from the higher walks of literature and  art, from the bar, the bench, the pulpit, and legislative halls are  now ready to help woman wherever she claims to stand.\" She was  thinking of the aid given her by Andrew J. Colvin and Anson Bingham of  the New York legislature, of the young journalist, George William  Curtis, just recently speaking for women, of Samuel Longfellow at his  first woman's rights convention, and of the popular Henry Ward Beecher  who, just a few months before, had delivered his great woman's rights  speech, thereby identifying himself irrevocably with the cause. She  announced with great satisfaction the news, which the papers had  carried a few days before, that Matthew Vassar of Poughkeepsie had set  aside $400,000 to found a college for women equal in all respects to  Harvard and Yale.[109]    Progress and good feeling were in the air, and the speakers were not  heckled as in past years by the rowdies who had made it a practice to  follow abolitionists into woman's rights meetings to bait them. Into  this atmosphere of good will and rejoicing, Susan and Elizabeth  Stanton now injected a more serious note, bringing before the  convention the controversial question of marriage and divorce which  heretofore had been handled with kid gloves at all woman's rights  meetings, but which they sincerely believed demanded solution.           *       *     "]]]
