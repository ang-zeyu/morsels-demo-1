The escape-pipe was  led aft into the wheel-house, so as to deaden the noise; and hose  was attached to the boilers ready to scald any Confederates that  tried to board. Then, through the heart of a terrific thunderstorm,  and amid a furious cannonade, the _Carondelet_ ran the desperate  gauntlet at full speed and arrived at New Madrid by midnight.    The Confederates were now cut off both above and below; for the  position of Island Number Ten was at the lower point of a V-shaped  bend in the Mississippi, with Federal forces at the two upper points.  But the Federal troops could not close on the Confederates without  crossing over to the east bank; and their transports could not run  the gauntlet like the ironclads. So the Engineer Regiment of the West  cut out a water road connecting the two upper points of the V. This  admirable feat of emergency field engineering was effected by sawing  through three miles of heavy timber to the nearest bayou, whence a  channel was cleared down to New Madrid. Then the transports went  through in perfect safety and took Pope's advanced guard aboard. The  ironclad _Pittsburg_ had come down, through another thunderstorm,  this same morning of the seventh; and when the island garrison  saw their position completely cut off they surrendered to Foote.  Next day Pope's men cut off the greater part of the Confederates  on the mainland. Thus fell the last point near Johnston's original  line along the southern borders of Missouri and Kentucky.    Just before it fell Johnston made a desperate counterattack from  his new line at Corinth, in northwest Mississippi, against Grant's  encroaching force at Shiloh, fifteen miles northeast, on the Tennessee  River.    Writing \"A. S. Johnston, 3d April, 62, _en avant_\" on his pocket  map of Tennessee, the Confederate leader, anguished by the bitter  criticism with which his unavoidable retreat had been assailed, cast  the die for an immediate attack on Grant before slow Halleck reinforced  or ready Buell joined him. Johnston's lieutenants, Beauregard and  Bragg, had obtained ten days for reorganization; and their commands  were as ready as raw forces could be made in an extreme emergency.  They hoped to be joined by Van Dorn, whose beaten army was working  east from Pea Ridge. But on the second they heard that Buell was  approaching Grant from Nashville; and on the third Johnston's advanced  guard began to move off. Van Dorn arrived too late.    The march, which it was hoped to complete on the fourth, was not  completed till the fifth. The roads were ankle-deep in clinging  mud, the country densely wooded and full of bogs and marshes. The  forty thousand men were not yet seasoned; and, though full of  enthusiasm, they neither knew nor had time to learn march discipline.  Moreover, Johnston allowed his own proper plan of attacking in  columns of corps to be changed by Beauregard into a three-line  attack, each line being formed by one complete corps. This meant  certain and perhaps disastrous confusion. For in an attack by columns  of corps the firing line would always be reinforced by successive  lines of the same corps; while attacking by lines of corps meant  that the leading corps would first be mixed up with the second,  and then both with the third.    In the meantime Grant was busier with his own pressing problems  of organization for an advance than with any idea of resisting  attack. He lacked the prevision of Winfield Scott and Lee, both of  whom expected from the first that the war would last for years. His  own expectation up to this had been that the South would collapse  after the first smashing blow, and that its western armies were  now about to be dealt such a blow. He was not unmindful of all  precautions; for he knew the Confederates were stirring on his  front. Yet he went downstream to Savannah without making sure that  his army was really safe at Shiloh.    Pittsburg Landing was at the base of the Shiloh position. But the  point at which, by the original orders, Buell was to join was Savannah,  nine miles north along the Tennessee. So Grant had to keep in touch  with both. He had not ignored the advantage of entrenching. But  the best line for entrenching was too far from good water; and  he thought he chose the lesser of two evils when he devoted the  time that might have been used for digging to drilling instead. His  army was raw as an army; many of the men were still rawer recruits;  and, as usual, the recruiting authorities had sent him several  brand-new battalions, which knew nothing at all, instead of sending  the same men as reinforcements to older battalions that could \"learn  'em how.\" Grant's total effectives at first were only thirty-three  thousand. This made the odds five to four in favor of Johnston's  attack. But the rejoining of Lew Wallace's division, the great  reinforcement by Buell's troops, and the two ironclad gunboats  on the river, raised Grant's final effective grand total to sixty  thousand. The combined grand totals therefore reached a hundred  thousand--double the totals at Donelson and far exceeding those  at Bull Run.    After a horrible week of cold and wet the sun set clear and calm  on Saturday, the eve of battle. The woods were alive with forty  thousand Confederates all ready for their supreme attack on the  thirty-three thousand Federals on their immediate four-mile front.  Grant's front ran, facing south, between Owl and Lick Creeks, two  tributaries that joined the Tennessee on either side of Pittsburg  Landing. Buell's advance division, under Nelson, was just across the  Tennessee. But Grant was in no hurry to get it over. His reassuring  wire that night to Halleck said: \"The main force of the enemy is at  Corinth. I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack (general  one) being made upon us.\" But the skirmishing farther south on Friday  had warned Grant, as well as Sherman and the vigilant Prentiss,  that Johnston might be trying a reconnaissance in force--the very  thing that Beauregard wished the Confederates to do.    Long before the beautiful dawn of Sunday, the fateful sixth of  April, Prentiss had thrown out from the center a battalion which  presently met and drove in the vanguard of the first Confederate  line of assault. The Confederate center soon came up, overwhelmed  this advanced battalion, and burst like a storm on the whole of  Prentiss's division. Then, above the swelling roar of multitudinous  musketry, rose the thunder of the first big guns. \"Note the hour,  please, gentlemen,\" said Johnston; and a member of his staff wrote  down: \"5:14 A.M.\"    Johnston's admirable plan was, first, to drive Grant's left clear  of Lick Creek, then drive it clear of Pittsburg Landing, where the  two Federal ironclads were guarding the ferry. This, combined with  a determined general assault on the rest of Grant's line, would huddle  the retreating Federals into the cramped angle between Owl Creek and  the Tennessee and force them to surrender. But there were three  great obstacles to this: Sherman on the right, the \"Hornet's Nest\"  in the center, and the gunboats at the Landing. Worse still for the  Confederates, Buell was now too close at hand. Three days earlier  Johnston had wired from Corinth to the Government at Richmond:  \"Hope engagement before Buell can form junction.\" But the troubles  of the march had lost him one whole priceless day.    The Confederate attack was splendidly gallant and at first pushed  home regardless of loss. The ground was confusing to both sides:  a bewilderment of ups and downs, of underbrush, woods, fields,  and clumps of trees, criss-cross paths, small creeks, ravines,  and swamps, without a single commanding height or any outstanding  features except the two big creeks, the river, and the Pittsburg  Landing.    At the first signs of a big battle Grant hurried to the field,  first sending a note to Buell, whom he was to have met at Savannah,  then touching at Crump's Landing on the way, to see Lew Wallace  and make sure whether this, and not the Pittsburg Landing, was the  point of attack. Arrived on the field of Shiloh, calm and determined  as ever, he was reassured by finding how well Sherman was holding  his raw troops in hand at the extremely important point of Shiloh  itself, next to Owl Creek.    But elsewhere the prospect was not encouraging, though the men  got under arms very fast and most of them fought very well. The  eager gray lines kept pressing on like the rising tide of an angry  sea, dashing in fury against all obstructing fronts and swirling  round the disconnecting flanks. The blue lines, for the most part,  resisted till the swift gray tide threatened to cut them off. Half  of Prentiss's remaining men were in fact cut off that afternoon and  forced to surrender with their chief, whose conduct, like their  own, was worthy of all praise. Back and still back the blue lines  went before the encroaching gray, each losing heavily by sheer hard  fighting at the front and streams of stragglers running towards  the rear.    Sherman, like others, gave ground, but still held his men together,  except for the stragglers he could not control. In the center C.  F. Smith's division, with Hurlbut's in support, and all that was  left of Prentiss's, defended themselves so desperately that their  enemies called their position the Hornet's Nest. Here the fight  swayed back and forth for hours, with ghastly losses on both sides.  C. F. Smith himself was on his deathbed at Savannah. But he heard  the roar of battle. His excellent successor, W. H. L. Wallace,  was killed; and battalions, brigades, and even divisions, soon  became inextricably mixed together. There was now the same confusion  on the Confederate side, where Johnston was wounded by a bullet  from the Hornet's Nest. It was not in itself a mortal wound. But,  knowing how vital this point was, he went "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#19)"],[1,"the whole object of those people in       espousing the cause of the Transvaal is to prevent an open       rupture between that country and the British Government. They       loathe, very naturally and rightly, the idea of war, and they       think that, if they can only impress upon the British Government       that in case of war with the Transvaal it would have a great       number of its own subjects at least in sympathy against it, that       is a way to prevent such a calamity.         \"But in this they are totally wrong, for this policy rests on the       assumption that Great Britain has some occult design on the       independence of the Transvaal--that independence which it has       itself given--and that it is seeking causes of quarrel in order       to take that independence away. But that assumption is the exact       opposite of the truth. So far from seeking causes of quarrel, it       is the constant desire of the British Government to avoid causes       of quarrel, and not to take up lightly the complaints (and they       are numerous) which reach it from British subjects within the       Transvaal, for the very reason that it wishes to avoid even the       semblance of interference in the internal affairs of that       country, and, as regards its external relations, to insist only       on that minimum of control which it has always distinctly       reserved, and has reserved, I may add, solely in the interests of       the future tranquillity of South Africa. That is Great Britain's       moderate attitude, and she cannot be frightened out of it. It is       not any aggressiveness on the part of Her Majesty's Government       which now keeps up the spirit of unrest in South Africa. Not at       all. It is that unprogressiveness--I will not say the       retrogressiveness--of the Government of the Transvaal and its       deep suspicion of the intentions of Great Britain which makes it       devote its attention to imaginary external dangers, when every       impartial observer can see perfectly well that the real dangers       which threaten it are internal.    [Sidenote: Milner's appeal to the Dutch.]         \"Now, I wish to be perfectly fair. Therefore, let me say that       this suspicion, though absolutely groundless, is not, after all       that has happened, altogether unnatural. I accept the situation       that at the present moment any advice that I could tender, or       that any of your British fellow-citizens could tender in that       quarter, though it was the best advice in the world, would be       instantly rejected because it was British. But the same does not       apply to the Dutch citizens of this colony, and especially to       those who have gone so far in the expression of their sympathy       for the Transvaal as to expose themselves to these charges of       disloyalty to their own flag. Their good-will at least cannot be       suspected across the border; and if all they desire--and I       believe it is what they desire--is to preserve the South African       Republic, and to promote good relations between it and the       British Colonies and Government, then let them use all their       influence, which is bound to be great, not in confirming the       Transvaal in unjustified suspicions, not in encouraging its       Government in obstinate resistance to all reform, but in inducing       it gradually to assimilate its institutions, and, what is even       more important than institutions, the temper and spirit of its       administration, to those of the free communities of South Africa,       such as this Colony or the Orange Free State. That is the       direction in which a peaceful way out of these inveterate       troubles, which have now plagued this country for more than       thirty years, is to be found.\"[36]             [Footnote 36: _Cape Times_, March 4th, 1898.]    Here was a bolt from the blue! All South Africa stood to attention. No  such authoritative and inspiring utterance had come from the High  Commissioners for South Africa since Frere had been recalled, now  eighteen years ago. The Afrikander nationalists saw that their action  and policy were exposed to the scrutiny of a penetrating intellect,  and grew uneasy.    The position which Lord Milner had taken up was impregnable. What is  the good of your loyalty, he said in effect to the Cape Dutch, if you  refuse to help us in the one thing needful? And this the one thing of  all others the justice of which you Afrikanders should feel--that the  Transvaal should \"assimilate its institutions ... and the tone and  temper of its administration, to those of the free communities of  South Africa such as this Colony and the Orange Free State.\"    The impact of these words was tremendous. The weight behind them was  the weight of inevitable truth.    A week later Mr. J. X. Merriman wrote to President Steyn to beg him to  urge President Krueger to be careful. Under date March 11th, 1898, he  says:         \"You will, no doubt, have seen both Sir Alfred Milner's speech at       Graaf Reinet and the reported interview with Mr. Rhodes in _The       Cape Times_. Through both there runs a note of thinly veiled       hostility to the Transvaal and the uneasy menace of trouble       ahead....         \"Yet one cannot conceal the fact that the greatest danger to the       future lies in the attitude of President Krueger and his vain hope       of building up a State on a foundation of a narrow, unenlightened       minority, and his obstinate rejection of all prospect of using       the materials which lie ready to his hand to establish a true       Republic on a broad Liberal basis. The report of recent       discussions in the Volksraad on his finances and their       mismanagement fill one with apprehension. Such a state of affairs       cannot last. It must break down from inherent rottenness, and it       will be well if the fall does not sweep away the freedom of all       of us.         \"I write in no hostility to republics; my own feelings are all in       the opposite direction.... Humanly speaking, the advice and       good-will of the Free State is the only thing that stands between       the South African Republic and a catastrophe.\"[37]             [Footnote 37: Cd. 369.]    [Sidenote: Sprigg and the Bond.]    Still more striking and salutary was the effect produced upon the  British population in the Cape Colony. All who were not utterly abased  by the yoke of Bond domination stood upright. Those whose spirit had  been cowed by the odium of the Raid took heart. Never had the  essential morality of England's dealings with the Dutch been  vindicated more triumphantly. The moral right of the Power which had  done justice to the Dutch in its own borders to require the Dutch to  do justice to the British within the borders of the Republic was  unassailable. We have noticed before how in the year 1897 the  different sections of the British population were manifesting a  tendency to draw closer together. After the Graaf Reinet speech this  movement rapidly developed into a general determination to challenge  the long domination of the Bond. It had been recognised for some time  past that the recent and considerable growth of the urban population  of the Colony, which was mainly British, had not been accompanied by  any corresponding increase in the number of its parliamentary  representatives. In February (1898), the anomalous condition of the  Cape electoral system was brought before the Ministry. The  indignation caused by the dismissal of Chief Justice Kotze, and the  growing evidence of President Krueger's determination to ride  rough-shod over the British population in the Transvaal, contributed  to unite the Colonial British of all sections, with the exception of  the one or two men who were wholly identified with the Bond, in the  common aim of obtaining a fair representation for the chief centres of  British population in the Cape Colony; and the practically solid  British party thus formed adopted the title of \"Progressives.\" The  Ministry knew, of course, that any such measure would be displeasing  to Mr. Hofmeyr; but Sir Gordon Sprigg, being now assured of the almost  united support of the British members in the Colonial Parliament,  resolved to bring forward a Redistribution Bill. The draft Bill was  approved by the Executive Council on May 13th, and Dr. Te Water, Mr.  Hofmeyr's representative in the Ministry, thereupon resigned.[38]             [Footnote 38: He was succeeded in the Colonial Secretaryship           by Dr. Smartt, a former member of the Bond, but now a           Progressive, and at the same time Sir Thomas Upington, who           had resigned from ill-health, was succeeded by Mr. T.           Lynedoch Graham, as Attorney-General.]    [Sidenote: Redistribution.]    Sir Gordon Sprigg had now done a thing unprecedented in the  parliamentary history of the Cape Colony in the last fifteen years. He  had defied the Bond. He knew that the Bond was quite able to turn his  Ministry out of Office. But he had made up his mind, in this event, to  throw in his lot with the Progressive party, of which Mr. Rhodes was  the actual chief. Mr. Hofmeyr did not leave him long in doubt. On the  resignation of Dr. Te Water all the Bond artillery was at once turned  on to the Ministry. On May 31st Mr. Schreiner gave notice of a vote of  \"no confidence.\" It was put off until June 13th, and in the meantime  the second reading of the Redistribution Bill was met by the \"previous  question\" moved by Mr. Theron, the Chairman of the Provincial Council  of the Bond. No attempt was made, either in Parliament or in the  Press, to conceal the fact that, under the question of redistribution,  wider and more momentous issues were at stake. The counts in the  Bond's indictment of the Ministry, as set out in _Ons Land_, were (1)  its Imperialist tendencies as evidenced by the proposed gift of a  warship to"]]]
