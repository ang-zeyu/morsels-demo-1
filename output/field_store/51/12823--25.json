And, if I remember aright, they met  with some rather exciting adventures among these Makolo, didn't they?\"    \"Rather!\" assented Grosvenor.  \"Were taken prisoners, or something of  that sort, and only escaped by the skin of their teeth.\"    \"That's it,\" agreed Dick.  \"Yes; the man who was then king wanted to  steal their airship, didn't he?\"    \"He did--and got banished for his pains,\" answered Grosvenor.  \"But that  was not the end of the story.  He--the king, I mean--returned from his  banishment, killed the king who was reigning in his stead, and--yes, was  found practising his old dodges of cruelty and murder when the `Spirits'  paid a second visit to his country.\"    \"Precisely,\" agreed Dick.  \"But that part of the story was given in a  second book recounting the further voyagings of the wonderful _Flying-  Fish_--that was the name of the airship, you will remember.  By Jove!  How vividly those yarns recur to one's memory when anything special--  like this adventure of ours--occurs to recall them.  Do you know, Phil,  it now seems to me that, quite unconsciously to ourselves, those two  books have had a distinct influence upon us in undertaking and carrying  through this journey?\"    \"Possibly,\" agreed Grosvenor; \"though I am obliged to admit that I have  been, and am still, quite unconscious of it.  The point that is of real  importance to us is this.  Had the narratives in those two books the  slightest foundation of fact?  Because, if so, our recollection of them  might stand us in good stead should difficulties arise between us and  these people.  Take, for example, the matter of the four Spirits of the  Winds.  If we were to judiciously exhibit some knowledge of them and  their doings, this king might be inclined to be a great deal more  complaisant than he otherwise would be.  Don't you think so?\"    \"Perhaps,\" conceded Dick; \"it is impossible to say.  But what knowledge  do we possess, or can we exhibit?  Absolutely none, except what we can  remember through the perusal of those two books.  And, for my own part,  I am inclined to believe that the alleged adventures of the four persons  therein referred to were purely fictitious, or at least had no more than  the slenderest connection with actual fact.\"    \"Yet,\" contended Grosvenor, \"it is remarkable, to say the least of it,  that in our very first communication with these Makolo--which, now I  come to think of it, was the actual name of the nation given in those  books--the four Spirits of the Winds should be mentioned.  Isn't it?\"    \"Yes, it certainly is,\" agreed Dick, somewhat reluctantly.  \"And of  course,\" he continued, \"if it should happen that those two yarns are a  record of actual occurrences presented in the guise of fiction, it will  not be by any means the first time that such a thing has occurred.  Anyhow,\" he concluded, \"I do not see that we can possibly do any harm by  acting, as you suggest, upon the assumption that the yarns, however  extravagant they may have appeared to us when we read them, are records  of actual fact, and using our recollection of them in any manner that  may seem advantageous to us.  Is that agreed?\"    \"Yes, certainly,\" assented Grosvenor.  \"We can but try it, and see how  it works.  And now, to change the subject, what say you about  outspanning?  This seems to be a good spot, eh?\"    During the foregoing conversation the two speakers had been walking on  ahead of the wagon, with their rifles in the hollow of their arms, the  dogs and Leo, the lion cub, trotting amicably at their heels.  They had  arrived at a spot about a mile from the village, and were now traversing  an open \"flat\" with plenty of grass, close to the margin of a small  stream.  As Grosvenor had suggested, it was an excellent spot upon which  to outspan, for there were grass and water for the cattle, and it was  sufficiently far away from the village to prevent any of those  annoyances that a nearer approach might have subjected them to; they  therefore halted, and when the wagon came up the order to outspan was  given.  A few minutes later, while Jantje and 'Nkuku were superintending  the watering of the oxen, some half-dozen women, carrying baskets poised  upon their heads, were seen approaching from the village.  When,  somewhat later, these women arrived at the wagon, the leader of them  announced that the contents of the baskets, consisting of green mealie  cobs, sugar cane, eggs, sweet potatoes, half a dozen shockingly skinny  chickens, milk, and _joala_ (a kind of native beer) were a present from  the headman of the village to the strangers.  (Six months earlier the  travellers would have laughed incredulously at the idea of liquids being  conveyed in baskets; but now they took it quite as a matter of course,  for they had by this time grown quite familiar with the native basket,  so exquisitely woven out of grass as to be quite impervious to leakage).  They accepted the gift with a few words--but not too many--of thanks,  and then, desirous of creating a good impression upon the Makolo as  early as might be, they directed the women to wait, and, going to the  wagon, took from their store of \"notions\" a few yards of gaudily printed  cotton stuff, two or three yards of brass wire, half a dozen empty two-  ounce tobacco tins decorated with gilt and coloured lettering, in the  style familiar to all devotees of the weed, a small wooden box  containing about a pint of mixed beads, and to each of the smiling and  expectant basket-bearers a special present for herself, consisting of a  necklet of large particoloured beads, the remaining gifts being of  course for the headman in return for his present.  The necklets Dick and  Grosvenor personally clasped round the shapely, bronze-tinted throats of  the recipients, to the intense delight of the latter, and then the  damsels took their departure, smiling to such an extent as to display  every tooth in their heads.  Presently, when they were a few yards from  the wagon, they burst into song, the burden of their lay being the  magnificent generosity, enormous wealth, and splendid personality of the  visitors.    About an hour before sunset that same day another party made its  appearance, approaching from the village.  On this occasion it consisted  of men only, some twenty in number, which, upon their arrival at the  wagon, proved to be the headman of the village and his retinue, all  unarmed.    The party halted at a distance of some ten paces from the spot where  Dick and Grosvenor sat before their open tent, and as they did so, with  the precision of trained soldiers, every man's right hand was flung  aloft, and in deep, sonorous tones the salute was given:    \"_Bietu_!\"    Then the headman stepped forward and said, Mafuta standing by to act as  interpreter:    \"I, Insimbi, headman of the village of M'gama, in the country of the  Makolo, bear the greetings of the great King Lobelalatutu to the unknown  white men who have crossed the Great Water to visit him, to offer him  gifts, and to request his permission to visit the ruins of the great  city that are situate near the king's village.  He bids you welcome to  the country of the Makolo, and his word is that you are to be conducted  forthwith in all honour to his presence.  You are his guests, to be  treated by all men as such, and by them to be supplied with all things  necessary to your comfort and wellbeing.  Your oxen are poor in  condition and few in number, therefore shall they be cared for here  until they are again fit for work; meanwhile a fresh team shall be  supplied from the herd belonging to this village for the conveyance of  your wagon to the ruins you desire to visit.  And if there be any other  thing that you desire, my orders are to furnish it to you.  I have said.  Is it well, O white men?\"    \"It is very well, O Insimbi,\" answered Grosvenor.  \"It is well for the  Makolo and for your king that he keeps fresh in his memory the commands  laid upon him by the four Spirits of the Winds, and we are satisfied.  When can we be supplied with the fresh team of oxen?\"    \"At sunrise to-morrow shall the herd be driven hither, when my lords  shall choose for themselves as many as they will,\" answered the headman.    \"Let it be so,\" answered Grosvenor; \"for to-morrow at sunrise will we  resume our journey to the king's village and the ruins.  By the way, ask  him, Mafuta, how far the ruins are from here.\"    \"With a full team of fourteen fresh oxen it may be done in seven days,\"  Mafuta translated Insimbi's answer to the question.    \"Seven days!\" ejaculated Grosvenor, glancing in astonishment at Dick.  \"Then how the dickens has this fellow Insimbi contrived in the course of  a single day to communicate with the king and get a reply from him?\"    \"Why, easily enough,\" answered Dick.  \"Don't you remember the wonderful  system of voice-telegraphy mentioned in those two books that we were  discussing to-day?  That, of course, is how it has been accomplished.  And, now that I come to think of it, we had an illustration of that  system this morning when those two boys ran to the top of yonder hill  and started shouting in that queer, high-pitched tone of voice.  They  were telegraphing to the king the news of our arrival without a doubt.\"    \"Yes,\" assented Grosvenor, a little doubtfully, \"I suppose that was it.  But seven days' trek with fresh oxen!  That means a hundred and forty  miles, or thereabout--it is wonderful!\"    \"You are right; it is,\" agreed Dick; \"but not more wonderful, to my  mind, than that we, destined, as one may say, to make this trip  together, should have both been fortunate enough to stumble across and  read those two books, which I am now beginning to understand were  records of sober"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#19)"],[1,"that none of them were on any account to leave the shadow  of the verandah.  But this man had a very excellent excuse for his  breach of the rules, for the moment that he saw me he first took off his  hat and waved it to attract my attention, and then flourished it in the  direction of the look-out tree, glancing toward which I caught sight of  the fluttering fragment of scarlet bunting which was the prearranged  signal that a slaver had entered the lagoon and was approaching the  factory!  A moment later the look-out himself, having descended the  tree, came hurrying along to make his report.    \"Well, Edwards,\" I exclaimed, as the man came bustling up to me, and  saluted, \"I see you have made the signal that a slaver is approaching.  What sort of a craft is she; and how far off?\"    \"She's a very tidy and smart-looking brig, sir, measurin' close upon  three hundred ton, by the look of her; and she's headin' straight for  the eastern end of this here island, clewin' up and furlin' as she  comes.  She was under topsails and to'ga'nts'ls when I shinned down out  of the crow's-nest, yonder; and I reckon she'll reach the anchorage in  about another twenty minutes or so,\" reported the man.    \"Very good,\" I answered.  \"Now, go back to your look-out, and put that  piece of red bunting out of sight as quickly as possible; for if those  slaver fellows should happen to catch sight of it they may suspect  something and be on their guard; which won't do; for, with only a few  convalescents to help me, our sole chance of capturing them lies in the  use of stratagem.\"    Then, as the man turned away and hurried back to his post, I crossed the  open space between the wharf and the buildings, and, giving the  convalescents instructions to arm themselves at once and to stand by to  show themselves when called upon, I entered my own quarters and hastily  shifted from my uniform into a somewhat soiled suit of \"whites\" and a  pith hat that had doubtless once been the property of one of the former  inhabitants of the place--and which I had appropriated in view of some  such contingency as the present--and otherwise made such preparations as  were possible for the suitable reception of our expected visitors.    We had only just barely completed our preparations when the strange  brig, under topsails and fore-topmast staysail, came sweeping round the  eastern extremity of the island, bracing sharp up as she did so and  making a short \"leg\" athwart the anchorage, toward the mainland.  Then,  tacking very smartly, even under such short canvas as she was showing,  she headed well up for the line of buoys which had been laid down as  moorings, and, splendidly handled, presently came up head to wind,  settling away both topsail-yards to the caps as she did so, and, while  her crew clewed up the topsails and hauled down the staysail, glided,  with the way which she still had on her, up to the weathermost buoy, to  which a hawser was promptly run out and made fast.  Then, as about a  dozen hands climbed into the fore and main rigging and made their  leisurely way aloft for the purpose of rolling up the topsails, a light,  handsome gig was dropped into the water from the starboard quarter  davits and presumably hauled alongside the gangway; but this I could not  see, as she was presenting her port broadside to us--which, by the way,  I noticed, was garnished with five grinning twelve-pounders.  She was a  most beautiful vessel, lying long and low upon the water, her hull  painted all black, from her rail to her copper, relieved only by a  single narrow white stripe running along her sheer-strake from her white  figure-head to the rather elaborate white scroll-work that decorated her  quarter.  She was grandly sparred, with very heavy lower-masts, long  mastheads, painted white, very taunt topmasts, topgallant and royal-  masts, stayed to a hair, with a slight rake aft, and accurately  parallel, and enormously long yards.  The French ensign floated lazily  from the end of her standing gaff.    As I stood under the shade of the verandah, admiring this sea beauty,  the gig came foaming round under her stern, propelled by four oarsmen,  and with a white-clad figure in the stern-sheets, and headed toward the  wharf, alongside a flight of steps in which she presently ranged, and  hooked on.  Then the white-clad figure in the stern-sheets rose and,  leisurely climbing the steps to the level of the wharf, revealed itself  as that of a man somewhat over middle height, broadly built, with hair,  beard, and moustache of raven black, and a skin tanned almost to the  colour of that of a mulatto by long exposure to sea-breezes and a  tropical sun.  His age I roughly estimated as somewhere about forty.    With a swaggering sea roll he came striding across the wide arid space  between the wharf side and the buildings, puffing at a big black cigar  as he walked, and glancing about him curiously, as though he could not  quite understand the utter quietude and deserted aspect of the place.  Apparently, however, this was not sufficiently marked to arouse his  suspicion, for he betrayed no hesitation as he made straight for the  house under the broad verandah of which I stood in full view, watching  his approach.  As he came within speaking distance he slightly raised  his broad-brimmed pugaree-bound Panama hat, for a moment, exclaiming, in  execrable Spanish:    \"Good-morning, senor! what has happened that I see nobody about?  And  where is Senor Morillo?  I would have speech with him.\"    Raising my hat in reply, I answered, in the same language: \"I deeply  regret to inform you, senor, that Morillo is indisposed--down with a  slight attack of fever, in fact; and, as for the rest, they are away in  the bush on the other side, whither they have gone to help bring in the  cauffle which is due to arrive this afternoon.  But will you not step in  out of the sun?\"    \"Thanks!\" answered the stranger, ascending the gallery steps.  \"I am  sorry to hear of my friend Morillo's indisposition.  A _slight_ attack  of fever, I think you said.  Is he too ill, think you, to talk business?  If not, you will perhaps have the extreme kindness to tell him that  Captain Lenoir of _La Belle Estelle_ has arrived and would like to see  him.\"    \"Assuredly I will, senor,\" I answered politely.  \"Pray step inside here,  out of the heat, and be seated, while I convey your message to Senor  Morillo.\"    So saying, I flung open the door of an inner room, and stood aside for  him to enter.    Quite unsuspectingly he stalked in through the open door, removed his  hat and laid it upon the table, flung himself into a basket-chair, and,  withdrawing an enormous silk pocket-handkerchief from his pocket,  proceeded to mop the streaming perspiration from his forehead.  At the  same moment I whipped a loaded pistol from my pocket, aimed straight at  his left eye, and, as he stared at me in amazement, said--    \"You are a dead man, Captain Lenoir, if you move so much as a muscle.  You are my prisoner, senor.  No,\"--as I saw by the expression of his eye  that he had it in his mind to suddenly spring upon and disarm me--\"not a  movement, I pray you.  To attempt what you are thinking of would be  fatal, for upon your slightest motion I will pull the trigger and blow  your brains out; I will, as surely as that you are sitting there.\"  Then, slightly raising my voice, I called--    \"Collins, bring your party into this room; and do not forget to bring  along that length of ratline that I told you to have ready.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered Collins; and the reply was followed by the  shuffling sound of several pairs of feet, the owners of which came  shambling into the room the next moment, with naked cutlasses in their  hands, while one of them carried, in addition, a length of some three or  four fathoms of ratline.    Meanwhile, I had never for the smallest fraction of a second withdrawn  my gaze from Captain Lenoir's eyes, or allowed the barrel of my pistol  to waver a hair's-breadth from his larboard optic, for I knew that if I  did he would be upon me like lightning.  But although he dared not move  his limbs he was not afraid to use his tongue, angrily demanding what I  meant by perpetrating such an outrage upon one of Senor Morillo's best  customers, and vowing that he would not be satisfied until he had seen  me flogged within an inch of my life for my insolence.  Then, when I  explained to him the actual state of affairs--while Collins and another  man securely lashed his hands together behind his back--his temper  completely got the better of him, and he raved, and shrieked curses at  us until we were perforce compelled to gag him lest his cries should  reach the men in the boat and give them the alarm.  However, we very  soon secured and silenced him; and then, having marched him out at the  back of the house and secured him in a remote hut by himself, I gave  Collins fresh instructions, after which I sauntered across the open  space of blistering sunshine to the edge of the wharf, and looked down  into the boat.  The four men had already made fast her painter to a ring  in the wharf wall, and were now lolling over the gunwale, staring down  into the deep, clear water at the fish playing about beneath them, and  chatting disjointedly as they sucked at their pipes.    \"It is thirsty work sitting there and grilling in the sun, is it not,  lads?\" said I in French.  \"Come up to the house and drink Senor  Morillo's health in a jug of sangaree; and then Captain Lenoir wants you  to carry down some fruit and vegetables that Senor Morillo has given him  for the ship's use.\"    \"_Bien_! we come, monsieur,\" they answered with one accord; and the next  moment they were all slouching toward the house, a pace or two in my  wake.  I traversed a good three-quarters of the distance from the wharf  to the house, and then halted suddenly and smote my forehead violently,  as though I had just remembered"]]]
