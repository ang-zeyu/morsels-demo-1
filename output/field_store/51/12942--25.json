My desire and aim is, to live solely for the  glory of God and the good of men.    By the advice of Mr. M. S. Bidwell and others, I am induced to continue  the Strachan controversy, till it is brought to a favourable  termination. I shall be heartily glad when it is concluded.--H.]         _Jan. 16th._--One of the Indians (Wm. Sunegoo) has been tempted to       drink. I visited him as soon as he returned to the village. I       entreated him to tell me the whole truth, which he did. After       showing him his sin and ingratitude to God and his friends, he wept       aloud, almost despairing of mercy. I pointed him to the Saviour of       penitent sinners. He fell on his knees, and we spent some time in       prayer. After evening service he confessed his sin publicly, asked       forgiveness of his brethren, and promised in the strength of God to       be more watchful. Thus have we restored our brother in the spirit       of meekness.         _Jan. 26th._--Last Sunday we held our quarterly meeting at York.       About thirty of the Indian brethren were present; their       cleanliness, modesty, and devout piety were the subject of general       admiration.         _Feb. 4th._--To-day I preached to the Indians. Peter Jacobs, an       intelligent youth of 18, interpreted, and afterwards spake with all       the simplicity and eloquence of nature.         A scene never to be forgotten was witnessed by me in visiting an       Indian woman this evening; after months of severe suffering, she       sweetly yielded up the ghost in the triumphs of faith. She embraced       the Christian religion about eight months ago, and was baptized by       Rev. T. Madden. Notwithstanding her many infirmities, she went to       the house of God as long as her emaciated frame, with the       assistance of friends, could be supported. A few days previous to       her decease, she gave (to use her own words) \"her whole heart into       the hands of Jesus, and felt no more sorry now, but wanted to be       with Jesus.\" While addressing a number assembled in her room, who       were weeping around her bed, her happy spirit took its triumphant       flight to the arms of the Saviour she loved so much.         How would the hearts of a Wesley and Fletcher burst forth in       rapture, could they have seen their spiritual posterity gathering       the wandering tribes of the American forest into the fold of       Christ, and heard the wigwam of the dying Indian resound with the       praises of Jehovah!         _Feb. 10th._--A blessed quarterly meeting--Elder Case preached in       the morning, and my brother George in the evening. The singing was       delightful, and the white people present were extremely interested.       At the close a collection of $26.75 was taken up, principally from       the Indians! Peter Jacobs was one of the speakers.         _Feb. 16th._--The importance of fostering our school among the       Indians, and of encouraging the teacher in this discouraging and       very difficult task, cannot be overestimated. Rev. Wm. Case,       thinking that I had some aptitude for teaching, wrote me a day or       two ago, as follows:--         Do you think the multitude of care, and burden of the school does       sometimes mar the patience of the teacher? If so, you would do well       to kindly offer to assist him occasionally, when he is present, and       so by example, as well as by occasional kind remarks, help him to       correct any inadvertencies of taste. I know the burden of a teacher       in a large school, and a perpetual sameness in the same employment,       especially in this business, is a tiresome task. I consider this       school of vast importance, on several accounts, and especially       considering the hopes to be entertained of several interesting       youths there.         _Feb. 27th._--I have written from fifteen to sixteen hours to-day       in vindicating the cause of dissenters against the anathemas of       high churchmen.         _March 5th, 1827._--To-day I am on my way to see my parents. My       Father is becoming serious, and my younger brother Edwy has joined       the Methodist Society. I thank God for this blessed change.    _York, March 8th._--[As an interesting bit of personal history,  descriptive of Dr. Ryerson's manner of life among the Credit Indians, I  give the following extract from a letter written by Rev. William to Rev.  George Ryerson. William says:--    I visited Egerton's Mission at the Credit last week, and was highly  delighted to see the improvement they are making both in religious  knowledge and industry. I preached to them while there, and had a large  meeting and an interesting time. The next morning we visited their  schools. They have about forty pupils on the list, but there were only  thirty present. The rest were absent, making sugar. I am very certain I  never saw the same order and attention to study in any school before.  Their progress in spelling, reading, and writing is astonishing, but  especially in writing, which certainly exceeds anything I ever saw. They  are getting quite forward with their work. When I was there they were  fencing the lots in the village in a very neat, substantial manner. On  my arrival at the Mission I found Egerton, about half a mile from the  village, stripped to the shirt and pantaloons, clearing land with  between twelve and twenty of the little Indian boys, who were all  engaged in chopping and picking up the brush. It was an interesting  sight. Indeed he told me that he spent an hour or more every morning and  evening in this way, for the benefit of his own health, and the  improvement of the Indian children. He is almost worshipped by his  people, and I believe, under God, will be a great blessing to them.--H.]         _March 14th._--After several pleasant days absence I return again       to my Indian brethren. Have been much profited by reading the lives       of Cranmer, Latimer, Burnet, Watts, Doddridge, and especially that       of Philip Skelton, an Irish Prelate. The piety, knowledge, love,       zeal, and unbounded charity, are almost beyond credit; except on       the principle that he that is _spiritual_, can do all things.         _March 19th._--An Indian who has lately come to this place, and has       embraced the religion of Christ, came to Peter Jones, and asked       him, what he should do with his implements of witchcraft, whether       throw them in the fire, or river, as he did not want anything more       to do with them. What a proof of his sincerity! Nothing but       Christianity can make them renounce witchcraft, and many of them       are afraid of it long after their conversion.         _March 20th._--Busy to-day selecting suitable places for planting,       and employed the school boys in clearing some land for pasture.         _March 24th._--I am this day twenty-four years old. During the past       year my principal attention has been called to controversial       labours. If the Lord will, may this cup pass by in my future life.         _March 25th--Sabbath._--This day is the second anniversary of my       ministerial labours. My soul has been refreshed, my tongue       loosened, and my heart warmed.         _April 1st, 1827--Sabbath._--In speaking to my Indian brethren, the       word seemed deeply to affect their hearts.         _April 2nd._--In meeting Class this evening, I spoke for the first       time in Indian. My mind was much affected. The Indians broke forth       in exclamations of joy to hear a white man talk about God and       religion in their own tongue.         _April 6th._--My dear brother William and Dr. T. D. Morrison have       spent a night here, and greatly refreshed me by their converse.         _April 9th._--Another lesson of mortality in the death of Brother       John Jones' only child. I have been trying to comfort the parents,       who seem to bear their trial with Christian fortitude.    _York, April 15th._--[In a letter to his brother George at this date,  Dr. Ryerson thus speaks of the work under his care:--    We are all well, and are blessed in our labours at this place, and at  the Credit. I think the Indians are growing in knowledge and in grace.  They are getting on pretty well with their spring work. But in some  respects they are Indians, though they have become Christians.    I came from Long Point with a full determination to live wholly for God  and His Church. Through the blessing of God I have received greater  manifestations of grace than I had felt before during the year. I have  lately read \"_Law's Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life_,\" which has  been very beneficial to me. My greatest grief of late is, that my love  to God and His people is not more humble, more fervent, and more  importunate. O could I feel as Jesus felt when he said, \"My meat and  drink is to do the will of him that sent me.\" How much more happy and  useful I would be! I pray that I may.    John and Peter Jones seem to thirst after holiness, and are growing in  grace. The Society in this place (York) appears to be increasing in  grace and in number. I was abundantly assisted by heavenly aid to-day,  while preaching. The congregation seemed to be deeply affected this  evening. I hope the word has not gone forth in vain. The Sunday-schools  are prospering in this place. I proposed the new method of increasing  the Sunday-schools, by giving a reward ticket to every scholar who would  procure another that had not attended any other school. In two Sabbaths  between twenty and thirty new scholars were procured in one school.--H.]         _April 16th._--The last part of last week I was powerfully assailed       by the devil, and became greatly dejected.

The splendid garment seemed sent to him by a good  fairy; resolving therefore not to slight so precious a gift, he put  his little stock of money in his pocket, and, favored by the darkness  of the night, wandered forth from Alexandria's gates.    The new prince excited admiration everywhere upon his route, for the  splendid garment, and his serious majestic air, would not allow him to  pass for a common pedestrian. If one inquired of him about it, he took  care to answer, with a mysterious look, that he had his reasons for  it. Perceiving, however, that he rendered himself an object of  ridicule by travelling on foot, he purchased for a small sum an old  horse, which suited him very well, for it never brought his habitual  quiet and mildness into difficulty, by compelling him to show himself  off as an excellent rider, a thing which in reality he was not.    One day, as he was proceeding on his way, step by step, upon his  Murva, (thus had he named his horse,) a stranger joined him, and asked  permission to travel in his company, since to him the distance would  seem much shorter, in conversation with another. The rider was a gay  young man, elegant and genteel in manners. He soon knit up a  conversation with Labakan, with respect to his whence and whither, and  it turned out that he also, like the journeyman tailor, was travelling  without purpose, in the world. He said his name was Omar, that he was  the nephew of Elfi Bey, the unfortunate bashaw of Cairo, and was now  on his way to execute a commission which his uncle had delivered to  him upon his dying-bed. Labakan was not so frank with respect to his  circumstances; he gave him to understand that he was of lofty descent,  and was travelling for pleasure.    The two young men were pleased with each other, and rode on in  company. On the second day, Labakan interrogated his companion Omar,  respecting the commission with which he was charged, and to his  astonishment learned the following. Elfi Bey, the bashaw of Cairo, had  brought up Omar from his earliest childhood; the young man had never  known his parents. But shortly before, Elfi Bey, having been attacked  by his enemies, and, after three disastrous engagements, mortally  wounded, was obliged to flee, and disclosed to his charge that he was  not his nephew, but the son of a powerful lord, who, inspired with  fear by the prophecy of his astrologer, had sent the young prince away  from his court, with an oath never to see him again until his  twenty-second birthday. Elfi Bey had not told him his father's name,  but had enjoined upon him with the greatest precision, on the fourth  day of the coming month Ramadan, on which day he would be  two-and-twenty years old, to repair to the celebrated pillar  El-Serujah, four days' journey east of Alexandria: there he should  offer to the men who would be standing by the pillar, a dagger which  he gave him, with these words, \"Here am I, whom ye seek!\" If they  answered, \"Blessed be the Prophet, who has preserved thee!\" then he  was to follow them--they would lead him to his father.    The journeyman tailor, Labakan, was much astonished at this  information; from this time he looked upon Prince Omar with envious  eyes, irritated because fortune conferred upon him, though already he  passed for the nephew of a mighty bashaw, the dignity of a king's son;  but on him, whom she had endowed with all things necessary for a  prince, bestowed in ridicule, an obscure lineage, and an every-day  vocation. He instituted a comparison between himself and the prince.  He was obliged to confess that the latter was a man of very lively  aspect; that fine sparkling eyes belonged to him, a boldly-arched  nose, a gentlemanly, complaisant demeanor, in a word, all the external  accomplishments, which every one is wont to commend. But numerous as  were the charms he found in his companion, still he was compelled to  acknowledge to himself, that a Labakan would be no less acceptable to  the royal father than the genuine prince.    These thoughts pursued Labakan the whole day; with them he went to  sleep in the nearest night-lodgings; but when he awoke in the morning,  and his eye rested upon Omar sleeping near him, who was reposing so  quietly, and could dream of his now certain fortune, then arose in him  the thought of gaining, by stratagem or violence, what unpropitious  destiny had denied him. The dagger, the returning prince's token of  recognition, hung in the sleeper's girdle; he softly drew it forth, to  plunge it in the breast of its owner. Nevertheless, the peaceable soul  of the journeyman recoiled before thoughts of murder; he contented  himself with appropriating the dagger, and bridling for himself the  faster horse of the prince; and, ere Omar awoke to see himself  despoiled of all his hopes, his perfidious companion was several miles  upon his way.    The day on which Labakan robbed the prince was the first of the holy  month Ramadan, and he had therefore four days to reach the pillar  El-Serujah, the locality of which was well known to him. Although the  region wherein it was situated could at farthest be at a distance of  but four days' journey, still he hastened to reach it, through a  constant fear of being overtaken by the real prince.    By the end of the second day, he came in sight of the pillar  El-Serujah. It stood upon a little elevation, in the midst of an  extensive plain, and could be seen at a distance of two or three  leagues. Labakan's heart beat high at the sight: though he had had  time enough on horseback, for the last two days, to think of the part  he was to play, still a consciousness of guilt made him anxious; the  thought that he was born for a prince, however, encouraged him again,  and he advanced towards the mark with renewed confidence.    The country around the pillar was uninhabited and desert, and the new  prince would have experienced some difficulty in finding sustenance,  if he had not previously supplied himself for several days. He lay  down beside his horse beneath some palm-trees, and there awaited his  distant destiny.    Towards the middle of the next day, he saw a large procession of  horses and camels crossing the plain in the direction of the pillar  El-Serujah. It reached the foot of the hill, on which the pillar  stood; there they pitched splendid tents, and the whole looked like  the travelling-suite of some rich bashaw or sheik. Labakan perceived  that the numerous train which met his eye, had taken the pains to come  hither on his account, and gladly would he that moment have shown them  their future lord; but he mastered his eager desire to walk as  prince; for, indeed, the next morning would consummate his boldest  wishes.    The morning sun awoke the too happy tailor to the most important  moment of his life, which would elevate him from an inferior  situation, to the side of a royal father. As he was bridling his horse  to ride to the pillar, the injustice of his course, indeed, occurred  to him; his thoughts pictured to him the anguish of the true prince,  betrayed in his fine hopes; but the die was cast: what was done could  not be undone, and self-love whispered to him that he looked stately  enough to pass for the son of the mightiest king. Inspirited by these  reflections, he sprang upon his horse, and collecting all his courage  to bring him to an ordinary gallop, in less than a quarter of an hour,  reached the foot of the hill. He dismounted from his horse, and  fastened it to one of the shrubs that were growing near; then he drew  the dagger of Prince Omar, and proceeded up the hill. At the base of  the pillar six persons were standing around an old gray-haired man, of  lofty king-like aspect. A splendid caftan of gold cloth surrounded by  a white Cashmere shawl, a snowy turban spangled with glittering  precious stones, pointed him out as a man of opulence and nobility. To  him Labakan proceeded, and bowing low before him, said, as he extended  the dagger--    \"Here am I, whom you seek.\"    \"Praise to the Prophet who has preserved thee!\" answered the  gray-haired one, with tears of joy. \"Omar, my beloved son, embrace  thine old father!\" The good tailor was deeply affected by these solemn  words, and sank, with mingled emotions of joy and shame, into the arms  of the old noble.    But only for a moment was he to enjoy the unclouded delight of his new  rank; raising himself from the arms of the king, he saw a rider  hastening over the plain in the direction of the hill. The traveller  and his horse presented a strange appearance; the animal, either from  obstinacy or fatigue, seemed unwilling to proceed. He went along with  a stumbling gait, which was neither a pace nor a trot; but the rider  urged him on, with hands and feet, to a faster run. Only too soon did  Labakan recognise his horse Murva, and the real Prince Omar. But the  evil spirit of falsehood once more prevailed within him, and he  resolved, come what might, with unmoved front to support the rights he  had usurped. Already, in the distance, had they observed the horseman  making signs; at length, in spite of Murva's slow gait, having reached  the bottom of the hill, he threw himself from his horse, and began  rapidly to ascend.    \"Hold!\" cried he. \"Hold! whoever you may be, and suffer not yourselves  to be deceived by a most infamous impostor! I am called Omar, and let  no mortal venture to misuse my name!\"    Great astonishment was depicted on the"]]]
