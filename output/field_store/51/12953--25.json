There is a  pocketed cylinder revolving between concave plates, opening into the  hopper above, from which the pockets in the feeder are filled, and  discharging directly into the mixing trough below. Back of this is  shown the feeder for sand or gravel up to 2-in. screen size. This is a  pocketed cylinder similar to that used in the cement feeder, except that  it is larger, and instead of being provided on the discharge side with a  concave plate, is surmounted by a roller, held by springs. This serves  to cut off the excessive flow of material, but provides sufficient  flexibility to allow the rough coarse material to be fed through the  machine without its catching. The feeder for crushed stone is a similar  construction on larger lines, to handle material up to 3-in. size. These  several feeders can be set to give any desired mixture. On any material  fit to be used in concrete, they will measure with an error of less than  5 per cent., an agitator being provided in the sand bin to prevent damp  sand from bridging over the feeder, and preventing its action. The mixer  consists of a trough, with a square shaft, on which are mounted 37  mixing paddles, which are slipped on in rotation, so as to form  practically a continuous conveyor, but as each paddle is distinct, and  is shaped like the mold board of a plow, the material, as it passes from  one to the next, is turned over and stirred. Water is sprayed into the  mass at the center of the trough. The result is a dry mix, followed by a  wet mix. The mixing trough is made of heavy gage steel, well reinforced,  and practically indestructible. To take care of the discharge of  material while changing wheelbarrows, a hood is provided on the  discharge end of the machine, which can be lowered, and will hold about  a wheelbarrow load.    ~Gravity Mixers.~--Gravity mixers are constructed in two general forms.  The first form is a trough whose bottom or sides or both are provided  with pegs, deflectors or other devices for giving the material a zig-zag  motion as it flows down the trough. The second form consists of a series  of hoppers set one above the other so that the batch is spilled from one  into the next and is thus mixed.    The chief advantage claimed for gravity mixers is that no power is  required to operate them. This is obviously so only in the sense that  gravity mixers have no power-operated moving mechanism, and the fact  should not be overestimated. The cost of power used in the actual  performance of mixing is a very small item. The distance between feed  and discharge levels is always greater for gravity mixers than for  machine mixers, and the power required to raise the concrete materials  the excess height may easily be greater than the power required to  operate a machine mixer. On the other hand the simplicity of the gravity  mixer insures low maintenance costs.    _Gilbreth Trough Mixer._--Figure 23 shows the construction of one of the  best known makes of gravity mixers of the trough form. In operation the  cement, sand and stone in the proper proportions are spread in  superimposed layers on a shoveling board at hopper level and are then  shoveled as evenly as possible into the hopper. From the hopper the  materials flow down the trough, receiving the water about half way down,  and are mixed by being cut and turned by the pins and deflectors. The  trough of the mixer is about 10 ft. long.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Gilbreth Gravity Mixer, Trough Form.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Hains Gravity Mixer, Fixed Hopper Form.]    _Hains Gravity Mixer._--The form of gravity mixer made by the Hains  Concrete Mixer Co., Washington, D. C., is shown by Figs. 24 and 25. The  charge passes through the hoppers in succession. Considering first the  stationary plant, shown by Fig. 24, the four hoppers at the top have a  combined capacity of one of the lower hoppers. Each top hopper is  charged with cement, sand and stone in the order named and in the proper  proportions. Water is then dashed over the tops of the filled hoppers  and they are dumped simultaneously into the hopper next below. This  hopper is then discharged into the next and so on to the bottom.  Meanwhile the four top hoppers have been charged with materials for  another batch. It will be observed that (1) the concrete is mixed in  separate batches and (2) the ingredients making a batch are accurately  proportioned and begin to be mixed for the whole batch at once. The best  arrangement is to have the top of the hopper tower carry sand and stone  bins which chute directly into the top hoppers. In the telescopic mixer  shown by Fig. 25 the purpose has been to provide a mixer which, hung  from a derrick or cableway, will receive a charge of raw materials at  stock pile and deliver a batch of mixed concrete to the work, the  operation of mixing being performed during the hoist to the work. By  providing two mixers so that one can be charged while the other is being  hoisted continuous operation is secured. The following are records of  operation of stationary gravity mixers of this type.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Hains Gravity Mixer, Telescoping Hopper Form.]    In building a dock at Baltimore, Md., a plant consisting of two large  hoppers and four charging hoppers with sand and stone bins above was  used. One man at each large conical hopper tending the gates and two men  charging the four pyramidal hoppers composed the mixer gang. A scow load  of sand and another of stone were moored alongside the work and a  clam-shell bucket dredge loaded the material from these barges into the  mixer bins. Each batch was 25 cu. ft. of 1-2-5 concrete rammed in place.  The men at the upper hoppers would empty a sack of cement in each, and  then by opening gates in the bottom of the bins above, allow the  necessary amounts of sand and stone to flow in, marks having been  previously made on the sides of the hoppers to show the correct  proportion of each of the ingredients. The amount of water found by  experience to be necessary, would then be dashed into the hoppers, and  the charges allowed to run into the first cone hopper below. Refilling  would begin at the top while the men were caring for the first charge in  the lower hoppers. The process was thus continuous. The concrete was  chuted directly into place from the bottom hopper. The record of output  was 110 batches per 10-hour day. Wages of common labor were $1.50 per  day. The labor cost per cubic yard of concrete in place was 35 cts.    In constructing the Cedar Grove reservoir at Newark, N. J., a Hains  mixer made the following records of output:                                               Cu. yds.  Best output per 10-hour day                     403  Average daily output for best month             302  Average daily output for whole job              225    The stone, sand and cement were all raised by bucket elevators to the  top of the high wooden tower that supported the bins and mixer. There  were 10 men operating the mixer so that (exclusive of power, interest  and depreciation) the labor cost of mixing averaged only 7 cts. per cu.  yd.; during one month it was as low as 5 cts. per cu. yd. This does not  include delivering the materials to the men at the mixer, nor does it  include conveying the concrete away and placing it. The work was done by  contract.    ~OUTPUT OF MIXERS.~--With a good mixer the output depends upon the methods  of conveying the materials to and from the mixer. Most makers of mixers  publish capacities of their machines in batches or cubic yards output  per hour; these figures may generally be taken as stating nearly the  maximum output possible. Considering batch mixers, as being the type  most commonly used, it may be assumed that where the work is well  organized and no delay occurs in delivering the materials to the mixer  that a batch every 2 minutes, or 300 batches in 10 hours, will be  averaged, and there are a few records of a batch every 1½ minutes.    To illustrate to how great an extent the output of a mixer depends on  the methods adopted in handling the materials to and from the mixer we  compare two actual cases that came under the authors' observation. The  mixers used were of the same size and make. In one case the stone was  shoveled into the charging hopper by four men and the sand and cement  were delivered in barrows by four other men; six men took the concrete  away in wheelbarrows. The output of the mixer was one batch every 5  minutes, or 120 batches, or 60 cu. yds., in 10 hours. In the other case  the sand and the stone were chuted directly into the charging hopper  from overhead bins and the mixer discharged into one-batch buckets on  cars. The output of the mixer was one batch every 2 minutes, or 300  batches in 10 hours. In the first case the capacity of the mixer was  limited by the ability of a gang of workable size to get the raw  materials to and the mixed concrete away from the mixer. In the second  case the capacity was limited only by the amount of mixing deemed  necessary.    While the necessity of rapid charging of a mixer to secure its best  output is generally realized it is often forgotten that the rapidity of  discharge is also a factor of importance. The size of the conveyor by  which the concrete is removed affects the time of discharge. By timing a  string of wheelbarrows in line the authors have found that it takes  about 7 seconds to fill each barrow; as a rule slight delays will  increase this time to 10 seconds. With a load of 1 cu. ft. per barrow it  requires 13 barrow loads to take away a ½ cu. yd. batch. This makes the  time of discharging a batch 130 seconds, or say 2 minutes. The same  mixer discharging into a batch size bucket will discharge in 15 to 20  seconds, saving at least 1½ minutes in discharging each batch.    ~MIXER EFFICIENCY.~--Various attempts have been made to rate the  efficiency of concrete mixers. In all cases a percentage basis of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],[0,"The Story of Wool (#19)"],[1,"ains.\"    \"Oh, I am all right, Mr. Munger,\" the bookkeeper hastened to say. \"Just  a bit tired, perhaps--that is all.\"    \"If you are tired you should try the ranges of Idaho,\" Mr. Clark said.  \"My boy, here, and myself have recently returned from a year in the  sheep country and feel like new men, don't we, Don? Undoubtedly the life  there may not be as gay as in the city; still--to quote my manager,  Sandy McCulloch, 'with bears, bob-cats, and coyotes, I dinna see how it  could ever be dull.'\"    So perfectly had Mr. Clark imitated Sandy's voice and accent that  Thornton and Donald both laughed. Then they stopped suddenly.    The young bookkeeper had turned very pale and was eying them with a  startled face.    \"Sandy McCulloch!\" he repeated. \"Did you say Sandy McCulloch, sir?\"    \"Yes, Sandy McCulloch,\" answered Mr. Clark. \"Do you know him?\"    \"He must be of your kin, Mac!\" interrupted Mr. Munger. \"This lad,  strangely enough, is a McCulloch himself--Douglas McCulloch.\"    \"Then you must be--you are Sandy's brother!\" cried Donald.    The young man swayed a little and put out his hand to steady himself.    It seemed to Donald as if he would never speak.    When he did his voice was tremulous with emotion.    \"Yes,\" he replied almost in a whisper. \"I am Sandy's brother. Tell me of  Sandy and of my father.\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XIII    DONALD DECIDES      It was a wonderful story, Donald thought.    He was never tired of living over how, in visiting the Mortonstown  mills, they had so unexpectedly found Douglas McCulloch; how, because of  ill health, he was on the point of going West; and how, with Mr.  Munger's permission, Mr. Clark had offered him the position as Sandy's  assistant at Crescent Ranch. It was little short of a miracle that it  had all come about!    It was interesting, too, to hear what had happened to Douglas after he  left Idaho. When he first reached the East it was indeed a rude  awakening from his dreams of city life; living was expensive, and work  hard to find. Chance had borne him to the Monitor Mills where, because  of his knowledge of wool, he had succeeded in getting a job at sorting  fleeces. He had worked hard and patiently, and Mr. Bailey, who was quick  to appreciate faithfulness, had promoted him until he had won the  position of head bookkeeper. These years of vigorous work had, however,  left their mark on one unaccustomed to long hours and little fresh air.  In his heart the boy sighed for the hills--he wanted to be back again in  the Western country which he so foolishly had insisted upon leaving. He  became tired and thin, and the men for whom he worked were unselfish  enough to see that unless he got back to the open ranges and to the  sunlight he would soon be too ill to go.    And now the chance had come--it was almost unbelievable!    \"I cannot realize that I am really to join Sandy,\" exclaimed the  Scotchman over and over. \"It is almost too much good luck. As a lad I  was so eager to get away from the range that I would never have dreamed  the time could come when I would be pining to return there. I have had  my taste of the East! I would have gone back long ago had they not been  so good to me here.\"    \"But why didn't you write to Sandy, Douglas?\" inquired Donald.    \"Well, you see, although my father let me leave Crescent Ranch it  disappointed him not a little to have me do so. Sandy thought, since my  father felt that way, that I ought not to go, and we had words about it.  I was very angry with Sandy at the time, but I see now that he was  right. I wish I had stayed with my father. Then when I began to be  homesick here and it all turned out just as Sandy had said I was ashamed  to write. Even now I am almost afraid Sandy will not want to see me.\"    \"Indeed he will!\" cried Donald. \"Why, often he talked about you when we  were on the range together, and wished he might see you. My father has  wired him already and he can hardly wait to get you back to Idaho.\"    \"If only my father were there!\" said Douglas sadly. \"I shall never  forgive myself that I came East and left him. I wish I had the chance to  live over again and I would do differently.\"    \"If we did not learn wisdom by what we do there would be no use in  living, Douglas,\" Mr. Clark put in kindly. \"At least you are going West  to Sandy--going to be a great help to him in his work.\"    \"I am so thankful that I can,\" replied the younger brother. \"Think of  going once more to Idaho and running that great ranch with him! It is  more than I deserve.\"    \"Make the most of your good fortune, Douglas,\" Mr. Clark said, \"and do  not disappoint Sandy and me.\"    \"I will try, sir!\" was the humble response.    Douglas McCulloch was as good as his word.    From the moment he and Sandy were united at Crescent Ranch he threw  himself heart and soul into his new work. The charm of the hills stole  over him with a fascination they had never held in those far-off days  when he was a restless boy, eager for the excitement of city life.  Douglas had had his fling, and he returned to the vast Western land  older and wiser.    Together he and Sandy set about improving the ranch. They subscribed to  magazines on sheep-raising; they visited other ranches and kept abreast  of the times; they installed newer and more hygienic methods of  wool-growing. Never had Crescent Ranch been so perfectly run. With two  intelligent and unwearying young men at its head it bid fair to outshine  the fame it had possessed in Old Angus's day. Gradually men interested  in sheeping came from far and near to visit it. Clark & Sons began to be  very proud to be the owners of such a treasure.    Thornton, in the meantime, had become Mr. Clark's right hand man at the  Eastern office. From foreman he had worked up to being superintendent,  and had then been promoted to traveling for the firm and selling wool.  His devotion to Mr. Clark and everything that concerned him was  unfailing.    During these years Donald had completed his school work; had taken his  four years at college; and loyal to his early ambition, had entered the  Law School. If it was a disappointment to his father for him to choose  the law instead of a business career Mr. Clark did not say so. He kept  closely in touch with the boy's studies and was proud of the future  before him.    It was just as everything seemed to be moving so ideally that the first  great calamity fell upon Clark & Sons. One morning a telegram came from  Sandy saying that a big fire had swept the ranch, leveling to the ground  house, barns, and sheep-pens. The blaze had come about through no one's  carelessness. Lightning had struck the central barn, and before aid  could be summoned the entire place had been destroyed.    Fortunately no one had been injured. The herders, together with their  flocks, were on the range; and the crops of alfalfa had not been cut and  were therefore saved.    \"It might have been much worse, Don,\" said Mr. Clark in reviewing the  situation. \"We have lost no men, no sheep, no hay, no wool. Suppose the  fire had come in shearing time and had destroyed all the fleeces; or  suppose the blaze had come about through carelessness and Sandy and  Douglas had had themselves to blame for it. As it is, it is nobody's  fault--I am glad of that--and nothing has been lost but can be restored.  The buildings are well covered by insurance and can be rebuilt during  the summer. The chief trouble is that all this has happened at a time  when I am very busy. I ought to go to Idaho, but I hardly see----\"    \"Can't I go, father?\" interrupted Donald quickly. \"I don't see why I  couldn't adjust the insurance and help about having new buildings put  up. Sandy and Douglas have good judgment, and before I started you could  tell me just what you want done. Besides,\" he added shyly, \"I am now  through my first year at the Law School and have some little knowledge  of legal affairs--that is, I know more than I used to.\"    Mr. Clark beamed.    \"You could go in my place perfectly well, Don, if you are willing to  give up your summer vacation to it. It would certainly be a great help.  But how about those house-parties you had planned for?\"    \"I can decline those, father. I'd be glad to go!\" was Donald's reply. \"I  always promised Sandy I would come West again some time, and I should  really enjoy another glimpse of the hills.\"    So it was arranged.    Within two days Donald was speeding West, and almost before he realized  it he was back at Crescent Ranch.    Then came letters for Mr. Clark.    The insurance was adjusted and with the aid of the McCullochs, Donald  was drawing up plans for new barns--barns with cement floors, and far  better ventilated and equipped than the old ones had been. Almost every  day brought to the Eastern office pages and pages of sketches for  sheep-folds and modern contrivances for lessening the labor of  wool-growing. Every line of these letters bubbled with enthusiasm. There  could be no possible question that Donald's heart was in every word he  wrote.    Summer passed and the time for the beginning of the college term drew  near.    Mr. Clark began to look for the boy's return.    Still there was no Donald!    Then came another letter:                     _Crescent Ranch, Glen City, Idaho._        DEAR FATHER:        You have been so generous in letting me follow out my own wishes as      to my future, that I hardly know how to write you. I hope you will      not be disappointed when you hear what I am going to say. The fact      is, dad, after thinking the matter well over I have changed my mind      about studying law. I have become tremendously interested in      Crescent Ranch and in wool-growing, and I am wild to jump into the      work.        If I thought you approved I should like to stay out here and see the      buildings finished and then go to Kansas City with Sandy to select      more sheep. If, however, you wish me to continue my law course I"]]]
