The  moorland air at 8 a.m. was so fresh and pure and exhilarating that it  seemed to blow away all the cobwebs, and Gwen often felt inclined to  dance along the path for sheer joy of the sun and the wind, and the  birds and the countless green things that were rapidly showing their  heads through the brown skeletons of last autumn's heather and  bilberry. The thrill of springtime is a totally different sensation  from what we experience on even the most gorgeous day in October;  there is a message of hope in the air, a foretaste of the coming  summer, a glow of reawakened vitality, an exaltation half physical and  half spiritual, as every year nature tells us afresh in her own  fashion the miracle of the Resurrection.    Life was a busy round at the Parsonage. Winnie devoted each moment she  could spare to the garden and the hen-yard, and Gwen, who at present  had a craving for out-of-doors, lent a hand as often as she could. She  whistled and sang over her work as she transplanted forget-me-nots,  sowed seeds, or tidied up the rockery, and her stalwart arms made the  lawn mower fly.    \"There's some advantage in growing!\" she declared, as she trundled  away the wheelbarrow full of weeds. \"My muscles have hardened since  last year. I'll wheel you back up the garden, Martin, if you like.  Tumble in!\"    Gwen and Winnie had a great scheme between them of building a summer  house, and every Saturday they managed to get on a little with their  operations. There was a large pile of young felled trees in the yard  which Mr. Gascoyne had bought for firewood, and some of these were  admirable for the purpose. With considerable toil they dragged out  half a dozen, dug holes in the ground, and planted them as posts to  make a framework. Smaller boughs were nailed across and across, and  then bunches of heather were tucked and tied securely into all the  interstices. The roof was at first a terrible problem, till Winnie  conceived the brilliant idea of using an old worn-out gate that lay in  the orchard. It was heavy to lift, but with the aid of Father,  Beatrice, and Nellie the maid, they managed to heave it up so that it  rested securely upon the six posts. Then they thatched it neatly with  heather and fir boughs.    \"I don't suppose for a moment that it will be watertight,\" said  Winnie; \"but we shan't use it in wet weather. What I want is a nice  shady place to sit in at the end of the tennis lawn. It will be  perfectly lovely to have tea here. I believe I can make seats with  some of those stumps.\"    \"I'd back you to do anything in the joinering line,\" laughed Dick, who  still came for lessons on Saturday mornings, and generally stayed to  chat and help the gardeners, though he was yet debarred from any very  violent exertions, greatly to his indignation. \"You ought to be a  Colonial. I believe you'd be equal to running up a shanty on your own  and making the furniture out of old boxes.\"    \"Perhaps I'll emigrate some day,\" nodded Winnie. \"It would be more in  my line than teaching. I'll leave University honours to Gwen, and try  my luck in another hemisphere. Women are wanted in Canada if they're  domesticated--and I flatter myself I'm that.\"    \"Don't know that I won't join you when I've got my degree!\" declared  Gwen. \"I've yearned to go to Canada ever since I saw those ripping  pictures on the kinematograph--only Father'd have to promise to come  and see me every fortnight.\"    \"How particularly possible! Gwen, you're a rotter!\" chirped Dick,  throwing a piece of stick at her. \"I thought your last idea was to  study medicine and go to College with me.\"    \"Perhaps I shan't be able to do either: scholarships don't grow on  every bush like blackberries. Probably I'll just have to stay at home  and 'wash dishes and feed the swine'. By the by, we haven't shown you  our eleven little pigs! They're absolute darlings, as sweet as the  Duchess's baby in _Alice in Wonderland_. Come along this instant, and  I'll catch one for you to nurse. We've never had a pet pig before, but  I declare I mean to tame one of these. They're the sharpest, cutest  little scaramouches you ever saw: as funny as kittens, and twice as  intelligent as puppies. Yes; I'm a pig enthusiast at present, and if  you laugh I'll make you buy one for yourself!\"    There was plenty of scope for Gwen's energy as spring came on and  added hatch after hatch of fluffy chickens and downy ducklings to  Winnie's hen-yard. She helped to arrange the coops, to make wired  enclosures for the tiny chicks, and, hardest task of all, to collect  the young pullets and cockerels that were allowed to roam on the  common, and lock them up safely for the night.    \"No one who hasn't tried henkeeping could possibly conceive the  difficulty of getting in those wretched long-legged, half-fledged  fowls,\" declared Gwen. \"They know I'm going to shut them up, and  they're so clever they come for the Indian corn when I call 'chuck,  chuck', and eat it with one eye upon me. Then when I try to cajole  them into the henhouse they fly all ways. Lesbia, you may come and act  guard, but I won't have the boys; they only rush about and frighten  the chickens. The last time I took Stumps the Buff Orpington with the  black feather in its tail flew over the hedge into the turnip field.  I didn't get him back till it was moonlight, then I caught him  perching on a stump, and carried him round.\"    The particular pride of Winnie's heart was a clutch of little  Partridge Wyandottes, mothered by a comfortable old Plymouth Rock hen.  The setting of eggs had been given her by a farmer's wife in the  neighbourhood; they were from a particularly good strain, and ten out  of the dozen had hatched and thrived. She watched over them with more  than ordinary zeal, leaving manifold instructions with Nellie for  their diet during her absence at school, and visiting them the very  first after her return each afternoon. On the evenings when she took  the choir practice at church she entrusted them solely to Gwen's  charge.    \"Give them a last feed of 'Chikko', and see that they've got clean  water, and don't let Jingles go near them, because the old hen gets  excited, and stamps about and treads on them,\" urged Winnie one  Wednesday as she started off with a roll of music in her hand. \"Be  sure you shut them up early, because Nellie says she saw a rat last  night, and I noticed something had been burrowing near the shed.\"    Gwen promised complete accordance with all directions, and then went  off to finish her Latin translation. It was a particularly stiff piece  of Virgil, and she puzzled over it so long that she utterly forgot all  about the chickens, and it was only the call of an owl waking up on  the ivy-covered ash tree at the bottom of the garden that reminded her  of her henwife's duties.    \"Gracious! It's nearly dark!\" she exclaimed, flinging down Virgil and  making a rush for the hen-yard. \"I hope to goodness those chicks are  all right! What an idiot I am! Winnie will be ready to slay me if  anything's happened to them.\"    It was growing very dusk indeed, and though none of the doors were yet  shut, the feathered flock had all gone to roost. As Gwen crossed the  hen-yard she suddenly saw something dark and shadowy creep from behind  the shed and dart stealthily in the direction of the coops. It  disappeared inside the very one where the cherished Partridge  Wyandottes were cuddling under their foster-mother's wings. Gwen's  heart almost stood still. She well knew the cunning and daring of  rats, and how they would snatch the chicks or young ducklings from the  wariest and most warlike hen. To leave this in the coop for even a  minute while she went to call help would certainly result in the loss  of one or more of Winnie's favourites.    Very cautiously she peered inside. The hen, who knew her well, clucked  softly, and the chickens popped their little speckly heads out from  the mass of encircling feathers and \"peeped\" gently. They were not yet  aware of danger. Where was the rat? It appeared to have vanished into  thin air. It certainly could not have left the coop. At the opposite  end from where the hen was sitting there was a billet of wood, and on  looking at this closely she saw a long tail dangling out underneath.  Without doubt her enemy had taken refuge there and was hiding in the  corner.    \"These precious chicks have got to be saved somehow or Winnie'll never  forgive me,\" muttered Gwen, clenching her teeth to brace her nerves.    Then she did a thing from which her whole spirit shrank. She took her  handkerchief in her hand to give her a firmer grip and seized hold of  the tail. She dragged the rat out of the coop and bore it off, hanging  head downwards and whirling round and round in vain effort to escape,  while it squeaked with wrath and indignation. Fortunately it could not  raise its head sufficiently to bite her or she might have suffered a  nasty wound. Gwen rushed towards the back door, shouting loudly for  Nellie, but when that worthy domestic saw what she carried she uttered  a yell of terror instead of offering help.    \"Throw it down, Miss Gwen, it'll bite you!\" she shrieked. \"Oh!  gracious goodness! throw it down!\"    \"Bring the poker! Where's Jingles?\" screamed Gwen. Then, realizing  that she could hold her wriggling burden no longer, she dropped the  rat into the water-butt, and catching up the yard brush which lay  handily near, held down the victim till it was drowned.    \"Miss Gwen! How did you dare!\" shivered Nellie.    \"Ugh! It's a hateful, horrid, barbarous thing to have to do. I feel as  if I'd committed a murder. It's made me quite sick,\" said Gwen.  \"Nellie, do go and shut up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#19)"],[1,", and on  a lower level, to suit the slope of the ground, a chapel has been  erected that is reached from the south aisle by a stair. It is  barrel-vaulted and is lighted by an eastern window. There are ambries in  the walls and an eastern altar with a piscina. There are also a  fireplace and a small closet on the north side. On the south a door  leads to what has been an open court, where there are indications of  other buildings having existed or being intended. In all probability  there was a residence here, and the chapel may have served both as  sacristy and private chapel. This chapel was probably built by the  liberality of Lady Douglas, Sir William St. Clair's first wife.    The church is profusely adorned with sculpture which generally  represents Scripture scenes, and one of the most curious examples in the  remarkable decoration of the edifice is the ornamentation of the south  pillar of the east aisle, known as the \"Prentice Pillar\"--named by  Slezer (1693) as the \"Prince's Pillar\" and by Defoe (1723) the  \"Princess's Pillar.\" It consists of a series of wreaths twisted round  the shaft, each wreath curving from base to capital round one quarter of  the pillar. The ornamentation of the wreaths corresponds in character  with the other carving of the church, and the grotesque animals on the  base find a counterpart in those of the chapter-house pillar at Glasgow  Cathedral.    At the Reformation the lands and revenue of the church were virtually  taken away, and in 1572 they were relinquished by a formal deed of  resignation. The chapel does not seem to have suffered much violence  till 1688, when a mob did much mischief. It remained uncared for, and  gradually became ruinous till the middle of the eighteenth century, when  General St. Clair glazed the windows, relaid the floor, renewed the  roof, and built the wall round about. Further repairs were executed by  the first Earl of Rosslyn, and again by the third Earl, who spent L3000  principally in renewing and retouching the carvings of the Lady  Chapel--a work said to have been suggested by the Queen, who visited the  church in 1842. Since 1862, services in connection with the Scottish  Episcopal Church have been held within it. At the west end a vestry and  organ-chamber were erected a few years ago.    _Stirling (Chapel Royal, St. Mary's, and St. Michael's)._--On the north  side of the Castle Square is the building erected by King James VI. as a  chapel, and generally called now the armoury. There seems to have been a  chapel in the castle founded by Alexander I., and it was connected with  the monastery at Dunfermline. The original dedication is unknown, but in  the fourteenth century there is mention of the chapel of St. Michael,  which may possibly date from the time when an Irish ecclesiastic--St.  Malachi or Michael--visited David I. at Stirling Castle, and healed his  son, Prince Henry. The chapel was rebuilt in the early part of the  fifteenth century, and in the time of James III. became an important  church. It was constituted both as a royal chapel and as a musical  college, and endowed with the rich temporalities of Coldingham Abbey.  This chapel was the scene of the penitence of James IV., who, after the  victory at Sauchie, \"daily passed to the Chapel Royal, and heard matins  and evening song: in the which every day the chaplains prayed for the  King's grace, deploring and lamenting the death of his father: which  moved the King, in Stirling, to repentance, that he happened to be  counselled to come against his father in battle, wherethrough he was  wounded and slain. To that effect he was moved to pass to the dean of  the said Chapel Royal, and to have his counsel how he might be  satisfied, in his own conscience, of the art and part of the cruel deed  which was done to his father. The dean, being a godly man, gave the King  a good comfort: and seeing him in repentance, was very glad thereof.\"  James IV. endowed the chapel with large revenues, and in 1501 erected it  into a collegiate church for dean, subdean, chanter, sacristan,  treasurer, chancellor, archpriests, sixteen chaplains, six singing boys  and a choir master. It was the richest of the provostries, and held many  churches. The deans of the chapel, who were first the provosts of  Kirkheugh at St. Andrews, afterwards the bishops of Galloway, and  eventually the bishops of Dunblane, possessed in their capacity as deans  an episcopal jurisdiction. The chapel, erected by James III., fell  evidently into a ruinous condition, and in 1594 James VI. pulled the old  structure down and erected on its site the present building. It was the  scene of the baptism of Prince Henry.      ST. GILES, EDINBURGH        \"In the centre of the old town of Edinburgh,\" writes Dr. Cameron      Lees, \"stands the great church of St. Giles. From whatever point of      view the city is looked at, the picturesque crown of the steeple is      seen sharply outlined against the sky. Soaring aloft unlike every      other spire in its neighbourhood, it seems like the spirit of old      Scottish history, keeping watch over the city that has grown up      through the long years beneath its shadow. Edinburgh would not be      Edinburgh without it. The exterior of the church itself is plain and      unadorned, and it is evident that unsympathetic hands have been laid      upon it and modernised it; but when one enters the building, a vast      and venerable interior is presented to him, and every stone seems to      speak of the past. St. Giles is a church whose history is closely      interwoven with the history of Scotland from the very earliest ages,      and it has been the scene of many remarkable events which have left      their impress upon our national character.\"[241]    Dr. David Laing thinks that a parish church of small dimensions may have  existed nearly coeval with the castle and town,[242] and the present St.  Giles occupies the site of the original parish church of Edinburgh.  Symeon of Durham, who flourished in the early part of the thirteenth  century, includes Edinburgh under the year 854 in reckoning the churches  and towns belonging to the Bishopric of Lindisfarne or Holy Island, in  the district of Northumbria, a see which, previous to the Scoto-Saxon  period, extended over the range of Lothian and the more southern  districts of North Britain.[243] The name \"Edwinesburch\" is taken as  having a special reference to the castle and town.[244] When David I.  founded the abbey in honour of the Holy Cross, the Virgin Mary, and all  the saints, he conferred upon the canons (among other churches) the  church of the castle, the Church of St. Cuthbert under the castle wall,  and at the period there were lands lying to the south of Edinburgh which  bore the name of St. Giles' Grange--so called from being the grange of  the vicar of St. Giles' Church. These lands were gifted by King David I.  to the English abbey of Holm Cultram or Harehope in Cumberland, and  probably the church went along with them; at all events, it continued to  belong to some monastery. In 1393 it belonged to the Crown, and King  Robert III. granted it to the Abbey of Scone; to that house it belonged  for some time, remaining still an humble vicarage.[245]    It is the most reasonable conjecture that the parish church, dedicated  in honour of St. AEgidius or St. Giles, and which has ever since  retained the name of that patron saint, was erected during the reign of  Alexander I. (1107-1124), the founder also of the Abbey of Scone and  other religious houses.[246] Some fragments of this church remained till  the end of last century, the richly ornamented Norman porch, which had  formed the entrance to the nave on the north side of the church, being  removed about 1797.[247] Dr. Lees thinks that possibly some of the  pillars of the choir, and also the door at the entry to the royal pew,  belonged to the first church of St. Giles.[248] The edifice appears to  have been rebuilt about the time of David II.[249]    In the frequent wars with England, Edinburgh suffered much, notably so  in 1322 and 1335. This latter raid, having occurred in February, was  afterwards known as the \"burnt Candlemas.\" A reconstruction of the  church was probably required after these repeated conflagrations, and  this appears to have been carried out during the fourteenth century. But  shortly afterwards a devastation of the town and its buildings was  occasioned by Richard II. in 1385, when, during his occupation of five  days, he left the town and parish church in ashes. The citizens, with  the help of the Crown, made a great effort to repair the disaster to  their church, and from this period the history of the present structure  may be said to date.        \"It is said that during the restoration, which took place in      1870-80, traces of fire were observed on the pillars of the choir,      and it is inferred that these pillars must have existed before the      burning caused by Richard II. This view is confirmed by the fact      that, after 1387, when, doubtless, the town authorities were doing      all they could to complete the restoration of St. Giles', they      entered into a contract with certain masons to erect five chapels      along the south side of the nave, having pillars and vaulted roofs,      covered with dressed stone slabs. These chapels still exist, and the      wall rib of the vaulting is yet visible on the south side of the      arcade, next the south aisle; but the vault and stone roof have been      removed, and a plaster ceiling of imitation vaulting substituted.      The above contract indicates that the walls of the nave then      existed. We must, therefore, assume that the church had been rebuilt      previous to the destruction of 1385, and that the above contract was      an addition to the building connected with its restoration two years      after the fire. Although, doubtless, much injured by the      conflagration,"]]]
