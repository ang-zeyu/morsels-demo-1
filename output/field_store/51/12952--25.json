That bucket of water was delicious, and so was the hearty meal which  followed, and after being assured by the hearty old German that the  cattle were properly tended, and seeing to Breezy himself--an act which  brought the old trader's fat hand down upon his back with \"Goot poy:  alvays dake gare of your goot horse youzelf,\"--the house was re-entered,  the door shut, and the host stood up, closed his eyes, and said a prayer  in his native tongue, ending by blessing Dyke in true patriarchal  fashion.    That night Dyke slept as he had not slept for weeks, and woke up the  next morning wondering that he could feel so fresh and well, and  expecting to see Kaffir Jack at the other end of the wagon, curled up in  a blanket; but though the dog was in his old quarters, Jack was absent,  and Dyke supposed that he was asleep beneath.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    A RESTING-PLACE.    \"You are petter as offer you vas, heh?\" cried the old trader, thrusting  his face in between the canvas curtains of the wagon end.  \"Yes, quite  well.  Good-morning.\"    \"Ach zo.  It is a goot mornings.  Ant how is der tog?  You vill say how  to you are to dem alt Oom Morgenstern.  He is goot tog ten, and getting  himself mended ferry quickly.  How vas it he shall pe scratch and pite  all ofer hims, heh?\"    The old man patted and stroked the dog with his big fat hand, as he  spoke in a soft soothing tone, which had the effect of making him the  best of friends with Duke, who whined and licked at the hand, and kept  up a regular throbbing pat-pat-pat upon the floor of the wagon.    \"Ach yes, ten, he is a ferry goot togs, and he shall pe effer zo much  petter zoon.  Ant zo der pig spotty gat gom und dake him, heh?\"    \"Yes, poor fellow, one of the great brutes pounced upon him suddenly,  and fetched him from right under the wagon,\" said Dyke.  \"You were bad,  weren't you, Duke, old chap?\"    The dog threw up his head and uttered a loud howl, and then began to  lick the cuts torn by the leopard's sharp claws.    \"Ach! he vas pad, den,\" said the old man.  \"But das ist goot vizzick for  goots und pites.  Der tog's tongue ist as goot as his tooses ist pad.  Ant zo you zhoot hims, heh?\"    \"What!--the leopard?\" said Dyke.  \"Yes, I shot and hit him, I suppose;  but I was afraid of hitting the dog.  I fired, though, as a last  chance.\"    \"It was guide right,\" said the old man, nodding his head.  \"You do not  shoode--you do noding, and der leopards garry away den hund.  You do  shoode, und if you shoode him, it is petter than for hims to be eaten  oop alife, und you may shoode den leopard.  Zo!  I am happy das you hafe  zave den tog.

You know what ist das?\"    Dyke shook his head.    \"Das ist goot Deutsch for breakfass, mein young vrient.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" cried Dyke.  \"I never learnt Dutch.\"    \"Nein, nein, nein, goot bube.  Not Dutch.  I did say Deutsch--Sharmans.\"    \"But you are a Boer, are you not?\"    \"Nein.  I did gom ofer from Sharmany dwenty year ago.  Dere ist blendy  of Dutch Boer varder on.  I am Deutsch.\"    \"I'll recollect,\" said Dyke eagerly.--\"But how is Jack the Kaffir?  Is  he lying down under the wagon?\"    \"Nein,\" cried the old man sharply.  \"As zoon as he zee me gom, shoost  when it ist morgen, und he zee mein big shdick, he shoomp oop und go und  veed den pferd horse, as he know he should.  He's guide well, dank you,  now, and work ferry hart, like a goot poy.\"    The old man wrinkled up his face, shut his eyes, and indulged in a  hearty, silent laugh.    \"I am zorry,\" he said, suddenly growing serious; \"und I veed and nurse a  boor mans, und I zay to him: `Lie you there und go to sleep dill you are  besser.'

I did want him to come and look  for gold.\"    \"Ach! der golt ist no goot, bube.  Effery potty goes to look for den  golt.  You dell him to go und look for die diamonds.\"    \"Yes, but where?\" said Dyke drily.    \"Dunder und lightning!

Now you shdop dat ruck a dongue of yours, und do not dalk zo  motch like an old vool, und gom und hafe zom breakfast, or the old frau  vill gom after us mit a shdick.\"    He winked comically at Dyke, and led the way to the house, where there  was a warm welcome, and a delicious breakfast of bread and milk and  coffee waiting, with glorious yellow butter and fried bacon to follow.        CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    OOM MORGENSTERN'S SERMON.    Duke was fed directly after the meal, and curled up afterward to \"ged  himselfs guide well again as effers.\"  Soon after Dyke came across Jack,  who was returning from driving the bullocks down to the stream for  water, and now carefully saw to their being in the best bit of the old  man's pasture for a good feed and rest.    \"Ach zo!\" cried the old man, \"he ist a creat deal potter, mein young  vrient.--You Shack, you hafe work well.  You gan go to mein haus, und  die frau will give you blenty of mealie gake und zom milk.  You don't  eat doo motch, or you will pe pad again, und want dem shdick.  You  oontershdant?\"    Jack, whose face had been very pitiful and pleading, brightened up at  this, and ran toward the house, while old Morgenstern turned and  favoured Dyke with one of his winks.    \"You zee now, my younger vrient, he ist like a pig shild dot has been  oop der shimney.  You must hid him hart negs dime.  You did hid doo  zoft.\"    \"Soft!\" cried Dyke.  \"Why, I thought I had killed him.\"    \"Ach, yes, you dought zo; but der plack man's het is sehr dick.  You hid  an Englishman, or a Deutschman, or a Boer, and his het ist tin; but a  plack man's het is dick.  I dink zomdimes ven he ist so shdupid dot it  ist all hart bone right froo.

And here Dyke produced his list, and corn, meal, bacon, tea, sugar,  coffee, and salt were measured and weighed out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#19)"],[1," _The Snowy Egret_    And now, my dear children, I shall finish this chapter by telling you  about a beautiful bird that once lived quite wild in great numbers in  the United States. This bird has lovely soft feathers, which are pure  white; so it is called the _snowy egret_. The feathers are as soft as  silk. They are also long, with a gentle droop at the end.    Because these feathers are so lovely, rich women want to wear them in  their hats; and these rich women are willing to pay a great deal of  money for the egret feathers. So, for the sake of the money, hunters  go wherever these lovely birds are to be found, and catch and kill  them, and get the feathers. In fact, they have killed off so many of  these lovely birds, to get feathers for rich women's hats, that to-day  there are hardly any snowy egrets left in the United States.    Worse than that, the hunters killed the Papa and Mamma egrets just  when their babies were born, because at that time the feathers of the  snowy egrets were the softest and loveliest. And so, for each Papa and  Mamma egret which the cruel hunters killed, they left a dozen _baby  birds in their nests to starve and die_. Think of that!    Now, my dear children, I want the little girls among you to remember  this, especially the little girls who are lucky enough to have rich  Papas and Mammas. You can grow up to be beautiful, and look beautiful,  without wearing these egret feathers. There are women who try to look  beautiful, but who do not think of the pain they give to God's  innocent creatures.    So, if ever you want to wear egret feathers, think of the dozen baby  egrets who must starve and die if you are to have them.    [Illustration: Snowy Egrets  Photograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]          CHAPTER XVI    The Caged Parrot      I shall finish this book by telling you a story--a true story, which,  I hope, will make you think.    Many years ago a sea captain returned to his home in the north of  Scotland, after sailing the sea for a long time. He brought with him a  parrot. The parrot had lived in South America, where the people speak  the Spanish language. So all the words the parrot knew were in  Spanish.    The captain knew Spanish quite well, and often talked to the parrot in  that language. But after a time the captain died, and there was nobody  in that part of Scotland who could talk to the parrot.    The parrot grew silent, and never opened his mouth to say a word. But  he was thinking of his friend who was dead, and whose words in Spanish  had reminded him of his sunny home. The people around him did not know  that, and thought nothing of his silence. So the parrot in his cold  and bleak cage pined and pined for his sunny home land, but never a  word did he say.    Forty years passed, and a new set of people came to live there. They  took no notice of the silent old parrot. They put food and drink in  the cage, but knew nothing about him except that he had been in the  cage for many years. For a parrot lives much longer than a  man--sometimes one hundred years.    One day a sailor came to the house. He had lived in South America, and  knew Spanish. He saw the parrot sitting in his cage, all alone and  silent, with his head bent down, and his beak on his breast. Then the  sailor spoke to the parrot in Spanish.    The parrot looked up, as if he had awakened from a long, long dream.  Something reminded him of the days of his youth, when he was a happy  bird flying about over the sunny fields of South America. Then he  remembered the language of his youth, which he had not spoken for  forty years.    Suddenly he flapped his wings in joy, and spoke again. He spoke all  the Spanish words he knew, one after another. He spoke to that sailor  as to a friend come to him from his own home land. He flapped his  wings against the bars, and finally dropped to the floor of the cage,  dead. He had died in the thought of his bygone happy days.    My dear children, I am closing this book with this story, because I  want you to learn a great lesson from it: _be kind to all animals_.    I know that you would never willfully hurt any animal. But that is not  enough. You may think that you are very kind to some creature, because  you feed it and pet it; but all the same you may be very cruel, though  you do not mean to be so.    You may think it is great fun to have a pretty bird in a cage. But is  it any fun _for the bird_? How would _you_ like to be shut up in a  cage all your life, instead of playing about in God's free air and  living in your own home? The bird wants to fly about and live in his  nest in his own home land. Think of that when you wish to put a bird  in a cage.    Children who are kind to all animals grow up to be men and women who  are kind to other people. And it is only by being kind to others that  we ourselves _deserve_ to be happy and _are_ happy.    Remember all that I have said, till I come back and talk to you again  in the next book. Then I shall tell you many more Wonders of the  Jungle.    Till then, as they say in the Orient, God and His peace be with you!           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
