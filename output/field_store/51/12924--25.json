It gives one more the idea of what a Basilica was really  meant to be than any similar edifice in Rome. The richly painted panels,  the interior colonnade with its long harmonious rows of pillars, the  clerestory decorated _en suite_ with small pilasters and panels, and the  beautiful panelled roof, all combine to give the building an air of  lofty and noble magnificence. The high altar is very beautiful, with its  decorations of marble, gilding, and precious stones: it is also  interesting as possessing the crypt in which Pius IX. was interred. The  tombs of Sixtus V. and Pius V. are also here; and in contrast to the S.  Paolo Basilica, which has no side chapels at all, this church possesses  two very fine ones, the Borghese, and the Presigio, which are as rich in  ornamental work as the rest of the building. The latter contains the  supposititious cradle of our Lord; and the former has _in veritas_ the  beautiful tomb of a Borghese princess and high-born Englishwoman (Lady  Geraldine Talbot). The altar of the Virgin is supported by four pillars  of oriental jaspar, agate, and gilded bronze; the image, which is said  to have been the work of St. Luke(!), is richly adorned with precious  stones. The church itself abounds in beautiful pictures, statuary, and  tombs. The chapel of Santa Lucia is also very interesting, possessing  many beautiful tombs, bas-reliefs, etc.    The other church we visited, S. Pietro in Vincoli (St. Peter in Chains),  is considered the most ancient in Rome. It is a noble hall, supported by  twenty columns of Parian marble, and has many fine and interesting  monuments. It is always a debatable point this--St. Peter's presence in  Rome. We have no actual proof that he was ever there, and yet the great  number of places associated with his name and made sacred to his memory  seem to point strongly to such a supposition. Yet it may be only the  religious deceit of the priesthood, who thus couple persons and things  with places, and insert monstrous legends and traditions for their own  mercenary ends, and, considering the immense number of extraordinary  relics, it is very evident that Mr. Shapira has had many predecessors  in the art of manufacturing antiquities.    One of the most pleasing features of Rome is its numerous beautiful  fountains, generally to be found in the piazzas, sometimes surrounded by  fine architectural and sculptural groupings. It seems as if the great  men of every age in this city \"have found no better way of immortalizing  their memories than by the shifting, indestructible, ever-new,  ever-changing upgush and downfall of water. They have written their  names in that unstable element, and proved it a more durable record than  brass or marble.\"    The Fontana dell' Aqua Felice, near the baths of Diocletian, has a fine  statue of Moses striking the rock, by Prospero da Brescia, who is said  to have died of mortification at the ridicule excited by the figure of  the great lawgiver, in which a slight uncouthness is certainly  perceptible. The figures of Aaron and Gideon have been added to the  group by other artists. This fountain was celebrated by Tasso under the  name of the Fontana di Termini. The Fontana Paulina on the summit of the  Janiculum, near Porto S. Pancrazio, is like a triple triumphal arch. The  Fontana di Trevi, situated near the Palazzo Poli, is the most famous in  Rome. Its clear, sparkling water comes through the subterranean  aqueducts from far beyond the city walls. The design of the fountain is  by some sculptor of the Bernini school, and represents Neptune with his  attendant tritons, Health and Abundance. \"It is as magnificent a piece  of work as ever human skill contrived. At the foot of the palatial  facade is strewn, with careful art and ordered irregularity, a broad and  broken heap of massive rock, looking as if it might have lain there  since the deluge. Over a central precipice falls the water in a  semicircular cascade, and from a hundred crevices on all sides silvery  jets gush up, and streams spout out of the mouths and nostrils of stone  monsters, and fall in glistening drops; while other rivulets, that have  run wild, come leaping from one rude step to another, over stones that  are mossy, slimy, and green with sedge, because in a century of their  wild play, Nature has adopted the Fountain of Trevi, with all its  elaborate devices, for her own. Finally the water, tumbling, sparkling,  and dashing, with joyous haste and never-ceasing murmur, pours itself  into a great marble-brimmed reservoir, and fills it with a quivering  tide, on which is seen continually a snowy semicircle of momentary foam  from the principal cascade, as well as a multitude of snow points from  smaller jets. The basin occupies the whole breadth of the piazza, whence  flights of steps ascend to its border. A boat might float and make  voyages from one shore to another, in this mimic lake.\"    The great aqueducts, by which these fountains are supplied, are marvels  of ingenuity and engineering skill, sometimes bringing the pure crystal  stream from lakes and hills thirty and forty miles away. Dyer, the old  eighteenth-century poet, has a graceful mention of them in his \"Ruins of  Rome\":                             \"From yon blue hills      Dim in the clouds, the radiant aqueducts      Turn their innumerable arches o'er      The spacious desert, brightening in the sun,      Proud and more proud in their august approach;      High o'er irriguous vales and woods and towns,      Glide the soft whispering waters in the wind,      And more united pour their silver streams      Among the figur'd rocks in murmuring falls,      Musical ever.\"    These noble aqueducts were the chief source of Rome's health and luxury,  and were in charge of Curators or Prefects, who formed a kind of \"water  board.\" It is a system which might with great advantage be adopted by  our own large cities, which are lamentably wanting in a good and liberal  supply of fresh water--greedy monopolists charging what they choose, and  giving us the precious fluid clean or unclean, when or how they like.  The Government might do much to improve this state of things by  constructing aqueducts after the ancient Roman style.    Another marked feature in Roman life we are _not_ so anxious to see  imitated in our own country, is the abnormal quantity of beggars one  meets everywhere. They are of every sort and description, and swarm  round you wherever you go. Some of them a most pitiful and distressing  sight, only half clothed and seemingly starving. Their number is only  equalled by the legion of priests, who come upon you at every turn, in  all grades, from cardinals to novices. Of course, this is by no means to  be wondered at, Rome being the one great focus and clerical seminary of  the Roman Catholic world. But the contrast between the starving squalid  poor and the legions of well-fed priests is very painful.                                        CHAPTER XI.

We drove through a labyrinth of narrow, dirty, crowded streets, crossing  the Tiber by the fine bridge of St. Angelo. The picturesque castle of  this name was a very important fortress in the Middle Ages. It was  commenced by Hadrian, and afterwards finished as a family mausoleum by  Antoninus Pius, and must always possess a romantic interest from the  part it played in the life of that most whimsical and audacious of  autobiographers, Benvenuto Cellini. The account he gives of his escape  from its dungeons is quite Dumasesque in its thrilling details; and this  is not the only famous escape in the records of the fortress, Pope Paul  III., who was confined there in his youth, having succeeded in making a  secret exit.    Turning to the left through one of the narrow streets, we find ourselves  suddenly in a very fine piazza, before the largest Christian temple in  the world--colossal St Peter's. It stands proudly and grandly on the  Vatican Hill, on the site of the earliest Christian church, built by  Constantine the Great in the fourth century.    In the centre of the great piazza, which slopes upwards, is an ancient  Egyptian obelisk brought from the circus of Nero, and surrounded by  points of the compass let into the pavement. This is flanked by two  immense fountains, from which the water rises in a sparkling column to  the height of seventy feet. They are supplied by an aqueduct from Lake  Bramano, some seventeen miles distant.    St. Peter's is approached from the piazza, by a long-graduated series of  great steps. It is from the top of these that the Pope gives his  blessing at Easter to the multitude in the immense court below. The  piazza is environed by more than a thousand shops, which impede the  view, considerably foreshorten and hide the great dome of St. Peter's,  and detract from its imposing grandeur; causing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#19)"],[1,"long,  Spring's paramour, pours forth her song  The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,  And lo! where lies a marble tomb  And two old pines their branches spread--  \"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,  Who early died a gallant death_,\"  Thereon the passing traveller read:  \"_The date, his fleeting years how long--  Repose in peace, thou child of song_.\"    VII    Time was, the breath of early dawn  Would agitate a mystic wreath  Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn  Above the humble urn of death.  Time was, two maidens from their home  At eventide would hither come,  And, by the light the moonbeams gave,  Lament, embrace upon that grave.  But now--none heeds the monument  Of woe: effaced the pathway now:  There is no wreath upon the bough:  Alone beside it, gray and bent,  As formerly the shepherd sits  And his poor basten sandal knits.    VIII    My poor Vladimir, bitter tears  Thee but a little space bewept,  Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,  Nor true unto her sorrow kept.  Another could her heart engage,  Another could her woe assuage  By flattery and lover's art--  A lancer captivates her heart!  A lancer her soul dotes upon:  Before the altar, lo! the pair,  Mark ye with what a modest air  She bows her head beneath the crown;(68)  Behold her downcast eyes which glow,  Her lips where light smiles come and go!    [Note 68: The crown used in celebrating marriages in Russia  according to the forms of the Eastern Church. See Note 28.]    IX    My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,  Passed into dull eternity,  Was the sad poet filled with gloom,  Hearing the fatal perfidy?  Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,  Hath the bard, by indifference blest,  Callous to all on earth become--  Is the world to him sealed and dumb?  The same unmoved oblivion  On us beyond the grave attends,  The voice of lovers, foes and friends,  Dies suddenly: of heirs alone  Remains on earth the unseemly rage,  Whilst struggling for the heritage.    X    Soon Olga's accents shrill resound  No longer through her former home;  The lancer, to his calling bound,  Back to his regiment must roam.  The aged mother, bathed in tears,  Distracted by her grief appears  When the hour came to bid good-bye--  But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.  Only her countenance assumed  A deadly pallor, air distressed;  When all around the entrance pressed,  To say farewell, and fussed and fumed  Around the carriage of the pair--  Tattiana gently led them there.    XI    And long her eyes as through a haze  After the wedded couple strain;  Alas! the friend of childish days  Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.  Thy dove, thy darling little pet  On whom a sister's heart was set  Afar is borne by cruel fate,  For evermore is separate.  She wanders aimless as a sprite,  Into the tangled garden goes  But nowhere can she find repose,  Nor even tears afford respite,  Of consolation all bereft--  Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.    XII    In cruel solitude each day  With flame more ardent passion burns,  And to Oneguine far away  Her heart importunately turns.  She never more his face may view,  For was it not her duty to  Detest him for a brother slain?  The poet fell; already men  No more remembered him; unto  Another his betrothed was given;  The memory of the bard was driven  Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;  Two hearts perchance were desolate  And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?    XIII    'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds  In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.  Already dance to song proceeds;  The fisher's fire afar illumes  The river's bank. Tattiana lone  Beneath the silver of the moon  Long time in meditation deep  Her path across the plain doth keep--  Proceeds, until she from a hill  Sees where a noble mansion stood,  A village and beneath, a wood,  A garden by a shining rill.  She gazed thereon, and instant beat  Her heart more loudly and more fleet.    XIV    She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--  \"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?  He is not there: I am not known:  The house and garden I would see.\"  Tattiana from the hill descends  With bated breath, around she bends  A countenance perplexed and scared.  She enters a deserted yard--  Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,  But at her shriek ran forth with noise  The household troop of little boys,  Who with a scuffle and a shout  The curs away to kennel chase,  The damsel under escort place.    XV    \"Can I inspect the mansion, please?\"  Tattiana asks, and hurriedly  Unto Anicia for the keys  The family of children hie.  Anicia soon appears, the door  Opens unto her visitor.  Into the lonely house she went,  Wherein a space Oneguine spent.  She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,  Doth on the billiard table rest,  Upon the tumbled sofa placed,  A riding whip. She strolls along.  The beldam saith: \"The hearth, by it  The master always used to sit.    XVI    \"Departed Lenski here to dine  In winter time would often come.  Please follow this way, lady mine,  This is my master's sitting-room.  'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,  Into accounts would sometimes look,  A book at early morn perused.  The room my former master used.  On Sundays by yon window he,  Spectacles upon nose, all day  Was wont with me at cards to play.  God save his soul eternally  And grant his weary bones their rest  Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!\"    XVII    Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam  On everything around her gaze,  Of priceless value all things seem  And in her languid bosom raise  A pleasure though with sorrow knit:  The table with its lamp unlit,  The pile of books, with carpet spread  Beneath the window-sill his bed,  The landscape which the moonbeams fret,  The twilight pale which softens all,  Lord Byron's portrait on the wall  And the cast-iron statuette  With folded arms and eyes bent low,  Cocked hat and melancholy brow.(69)    [Note 69: The Russians not unfrequently adorn their apartments  with effigies of the great Napoleon.]    XVIII    Long in this fashionable cell  Tattiana as enchanted stood;  But it grew late; cold blew the gale;  Dark was the valley and the wood  slept o'er the river misty grown.  Behind the mountain sank the moon.  Long, long the hour had past when home  Our youthful wanderer should roam.  She hid the trouble of her breast,  Heaved an involuntary sigh  And turned to leave immediately,  But first permission did request  Thither in future to proceed  That certain volumes she might read.    XIX    Adieu she to the matron said  At the front gates, but in brief space  At early morn returns the maid  To the abandoned dwelling-place.  When in the study's calm retreat,  Wrapt in oblivion complete,  She found herself alone at last,  Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;  But presently she tried to read;  At first for books was disinclined,  But soon their choice seemed to her mind  Remarkable. She then indeed  Devoured them with an eager zest.  A new world was made manifest!    XX    Although we know that Eugene had  Long ceased to be a reading man,  Still certain authors, I may add,  He had excepted from the ban:  The bard of Juan and the Giaour,  With it may be a couple more;  Romances three, in which ye scan  Portrayed contemporary man  As the reflection of his age,  His immorality of mind  To arid selfishness resigned,  A visionary personage  With his exasperated sense,  His energy and impotence.    XXI    And numerous pages had preserved  The sharp incisions of his nail,  And these the attentive maid observed  With eye precise and without fail.  Tattiana saw with trepidation  By what idea or observation  Oneguine was the most impressed,  In what he merely acquiesced.  Upon those margins she perceived  Oneguine's pencillings. His mind  Made revelations undesigned,  Of what he thought and what believed,  A dagger, asterisk, or note  Interrogation to denote.    XXII    And my Tattiana now began  To understand by slow degrees  More clearly, God be praised, the man,  Whom autocratic fate's decrees  Had bid her sigh for without hope--  A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,  Being from hell or heaven sent,  Angel or fiend malevolent.  Which is he? or an imitation,  A bogy conjured up in joke,  A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,  Of foreign whims the impersonation--  Handbook of fashionable phrase  Or parody of modern ways?    XXIII    Hath she found out the riddle yet?  Hath she a fitting phrase selected?  But time flies and she doth forget  They long at home have her expected--  Whither two neighbouring dames have walked  And a long time about her talked.  \"What can be done? She is no child!\"  Cried the old dame with anguish filled:  \"Olinka is her junior, see.  'Tis time to many her, 'tis true,  But tell me what am I to do?  To all she answers cruelly--  I will not wed, and ever weeps  And lonely through the forest creeps.\"    XXIV    \"Is she in love?\" quoth one. \"With whom?  Bouyanoff courted. She refused.  Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.  The hussar Pikhtin was accused.  How the young imp on Tania doted!  To captivate her how devoted!  I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--  O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.\"  \"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you(70)  Should go, the market for a maid,  With many a vacancy, 'tis said.\"--  \"Alas! my friend, no revenue!\"  \"Enough to see one winter's end;  If not, the money I will lend.\"    [Note 70: \"Matushka,\" or \"little mother,\" a term of endearment  in constant use amongst Russian females.]    XXV    The venerable dame opined  The counsel good and full of reason,  Her money counted, and designed  To visit Moscow in the season.  Tattiana learns the intelligence--  Of her provincial innocence  The unaffected traits she now  Unto a carping world must show--  Her toilette's antiquated style,  Her antiquated mode of speech,  For Moscow fops and Circes each  To mark with a contemptuous smile.  Horror! had she not better stay  Deep in the greenwood far away?    XXVI    Arising with the morning's light,  Unto the fields she makes her way,  And with emotional delight"]]]
