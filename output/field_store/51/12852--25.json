He is sure of getting his stripes in a couple of years  after enlisting. A non-commissioned officer has enough pay to live  comfortably; he has no care or anxiety of any sort; he has more time to  himself than a man in any other sort of business. There are no end of  staff appointments open to him if he writes a good hand, and does not  mind clerk work. If he goes in for long service he has every chance of  being regimental sergeant-major before he has done, and can leave the  service with a pension sufficient to keep him in a quiet way.\"    \"Yes, that is all very well, Summers, but he cannot marry. That is to  say, if he has, as we are supposing, been born and educated as a  gentleman, he cannot marry the sort of woman he would like as a wife.\"    \"No, there is that drawback,\" the other laughed. \"But then, you see, if  he had been obliged to take a small clerkship leading to nothing, he  could hardly invite a young countess to share it with him.\"    As Edgar walked back to barracks he thought over the advice that had  been given him, and recognized its value. He knew that the chances of  his ever obtaining a commission were exceedingly small, and that even  young men whose fathers were officers of high standing and considerable  influence seldom obtain a commission under six or seven years' service,  and that the majority of commissions from the ranks are given to old  non-commissioned officers who were made quarter-masters or pay-masters.  He had not entered the service, as had the two non-commissioned officers  with whom he had been speaking, for the express purpose of gaining a  commission, but simply because he had always had a fancy for soldiering,  and because it seemed at the time he left Cheltenham the only thing open  to him.    He had resolved from the first that he would regularly put by a portion  of his pay, so that he could at any time purchase his discharge if he  wished to, should he see any opening in which he could embark by the  time he reached the age of three or four and twenty. He would have  gained experience, and might then, if he liked, emigrate to one of the  colonies. He resolved that when winter came he would go into one of the  regimental workshops and learn a trade, either saddlery or farriery,  which would enable him to earn his living for a time abroad until he saw  something better to do. At school Edgar had held his place rather by  steady work than by natural talent. Rupert was the more clever of the  two, but Edgar's dogged perseverance had placed him in a more advanced  position on the modern side than Rupert held on the classical, and in  whatever position he might find himself his perseverance, power of work,  and strong common sense were likely to carry him through.    Edgar was conscious himself that he had acted hastily and wrongly in  leaving Cheltenham as he had done, and yet he felt that if again placed  in the same circumstances he should do the same. Captain Clinton had  certainly a right to have a voice in his future, and yet he felt so  keenly the dishonour of the fraud in which he had been an unconscious  accomplice, that he could not have brought himself to accept any  assistance at Captain Clinton's hands. Still he knew that those at  home--for he still thought of it as home--would be feeling much anxiety  about him, and once a month he wrote a short letter to Captain Clinton  saying that he was well and was keeping himself comfortably. These  letters he gave in charge of comrades going up for a day's leave to  London to post there for him.    One day Edgar had gone with a dozen others to bathe in the canal. After  doing so they had returned to barracks, and he had gone for a walk by  himself. On his return he was walking along a lane at a distance of  about a mile from the town, when he heard a scream. He at once started  off at the top of his speed, and at a turn of the lane he came upon a  group of two tramps and two frightened ladies. One of these was in the  act of handing over her purse to a tramp, while the second man was  holding the other by the wrist, and was endeavouring to tear off her  watch and chain, which she was struggling to retain. Just as Edgar  turned the corner he struck her on the face, and she fell backward on to  the bank.    Another moment and Edgar was up to them. The tramp turned with a savage  oath. Edgar, who was carrying his riding-whip, struck him with it with  all his strength across the eyes, and the man staggered back with a  shriek of pain. The other stood on the defensive, but he was no match  for Edgar, who was in hard exercise, and in regular practice with the  gloves, and whose blood was thoroughly up. The fight lasted but a  minute, at the end of which time the tramp was lying in the road roaring  for mercy, and shouting to his comrade to come to his assistance.    The latter, however, was stamping with pain, and was still unable to use  his eyes.    Edgar turned to the ladies. \"If you will kindly walk on to the town,\" he  said, \"and send the first man you meet here to me, I will take care of  these two fellows until he arrives, and then we will hand them over to  the police. Do not be alarmed,\" he went on, seeing that they hesitated,  \"I think they have had enough of it.\"    [Illustration: \"EDGAR STRUCK HIM WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH.\"]    The ladies hurried off, and before going many hundred yards came upon  three infantry men, who, when they heard what had happened, set off at a  run to Edgar's assistance. They arrived just in time. The man on the  ground had recovered his feet, and he and his companion had attacked  Edgar with fury, and it needed all the latter's skill and activity to  defend himself. As soon as the soldiers arrived upon the scene the  combat ceased. As a measure of precaution the tramps were first knocked  down; they were then dragged on to their feet and conducted by their  captors into Aldershot, where they were lodged at the police station.  They were followed by the two ladies, who after sending on the  soldiers had waited until their return with the tramps. They waited  outside the police station until a constable came out and asked them to  sign the charge sheet, which they did. Edgar now looked at them fairly  for the first time, and recognized one of them as being the wife of the  major of his corps.    \"You belong to my husband's regiment,\" she said as they came out from  the police station. \"What is your name?\"    \"Smith, madam. I am a trumpeter in D troop.\"    \"Oh, yes! I remember your face now. I have often seen you in the cricket  field. Miss Pearson and myself are greatly indebted to you. I should not  mind so much being robbed of my purse, but I prize my watch very highly  as it was a present from my father. Major Horsley will see you and thank  you when he hears what you have done.\"    \"I do not want any thanks,\" Edgar said; \"it is a pleasure to punish such  ruffians.\"    Half an hour later Major Horsley came across to Edgar's quarters, and  the sergeant called the lad down.    \"I am greatly indebted to you, Smith,\" he said, as Edgar saluted,  \"greatly indebted to you. You have behaved most gallantly, and have  saved my wife from the loss of her watch and chain that she greatly  valued, and perhaps from serious ill-treatment from those ruffians; as  it was, one of them struck her a very severe blow on the face. I know  enough of you, lad, to feel that I cannot offer you money for the  service that you have rendered me; but be assured that I shall not  forget it, and that when it is in my power to do you a good turn I will  do so.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" Edgar said. \"I am very glad to have been of service.\"    The major nodded kindly. Edgar saluted and turned away, well pleased at  having made a friend who would have it in his power to be so useful to  him, and still more pleased that the major had not offered him money as  a reward for what he had done. An hour later he was sent for to the  orderly-room, where the colonel in the presence of several of the  officers thanked him for his gallant conduct.    \"You are a credit to the regiment, Smith; and you may be sure that I  shall keep my eye on you,\" he concluded.    The next day the tramps were brought up before the local magistrates and  committed for trial for highway robbery with violence, and a month later  they were brought up at the assizes at Winchester and sentenced to five  years' penal servitude. Edgar gained a great deal of credit in the  regiment from the affair, and came to be known by the nickname of \"The  Bantam.\" There were, of course, some men who were jealous of the young  trumpeter's popularity, and two or three of the non-commissioned  officers especially felt aggrieved at the notice taken of him. One of  these was the corporal in charge of the barrack-room occupied by Edgar,  for he had, since he had been regularly appointed to a troop, left the  quarters he first occupied with the band for those allotted to troop D.    Corporals, however, have but little power in a barrack-room. They are in  a sort of transitional state between a private and a sergeant, and are  liable for even a comparatively small fault to be sent down again into  the ranks. This being the case, they seldom venture to make themselves  obnoxious to the men who were but lately their comrades, and may be  their comrades again before a week is out. Corporal North, however, lost  no opportunity of making himself disagreeable in a small way to Edgar.  More than that he could not venture upon, for the men would at once have  taken the lad's part.    The regiment had been for some little time first on the list for foreign  service, and there was no surprise when the news ran round the  barrack-rooms that the order had come to prepare for embarkation. It was  supposed that as a matter of course"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,". The adoption of Gond names and septs appears to  indicate that Gonds were in former times freely admitted into the Baiga  tribe; and this continues to be the case at present among the lower  subtribes, so far that a Gond girl marrying a Baiga becomes a regular  member of the community. But the Binjhwars and Bharotias, who have  a somewhat higher status than the others, refuse to admit Gonds, and  are gradually adopting the strict rule of endogamy within the subtribe.        4. Marriage.      A Baiga must not take a wife from his own sept or from another one  worshipping the same number of gods. But he may marry within his  mother's sept, and in some localities the union of first cousins is  permitted. Marriage is adult and the proposal comes from the parents of  the bride, but in some places the girl is allowed to select a husband  for herself. A price varying from five to twenty rupees is usually  paid to the bride's parents, or in lieu of this the prospective  husband serves his father-in-law for a period of about two years,  the marriage being celebrated after the first year if his conduct  is satisfactory. Orphan boys who have no parents to arrange their  marriages for them often take service for a wife. Three ceremonies  should precede the marriage. The first, which may take place at  any time after the birth of both children, consists merely in the  arrangement for their betrothal. The second is only a ratification  of the first, feasts being provided by the boy's parents on both  occasions. While on the approach of the children to marriageable age  the final betrothal or _barokhi_ is held. The boy's father gives a  large feast at the house of the girl and the date of the wedding is  fixed. To ascertain whether the union will be auspicious, two grains  of rice are dropped into a pot of water, after various preliminary  solemnities to mark the importance of the occasion. If the points  of the grains meet almost immediately it is considered that the  marriage will be highly auspicious. If they do not meet, a second  pair of grains are dropped in, and should these meet it is believed  that the couple will quarrel after an interval of married life and  that the wife will return to her father's house. While if neither  of the two first essays are successful and a third pair is required,  the regrettable conclusion is arrived at that the wife will run away  with another man after a very short stay with her husband. But it  is not stated that the betrothal is on that account annulled. The  wedding procession starts from the bridegroom's house [90] and is  received by the bride's father outside the village. It is considered  essential that he should go out to meet the bride's party riding on an  elephant. But as a real elephant is not within the means of a Baiga,  two wooden bedsteads are lashed together and covered with blankets with  a black cloth trunk in front, and this arrangement passes muster for  an elephant. The elephant makes pretence to charge and trample down  the marriage procession, until a rupee is paid, when the two parties  embrace each other and proceed to the marriage-shed. Here the bride  and bridegroom throw fried rice at each other until they are tired,  and then walk three or seven times round the marriage-post with their  clothes tied together. It is stated by Colonel Ward that the couple  always retired to the forest to spend the wedding night, but this  custom has now been abandoned. The expenditure on a marriage varies  between ten and fifty rupees, of which only about five rupees fall  on the bride's parents. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and  the widow is expected, though not obliged, to wed her late husband's  younger brother, while if she takes another husband he must pay her  brother-in-law the sum of five rupees. The ceremony consists merely of  the presentation of bangles and new clothes by the suitor, in token  of her acceptance of which the widow pours some tepid water stained  with turmeric over his head. Divorce may be effected by the husband  and wife breaking a straw in the presence of the caste _panchayat_  or committee. If the woman remains in the same village and does  not marry again, the husband is responsible for her maintenance and  that of her children, while a divorced woman may not remarry without  the sanction of the _panchayat_ so long as her husband is alive and  remains single. Polygamy is permitted.        5. Birth and funeral rites.      A woman is unclean for a month after childbirth, though the Binjhwars  restrict the period to eight days. At the ceremony of purification a  feast is given and the child is named, often after the month or day  of its birth, as Chaitu, Phagu, Saoni, and so on, from the months  of Chait, Phagun and Shrawan. Children who appear to be physically  defective are given names accordingly, such as Langra (lame), or Bahira  (deaf). The dead are usually buried, the bodies of old persons being  burnt as a special honour and to save them from the risk of being  devoured by wild animals. Bodies are laid naked in the grave with the  head pointing to the south. In the grave of a man of importance two  or three rupees and some tobacco are placed. In some places a rupee  is thrust into the mouth of the dying man, and if his body is burnt,  the coin is recovered from the pyre by his daughter or sister, who  wears it as an amulet. Over the grave a platform is made on which  a stone is erected. This is called the Bhiri of the deceased and is  worshipped by his relatives in time of trouble. If one of the family  has to be buried elsewhere, the relatives go to the Bhiri of the  great dead and consign his spirit to be kept in their company. At a  funeral the mourners take one black and one white fowl to a stream  and kill and eat them there, setting aside a portion for the dead  man. Mourning is observed for a period of from two to nine days,  and during this time labour and even household work are stopped, food  being supplied by the friends of the family. When a man is killed by  a tiger the Baiga priest goes to the spot and there makes a small  cone out of the blood-stained earth. This must represent a man,  either the dead man or one of his living relatives. His companions  having retired a few paces, the priest goes on his hands and knees  and performs a series of antics which are supposed to represent the  tiger in the act of destroying the man, at the same time seizing the  lump of blood-stained earth in his teeth. One of the party then runs  up and taps him on the back with a small stick. This perhaps means  that the tiger is killed or otherwise rendered harmless; and the  Baiga immediately lets the mud cone fall into the hands of one of the  party. It is then placed in an ant-hill and a pig is sacrificed over  it. The next day a small chicken is taken to the place, and after  a mark supposed to be the dead man's name is made on its head with  red ochre, it is thrown back into the forest, the priest exclaiming,  'Take this and go home.' The ceremony is supposed to lay the dead  man's spirit and at the same time to prevent the tiger from doing  any further damage. The Baigas believe that the ghost of the victim,  if not charmed to rest, resides on the head of the tiger and incites  him to further deeds of blood, rendering him also secure from harm  by his preternatural watchfulness. [91]    They also think that they can shut up the tiger's _dar_ or jaws,  so that he cannot bite them, by driving a nail into a tree. The  forest track from Kanha to Kisli in the Banjar forest reserve of  Mandla was formerly a haunt of man-eating tigers, to whom a number  of the wood-cutters and Baiga coolies, clearing the jungle paths,  fell victims every year. In a large tree, at a dangerous point in the  track, there could recently be seen a nail, driven into the trunk by  a Baiga priest, at some height from the ground. It was said that this  nail shut the mouth of a famous man-eating tiger of the locality and  prevented him from killing any more victims. As evidence of the truth  of the story there were shown on the trunk the marks of the tiger's  claws, where he had been jumping up the tree in the effort to pull  the nail out of the trunk and get his man-eating powers restored.        6. Religion.      Although the Binjhwar subcaste now profess Hinduism, the religion of  the Baigas is purely animistic. Their principal deity is Bura Deo, [92]  who is supposed to reside in a _saj_ tree (_Terminalia tomentosa_); he  is worshipped in the month of Jeth (May), when goats, fowls, cocoanuts,  and the liquor of the new mahua crop are offered to him. Thakur Deo  is the god of the village land and boundaries, and is propitiated  with a white goat. The Baigas who plough the fields have a ceremony  called Bidri, which is performed before the breaking of the rains. A  handful of each kind of grain sown is given by each cultivator to the  priest, who mixes the grains together and sows a little beneath the  tree where Thakur Deo lives. After this he returns a little to each  cultivator, and he sows it in the centre of the land on which crops  are to be grown, while the priest keeps the remainder. This ceremony  is believed to secure the success of the harvest. Dulha Deo is the  god who averts disease and accident, and the offering made to him  should consist of a fowl or goat of reddish colour. Bhimsen is the  deity of rainfall, and Dharti Mata or Mother Earth is considered to be  the wife of Thakur Deo, and must also be propitiated for the success  of the crops. The grain itself is worshipped at the threshing floor  by sprinkling water and liquor on to it. Certain Hindu deities are  also worshipped by the Baigas, but not in orthodox fashion. Thus it  would be sacrilege on the part of a Hindu to offer animal sacrifices  to Narayan Deo, the sun-god, but the Baigas devote to him a special  oblation of the most unclean animal, the pig.
