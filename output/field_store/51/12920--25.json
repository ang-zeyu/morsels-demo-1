The mansion house--or \"big house,\" as  it would have been called--which had been occupied by the owners during  slavery, had been burned. After making a careful examination of the  place, it seemed to be just the location that we wanted in order to make  our work effective and permanent.    But how were we to get it? The price asked for it was very little--only  five hundred dollars--but we had no money, and we were strangers in the  town and had no credit. The owner of the land agreed to let us occupy  the place if we could make a payment of two hundred and fifty dollars  down, with the understanding that the remaining two hundred and fifty  dollars must be paid within a year. Although five hundred dollars was  cheap for the land, it was a large sum when one did not have any part of  it.    In the midst of the difficulty I summoned a great deal of courage and  wrote to my friend General J.F.B. Marshall, the Treasurer of the Hampton  Institute, putting the situation before him and beseeching him to lend  me the two hundred and fifty dollars on my own personal responsibility.  Within a few days a reply came to the effect that he had no authority to  lend me the money belonging to the Hampton Institute, but that he would  gladly lend me the amount needed from his own personal funds.    I confess that the securing of this money in this way was a great  surprise to me, as well as a source of gratification. Up to that time I  never had had in my possession so much money as one hundred dollars at  a time, and the loan which I had asked General Marshall for seemed a  tremendously large sum to me. The fact of my being responsible for the  repaying of such a large amount of money weighed very heavily upon me.    I lost no time in getting ready to move the school on to the new farm.  At the time we occupied the place there were standing upon it a cabin,  formerly used as a dining room, an old kitchen, a stable, and an old  hen-house. Within a few weeks we had all of these structures in use. The  stable was repaired and used as a recitation-room, and very presently  the hen-house was utilized for the same purpose.    I recall that one morning, when I told an old coloured man who lived  near, and who sometimes helped me, that our school had grown so large  that it would be necessary for us to use the hen-house for school  purposes, and that I wanted him to help me give it a thorough cleaning  out the next day, he replied, in the most earnest manner: \"What  you mean, boss? You sholy ain't gwine clean out de hen-house in de  day-time?\"    Nearly all the work of getting the new location ready for school  purposes was done by the students after school was over in the  afternoon. As soon as we got the cabins in condition to be used, I  determined to clear up some land so that we could plant a crop. When I  explained my plan to the young men, I noticed that they did not seem  to take to it very kindly. It was hard for them to see the connection  between clearing land and an education. Besides, many of them had been  school-teachers, and they questioned whether or not clearing land would  be in keeping with their dignity. In order to relieve them from any  embarrassment, each afternoon after school I took my axe and led the way  to the woods. When they saw that I was not afraid or ashamed to work,  they began to assist with more enthusiasm. We kept at the work each  afternoon, until we had cleared about twenty acres and had planted a  crop.    In the meantime Miss Davidson was devising plans to repay the loan. Her  first effort was made by holding festivals, or \"suppers.\" She made a  personal canvass among the white and coloured families in the town  of Tuskegee, and got them to agree to give something, like a cake, a  chicken, bread, or pies, that could be sold at the festival. Of course  the coloured people were glad to give anything that they could spare,  but I want to add that Miss Davidson did not apply to a single white  family, so far as I now remember, that failed to donate something; and  in many ways the white families showed their interest in the school.    Several of these festivals were held, and quite a little sum of money  was raised. A canvass was also made among the people of both races for  direct gifts of money, and most of those applied to gave small sums. It  was often pathetic to note the gifts of the older coloured people, most  of whom had spent their best days in slavery. Sometimes they would give  five cents, sometimes twenty-five cents. Sometimes the contribution was  a quilt, or a quantity of sugarcane. I recall one old coloured women who  was about seventy years of age, who came to see me when we were raising  money to pay for the farm. She hobbled into the room where I was,  leaning on a cane. She was clad in rags; but they were clean. She said:  \"Mr. Washin'ton, God knows I spent de bes' days of my life in slavery.  God knows I's ignorant an' poor; but,\" she added, \"I knows what you an'  Miss Davidson is tryin' to do. I knows you is tryin' to make better men  an' better women for de coloured race. I ain't got no money, but I wants  you to take dese six eggs, what I's been savin' up, an' I wants you to  put dese six eggs into the eddication of dese boys an' gals.\"    Since the work at Tuskegee started, it has been my privilege to receive  many gifts for the benefit of the institution, but never any, I think,  that touched me so deeply as this one.        Chapter IX. Anxious Days And Sleepless Nights    The coming of Christmas, that first year of our residence in Alabama,  gave us an opportunity to get a farther insight into the real life of  the people. The first thing that reminded us that Christmas had arrived  was the \"foreday\" visits of scores of children rapping at our doors,  asking for \"Chris'mus gifts! Chris'mus gifts!\" Between the hours of two  o'clock and five o'clock in the morning I presume that we must have had  a half-hundred such calls. This custom prevails throughout this portion  of the South to-day.    During the days of slavery it was a custom quite generally observed  throughout all the Southern states to give the coloured people a week of  holiday at Christmas, or to allow the holiday to continue as long as the  \"yule log\" lasted. The male members of the race, and often the female  members, were expected to get drunk. We found that for a whole week  the coloured people in and around Tuskegee dropped work the day before  Christmas, and that it was difficult for any one to perform any service  from the time they stopped work until after the New Year. Persons who at  other times did not use strong drink thought it quite the proper thing  to indulge in it rather freely during the Christmas week. There was  a widespread hilarity, and a free use of guns, pistols, and gunpowder  generally. The sacredness of the season seemed to have been almost  wholly lost sight of.    During this first Christmas vacation I went some distance from the town  to visit the people on one of the large plantations. In their poverty  and ignorance it was pathetic to see their attempts to get joy out of  the season that in most parts of the country is so sacred and so dear to  the heart. In one cabin I notice that all that the five children had to  remind them of the coming of Christ was a single bunch of firecrackers,  which they had divided among them. In another cabin, where there were  at least a half-dozen persons, they had only ten cents' worth of  ginger-cakes, which had been bought in the store the day before. In  another family they had only a few pieces of sugarcane. In still another  cabin I found nothing but a new jug of cheap, mean whiskey, which the  husband and wife were making free use of, notwithstanding the fact that  the husband was one of the local ministers. In a few instances I found  that the people had gotten hold of some bright-coloured cards that had  been designed for advertising purposes, and were making the most of  these. In other homes some member of the family had bought a new pistol.  In the majority of cases there was nothing to be seen in the cabin to  remind one of the coming of the Saviour, except that the people had  ceased work in the fields and were lounging about their homes. At night,  during Christmas week, they usually had what they called a \"frolic,\" in  some cabin on the plantation. That meant a kind of rough dance, where  there was likely to be a good deal of whiskey used, and where there  might be some shooting or cutting with razors.    While I was making this Christmas visit I met an old coloured man who  was one of the numerous local preachers, who tried to convince me, from  the experience Adam had in the Garden of Eden, that God had cursed all  labour, and that, therefore, it was a sin for any man to work. For that  reason this man sought to do as little work as possible. He seemed at  that time to be supremely happy, because he was living, as he expressed  it, through one week that was free from sin.    In the school we made a special effort to teach our students the meaning  of Christmas, and to give them lessons in its proper observance. In this  we have been successful to a degree that makes me feel safe in saying  that the season now has a new meaning, not only through all that  immediate region, but, in a measure, wherever our graduates have gone.    At the present time one of the most satisfactory features of the  Christmas and Thanksgiving season at Tuskegee is the unselfish and  beautiful way in which our graduates and students spend their time in  administering to the comfort and happiness of others, especially the  unfortunate. Not long ago some of our young men spent a holiday  in rebuilding a cabin for a helpless coloured women who was about  seventy-five years old. At another time I remember that I made it known  in chapel, one night, that a very poor student was suffering from cold,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#19)"],[1,"the music has been so well managed that the danger of such a  repetition is turned into grim force. The only prelude is five great  blasts of the horns. A brawny vigor is got by a frequent use of  imitation and unison in the voices. The choric work is marked  throughout with the most intense and epic power, almost savagery; a  magnificent martial zest. The climax is big. It is certainly one of  the best things of its kind ever done over here.    Another work of fine quality throughout is \"A Christmas Idyl,\" for  solos, chorus, and orchestra. A terrible sombreness is achieved in its  former half by a notable simplicity. The latter part is in brighter  tone; the solo, \"And Thou, Bethlehem,\" is especially exultant. In  manuscript is \"An Easter Idyl,\" of large proportions, for solos,  chorus, and orchestra, or organ.    In the single songs the influence of Gilchrist's early training in  hymns is patent. In only a few instances do they follow the latter-day  methods of Schumann and Franz. \"A Song of Doubt and a Song of Faith\"  is possibly his best vocal solo. It begins with a plaint, that is full  of cynic despair; thence it breaks suddenly into a cheerful andante.  \"The Two Villages\" is a strong piece of work on the conventional  lines of what might be called the Sunday ballad. \"A Dirge for Summer\"  has a marked originality, and is of that deep brooding which is  particularly congenial to Gilchrist's muse. The Scotch songs are  charming: \"My Heart is Sair\" is full of fine feeling, and must be  classed among the very best of the many settings of this lyric of  Burns'.    Most modern in feeling of all Gilchrist's vocal solos is the group of  \"Eight Songs.\" They interpret the text faithfully and the  accompaniment is in accord with the song, but yet possessed of its own  individuality. \"A Love Song\" is tender and has a well-woven  accompaniment; \"The Voice of the Sea\" is effective, but hardly attains  the large simplicity of Aldrich' poem; \"Autumn\" is exquisitely cheery;  \"Goldenrod\" is ornately graceful, while \"The Dear Long Ago\" is quaint;  \"Lullaby\" is of an exquisitely novel rhythm in this overworked form.    [Music: A LOVE SONG.    By Barry Cornwall.    Music by W.W. Gilchrist.        Love me if I live,      Love me if I die.      What to me is life or death,      So that thou, that thou be near.      What to me is life or death,      So that thou be near,      So that thou be near.    Copyright, 1885, by Arthur P. Schmidt & Co.    A FRAGMENT.]    There is much contrast between the lightness of his book, \"Songs for  the Children,\" and his ponderous setting of Kipling's \"Recessional.\"  The treatment of Paul Laurence Dunbar's \"Southern Lullaby\" is unusual,  and the songs, \"My Ladye\" and \"The Ideal,\" both in MS., are  noteworthy.    Gilchrist has written a vast amount of religious music, including  several \"Te Deums,\" of which the one in C and that in A flat are the  best, to my thinking. He has written little for the piano except a  series of duets, of which the charming \"Melodie\" and the fetching  \"Styrienne\" are the best.    It is by his orchestral works, however, that he gains the highest  consideration. These include a symphony for full orchestra, which has  been frequently performed with success; a suite for orchestra; a suite  for piano and orchestra; as well as a nonet, a quintet, and a trio,  for strings and wind. None of these have been published, but I have  had the privilege of examining some of the manuscripts.    The spirit and the treatment of these works is strongly classical.  While the orchestration is scholarly and mellow, it is not in the  least Wagnerian, either in manipulation or in lusciousness. The  symphony is not at all programmatic. The Scherzo is of most exuberant  gaiety. Its accentuation is much like that in Beethoven's piano  sonata (op. 14, No. 2). Imitation is liberally used in the scoring,  with a delightfully comic effect as of an altercation. The symphony  ends with a dashing finale that is stormy with cheer. Gilchrist is at  work upon a second symphony of more modernity.    The \"Nonet\" is in G minor, and begins with an Allegro in which a most  original and severe subject is developed with infinite grace and  an unusually rich color. The Andante is religioso, and is fervent  rather than sombre. The ending is especially beautiful. A sprightly  Scherzo follows. It is most ingeniously contrived, and the effects are  divided with unusual impartiality among the instruments. A curious and  elaborate allegro molto furnishes the finale, and ends the \"Nonet\"  surprisingly with an abrupt major chord.    The opening Allegro of the \"Quintet\" begins with a 'cello solo of  scherzesque quality, but as the other voices join in, it takes on a  more passionate tone, whence it works into rapturously beautiful moods  and ends magnificently. The piano part has a strong value, and even  where it merely ornaments the theme carried by the strings, it is  fascinating. The Scherzo is again of the Beethoven order in its  contagious comicality. The piano has the lion's share of it at first,  but toward the last the other instruments leave off embroidery and  take to cracking jokes for themselves. The Andante is a genuinely fine  piece of work. It ranges from melting tenderness to impassioned rage  and a purified nobility. The piano part is highly elaborated, but the  other instruments have a scholarly, a vocal, individuality. I was  shocked to see a cadenza for the piano just before the close, but its  tender brilliance was in thorough accord with the sincerity of the  movement. The \"Quintet\" ends with a splendid Allegro.    In MS. are three interesting works for the violin, a Rhapsody, a  Perpetual Motion, and a Fantasie.    This last has a piano accompaniment of much ingenuity. The fantasial  nature of the work lies principally in its development, which is  remarkably lyrical, various melodies being built up beautifully on  fractions of the main subjects. There is nothing perfunctory, and the  work is full of art and appeal. Gilchrist is one of our most polished  composers contrapuntally, but has been here in a very lyric mood.    He is the founder and conductor of the Mendelssohn Club of  Philadelphia, an unusually effective organization; one of the founders  of the local Manuscript Club; the conductor of a choral society of two  hundred voices, at Harrisburg, and the director of two church choirs.      _G.W. Chadwick._    [Illustration: Autograph of G.W. Chadwick]    [Illustration: GEORGE WHITEFIELD CHADWICK.]    One of the most sophisticated, and, at the same time, most eclectic of  native music-makers, is George W. Chadwick, to whom the general  consent of authorities would grant a place among the very foremost of  the foremost American composers.    His reputation rests chiefly on his two symphonies, a number of  concert overtures, and many pieces of chamber-music, which are much  praised. Chadwick was born at Lowell, Mass., November 13, 1854. His  parents were American, and it was not till 1877, after studying with  Eugene Thayer in Boston, and teaching music in the college at Olivet,  Mich., that Chadwick studied for two years at Leipzig, under Jadassohn  and Reinecke, and later at Munich for a year under Rheinberger. In  1880 he returned to America and settled in Boston, where he has since  lived, as organist, teacher, and conductor, an important figure in  the town's musical life.    Among his few works for the piano, are \"Six Characteristic Pieces\"  (op. 7). The \"Reminiscence of Chopin\" is an interesting and skilful  chain of partial themes and suggestions from Chopin. The \"Etude\" is a  monotonous study in a somewhat Schumannesque manner, with a graceful  finish. The \"Congratulation\" is a cheerful bagatelle; the \"Irish  Melody\" is sturdy, simple, and fetching; but the \"Scherzino\" is a hard  bit of humor with Beethoven mannerisms lacking all the master's  unction.    The opus ends with an unfortunate composition inexcusably titled  \"Please Do!\"    There are two bright \"Caprices\" and three excellent waltzes, of which  the third is the best. It is a dreamy, tender work on a theme by  \"B.J.L.,\" which refers, I presume, to Mr. B.J. Lang.    Chadwick has done a vast amount of part-song writing. His \"Lovely  Rosabelle\" is for chorus and orchestra, and is marked with many  original effects. His \"Reiterlied\" is superbly joyful. A setting of  Lewis Carroll's immortal \"Jabberwocky\" shows much rich humor of the  college glee-club sort. There is an irresistibly humorous episode  where the instrument of destruction goes \"snicker snack,\" and a fine  hilarity at        \"'O frabjous day      Callooh, callay,'      He chortled in his joy.\"    What would part-song writers do if the Vikings had never been  invented? Where would they get their wild choruses for men, with a  prize to the singer that makes the most noise? Chadwick falls into  line with \"The Viking's Last Voyage\" (1881), for barytone solo, male  chorus, and orchestra, which gives him a very high place among writers  in this form. He has also a robustious \"Song of the Viking,\" and an  excellent Dedication Ode (1884), for solo, chorus, and orchestra, to  the pregnant words of Rev. H.B. Carpenter, besides two cantatas for  mixed voices, \"Phoenix Expirans\" and \"The Pilgrims.\" In 1889 was  published his \"Lovely Rosabelle,\" a ballad for chorus and orchestra;  it contains some interesting dissonantial work in the storm-passages.  And his comic opera, \"Tabasco,\" must be mentioned, as well as an  enormous mass of sacred music, which, I confess, I had not the  patience to study. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was weak.    Among Chadwick's songs is a volume of Breton melodies harmonized with  extreme simplicity. Others are \"Gay Little Dandelion,\" which is good  enough of its everlasting flower-song sort; \"In Bygone Days\" and  \"Request,\" which, aside from one or two flecks of art, are trashy; and  two childish namby-pambies, \"Adelaide\" and \"The Mill.\" \"A"]]]
