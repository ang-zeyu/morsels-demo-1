It only came out for a minute, but she saw it quite plainly, and  she said to herself: \"Dear me, what a curious, shiny, bright-looking  creature! If it were bigger, and if I didn't know that there have been  no fabulous monsters for quite a long time now, I should almost think it  was a dragon.\"    The thing, whatever it was, did look rather like a dragon--but then it  was too small; and it looked rather like a lizard--only then it was too  big. It was about as long as a hearthrug.    \"I wish it had not been in such a hurry to get back into the wood,\" said  Sabrinetta. \"Of course, it's quite safe for me, in my dragonproof tower;  but if it is a dragon, it's quite big enough to eat people, and today's  the first of May, and the children go out to get flowers in the wood.\"    When Sabrinetta had done the housework (she did not leave so much as a  speck of dust anywhere, even in the corneriest corner of the winding  stair) she put on her milk white, silky gown with the moon-daisies  worked on it, and went up to the top of her tower again.    Across the fields troops of children were going out to gather the may,  and the sound of their laughter and singing came up to the top of the  tower.    \"I do hope it wasn't a dragon,\" said Sabrinetta.    The children went by twos and by threes and by tens and by twenties, and  the red and blue and yellow and white of their frocks were scattered on  the green of the field.    \"It's like a green silk mantle worked with flowers,\" said the Princess,  smiling.    Then by twos and by threes, by tens and by twenties, the children  vanished into the wood, till the mantle of the field was left plain  green once more.    \"All the embroidery is unpicked,\" said the Princess, sighing.    The sun shone, and the sky was blue, and the fields were quite green,  and all the flowers were very bright indeed, because it was May Day.    Then quite suddenly a cloud passed over the sun, and the silence was  broken by shrieks from far off; and, like a many-colored torrent, all  the children burst from the wood and rushed, a red and blue and yellow  and white wave, across the field, screaming as they ran. Their voices  came up to the Princess on her tower, and she heard the words threaded  on their screams like beads on sharp needles: \"The dragon, the dragon,  the dragon! Open the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon!\"    And they swept across the field and into the gate of the town, and the  Princess heard the gate bang, and the children were out of sight--but on  the other side of the field the rose-thorns crackled and smashed in the  hedge, and something very large and glaring and horrible trampled the  ferns in the ditch for one moment before it hid itself again in the  covert of the wood.    The Princess went down and told her nurse, and the nurse at once locked  the great door of the tower and put the key in her pocket.    \"Let them take care of themselves,\" she said, when the Princess begged  to be allowed to go out and help to take care of the children. \"My  business is to take care of you, my precious, and I'm going to do it.  Old as I am, I can turn a key still.\"    So Sabrinetta went up again to the top of her tower, and cried whenever  she thought of the children and the fiery dragon. For she knew, of  course, that the gates of the town were not dragonproof, and that the  dragon could just walk in whenever he liked.    The children ran straight to the palace, where the Prince was cracking  his hunting whip down at the kennels, and told him what had happened.    \"Good sport,\" said the Prince, and he ordered out his pack of  hippopotamuses at once. It was his custom to hunt big game with  hippopotamuses, and people would not have minded that so much--but he  would swagger about in the streets of the town with his pack yelping and  gamboling at his heels, and when he did that, the green-grocer, who had  his stall in the marketplace, always regretted it; and the crockery  merchant, who spread his wares on the pavement, was ruined for life  every time the Prince chose to show off his pack.    The Prince rode out of the town with his hippopotamuses trotting and  frisking behind him, and people got inside their houses as quickly as  they could when they heard the voices of his pack and the blowing of his  horn. The pack squeezed through the town gates and off across country to  hunt the dragon. Few of you who had not seen a pack of hippopotamuses in  full cry will be able to imagine at all what the hunt was like. To begin  with, hippopotamuses do not bay like hounds: They grunt like pigs, and  their grunt is very big and fierce. Then, of course, no one expects  hippopotamuses to jump. They just crash through the hedges and lumber  through the standing corn, doing serious injury to the crops, and  annoying the farmers very much. All the hippopotamuses had collars with  their name and address on, but when the farmers called at the palace to  complain of the injury to their standing crops, the Prince always said  it served them right for leaving their crops standing about in people's  way, and he never paid anything at all.    So now, when he and his pack went out, several people in the town  whispered, \"I wish the dragon would eat him\"--which was very wrong of  them, no doubt, but then he was such a very nasty Prince.    They hunted by field, and they hunted by wold; they drew the woods  blank, and the scent didn't lie on the downs at all. The dragon was shy,  and would not show himself.    But just as the Prince was beginning to think there was no dragon at  all, but only a cock and bull, his favourite old hippopotamus gave  tongue. The Prince blew his horn and shouted: \"Tally ho! Hark forward!  Tantivy!\" and the whole pack charged downhill toward the hollow by the  wood. For there, plain to be seen, was the dragon, as big as a barge,  glowing like a furnace, and spitting fire and showing his shining teeth.    \"The hunt is up!\" cried the Prince. And indeed it was. For the  dragon--instead of behaving as a quarry should, and running away--ran  straight at the pack, and the Prince, on his elephant, had the  mortification of seeing his prize pack swallowed up one by one in the  twinkling of an eye, by the dragon they had come out to hunt. The dragon  swallowed all the hippopotamuses just as a dog swallows bits of meat. It  was a shocking sight. Of the whole of the pack that had come out  sporting so merrily to the music of the horn, now not even a  puppy-hippopotamus was left, and the dragon was looking anxiously around  to see if he had forgotten anything.    The Prince slipped off his elephant on the other side and ran into the  thickest part of the wood. He hoped the dragon could not break through  the bushes there, since they were very strong and close. He went  crawling on hands and knees in a most un-Prince-like way, and at last,  finding a hollow tree, he crept into it. The wood was very still--no  crashing of branches and no smell of burning came to alarm the Prince.  He drained the silver hunting bottle slung from his shoulder, and  stretched his legs in the hollow tree. He never shed a single tear for  his poor tame hippopotamuses who had eaten from his hand and followed  him faithfully in all the pleasures of the chase for so many years. For  he was a false Prince, with a skin like leather and hair like hearth  brushes and a heart like a stone. He never shed a tear, but he just went  to sleep.    When he awoke it was dark. He crept out of the tree and rubbed his eyes.  The wood was black about him, but there was a red glow in a dell close  by. It was a fire of sticks, and beside it sat a ragged youth with long,  yellow hair; all around lay sleeping forms which breathed heavily.    \"Who are you?\" said the Prince.    \"I'm Elfin, the pig keeper,\" said the ragged youth. \"And who are you?\"    \"I'm Tiresome, the Prince,\" said the other.    \"And what are you doing out of your palace at this time of night?\" asked  the pig keeper, severely.    \"I've been hunting,\" said the Prince.    The pig keeper laughed. \"Oh, it was you I saw, then? A good hunt, wasn't  it? My pigs and I were looking on.\"    All the sleeping forms grunted and snored, and the Prince saw that they  were pigs: He knew it by their manners.    \"If you had known as much as I do,\" Elfin went on, \"you might have saved  your pack.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Tiresome.    \"Why, the dragon,\" said Elfin. \"You went out at the wrong time of day.  The dragon should be hunted at night.\"    \"No, thank you,\" said the Prince, with a shudder. \"A daylight hunt is  quite good enough for me, you silly pig keeper.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Elfin, \"do as you like about it--the dragon will come  and hunt you tomorrow, as likely as not. I don't care if he does, you  silly Prince.\"    \"You're very rude,\" said Tiresome.    \"Oh, no, only truthful,\" said Elfin.    \"Well, tell me the truth, then. What is it that, if I had known as much  as you do about, I shouldn't have lost my hippopotamuses?\"    \"You don't speak very good English,\" said Elfin. \"But come, what will  you give me if I tell you?\"    \"If you tell me what?\" said the tiresome Prince.    \"What you want to know.\"    \"I don't want to know anything,\" said Prince Tiresome.    \"Then you're more of a silly even than I thought,\" said Elfin. \"Don't  you want to know how to settle the dragon before he settles you?\"    \"It might be as well,\" the Prince admitted.    \"Well, I haven't much patience at any time,\" said Elfin, \"and now I can  assure you that there's very little left. What will you give me if I  tell you?\"    \"Half my kingdom,\" said the Prince, \"and my cousin's hand in marriage.\"    \"Done,\" said the pig keeper. \"Here goes! The dragon grows small at  night! He sleeps under the root of this tree. I use him to light my fire  with.\"    And, sure enough, there under the tree was the dragon on a nest of  scorched moss, and he was about"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#19)"],[1,"dish, but  really important question. The Alligator may use his tail as a club, the  Horse, his tail as a fly-flapper, the Porcupine his tail as a spiked  war-club, the 'Possum his as a hooked hanger, the Fox his as a muffler,  the Fish his as a paddle; but the Gray Squirrel's tail is a parachute, a  landeasy. I have seen a Gray Squirrel fall fifty feet to the ground, but  his tail was in good condition; he spread it to the utmost and it landed  him safely right side up.    I remember also a story of a Squirrel that lost his tail by an accident.  It didn't seem to matter much for a while. The stump healed up, and the  Squirrel was pert as ever; but one day he missed his hold in jumping,  and fell to the ground. Ordinarily, that would have been a small matter;  but without his tail he was jarred so severely that a dog, who saw him  fall, ran up and killed him before he could recover and climb a tree.      TALE 67    Why a Dog Wags His Tail    There is an old story that the Dog said to the Cat: \"Cat, you are a  fool; you growl when you are pleased and wag your tail when you are  angry.\" Which happens to be true; and makes us ask: Why does a Dog wag  his tail to mean friendship?    The fact is, it is part of a wig-wag code, which is doubly interesting  now that all our boys are learning wig-wagging with a white flag. We  think that our army people invented this method; but Woodcraft men know  better.    First, notice that any Dog that has any white on his body has at least a  little white on the end of his tail. This is well known; and the reason  is that the wild ancestor had a white brush on the end of his tail; a  white flag, indeed; and this was the flag of his signal code.    Suppose, then, that a wild Dog, prowling through the woods, sights some  other animal. Instantly he crouches; for it is good woodcraft to avoid  being seen and then watch from your hiding-place. As the stranger comes  near, the crouching Dog sees that it is one of his own kind, and that it  is needless to hide any longer; indeed, that it is impossible to remain  hidden. So the moment the stranger stops and looks at the crouching Dog,  the latter stands straight up on all fours, raises his tail up high, and  wags the white tip from side to side in the sign which means, \"Let's be  friends.\"    Every Dog knows the sign, every Dog in every town does it yet; every boy  has seen it a thousand times. We flatter ourselves that we invented the  wig-wag code with our little white flag. Maybe so; but the Dog had it  long before we did.      TALE 68    Why the Dog Turns Around Three Times Before Lying Down    Yes, they all do it; the big St. Bernard, the foolish littlest lap Dog,  the ragged street Dog; give them bare boards, or a silken cushion, or  snow, three turns around and down they go.    Why? Not so hard to answer as some simple questions. Long, long ago, the  wild great-great-grandfather of the Dog--a yellow creature with black  hair sprinkled on his back, sharp ears, light spots over his eyes, and a  white tail-tip--used to live in the woods, or on the prairies. He did  not have a home to which he might return every time he wanted to rest  or sleep; so he camped wherever he found himself, on the plains, in a  thicket, or even in some hole in a rock; and he carried his bedclothes  on his back. But he always found it worth while to add a little comfort  by smoothing the grass, the leaves, the twigs, or the pebbles before  lying down; and the simplest way to do this was by curling up, and  turning round three times, with the body brushing the high grass or  pebbles into a comfortable shape for a bed.    Yes, and they all do it to-day just the same, big and little, which is  only one of the many proofs that they are descended from the same  wild-wood great-grandfather, and still remember his habits.      TALE 69    The Deathcup of Diablo    [Illustration: The Deathcup Toadstool]    The world went very well in those bright days of the long ago, when the  wedding of El Sol and Maka Ina set all living things rejoicing. Green  youth and sparkling happiness were everywhere. Only one there  was--Diablo--who found in it poor comfort. He had no pleasure in the  growing grass. The buttercups annoyed him with the gayness of their  gold. It was at this time he chewed their stalks, so that many ever  since have been flattened and mangled. And the cherry with its fragrant  bloom he breathed on with his poison breath, so its limbs were burnt and  blackened into horrid canker bumps. And poisonous froth he blew on the  sprouting rose leaves, so they blackened and withered away. The jewel  weed, friend of the humming birds, he trampled down, but it rose so many  times and so bravely, that he left the yellow dodder like an herb-worm,  or a root-born leech to suck its blood all summer long, and break it  down. Then to trail over the trunks of trees and suck their life, he  left the demon vine, the Poison Ivy with its touch of burning fire. He  put the Snapping Turtle in the beautiful lakes to destroy its harmless  creatures and the Yellow-eyed Whizz he sent, and the Witherbloom with  its breath of flame.    And last he made the Deathcup Toadstool, and sowed it in the woods.    He saw the Squirrels eating and storing up the sweet red russula. He saw  it furnish food to mice and deer, so he fashioned the Deathcup Amanita  to be like it; and scattered it wherever good mushrooms grew, a trap for  the unwary.    Tall and shapely is the Deathcup; beautiful to look upon and smelling  like a mushroom. But beware of it, a very little is enough, a morsel of  the cup; the next night or maybe a day later the poison pangs set in.  Too late perhaps for medicine to help, and Amanita, the Deathcup, the  child of Diablo, has claimed another victim.    How shall we know the deadly Amanita among its kindly cousins, the good  mushrooms? Wise men say by these:--The poison cup from which its  springs; the white kid collar on its neck; the white or yellow gills;  and the white spores that fall from its gills if the cup, without the  stem, be laid gills down on a black paper for an hour.    By these things we may know the wan Demon of the woods, but the wisest  Guides say to their tribe:--\"Because death lurks in that shapely  mushroom, though there are a hundred good for food, they are much alike,  and safety bids you shun them; let them all alone.\"    So Diablo went on his way rejoicing because he had spoiled so much good  food for good folk.    This, the danger of the Deathcup, is the Seventh Secret of the Woods.    [Illustration: The Poison Ivy]      TALE 70    Poison Ivy or the Three-Fingered Demon of the Woods    You have been hearing about good fairies and good old Mother Carey and  Medicine in the Sky. Now I am going to warn you against the  three-fingered Demon, the wicked snakevine that basks on stone walls and  climbs up the tree trunk, and does more harm than all the other plants,  vines, trees, and bushes put together; for it is not like the Deathcup,  easy to see and easy to let alone.    This is the Poison Ivy. Does it not look poisonous as it crawls  snake-like up some trunk, sending suckers out into the tree to suck the  sap; and oozing all over its limbs with poison in tiny wicked little  drops? Sometimes it does not climb but crawls on the ground, but by this  ye may always know it: It has only three fingers on its hand; that is,  only three leaflets on each stalk.    The one thing that looks like it, is the Boston Ivy, but that does not  grow in the woods, and the Poison Ivy leaf always has the little bump  and bite out on the side of the leaf as you see in the drawing.    It is known and feared for its power to sting and blister the skin when  it is handled or even touched. The sting begins with an unpleasant  itching which gets worse, especially if rubbed, until it blisters and  breaks open with sores which are very hard to heal.    The cause of the sting is a blistering oil, which is found in tiny drops  on all parts of the leaf and branches; it is a fixed oil; that is, it  will not dry up, and as long as it is on the skin, it keeps on burning  and blistering, worse and worse.      THE CURE    And this is the cure for the sting of the Demon Vine:--    Anything that will dissolve and remove oil without injuring the skin:--    Hot water, as hot as you can stand it, is good; a little salt in it  helps.    Hot soapy water is good.    Hot water with washing soda is good.    A wash of alcohol is good.    But best of all is a wash of strong alcohol in which is a little sugar  of lead as an antiseptic.           *       *       *       *       *    The Guide should remember that three persons out of five are immune from  Poison Ivy, while a few are so sensitive that they are poisoned by flies  carrying it to them on their feet. It can be easily cured if treated at  once; if neglected it often becomes very bad and may need the help of a  doctor.    This is the Eighth Secret of the Woods.      TALE 71    The Medicine in the Sky    This is one of the greatest and best secrets of Woodcraft--The Medicine  in the Sky.    Let me tell you a story about it. There was once an Indian who left his  own people, to live with the white man, in the East. But the Great  Spirit was displeased, for he did not mean the Indian to live in houses  or cities. After a year, the red man came back very thin and sick,  coughing nearly all night, instead of sleeping. He believed himself  dying.    The wise old Medicine Man of his tribe said, \"You need the Medicine of  the Sky.\" He took it and got quite well and strong.    Another Indian, who had gone to visit with a distant tribe of red men,  came back with some sickness on his skin that made it very sore. It was  far worse than Poison Ivy, for it began to eat into his flesh. The  Medicine Man said, \"Sky Medicine will cure you.\" And it did.    One day a white man, a trader, came with chest protectors to sell to the  Indians. He was sure they"]]]
