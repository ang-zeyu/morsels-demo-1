Hence the deal was closed and the deed was given    And the Lord went back to his home in heaven.    And the devil then said, \"I have all that is needed    To make a good hell,\" and hence he succeeded.      He began to put thorns in all of the trees,    And mixed up the sand with millions of fleas;    And scattered tarantulas along all the roads;    Put thorns on the cactus and horns on the toads.    He lengthened the horns of the Texas steers,    And put an addition on the rabbit's ears;    He put a little devil in the broncho steed,    And poisoned the feet of the centipede.      The rattlesnake bites you, the scorpion stings,    The mosquito delights you with buzzing wings;    The sand-burrs prevail and so do the ants,    And those who sit down need half-soles on their pants.    The devil then said that throughout the land    He'd managed to keep up the devil's own brand,    And all would be mavericks unless they bore    The marks of scratches and bites and thorns by the score.      The heat in the summer is a hundred and ten,    Too hot for the devil and too hot for men.    The wild boar roams through the black chaparral,--    It's a hell of a place he has for a hell.    The red pepper grows on the banks of the brook;    The Mexicans use it in all that they cook.    Just dine with a Greaser and then you will shout,    \"I've hell on the inside as well as the out!\"          BY MARKENTURA'S FLOWERY MARGE        By Markentura's flowery marge the Red Chief's wigwam stood,    Before the white man's rifle rang, loud echoing through the wood;    The tommy-hawk and scalping knife together lay at rest,    And peace was in the forest shade and in the red man's breast.        Oh, the Spotted Fawn, oh, the Spotted Fawn,      The life and light of the forest shade,--      The Red Chief's child is gone!      By Markentura's flowery marge the Spotted Fawn had birth    And grew as fair an Indian maid as ever graced the earth.    She was the Red Chief's only child and sought by many a brave,    But to the gallant young White Cloud her plighted troth she gave.      By Markentura's flowery marge the bridal song arose,    Nor dreamed they in that festive night of near approaching woes;    But through the forest stealthily the white man came in wrath.    And fiery darts before them spread, and death was in their path.      By Markentura's flowery marge next morn no strife was seen,    But a wail went up, for the young Fawn's blood and White Cloud's dyed        the green.    A burial in their own rude way the Indians gave them there,    And a low sweet requiem the brook sang and the air.        Oh, the Spotted Fawn, oh, the Spotted Fawn,      The life and light of the forest shade,--      The Red Chief's child is gone!          THE STATE OF ARKANSAW        My name is Stamford Barnes, I come from Nobleville town;    I've traveled this wide world over, I've traveled this wide world round.    I've met with ups and downs in life but better days I've saw,    But I've never knew what misery were till I came to Arkansaw.      I landed in St. Louis with ten dollars and no more;    I read the daily papers till both my eyes were sore;    I read them evening papers until at last I saw    Ten thousand men were wanted in the state of Arkansaw.      I wiped my eyes with great surprise when I read this grateful news,    And straightway off I started to see the agent, Billy Hughes.    He says, \"Pay me five dollars and a ticket to you I'll draw,    It'll land you safe upon the railroad in the State of Arkansaw.\"      I started off one morning a quarter after five;    I started from St. Louis, half dead and half alive;    I bought me a quart of whiskey my misery to thaw,    I got as drunk as a biled owl when I left for old Arkansaw.      I landed in Ft. Smith one sultry Sunday afternoon,    It was in the month of May, the early month of June,    Up stepped a walking skeleton with a long and lantern jaw,    Invited me to his hotel, \"The best in Arkansaw.\"      I followed my conductor into his dwelling place;    Poverty were depictured in his melancholy face.    His bread it was corn dodger, his beef I could not chaw;    This was the kind of hash they fed me in the State of Arkansaw.      I started off next morning to catch the morning train,    He says to me, \"You'd better work, for I have some land to drain.    I'll pay you fifty cents a day, your board, washing, and all,--    You'll find yourself a different man when you leave old Arkansaw.\"      I worked six weeks for the son of a gun, Jesse Herring was his name,    He was six foot seven in his stocking feet and taller than any crane;    His hair hung down in strings over his long and lantern jaw,--    He was a photograph of all the gents who lived in Arkansaw.      He fed me on corn dodgers as hard as any rock,    Until my teeth began to loosen and my knees began to knock;    I got so thin on sassafras tea I could hide behind a straw,    And indeed I was a different man when I left old Arkansaw.      Farewell to swamp angels, cane brakes, and chills;    Farewell to sage and sassafras and corn dodger pills.    If ever I see this land again, I'll give to you my paw;    It will be through a telescope from here to Arkansaw.          THE TEXAS COWBOY        Oh, I am a Texas cowboy,    Far away from home,    If ever I get back to Texas    I never more will roam.      Montana is too cold for me    And the winters are too long;    Before the round-ups do begin    Our money is all gone.      Take this old hen-skin bedding,    Too thin to keep me warm,--    I nearly freeze to death, my boys.    Whenever there's a storm.      And take this old \"tarpoleon,\"    Too thin to shield my frame,--    I got it down in Nebraska    A-dealin' a Monte game.      Now to win these fancy leggins    I'll have enough to do;    They cost me twenty dollars    The day that they were new.      I have an outfit on the Mussel Shell,    But that I'll never see,    Unless I get sent to represent    The Circle or D.T.      I've worked down in Nebraska    Where the grass grows ten feet high,    And the cattle are such rustlers    That they seldom ever die;      I've worked up in the sand hills    And down upon the Platte,    Where the cowboys are good fellows    And the cattle always fat;      I've traveled lots of country,--    Nebraska's hills of sand,    Down through the Indian Nation,    And up the Rio Grande;--      But the Bad Lands of Montana    Are the worst I ever seen,    The cowboys are all tenderfeet    And the dogies are too lean.      If you want to see some bad lands,    Go over on the Dry;    You will bog down in the coulees    Where the mountains reach the sky.      A tenderfoot to lead you    Who never knows the way,    You are playing in the best of luck    If you eat more than once a day.      Your grub is bread and bacon    And coffee black as ink;    The water is so full of alkali    It is hardly fit to drink.      They will wake you in the morning    Before the break of day,    And send you on a circle    A hundred miles away.      All along the Yellowstone    'Tis cold the year around;    You will surely get consumption    By sleeping on the ground.      Work in Montana    Is six months in the year;    When all your bills are settled    There is nothing left for beer.      Work down in Texas    Is all the year around;    You will never get consumption    By sleeping on the ground.      Come all you Texas cowboys    And warning take from me,    And do not go to Montana    To spend your money free.      But stay at home in Texas    Where work lasts the year around,    And you will never catch consumption    By sleeping on the ground.          THE DREARY, DREARY LIFE        A cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,    Some say it's free from care;    Rounding up the cattle from morning till night    In the middle of the prairie so bare.        Half-past four, the noisy cook will roar,     \"Whoop-a-whoop-a-hey!\"      Slowly you will rise with sleepy-feeling eyes,      The sweet, dreamy night passed away.      The greener lad he thinks it's play,    He'll soon peter out on a cold rainy day,    With his big bell spurs and his Spanish hoss,    He'll swear to you he was once a boss.      The cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,    He's driven through the heat and cold;    While the rich man's a-sleeping on his velvet couch,    Dreaming of his silver and gold.      Spring-time sets in, double trouble will begin,    The weather is so fierce and cold;    Clothes are wet and frozen to our necks,    The cattle we can scarcely hold.      The cowboy's life is a dreary one,    He works all day to the setting of the sun;    And then his day's work is not done,    For there's his night herd to go on.      The wolves and owls with their terrifying howls    Will disturb us in our midnight dream,    As we lie on our slickers on a cold, rainy night    Way over on the Pecos stream.      You are speaking of your farms, you are speaking of your charms,    You are speaking of your silver and gold;    But a cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,    He's driven through the heat and cold.      Some folks say that we are free from care,    Free from all other harm;    But we round up the cattle from morning till night    Way over on the prairie so dry.      I used to run about, now I stay at home,    Take care of my wife and child;    Nevermore to roam, always stay at home,    Take care of my wife and child.        Half-past four the noisy cook will roar,     \"Hurrah, boys! she's breaking day!\"      Slowly we will rise and wipe our sleepy eyes,      The sweet, dreamy night passed away.        The Dreary, Dreary Life (Mus. Not.)        A cow-boy's life is a drear-y, drear-y life, Some    REFRAIN.--Half-past four the ... noi-sy cook will roar,      say it's free from care; Rounding up the    \"Whoop-a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#19)"],[1,"afterwards completed: the length of this is  a voyage of four days, and in breadth it was so dug that two triremes  could go side by side driven by oars; and the water is brought into  it from the Nile. The channel is conducted a little above the city of  Bubastis by Patumos the Arabian city, and runs into the Erythraian Sea:  and it is dug first along those parts of the plain of Egypt which lie  towards Arabia, just above which run the mountains which extend  opposite Memphis, where are the stone-quarries,--along the base of these  mountains the channel is conducted from West to East for a great way;  and after that it is directed towards a break in the hills and tends  from these mountains towards the noon-day and the South Wind to the  Arabian gulf. Now in the place where the journey is least and shortest  from the Northern to the Southern Sea (which is also called Erythraian),  that is from Mount Casion, which is the boundary between Egypt and  Syria, the distance is exactly a thousand furlongs to the Arabian gulf;  but the channel is much longer, since it is more winding; and in the  reign of Necos there perished while digging it twelve myriads of the  Egyptians. Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging, because the  utterance of an Oracle impeded him, which was to the effect that he was  working for the Barbarian: and the Egyptians call all men Barbarians who  do not agree with them in speech. Thus having ceased from the work of  the channel, Necos betook himself to raging wars, and triremes were  built by him, some for the Northern Sea and others in the Arabian gulf  for the Erythraian Sea; and of these the sheds are still to be seen.  These ships he used when he needed them; and also on land Necos engaged  battle at Magdolos with the Syrians, and conquered them; and after this  he took Cadytis, which is a great city of Syria: and the dress which he  wore when he made these conquests he dedicated to Apollo, sending it to  Branchidai of the Milesians. After this, having reigned in all sixteen  years, he brought his life to an end, and handed on the kingdom to  Psammis his son.    While this Psammis was king of Egypt, there came to him men sent by the  Eleians, who boasted that they ordered the contest at Olympia in the  most just and honourable manner possible and thought that not even the  Egyptians, the wisest of men, could find out anything besides, to be  added to their rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that  for which they had come, then this king called together those of the  Egyptians who were reputed the wisest, and when the Egyptians had come  together they heard the Eleians tell of all that which it was their part  to do in regard to the contest; and when they had related everything,  they said that they had come to learn in addition anything which the  Egyptians might be able to find out besides, which was juster than this.  They then having consulted together asked the Eleians whether their own  citizens took part in the contest; and they said that it was permitted  to any one who desired it, to take part in the contest: upon which the  Egyptians said that in so ordering the games they had wholly missed the  mark of justice; for it could not be but that they would take part with  the man of their own State, if he was contending, and so act unfairly  to the stranger: but if they really desired, as they said, to order  the games justly, and if this was the cause for which they had come to  Egypt, they advised them to order the contest so as to be for strangers  alone to contend in, and that no Eleian should be permitted to contend.  Such was the suggestion made by the Egyptians to the Eleians.    When Psammis had been king of Egypt for only six years and had made an  expedition to Ethiopia and immediately afterwards had ended his life,  Apries the son of Psammis received the kingdom in succession. This man  came to be the most prosperous of all the kings up to that time except  only his forefather Psammetichos; and he reigned five-and-twenty years,  during which he led an army against Sidon and fought a sea-fight with  the king of Tyre. Since however it was fated that evil should come upon  him it came by occasion of a matter which I shall relate at greater  length in the Libyan history, and at present but shortly. Apries having  sent a great expedition against the Kyrenians, met with correspondingly  great disaster; and the Egyptians considering him to blame for this  revolted from him, supposing that Apries had with forethought sent them  out to evident calamity, in order (as they said) that there might be a  slaughter of them, and he might the more securely rule over the other  Egyptians. Being indignant at this, both these men who had returned  from the expedition and also the friends of those who had perished made  revolt openly. Hearing this Apries sent to them Amasis, to cause them  to cease by persuasion; and when he had come and was seeking to restrain  the Egyptians, as he was speaking and telling them not to do so, one of  the Egyptians stood up behind him and put a helmet upon his head, saying  as he did so that he put it on to crown him king. And to him this  that was done was in some degree not unwelcome, as he proved by his  behaviour; for as soon as the revolted Egyptians had set him up as king,  he prepared to march against Apries: and Apries hearing this sent to  Amasis one of the Egyptians who were about his own person, a man of  reputation, whose name was Patarbemis, enjoining him to bring Amasis  alive into his presence. When this Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis,  the latter, who happened to be sitting on horseback, lifted up his leg  and behaved in an unseemly manner, bidding him take that back to Apries.  Nevertheless, they say, Patarbemis made demand of him that he should  go to the king, seeing that the king had sent to summon him; and he  answered him that he had for some time past been preparing to do so, and  that Apries would have no occasion to find fault with him, for he  would both come himself and bring others with him. Then Patarbemis both  perceiving his intention from that which he said, and also seeing his  preparations, departed in haste, desiring to make known as quickly as  possible to the king the things which were being done: and when he came  back to Apries not bringing Amasis, the king paying no regard to that  which he said, but being moved by violent anger, ordered his ears and  his nose to be cut off. And the rest of the Egyptians who still remained  on his side, when they saw the man of most repute among them thus  suffering shameful outrage, waited no longer but joined the others in  revolt, and delivered themselves over to Amasis. Then Apries having  heard this also, armed his foreign mercenaries and marched against the  Egyptians: now he had about him Carian and Ionian mercenaries to the  number of thirty thousand; and his royal palace was in the city of Sais,  of great size and worthy to be seen. So Apries and his army were going  against the Egyptians, and Amasis and those with him were going against  the mercenaries; and both sides came to the city of Momemphis and were  about to make trial of one another in fight.    Now of the Egyptians there are seven classes, and of these one class is  called that of the priests, and another that of the warriors, while  the others are the cowherds, swineherds, shopkeepers, interpreters, and  boatmen. This is the number of the classes of the Egyptians, and their  names are given them from the occupations which they follow. Of them the  warriors are called Calasirians and Hermotybians, and they are of the  following districts,--for all Egypt is divided into districts. The  districts of the Hermotybians are those of Busiris, Sais, Chemmis,  Papremis, the island called Prosopitis, and the half of Natho,--of  these districts are the Hermotybians, who reached when most numerous the  number of sixteen myriads. Of these not one has been learnt anything of  handicraft, but they are given up to war entirely. Again the districts  of the Calasirians are those of Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis,  Mendes, Sebennytos, Athribis, Pharbaithos, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anytis,  Myecphoris,--this last is on an island opposite to the city of Bubastis.  These are the districts of the Calasirians; and they reached, when most  numerous, to the number of five-and-twenty myriads of men; nor is it  lawful for these, any more than for the others, to practise any craft;  but they practise that which has to do with war only, handing down the  tradition from father to son. Now whether the Hellenes have learnt this  also from the Egyptians, I am not able to say for certain, since I  see that the Thracians also and Scythians and Persians and Lydians and  almost all the Barbarians esteem those of their citizens who learn the  arts, and the descendants of them, as less honourable than the rest;  while those who have got free from all practice of manual arts are  accounted noble, and especially those who are devoted to war: however  that may be, the Hellenes have all learnt this, and especially the  Lacedemonians; but the Corinthians least of all cast slight upon those  who practise handicraft.    The following privilege was specially granted to this class and to none  others of the Egyptians except the priests, that is to say, each man had  twelve yokes of land specially granted to him free from imposts: now  the yoke of land measures a hundred Egyptian cubits every way, and the  Egyptian cubit is, as it happens, equal to that of Samos. This, I  say, was a special privilege granted to all, and they also had certain  advantages in turn and not the same men twice; that is to say, a  thousand of the Calasirians and a thousand of the Hermotybians acted  as body-guard to the king during each year; and these had besides their  yokes of land an allowance given them for each day of five pounds weight  of bread to each"]]]
