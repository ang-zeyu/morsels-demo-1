Johann Sebastian's indifference to criticism is partially explained by  the fact that he was in correspondence with the Consistory at Mulhausen,  and also with the Duke Wilhelm Ernest, of Saxe-Weimar. Both Mulhausen  and Weimar wanted his services. Under such conditions men have ever been  known to invite a rupture--let us hope that Johann Sebastian Bach was  not quite so human.           *       *       *       *       *    Michelangelo never married, but Bach held the average good by marrying  twice.    He was the father of just twenty children. His first wife was a woman  with well-defined musical tastes, as was meet in one with such an  illustrious musical pedigree. It wasn't fashion then to educate women,  and one biographer expresses a doubt as to whether Bach's first wife was  able to read and write. To read and write are rather cheap  accomplishments, though. Last year I met several excellent specimens of  manhood in the Tennessee Mountains who could do neither, yet these men  had a goodly hold on the eternal verities.    We know that Bach's wife had a thorough sympathy with his work, and that  he used to sing or play his compositions to her, and when the children  got big enough, they tried the new-made hymn tunes, too. These children  sang before they could talk plain, and the result was that the two elder  sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Phillip Emmanuel, became musicians of  marked ability. Half a dozen other sons became musicians also, but the  two named above made some valuable additions to the music fund of the  world. Haydn has paid personal tribute to Emmanuel Bach, acknowledging  his obligation, and expressing to him the belief that he was a greater  man than his father.    The nine years Bach spent at Weimar, under the patronage of the Duke  Wilhelm Ernest, were years rich in results. His office was that of  Concert Master, and Leader of the Choir at Ducal Chapel. The duties not  being very exacting, he had plenty of time to foster his bent. Freed  from all apprehension along the line of the bread-and-butter question he  devoted himself untiringly to his work. It was here he developed that  style of fingering that was to be followed by the players on the  harpsichord, and which further serves as the basis for our present  manner of piano-playing. Bach was the first man to make use of the thumb  in organ-playing, and I believe it was James Huneker who once said that  \"Bach discovered the human hand.\"    Bach made a complete study of the mechanism of the organ, invented  various arrangements for the better use of the pedals, and gave his  ideas without stint to the makers, who, it seems, were glad to profit by  them. Even then Weimar was a place of pilgrimage, although Goethe had  not yet come to illumine it with his presence. But the traditions of  Weimar have been musical and artistic for four hundred years, and this  had its weight with Goethe when he decided to make it his home.    In Bach's day, pilgrims from afar used to come to attend the musical  festivals given by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar; and these pilgrims would go  home and spread the name of Johann Sebastian Bach. Many invitations used  to come for him to go and play at the installation of a new organ, or to  superintend the construction of an organ, or to lead a chorus. Gradually  his fame grew, and although he might have lived his life and ended his  days there in the rural and peaceful quiet of Weimar, yet he harkened to  the voice and arose and went forth with his family into a place that  afforded a wider scope for his powers.    As Kapellmeister to the Court at Kothen he had the direction of a large  orchestra, and it seems also supervised a school of music.    When the Court moved about from place to place it was the custom to take  the orchestra, too, in order to reveal to the natives along the way what  good music really was. This was all quite on the order of the Duke of  Mantua, who used to travel with a retinue of two hundred servants and  attendants.    On one such occasion the Kothen Court went to Carlsbad. The visit  extended itself to six months, when Bach became impatient to return to  his family, and was allowed to go in advance of the rest of the company.  On reaching home he found his wife had died and been buried several  weeks before.    It was a severe shock to the poor man, but fortunately there was more  philosophy to his nature than romance, which is a marked trait in the  German character. All this is plainly evidenced by the fact that in many  German churches when a good wife dies, the pastor, at the funeral, as  the best friend of the stricken husband, casts his eyes over the  congregation for a suitable successor to the deceased. And very often  the funeral baked meats do coldly furnish forth the marriage feast. Man  is made to mourn, but most widowers say but a year.    The prompt second marriage of Bach was certainly a compliment to the  memory of his first wife, who was a most amiable helpmeet and friend. No  soft sentiment disturbed the deep immersement of this man in his work.  He was as businesslike a man as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who arranged his  second marriage by correspondence, and then drove over in a buggy one  afternoon to bring home the promised bride, making notes by the way on  the Over-Soul and man's place in the Universal Cosmos.    Events proved the wisdom of Johann Sebastian Bach's choice. His first  wife filled his heart, but this one was not only to do as much, but  often to guide his hand and brain. He was thirty-eight with a brood of  nine. Anna Magdalena was twenty-three, strong, fancy-free, and by a  dozen, lacking one, was to increase the limit.    As the years went by, Bach occasionally would arise in public places,  and with uncovered head thank God for the blessings He had bestowed upon  him, especially in sending him such a wife.    Anna Magdalena Wulken was a singer of merit, a player on the harp, and a  person of education. She certainly had no seraglio notions of wanting to  be petted and pampered and taken care of, or she would not have assumed  the office of stepmother to that big family and married a poor man. Bach  never had time to make money. Very soon after their marriage Bach began  to dictate music to his wife. A great many pieces can be seen in Leipzig  and Berlin copied out in her fine, painstaking hand, with an occasional  interlining by the Master. Other pieces written by him are amended by  her, showing plainly that they worked together.    As proof that this was no honeymoon whim, the collaboration continued  for over a score of years, in spite of increasing domestic  responsibilities.    From Kothen, Bach was called to Leipzig and elected by the municipal  authorities the Musical Director and Cantor of the Thomas School. For  twenty-seven years he labored here, doing the work he liked best, and  doing it in his own way. He escaped the pitfalls of petty jealousies,  into which most men of artistic natures fall, by rising above them all.  He accepted no insults; he had no grievances against either man or fate;  earnest, religious, simple--he filled the days with useful effort.    He was so well poised that when summoned by Frederick the Great to come  and play before him, he took a year to finish certain work he had on  hand before he went. Then he would have forgotten the engagement, had  not his son, who was Chamber Musician to the King, insisted that he  come. In the presence of Frederick it was the King who was abashed, not  he. He knew his kinship to Divinity so well that he did not even think  to assert it. And surely he was one fit to stand in the presence of  kings. For number, variety and excellence, only two men can be named as  his competitors: these are Mozart and Handel. But in point of  performance, simplicity and sterling manhood, Bach stands alone.          [Illustration: FELIX MENDELSSOHN]    FELIX MENDELSSOHN           The correspondence of Goethe and Zelter displeases me. I always       feel out of sorts when I have been reading it. Do you know that I       am making great strides in water-colors? Schirmer comes to me every       Saturday at eleven, and paints for two hours at a landscape, which       he is going to make me a present of, because the subject occurred       to him whilst I was playing the little \"Rivulet\" (which you know).       It represents a fellow who saunters out of a dark forest into a       sunny little nook; trees all about, with stems thick and thin; one       has fallen across the rivulet; the ground is carpeted with soft,       deep moss, full of ferns; there are stones garlanded with       blackberry-bushes; it is fine warm weather; the whole will be       charming.         --_Mendelssohn to Devrient_      FELIX MENDELSSOHN    Thirty-eight years is not a long life, but still it is long enough to do  great things. Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was born in the year Eighteen  Hundred Nine, at Hamburg, and died at Leipzig in the year Eighteen  Hundred Forty-seven. His career was a triumphal march. The road to  success with him was no zigzag journey--from the first he went straight  to the front. Whether as a baby he crowed in key, and cried to a  one-two-three melody, as his old nurse used to aver, is a little  doubtful, possibly. But all agree that he was the most precocious  musical genius that ever lived, excepting Mozart; and Goethe, who knew  them both, declared that Mendelssohn's music bore the same relationship  to Mozart's as the talk of a grown-up cultured person to the prattle of  a child.    But then Goethe was not a musician, and sixty years had passed from the  time Goethe saw Mozart before he met Mendelssohn. Goethe loved the  brown-curled Jewish boy at sight; and whether on meeting Mozart he ever  recovered from the taint of prejudice that most people feel when a  prodigy is introduced, is a question.    But who can wonder that the old "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#19)"],[1,"1595), who also came from Lincoln to Winchester,  only held the see for ten weeks.    #William Day# (1595-1596), brother-in-law of the preceding, was provost  of Eton for no less than thirty-four years, but he died eight months  after his elevation to Winchester.    #Thomas Bilson# (1597-1616), though called by Anthony a Wood \"as  reverend and learned a prelate as England ever afforded,\" and the author  of several theological works, has left little behind him at Winchester.    #James Montagu# (1616-1618) may also be briefly dismissed. Bilson's \"On  the Perpetual Government of Christ's Church\" and Montagu's Latin  translation of the writings of James I. can hardly be said to have made  them famous. Montagu's tomb is in Bath Abbey.    #Lancelot Andrewes# (1619-1626) is the most celebrated of the  post-Reformation bishops who have held the see. He was made Bishop of  Chichester in 1605, Bishop of Ely in 1609, and moved to Winchester nine  years later. As a pious and austere man, a powerful preacher (an \"angel  in the pulpit,\" he was called), a scholar versed in patristic  literature, and a polemical writer, he is well known. Milton's elegy  suffices to prove the great respect and admiration which he inspired in  his contemporaries, and he held a considerable influence over James I.;  but his \"Manual of Devotion\" is the only volume of all his writings that  can fairly be said to have become a classic in any sense of the word.  Andrewes died at Winchester House, Southwark, on September 11, 1626; and  his tomb is at S. Saviour's, Southwark, in the Lady Chapel, whither it  was moved on the destruction of the chapel to the east of the building,  where it was originally placed.    #Richard Neile# (1627-1631), son of a tallow-chandler, though of good  descent, became Bishop of Rochester 1608, Lichfield and Coventry 1610,  Durham 1617, Winchester 1627, and Archbishop of York 1631. He was  censured by the House of Commons, together with Archbishop Laud, as  \"inclined to Arminianism and favouring Popish doctrines and ceremonies.\"    #Walter Curle# (1632-1650), who came next, was deprived of his see  during the Civil War. Like Neile, he was a follower of Laud. He is best  remembered in the Winchester of to-day for his cutting of the passage  known as the \"slype.\"    #Brian Duppa# (1660-1662), chaplain to Charles I. and tutor to his sons,  was appointed to Chichester in 1638, having previously been dean at  Oxford. In 1641 he was translated to Salisbury, but during the  Commonwealth he retired to Richmond, where he lived in solitude until  the Restoration, when he obtained the see of Winchester. An allusion to  him during his first year here may be found in Pepys, who, in his diary  for October 4, 1660, says: \"I and Lieut. Lambert to Westminster, where  we saw Dr Frewen translated to the Archbishoprick of York. Here I saw  the Bishops of Winchester, Bangor, Rochester, Bath and Wells, and  Salisbury, all in their habits, in King Henry VII.'s chapel. But, Lord!  at their going out how people did most of them look upon them as strange  creatures, and few with any kind of love or respect.\" Duppa was,  however, we are informed, \"a man of such exemplary piety, lively  conversation, and excess of good nature, that when Charles I. was in  prison at Carisbrooke Castle he thought himself happy in the company of  so good a man.\" He died in 1662 at Richmond (where an almshouse, founded  by him, bears over its gate the inscription: _I will pay my vow which I  made to God in my trouble_) and was buried at Westminster Abbey in Abbot  Islip's chapel, where a tablet records his adherence to his two kings.    #George Morley# (1662-1684), a constant supporter of Charles I., was  much favoured by him until his death on the scaffold. From this point he  lived in exile until the Restoration, when he was created Bishop of  Worcester in 1660, and was chosen to be one of the revisers of the  liturgy. In 1662 he succeeded Duppa at Winchester. He restored Farnham  Castle, the palace of the bishops, at a cost of L8000; obtained  Winchester House, Chelsea, for the see; and founded the \"College for  Widows of the Clergy\" near the close at Winchester. He died at Farnham  Castle in 1684. Bishop Morley was an acquaintance of Isaak Walton the  angler, whose guest he was after Parliament had expelled him from his  see. The cathedral library owes its being to a bequest from Morley to  \"the dean and chapter and their successors.\"    #Peter Mews# (1684-1706), bishop of Bath and Wells in 1672, took part  personally in the Civil War, attaining the rank of captain, and followed  Charles II. to Flanders in 1648. Even long after his ordination he  retained his martial spirit, for as bishop of Winchester he personally  took part in the battle of Sedgmoor against the followers of Monmouth  and received a wound. He died in 1706, and was buried in the cathedral.    #Jonathan Trelawney#, Baronet (1707-1721), was one of the famous seven  bishops who underwent trial in the reign of James II. He was before his  occupancy of the see of Winchester, bishop of Bristol and of Exeter.  During his episcopacy, the cathedral received some questionable  adornments, including the \"Grecian\" urns in the niches of the reredos,  now fortunately removed.    #Charles Trimnell# (1721-1723) was a very energetic Whig and a strong  opponent of the once famous Sacheverell. He only spent two years at  Winchester, his term being cut short by death.    #Richard Willis# (1723-1734) was bishop successively of Gloucester,  Salisbury, and Winchester, but he has left little by which he may be  remembered.    #Benjamin Hoadley# (1734-1761) was \"a zealous partisan of religious  liberty,\" and a strenuous Low Churchman. He occupied in turn the  bishoprics of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester. During his  tenure of the first-named see he started the famous Bangorian  Controversy by the publication of a tract and a sermon in which he  denied the existence of a _visible_ Church of Christ in which \"any one  more than another has authority either to make new laws for Christ's  subjects, or to impose a sense upon the old ones, or to judge, censure,  or punish the servants of another master in matters relating purely to  conscience or salvation.\" As a result of the heated discussion of the  matter in Convocation, that body was virtually suspended for a century  and a half. Pope ridicules Hoadley for his verbose eloquence, speaking  of \"Hoadley with his periods of a mile.\" He was, however, a great  favourite of George I., whose private chaplain he became on that king's  accession; and it was under royal protection that he published the works  which gave rise to the great controversy.    #John Thomas# (1761-1781) was tutor to George III. He was called by his  successor \"a man of most amiable character and a polite scholar\"; and it  is difficult to say much more about him.    #Hon. Brownlow North# (1781-1826) was half-brother of Lord North, to  whom he owed a rapid preferment. In 1771, when he was thirty years of  age, he was made bishop of Coventry and Lichfield; in 1774, bishop of  Worcester. At Winchester he spent over L6000 on Farnham Castle, and  during his time L40,000 was devoted to the restoration of the cathedral,  but the result cannot be commended.    #George Pretyman Tomline#, Baronet (1820-1827), had a distinguished  university career and was the author of several theological works.    #Charles Sumner# (1827-1869) came to Winchester after a year at  Llandaff. He was a vigorous supporter of the Evangelical party. During  his term of office the boundaries of his see were re-adjusted and  contracted.    #Samuel Wilberforce# (1869-1873), third son of the celebrated  abolitionist, William Wilberforce, was translated to Winchester from  Oxford, where for twenty-five years he was bishop. His record at  Winchester is neither so long nor so important as at Oxford, where he  successfully passed through the troubles of the Tractarian movement. His  death was occasioned by a fall when he was out riding with Lord  Granville.    Since the death of Bishop Wilberforce the see has been occupied by three  bishops whose names alone need be given here, for their records will be  fresh in the memories of all:--    #Edward Harold Brown# (1873-1890), who came from Ely to Winchester;    #Antony Wilson Thorold# (1890-1895), whose tomb lies outside the  cathedral, close to the new memorial south window of the Lady Chapel;    #Randall Thomas Davidson# (1895), the present occupant of the see.    [Illustration: DETAILS OF THE FONT (also see THE NORMAN FONT in Chapter  III).]          CHAPTER VI    OTHER INSTITUTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE CATHEDRAL      It is hardly possible to conclude an account of Winchester Cathedral  without briefly alluding to several places in the immediate  neighbourhood which are more or less intimately connected with the  church and its benefactors. Only four buildings, however, call for any  detailed description--Wolvesey Castle, the College, Hyde Abbey, and St  Cross.    #Wolvesey#, which is said to mean Wolf's Island, is quite close to the  east end of the cathedral. It contained at one time a regular residence  of the bishops of Winchester, the greater part of which was erected by  Henry de Blois. The remains of this castle are very ruinous, though the  outer walls and the exterior of the keep are in good condition still.  Woodward pointed out traces of a refectory with a Norman arch and  window. The building more than once underwent attacks, the earliest  being during the struggle between Stephen and Matilda, in which Henry de  Blois took a vigorous part. Finally, in 1646, Cromwell practically  destroyed it, after it had held out against him in the Royalist cause.  It served as the residence of many well-known characters in history, and  among its bishops Cardinal Beaufort died there. Mary slept at Wolvesey  Castle in 1554, before her marriage at Winchester. Bishop Morley  commenced building a"]]]
