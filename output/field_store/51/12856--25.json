C is the same leaf turned the other way, and supposed to be  projecting forward; both are exceedingly awkward and unintelligible as  mere outlines, and if expressed in relief would not be any more  convincing as portraits of the thing intended--rather less so, in fact,  than the diagram, which has no projection to interfere with the drawing.  So we must turn our leaf until it presents its long side more or less to  the spectator, as in D; but even here part of the edge is so thin at _a_  that it will be better to turn it a little farther, as in E, showing  more of its surface, as at _b_.    [Illustration: FIG. 71.]    Again, if we take as another example two apples, one partly covering the  other, as in _a_, Fig. 72, where one apple is supposed to be behind the  other, and so implies distance. There is no means of expressing this  distance in carving. Lowering the surface of the hindmost apple would  merely throw out the balance of masses without giving a satisfactory  explanation of its position, while to cut a deep groove between the two  would be an equally unsightly expedient. The difficulty should, whenever  it is possible, be avoided by partially separating the two forms, as in  _b_, where the center of the hindmost apple clears the outline of the  other; thus making it possible to get a division without awkwardness.    [Illustration: FIG. 72.]    [Illustration: FIG. 73.]    A good expedient, where leaf or scroll forms are to be carved, and when  very truthful drawing is necessary to explain their convolutions, is  that adopted by Professor Lethaby at the Royal College of Art. It  consists in cutting the leaf out of a piece of stiffish paper, and with  a knife or pen-handle curling it into the required form. The main lines  will thus be seen in true relation to one another, and all the  distortion avoided which arises from disconnection of parts; not only  that, but it is a useful aid to the invention, as much variety can be  hinted at by a skilful manipulation in curling its lobes. Fig. 73 was  drawn from a paper model of this kind. Of course, it is quite without  the necessary veins or minor articulations, but is useful as a  suggestion of main lines. With regard to subjects containing figures of  men or animals, the same principle governs the placing of the whole body  in the first instance, then of the different members, so that heads,  arms, and legs take up a position as nearly as may be with a piece of  background all to themselves. Thus, no two bodies should be  super-imposed if it can be in any way avoided. (I am speaking now of  moderate and low relief, although even in high relief the best masters  have always respected the principle.) The temptation to imitate effects  of foreshortening for its own sake is not without some excuse, as it is  quite possible to make presentable pictures in this way. A horse, for  instance, may be carved in low relief, presenting either its head or  hindquarters to the spectator, and yet not look absolutely absurd.  Again, a front face may be carved in the same way, notwithstanding the  difficulty presented by the projection of the nose. Neither of these  experiments can ever be said to prove entirely successful. It is not so  much that they are either difficult or impossible, as that a more  suitable method, one more natural to the technique of the carver, is  being neglected, and its many good qualities sacrificed for sake of an  effect which can never be fully realized in sculpture. To so dispose the  various masses, great and small, that they fall easily into groups, each  having some relation to, and share of the background, is a true carver's  artifice. A skilful use of this arrangement makes it quite unnecessary  to encroach upon the domain of another art in the imitation of an  effect which may be successfully rendered with the pencil, but only so  to a very limited extent with the carving tools.    You have all seen the actors, when called before the curtain at the  close of the play, how they pass before it one by one, and perhaps  joining hands make their bows _in line_, to all appearance, on a very  narrow platform. The curtain is your background, while the footlights  may stand for the surface of your wood. In illustration of this  principle, let me call your attention to the arrangement of the animals  in Plate VI, where economy of space, and a desire to display each detail  to advantage, are the leading motives. I give it as the readiest example  to hand, and because it fairly illustrates the principle in question.  You must excuse the apparent vanity in making choice of one of my own  works to exemplify a canon of art. The sheep at the top is supposed to  be scampering over rocks; the ram below may be any distance from the  sheep that you choose to imagine--the only indication of relative  position is _separation_, by means of a ridge that may pass for a rock.  The head of the ram is somewhat foreshortened, but there was enough  thickness of wood contained in the big mass of the body to allow of  this being done in the smaller mass of the head, without leaving too  much to be supposed. The heads of the sheep in the fold have been as  closely packed as was consistent with showing as much of each as  possible, as it was considered better to give the whole head and no body  than to show only a part of both: most of the bodies, therefore, are  supposed to be hidden behind the wall, only one showing in part.    It is a general axiom of the craft, that every mass (be it body or leaf)  must be made as complete in itself as the circumstances will allow; but,  if partly hidden, the concealment should be wilful, and without  ambiguity. Thus, a dog's head may be rightly carved as being partly  hidden in a bucket, but ought not to be covered by another head if it is  possible to avoid it.          CHAPTER XXII    UNDERCUTTING AND \"BUILT-UP\" WORK           Undercutting as a Means and as an End; its Use and       Abuse--\"Built-up\" Work--\"Planted\" Work--\"Pierced\" Work.      By undercutting is meant the cutting away of the solid portions of  projections in such a manner as to make them invisible, thus throwing  the carved surface work into more complete relief by detaching it from  the background. This device has often been carried so far, where the  projection was sufficient, that entire groups of figures and foliage  have been practically detached from the background, like pieces of  separate sculpture carved all round. This desire for completeness of  relief was more or less a departure from the orthodox aims of the  carvers' craft, and led ultimately to what is known as \"built-up\"  work--that is to say, work in which the projecting parts were composed  of many different pieces of wood, each carved separately, and afterward  glued or pinned together to form the composition. Many of the most  elaborate carvings by Grinling Gibbons are of this kind; they have a  charm of their own, but it is one of quite separate interest, and  belongs to a category entirely removed from the art of carving objects  in a solid piece of wood. Apart from this distinction, the difficulty of  the method requires the most accomplished mechanical skill and a highly  trained eye to either carve or compose such work in a way to command  respect. I shall therefore dismiss this branch of the subject as being  outside of our present limits.    Undercutting, on the other hand, is an expedient distinctly  characteristic of solid wood-carving, and some experiments ought to be  made by you in designing work in which it can be used. It may be either  partial or complete--complete, of course, only up to a point; that is to  say, the connection with the background must in every case be not only  maintained but visibly demonstrated. Partial undercutting applies to  such portions as the sides of leaves, the receding parts of heads,  wings, etc., where the wood between the object and its background is cut  away on an inward bend, either completing the projecting form, as in  the case of a head, or merely to hide the superfluous wood in the case  of a leaf. All this presupposes a certain amount of elevation in the  relief; indeed, it is only in such cases that the process is necessary  or can be carried out. The use of undercutting of this kind is like  every other technical process, liable to abuse through too much being  made of its effects. Fortunately the time it consumes is a safeguard  against any tendency to run riot in this direction. The point at which  it should in all cases stop, and that relentlessly, is where it begins  to cause a separation between any entire mass of ornament and its  background. If _portions_ are thus relieved almost to complete  detachment, but visibly reconnect themselves in another place, a certain  piquancy is gained which adds charm without destroying character. A  curious use is made of undercutting in the bunch of leaves given in  Plate XI from a Miserere seat in Winchester Cathedral; it may be said to  be completely undercut in so far that the whole bunch is hollowed out  under the surface, leaving from 1/4 to 1/2 in. thickness of wood, in  which the leaves are carved, so that you may put your finger in at one  hole and see it at the bottom of another. The only end all this extra  labor seems to have attained is that of changefulness in the shadows of  the holes between the leaves, in which one sees dark rims with light at  the bottom, a condition which certainly adds a mysterious lightness to  the whole mass. It is a very refined and appropriate use of  undercutting, but would only be possible where time could be spent to  secure a variant of such epicurean delicacy, as all the superfluous wood  must be taken out through the spaces between the leaves, and in this  case they are not overlarge for that purpose.
