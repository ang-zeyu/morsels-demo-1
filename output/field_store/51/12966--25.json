The main part of  the present inhabitants of the country is composed of the descendants of  these colonists and exiles, of the banished Strelitzes, and of the  captured Swedes and Poles. The varied habits, customs, creeds, ideas,  costumes, and dialects of these motley races have by long contact with  each other become reduced to something like unity. The former extreme  rudeness of the people has also of late years undergone a great  improvement from the influence of new-comers. Still, however, Siberia is  socially any thing but a tolerable country, even in comparison with  Russia, and vices which in enlightened lands would be thought monstrous,  are not occasions of any astonishment or special remark to the mass of  the inhabitants.           *       *       *       *       *    A work by WILLIAM HUMBOLDT, just published at Breslau, excites a good  deal of attention in Germany. It is called _Notions toward an attempt to  define the Boundaries of the Activity of the State_. It was written many  years ago, at the time when the author was intimate with Schiller, who  took an interest in its preparation, but other engagements prevented its  being finished. It is now published exactly from the original  manuscript, under the editorial care of Dr. Edward Cauer. Its doctrinal  starting point is found in the nature and destiny of the individual. Its  philosophy is essentially that of Kant and Fichte, and is of course  liberal in its tendencies, though by no means satisfactory to the  democracy of the present day.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Journal of the Russian Ministry for the Enlightenment of the  People_, for December last, reports a statement made by Mr. Kauwelin to  the Russian Geographical Society in the previous September. The Society  had received, by way of reply to an appeal it had issued, more than five  hundred communications, from various parts of the empire, in relation to  the Sclavonic portion of the people. These documents, as he said,  contain a mass of valuable information, not only as to ethnography, but  also as to Russian archaeology and history. He showed by several examples  how ancient local myths and traditions reached back into remote  antiquity. He proposed the publication of the entire mass of documents,  because \"they enrich history with vivid recollections of the most  ancient ante-historic life-experience of which the traditions of the  non-Sclavonic portion of Europe have preserved only obscure intimations  and vague traces.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hertz, of Berlin, has just published a book which we think can hardly  fail of a speedy reproduction in both English and French. Its title is  _Erinnerungen aus Paris_ (Recollections of Paris) 1817-1848. It is  written by a German lady, who passed these eventful years, or most of  them, in the French capital, and here narrates, in a lively and genial  style, her observations and experiences. She was connected with the  _haute finance_, moved among the lords of the exchange and their  followers, and being endowed by nature with remarkable penetration,  taste for art, no aversion to politics, and a genial social faculty, she  knew all the more prominent personages of the time in public affairs,  society, art, science, and money-making, and brings them before her  readers with great success. Louis XVIII. and the members of his family,  Talleyrand, Decazes, Courier, Constant, Humboldt, Cuvier, Madame  Tallien, De Stael, Delphine Gay, Gerard, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, Liszt,  are among the actors whom she introduces in most real and living  proportions. Here is a charming specimen of her skill in portraiture.  She is speaking of Madame Tallien, then Princess of Chimay, whom she saw  in 1818: \"She was then some forty years old. Her age could to some  extent be arrived at, for it was known that in 1794 she was scarcely  twenty, and her full person, inclining to stoutness, showed that the  first bloom of youth was gone, but it would be difficult again to find  beauty so well preserved, or to meet with a more imposing appearance.  Tall, commanding, radiant, she recalled the historic beauties of  antiquity. So one would imagine Ariadne, Dido, Cleopatra; a perfect  bust, shoulders, and arms; white as an animated statue, regular  features, flashing eyes, pearly teeth, hair of raven blackness, hers was  a mien, speech, and movement, which ravished every beholder.\" Had we  space we might give some longer translations from this interesting  volume, for which our readers would thank us, but we must forbear.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LATEST GERMAN NOVELS.--Theodore Muegge, who is somewhat known in this  country through Dr. Furness's translation of his novel on Toussaint  L'Ouverture, has published at Ensleben _Koenig Jacob's Letzte Tage_ (the  Last Days of King James), a historical romance, with the English James  II. for its hero. The principal characters, that of the King, of  Jeffreys, and William of Orange, are drawn successfully. The critics  complain, however, that it lacks continuous interest, and a continuous  and connected plot. To understand it, one must have a history of the  period at hand to refer to. Muegge is not a great romancer, even for  Germany. In politics he is one of those democrats who would yet have a  hereditary chief at the head of the government. Glimpses of this  tendency appear in this novel. Arnold Ruge has also spent a portion of  his enforced leisure (he is an exile at London) in writing a romance  called the _Demokrat_, which he has published in Germany, along  with some previous similar productions, under the title of  _Revolutions-Novellen_. It is full of Ruge's keen, logical talent, and  on-rushing energy, but is deficient in esthetic beauty and interest. He  never forgets the Hegelian dialectics even when he writes novels.  _Clemens Metternich_, _and Ludwig Kossuth_, by Siegmund Kolisch, is a  skilfully done but not great production. Uffo Horn has a new series of  tales, which he calls _Aus drei Iahrhunderten_ (From three Centuries.)  They are stories of 1690, 1756, and 1844, and are worth reading. Horn  seizes with success upon the features of an epoch, but is not so good in  depicting individual character. The _Freischaren Novellen_ (Free-corp  Novels) of W. Hamm, are stories of modern warlike life, and are written  with point and spirit. Stifter has published the sixth volume of his  _Studien_, which, to those who know this charming off-shoot of the  disappearing romantic school, it is high praise to say, is as good as  any of the former volumes, if not better. Stifter always keeps himself  remote from the agitations of the time, and sings his song, and weaves  his still and lovely enchantments, as if they were not. This new volume  contains a complete romance, the _Zwei Schwestern_ (Two Sisters), which  cannot be read without touching the inmost heart, while it delights the  fancy. Spindler has a humorous novel, whose hero, a travelling clerk or  bagman, meets with a variety of amusing adventures. Like many other  books of the comical order, it is tedious when taken in large doses. The  reader, at first amused, soon lays it down. Caroline von Goehren appears  with a series of _Novellen_, which receive no great commendation. The  _Ostergabe_ (Easter Gift), by Frederica Bremer, which has just appeared  in Germany, is spoken of as her best production. It contains pictures of  northern life, and of those domestic influences which Miss Bremer so  delights to glorify. The _Gesammelte Erzaehlungen_ (Collected Tales) of  W. G. von Horn, lately published at Frankfort, are worth the attention  of those whose novel reading is not confined to our own language. The  style is clear and pleasing, and the characters full of truth and  naturalness. The _Erzaehlungen aus dem Volksleben der Schwerz_ (Tales of  Popular Life in Switzerland) by Ieremias Gotthelf, also deserves a  respectful mention. Gotthelf is a religious moralist, who sets forth the  doctrines of virtue, religious trust in God, and the blessed influence  of domestic life, in a pleasing and effective manner.           *       *       *       *       *    DR. SCHAeFFNER'S _Geschichte der Rechtsverfassung Frankreichs_ (\"History  of French Law\"), just published, is noticed with high praise by the  _Frankfurt Oberpostamts Zeitung_. The work has just been completed by  the publication of the fourth volume, which only confirms the reputation  which the earlier portions gained for the author among the jurists of  all Europe. Dr. Schaeffner, with equal learning and perspicacity, sets  forth the relation of French law, and the changes it has undergone, to  the history of the political institutions of the country. In this  respect the work interests a much wider public than is ordinarily  addressed by a juridical treatise. It opens with an account of the  conflict between the elements of Roman and German law in France. Then it  exposes the establishment of the feudal aristocracy and its contests  with the power of the Church; next, the culmination of the royal  authority, based on a bureaucratic administration, its final fall into  the hands of the triumphant revolution, and its subjection to the  various powers that have succeeded each other within the last sixty  years. The fourth and last volume contains the history of the  Constitution, of Law, and of the administration from the revolution of  1789 to the revolution of 1848. Dr. Schaeffner exhibits in this volume no  admiration for the various attempts to re-create the State according to  abstract theories; he goes altogether for moderate progress, gradual  reform, and keeping up the relation between the present and the past.           *       *       *       *       *    The fate of BONPLAND, the eminent traveller and naturalist, is a topic  of discussion in Germany.

E. Jensen, who had seen service in the South  African War, and was one of the most promising of the junior officers,  was shot through the face when standing on the firestep instructing one  of his platoon. He died a few hours later.    The hours of darkness were punctuated by short bursts of machine gun  fire and occasional rifle shots at movement, or suspected movement, on  the other side. Now and then one of our guns would send a shell over  towards the Turks. Subsequent experience showed that at night time the  enemy rarely replied to these, as he feared that the flashes from his  artillery would disclose his positions and thus afford an opportunity to  the watching Navy with its heavier weapons.    Every soldier in the front trenches was alert. Post commanders moved  about supervising, and the attached New Zealanders imparted useful  information in regard to trench warfare methods, such as how to outwit  the wily Turk; the essential discipline; and precautions to ensure  safety to the individual. Opportunity of gaining an acquaintance with  No-Man's Land was afforded through the necessity of examining and  repairing the protective wire entanglements, which were thrown out in  front and consisted of a few strands of barbed wire and French wire very  imperfectly secured. Now and then senior officers passed down the  forward trench intent on seeing that the general plan of defence was  being adhered to.    Dawn brought increased activity. At that hour--the then accepted hour  for an attack--every man in the Battalion was awake and stood at his  post fully armed and equipped. This state of readiness was referred to  in \"orders\" as the \"Stand To,\" and was observed morning and evening.  Thus the soldier remained until some 30 minutes later, when the order  \"Stand Down\" was passed along. On such occasions the absence of fuss and  noise in movement, it is generally agreed, is an indication that a unit  is well disciplined. One of our battalions momentarily went astray in  this respect, and its men in the front trenches, early one morning, were  treated to an unexpected touch of humour on the part of the enemy, from  whose locality a voice, in more or less perfect English, was heard  calling \"Stand to, --th Battalion!\"    [Illustration: IN THE FRONT LINE AT THE APEX.  _Photo. lent by Mr. A. J. Shipway._]    To the 28th the \"Stand Down\" brought some relaxation, both mental and  physical, as the rising of the sun restored sight to the sentries and  imparted increased confidence to the whole. Light revealed rather a  marked change in the appearance of individuals. The chill of the night  air had impelled many to put on their greatcoats. Some had even donned  their Balaclava caps, which, showing only the eyes, nose, and mouth of  the wearer, and surmounted by a hat or cap, gave a grotesque effect.  Clothing smeared with earth, eyes bloodshot for want of sleep, and  scrubby chins disclosed the need and benefit of, amongst other things, a  wash. Water for this was, however, not available except in small  quantities, and the man was lucky who secured one that day. The next  best thing was a meal, and this consisted of army biscuit and tinned  meat (bully beef) washed down by a small quantity of tea, which the  Quartermaster had sent up hot but which reached those who needed it in a  lukewarm condition.    [Illustration: EXCAVATING A \"BIVVY\" IN THE SUPPORT TRENCHES, THE APEX.  _Photo. lent by Mrs. H. Simm._]    Following that was the cleaning up of the trenches. This consisted of  collecting all scraps of food, empty tins, bits of paper, etc., and  removing from the floor the debris that had fallen from the walls, or  parapet and parados, during the previous 24 hours. Then came attention  to rifle and bayonet, which were to be kept free of obstruction and  rust. The reserve ammunition and bombs, some of which were open to the  air, had also to be wiped free of verdigris and dust so that they would  not jam or clog when required for use. This daily cleaning up had become  almost a fetish in the army, but it undoubtedly engendered habits of  orderliness--thereby promoting efficiency, and also had a material  effect on the health of the individual by keeping down the flies, which  would swarm around any tins or other receptacles which had contained  food, or any of the food itself.    This day brought the Battalion for the first time under direct artillery  fire. It was the enemy's custom to indulge in a \"hate\" morning and  afternoon. This would take the form of a bombardment of from 20 to 80  rounds of 77 millimeter shrapnel and high explosive shells. Large  calibre guns were not directed on the Apex whilst the Battalion was  stationed there. With the high explosive projectiles was used a  percussion fuse, and these were intended more for the demolition of  works than man killing. Actually they did little damage and, except on  one occasion when a direct hit was secured in a machine gun emplacement,  no one was injured. Shrapnel was used in a different manner, and was far  more dangerous. The fuse was for time, and the range and fuse were so  harmonised that the shell burst in the air, short of and above the  target, thus allowing the bullets it contained to sweep forward and  downward, spreading out fan-like as they progressed. Many of the small  missiles thus entered the trenches, but by keeping close to the forward  wall of the excavations immunity from damage was generally secured to  the individual. Occasionally the Turk threw in a few rounds from a  mountain gun which he had secreted somewhere on the slope of Sari Bair.  These simply whizzed through the air and buried themselves in the earth  without doing any damage to either man or trench.    The 28th stood its baptism of fire well, and was more curious than  alarmed at the noise, smoke, and earth upheavals caused by the enemy's  action. Some of the men early disclosed the possession of the \"souvenir\"  habit by collecting specimens of the shrapnel pellets. Unfortunately  that portion of the Battalion in reserve, not being under any cover  except a slight fold in the ground, sustained a few casualties by  wounds.    Early in the morning the Brigadier paid a visit to the lines and was  indefatigable in his zeal for the safety of the position and the welfare  of his command. Throughout the short period of his stay on the Peninsula  his characteristics in this respect were most marked and, for a man of  his advanced years, the wonders he achieved in hill climbing, and the  risks he ran from enemy snipers, were a subject of frequent comment.    About noon the Battalion made the acquaintance of Sir William Birdwood,  who went through the trenches accompanied by Sir Alexander Godley and a  staff officer. His attractive personality, unassuming manner, and his  kindly and tactful inquiries, instantly earned the regard of the  newcomers. A particular incident which occurred that morning may serve  to illustrate his general attitude. He came to a Western Australian and  a New Zealander standing together. To the W.A. man he said, \"Are you  28th?\" Receiving an affirmative answer the General placed a hand on the  man's shoulder and remarked, \"We are very glad you've come. You know  what your comrades of the 1st Division have done, and we know that, when  the time arrives, you will do the same.\" Then placing the other hand on  the Maori's shoulder, he concluded, \"And you can show him how to do it,  can't you?\"    Of a different disposition, the Divisional Commander contented himself,  during his first visit, with merely observing and asking a question here  and there. His subsequent visits were frequent and seldom welcomed by  the rank and file, who found him awe-inspiring and hypercritical. He  was, however, known to unbend and show generous appreciation of honest  effort and good work. On rare occasions he unexpectedly revealed the  possession of a sense of humour.    Other visitors came on this first day. From the 10th Light Horse, which  was located near the Sazli Beit Dere; from the 11th and 12th Battalions,  holding the line far down on the right; from the 16th Battalion,  awaiting embarkation for Lemnos Island, where they were to have a  well-earned rest; and from the 8th Battery, also with the 1st Division.  These came to see relatives and friends in order to exchange news of  home and of pals who had gone under or been wounded. With the advent of  the 2nd Division began a system of transfer of individuals of one unit  to another whereby an elder brother, say, in the 11th Battalion, could  apply for permission for a younger brother who had arrived in the, say,  28th Battalion, to join him. If the younger brother was agreeable to the  change, approval for the transfer was seldom withheld.    When the line was \"quiet\" the men were enabled to examine the enemy's  positions with the aid of periscopes. No signs of movement could be  discerned, but the long lines of trenches rising tier above tier on the  opposite hillsides indicated how difficult would be the task should a  further advance be ordered. The observers on Nos. 2 and 3 Posts mostly  concentrated their attention on the ground in the vicinity of the  Pinnacle. From there a sniper was taking shots at any object which  appeared above our parapets or at a loophole. Very rapid and accurate as  he was, it was soon found that a certain amount of skill was required to  camouflage and look through a periscope without having one's eyes  destroyed with broken glass. A small Union Jack, mounted on a stick less  than half an inch in diameter, was cut down at the sniper's first  attempt.    In No-man's Land, in front of the two posts mentioned, could be seen the  remains of a trench dug by the New Zealanders in their August advance.  This they had been compelled to abandon together with their dead  comrades who lay about, still unburied, rapidly decomposing in the sun  which yet retained the"]]]
