I know this will seem heresy to many  Sanskrit scholars, but we must try to be honest to ourselves. Is there  any evidence to constrain us to assign the Manava-dharma-_s_astra,  such as we now possess it, written in continuous _S_lokas, to any date  anterior to 300 A.D.? And if there is not, why should we not openly  state it, challenge opposition, and feel grateful if our doubts can be  removed?    That Manu was a name of high legal authority before that time, and  that Manu and the Manavam are frequently quoted in the ancient legal  Sutras, is quite true; but this serves only to confirm the conviction  that the literature which succeeded the Turanian invasion is full of  wrecks saved from the intervening deluge. If what we call the _Laws of  Manu_ had really existed as a code of laws, like the Code of  Justinian, during previous centuries, is it likely that it should  nowhere have been quoted and appealed to?    Varahamihira (who died 587 A.D.) refers to Manu several times, but not  to a Manava-dharma-_s_astra; and the only time where he seems actually  to quote a number of verses from Manu, these verses are not to be met  with in our text.[107]    I believe it will be found that the century in which Varahamihara  lived and wrote was the age of the literary Renaissance in India.[108]  That Kalidasa and Bharavi were famous at that time, we know from the  evidence of inscriptions. We also know that during that century the  fame of Indian literature had reached Persia, and that the King of  Persia, Khosru Nushirvan, sent his physician, Barzoi, to India, in  order to translate the fables of the Pa_nk_atantra, or rather their  original, from Sanskrit into Pahlavi. The famous \"Nine Gems,\" or  \"the nine classics,\" as we should say, have been referred, at least in  part, to the same age,[109] and I doubt whether we shall be able to  assign a much earlier date to anything we possess of Sanskrit  literature, excepting always the Vedic and Buddhistic writings.    Although the specimens of this modern Sanskrit literature, when they  first became known, served to arouse a general interest, and serve  even now to keep alive a certain superficial sympathy for Indian  literature, more serious students had soon disposed of these  compositions, and while gladly admitting their claim to be called  pretty and attractive, could not think of allowing to Sanskrit  literature a place among the world-literatures, a place by the side of  Greek and Latin, Italian, French, English, or German.    There was indeed a time when people began to imagine that all that was  worth knowing about Indian literature was known, and that the only  ground on which Sanskrit could claim a place among the recognized  branches of learning in a university was its usefulness for the study  of the Science of Language.    At that very time, however, now about forty years ago, a new start was  made, which has given to Sanskrit scholarship an entirely new  character. The chief author of that movement was Burnouf, then  professor at the _College de France_ in Paris, an excellent scholar,  but at the same time a man of wide views and true historical  instincts, and the last man to waste his life on mere Nalas and  _S_akuntalas. Being brought up in the old traditions of the classical  school in France (his father was the author of the well-known Greek  Grammar), then for a time a promising young barrister, with  influential friends such as Guizot, Thiers, Mignet, Villemain, at his  side, and with a brilliant future before him, he was not likely to  spend his life on pretty Sanskrit ditties. What he wanted when he  threw himself on Sanskrit was history, human history, world-history,  and with an unerring grasp he laid hold of Vedic literature and  Buddhist literature, as the two stepping-stones in the slough of  Indian literature. He died young, and has left a few arches only of  the building he wished to rear. But his spirit lived on in his pupils  and his friends, and few would deny that the first impulse, directly  or indirectly, to all that has been accomplished since by the students  of Vedic and Buddhist literature, was given by Burnouf and his  lectures at the _College de France_.    What then, you may ask, do we find in that ancient Sanskrit literature  and cannot find anywhere else? My answer is: We find there the Aryan  man, whom we know in his various characters, as Greek, Roman, German,  Celt, and Slave, in an entirely new character. Whereas in his  migrations northward his active and political energies are called out  and brought to their highest perfection, we find the other side of the  human character, the passive and meditative, carried to its fullest  growth in India. In some of the hymns of the Rig-Veda we can still  watch an earlier phase. We see the Aryan tribes taking possession of  the land, and under the guidance of such warlike gods as Indra and the  Maruts, defending their new homes against the assaults of the  black-skinned aborigines as well as against the inroads of later Aryan  colonists. But that period of war soon came to an end, and when the  great mass of the people had once settled down in their homesteads,  the military and political duties seem to have been monopolized by  what we call a _caste_,[110] that is by a small aristocracy, while the  great majority of the people were satisfied with spending their days  within the narrow spheres of their villages, little concerned about  the outside world, and content with the gifts that nature bestowed on  them, without much labor. We read in the Mahabharata (XIII. 22):        \"There is fruit on the trees in every forest, which every one      who likes may pluck without trouble. There is cool and sweet      water in the pure rivers here and there. There is a soft bed      made of the twigs of beautiful creepers. And yet wretched      people suffer pain at the door of the rich!\"    At first sight we may feel inclined to call this quiet enjoyment of  life, this mere looking on, a degeneracy rather than a growth. It  seems so different from what _we_ think life ought to be. Yet, from a  higher point of view it may appear that those Southern Aryans have  chosen the good part, or at least the part good for them, while we,  Northern Aryans, have been careful and troubled about many things.    It is at all events a problem worth considering whether, as there is  in nature a South and a North, there are not two hemispheres also in  human nature, both worth developing--the active, combative, and  political on one side, the passive, meditative, and philosophical on  the other; and for the solution of that problem no literature  furnishes such ample materials as that of the Veda, beginning with the  Hymns and ending with the Upanishads. We enter into a new world--not  always an attractive one, least of all to us; but it possesses one  charm, it is real, it is of natural growth, and like everything of  natural growth, I believe it had a hidden purpose, and was intended to  teach us some kind of lesson that is worth learning, and that  certainly we could learn nowhere else. We are not called upon either  to admire or to despise that ancient Vedic literature; we have simply  to study and to try to understand it.    There have been silly persons who have represented the development of  the Indian mind as superior to any other, nay, who would make us go  back to the Veda or to the sacred writings of the Buddhists in order  to find there a truer religion, a purer morality, and a more sublime  philosophy than our own. I shall not even mention the names of these  writers or the titles of their works. But I feel equally impatient  when I see other scholars criticising the ancient literature of India  as if it were the work of the nineteenth century, as if it represented  an enemy that must be defeated, and that can claim no mercy at our  hands. That the Veda is full of childish, silly, even to our minds  monstrous conceptions, who would deny? But even these monstrosities  are interesting and instructive; nay, many of them, if we can but make  allowance for different ways of thought and language, contain germs of  truth and rays of light, all the more striking because breaking upon  us through the veil of the darkest night.    Here lies the general, the truly human interest which the _ancient_  literature of India possesses, and which gives it a claim on the  attention, not only of Oriental scholars or of students of ancient  history, but of every educated man and woman.    There are problems which we may put aside for a time, ay, which we  must put aside while engaged each in our own hard struggle for life,  but which will recur for all that, and which, whenever they do recur,  will stir us more deeply than we like to confess to others, or even to  ourselves. It is true that with us one day only out of seven is set  apart for rest and meditation, and for the consideration of what the  Greeks called [Greek: ta megista]--\"the greatest things.\"  It is true that that seventh day also is passed by many of us either  in mere church-going routine or in thoughtless rest. But whether on  week-days or on Sundays, whether in youth or in old age, there are  moments, rare though they be, yet for all that the most critical  moments of our life, when the old simple questions of humanity return  to us in all their intensity, and we ask ourselves, What are we? What  is this life on earth meant for? Are we to have no rest here, but to  be always toiling and building up our own happiness out of the ruins  of the happiness of our neighbors? And when we have made our home on  earth as comfortable as it can be made with steam and gas and  electricity, are we really so much happier than the Hindu in his  primitive homestead?

This is very likely to occur when the vessel used is  perfectly smooth and the solution is not disturbed in any way. Such a  solution is said to be _supersaturated_. That this condition is unstable  can be shown by adding a crystal of the solid to the solution. All of  the solid in excess of the quantity required to saturate the solution at  this temperature will at once crystallize out, leaving the solution  saturated. Supersaturation may also be overcome in many cases by  vigorously shaking or stirring the solution.    ~General physical properties of solutions.~ A few general statements may  be made in reference to the physical properties of solutions.    1. _Distribution of the solid in the liquid._ A solid, when dissolved,  tends to distribute itself uniformly through the liquid, so that every  part of the solution has the same concentration. The process goes on  very slowly unless hastened by stirring or shaking the solution. Thus,  if a few crystals of a highly colored substance such as copper sulphate  are placed in the bottom of a tall vessel full of water, it will take  weeks for the solution to become uniformly colored.    2. _Boiling points of solutions._ The boiling point of a liquid is  raised by the presence of a substance dissolved in it. In general the  extent to which the boiling point of a solvent is raised by a given  substance is proportional to the concentration of the solution, that  is, to the weight of the substance dissolved in a definite weight of the  solvent.    3. _Freezing points of solutions._ A solution freezes at a lower  temperature than the pure solvent. The lowering of the freezing point  obeys the same law which holds for the raising of the boiling point: the  extent of lowering is proportional to the weight of dissolved substance,  that is, to the concentration of the solution.    ~Electrolysis of solutions.~ Pure water does not appreciably conduct the  electric current. If, however, certain substances such as common salt  are dissolved in the water, the resulting solutions are found to be  conductors of electricity. Such solutions are called _electrolytes_.  When the current passes through an electrolyte some chemical change  always takes place. This change is called _electrolysis_.    [Illustration: Fig. 31]    The general method used in the electrolysis of a solution is illustrated  in Fig. 31. The vessel D contains the electrolyte. Two plates or rods,  A and B, made of suitable material, are connected with the wires  from a battery (or dynamo) and dipped into the electrolyte, as shown in  the figure. These plates or rods are called _electrodes_. The electrode  connected with the zinc plate of the battery is the negative electrode  or _cathode_, while that connected with the carbon plate is the positive  electrode or _anode_.    ~Theory of electrolytic dissociation.~ The facts which have just been  described in connection with solutions, together with many others, have  led chemists to adopt a theory of solutions called _the theory of  electrolytic dissociation_. The main assumptions in this theory are the  following.    1. _Formation of ions._ Many compounds when dissolved in water undergo  an important change. A portion of their molecules fall apart, or  _dissociate_, into two or more parts, called _ions_. Thus sodium nitrate  (NaNO_{3}) dissociates into the ions Na and NO_{3}; sodium chloride,  into the ions Na and Cl. These ions are free to move about in the  solution independently of each other like independent molecules, and for  this reason were given the name ion, which signifies a wanderer.    2. _The electrical charge of ions._ Each ion carries a heavy electrical  charge, and in this respect differs from an atom or molecule. It is  evident that the sodium in the form of an ion must differ in some  important way from ordinary sodium, for sodium ions, formed from sodium  nitrate, give no visible evidence of their presence in water, whereas  metallic sodium at once decomposes the water. The electrical charge,  therefore, greatly modifies the usual chemical properties of the  element.    3. _The positive charges equal the negative charges._ The ions formed by  the dissociation of any molecule are of two kinds. One kind is charged  with positive electricity and the other with negative electricity;  moreover the sum of all the positive charges is always equal to the sum  of all the negative charges. The solution as a whole is therefore  electrically neutral. If we represent dissociation by the usual chemical  equations, with the electrical charges indicated by + and - signs  following the symbols, the dissociation of sodium chloride molecules is  represented thus:        NaCl --> Na^{+}, Cl^{-}.    The positive charge on each sodium ion exactly equals the negative  charge on each chlorine ion. Sodium sulphate dissociates, as shown in  the equation        Na_{2}SO_{4} --> 2Na^{+}, SO_{4}^{--}.    Here the positive charge on the two sodium ions equals the double  negative charge on the SO_{4} ion.    4. _Not all compounds dissociate._ Only those compounds dissociate whose  solutions form electrolytes. Thus salt dissociates when dissolved in  water, the resulting solution being an electrolyte. Sugar, on the other  hand, does not dissociate and its solution is not a conductor of the  electric current.    5. _Extent of dissociation differs in different liquids._ While  compounds most readily undergo dissociation in water, yet dissociation  often occurs to a limited extent when solution takes place in liquids  other than water. In the discussion of solutions it will be understood  that the solvent is water unless otherwise noted.    ~The theory of electrolytic dissociation and the properties of solutions.~  In order to be of value, this theory must give a reasonable explanation  of the properties of solutions. Let us now see if the theory is in  harmony with certain of these properties.    ~The theory of electrolytic dissociation and the boiling and freezing  points of solutions.~ We have seen that the boiling point of a solution  of a substance is raised in proportion to the concentration of the  dissolved substance. This is but another way of saying that the change  in the boiling point of the solution is proportional to the number of  molecules of the dissolved substance present in the solution.    It has been found, however, that in the case of electrolytes the boiling  point is raised more than it should be to conform to this law. If the  solute dissociates into ions, the reason for this becomes clear. Each  ion has the same effect on the boiling point as a molecule, and since  their number is greater than the number of molecules from which they  were formed, the effect on the boiling point is abnormally great.    In a similar way, the theory furnishes an explanation of the abnormal  lowering of the freezing point of electrolytes.    ~The theory of electrolytic dissociation and electrolysis.~ The changes  taking place during electrolysis harmonize very completely with the  theory of dissociation. This will become clear from a study of the  following examples.    [Illustration: Fig. 32]    1. _Electrolysis of sodium chloride._ Fig. 32 represents a vessel in  which the electrolyte is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). According  to the dissociation theory the molecules of sodium chloride dissociate  into the ions Na^{+} and Cl^{-}. The Na^{+} ions are attracted to the  cathode owing to its large negative charge. On coming into contact with  the cathode, the Na^{+} ions give up their positive charge and are then  ordinary sodium atoms. They immediately decompose the water according to  the equation        Na + H_{2}O = NaOH + H,    and hydrogen is evolved about the cathode.    The chlorine ions on being discharged at the anode in similar manner may  either be given off as chlorine gas, or may attack the water, as  represented in the equation        2Cl + H_{2}O = 2HCl + O.    2. _Electrolysis of water._ The reason for the addition of sulphuric  acid to water in the preparation of oxygen and hydrogen by electrolysis  will now be clear. Water itself is not an electrolyte to an appreciable  extent; that is, it does not form enough ions to carry a current.  Sulphuric acid dissolved in water is an electrolyte, and dissociates  into the ions 2 H^{+} and SO_{4}^{--}. In the process of electrolysis of  the solution, the hydrogen ions travel to the cathode, and on being  discharged escape as hydrogen gas. The SO_{4} ions, when discharged at  the anode, act upon water, setting free oxygen and once more forming  sulphuric acid:        SO_{4} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4} + O.    The sulphuric acid can again dissociate and the process repeat itself as  long as any water is left. Hence the hydrogen and oxygen set free in the  electrolysis of water really come directly from the acid but indirectly  from the water.    3. _Electrolysis of sodium sulphate._ In a similar way, sodium sulphate  (Na_{2}SO_{4}), when in solution, gives the ions 2 Na^{+} and  SO_{4}^{--}. On being discharged, the sodium atoms decompose water about  the cathode, as in the case of sodium chloride, while the SO_{4} ions  when discharged at the anode decompose the water, as represented in the  equation        SO_{4} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4} + O    [Illustration: Fig. 33]    That new substances are formed at the cathode and anode may be shown in  the following way. A U-tube, such as is represented in Fig. 33, is  partially filled with a solution of sodium sulphate, and the liquid in  one arm is colored with red litmus, that in the other with blue litmus.  An electrode placed in the red solution is made to serve as cathode,  while one in the blue solution is made the anode. On allowing the  current to pass, the blue solution turns red, while the red solution  turns blue. These are exactly the changes which would take place if  sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid were to be set free at the  electrodes, as required by "]]]
