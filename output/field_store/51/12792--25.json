The text of the       secret documents, which, according to the German contention,       prove that the Allies did not intend to respect Belgian       neutrality--that Belgium herself conspired with England to       break it--was discovered in the archives of the Belgian       Government after the German occupation of Brussels, and is       embodied on Pages 1105 to 1109 in the subjoined article,       published in behalf of Germany by Dr. Bernhard Dernburg.         The article, called by Dr. Dernburg \"The Case of Belgium,\"       as reproduced below, and published between gray covers like       the Belgian \"Gray Book,\" prompted publications in rejoinder       by the Belgian Legation at Washington. The first of these,       entitled \"The Innocence of Belgium,\" appears on Page 1110;       it states that the secret documents show in their own       statements the \"clearest proof of the innocence of Belgium.\"       The second Belgian article, headed \"Why Belgium Was       Devastated,\" and appearing on Page 1115, embodies the German       proclamations establishing military rule in the violated       territory.--EDITOR.]      \"THE CASE OF BELGIUM\"    \"In the Light of Official Reports Found in the Secret Archives of the  Belgian Government after the Occupation of Brussels\"    Remarks Introductory to the Secret Documents    By Dr. Bernhard Dernburg    Herewith are published facsimiles of papers found among the documents  of the Belgian General Staff at Brussels, referring to arrangements  between the English Military Attache and the Belgian Minister of War  regarding British intervention in Belgium.    It will be remembered from the British \"White Book\" that in November,  1912, a correspondence passed between Sir Edward Grey and the French  Minister in London, in which it was stated that British and French  military and naval experts had consulted together from time to time as  to plans to be followed in case of war, and it was stated in this  correspondence that in accordance with such prearranged plans the  French fleet would stay in the Mediterranean to safeguard the joint  interests there, whereas the British fleet would safeguard their  interests in the north. Of this correspondence the members of the  British Cabinet remained ignorant until the Cabinet meeting  immediately preceding the written statement by Great Britain on Aug. 2  that in case a German fleet attacked the French coast or passed into  the Channel, England would give all the assistance in her power,  (British \"White Papers,\" No. 148,) and it was also, of course,  concealed from the British public until the speech of Sir Edward Grey  on Aug. 3. It will be remembered that in consequence of this  revelation the British Minister of Commerce, Mr. John Burns, and two  other members, Lord Morley and Mr. Trevelyan, left the British Cabinet  under protest; that the leader of the British Labor Party, Mr. Ramsey  Macdonald, resigned from the leadership and that Mr. Arthur Ponsonby  in his famous letter denounced Sir Edward Grey's practices.    Mr. Ponsonby said that time and again they had been assured that there  were no obligations whatsoever on the part of Great Britain to come to  France's assistance and yet they found themselves now so hopelessly  entangled that as a matter of fact the British Government could not  back out.    The fact of these consultations, by which, of course, all the plans of  mobilization of both the British and French armies were disclosed to  the two allies and which include the landing of English troops in  France, is now fully established by the annexed documents. They show  that these conversations were also held with Belgium, that plans had  been concerted to invade Belgium with an army of 100,000 men by way of  three French ports--viz., Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne--and that the  British plans even considered a landing by way of the Scheldt, thus  violating also Dutch neutrality.    The documents, giving all the details as translated and showing that  Belgian railway cars were to be sent to the named French ports in  order to transport the British troops into Belgium, are dated from  1906.    The Belgian Minister at Berlin, Baron Greindl, a well-known Belgian  patriot, protested to his Government. The heading of his protest is  also given in facsimile. In it he said that it was not quite safe to  trust to the British and French to keep the Belgian neutrality, that  it was not wise to take all measures only against a German infraction  of Belgian neutrality and that the British spirit was clearly shown by  the words of Col. Barnardiston that the Scheldt might be used for  transporting troops into Belgium.    Furthermore, it will be remembered that the British and French  Governments violently protested when the plans were made public that  the Dutch Government intended to fortify the mouth of the Scheldt in  1906. But in 1912, when the Balkan crisis became acute, the British  went one step further. When Col. Bridges, in a conversation with Gen.  Jungbluth, the Chief of the Belgian General Staff, said that England  was ready to strike, that 160,000 men were ready to be landed and that  they would land them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#19)"],[1,".    Ukridge sprang at the letter.    \"If that demon doesn't stop writing letters and upsetting Millie I  shall lynch her,\" he said. I had never seen him so genuinely angry. He  turned over the pages till he came to the passage which had caused the  trouble. \"Listen to this, Garnet. 'I'm sorry, but not surprised, to  hear that the chicken farm is not proving a great success. I think you  know my opinion of your husband. He is perfectly helpless in any  matter requiring the exercise of a little common sense and business  capability.' I like that! 'Pon my soul, I like that! You've known me  longer than she has, Garny, and you know that it's just in matters  requiring common sense that I come out strong. What?\"    \"Of course, old man,\" I replied dutifully. \"The woman must be a fool.\"    \"That's what she calls me two lines farther on. No wonder Millie was  upset. Why can't these cats leave people alone?\"    \"O woman, woman!\" I threw in helpfully.    \"Always interfering--\"    \"Beastly!\"    \"--and backbiting--\"    \"Awful!\"    \"I shan't stand it!\"    \"I shouldn't.\"    \"Look here! On the next page she calls me a gaby!\"    \"It's time you took a strong hand.\"    \"And in the very next sentence refers to me as a perfect guffin.  What's a guffin, Garny, old boy?\"    \"It sounds indecent.\"    \"I believe it's actionable.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder.\"    Ukridge rushed to the door.    \"Millie!\" he shouted.    No answer.    He slammed the door, and I heard him dashing upstairs.    I turned with a sense of relief to my letters. One was from Lickford.  It bore a Cornish postmark. I glanced through it, and laid it aside  for a more exhaustive perusal later on.    The other was in a strange handwriting. I looked at the signature.  Patrick Derrick. This was queer. What had the professor to say to me?    The next moment my heart seemed to spring to my throat.    \"Sir,\" the letter began.    A pleasant, cheery beginning!    Then it got off the mark, so to speak, like lightning. There was no  sparring for an opening, no dignified parade of set phrases leading up  to the main point. It was the letter of a man who was almost too  furious to write. It gave me the impression that, if he had not  written it, he would have been obliged to have taken some very violent  form of exercise by way of relief to his soul.    \"You will be good enough,\" he wrote, \"to look on our acquaintance as  closed. I have no wish to associate with persons of your stamp. If we  should happen to meet, you will be good enough to treat me as a total  stranger, as I shall treat you. And, if I may be allowed to give you a  word of advice, I should recommend you in future, when you wish to  exercise your humor, to do so in some less practical manner than by  bribing boatmen to upset your\" (_friends_ crossed out thickly, and  _acquaintances_ substituted). \"If you require further enlightenment in  this matter, the inclosed letter may be of service to you.\"    With which he remained mine faithfully, Patrick Derrick.    The inclosed letter was from one Jane Muspratt. It was bright and  interesting.         DEAR SIR: My Harry, Mr. Hawk, sas to me how it was him       upseting the boat and you, not because he is not steddy in a       boat which he is no man more so in Lyme Regis but because       one of the gentmen what keeps chikkens up the hill, the       little one, Mr. Garnick his name is, says to him Hawk, I'll       give you a sovrin to upset Mr. Derrick in your boat, and my       Harry being esily led was took in and did but he's sory now       and wishes he hadn't, and he sas he'll niver do a prackticle       joke again for anyone even for a bank note.    Yours obedly    JANE MUSPRATT.    O woman, woman!    At the bottom of everything! History is full of cruel tragedies caused  by the lethal sex.    Who lost Mark Antony the world? A woman. Who let Samson in so  atrociously? Woman again. Why did Bill Bailey leave home? Once more,  because of a woman. And here was I, Jerry Garnet, harmless,  well-meaning writer of minor novels, going through the same old mill.    I cursed Jane Muspratt. What chance had I with Phyllis now? Could I  hope to win over the professor again? I cursed Jane Muspratt for the  second time.    My thoughts wandered to Mr. Harry Hawk. The villain! The scoundrel!  What business had he to betray me? Well, I could settle with him. The  man who lays a hand upon a woman, save in the way of kindness, is  justly disliked by society; so the woman Muspratt, culpable as she  was, was safe from me. But what of the man Hawk? There no such  considerations swayed me. I would interview the man Hawk. I would give  him the most hectic ten minutes of his career. I would say things to  him the recollection of which would make him start up shrieking in his  bed in the small hours of the night. I would arise, and be a man and  slay him--take him grossly, full of bread, with all his crimes,  broad-blown, as flush as May; at gaming, swearing, or about some act  that had no relish of salvation in it.    The demon!    My life--ruined. My future--gray and blank. My heart--shattered. And  why? Because of the scoundrel--Hawk.    Phyllis would meet me in the village, on the Cob, on the links, and  pass by as if I were the invisible man. And why? Because of the  reptile--Hawk. The worm--Hawk. The varlet--Hawk.    I crammed my hat on and hurried out of the house toward the village.          A CHANCE MEETING    XVI      I roamed the place in search of the varlet for the space of half an  hour, and, after having drawn all his familiar haunts, found him at  length leaning over the sea wall near the church, gazing thoughtfully  into the waters below.    I confronted him.    \"Well,\" I said, \"you're a beauty, aren't you?\"    He eyed me owlishly. Even at this early hour, I was grieved to see, he  showed signs of having looked on the bitter while it was brown.    \"Beauty?\" he echoed.    \"What have you got to say for yourself?\"    It was plain that he was engaged in pulling his faculties together by  some laborious process known only to himself. At present my words  conveyed no meaning to him. He was trying to identify me. He had seen  me before somewhere, he was certain, but he could not say where, or  who I was.    \"I want to know,\" I said, \"what induced you to be such an abject idiot  as to let our arrangement get known?\"    I spoke quietly. I was not going to waste the choicer flowers of  speech on a man who was incapable of understanding them. Later on,  when he had awakened to a sense of his position, I would begin really  to talk to him.    He continued to stare at me. Then a sudden flash of intelligence lit  up his features.    \"Mr. Garnick,\" he said.    \"You've got it at last.\"    He stretched out a huge hand.    \"I want to know,\" I said distinctly, \"what you've got to say for  yourself after letting our affair with the professor become public  property?\"    He paused a while in thought.    \"Dear sir,\" he said at last, as if he were dictating a letter, \"dear  sir, I owe you--ex--exp--\"    \"You do,\" said I grimly. \"I should like to hear it.\"    \"Dear sir, listen me.\"    \"Go on, then.\"    \"You came me. You said, 'Hawk, Hawk, ol' fren', listen me. You tip  this ol' bufflehead into sea,' you said, 'an' gormed if I don't give  'ee a gould savrin.' That's what you said me. Isn't that what you said  me?\"    I did not deny it.    \"Ve' well. I said you, 'Right,' I said. I tipped the ol' soul into  sea, and I got the gould savrin.\"    \"Yes, you took care of that. All this is quite true, but it's beside  the point. We are not disputing about what happened. What I want to  know for the third time--is what made you let the cat out of the bag?  Why couldn't you keep quiet about it?\"    He waved his hand.    \"Dear sir,\" he replied. \"This way. Listen me.\"    It was a tragic story that he unfolded. My wrath ebbed as I listened.  After all, the fellow was not so greatly to blame. I felt that in his  place I should have acted as he had done. Fate was culpable, and fate  alone.    It appeared that he had not come well out of the matter of the  accident. I had not looked at it hitherto from his point of view.  While the rescue had left me the popular hero, it had had quite the  opposite result for him. He had upset his boat and would have drowned  his passenger, said public opinion, if the young hero from  London--myself--had not plunged in, and at the risk of his life  brought the professor to shore. Consequently, he was despised by all  as an inefficient boatman. He became a laughing stock. The local wags  made laborious jests when he passed. They offered him fabulous sums to  take their worst enemies out for a row with him. They wanted to know  when he was going to school to learn his business. In fact, they  behaved as wags do and always have done at all times all the world  over.    Now, all this Mr. Hawk, it seemed, would have borne cheerfully and  patiently for my sake, or, at any rate, for the sake of the good  golden sovereign I had given him. But a fresh factor appeared in the  problem, complicating it grievously. To wit, Miss Jane Muspratt.    \"She said me,\" explained Mr. Hawk with pathos, \"'Harry 'Awk,' she  said, 'yeou'm a girt fule, an' I don't marry noone as is ain't to be  trusted in a boat by hisself, and what has jokes made about him by  that Tom Leigh.' I punched Tom Leigh,\" observed Mr. Hawk  parenthetically. \"'So,' she said me, 'yeou can go away, an' I don't  want to see yeou again.'\"    This heartless conduct on the part of Miss Muspratt had had the  natural result of making him confess all in self-defense, and she had  written to the professor the same night.    I forgave Mr. Hawk. I think he was hardly sober enough to understand,  for he betrayed no emotion.    \"It is fate, Hawk,\" I said, \"simply fate. There is a divinity that  shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will, and it's no good  grumbling.\"    \"Yiss,\" said Mr. Hawk, after chewing this sentiment for a while in  silence, \""]]]
