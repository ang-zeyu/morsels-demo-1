There is no evidence, however, that it was used as a  mariner's compass until centuries afterwards.    But the matter connected with light, as an electrical development, which  interests us, is its manifestations to the ancients in the form of  lightning. The electricity of the earth concentrates itself on the tops  of mountains, or in sharp peaks, and accounts for the magnificent  electrical displays always found in mountainous regions.    Some years ago, a noted scientist, Dr. Siemens, while standing on the  top of the great pyramid of Cheops, in Egypt, during a storm, noted that  an electrical discharge flowed from his hand when extended toward the  heavens. The current manifested itself in such a manner that the hissing  noise was plainly perceptible.    The literature of all ages and of all countries shows that this  manifestation of electrical discharges was noted, and became the subject  of discussions among learned men.    All these displays were regarded as the bolts of an angry God, and  historians give many accounts of instances where, in His anger, He sent  down the lightning to destroy.    Among the Romans Jupiter thus hurled forth his wrath; and among many  ancient people, even down to the time of Charlemagne, any space struck  by lightning was considered sacred, and made consecrated ground.    From this grew the belief that it was sacrilegious to attempt to imitate  the lightning of the sky--that Deity would visit dire punishment on any  man who attempted to produce an electric light. Virgil relates accounts  where certain princes attempted to imitate the lightning, and were  struck by thunderbolts as punishments.    Less than a century ago Benjamin Franklin devised the lightning rod, in  order to prevent lightning from striking objects. The literature of that  day abounds with instances of protests made, on the part of those who  were as superstitions as the people in ancient times, who urged that it  was impious to attempt to ward off Heaven's lightnings. It was argued  that the lightning was one way in which the Creator manifested His  displeasure, and exercised His power to strike the wicked.    When such writers as Pliny will gravely set forth an explanation of the  causes of lightning, as follows in the paragraph below, we can  understand why it inculcated superstitious fears in the people of  ancient times. He says:    \"Most men are ignorant of that secret, which, by close observation of  the heavens, deep scholars and principal men of learning have found  out, namely, that they are the fires of the uppermost planets, which,  falling to the earth, are called lightning; but those especially which  are seated in the middle, that is about Jupiter, perhaps because  participating in the excessive cold and moisture from the upper circle  of Saturn, and the immoderate heat of Mars, that is next beneath, by  this means he discharges his superfluity, and therefore it is commonly  said, 'That Jupiter shooteth and darteth lightning.' Therefore, like as  out of a burning piece of wood a coal flieth forth with a crack, even so  from a star is spit out, as it were, and voided forth this celestial  fire, carrying with it presages of future things; so that the heavens  showeth divine operations, even in these parcels and portions which are  rejected and cast away as superfluous.\"          CHAPTER XVII    POWER, AND VARIOUS OTHER ELECTRICAL MANIFESTATIONS      It would be difficult to mention any direction in human activity where  electricity does not serve as an agent in some form or manner. Man has  learned that the Creator gave this great power into the hands of man to  use, and not to curse.    When the dynamo was first developed it did not appear possible that it  could generate electricity, and then use that electricity in order to  turn the dynamo in the opposite direction. It all seems so very natural  to us now, that such a thing should practically follow; but man had to  learn this.    Let us try to make the statement plain by a few simple illustrations. By  carefully going over the chapter on the making of the dynamo, it will be  evident that the basis of the generation of the current depends on the  changing of the direction of the flow of an electric current.    Look at the simple horse-shoe magnet. If two of them are gradually moved  toward each other, so that the north pole of one approaches the north  pole of the other, there is a sensible attempt for them to push away  from each other. If, however, one of them is turned, so that the north  pole of one is opposite the south pole of the other, they will draw  together.    In this we have the foundation physical action of the dynamo and the  motor. When power is applied to an armature, and it moves through a  magnetic field, the action is just the same as in the case of the hand  drawing the north and the south pole of the two approaching magnets from  each other.    The influence of the electrical disturbance produced by that act  permeated the entire winding of the field and armature, and extended out  on the whole line with which the dynamo was connected. In this way a  current was established and transmitted, and with proper wires was sent  in the form of circuits and distributed so as to do work.    But an electric current, without suitable mechanism, is of no value. It  must have mechanism to use it, as well as to make it. In the case of  light, we have explained how the arc and the incandescent lamps utilize  it for that purpose.    But now, attempting to get something from it in the way of power, means  another piece of mechanism. This is done by the motor, and this motor is  simply a converter, or a device for reversing the action of the  electricity.    Attention is called to Figs. 120 and 121. Let us assume that the field  magnets A, A are the positives, and the magnets B, B the negatives. The  revolving armature has also four magnet coils, two of them, C, C, being  positive, and the other two, D, D, negative, each of these magnet coils  being so connected up that they will reverse the polarities of the  magnets.    [Illustration: _Figs. 120-121._ ACTION OF MAGNETS IN A DYNAMO]    Now in the particular position of the revolving armature, in Fig. 120,  the magnets of the armature have just passed the respective poles of the  field magnets, and the belt E is compelled to turn the armature past the  pole pieces by force in the direction of the arrow F. After the armature  magnets have gone to the positions in Fig. 121, the positives A try to  draw back the negatives D of the armature, and at the same time the  negatives B repel the negatives D, because they are of the same  polarities.    This repulsion of the negatives A, B continues until the armature poles  C, D have slightly passed them, when the polarities of the magnets C, D  are changed; so that it will be seen, by reference to Fig. 122, that D  is now retreating from B, and C is going away from A--that is, being  forced away contrary to their natural attractive influences, and in Fig.  123, when the complete cycle is nearly finished, the positives are again  approaching each other and the negatives moving together.    [Illustration: _Figs. 122-123._ CYCLE ACTION IN DYNAMO]    In this manner, at every point, the sets of magnets are compelled to  move against their magnetic pull. This explains the dynamo.    Now take up the cycle of the motor, and note in Fig. 124 that the  negative magnets D of the armature are closely approaching the positive  and negative magnets, on one side; and the positive magnets C are  nearing the positive and negatives on the other side. The positives A,  therefore, attract the negatives D, and the negative B exert a pull on  the positives C at the same time. The result is that the armature is  caused to revolve, as shown by the dart G, in a direction opposite to  the dart in Fig. 120.    [Illustration: _Figs. 124-125._ ACTION OF MAGNETS IN MOTOR]    When the pole pieces of the magnets C, D are about to pass magnets A, B,  as shown in Fig. 125, it is necessary to change the polarities of the  armature magnets C, D; so that by reference to Fig. 126, it will be seen  that they are now indicated as C-, and D+, respectively, and have moved  to a point midway between the poles A, B (as in Fig. 125), where the  pull on one side, and the push on the other are again the same, and the  last Figure 127 shows the cycle nearly completed.    The shaft of the motor armature is now the element which turns the  mechanism which is to be operated. To convert electrical impulses into  power, as thus shown, results in great loss. The first step is to take  the steam boiler, which is the first stage in that source which is the  most common and universal, and by means of fuel, converting water into  steam. The second is to use the pressure of this steam to drive an  engine; the third is to drive the dynamo which generates the electrical  impulse; and the fourth is the conversion from the dynamo into a motor  shaft. Loss is met with at each step, and the great problem is to  eliminate this waste.    [Illustration: _Figs. 126-127._ POSITIONS OF MAGNETS IN MOTOR]    The great advantage of electrical power is not in utilizing it for  consumption at close ranges, but where it is desired to transmit it for  long distances. Such illustrations may be found in electric railways,  and where water power can be obtained as the primal source of energy,  the cost is not excessive. It is found, however, that even with the most  improved forms of mechanism, in electrical construction, the internal  combustion engines are far more economical.      _Transmission of Energy_    One of the great problems has been the transmission of the current to  great distances. By"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22771"],[0,"Cattle and Their Diseases (#19)"],[1," his land in grass, improving its quality and  productiveness by means of top-dressing, and putting money in his  pocket--which is, after all, the true test both for theory and practice.    Another practical case on this point is that of a gentleman in the same  State who had four cows, but not a rod of land on which to pasture them.  They were, therefore, never out of the barn--or, at least, not out of  the yard--and were fed with grass, regularly mown for them; with green  Indian corn and fodder, which had been sown broadcast for the purpose;  and with about three pints of meal a day. Their produce in butter was  kept for thirteen weeks. Two of them were but two years old, having  calved the same spring. All the milk of one of them was taken by her  calf for six weeks out of the thirteen, and some of the milk of the  other was taken for family use, the quantity of which was not measured.  These heifers could not, therefore, be estimated as equal to more than  one cow in full milk. And yet from these cows no less than three hundred  and eighty-nine pounds of butter were made in the thirteen weeks.  Another pound would have made an average of thirty pounds a week for the  whole time.    It appears from these and other similar instances of soiling, or  stall-feeding in summer on green crops cut for the purpose, that the  largely increased quantity of the yield fully compensates for the  slightly deteriorated quality. And not only is the quantity yielded by  each cow increased, but the same extent of land, under the same culture,  will carry double or treble the number of ordinary pastures, and keep  them in better condition. There is also a saving of manure. But with us  the economy of soiling is the exception, and not the rule.    In adopting this system of feeding, regularity is required as much as in  any other, and a proper variety of food. A succession of green crops  should be provided, as near as convenient to the stable. The first will  naturally be winter rye, in the Northern States, as that shoots up with  great luxuriance. Winter rape would probably be an exceedingly valuable  addition to the plants usually cultivated for soiling in this country,  in sections where it would withstand the severity of the winter.  Cabbages, kept in the cellar or pit, and transplanted early, will also  come in here to advantage, and clover will very soon follow them; oats,  millet, and green Indian-corn, as the season advances; and, a little  later still, perhaps, the Chinese sugar-cane, which should not be cut  till headed out. These plants, in addition to other cultivated grasses,  will furnish an unfailing succession of succulent and tender fodder;  while the addition of a little Indian, linseed, or cotton-seed meal will  be found economical.    In the vicinity of large towns and cities, where the object is too often  to feed for the largest quantity, without reference to quality, an  article known as distillers' swill, or still-slop, is extensively used.  This, if properly fed in limited quantities, in combination with other  and more bulky food, may be a valuable article for the dairyman; but, if  given--as it too often is--without the addition of other kinds of food,  it soon affects the health and constitution of the animals fed on it.  This swill contains a considerable quantity of water, some nitrogenous  compounds, and some inorganic matter in the shape of phosphates and  alkaline salts found in the different kinds of grain of which it is made  up, as Indian corn, wheat, barley, rye, and the like. Where this forms  the principal food of milch cows, the milk is of a very poor  quality--blue in color, and requiring the addition of coloring  substances to make it saleable. It contains, often, less than one per  cent. of butter, and seldom over one and three-tenths or one and a half  per cent.--while good, saleable milk should contain from three to five  per cent. It will not coagulate, it is said, in less than five or six  hours; while good milk will invariably coagulate in an hour or less,  under the same conditions. Its effect on the system of young children  is, therefore, very destructive, causing diseases of various kinds, and,  if continued, death.    So pernicious have been the consequences resulting from the use of this  \"swill-milk,\" as it is called, in the largest city of this country, that  the Legislature of the State of New York, at a recent session (1861-2),  interfered in behalf of the community by making the sale of the article  a penal offence.      CULTURE OF GRASSES FOR FODDER.    As has been already stated, the grasses in summer, and hay in winter,  form the most natural and important food for milch cows; and, whatever  other crops come in as additional, these will form the basis of all  systems of feeding.    The nutritive qualities of the grasses differ widely; and their value as  feed for cows will depend, to a considerable extent, on the management  of pastures and mowing-lands. Some considerations bearing upon the  subject of the proper cultivation of these leading articles of food  are, therefore, proposed in this article.    [Illustration: PATIENTLY WAITING.]    If the turf of an old pasture is carefully examined, it will be found to  contain a large variety of plants and grasses adapted for forage; some  of them valuable for one purpose, and some for another. Some of them,  though possessing a lower percentage of nutritive constituents than  others, are particularly esteemed for an early and luxuriant growth,  furnishing sweet feed in early spring, before other grasses appear; some  of them, for starting more rapidly than others, after having been eaten  off by cattle, and, consequently, of great value as pasture grasses.  Most grasses will be found to be of a social character, and do best in a  large mixture with other varieties.    In forming a mixture for pasture grasses, the peculiar qualities of each  species should, therefore, be regarded: as the time of flowering, the  habits of growth, the soil and location on which it grows best, and  other characteristics.    Among the grasses found on cultivated lands in this country, the  following are considered as among the most valuable for ordinary farm  cultivation; some of them being adapted to pastures, and others almost  exclusively to mowing and the hay-crop: Timothy, Meadow Foxtail, June or  Kentucky Blue Grass, Fowl Meadow, Rough-stalked Meadow, Orchard Grass,  Perennial Rye Grass, Italian Rye Grass, Redtop, English Bent, Meadow  Fescue, Tall Oat Grass, Sweet-scented Vernal, Hungarian Grass, Red  Clover, White or Dutch Clover, and some others.    Of these, the most valuable, all things considered, is TIMOTHY. It forms  a large proportion of what is commonly called English, or in some  sections meadow, hay, though it originated and was first cultivated in  this country. It contains a large percentage of nutritive matter, in  comparison with other agricultural grasses. It thrives best on moist,  peaty, or loamy soils, of medium tenacity, and is not well suited to  very light, sandy lands. On very moist soils, its root is almost always  fibrous; while on dry and loamy ones it is bulbous. On soils of the  former description, which it especially affects, its growth is rapid,  and its yield of hay large, sometimes amounting to three or four tons  the acre, depending much, of course, upon cultivation. But, though very  valuable for hay, it is not adapted for pasture, as it will neither  endure severe grazing, nor is its aftermath to be compared with that of  meadow foxtail, and some of the other grasses.    JUNE GRASS, better known in some sections as Kentucky Blue Grass, is  very common in most sections of the country, especially on limestone  lands, forming a large part of the turf, wherever it flourishes, and  being held in universal esteem as a pasture grass. It starts early, but  varies much in size and appearance, according to the soil; growing in  some places with the utmost luxuriance, and forming the predominant  grass; in others, yielding to the other species. If cut at the time of  flowering, or a few days after, it makes a good and nutritious hay,  though it is surpassed in nutritive qualities by several of the other  grasses. It starts slowly after having been cut, especially if not cut  very early. But its herbage is fine and uniform, and admirably adapted  to lawns, growing well in almost all soils, though it does not endure  very severe droughts. It withstands, however, the frosts of winter  better than most other grasses.    In Kentucky--a section where it attains its highest perfection and  luxuriance, ripening its seeds about the tenth of June--and in latitudes  south of that, it sometimes continues green through the mild winters. It  requires three or four years to become well set, after sowing, and it  does not attain its highest yield as a pasture grass till the sod is  even older than that. It is not, therefore, suited to alternate  husbandry, where land usually remains in grass but two or three years  before being ploughed up. In Kentucky, it is sown any time in winter  when the sun is on the ground, three or four quarts of seed being used  to the acre. In spring the seeds germinate, when the sprouts are  exceedingly fine and delicate. Stock is not allowed on it the first  year.    The MEADOW FOXTAIL is also an excellent pasture grass It somewhat  resembles Timothy, but is earlier, has a softer spike, and thrives on  all soils except the dryest. Its growth is rapid, and it is greatly  relished by stock of all kinds. Its stalks and leaves are too few and  light for a field crop, and it shrinks too much in curing to be valuable  for hay. It flourishes best in a rich, moist, and rather strong soil,  sending up a luxuriant aftermath when cut or grazed off, which is much  more valuable, both in quality and nutritive value, than the first crop.  In all lands designed for permanent pasture, therefore, it should form a "]]]
