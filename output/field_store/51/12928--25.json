[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24072"],[0,"First Italian Readings (#19)"],[1," una voce in  cui si sentiva un'improvvisa contentezza.    --Mi perdona?--le domandavo.    --Oh buon figliuolo!--rispondeva;--perdoni lei a me, che sono una  brontolona e una zotica. Ma veda: glielo dico per il su' bene che non  venga a casa tardi perchè... io non ho mica il diritto di impicciarmi  nella sua condotta... si capisce... ma ho notato che tutte le sere che  viene a casa tardi, e non studia più, la mattina dopo è di malumore.    --Ha ragione, padrona, ha ragione! Apra la porta, e facciamo pace.    Essa apriva la porta e non faceva mai in tempo a levarsi il fazzoletto  dagli occhi.    Così passarono sei mesi.    Un giorno, dopo una settimana intera di preparativi e di esitazioni, mi  feci forza e le dissi, guardandola fisso negli occhi:    --Padrona, io debbo partire da Firenze.    --Dove va?    --A casa mia.    --Va bene. Io terrò le sue camere libere per quando tornerà. Può lasciar  qui libri, quadri, carte, come le lascerebbe alla sua famiglia. Prima  che ritorni farò mettere la stufa, compererò un altro seggiolone e se mi  salta il ticchio farò cambiare la tappezzeria al salotto. E passeremo il  nostro invernetto insieme d'amore e d'accordo, lei a studiare ed io a  fare le mie faccenduole. Ah! vedo che almeno negli ultimi anni della mia  vita avrò qualche consolazione. Quando tornerà?    --Cara padrona... non glielo posso dire.    --Che forse non tornerebbe più?--domandò col viso alterato.    --Forse non tornerò più!    Stette qualche momento senza parlare e poi esclamò con voce  tremante:--Ma dunque io resterò sola!...    E tacque di nuovo come per sentir l'eco di quella triste parola.    Poi nascose il viso nel grembiale e diede in uno scoppio di pianto.    M'aiutò a fare i miei bauli, volle riporre tutti i libri colle sue mani,  non mi lasciò più un momento fino all'ora della partenza. L'ultima  notte, verso le undici, mentre scrivevo, picchiò ancora una volta nella  parete e mi pregò di avermi riguardo agli occhi. La mattina seguente,  quando partii, mi accompagnò fin sul pianerottolo e mi disse colla  solita dolcezza:--Lei se ne torna colla sua famiglia; io, povera  vecchia, rimango sola. Si ricordi qualche volta di me che le volevo bene  come a un figliuolo. Abbia giudizio; continui a studiare e sarà  contento. Mentre viaggerà in Spagna e in Francia, io guarderò il suo  ritratto, leggerò i suoi libri e pregherò il Signore per lei. Quando  morirò, lei si ricorderà che le ho voluto bene e piangerà, non è vero?  Ed ora vada, figliuolo, che è tardi; e Dio l'accompagni!    Le diedi un bacio e discesi per le scale. La povera donna mi mandò  ancora un addio rotto da un singhiozzo e poi rientrò nella sua casa  vuota e triste.    Oh buona e cara vecchia! se mi son ricordato di te! In viaggio, ogni  volta che ho passata la notte a scrivere in una camera d'albergo, allo  scoccare delle undici ho detto tra me, con tristezza:--Oh! se sentissi  picchiare nel muro, quanto lavorerei più volentieri!--Ogni volta che  scrivo, e rileggendo la mia prosa, la trovo scolorita e senza grazia,  dico con rammarico:--Ah! quanto ci corre da[XV.8] quest'italiano a  quello della mia padrona di casa!--La sera, quando la mia famiglia è  raccolta intorno al fuoco, e tutti ridono e lavorano, io penso col cuore  stretto che tu sei sola nella tua stanza, forse al freddo e al buio,  perchè la legna e l'olio sono rincarati. E non mi si presenta mai  l'immagine della mia cara Firenze, senza ch'io goda in fondo all'anima  pensando che un giorno forse vi tornerò, che andrò a cercarti, che ti  troverò ancora, che mi rimetterò a imparare da te la lingua armoniosa e  gentile con cui mi rallegravi e mi davi coraggio.

This is done by taking a number of card slivers and  forming a lap of them by passing the sliver through a sliver lap  machine. The laps are passed through the comber. This machine consists  essentially of a series of rollers, nippers, and rows of metal teeth.  By the action of these, the short fibers are separated and combed out,  and the long ones arranged in parallel order in the form of a thin,  silky strand, in which condition it is sent to the drawing frames to  be drawn out. Of course it must be understood that a combing machine  is used by only a small percentage of cotton spinners. For ordinary  purposes a sufficiently good quality can be made without a comber. As  there is from 15 to 35 per cent waste to this operation it may be  readily seen that it is costly, and limited entirely to the production  of the very best and finest yarns, such as those intended for sewing  or machine thread, fine hosiery, lace curtains, underwear, imitation  silks, and fine grades of white goods. There are combing machines that  comb short staple cotton.    =Drawing.= The cans containing the slivers are taken from the card or  combing machine (as the case may be) to the drawing frame. The object  of this machine is mainly to equalize the slivers, combining a number  of them together so as to distribute the fibers uniformly. The  condition of the fibers on leaving the card or comb is such that a  slight pull will lay them perfectly straight or parallel, and this  pull is given by the drawing frame rollers. Of course the fibers  coming from the comb are parallel, but it is necessary to alternate  them by the drawing. The drawing frame is a machine consisting of a  number of sets of rollers, the front roller having a greater speed  than the rear ones.    [Illustration: COTTON COMB ROOM      1. The cotton in the form of a \"lap\" ready to pass through the comb.]    The slivers, which are as nearly as possible the same weight per  yard, are combined together in the drawing and emerge from the pair of  front rollers as one sliver weighing the same number of grains per  yard as a single sliver fed up at the back. This process is repeated  two or three times, according to requirements, the material then being  referred to as having passed through so many \"heads\" of drawing. It is  not unusual to pass Indian and American cotton through three  deliveries.    The object of all the processes thus far described has been that of  cleaning (in the picker), arranging the fibers in a parallel position  to each other, making uniform, and drawing out the stock. In every  case the stock delivered from a machine is lighter than when fed into  it, and contains just twist enough to hold it together and prevent its  being stretched or strained when unwound from the bobbin, and fed into  the next machine. The minimum amount of twist in roving is desirable  for the reason that it permits the stock to be drawn out more easily  and uniformly, the little twist that is put in the roving by the  slubber being practically eliminated when it is passed through the  rolls of the intermediate. The same applies in the case of the roving  passing from the roving to the spinning frame.    =Fly Frames.= The process in the manufacture of yarn after the cotton  has passed through the drawing frame consists of further attenuation  of the sliver, but as the cotton sliver has been drawn out as much as  is possible without breakage, a small amount of \"twist\" is introduced  to allow of the continued drawing out of the sliver.    From the drawing frame, the drawing passes through two, three, or four  fly frames, according to the number of yarn to be made. All these  machines are identical in principle and construction, and differ only  in the size of some of the working parts. They are the slubber,  intermediate, roving,--and fine or jack frame-fine, and the function  of each is to draw and twist.    [Illustration: ROVING DEPARTMENT      1. Slubber machine, showing sliver of cotton passing through the       rolls and then given a twist while it is wound on the bobbin.]    =Intermediate Frame.= The function of the intermediate frame is to  receive the slightly twisted rove from the slubber and add thereto a  little more twist and draft. The rove is taken from two bobbins to  one spindle in the machine, an arrangement which tends to insure  strength and uniformity. The principle of the machine is in other  respects the same as that of the slubbing frame.    =Roving Frame.= The function of the roving frame is to receive the  twisted rove from the intermediate and add more twist and draft,  thereby further attenuating the rove. As in the intermediate frame the  rove is generally taken from two bobbins for one spindle.    =Fine or Jack Frame.= This machine is used when fine yarns have to be  made. It is built on the same principle as the preceding frames, the  only difference being that a finer rove is made from which finer  numbers of yarn can be spun. As in the slubber, intermediate, and  roving frames, the rove is taken from two bobbins for one spindle.    =Spinning.= In the manufacture of single ply yarn the final process is  that of spinning, which consists in drawing out the cotton roving to  the required size, and giving it the proper amount of twist necessary  to make the yarn of the required strength. While the spinning frame is  built on entirely different principles from the roving, intermediate,  or slubber frame, the object of each machine is the same as that of  the spinning frame. The principal point of difference is the amount of  twist imparted to the cotton roving.    [Illustration: ROVING ROOM      1. A drawing frame showing the sliver of cotton passing through the       machine.    2. A slubber showing the sliver passing through and wound on bobbins.    3. Roving machine showing the cotton passing from one bobbin through       the roller to another.]    The objects of the spinning process are:    1. Completion of the drawing out of the cotton roving to the required  size.    2. Insertion of the proper amount of twist to give the thread  produced strength.    Excessive speed causes defects in the yarn and undue wear and tear on  the machine.    There are two methods of spinning: ring spinning and mule spinning.  The mule spinning is the older form. There are but few mule frames in  operation in this country.    =Mule Spinning.= The function of mule spinning is to spin on the bare  spindle, or upon the short paper tubes, when such are required to form  a base for the cop bottom. The mule will spin any counts of yarn  required, and is especially adapted for yarn in which elasticity and  \"cover\" are essentials. Hosiery yarns are produced on the ordinary  cotton mule and are very soft spun.    The bobbins of roving are placed in a creel at the back of the  machine, the stands of roving being passed through the rolls and drawn  out in the same manner as at the roving frame. The spindles are  mounted on a carriage which moves backward and forward in its relation  to the rolls, the distance roved being about five feet. When the  spindles are moving away from the frame the stock is being delivered  by the rolls, the speed at which the spindles move away from the rolls  being just enough to keep the ends at a slight tension. The twist is  put in the yarn at the same time.    [Illustration: SPINNING ROOM. COTTON DEPARTMENT      1. Humidifier--an apparatus to give off moisture.    2. Spinning frames--showing the cotton as it comes from the roving       frame and passes through the spinning frame.]    When the spindles reach their greatest distance from the rolls, the  latter are automatically stopped and the direction of the motion of  the spindle carriage reversed. The yarn is wound on the spindle while  the carriage is being moved back toward the rolls, the motion of the  rolls being stopped in the meanwhile, the spindles revolving only fast  enough to wind up the thread that has been spun during the outward  move of the carriage.    The mule is a much more complicated machine than the ring frame, its  floor space is much greater, and more skilled help is required for its  operation. Under ordinary conditions it is not practical to spin finer  yarn than No. 60s on a ring, while as high as No. 500s is said to have  been spun on a mule. The same number of yarn can be spun on a mule  with less twist than on the ring. This is important in hosiery yarn.    Ring spinning is used for coarse numbers, and has greater production  and requires less labor than mule spinning. Ring-spinning yarn is used  for warp purposes.    =Ring Spinning.= The function of ring spinning is to draw out the rove  and spin it into yarn on a continuous system. The yarn made is spun  upon bobbins.    The ring spinning differs from mule spinning in having the carriage  replaced by a ring, from which the machine takes its name. The ring is  from one and one-half to three inches in diameter, grooved inside and  out, and is connected with a flat steel wire shaped like the letter D,  called the \"traveller.\" Its office is to constitute a drag upon the  yarn, by means of which the latter is wound upon a bobbin. Its size  and weight depend on the counts of yarns to be spun; coarse yarns  demand the largest ring and heaviest traveller.    [Illustration: MULE ROOM      1.
