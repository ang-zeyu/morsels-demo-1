I baptise the Margarat.'[275] The  Swedish witches (1669) were also baptized; 'they added, that he caused them  to be baptized too by such Priests as he had there, and made them confirm  their Baptism with dreadful Oaths and Imprecations.'[276] Curiously enough  the most detailed account comes from New England (1692). Mary Osgood, wife  of Captain Osgood, went 'to five mile pond, where she was baptized by the  devil, who dipped her face in the water, and made her renounce her former  baptism, and told her she must be his, soul and body for ever, and that she  must serve him, which she promised to do. She says, the renouncing her  first baptism was after her dipping.'[277] The account of Goody Lacey's  experience is given in the form of question and answer:         '_Q._ Goody Lacey! how many years since they were baptized? _A._ Three       or four years ago, I suppose. _Q._ Who baptized them? _A._ The old       serpent. _Q._ How did he do it? _A._ He dipped their heads in the       water, saying, that they were his and that he had power over them.       _Q._ Where was this? _A._ At Fall's River. _Q._ How many were baptized       that day? _A._ Some of the chief; I think they were six baptized. _Q._       Name them. _A._ I think they were of the higher powers.'[278]    A near approach to the ceremony of baptism is the blood-rite at Auldearne,  described by Isobel Gowdie and Janet Breadheid. The Devil marked Isobel on  the shoulder, 'and suked owt my blood at that mark, and spowted it in his  hand, and, sprinkling it on my head, said, \"I baptise the, Janet, in my  awin name.\"' The Devil marked Janet Breadheid in the same way on the  shoulder, 'and suked out my blood with his mowth, at that place; he  spowted it in his hand, and sprinkled it on my head. He baptised me  thairvith in his awin nam, \"Christian.\"'[279]    Though baptism is rare, the giving of a new name on admission is peculiar  to Scotland. The names seem to have been usually nicknames derived from  various sources; personal peculiarities such as 'Weill dancing Janet', or  'Able and stout'; contractions of the proper name, as 'Naip' for Barbara  Napier; or a title such as 'Rob the Rowar', for Robert Grierson, who kept  the rows or rolls. Most of the other names appear to have been ordinary  Christian names arbitrarily bestowed. There is nothing to throw any light  on the reason for the change. In 1590 at North Berwick the witch-name was  considered of the highest importance.         'Robert Griersoune being namit, thay ran all hirdie-girdie and wer       angrie; for it wes promesit, that he sould be callit \"Ro^t the       Comptroller alias Rob the Rowar\" for expreming of his name.--Effie       McCalzane, Robert Griersoune, and the said Barbara, hapnit to be       nameit thair; quhilk offendit all the cumpany: And that they sould       nocht haif bene nameit with thair awin names; Robert Griersoun, to       haif bene callit _Rob the rowar_; Effie to be callit _Cane_; and the       said Barbara, to be callit _Naip_.'[280]    Later, the change of name was of so little value that at Crook of Devon  several of the witches could not remember what they had been called; Bessie  Henderson appears to have recollected the name after a time, for it is  inserted towards the end of the confession; Robert Wilson could remember  the Devil's name but not his own: Agnes Brugh and Christian Grieve could  remember neither the Devil's nor their own.[281]    The so-called 'christening', i.e. naming, of animals, comes rather under  the head of 'sacrifice' than of baptism, for the ceremony appears to have  been purificatory.      6. _The Mark_    The Witches' Mark, or Devil's Mark, as it is indifferently called, is one  of the most important points in the identification of a witch, as the  infliction of it was often the final rite in the admission ceremonies. The  fact that any person bore such a mark was taken as incontrovertible proof  that the bearer was a witch.    There were two kinds of marks, which should be carefully differentiated,  one of which was clearly natural, the other probably artificial. Both were  said to be insensible to pain and not to bleed when pricked or pierced.  Local anaesthesia is vouched for in much of the evidence, which suggests  that there is a substratum of truth in the statements, but I can at present  offer no solution of this problem.    The writers on witchcraft, particularly the legal authorities, recognize  the value of the Mark as proof of witchcraft, and some differentiate  between the two forms; the witches themselves made a distinction between  the two, the natural being considered inferior to the artificial.    Reginald Scot in 1584 summarizes the evidence in a few words: 'The Diuell  giveth to euerie nouice a marke, either with his teeth or with his  clawes.'[282] The _Lawes against Witches and Conivration_, published 'by  authority' in 1645, state that 'their said Familiar hath some big or little  Teat upon their body, wher he sucketh them: and besides their sucking, the  Devil leaveth other markes upon their bodies, sometimes like a Blew-spot,  or Red-spot like a flea-biting'. Sir George Mackenzie, the famous Scotch  lawyer, describing in 1699 what did and did not legally constitute a witch,  says:         'The Devils Mark useth to be a great Article with us, but it is not       _per se_ found relevant, except it be confest by them, that they got       that Mark with their own consent; _quo casu_, it is equivalent to a       Paction. This Mark is given to them, as is alledg'd, by a Nip in any       part of the Body, and it is blew. Delrio calls it _Stigma_, or       Character, and alledges that it is sometimes like the impression of a       Hare's foot, or the Foot of a Rat or Spider.'[283]    Forbes, writing in 1730, says:         'On the meaner Proselytes the Devil fixes in some secret Part of their       Bodies a Mark, as his Seal to know his own by; which is like a Flea       Bite or blew Spot, or sometimes resembles a little Teat, and the Part       so stamped doth ever after remain insensible, and doth not bleed, tho'       never so much nipped or pricked by thrusting a Pin, Awl or Bodkin into       it; but if the Covenanter be of better Rank, the Devil only draws       Blood of the Party, or touches him or her in some Part of the Body       without any visible Mark remaining.'[284]    The Mark proper appears to have been the coloured spot or design which  followed the infliction of a prick or nip by the claws or teeth of the  Devil on the person of the neophyte. The red mark is described as being  like a flea-bite, i.e. small and circular; the blue mark seems to have been  larger and more elaborate, apparently in some kind of design. From the  evidence five facts are clear: (1) that the mark was coloured, (2) that it  was permanent, (3) that it was caused by the pricking or tearing of the  skin, (4) that the operator passed his hand or fingers over the place, (5)  that the pain could be severe and might last a considerable time. Put  together in this way, the facts suggest tattooing.    Among the Aberdeen witches in 1597 Andro Man was accused that 'Christsunday  [the Devil] bit a mark in the third finger of thy right hand, whilk thou  has yet to show'; and Christen Mitchell also was accused that 'the Devil  gave thee a nip on the back of thy right hand, for a mark that thou was one  of his number'.[285] According to Boguet, writing in 1598, the witches of  Eastern France were usually marked on the left shoulder, and the mark was  in the shape of the foot or footprint of a hare, but he also gives some  exceptional cases:         'L'epaule gauche est l'endroit, ou plus ordinairement il marque les       Sorciers. La marque des Sorciers est tantost come vne piste ou pied de       lieure, & tantost d'autre facon. On en a veu vne, qui auoit vne figure       rapportant en grandeur a vn petit denier, du centre de laquelle       s'estendoient plusieurs filamens vers la circonference. La marque de       la Belcuenotte, qui a este brulee a Besancon, estoit au dessus de sa       nature, vn peu plus bas que le nombril. Celle, dont Guillauma Proby       d'Anchay se trouua marquee au col du coste droit, estoit de mesme de       la grandeur d'vn petit denier, tirant sur le brun. Iean de Vaux auoit       la siene au doz, & ressembloit a vn petit chien noir.'[286]    De Lancre in 1609 says that in the Basses-Pyrenees 'comme le Diable faict  sa marque, on sent vn peu de chaleur, qui penetre plus ou moins  profondement la chair, que plus ou moins il pince le lieu qu'il touche'. As  regards the position of the mark he says:         'Il les egratigne tous auec le bras gauche, & les ongles de la main       senestre. Et tout aussi tost prenant vne espingle d'or faux, il les       marque le plus souuent dans le blac de l'[oe]il gauche, & leur imprime       vne marque qui semble vn petit crapaud' [elsewhere he says 'vne patte       de crapaud']; 'par fois dans l'epaule & coste gauche, ou dans la       cuisse, leur rompant & dechirant la peau & la chair iusques a effusio       de sang; si bien que pendant trois mois ils ont de tres grandes       douleurs.'[287]    Isobel Crawford of Irvine in 1618 had 'the devill's mark, quhilk was lyk  ane braid dyn spott, in the inner syd of hir left thie, about ane handbraid  under her lisk'.[288] The Lancashire witch, Margaret Johnson, in 1633,  'saith, that such Witches as have sharpe bones given them by the devill to  pricke them, have no papps nor duggs, but their devil receiveth blood from  the place, pricked with the bone, which witches are more grand witches than  any that have marks'.[289] The Yarmouth witch, tried in 1644, saw a tall  black man standing in the moonlight at her door: 'he told her, he must  first see her Hand; and then taking out something like a Pen-knife, he gave  it _a little Scratch_, so that Blood followed, and the _Mark_"]]]
