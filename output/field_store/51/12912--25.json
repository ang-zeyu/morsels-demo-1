It gave him confidence in himself, and when  Teddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.    But just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust,  and a tiny voice said: \"Be careful. I am Death!\" It was Karait, the  dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his  bite is as dangerous as the cobra's. But he is so small that nobody  thinks of him, and so he does the more harm to people.    Rikki-tikki's eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the  peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family.  It looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can  fly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this  is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more  dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn  so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to the back of the head,  he would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not  know. His eyes were all red, and he rocked back and forth, looking for  a good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and  tried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a  fraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head  followed his heels close.    Teddy shouted to the house: \"Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a  snake.\" And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy's mother. His father  ran out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out  once too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake's back,  dropped his head far between his forelegs, bitten as high up the back  as he could get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and  Rikki-tikki was just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom  of his family at dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a  slow mongoose, and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he  must keep himself thin.    He went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while  Teddy's father beat the dead Karait. \"What is the use of that?\" thought  Rikki-tikki. \"I have settled it all;\" and then Teddy's mother picked  him up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved Teddy  from death, and Teddy's father said that he was a providence, and Teddy  looked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the  fuss, which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy's mother might just  as well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was thoroughly  enjoying himself.    That night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the  table, he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things.  But he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be  patted and petted by Teddy's mother, and to sit on Teddy's shoulder, his  eyes would get red from time to time, and he would go off into his long  war cry of \"Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!\"    Teddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under  his chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon  as Teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house,  and in the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the musk-rat, creeping  around by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He  whimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up his mind to run  into the middle of the room. But he never gets there.    \"Don't kill me,\" said Chuchundra, almost weeping. \"Rikki-tikki, don't  kill me!\"    \"Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?\" said Rikki-tikki  scornfully.    \"Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,\" said Chuchundra, more  sorrowfully than ever. \"And how am I to be sure that Nag won't mistake  me for you some dark night?\"    \"There's not the least danger,\" said Rikki-tikki. \"But Nag is in the  garden, and I know you don't go there.\"    \"My cousin Chua, the rat, told me--\" said Chuchundra, and then he  stopped.    \"Told you what?\"    \"H'sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in  the garden.\"    \"I didn't--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I'll bite you!\"    Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers.  \"I am a very poor man,\" he sobbed. \"I never had spirit enough to run out  into the middle of the room. H'sh! I mustn't tell you anything. Can't  you hear, Rikki-tikki?\"    Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he  could just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as  faint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a  snake's scales on brick-work.    \"That's Nag or Nagaina,\" he said to himself, \"and he is crawling into  the bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to  Chua.\"    He stole off to Teddy's bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then  to Teddy's mother's bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall  there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as  Rikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he heard  Nag and Nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight.    \"When the house is emptied of people,\" said Nagaina to her husband, \"he  will have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in  quietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first  one to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki  together.\"    \"But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the  people?\" said Nag.    \"Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any  mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king  and queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the  melon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and  quiet.\"    \"I had not thought of that,\" said Nag. \"I will go, but there is no need  that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man  and his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the  bungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.\"    Rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then  Nag's head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body  followed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw  the size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head,  and looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his eyes  glitter.    \"Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on  the open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?\" said  Rikki-tikki-tavi.    Nag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the  biggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. \"That is good,\" said  the snake. \"Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may  have that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he  will not have a stick. I shall wait here till he comes. Nagaina--do you  hear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till daytime.\"    There was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone  away. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the  bottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an  hour he began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep,  and Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which would be the  best place for a good hold. \"If I don't break his back at the first  jump,\" said Rikki, \"he can still fight. And if he fights--O Rikki!\" He  looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too  much for him; and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.    \"It must be the head\"' he said at last; \"the head above the hood. And,  when I am once there, I must not let go.\"    Then he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar,  under the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back  against the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head. This  gave him just one second's purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he  was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the  floor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his eyes were red  and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the  tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and banged against the  tin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter,  for he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his  family, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy,  aching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a  thunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red  fire singed his fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had  fired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood.    Rikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was  dead. But the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said,  \"It's the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives  now.\"    Then Teddy's mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was  left of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy's bedroom and  spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out  whether he really was broken into forty pieces, as he fancied.    When morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings.  \"Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five  Nags, and there's no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch.  Goodness! I must go and see Darzee,\" he said.    Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where  Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice.

But there's nothing half so sweet in life    As love's young dream.--MOORE.                  All love is sweet,    Given or returned.

Let those love now who never loved before,    Let those that always loved now love the more.--PARNELL.    [Illustration: LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.]    1. LOVE BLENDS YOUNG HEARTS.--Love blends young hearts in blissful unity,  and, for the time, so ignores past ties and affections, as to make willing  separation of the son from his father's house, and the daughter from all  the sweet endearments of her childhood's home, to go out together, and rear  for themselves an altar, around which shall cluster all the cares and  delights, the anxieties and sympathies, of the family relationship; this  love, if pure, unselfish, and discreet, constitutes the chief usefulness  and happiness of human life.    2. WITHOUT LOVE.--Without love there would be no organized households, and,  consequently, none of that earnest endeavor for competence and  respectability, which is the mainspring to human effort; none of those  sweet, softening, restraining and elevating influences of domestic life,  which can alone fill the earth with the glory of the Lord and make glad the  city of Zion. This love is indeed heaven upon earth; but above would not be  heaven without it; where there is not love, there is fear; but, \"love  casteth out fear.\" And yet we naturally do offend what we most love.    3. LOVE IS THE SUN OF LIFE.--Most beautiful in morning and evening, but  warmest and steadiest at noon. It is the sun of the soul. Life without love  is worse than death; a world without a sun. The love which does not lead to  labor will soon die out, and the thankfulness which does not embody itself  in sacrifices is already changing to gratitude. Love is not ripened in one  day, nor in many, nor even in a human lifetime. It is the oneness of soul  with soul in appreciation and perfect trust. To be blessed it must rest in  that faith in the Divine which underlies every other motion. To be true, it  must be eternal as God himself.    4. LOVE IS DEPENDENT.--Remember that love is dependent upon forms; courtesy  of etiquette guards and protects courtesy of heart. How many hearts have  been lost irrevocably, and how many averted eyes and cold looks have been  gained from what seemed, perhaps, but a trifling negligence of forms?    {116}    [Illustration: LOVE MAKING IN THE EARLY COLONIAL DAYS.]    5. RADICAL DIFFERENCES.--Men and women should not be judged by the same  rules. There are many radical differences in their affectional natures. Man  is the creature of interest and ambition. His nature leads him forth into  the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but the embellishment of his  early life, or a song piped in the intervals of the acts. He seeks for  fame, for fortune, for space in the world's thoughts, and dominion over his  fellow-men. But a woman's whole life is a history of the affections. The  heart is her world; it is there her ambition strives for empire; it is  there her ambition seeks for hidden treasures. She sends forth her  sympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of  affection; and if shipwrecked her case is hopeless, for it is bankruptcy of  the heart.    6. WOMAN'S LOVE.--Woman's love is stronger than death; it rises superior to  adversity, and towers in sublime beauty above the niggardly selfishness of  the world. Misfortune cannot suppress it; enmity cannot alienate it;  temptation cannot enslave it. It is the guardian angel of the nursery and  the sick bed; it gives an affectionate concord to the partnership of life  and interest, circumstances cannot modify it; it ever remains the same to  sweeten existence, to purify the cup of life, on the rugged pathway to the  grave, and melt to moral pliability the brittle nature of man. It is the  ministering spirit of home, hovering in soothing caresses over the cradle,  and the death-bed of the household, and filling up the urn of all its  sacred memories.    7. A LADY'S COMPLEXION.--He who loves a lady's complexion, form and  features, loves not her true self, but her soul's old clothes. The love  that has nothing but beauty to sustain it, soon withers and dies. The love  that is fed with presents always requires feeding. Love, and love only, is  the loan for love. Love is of the nature of a burning glass, which, kept  still in one place, fireth; changed often, it doth nothing. The purest joy  we can experience in one we love, is to see that person a source of  happiness to others. When you are with the person loved, you have no sense  of being bored. This humble and trivial circumstance is the great test--the  only sure and abiding test of love.    8. TWO SOULS COME TOGETHER.--When two souls come together, each seeking to  magnify the other, each in subordinate sense worshiping the other, each  help the other; the two flying together so that each wing-beat of the one  helps each wing-beat of the other--when two souls come together thus, they  are lovers. They who unitedly move themselves away from grossness and from  earth, toward the throne of crystaline and the pavement golden, are,  indeed, true lovers.    {118}    [Illustration: CUPID'S CAPTURED VICTIM.]    The Power and Peculiarities of Love.           *       *       *       *       *    LOVE IS A TONIC AND A REMEDY FOR DISEASE, MAKES PEOPLE LOOK YOUNGER,  CREATES INDUSTRY, ETC.           *       *       *       *       *     \"All thoughts, all passions, all desires,      Whatever stirs this mortal frame,    Are ministers of Love,      And feed his sacred flame.\"    1. It is a physological fact long demonstrated that persons possessing a  loving disposition borrow less of the cares of life, and also live much  longer than persons with a strong, narrow and selfish nature. Persons who  love scenery, love domestic animals, show great attachment for all friends;  love their home dearly and find interest and enchantment in almost  everything have qualities of mind and heart which indicate good health and  a happy disposition.    2. Persons who love music and are constantly humming or whistling a tune,  are persons that need not be feared, they are kind-hearted and with few  exceptions possess a loving disposition. Very few good musicians become  criminals.    3. Parents that cultivate a love among then children will find that the  same feeling will soon be manifested in their children's disposition.  Sunshine in the hearts of the parents will blossom in the lives of the  children. The parent who continually cherishes a feeling of dislike and  rebellion in his soul, cultivating moral hatred against his fellow-man,  will soon find the same things manifested by his son. As the son resembles  his father in looks so he will to a certain extent resemble him in  character. Love in the heart of the parent will beget kindness and  affection in the heart of a child. Continuous scolding and fretting in the  home will soon make love a stranger. {119}    [Illustration: THE TURKISH WAY OF MAKING LOVE]    4. If you desire to cultivate love, create harmony in all your feelings and  faculties. Remember that all that is pure, holy and virtuous in love flows  from the deepest fountain of the human soul. Poison the fountain and you  change virtue to vice, and happiness to misery.    5. Love strengthens health, and disappointment cultivates disease. A person  in love will invariably enjoy the best of health. Ninety-nine per cent. of  our strong constitutioned men, now in physical ruin, have wrecked  themselves on the breakers of an unnatural love. Nothing but right love and  a right marriage will restore them to health.    6. All men feel much better for going a courting, providing they court  purely. Nothing tears the life out of man more than lust, vulgar thoughts  and immoral conduct. The libertine or harlot has changed love, God's purest  gift to man, into lust. They cannot acquire love in its purity again, the  sacred flame has vanished forever. Love is pure, and cannot be found in the  heart of a seducer.    7. A woman is never so bright and full of health as when deeply in love.  Many sickly and frail women are snatched from the clutches of some deadly  disease and restored to health by falling in love.    8. It is a long established fact that married persons are healthier than  unmarried persons; thus it proves that health and happiness belong to the  home. Health depends upon mind. Love places the mind into a delightful  state and quickens every human function, makes the blood circulate and  weaves threads of joy into cables of domestic love.    [Illustration: PREPARING TO ENTERTAIN HER LOVER.]    9. An old but true proverb: \"A true man loving one woman will speak well of  all women. A true woman loving one man will speak well of all men. A good  wife praises all men, but praises her husband most. A good man praises all  women, but praises his wife most.\"    10. Persons deeply in love become peculiarly pleasant, winning and tender.  It is said that a musician can never excel or an artist do his best until  he has been deeply in love. A good orator, a great statesman or great men  in general are greater and better for having once been thoroughly in love.  A man who truly loves his wife and home is always a safe man to trust.    11. Love makes people look younger in years. People in unhappy homes look  older and more worn and fatigued. A woman at thirty, well courted and well  married, looks five or ten years "]]]
