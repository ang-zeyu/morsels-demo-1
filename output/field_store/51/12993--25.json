Had T. X. returned! He slipped from the bed and went to the door, opened  it slightly and listened. T. X. with a search warrant might be a source  of panic especially if--he shrugged his shoulders. He had satisfied T.  X. and allayed his suspicions. He would get Fisher out of the way that  night and make sure.    The voice from the hall below was loud and gruff. Who could it be! Then  he heard Fisher's foot on the stairs and the valet entered.    \"Will you see Mr. Gathercole now!\"    \"Mr. Gathercole!\"    Kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles.    \"Why, of course. Tell him to come up. Ask him if he minds seeing me in  my room.\"    \"I told him you were in bed, sir, and he used shocking language,\" said  Fisher.    Kara laughed.    \"Send him up,\" he said, and then as Fisher was going out of the room he  called him back.    \"By the way, Fisher, after Mr. Gathercole has gone, you may go out for  the night. You've got somewhere to go, I suppose, and you needn't come  back until the morning.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the servant.    Such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him. There was much that  he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially.    \"Perhaps\" Kara hesitated, \"perhaps you had better wait until eleven  o'clock. Bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk. Or  better still, place them on a plate in the hall.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" said the man and withdrew.    Down below, that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged  beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway muttering to  himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain  amused antagonism.    \"Mr. Kara will see you, sir,\" said Fisher.    \"Oh!\" said the other glaring at the unoffending Fisher, \"that's very  good of him. Very good of this person to see a scholar and a gentleman  who has been about his dirty business for three years. Grown grey in his  service! Do you understand that, my man!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Fisher.    \"Look here!\"    The man thrust out his face.    \"Do you see those grey hairs in my beard?\"    The embarrassed Fisher grinned.    \"Is it grey!\" challenged the visitor, with a roar.    \"Yes, sir,\" said the valet hastily.    \"Is it real grey?\" insisted the visitor. \"Pull one out and see!\"    The startled Fisher drew back with an apologetic smile.    \"I couldn't think of doing a thing like that, sir.\"    \"Oh, you couldn't,\" sneered the visitor; \"then lead on!\"    Fisher showed the way up the stairs. This time the traveller carried  no books. His left arm hung limply by his side and Fisher privately  gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket  without its owner being aware of the fact. He pushed open the door and  announced, \"Mr. Gathercole,\" and Kara came forward with a smile to  meet his agent, who, with top hat still on the top of his head, and his  overcoat dangling about his heels, must have made a remarkable picture.    Fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the  hall below. Ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming  voice of the stranger came down to him. Fisher went up the stairs to  meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own  eccentric fashion.    \"No more Patagonia!\" he roared, \"no more Tierra del Fuego!\" he paused.    \"Certainly!\" He replied to some question, \"but not Patagonia,\" he paused  again, and Fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had  occurred to make the visitor so genial.    \"I suppose your cheque will be honoured all right?\" asked the visitor  sardonically, and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he  carefully closed the door.    He came down the corridor talking to himself, and greeted Fisher.    \"Damn all Greeks,\" he said jovially, and Fisher could do no more than  smile reproachfully, the smile being his very own, the reproach being on  behalf of the master who paid him.    The traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand.    \"Never trust a Greek,\" he said, \"always get your money in advance. Is  that clear to you?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Fisher, \"but I think you will always find that Mr. Kara  is always most generous about money.\"    \"Don't you believe it, don't you believe it, my poor man,\" said the  other, \"you--\"    At that moment there came from Kara's room a faint \"clang.\"    \"What's that?\" asked the visitor a little startled.    \"Mr. Kara's put down his steel latch,\" said Fisher with a smile, \"which  means that he is not to be disturbed until--\" he looked at his watch,  \"until eleven o'clock at any rate.\"    \"He's a funk!\" snapped the other, \"a beastly funk!\"    He stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread,  opened the front door without assistance, slammed it behind him and  disappeared into the night.    Fisher, his hands in his pockets, looked after the departing stranger,  nodding his head in reprobation.    \"You're a queer old devil,\" he said, and looked at his watch again.    It wanted five minutes to ten.          CHAPTER XIII    \"IF you would care to come in, sir, I'm sure Lexman would be glad to  see you,\" said T. X.; \"it's very kind of you to take an interest in the  matter.\"    The Chief Commissioner of Police growled something about being paid to  take an interest in everybody and strolled with T. X. down one of the  apparently endless corridors of Scotland Yard.    \"You won't have any bother about the pardon,\" he said. \"I was dining  to-night with old man Bartholomew and he will fix that up in the  morning.\"    \"There will be no necessity to detain Lexman in custody?\" asked T. X.    The Chief shook his head.    \"None whatever,\" he said.    There was a pause, then,    \"By the way, did Bartholomew mention Belinda Mary!\"    The white-haired chief looked round in astonishment.    \"And who the devil is Belinda Mary?\" he asked.    T. X. went red.    \"Belinda Mary,\" he said a little quickly, \"is Bartholomew's daughter.\"    \"By Jove,\" said the Commissioner, \"now you mention it, he did--she is  still in France.\"    \"Oh, is she?\" said T. X. innocently, and in his heart of hearts he  wished most fervently that she was. They came to the room which Mansus  occupied and found that admirable man waiting.    Wherever policemen meet, their conversation naturally drifts to \"shop\"  and in two minutes the three were discussing with some animation and  much difference of opinion, as far as T. X. was concerned, a series  of frauds which had been perpetrated in the Midlands, and which have  nothing to do with this story.    \"Your friend is late,\" said the Chief Commissioner.    \"There he is,\" cried T. X., springing up. He heard a familiar footstep  on the flagged corridor, and sprung out of the room to meet the  newcomer.    For a moment he stood wringing the hand of this grave man, his heart too  full for words.    \"My dear chap!\" he said at last, \"you don't know how glad I am to see  you.\"    John Lexman said nothing, then,    \"I am sorry to bring you into this business, T. X.,\" he said quietly.    \"Nonsense,\" said the other, \"come in and see the Chief.\"    He took John by the arm and led him into the Superintendent's room.    There was a change in John Lexman. A subtle shifting of balance which  was not readily discoverable. His face was older, the mobile mouth a  little more grimly set, the eyes more deeply lined. He was in evening  dress and looked, as T. X. thought, a typical, clean, English gentleman,  such an one as any self-respecting valet would be proud to say he had  \"turned out.\"    T. X. looking at him carefully could see no great change, save that down  one side of his smooth shaven cheek ran the scar of an old wound; which  could not have been much more than superficial.    \"I must apologize for this kit,\" said John, taking off his overcoat and  laying it across the back of a chair, \"but the fact is I was so bored  this evening that I had to do something to pass the time away, so I  dressed and went to the theatre--and was more bored than ever.\"    T. X. noticed that he did not smile and that when he spoke it was slowly  and carefully, as though he were weighing the value of every word.    \"Now,\" he went on, \"I have come to deliver myself into your hands.\"    \"I suppose you have not seen Kara?\" said T. X.    \"I have no desire to see Kara,\" was the short reply.    \"Well, Mr. Lexman,\" broke in the Chief, \"I don't think you are going to  have any difficulty about your escape. By the way, I suppose it was by  aeroplane?\"    Lexman nodded.    \"And you had an assistant?\"    Again Lexman nodded.    \"Unless you press me I would rather not discuss the matter for some  little time, Sir George,\" he said, \"there is much that will happen  before the full story of my escape is made known.\"    Sir George nodded.    \"We will leave it at that,\" he said cheerily, \"and now I hope you have  come back to delight us all with one of your wonderful plots.\"    \"For the time being I have done with wonderful plots,\" said John Lexman  in that even, deliberate tone of his. \"I hope to leave London next week  for New York and take up such of the threads of life as remain. The  greater thread has gone.\"    The Chief Commissioner understood.    The silence which followed was broken by the loud and insistent ringing  of the telephone bell.    \"Hullo,\" said Mansus rising quickly; \"that's Kara's bell.\"    With two quick strides he was at the telephone and lifted down the  receiver.    \"Hullo,\" he cried. \"Hullo,\" he cried again. There was no reply, only  the continuous buzzing, and when he hung up the receiver again, the bell  continued ringing.    The three policemen looked at one another.    \"There's trouble there,\" said Mansus.    \"Take off the receiver,\" said T. X., \"and try again.\"    Mansus obeyed, but there was no response.    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],[0,"Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#19)"],[1,"heat and return to its liquid form.    EMILY.    How rapidly the steam heats the water!    MRS. B.    That is because it does not merely impart its free caloric to the water,  but likewise its latent heat. This method of heating liquids, has been  turned to advantage, in several economical establishments. The  steam-kitchens, which are getting into such general use, are upon the  same principle. The steam is conveyed through a pipe in a similar  manner, into the several vessels which contain the provisions to be  dressed, where it communicates to them its latent caloric, and returns  to the state of water. Count Rumford makes great use of this principle  in many of his fire-places: his grand maxim is to avoid all unnecessary  waste of caloric, for which purpose he confines the heat in such a  manner, that not a particle of it shall unnecessarily escape; and while  he economises the free caloric, he takes care also to turn the latent  heat to advantage. It is thus that he is enabled to produce a degree of  heat superior to that which is obtained in common fire-places, though he  employs less fuel.    EMILY.    When the advantages of such contrivances are so clear and plain,  I cannot understand why they are not universally used.    MRS. B.    A long time is always required before innovations, however useful, can  be reconciled with the prejudices of the vulgar.    EMILY.    What a pity it is that there should be a prejudice against new  inventions; how much more rapidly the world would improve, if such  useful discoveries were immediately and universally adopted!    MRS. B.    I believe, my dear, that there are as many novelties attempted to be  introduced, the adoption of which would be prejudicial to society, as  there are of those which would be beneficial to it. The well-informed,  though by no means exempt from error, have an unquestionable advantage  over the illiterate, in judging what is likely or not to prove  serviceable; and therefore we find the former more ready to adopt such  discoveries as promise to be really advantageous, than the latter, who  having no other test of the value of a novelty but time and experience,  at first oppose its introduction. The well-informed, however, are  frequently disappointed in their most sanguine expectations, and the  prejudices of the vulgar, though they often retard the progress of  knowledge, yet sometimes, it must be admitted, prevent the propagation  of error. --But we are deviating from our subject.    We have converted steam into water, and are now to change water into  ice, in order to render the latent heat sensible, as it escapes from the  water on its becoming solid. For this purpose we must produce a degree  of cold that will make water freeze.    CAROLINE.    That must be very difficult to accomplish in this warm room.    MRS. B.    Not so much as you think. There are certain chemical mixtures which  produce a rapid change from the solid to the fluid state, or the  reverse, in the substances combined, in consequence of which change  latent heat is either extricated or absorbed.    EMILY.    I do not quite understand you.    MRS. B.    This snow and salt, which you see me mix together, are melting rapidly;  heat, therefore, must be absorbed by the mixture, and cold produced.    CAROLINE.    It feels even colder than ice, and yet the snow is melted. This is very  extraordinary.    MRS. B.    The cause of the intense cold of the mixture is to be attributed to the  change from a solid to a fluid state. The union of the snow and salt  produces a new arrangement of their particles, in consequence of which  they become liquid; and the quantity of caloric, required to effect this  change, is seized upon by the mixture wherever it can be obtained. This  eagerness of the mixture for caloric, during its liquefaction, is such,  that it converts part of its own free caloric into latent heat, and it  is thus that its temperature is lowered.    EMILY.    Whatever you put in this mixture, therefore, would freeze?    MRS. B.    Yes; at least any fluid that is susceptible of freezing at that  temperature. I have prepared this mixture of salt and snow for the  purpose of freezing the water from which you are desirous of seeing the  latent heat escape. I have put a thermometer in the glass of water that  is to be frozen, in order that you may see how it cools.    CAROLINE.    The thermometer descends, but the heat which the water is now losing, is  its _free_, not its _latent_ heat.    MRS. B.    Certainly; it does not part with its latent heat till it changes its  state and is converted into ice.    EMILY.    But here is a very extraordinary circumstance! The thermometer is fallen  below the freezing point, and yet the water is not frozen.    MRS. B.    That is always the case previous to the freezing of water when it is in  a state of rest. Now it begins to congeal, and you may observe that the  thermometer again rises to the freezing point.    CAROLINE.    It appears to me very strange that the thermometer should rise the very  moment that the water freezes; for it seems to imply that the water was  colder before it froze than when in the act of freezing.    MRS. B.    It is so; and after our long dissertation on this circumstance, I did  not think it would appear so surprising to you. Reflect a little, and I  think you will discover the reason of it.    CAROLINE.    It must be, no doubt, the extrications of latent heat, at the instant  the water freezes, that raises the temperature.    MRS. B.    Certainly; and if you now examine the thermometer, you will find that  its rise was but temporary, and lasted only during the disengagement of  the latent heat--now that all the water is frozen it falls again, and  will continue to fall till the ice and mixture are of an equal  temperature.    EMILY.    And can you show us any experiments in which liquids, by being mixed,  become solid, and disengage latent heat?    MRS. B.    I could show you several; but you are not yet sufficiently advanced to  understand them well. I shall, however, try one, which will afford you a  striking instance of the fact. The fluid which you see in this phial  consists of a quantity of a certain salt called _muriat of lime_,  dissolved in water. Now, if I pour into it a few drops of this other  fluid, called _sulphuric acid_, the whole, or very nearly the whole,  will be instantaneously converted into a solid mass.    EMILY.    How white it turns! I feel the latent heat escaping, for the bottle is  warm, and the fluid is changed to a solid white substance like chalk!    CAROLINE.    This is, indeed, the most curious experiment we have seen yet. But pray  what is that white vapour that ascends from the mixture?    MRS. B.    You are not yet enough of a chemist to understand that. --But take care,  Caroline, do not approach too near it, for it has a very pungent smell.    I shall show you another instance similar to that of the water, which  you observed to become warmer as it froze. I have in this phial a  solution of a salt called sulphat of soda or Glauber's salt, made very  strong, and corked up when it was hot, and kept without agitation till  it became cold, as you may feel the phial is. Now when I take out the  cork and let the air fall upon it, (for being closed when boiling, there  was a vacuum in the upper part) observe that the salt will suddenly  crystallize. . . .    CAROLINE.    Surprising! how beautifully the needles of salt have shot through the  whole phial!    MRS. B.    Yes, it is very striking--but pray do not forget the object of the  experiment. Feel how warm the phial has become by the conversion of part  of the liquid into a solid.    EMILY.    Quite warm I declare! this is a most curious experiment of the  disengagement of latent heat.    MRS. B.    The slakeing of lime is another remarkable instance of the extrication  of latent heat. Have you never observed how quick-lime smokes when water  is poured upon it, and how much heat it produces?    CAROLINE.    Yes; but I do not understand what change of state takes place in the  lime that occasions its giving out latent heat; for the quick-lime,  which is solid, is (if I recollect right) reduced to powder, by this  operation, and is, therefore, rather expanded than condensed.    MRS. B.    It is from the water, not the lime, that the latent heat is set free.  The water incorporates with, and becomes solid in the lime; in  consequence of which, the heat, which kept it in a liquid state, is  disengaged, and escapes in a sensible form.    CAROLINE.    I always thought that the heat originated in the lime. It seems very  strange that water, and cold water too, should contain so much heat.    EMILY.    After this extrication of caloric, the water must exist in a state of  ice in the lime, since it parts with the heat which kept it liquid.    MRS. B.    It cannot properly be called ice, since ice implies a degree of cold, at  least equal to the freezing point. Yet as water, in combining with lime,  gives out more heat than in freezing, it must be in a state of still  greater solidity in the lime, than it is in the form of ice; and you may  have observed that it does not moisten or liquefy the lime in the  smallest degree.    EMILY.    But, Mrs. B., the smoke that rises is white; if it was only pure caloric  which escaped, we might feel, but could not see it.    MRS. B.    This white vapour is formed by some of the particles of lime, in a state  of fine dust, which are carried off by the caloric.    EMILY.    In all changes of state, then, a body either absorbs or disengages  latent heat?    MRS. B.    You cannot exactly say _absorbs latent heat_, as the heat becomes latent  only on being confined in the body; but you may say, generally, that  bodies, in passing from a solid to a liquid form, or from the liquid  state to that of vapour, absorb heat; and that when the reverse takes  place, heat is disengaged.*        [Footnote *:"]]]
