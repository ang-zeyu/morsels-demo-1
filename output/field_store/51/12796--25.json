For some time  committee members had been urging the War Department to write special  instructions, and finally in February 1944 the department issued a  pamphlet designed to acquaint local commanders with an official  definition of Army racial policy and to improve methods of developing  leaders in black units. _Command of Negro Troops_ was a landmark   (p. 045)  publication.[2-76] Its frank statement of the Army's racial problems,  its scholarly and objective discussion of the disadvantages that  burdened the black soldier, and its outline of black rights and  responsibilities clearly revealed the committee's intention to foster  racial harmony by promoting greater command responsibility. The  pamphlet represented a major departure from previous practice and  served as a model for later Army and Navy statements on race.[2-77]                       [Footnote 2-76: WD PAM 20-6, _Command of Negro                     Troops_, 29 Feb 44.]                       [Footnote 2-77: The Army Service Forces published a                     major supplement to War Department Pamphlet 20-6 in                     October 1944, see Army Service Forces Manual M-5,                     _Leadership and the Negro Soldier_.]    But pamphlets alone would not put an end to racial discrimination; the  committee had to go beyond its role of instructor. Although the War  Department had issued a directive on 10 March 1943 forbidding the  assignment of any recreational facility, \"including theaters and post  exchanges,\" by race and requiring the removal of signs labeling  facilities for \"white\" and \"colored\" soldiers, there had been little  alteration in the recreational situation. The directive had allowed  the separate use of existing facilities by designated units and camp  areas, so that in many places segregation by unit had replaced  separation by race, and inspectors and commanders reported that  considerable confusion existed over the War Department's intentions.  On other posts the order to remove the racial labels from facilities  was simply disregarded. On 8 July 1944 the committee persuaded the War  Department to issue another directive clearly informing commanders  that facilities could be allocated to specific areas or units, but  that all post exchanges and theaters must be opened to all soldiers  regardless of race. All government transportation, moreover, was to be  available to all troops regardless of race. Nor could soldiers be  restricted to certain sections of government vehicles on or off base,  regardless of local customs.[2-78]                       [Footnote 2-78: Ltr, TAG to CG, AAF, et al., 8 Jul                     44, sub: Recreational Facilities, AG 353.8 (5 Jul                     44) OB-S-A-M.]    Little dramatic change ensued in day-to-day life on base. Some  commanders, emphasizing that part of the directive which allowed the  designation of facilities for units and areas, limited the degree of  the directive's application to post exchanges and theaters and ignored  those provisions concerned with individual rights. This interpretation  only added to the racial unrest that culminated in several incidents,  of which the one at the officers' club at Freeman Field, Indiana, was  the most widely publicized.[2-79] After this incident the committee  promptly asked for a revision of WD Pamphlet 20-6 on the command of  black troops that would clearly spell out the intention of the authors  of the directive to apply its integration provisions explicitly to  \"officers' clubs, messes, or similar social organizations.\"[2-80] In  effect the War Department was declaring that racial separation applied  to units only. For the first time it made a clear distinction      (p. 046)  between Army race policy to be applied on federal military reservations  and local civilian laws and customs to be observed by members of the  armed forces when off post. In Acting Secretary Patterson's words:         The War Department has maintained throughout the emergency and       present war that it is not an appropriate medium for effecting       social readjustments but has insisted that all soldiers,       regardless of race, be afforded equal opportunity to enjoy the       recreational facilities which are provided at posts, camps and       stations. The thought has been that men who are fulfilling the       same obligation, suffering the same dislocation of their private       lives, and wearing the identical uniform should, within the       confines of the military establishment, have the same privileges       for rest and relaxation.[2-81]                       [Footnote 2-79: Actually, the use of officers' clubs                     by black troops was clearly implied if not ordained                     in paragraph 19 of Army Regulation 210-10, 20                     December 1940, which stated that any club operating                     on federal property must be open to all officers                     assigned to the post, camp, or station. For more on                     the Freeman Field incident, see Chapter 5, below.]                       [Footnote 2-80: Memo, Secy, Advisory Cmte, for                     Advisory Cmte on Special Troop Policies, 13 Jun 45,                     sub: Minutes of Meeting, ASW 291.2 NT.]                       [Footnote 2-81: Ltr, Actg SW to Gov. Chauncey Sparks                     of Alabama, 1 Sep 44, WDCSA 291.2 (26 Aug 44).]    Widely disseminated by the black press as the \"anti-Jim Crow law,\" the  directive and its interpretation by senior officials produced the  desired result. Although soldiers most often continued to frequent the  facilities in their own base areas, in effect maintaining racial  separation, they were free to use any facilities, and this knowledge  gradually dispelled some of the tensions on posts where restrictions  of movement had been a constant threat to good order.    With some pride, Assistant Secretary McCloy claimed on his Advisory  Committee's first birthday that the Army had \"largely eliminated  discrimination against the Negroes within its ranks, going further in  this direction than the country itself.\"[2-82] He was a little  premature. Not until the end of 1944 did the Advisory Committee  succeed in eliminating the most glaring examples of discrimination  within the Army. Even then race remained an issue, and isolated racial  incidents continued to occur.                       [Footnote 2-82: Ltr, ASW to Herbert B. Elliston,                     Editor, Washington _Post_, 5 Aug 43, ASW 291.2 NT                     (Gen).]      _Two Exceptions_    Departmental policy notwithstanding, a certain amount of racial  integration was inevitable during a war that mobilized a biracial army  of eight million men. Through administrative error or necessity,  segregation was ignored on many occasions, and black and white  soldiers often worked and lived together in hospitals,[2-83] rest camps,  schools, and, more rarely, units. But these were isolated cases,  touching relatively few men, and they had no discernible effect on  racial policy. Of much more importance was the deliberate integration  in officer training schools and in the divisions fighting in the  European theater in 1945. McCloy referred to these deviations from  policy as experiments \"too limited to afford general conclusions.\"[2-84]  But if they set no precedents, they at least challenged the Army's  cherished assumptions on segregation and strengthened the postwar  demands for change.                       [Footnote 2-83: Ltr, USW to Roane Waring, National                     Cmdr, American Legion, 5 May 43, SW 291.2 NT.                     Integrated hospitals did not appear until 1943. See                     Robert J. Parks, \"The Development of Segregation in                     U.S. Army Hospitals, 1940-1942,\" _Military Affairs_                     37 (December 1973): 145-50.]                       [Footnote 2-84: Ltr, ASW to SecNav, 22 Aug 45, ASW                     291.2 NT (Gen).]    The Army integrated its officer candidate training in an effort to  avoid the mistakes of the World War I program. In 1917 Secretary of  War Newton D. Baker had established a separate training school for (p. 047)  black officer candidates at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, with disappointing  results. To fill its quotas the school had been forced to lower its  entrance standards, and each month an arbitrary number of black  officer candidates were selected and graduated with little regard for  their qualifications. Many World War I commanders agreed that the  black officers produced by the school proved inadequate as troop  commanders, and postwar staff studies generally opposed the future use  of black officers. Should the Army be forced to accept black officers  in the future, these commanders generally agreed, they should be  trained along with whites.[2-85]                       [Footnote 2-85: Ltr, William Hastie to Lee Nichols,                     15 Jul 53, in Nichols Collection, CMH; see also                     Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_ pp. 15-20; Army                     War College Misc File 127-1 through 127-22, AMHRC.]    [Illustration: GUN CREW OF BATTERY B, 598TH FIELD ARTILLERY, _moving  into position near the Arno River, Italy, September 1944_.]    Despite these criticisms, mobilization plans between the wars all  assumed that black officers would be trained and commissioned,  although, as the 1937 mobilization plan put it, their numbers would be  limited to those required to provide officers for organizations  authorized to have black officers.[2-86] No detailed plans were drawn up  on the nature of this training, but by the eve of World War II a  policy had become fixed: Negroes were to be chosen and trained  according to the same standards as white officers, preferably in the  same schools.[2-87] The War"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#19)"],[1,"back.  At last, exhausted with fatigue, he fell as if dead into the arms of a  good old Genius, whose fondness for the company of children had made it  his sole occupation to protect them, and who, whilst performing his  wonted rounds through the air, happening on the cruel Giaour at the  instant of his growling in the horrible chasm, rescued the fifty little  victims which the impiety of Vathek had devoted to his maw; these the  Genius brought up in nests still higher than the clouds, and himself  fixed his abode in a nest more capacious than the rest, from which he had  expelled the possessors that had built it.    These inviolable asylums were defended against the Dives and the Afrits  by waving streamers, on which were inscribed, in characters of gold that  flashed like lightning, the names of Allah and the Prophet.  It was there  that Gulchenrouz, who as yet remained undeceived with respect to his  pretended death, thought himself in the mansions of eternal peace, he  admitted without fear the congratulations of his little friends, who were  all assembled in the nest of the venerable Genius, and vied with each  other in kissing his serene forehead and beautiful eyelids.  This he  found to be the state congenial to his soul; remote from the inquietudes  of earth, the impertinence of harems, the brutality of eunuchs, and the  lubricity of women: in this peacable society, his days, months, and years  glided on; nor was he less happy than the rest of his companions; for the  Genius, instead of burthening his pupils with perishable riches and the  vain sciences of the world, conferred upon them the boon of perpetual  childhood.    Carathis, unaccustomed to the loss of her prey, vented a thousand  execrations on her negresses for not seizing the child, instead of  amusing themselves with pinching to death the dwarfs, from which they  could gain no advantage.  She returned into the valley murmuring, and  finding that her son was not risen from the arms of Nouronihar,  discharged her ill-humour upon both.  The idea, however, of departing  next day for Istakar, and cultivating, through the good offices of the  Giaour, an intimacy with Eblis himself, at length consoled her chagrin.  But Fate had ordained it otherwise.    In the evening, as Carathis was conversing with Dilara, who, through her  contrivance, had become of the party, and whose taste resembled her own,  Bababalouk came to acquaint her \"that the sky towards Samarah looked of a  fiery red, and seemed to portend some alarming disaster.\"  Immediately,  recurring to her astrolabes and instruments of magic, she took the  altitude of the planets, and discovered by her calculations, to her great  mortification, that a formidable revolt had taken place at Samarah; that  Motavakel, availing himself of the disgust which was inveterate against  his brother, had incited commotions amongst the populace, made himself  master of the palace, and actually invested the great tower, to which  Morakanabad had retired, with a handful of the few that still remained  faithful to Vathek.    \"What!\" exclaimed she; \"must I lose then my tower! my mutes! my  negresses! my mummies! and, worse than all, the laboratory in which I  have spent so many a night, without knowing at least if my hair-brained  son will complete his adventure?  No!  I will not be the dupe!  Immediately will I speed to support Morakanabad; by my formidable art the  clouds shall sleet hailstones in the faces of the assailants, and shafts  of red-hot iron on their heads; I will spring mines of serpents and  torpedos from beneath them, and we shall soon see the stand they will  make against such an explosion!\"    Having thus spoken, Carathis hastened to her son, who was tranquilly  banqueting with Nouronihar in his superb carnation-coloured tent.    \"Glutton that thou art!\" cried she, \"were it not for me, thou wouldst  soon find thyself the commander only of pies.  Thy faithful subjects have  abjured the faith they swore to thee; Motavakel, thy brother, now reigns  on the hill of pied horses, and had I not some slight resources in the  tower, would not be easily persuaded to abdicate; but, that time may not  be lost, I shall only add four words: Strike tent to-night, set forward,  and beware how thou loiterest again by the way; though thou hast  forfeited the conditions of the parchment, I am not yet without hope; for  it cannot be denied that thou hast violated to admiration the laws of  hospitality, by seducing the daughter of the Emir, after having partaken  of his bread and his salt.  Such a conduct cannot but be delightful to  the Giaour; and if on thy march thou canst signalise thyself by an  additional crime, all will still go well, and thou shalt enter the palace  of Soliman in triumph.  Adieu!  Alboufaki and my negresses are waiting.\"    The Caliph had nothing to offer in reply; he wished his mother a  prosperous journey, and ate on till he had finished his supper.  At  midnight the camp broke up, amidst the flourishing of trumpets and other  martial instruments; but loud indeed must have been the sound of the  tymbals to overpower the blubbering of the Emir and his long-beards, who,  by an excessive profusion of tears, had so far exhausted the radical  moisture, that their eyes shrivelled up in their sockets, and their hairs  dropped off by the roots.  Nouronihar, to whom such a symphony was  painful, did not grieve to get out of hearing; she accompanied the Caliph  in the imperial litter, where they amused themselves with imagining the  splendour which was soon to surround them.  The other women, overcome  with dejection, were dolefully rocked in their cages, whilst Dilara  consoled herself with anticipating the joy of celebrating the rites of  fire on the stately terraces of Istakar.    In four days they reached the spacious valley of Rocnabad.  The season of  spring was in all its vigour, and the grotesque branches of the almond  trees in full blossom fantastically chequered the clear blue sky; the  earth, variegated with hyacinths and jonquils, breathed forth a fragrance  which diffused through the soul a divine repose; myriads of bees, and  scarce fewer of Santons, had there taken up their abode; on the banks of  the stream hives and oratories were alternately ranged, and their  neatness and whiteness were set off by the deep green of the cypresses  that spired up amongst them.  These pious personages amused themselves  with cultivating little gardens that abounded with flowers and fruits,  especially musk-melons of the best flavour that Persia could boast;  sometimes dispersed over the meadow, they entertained themselves with  feeding peacocks whiter than snow, and turtles more blue than the  sapphire; in this manner were they occupied when the harbingers of the  imperial procession began to proclaim: \"Inhabitants of Rocnabad!  prostrate yourselves on the brink of your pure waters, and tender your  thanksgivings to Heaven, that vouchsafeth to show you a ray of its glory;  for lo! the Commander of the Faithful draws near.\"    The poor Santons, filled with holy energy, having bustled to light up wax  torches in their oratories and expand the Koran on their ebony desks,  went forth to meet the Caliph with baskets of honeycomb, dates, and  melons.  But, whilst they were advancing in solemn procession and with  measured steps, the horses, camels, and guards wantoned over their tulips  and other flowers, and made a terrible havoc amongst them.  The Santons  could not help casting from one eye a look of pity on the ravages  committing around them, whilst the other was fixed upon the Caliph and  heaven.  Nouronihar, enraptured with the scenery of a place which brought  back to her remembrance the pleasing solitudes where her infancy had  passed, entreated Vathek to stop; but he, suspecting that each oratory  might be deemed by the Giaour a distinct habitation, commanded his  pioneers to level them all; the Santons stood motionless with horror at  the barbarous mandate, and at last broke out into lamentations; but these  were uttered with so ill a grace, that Vathek bade his eunuchs to kick  them from his presence.  He then descended from the litter with  Nouronihar; they sauntered together in the meadow, and amused themselves  with culling flowers, and passing a thousand pleasantries on each other.  But the bees, who were staunch Mussulmans, thinking it their duty to  revenge the insult on their dear masters the Santons, assembled so  zealously to do it with effect, that the Caliph and Nouronihar were glad  to find their tents prepared to receive them.    Bababalouk, who in capacity of purveyor had acquitted himself with  applause as to peacocks and turtles, lost no time in consigning some  dozens to the spit, and as many more to be fricasseed.  Whilst they were  feasting, laughing, carousing, and blaspheming at pleasure on the banquet  so liberally furnished, the Moullahs, the Sheiks, the Cadis and Imams of  Schiraz (who seemed not to have met the Santons) arrived, leading by  bridles of riband inscribed from the Koran, a train of asses, which were  loaded with the choicest fruits the country could boast; having presented  their offerings to the Caliph, they petitioned him to honour their city  and mosques with his presence.    \"Fancy not,\" said Vathek, \"that you can detain me; your presents I  condescend to accept, but beg you will let me be quiet, for I am not  over-fond of resisting temptation; retire, then; yet, as it is not decent  for personages so reverend to return on foot, and as you have not the  appearance of expert riders, my eunuchs shall tie you on your asses, with  the precaution that your backs be not turned towards me, for they  understand etiquette.\"    In this deputation were some high-stomached Sheiks, who, taking Vathek  for a fool, scrupled not to speak their opinion.  These Bababalouk girded  with double cords, and, having well disciplined their asses with nettles  behind,"]]]
