[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19979"],[0,"A Righte Merrie Christmasse: The Story of Christ-Tide (#19)"],[1," were made into Christmas pies of various kinds. Plum puddings were  made, and the mince meat, cunningly prepared some weeks beforehand,  was made into mince pies of all sorts, sizes, and shapes. Yule  'clogs,' as they are here called, were sawn or chopped in readiness,  and a stock laid in sufficient to last the whole of one or two  evenings.    \"In well-regulated houses it was usual to have all the preparations  and the housework completed by early in the afternoon of Christmas  Eve, and after an early tea in parlour and kitchen--the servants,  clean and neat, piled up the Yule clogs in the rooms, getting the  large ones well alight, and keeping them going by smaller knots of  wood. Long, large, white Christmas Candles were lighted, set in  old-fashioned, time-honoured, brass candlesticks, accompanied by  equally old and honoured brass snuffers and trays, all bright and  shining. Of candles, there was no lack, and when all were fairly  going, parlour and kitchen presented a blaze of warm, ruddy light,  only seen once in the year. In both rooms the Christmas Eve tables  were laid with snowy linen, and set for feasting, with all the good  things provided. On each table would be a large piece of beef, and a  ham, flanked by the pies and other good things, including a Christmas  Cheese.    \"About six in the evening, the chief item of the feast was prepared.  This was hot spiced ale, usually of a special brew. This was prepared  by the gallon in a large kettle, or iron pot, which stood, for the  purpose, on the hob. The ale was poured in, made quite hot, but not  allowed to boil, and then sugar and spice were added according to  taste, some women having a special mode of making the brew. When  ready, the hot ale was ladled into bowls,--the large earthenware ones  now so rare. A white one, with blue decorations, was used in the  parlour, a commoner one, of the yellowish earthenware kind, with rough  blue or other coloured bands for ornamentation, being for the kitchen.  These, nearly full of the steaming brew, were carried to the tables.  Whoever then dropped in, and usually there were many, to see parlour  or kitchen company, had to drink from these bowls, lifting the bowl to  the lips with both hands, expressing a good seasonable wish, and  taking a hearty drink. The visitors then partook of anything on the  table they liked, and one and all were treated bountifully. Soon, as  the company arrived, the fun increased in parlour and kitchen,  particularly in the latter, as the womenkind went through the  old-fashioned ceremony under the mistletoe, which was hung aloft from  a highly-decorated 'kissing-bunch.'    \"All sorts of games and fun went on till about ten o'clock, as a rule,  about which time the master, mistress, and family, with the rest of  the parlour company, visited the kitchen. Then the steaming ale bowl  was refilled, and all, beginning with the master and the mistress, in  turn drank from the bowl. This over, the parlour company remained, and  entered into the games for a time. There was always some one who could  sing a suitable song; and one, if song it can be called, was:         \"_The Folks' Song._         \"When me an' my folks       Come to see you an' your folks,       Let you an' your folks       Treat me an' my folks       As kind, as me an' my folks       Treated you an' your folks,       When you an' your folks       Came to see me an' my folks,       Sure then! never were such folks       Since folks were folks!    \"This was sung several times over with the last two lines as a chorus.  The proceedings in the kitchen closed with another general sup from  the replenished bowl, the parlour folks returning to the parlour.  During the evening the proceedings were varied by visits from  Christmas singers and the mummers, all of whom were well entertained.  Usually, if the weather was fit, the kitchen folks wound up the night  with a stroll, dropping in to see friends at other houses. As a rule,  soon after midnight the feastings were over, but most folks never  thought of retiring till they heard the bands of singers in the  distance singing the morning hymn, 'Christians, awake!'\"    A very old custom was that of \"wassailing\" the fruit trees on  Christmas eve, although it obtained on other days, such as New Year's  day and Twelfth day. Herrick says:         Wassaile the Trees that they may beare       You many a Plum and many a Peare;       For more or lesse fruits they will bring,       As you do give them Wassailing.    This custom of drinking to the trees and pouring forth libations to  them differs according to the locality. In some parts of Devonshire it  used to be customary for the farmer, with his family and friends,  after partaking together of hot cakes and cider (the cakes being  dipped in the liquor previous to being eaten), to proceed to the  orchard, one of the party bearing hot cake and cider as an offering to  the principal apple tree. The cake was formally deposited on the fork  of the tree, and the cider thrown over it.    In the neighbourhood of the New Forest the following lines are sung at  the wassailing of the trees:         Apples and pears, with right good corn       Come in plenty to every one;       Eat and drink good cake and hot ale,       Give earth to drink, and she'll not fail.    Horsfield, who wrote of Sussex, speaks somewhat at length of this  subject, and says that the wassail bowl was compounded of ale, sugar,  nutmeg, and roasted apples, the latter called \"lambs' wool.\" The  wassail bowl is placed on a small round table, and each person present  is furnished with a silver spoon to stir. They then walk round the  table as they go, and stirring with the right hand, and every  alternate person passes at the same time under the arm of his  preceding neighbour. The wassailing (or \"worsling,\" as it is termed in  West Sussex) of the fruit trees is considered a matter of grave  importance, and its omission is held to bring ill luck, if not the  loss of all the next crop. Those who engage in the ceremony are called  \"howlers.\"    The farm labourers, or boys (says Horsfield), after the day's toil is  ended, assemble in a group to wassail the apple trees, etc. The  trumpeter of the party is furnished with a cow's horn, with which he  makes sweet music. Thus equipped, they call on the farmer, and  inquire, \"please, sir, do you want your trees worsled?\" They then  proceed to the orchard, and encircling one of the largest and  best-bearing trees, chant in a low voice a certain doggerel rhyme; and  this ended, all shout in chorus, with the exception of the trumpeter,  who blows a loud blast. During the ceremony they rap the trees with  their sticks. \"Thus going from tree to tree, or group to group, they  wassail the whole orchard; this finished, they proceed to the house of  the owner, and sing at his door a song common on the occasion. They  are then admitted, and, placing themselves around the kitchen fire,  enjoy the sparkling ale and the festivities of the season.\"    There are two wassail rhymes in Sussex:         \"Stand fast, root; bear well, top;       Pray the God send us a good howling crop.       Every twig, apples big;       Every bough, apples enow.       Hats full, caps full,       Full quarters, sacks full.            Holloa, boys, holloa! Hurrah!\"    The other is:         \"Here's to thee, old apple tree;       May'st thou bud, may'st thou blow,       May'st thou bear apples enow!       Hats full! Caps full!       Bushel, bushel sacks full!       And my pockets full, too!                          Hurrah!\"    In the _Gentleman's Magazine_ (January 1820, p. 33) mention is made of  \"an ancient superstitious custom obtaining at Tretyre, in  Herefordshire, upon Christmas Eve. They make a cake, poke a stick  through it, fasten it upon the horn of an ox, and say certain words,  begging a good crop of corn for the master. The men and boys attending  the oxen range themselves around. If the ox throws the cake behind it  belongs to the men; if before, to the boys. They take with them a  wooden bottle of cyder, and drink it, repeating the charm before  mentioned.\"    There is a curious custom at Downside College, near Bath. On Christmas  eve the scholars of this well-known institution proceed to the  election of their king and other officers of his household, consisting  of the mayor of the palace, etc. His reign lasts fourteen days, during  which period there are many good feasts; a room in the college being  fitted up in fine style, and used by his Majesty as his palace. At  Oxford, too, in pre-Reformation time, at Merton College, they had a  king of Christmas, or misrule; at St. John's he was styled lord, and  at Trinity he was emperor!    There is a rather rough but pretty west country carol for Christmas  eve, which is to be found in Davies Giddy, or Gilbert's _Ancient  Christmas Carols, etc._, and which, he says, was chanted in private  houses on Christmas eve throughout the west of England up to the  latter part of the last century.         The Lord at first did Adam make         Out of the dust and clay,       And in his nostrils breathed life,         E'en as the Scriptures say.       And then in Eden's Paradise         He placed him to dwell,       That he, within it, should remain,         To dress and keep it well.           _Now let good Christians all begin           An holy life to live,           And to rejoice and merry be,           For this is Christmas Eve._         And then within the garden he         Commanded was to stay,       And unto him in commandment         These words the Lord did say:       \"The fruit which in the garden grows         To thee shall be for meat,       Except the tree in the midst thereof,         Of which thou shall not eat.\"           _Now let good Christians, etc._         \"For in the day that thou shall eat,         Or to it then come nigh;       For if that thou doth eat thereof,         Then surely thou shalt die.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#19)"],[1,"solemnly accept the  responsibility of it, as it is the helm and guide of labour far and  near.      119. For you who have it in your hands are in reality the pilots of the  power and effort of the State. It is entrusted to you as an authority to  be used for good or evil, just as completely as kingly authority was  ever given to a prince, or military command to a captain. And, according  to the quantity of it that you have in your hands, you are the arbiters  of the will and work of England; and the whole issue, whether the work  of the State shall suffice for the State or not, depends upon you. You  may stretch out your sceptre over the heads of the English labourers,  and say to them, as they stoop to its waving, \"Subdue this obstacle that  has baffled our fathers, put away this plague that consumes our  children; water these dry places, plough these desert ones, carry this  food to those who are in hunger; carry this light to those who are in  darkness; carry this life to those who are in death;\" or on the other  side you may say to her labourers: \"Here am I; this power is in my hand;  come, build a mound here for me to be throned upon, high and wide; come,  make crowns for my head, that men may see them shine from far away;  come, weave tapestries for my feet, that I may tread softly on the silk  and purple; come, dance before me, that I may be gay; and sing sweetly  to me, that I may slumber; so shall I live in joy, and die in honour.\"  And better than such an honourable death it were that the day had  perished wherein we were born, and the night in which it was said there  is a child conceived.      120. I trust that in a little while there will be few of our rich men  who, through carelessness or covetousness, thus forfeit the glorious  office which is intended for their hands. I said, just now, that wealth  ill-used was as the net of the spider, entangling and destroying: but  wealth well used is as the net of the sacred fisher who gathers souls of  men out of the deep. A time will come--I do not think even now it is  far from us--when this golden net of the world's wealth will be spread  abroad as the flaming meshes of morning cloud are over the sky; bearing  with them the joy of light and the dew of the morning, as well as the  summons to honourable and peaceful toil. What less can we hope from your  wealth than this, rich men of England, when once you feel fully how, by  the strength of your possessions--not, observe, by the exhaustion, but  by the administration of them and the power,--you can direct the  acts--command the energies--inform the ignorance--prolong the existence,  of the whole human race; and how, even of worldly wisdom, which man  employs faithfully, it is true, not only that her ways are pleasantness,  but that her paths are peace; and that, for all the children of men, as  well as for those to whom she is given, Length of days is in her right  hand, as in her left hand Riches and Honour?          ADDENDA    Note, p. 18.--\"_Fatherly authority._\"      121. This statement could not, of course, be heard without displeasure  by a certain class of politicians; and in one of the notices of these  lectures given in the Manchester journals at the time, endeavour was  made to get quit of it by referring to the Divine authority, as the only  Paternal power with respect to which men were truly styled \"brethren.\"  Of course it is so, and, equally of course, all human government is  nothing else than the executive expression of this Divine authority. The  moment government ceases to be the practical enforcement of Divine law,  it is tyranny; and the meaning which I attach to the words \"paternal  government,\" is, in more extended terms, simply this--\"The executive  fulfilment, by formal human methods, of the will of the Father of  mankind respecting His children.\" I could not give such a definition of  Government as this in a popular lecture; and even in written form, it  will necessarily suggest many objections, of which I must notice and  answer the most probable.    Only, in order to avoid the recurrence of such tiresome phrases as \"it  may be answered in the second place,\" and \"it will be objected in the  third place,\" etc., I will ask the reader's leave to arrange the  discussion in the form of simple dialogue, letting _O._ stand for  objector, and _R._ for response.      122. _O._--You define your paternal government to be the executive  fulfilment, by formal human methods, of the Divine will. But, assuredly,  that will cannot stand in need of aid or expression from human laws. It  cannot fail of its fulfilment.      _R._ 122. In the final sense it cannot; and in that sense, men who are  committing murder and stealing are fulfilling the will of God as much as  the best and kindest people in the world. But in the limited and present  sense, the only sense with which _we_ have anything to do, God's will  concerning man is fulfilled by some men, and thwarted by others. And  those men who either persuade or enforce the doing of it, stand towards  those who are rebellious against it exactly in the position of faithful  children in a family, who, when the father is out of sight, either  compel or persuade the rest to do as their father would have them, were  he present; and in so far as they are expressing and maintaining, for  the time, the paternal authority, they exercise, in the exact sense in  which I mean the phrase to be understood, paternal government over the  rest.    _O._--But, if Providence has left a liberty to man in many things in  order to prove him, why should human law abridge that liberty, and take  upon itself to compel what the great Lawgiver does not compel?      123. _R._--It is confessed, in the enactment of any law whatsoever, that  human lawgivers have a right to do this. For, if you have no right to  abridge any of the liberty which Providence has left to man, you have no  right to punish any one for committing murder or robbery. You ought to  leave them to the punishment of God and Nature. But if you think  yourself under obligation to punish, as far as human laws can, the  violation of the will of God by these great sins, you are certainly  under the same obligation to punish, with proportionately less  punishment, the violation of His will in less sins.    _O._--No; you must not attempt to punish less sins by law, because you  cannot properly define nor ascertain them. Everybody can determine  whether murder has been committed or not, but you cannot determine how  far people have been unjust or cruel in minor matters, and therefore  cannot make or execute laws concerning minor matters.    _R._--If I propose to you to punish faults which cannot be defined, or  to execute laws which cannot be made equitable, reject the laws I  propose. But do not generally object to the principle of law.    _O._--Yes; I generally object to the principle of law as applied to  minor things; because, if you could succeed (which you cannot) in  regulating the entire conduct of men by law in little things as well as  great, you would take away from human life all its probationary  character, and render many virtues and pleasures impossible. You would  reduce virtue to the movement of a machine, instead of the act of a  spirit.      124. _R._--You have just said, parenthetically, and I fully and  willingly admit it, that it is impossible to regulate all minor matters  by law. Is it not probable, therefore, that the degree in which it is  _possible_ to regulate them by it, is also the degree in which it is  _right_ to regulate them by it? Or what other means of judgment will you  employ, to separate the things which ought to be formally regulated from  the things which ought not? You admit that great sins should be legally  repressed; but you say that small sins should not be legally repressed.  How do you distinguish between great and small sins? and how do you  intend to determine, or do you in practice of daily life determine, on  what occasions you should compel people to do right, and on what  occasions you should leave them the option of doing wrong?    _O._--I think you cannot make any accurate or logical distinction in  such matters; but that common sense and instinct have, in all civilised  nations, indicated certain crimes of great social harmfulness, such as  murder, theft, adultery, slander, and such like, which it is proper to  repress legally; and that common sense and instinct indicate also the  kind of crimes which it is proper for laws to let alone, such as  miserliness, ill-natured speaking, and many of those commercial  dishonesties which I have a notion you want your paternal government to  interfere with.    _R._--Pray do not alarm yourself about what my paternal government is  likely to interfere with, but keep to the matter in hand. You say that  \"common sense and instinct\" have, in all civilised nations,  distinguished between the sins that ought to be legally dealt with and  that ought not. Do you mean that the laws of all civilised nations are  perfect?    _O._--No; certainly not.    _R._--Or that they are perfect at least in their discrimination of what  crimes they should deal with, and what crimes they should let alone?    _O._--No; not exactly.    _R._--What _do_ you mean, then?      125. _O._--I mean that the general tendency is right in the laws of  civilised nations; and that, in due course of time, natural sense and  instinct point out the matters they should be brought to bear upon. And  each question of legislation must be made a separate subject of inquiry  as it presents itself: you cannot fix any general principles about what  should be dealt with legally, and what should not.    _R._--Supposing it to be so, do you think there are any points in which  our English legislation is capable of amendment, as it bears on  commercial and economical matters, in this present time?    _O._--Of course I do.    _R._--Well, then, let us discuss these together"]]]
