Take three times  their weight in sugar, put a pint of water to a pint of roses, skin  well, shred the roses a little before you put them into the water, and  cover them, and when the leaves are tender, put in the sugar.    Keep stirring lest they burn and the syrup be consumed.      Delicious Fudge    Delicious fudge is made with sour cream instead of fresh milk or cream.      Taffy              2 lbs. brown sugar            1 tablespoon butter            1 tablespoon golden syrup            3/4 cup water            1 teaspoon vanilla            1 tablespoon white vinegar    Mix well and allow it to boil slowly. Skim but do not stir. Boil until a  little hardens in water. Then add the vanilla and vinegar.    Now pour into buttered tins and when the edges harden, draw lightly to  the center. When cool pull until light. When doing so flour the hands  lightly.      Creole Balls    Chop half a cupful each of almonds, pecans and walnuts and add enough  fondant to make the mixture of the right consistency to mold into  bonbons. Boil into little balls and dip in maple or chocolate fondant.

Test by dropping  little in water. If it hardens quickly, remove at once from the fire.  Add vanilla and pour into buttered pans.    When cool, cut in squares with a buttered knife.      Sea Foam    For sea foam candy cook three cupfuls of light brown sugar, a cupful of  water and a tablespoon of vinegar until the syrup forms a hard ball when  dropped into cold water. Pour it slowly over the stiffly beaten whites  of two eggs, beating continually until the candy is stiff enough to hold  its shape. Then work in half a cupful of chopped nuts and half a  teaspoon of vanilla. Drop in small pieces on waxed paper.      How to Make Good Coffee    When the National Coffee Roasters' Association tells how to make good  coffee the housewife is naturally interested, no matter how fervently  the family may praise her own brew. Coffee is the business of these  gentlemen. They know it from the scientific standpoint as well as  practically. Their opinion as to the best method of preparing it for the  table is, therefore, worth consideration.    They tell us, first of all, that the virtues of the infusion depend  primarily upon the fineness with which the roasted bean is ground.  Careful experiments have shown, indeed, that when pulverized it gives a  larger yield of full strength beverage than in any other shape, so that  such grinding is urged in the interest of economy, as well as from a  gastronomic standpoint.    The grinding, however, must be done immediately before the coffee is  made. Otherwise no little of the delicate and much prized flavor of the  bean will escape.    The method of making the infusion is governed by the solubility of the  various elements composing the coffee. The caffeine and caffetannic acid  readily dissolve in cold water, but the delicate flavoring oils require  a considerable degree of heat. It so happens that water at the boiling  point, 212 deg. F., is twice as effective in extracting these flavors as  when at a temperature of 150 deg. F.    Nevertheless, the usual method of boiling the coffee is unsparingly  condemned by the association. The infusion thus made is very high in  caffeine and tannic acid. It is muddy, too, and overrich in dissolved  fibrous and bitter matters. As most of the deleterious effects of coffee  are due to dissolved tannin, owing to excessive boiling or the use of  grounds a second time, this method of making the beverage is  unqualifiedly condemned.    Steeping--that is, placing the coffee in cold water and permitting it to  come to a boil--is also deprecated. An infusion so made contains less  caffeine, to be sure, but it lacks the desired aromatic flavor and the  characteristic coffee taste.    In fine, the association leans to a method of coffee making known as  filtration. This consists in pouring boiling water once through finely  pulverized coffee confined in a close-meshed muslin bag. The resultant  infusion is one in which the percentage of tannin is extremely low.  There is a medium amount of caffeine, but the full flavor and  characteristic taste are present.

Editress Suffrage Cook Book:              This is to acknowledge yours of the 16th instant,            in reference to women's suffrage, and in reply            will say that while this right has been enjoyed            but a short time by our women, they have been            making excellent use of it. They are prompt to            register and vote, and their influence is most            always found upon the side of better government.            The result of their efforts is already being            reflected in a number of important measures            recently adopted in this state, which will make            for the public good.                                        Very truly yours,                                             OSWALD WEST.                                                     Governor.    [Illustration]      Cottage Cheese    To make cottage cheese effectively, with an aroma and delicacy equal to  its nourishment, a rich milk which has not lost time in souring should  be put in an earthenware or stone jar with the lid on, and placed in hot  water over a very slow fire until it is well heated with the curd  clotted from the whey. When it begins to steam the curd is drained a  very short period through cheese cloth. Well mixed with salt and butter  and pepper it is an ideal muscle and tissue maker.    Cottage cheese is much more easily turned into brawn, brain and bone  than any of the less porous, less ripe cheeses. In fact the curious  uncomfortably bloated sensation experienced by many who eat other  varieties of cheese is uncommon with cottage cheese.    Faulty mastication, peculiar susceptibilities to casein and an excess of  other solid foods often causes the distress which follows cheese eating.  If well emulsified with saliva by the teeth or mixed with water and not  gulped down, cottage cheese serves every sort of food purpose.          ALBUMINOUS BEVERAGES              The following recipes were kindly contributed by            Alida Frances Pattee, author of \"Practical            Dietetics,\" an invaluable book for the home.      When a large amount of nutriment is required the albuminized drinks are  valuable.    The egg is a fluid food until its albumen is coagulated by heat. Often  the white of egg, dissolved in water or milk, and flavored, is given  when the yolk cannot be digested, as 30 per cent. of the yolk is fat.  Egg-nog is very nutritious, and is extensively prescribed in certain  non-febrile diseases, especially for the forced alimentation of phthisis  and melancholia. There are occasional cases of bilious habit, in which  eggs to be digested must be beaten in wine. But the combination of egg,  milk and sugar with alcohol, which constitutes egg-nog, is apt to  produce nausea and vomiting in a feeble stomach, especially in fever.  For this reason whole eggs are unfit for fever patients, and the whites  only should be used.    Albuminized drinks are most easily prepared cold. When a hot liquid is  used, it must be poured very slowly into the well-beaten egg, stirring  constantly, so that lumps of coagulated albumen do not form.    _For the Diabetic._ In all the albuminous drinks substitute Sweetina for  the sugar.

Perhaps some of the very sparrows that spend the winter in silence in  northeastern Kansas trill their finest arias in their summer homes on  the shores of Lake Minnetonka or in the boggy hollows in the  neighborhood of Duluth.    When I first began to plan for moving back to Ohio, I was foolish  enough to fear that the song sparrows of that state might have changed  their habits during the years of my absence, and that I should be  disappointed in them: but no need of borrowing trouble on their  account, for they were the same blithe and familiar birds, trilling  their sweetest chansons in the trees in the residence portion of the  town in which I lived.  And sing!  Were there ever birds with more  dulcet tones, with finer voice register, or with a greater variety of  tunes in their repertoire?    Going back to Kansas in winter, we note that the song sparrows, instead  of remaining at one place, shifted about a good deal more than I had  ever known them to do in the East.  In December a pair found a dwelling  in the weed clumps and brush heaps of a hollow a short distance from  the Missouri River; but they soon deserted this spot, well sheltered as  it was, none being seen there until the twenty-third of February.  It  surprised me to find another pair, and sometimes two pairs, in a  thicket right on the bank of the wide river, where they were exposed to  many of the winter blasts, especially those that swept down from the  frozen north.  Up in the deep, winding ravine they might have had  excellent shelter and, so far as I could see, just as good feeding.  However, I have long ago learned that there is no accounting for tastes  in the bird realm any more than in the human realm.    The hardiest of the _Mniotiltidae_ tribe are the myrtle warblers, which  dapple the whitened edges of winter, both autumn and spring, with their  golden rumps and amber brooches.  Evidently these birds are shyer of  the rigorous Ohio winters than of the more mild-mannered Kansas  weather.  In the former state I never saw a myrtle warbler after the  first or second week in November, while in Kansas I came upon a flock  of them in a wooded hollow by the river on the eighth of December,  1897, and then after a severe snowstorm had swept over the region from  the western prairies.  It seemed odd to find these dainty featherland  blossoms when the whole country was covered with an ermine of snow.    Then they disappeared, and I did not expect to see them again until the  next spring; but on the fourteenth of February, which was a warm,  vernal day thrust into the midst of winter, a flock of perhaps a dozen  were flitting and chirping among the trees in the suburbs of the city,  their hoarse little _chep_, always giving one the impression that the  birds have taken a cold which has affected their vocal cords, sounding  as familiar as of old.  However, that very evening at dusk a black  cloud, charged with electricity and bellowing with anger, came up out  of the west like a young Lochinvar, and hurled a fierce storm across  the hills and valleys, and the next day not a myrtle warbler was to be  seen in all the countryside, though I tramped weary miles in search of  them.  The tempest had doubtless frightened them away to the suaver  southland, from which they did not return until the following spring.    One of my most pleasing observations was made on December 19, 1902.  There had been a number of days of severe weather, accompanied by hard  storms.  Six inches of snow lay on the ground.  Now the storm had spent  its force, the sun was shining genially, and the snow was melting.  Warm as it was, I was greatly surprised to find a flock of myrtle  warblers in the woods so late in the season.  They had braved the  storms of the preceding week, and were as chipper and active as myrtle  warblers could be.  But their employment was a still greater surprise.  They were darting about in the air among the treetops, as well as amid  the bushes in the deep ravine, catching insects on the wing.  That  insects should be flying after the wintry weather of the previous week  was still more surprising than that the warblers should be here to dine  upon them.  Soon after that day, however, the little yellow-rumps must  have taken the wing route to a more genial climate, for they were seen  no more that winter.    Of a more permanent character was the residence of the jolly juncos,  which dwelt all winter in northeastern Kansas, let the weather be never  so lowering.  Always active and alert, flitting from bush to weed, and  from the snow-carpeted ground to the gnarled oak saplings, now  pilfering a dinner of wild berries and now a luncheon of weed seeds,  they seemed to generate enough warmth in their trig little bodies to  defy old Boreas to do his best.  Water flowing from melting snow must  be ice-cold, yet the juncos plunged into the crystal pools and rinsed  their plumes with as much apparent relish as if their lavatory were  tepid instead of icy, and as if balmy instead of nipping winds were  blowing.    One day I watched a member of this family taking his dinner of wild  grapes.  Finding a dark red cluster, he would pick off the juiciest  berry he could reach, press it daintily between his white mandibles for  a few moments, swallow a part of the pulp, and drop the rest to the  ground.  What part of the grape did he eat?  That is the precise  problem I could not solve with certainty, for on examining the rejected  portions that had been flung to the ground I found that one seed still  remained, together with part of the pulp and all of the broken rind.  I  half suspect, though, that Master Junco likes to tipple a little--never  enough, however, be it remembered, to make him reel or lose his senses.  No! no! a toper Master Junco is not; he is too sane a bird for that!  Would that all the citizens of our republic would display as much sound  judgment and self-control.    Where all the birds sleep on biting winter nights it would be difficult  to say, but the acute little juncos lease the farmer's corn shocks hard  by the woods.  At dusk you may startle a dozen of them from a single  shock.  They dart pellmell from their hiding places, chippering their  protest, and when you examine the shock you find cozy nooks and ingles  among the leaves and stalks, where they find couches and at the same  time coverts from the sharp winds.  As you stand at the border of the  woods in the gloaming you can hear the rustling of the fodder as the  juncos move about in their tepees, trying to find the choicest and  snuggest berths.  Usually they select the tops of the standing shocks,  perhaps for safety; yet some may be found also in the shocks that have  partly fallen to the ground.    In the latter part of February the juncos began to rehearse their  spring songs, which were a welcome sound in the almost unbroken silence  of the winter.  The nearer the spring approached, the higher they  mounted in the trees, and the more prolonged was their flight, as if  they were practicing their wing exercises to inure their muscles to the  strain that would be put upon them when they undertook their long  journey to their northern summer homes; for, of course, the juncos do  not breed in our central latitudes, but hie to the northern part of the  United States and the Dominion of Canada.    In Ohio the brown creepers and the golden-crowned kinglets were  constant winter companions in the woods; but, although Kansas is  considerably farther south, they do not seem to be winter residents  there--at least, not in the northeastern part of the state--the only  exception being that in January, 1903, several creepers were observed  in my yard.  One may well wonder why these birds are winter residents  in Ohio and only migrants in a latitude that is two degrees farther  south.    There was some scant compensation in the presence of the winter wren  one winter in the Sunflower state.  The fourteenth of December brought  one of these brown Lilliputians to a deep hollow in town, where he  chattered petulantly and scampered along an old paling fence.  No more  winter wrens were seen until January seventh, when one darted out of  some bushes on the bank of a stream about two miles south of town.  My  next jaunt to this hollow took place on the twenty-seventh, when, to my  surprise, a hermit thrush was seen in a clump of bushes and saplings--a  bird that I supposed had been sunning himself for at least a month in  the genial South.  While tramping about trying to get another view of  the unconventional thrush, I frightened a winter wren from a cluster of  weeds and bushes.  My! how alarmed he was!  Uttering a loud chirp, he  darted down to the center of the stream and slipped into a little cave  formed by ice and snow frozen over a clump of low bushes.  There he hid  himself like an Eskimo in his snow hut.  My trudging near by frightened  the bird out of the farther doorway, and he dashed away pellmell,  hurling a saucy gird of protestation at me, and was seen by me no more.  I examined the little snow house.  It was very cunning indeed, and  might well have made a cozy shelter for the little wren in stormy  weather.  My next meeting with a winter wren occurred on the fifteenth  of February, in the same hollow, but about an eighth of a mile nearer  the river.  A query arises here: Did I see four different winter wrens  during the winter, or only one in four different localities?  Who can  tell?    That is not all about the winter wrens.  My first winter in Kansas was  the severest I experienced in that state; yet it was the only winter of  the five I spent in Kansas that brought me the winter wren.  If it  would do any good, one might ask again the question why.  Although the  winter wren is a migrant in Ohio, as he is for the most part in  northeastern Kansas, yet I never heard his song in the former state,  while in the latter "]]]
