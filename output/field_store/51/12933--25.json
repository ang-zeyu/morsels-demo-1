The family of bird lice is a very extensive one, embracing many genera,  and several hundred species. One or more species infest the skin of all  our domestic and wild mammals and birds, some birds sheltering beneath  their feathers four or five species of lice. Before giving a hasty  account of some of our more common species; we will give a sketch of the  embryological history of the lice, with special reference to the  structure of the mouth parts.    [Illustration: 114. Embryo of the Louse.]    [Illustration: 115. Mouth Parts of the Louse.]    The eggs (Fig. 114, egg of the head louse) are long, oval, somewhat  pear-shaped, with the hinder end somewhat pointed, while the anterior  end is flattened, and bears little conical micropyles (_m_, minute  orifices for the passage of the spermatozoa into the egg), which vary in  form in the different species and genera; the opposite end of the egg is  provided with a few bristles. The female attaches her eggs to the hairs  or feathers of her host.    [Illustration: 116. Mouth Parts of the Louse.]    [Illustration: 118. Mouth Parts of Louse.]    [Illustration: 117. Mouth Parts of Louse.]    After the egg has been fertilized by the male, the blastoderm, or  primitive skin, forms, and subsequently two layers, or embryonal  membranes, appear; the outer is called the amnion (Fig. 114, _am_),  while the inner visceral membrane (_db_) partially wraps the rude form  of the embryo in its folds. The head (_vk_) of the embryo is now  directed towards the end of the egg on which the hairs are situated;  afterwards the embryo revolves on its axis and the head lies next to the  opposite end of the egg. Eight tubercles bud out from the under side of  the head, of which the foremost and longest are the antennae (_as_),  those succeeding are the mandibles, maxillae, and second maxillae, or  labium. Behind them arise six long, slender tubercles forming the legs,  and the primitive streak rudely marks the lower wall of the thorax and  abdomen not yet formed. Figure 115 represents the head and mouth parts  of the embryo of the same louse; _vk_ is the forehead, or clypeus;  _ant_, the antennae; _mad_, the mandibles; _max_1, the  first pair of maxillae, and _max_^2, the second pair  of maxillae, or labium. Figure 116 represents the mouth parts of the  same insect a little farther advanced, with the jaws and labium  elongated and closely folded together. Figure 117 represents the same  still farther advanced; the mandibles (_mad_) are sharp, and resemble  the jaws of the Mallophaga; and the maxillae (_max_^1) and labium  (_max_^2) are still large, while afterwards the labium becomes nearly  obsolete. Figure 118 represents a front view of the mouth parts of a  bird louse, Goniodes; _lb_, is the upper lip, or labrum, lying under the  clypeus; _mad_, the mandibles; max, the maxillae; _l_, the lyre-formed  piece; and _pl_, the \"plate.\"    [Illustration: 119. Louse of Cow.]    We will now describe some of the common species of lice found on a few  of our domestic animals, and the mallophagous parasites occurring on  certain mammals and birds. The family Pediculina, or true lice, is  higher than the bird lice, their mouth parts, as well as the structure  of the head, resembling the true Hemiptera, especially the bed bug. The  clypeus, or front of the head, is much smaller than in the bird lice,  the latter retaining the enlarged forehead of the embryo, it being in  some species half as large as the rest of the head.    All of our domestic mammals and birds are plagued by one or more species  of lice. Figure 119 represents the Haematopinus vituli, which is brownish  in color. As the specimen figured came from the Burnett collection of  the Boston Society of Natural History, together with those of the goat  louse, the louse of the common fowl, and of the cat, they are  undoubtedly naturalized here. Quite a different species is the louse of  the hog (H. suis, Fig. 120).    [Illustration: 120. Louse of Hog.]    The remaining parasites belong to the skin-biting lice, or Mallophaga,  and I will speak of the several genera referred to in their natural  order, beginning with the highest form and that which is nearest allied  to Pediculus.    [Illustration: 121. Louse of Domestic Fowl.]    The common barn-yard fowl is infested by a louse that we have called  Goniocotes Burnettii (Fig. 121), in honor of the late Dr. W. I. Burnett,  a young and talented naturalist and physiologist, who paid more  attention than any one else in this country to the study of these  parasites, and made a large collection of them, now in the museum of the  Boston Society of Natural History. It differs from the G. hologaster of  Europe, which lives on the same bird, in the short second joint of the  antennae, which are also stouter; and in the long head, the clypeus being  much longer and more acutely rounded; while the head is less hollowed  out at the insertion of the antennae. The abdomen is oval, and one-half  as wide as long, with transverse, broad, irregular bands along the edges  of the segments. The mandibles are short and straight, two toothed. The  body is slightly yellowish, and variously streaked and banded with  pitchy black. The duck is infested by a remarkably slender form (Fig.  122, Philopterus squalidus). Figure 123 represents the louse of the cat,  and another species (Fig. 124) of the same genus (Trichodes) lives upon  the goat.    The most degraded genus is Gyropus. Mr. C. Cook has found Gyropus ovalis  of Europe abundant on the Guinea pig. A species is also found on the  porpoise; an interesting fact, as this is the only insect we know of  that lives parasitically on any marine animal.    [Illustration: 122. Duck Louse.]    The genus Goniodes (Fig. 125, G. stylifer, the turkey louse) is of great  interest from a morphological and developmental point of view, as the  antennae are described and figured by Denny as being \"in the males  cheliform (Fig. 126, _a_, male; _b_, female); the first joint being very  large and thick, the third considerably smaller, recurved towards the  first, and forming a claw, the fourth and fifth very small, arising  from the back of the third.\" He farther remarks, that \"the males of this  [which lives on the turkey] and all the other species of Goniodes, use  the first and third joints of the antennae with great facility, acting  the part of a finger and thumb.\" The antennae of the females are of the  ordinary form. This hand-like structure, is, so far as we know, without  a parallel among insects, the antennae of the Hemiptera being almost  uniformly filiform, and from two to nine-jointed. The design of this  structure is probably to enable the male to grasp its consort and also  perhaps to cling to the feathers, and thus give it a superiority over  the weaker sex in its advances towards courtship. Why is this advantage  possessed by the males of this genus alone? The world of insects, and of  animals generally abounds in such instances, though existing in other  organs, and the developmentist dimly perceives in such departures from a  normal type of structure, the origin of new generic forms, whether due  at first to a seemingly accidental variation, or, as in this instance,  perhaps, to long use as prehensile organs through successive generations  of lice having the antennae slightly diverging from the typical  condition, until the present form has been developed. Another generation  of naturalists will perhaps unanimously agree that the Creator has thus  worked through secondary laws, which many of the naturalists of the  present day are endeavoring, in a truly scientific and honest spirit of  inquiry, to discover.    [Illustration: 124. Louse of the Goat.]    [Illustration: 123. Louse of the Cat.]    In their claw or leg-like form these male antennae also repeat in the  head, the general form of the legs, whose prehensile and grasping  functions they assume. We have seen above that the appendages of the  head and thorax are alike in the embryo, and the present case is an  interesting example of the unity of type of the jointed appendages of  insects, and articulates generally.    [Illustration: 120. Antennae of Goniodes.]    Another point of interest in these degraded insects is, that the process  of degradation begins either late in the life of the embryo or during  the changes from the larval to the adult, or winged state. An instance  of the latter may be observed in the wingless female of the canker worm,  so different from the winged male; this difference is created after the  larval stage, for the caterpillars of both sexes are the same, so far as  we know. So with numerous other examples among the moths. In the louse,  the embryo, late in its life, resembles the embryos of other insects,  even Corixa, a member of a not remotely allied family. But just before  hatching the insect assumes its degraded louse physiognomy. The  developmentist would say that this process of degradation points to  causes acting upon the insect just before or immediately after birth,  inducing the retrogression and retardation of development, and would  consider it as an argument for the evolution of specific forms by causes  acting on the animal while battling with its fellows in the struggle for  existence, and perhaps consider that the metamorphoses of the animal  within the egg are due to a reflex action of the modes of life of the  ancestors of the animal on the embryos of its descendants.
