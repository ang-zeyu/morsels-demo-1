He said that there  was a dreadful fight, and there were so many of his enemies that he was  being beaten.\"    \"Oh--ah--yes,\" said the Colonel.  \"Your father and I had a great many  fights with his enemies when the Company sent me to help him with a  battery of horse artillery, and to drill his men.\"    \"Was that, father, when you drilled and formed your regiment of  cavalry?\"    \"Yes, boy, yes.  But never mind the fighting now.  That was in the old  days.  Go on with your dinner.\"    But Singh did not seem to heed his words, for he was sitting gazing  straight before him at the scar on his host's forehead; and laying down  his knife and fork he continued, in a rapt, dreamy way, \"And he said he  thought his last hour had come, for he and the few men who were  retreating with him had placed their backs against a steep piece of  cliff, and they were fighting for their lives, surrounded by hundreds of  the enemy.\"    \"My dear boy, you are letting your dinner get cold,\" said the Colonel,  in a petulant way.    \"Yes,\" continued Singh, \"and it was all just like a story out of a book.  I used to ask father to tell it to me, and when I did he used to smile  and make me kneel down before him with my hands on his knees.\"    \"But, my dear Singh,\" interposed the Colonel, who looked so annoyed and  worried that Glyn kicked his schoolfellow softly under the table, and  then coloured up.    \"Don't!\" cried Singh sharply; and then in his old dreamy tone, \"When he  told me I used to seem to see it all, with his fierce enemies in their  steel caps with the turbans round them, and the chain rings hanging  about their necks and their swords flashing in the air as they made cuts  at my father's brave friends; and first one fell bleeding, and then  another, till there were only about a dozen left, and my father the  Maharajah was telling his men that the time had come when they must make  one bold dash at their enemies, and die fighting as brave warriors  should.\"    \"Yes, yes, yes, yes!\" cried the Colonel querulously.  \"But that curry is  getting cold, my boy, and it won't be worth eating if it isn't hot.\"    \"Yes, I'll go on directly,\" continued Singh in the same imperturbable  manner, and he leaned his elbows now upon the table, placed his chin  upon his hands, and fixed his eyes upon the Colonel's scar.    \"I can see it all now so plainly,\" he said; and with a quick gesture his  host dropped his knife sharply in his plate and clapped his hand across  his forehead, while Glyn gave his schoolfellow another thrust--a soft  one this time--with his foot.    But Singh paid not the slightest heed to his companion's hint.  He only  leaned a little more forward to look now in the Colonel's eyes; and  laughing softly he continued:    \"That doesn't make any difference.  I can see it all just the same, and  I seem to hear the roar like thunder father spoke about.  He said it was  the trampling of horses and the shouting of men, and it was you tearing  over the plain from out of the valley, with all the men that you had  drilled and made into his brave regiment.  They swept over the ground  with a rush, charging into the midst of the enemy and cutting right and  left till they reached my father and his friends, when a terrible  slaughter went on for a few minutes before the enemy turned and fled,  pursued by your brave soldiers, who had left their leader wounded on the  ground.  Father said he had just strength enough to catch you in his  arms as you fell from your horse with that terrible gash across your  forehead.  That was how he said you saved his life and always became his  greatest friend.\"    The Colonel's lips had parted to check the narration again and again;  but he seemed fascinated by the strange look in the boy's eyes, and for  the time being it was as if the whole scene of many years before was  being enacted once again; while, to Glyn's astonishment, the boy slowly  rose from his seat, went round to the Colonel's side of the table, to  stand behind his chair till the waiter left the room, and then laying  one hand on the old warrior's shoulder, with the other he drew away that  which covered the big scar, and bending over him he said softly:    \"Father told me I was to try and grow up like you, who saved his life,  and that I was always to think of you as my second father when he was  gone.\"    As Singh ended he bent down gently, and softly and reverently kissed the  scar, while the Colonel closed his eyes and Glyn noticed that his lips  were quivering beneath the great moustache, which seemed to move  strangely as if it had been touched.    For a few moments then there was a deep silence, during which Singh  glided back to his seat, took up his knife and fork, and said, in quite  a changed tone of voice:    \"It always makes me think of that when I sit and look at you.  And it  comes back, sir, just like a dream.  My father the Maharajah told me I  was never to forget that story; and I never shall.\"    Just at that moment the door was opened, and the waiter entered bearing  another dish, while through the opening there came a burst of music as  if some band were playing a march.    \"Hah!\" cried the Colonel, speaking with quite a start, but with his  voice sounding husky and strange, and the words seeming forced as he  gave Singh a long and earnest look.  \"Why, surely that is not a military  band?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the waiter, as he proceeded to change the plates, two of  them having their contents hardly touched.  \"There's a wild-beast show  in the town, sir, in the field at the back,\" and as he spoke the man  looked sharply at the boys.    \"Oh,\" said the Colonel with a forced laugh.  \"Why, boys, is that where  your elephant came from?\"    And then the dinner went on, with the Colonel forcing himself into  questioning the boys about their adventure, and from that he brought up  the elephants in Dour, and chatted about tiger-shooting and the dangers  of the man-eaters in the jungle.  But all the time Glyn kept noting that  his father spoke as if he had been strangely moved, and that when he  turned his eyes upon Singh his face softened and his voice sounded more  gentle.    As they sat over the dessert, Singh asked him to tell them about one of  the other old fights that his father and the Colonel had been in.    \"Don't ask me, my boy,\" said the Colonel gently.  \"You can't understand  it perhaps.  When you grow as old as I am perhaps you will.  But I don't  know.  You like Glyn after a fashion, I suppose?\"    \"Like him?\" cried Singh half-fiercely.  \"Why, of course I do!\"    \"Ha!\" said the Colonel.  \"And Glyn likes you, I know; and no wonder--  brought up together as you were like brothers.  Well, my boy, I went out  to India not very much older than you two fellows are, as a cadet in the  Company's service, and somehow or other, being a reckless sort of a  fellow, I was sent into several of the engagements with some of the  chiefs, and was picked out at last, when I pretty well understood my  work, to go to your father's court as you said, my boy, with  half-a-dozen six-pounders and teams of the most dashing Arab horses in  the service.  Then, somehow, your father got to like me, and I liked  him, and then we did a lot of fighting together until he was fixed  securely upon his throne, and he never would hear of my leaving him  again.  But there, you know all about it.  He left you to me, Singh, to  make a man of you with Glyn here, and I hope to live to go back with you  both to Dour and see you safe in your rightful position and fight for  you if the need should ever come.  And some day I hope that you two boys  will have grown into two strong, true-hearted men, with the same  brotherly love between you as held your fathers fast.  And then--Oh,  hang that music!  The fellows can't play a bit.  Here, what do you say?  Shall we walk into the field and listen to them and see the show?  Your  elephant too?\"    \"No,\" said Singh softly.  \"Let's stop here and talk about Dour and my  father.  We don't often see you now, sir, and I should like that best.\"    \"To be sure, then, my dear boys, we will stop here.  I want you to do  what you like best.--But you, Glyn: what do you say?\"    \"I like to hear you talk, father, and to be with you as much as we can.\"    \"That's good, my boy.  Then, to begin with,\" cried the Colonel with a  chuckle, \"I'll just finish my lecture.  I was very nearly letting it  slip.\"    \"Oh, but, father,\" cried Glyn, \"I thought you had looked over all that.\"    \"I have, my boy; but you know I am not good at talking.  The Doctor  would have given you a splendid lecture on fighting.\"    \"He did,\" said Glyn drily, and the Colonel laughed.    \"I suppose he would, my boys; but since I saw you this morning something  occurred to me that I might have mentioned to you.  How much do you boys  know about Shakespeare?\"    \"Not much, father--neither of us, I am afraid.\"    \"Ah, well, I dare say it will come to you by-and-by; but there are some  words that Shakespeare put into the mouth of an old court official in  _Hamlet_, when he was bidding his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#19)"],[1," and that  wouldn't be nice.  Hist!  What's that?\"    \"Can't hear anything, Jem.\"    \"More can I.  Here, shake hands, lad, case I has a tumble.\"    \"Don't, don't risk it, Jem,\" whispered Don, clinging to his hand.    \"What!  After making the rope!  Oh, come, Mas' Don, where's your pluck?  Now then, I'm off; and when I'm down safe, I'll give three jerks at the  line, and then hold it steady.  Here goes--once to be ready, twice to be  steady, three times to be--off!\"    Don's heart felt in his mouth as his companion grasped the rope tightly,  and let himself glide down the steep tiled slope, till he reached the  edge over the gutter; and then, as he disappeared, dissolving--so it  seemed--into the gloom, Don's breath was held, and he felt a singular  pain at the chest.    He grasped the rope, though, as he sat astride at the lower edge of the  opening; and the loosely twisted hemp seemed to palpitate and quiver as  if it were one of Jem's muscles reaching to his hands.    Then all at once the rope became slack, as if the tension had been  removed, and Don turned faint with horror.    \"It's broken!\" he panted; and he strained over as far as he could  without falling to hear the dull thud of his companion's fall.    Thoughts fly fast, and in a moment of time Don had seen poor Jem lying  crushed below, picked up, and had borne the news to his little wife.  But before he had gone any further, the rope was drawn tight once more,  and as he held it, there came to thrill his nerves three distinct jerks.    \"It's all right!\" he panted; and grasped the rope with both hands.  \"Now  then,\" he thought, \"it only wants a little courage, and I can slide down  and join him, and then we're free.\"    Yes; but it required a good deal of resolution to make the venture.  \"Suppose Jem's weight had unwound the rope; suppose it should break;  suppose--\"    \"Oh, what a coward I am!\" he muttered; and swinging his leg free, he lay  upon his face for a moment, right upon the sloping tiles and then let  the rope glide through his hands.    It was very easy work down that slope, only that elbows and hands  suffered, and sundry sounds suggested that waistcoat buttons were being  torn off.  But that was no moment for studying trifles; and what were  waistcoat buttons to liberty?    Another moment, and his legs were over the edge, and he was about to  attempt the most difficult part of the descent, grasping beforehand,  that as soon as he hung clear of the eaves, he should begin to turn  slowly round.    \"Now for it,\" he said; and he was about to descend perpendicularly, when  the rope was suddenly jerked violently.    There was a loud ejaculation, and Jem's voice rose to where he hung.    \"No, no, Mas' Don.  Back!  Back!  Don't come down.\"  Then, as he hung,  there came the panting and noise of a terrible struggle far below.        CHAPTER SIXTEEN.    PRISONERS AGAIN.    Don's grasp tightened on the rope, and as he lay there, half on, half  off the slope, listening, with the beads of perspiration gathering on  his forehead, he heard from below shouts, the trampling of feet and  struggling.    \"They've attacked Jem,\" he thought.  \"What shall I do?  Go to his help?\"    Before he could come to a decision the noise ceased and all was  perfectly still.    Don hung there thinking.    What should he do--slide down and try to escape, or climb back?    Jem was evidently retaken, and to escape would be cowardly, he thought;  and in this spirit he began to draw himself slowly back till, after a  great deal of exertion, he had contrived to get his legs beyond the  eaves, and there he rested, hesitating once more.    Just then he heard voices below, and holding on by one hand, he rapidly  drew up a few yards of the rope, making his leg take the place of  another hand.    There was a good deal of talking, and he caught the word \"rope,\" but  that was all.  So he continued his toilsome ascent till he was able to  grasp the edge of the skylight opening, up to which he dragged himself,  and sat listening, astride, as he had been before the attempt was made.    All was so still that he was tempted to slide down and escape for no  sound suggested that any one was on the watch.  But Jem!  Poor Jem!  It  was like leaving him in the lurch.    Still, he thought, if he did get away, he might give the alarm, and find  help to save Jem from being taken away.    \"And if they came up and found me gone,\" he muttered, \"they would take  Jem off aboard ship directly, and it would be labour in vain.\"    \"Oh!  Let go!\"    The words escaped him involuntarily, for whilst he was pondering, some  one had crept into the great loft floor, made a leap, and caught him by  the leg, and, in spite of all his efforts to free himself, the man hung  on till, unable to kick free, Don was literally dragged in and fell,  after clinging for a moment to the cross-beam, heavily upon the floor.    \"I've got him!\" cried a hoarse voice, which he recognised.  \"Look sharp  with the light.\"    Don was on his back half stunned and hurt, and his captor, the  sinister-looking man, was sitting upon his chest, half suffocating him,  and evidently taking no little pleasure in inflicting pain.    Footsteps were hurriedly ascending; then there was the glow of a  lanthorn, and directly after the bluff-looking man appeared, followed by  a couple of sailors, one of whom bore the light.  \"Got him?\"    \"Ay, ay!  I've got him, sir.\"    \"That's right!  But do you want to break the poor boy's ribs?  Get off!\"    Don's friend, the sinister-looking man, rose grumblingly from his  captive's chest, and the bluff man laughed.    \"Pretty well done, my lad,\" he said.  \"I might have known you two  weren't so quiet for nothing.  There, cast off that rope, and bring him  down.\"    The sinister man gripped Don's arm savagely, causing him intense pain,  but the lad uttered no cry, and suffered himself to be led down in  silence to floor after floor, till they were once more in the basement.    \"Might have broken your neck, you foolish boy,\" said the bluff man, as a  rough door was opened.  \"You can stop here for a bit.  Don't try any  more games.\"    He gave Don a friendly push, and the boy stepped forward once more into  a dark cellar, where he remained despairing and motionless as the door  was banged behind him, and locked; and then, as the steps died away, he  heard a groan.    \"Any one there?\" said a faint voice, followed by the muttered  words,--\"Poor Mas' Don.  What will my Sally do?  What will she do?\"    \"Jem, I'm here,\" said Don huskily; and there was a rustling sound in the  far part of the dark place.    \"Oh!  You there, Mas' Don?  I thought you'd got away.\"    \"How could I get away when they had caught you?\" said Don,  reproachfully.    \"Slid down and run.  There was no one there to stop you.  Why, I says to  myself when they pounced on me, if I gives 'em all their work to do,  they'll be so busy that they won't see Mas' Don, and he'll be able to  get right away.  Why didn't you slither and go?\"    \"Because I should have been leaving you in the lurch, Jem; and I didn't  want to do that.\"    \"Well, I--well, of all--there!--why, Mas' Don, did you feel that way?\"    \"Of course I did.\"    \"And you wouldn't get away because I couldn't?\"    \"That's what I thought, Jem.\"    \"Well, of all the things I ever heared!  Now I wonder whether I should  have done like that if you and me had been twisted round; I mean, if you  had gone down first and been caught.\"    \"Of course you would, Jem.\"    \"Well, that's what I don't know, Mas' Don.  I'm afraid I should have  waited till they'd got off with you, and slipped down and run off.\"    \"I don't think you'd have left me, Jem.\"    \"I dunno, my lad.  I should have said to myself, I can bring them as 'ud  help get Mas' Don out; and gone.\"    Don thought of his own feelings, and remained silent.    \"I say, Mas' Don, though, it's a bad job being caught; but the rope was  made strong enough, warn't it?\"    \"Yes, but it was labour in vain.\"    \"Well, p'r'aps it was, sir; but I'm proud of that rope all the same.  Oh!\"    Jem uttered a dismal groan.    \"Are you hurt, Jem?\"    \"Hurt, sir!  I just am hurt--horrible.  'Member when I fell down and the  tub went over me?\"    \"And broke your ribs, and we thought you were dead?  Yes, I remember.\"    \"Well, I feel just the same as I did then.  I went down and a lot of 'em  fell on me, and I was kicked and jumped on till I'm just as if all the  hoops was off my staves, Mas' Don; but that arn't the worst of it,  because it won't hurt me.  I'm a reg'lar wunner to mend again.  You  never knew any one who got cut as could heal up as fast as me.  See how  strong my ribs grew together, and so did my leg when I got kicked by  that horse.\"    \"But are you in much pain now?\"    \"I should just think I am, Mas' Don; I feel as if I was being cut up  with blunt saws as had been made red hot first.\"    \"Jem, my poor fellow!\" groaned Don.    \"Now don't go on like that, Mas' Don, and make it worse.\"    \"Would they give us a candle, Jem, do you think, if I was to knock?\"    \"Not they, my lad; and I don't want one.  You'd be seeing how queer I  looked if you got a light.  There, sit down and let's talk.\"    Don groped along by the damp wall till he reached the place where his  companion lay, and then went down on his knees beside him.    \"It seems to be all over, Jem,\" he said.    \"Over?  Not it, my lad.  Seems to me as if it's all just going to  begin.\"    \"Then we shall be made sailors.\"    \"S'pose so, Mas' Don.  Well, I don't know as I should so much mind if it  warn't for my Sally.  A man might just as well be pulling ropes as  pushing casks and winding cranes.\"    \"But we shall have to fight, Jem.\"    \"Well, so long as it's fisties I don't know as I much mind, but if they  expect me to chop or shoot anybody, they're mistook.\"    Jem became silent, and for a long time his fellow-prisoner felt not the  slightest inclination to speak.  His thoughts were busy over"]]]
