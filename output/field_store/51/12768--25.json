But, because  she who spinneth day and night[4] had not for him yet drawn the  distaff off, which Clotho loads for each one and compacts, his  soul, which is thy sister and mine, coming upwards could not  come alone, because it sees not after our fashion. Wherefore I  was drawn from out the ample throat of Hell to show him, and I  shall show him so far on as my teaching can lead him. But tell  us, if thou knowest, why just now the mountain gave such shocks,  and why all seemed to cry together, even down to its moist feet.\"  Thus asking he shot for me through the needle's eye of my desire,  so that only with the hope my thirst became less craving.    [1] \"According to that buoyant and immortal sentence with which  Aristotle begins his Metaphysics, 'All mankind naturally desire  knowledge.'\" Matthew Arnold, God and the Bible, cli. iv. This  sentence of Aristotle is cited by Dante in the first chapter of  the Convito.    [2] The living water of truth.    [3] To the salutation, \"Peace be with you,\" the due answer is,  \"And with thy spirit.\"    [4] Lachesis.      The shade began: \"There is nothing which without order the  religion of the mountain can feel, or which can be outside its  wont.[1] Free is this place from every alteration; of that which  heaven receives from itself within itself there may be effect  here, but of naught else;[2] because nor rain, nor hail, nor  snow, nor dew, nor frost, falls higher up than the little  stairway of the three short steps; clouds appear not, or thick or  thin; nor lightning, nor the daughter of Thaumas[3] who yonder  often changes her quarter; dry vapor[4] rises not farther up than  the top of the three steps of which I spoke, where the vicar of  Peter has his feet. It trembles perhaps lower down little or  much; but up here it never trembles because of wind that is  hidden, I know not how, in the earth. It trembles here when some  soul feels itself pure, so that it rises or moves to ascend; and  such a cry seconds it. Of the purity the will alone makes proof,  which surprises the soul, wholly free to change its company, and  helps it with the will. The soul wills at first indeed, but the  inclination,--which, contrary to the will, Divine Justice sets to  the torment, as erst to the sin,--allows it not.[5] And I who  have lain in this pain five hundred years and more, only just now  felt a free volition for a better seat. Wherefore thou didst feel  the earthquake, and hear the pious spirits through the Mountain  giving praise to that Lord, who--may He speed them upward soon!\"    [1] The religion, the sacred rule, of the Mountain admits nothing  that is not ordained and customary.    [2] Whatever happens here is occasioned only by the direct  influences of the heavens.    [3] Iris = the rainbow, seen now to the west, now to the east.    [4] Dry vapor, according to Aristotle, was the source of wind and  of earthquake.    [5] Until the soul is wholly purified from its sinful  disposition,it desires the punishment through; which its  purification is accomplished, as it had originally desired the  object of its sin. But when it becomes pure, then the will  possesses it to mount to Heaven, and becomes effective.      Thus he said to us, and since one enjoys drinking in proportion  as the thirst is great, I could not say how much he did me good.  And the sage Leader, \"Now I see the net which snares you here,  and how it is unmeshed; wherefore it trembles here; and for what  ye rejoice together. Now who thou wast may it please thee that I  know, and that from thy words I learn why for so many centuries  thou hast lain here?\" \"At the time when the good Titus, with the  aid of the Most High King, avenged the wounds wherefrom issued  the blood sold by Judas, I was fatuous enough on earth with the  name which lasts longest, and honors most,\"[1] replied that  spirit, \"but not as yet with faith. So sweet was my vocal spirit,  that me of Toulouse Rome drew to itself, where I deserved to  adorn my temples with myrtle. Statius the people still on earth  name me. I sang of Thebes, and then of the great Achilles, but I  fell on the way with my second load.[2] Seed of my ardor were the  sparks that warmed me of the divine flame whereby more than a  thousand have been kindled; I speak of the Aeneid, which was  mother to me, and was my nurse in poesy: without it I balanced  not the weight of a drachm; and to have lived yonder, when Virgil  lived, I would agree to one sun more than I owe for my issue from  ban.\"[3]    [1] The name of Poet.    [2] Statius died before completing his Achilleid.    [3] A year more in Purgatory than is due for my punishment.      These words turned Virgil to me with a look which, silent, said,  \"Be silent:\" but the power that wills cannot do everything; for  smiles and tears are such followers on the emotion from which  each springs, that in the most truthful they least follow the  will. I merely smiled, like a man who makes a sign; whereat the  shade became silent, and looked at me in the eyes where the  expression is most fixed. And it said, \"So mayst thou in good  complete so great a labor, why aid thy face just now display to  me a flash of a smile?\" Now am I caught on one side and the  other: one bids me be silent, the other conjures me to speak;  wherefore I sigh and am understood by my Master, and \"Have no  fear to speak,\" he said to me, \"but speak, and tell him what he  asks so earnestly.\" Whereon I, \"Perhaps thou marvellest, ancient  spirit, at the smile I gave; but I would have more wonder seize  thee. This one who guides my eyes on high is that Virgil from  whom thou didst derive the strength to sing of men and of the  gods. If thou didst believe other cause for my smile, dismiss it  as untrue, and believe it to be those words which thou saidst of  him.\" Already he was stooping to embrace the feet of my Leader,  but he said to him, \"Brother, do it not, for thou art a shade,  and thou seest a shade.\" And he rising, \"Now canst thou  comprehend the sum of the love that warms me to thee when I  forget our vanity, treating the shades as if a solid thing.\"[1]    [1] Sordello and Virgil (Canto VI.) embraced each other. The  shades could thus express their mutual affection. Perhaps it is  out of modesty that Virgil here represses Statius, and possibly  there may be the under meaning that an act of reverence is not  becoming from a soul redeemed, to one banned in eternal exile.        CANTO XXII. Ascent to the Sixth Ledge.--Discourse of Statius and  Virgil.--Entrance to the Ledge: the Gluttonous.--The Mystic  Tree.--Examples of Temperance.      Already was the Angel left behind us,--the Angel who had turned  us to the sixth round,--having erased a stroke[1] from my face;  and he had said to us that those who have their desire set on  justice are Beati, and his words ended with sitiunt, without the  rest.[2] And I, more light than through the other passes, was  going on so that without any labor I was following upward the  swift spirits, when Virgil began, \"Love kindled by virtue always  kindles another, provided that its flame appear outwardly;  wherefore from the hour when amid us Juvenal descended into the  limbo of Hell, and made known to me thy affection, my own good  will toward thee was such that more never bound one to an unseen  person; so that these stairs will now seem short to me. But tell  me (and as a friend pardon me, if too great confidence let loose  my rein, and as a friend now talk with me) boxy avarice could  find a place within thy breast, amid wisdom so great as that  wherewith through thy diligence thou wast filled?\"    [1] The fifth P.    [2] The Angel had not recited all the words of the Beatitude, but  only, \"Blessed are they which do thirst after righteousness,\"  contrasting this thirst with the thirst for riches.      These words first moved Statius a little to smiling; then he  replied, \"Every word of thine is a dear sign to me of love. Truly  oftentimes things have such appearance that they give false  material for suspicion, because the true reasons lie hid. Thy  question assures me of thy belief, perhaps because of that circle  where I was, that I was avaricious in the other life; know then  that avarice was too far removed from me, and this want of  measure thousands of courses of the moon have punished. And had  it not been that I set right my care, when I understood the  passage where thou dost exclaim, as if indignant with human  nature, \"O cursed hunger of gold, to what dost thou not impel the  appetite of mortals?\"[1] I, rolling, should share the dismal  jousts.[2] Then I perceived that the bands could spread their  wings too much in spending; and I repented as well of that as of  my other sins. How many shall rise with cropped hair[3] through  ignorance, which during life and in the last hours prevents  repentance for this sin! And know, that the vice which rebuts any  sin with direct opposition,[4] together with it here dries up its  verdure. Wherefore if to purify myself I have been among the  people who lament their avarice, because of its contrary this has  befallen me.\" \"Now when thou wast singing[5]the cruel strife of  the twofold affliction[6] of Jocasta,\" said the Singer of the  Bucolic songs, \"it does not appear from that which Clio  touches[7] with thee there,[8] that the faith, without which good  works suffice not, had yet made thee faithful. If this be so,  what sun, or what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#19)"],[1,"lark that in the air expatiates first singing,  and then is silent, content with the last sweetness which  satisfies her, such seemed to me the image of the imprint of the  Eternal Plea, sure, according to whose desire everything becomes  that which it is.[1] And though I was there, in respect to my  doubt,[2] like glass to the color which cloaks it; it[3] endured  not to await the time in silence, but with the force of its own  weight urged from my mouth, \"What things are these?\" whereat I  saw great festival of sparkling. Thereupon, with its eye more  enkindled, the blessed ensign answered me , in order not to keep  me in wondering suspense: \"I see that thou believest these  things because I say them, but thou seest not how; so that,  although believed in, they are hidden. Thou dost as one who fully  apprehends a thing by name, but cannot see its quiddity unless  another explain it. Regnum coelorum[4] suffers violence from  fervent love, and from a living hope which vanquishes the divine  will; not in such wise as man overcomes man, but vanquishes it,  because it wills to be vanquished, and, vanquished, vanquishes  with its own benignity. The first life of the eyebrow and the  fifth make thee marvel, because thou seest the region of the  Angels painted with them. From their bodies they did not issue  Gentiles, as thou believest, but Christians, in firm faith, one  in the Feet that were to suffer, one in the Feet that had  suffered.[5] For the one from Hell, where there is never return  to righteous will, came back to his bones; and that was the  reward of living hope; of living hope, which put its power in  prayers made to God to raise him up, so that it might be possible  his will should be moved.[6] The glorious soul, whereof I speak,  returning to the flesh, in which it remained short while,  believed in Him who was able to aid it; and in believing was  kindled to such fire of true love, that at the second death it  was worthy to come to this sport. The other, through grace which  distils from a fount so deep that creature never pushed the eye  far as its primal wave, there below set all his love on  righteousness; wherefore from grace to grace God opened his eye  to our future redemption, so that he believed in it, and  thenceforth endured no more the stench of paganism,  and reproved therefor the perverse folk. More than a thousand  years before baptizing,[7] those three ladies whom thou sawest at  the right wheel[8] were to him for baptism. O predestination,  how remote is thy root from the sight of those who see not the  entire First Cause! And ye, mortals, keep yourselves restrained  in judging; for we who see God know not yet all the elect. And  unto us such want is sweet, for our good is perfected in this  good, that what God wills we also will.\"    [1] So, seemed the image (that is, the eagle), satiated with its  bliss, whether in the speech or the silence imposed upon it by  the Eternal Pleasure, in accordance with which all things fulfil  their ends.    [2] How Trajan and Rhipeus could be in Paradise, since none but  those who had believed in Christ were there.    [3] My doubt.    [4] The kingdom of Heaven.\"--Matthew, xi. 12.    [5] Rhipeus died before the coming of Christ; Trajan after.    [6] According to the legend, St. Gregory the Great prayed that  Trajan, because of his great worth, might be restored to life  long enough for his will to return to righteousness, and for him  to profess his faith in Christ.    [7] Before the divine institution of the rite of baptism his  faith, hope, and charity served him in lieu thereof.    [8] Of the Chariot of the Church. See Purgatory, Canto XXIX.      Thus, to make my short sight clear, sweet medicine was given to  me by that divine image. And as a good lutanist makes the  vibration of the string accompany a good singer, whereby the song  acquires more pleasantness, so it comes back to my mind that,  while it spake, I saw the two blessed lights moving their  flamelets to the words, just as the winking of the eyes concords.        CANTO XXI. Ascent to the Heaven of Saturn.--Spirits of those who  had given themselves to devout contemplation.--The Golden  Stairway.--St. Peter Damian.--Predestination.--The luxury of  modern Prelates.    Now were my eyes fixed again upon the countenance of my Lady, and  my mind with them, and from every other intent it was withdrawn;  and she was not smiling, but, \"If I should smile,\" she began to  me, \"thou wouldst become such as Semele was when she became  ashes; for my beauty, which along the stairs of the eternal  palace is kindled the more, as thou hast seen, the higher it  ascends, is so resplendent that, if it were not tempered, at its  effulgence thy mortal power would be as a bough shattered by  thunder. We are lifted to the seventh splendor which beneath the  breast of the burning Lion now radiates downward mingled with his  strength.[1] Fix thy mind behind thine eyes, and make of them  mirrors for the shape which in this mirror shall be apparent to  thee.\"    [1] The seventh splendor is Saturn, which was in the sign of the  Lion, whence its rays fell to earth, mingled with the strong  influences of the sign.      He who should know what was the pasture of my sight in her  blessed aspect, when I transferred me to another care, would  recognize, by counterposing one side with the other, how pleasing  it was to me to obey my celestial escort.    Within the crystal which, circling round the world, bears the  name of its shining leader, under whom all wickedness lay  dead,[1] I saw, of the color of gold through which a sunbeam is  shining,[2] a stairway rising up so high that my eye followed it  not. I saw, moreover, so many splendors descending, along the  steps, that I thought every light which appears in heaven was  there diffused.    [1] Saturn, in the golden age.    [2] As in a painted window.      And as, according to their natural custom, the rooks, at the  beginning of the day, move about together, in order to warm their  cold feathers; then some go away without return, others wheel  round to whence they had set forth, and others, circling, make a  stay; such fashion it seemed to me was here in that sparkling  which came together, so soon as it struck on a certain step; and  that which stopped nearest to us became so bright that I said in  my thought, \"I clearly see the love which thou signifiest to me.  But she, from whom I await the how and the when of speech and of  silence, stays still; wherefore I, contrary to desire, do well  that I ask not.\" Whereupon she, who saw my silence, in the sight  of Him who sees everything, said to me, \"Let loose thy warm  desire.\"    And I began, \"My own merit makes me not worthy of thy answer; but  for her sake who concedes to me the asking, O blessed life, that  keepest thyself hidden within thine own joy, make known to me the  cause which has placed thee so near me; and tell why in this  wheel the sweet symphony of Paradise is silent, which below  through the others so devoutly sounds.\" \"Thou hast thy hearing  mortal, as thy sight,\" it replied to me; \"therefore no song is  here for the same reason that Beatrice has no smile. Down along  the steps of the holy stairway I have thus far descended, only to  give thee glad welcome with my speech and with the light that  mantles me; nor has more love made me to be more ready, for as  much and more love is burning here above, even as the flaming  manifests to thee; but the high charity, which makes us ready  servants to the counsel that governs the world, allots here,[1]  even as thou observest.\" \"I see well,\" said I, \"O sacred lamp,  how the free will of love suffices in this Court for following  the eternal Providence. But this is what seems to me hard to  discern, why thou alone wert predestined to this office among thy  consorts.\" I had not come to the last word before the light made  a centre of its middle, whirling like a swift milestone. Then the  love that was within it answered, \"A divine light strikes upon  me, penetrating through this wherein I embosom me: the virtue of  which, conjoined with my vision, lifts me above myself so far  that I see the Supreme Essence from which it emanates. Thence  comes the joy wherewith I flame, because to my vision, in  proportion as it is clear, I match the clearness of my flame. But  that soul in Heaven which is most enlightened,[2] that Seraph who  has his eye most fixed on God, could not satisfy thy demand;  because that which thou askest lies so deep within the abyss of  the eternal statute, that from every created sight it is cut off.  And when thou retumest to the mortal world, carry this back, so  that it may no more presume to move its feet toward such a goal.  The mind which shines here, on earth is smoky; wherefore consider  how there below it can do that which it cannot do though Heaven  assume it.\"    [1] Assigns its part to each spirit.    [2] With the Divine light.      So did its words prescribe to me, that I left the question, and  drew me back to ask it humbly who it was. \"Between the two  shores of Italy, and not very distant from thy native land, rise  rocks so lofty that the thunders sound far lower down,  and they make a height which is called Catria, beneath which a  hermitage is consecrated which is wont to be devoted to worship  only.\"[1] Thus it began again to me with its third speech, and  then, continuing, it said, \"Here in the service of God I became  so steadfast, that, with food of olive juice alone, lightly I  used to pass the heats and frosts, content in contemplative  thoughts. That cloister was wont to render in abundance to these  heavens; and now it is become so empty as needs must soon be  revealed. In that place I was Peter Damian,[2] and Peter a sinner  had I been in the house of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.[3]  Little of mortal life was remaining for me, when I was sought for  and dragged to that hat[4] which ever is passed down from"]]]
