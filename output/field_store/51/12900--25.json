When the note was handed to him, Lincoln said:    \"All right, wait a minute,\" and the game soon ended amid peals of  laughter. Then the young lawyer jumped into the buggy. On the way back  Mr. Lincoln told his companion such funny stories that the young man,  convulsed with laughter, was unable to drive. The horse, badly broken,  upset them into a ditch, smashing the vehicle.    \"You stay behind and look after the buggy,\" said the lawyer. \"I'll walk  on.\"    He came, with long strides, into the court room just in time for the  trial and won the case for the wagonmaker.    \"What am I to pay you?\" asked the client delighted.    \"I hope you won't think ten or fifteen dollars too much,\" said the young  attorney, \"and I'll pay half the hire of the buggy and half the cost of  repairing it.\"      LAWYER LINCOLN AND MARY OWENS    About the time Mr. Lincoln was admitted to the bar, Miss Mary Owens, a  bright and beautiful young woman from Kentucky, came to visit her  married sister near New Salem. The sister had boasted that she was going  to \"make a match\" between her sister and Lawyer Lincoln. The newly  admitted attorney smiled indulgently at all this banter until he began  to consider himself under obligations to marry Miss Owens if that young  lady proved willing.    After he went to live in Springfield, with no home but his office, he  wrote the young lady a long, discouraging letter, of which this is a  part:              \"I am thinking of what we said about your          coming to live in Springfield. I am afraid you          would not be satisfied. There is a great deal          of flourishing about in carriages here, which          it would be your doom to see without sharing          it. You would have to be poor without the means          of hiding your poverty. Do you believe that you          could bear that patiently? Whatever woman may          cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so,          it is my intention to do all in my power to          make her happy and contented, and there is          nothing I can imagine that could make me more          unhappy than to fail in that effort. I know I          should be much happier with you than the way I          am, provided I saw no sign of discontent in          you.            \"I much wish you would think seriously before          you decide. What I have said, I will most          positively abide by, provided you wish it. You          have not been accustomed to hardship, and it          may be more severe than you now imagine. I know          you are capable of thinking correctly on any          subject, and if you deliberate maturely upon          this before you decide, then I am willing to          abide by your decision.                                     \"Yours, etc.,                                              \"LINCOLN.\"    For a love letter this was nearly as cold and formal as a legal  document. Miss Owens could see well enough that Lawyer Lincoln was not  much in love with her, and she let him know, as kindly as she could,  that she was not disposed to cast her lot for life with an enforced  lover, as he had proved himself to be. She afterward confided to a  friend that \"Mr. Lincoln was deficient in those little links which make  up the chain of a woman's happiness.\"      THE EARLY RIVALRY BETWEEN LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS    Soon after Mr. Lincoln came to Springfield he met Stephen A. Douglas, a  brilliant little man from Vermont. The two seemed naturally to take  opposing sides of every question. They were opposite in every way.  Lincoln was tall, angular and awkward. Douglas was small, round and  graceful--he came to be known as \"the Little Giant.\" Douglas was a  Democrat and favored slavery. Lincoln was a Whig, and strongly opposed  that dark institution. Even in petty discussions in Speed's store, the  two men seemed to gravitate to opposite sides. A little later they were  rivals for the hand of the same young woman.    One night, in a convivial company, Mr. Douglas's attention was directed  to the fact that Mr. Lincoln neither smoked nor drank. Considering this  a reflection upon his own habits, the little man sneered:    \"What, Mr. Lincoln, are you a temperance man?\"    \"No,\" replied Lincoln with a smile full of meaning, \"I'm not exactly a  temperance man, but I am temperate in this, to wit:--I _don't drink_!\"    In spite of this remark, Mr. Lincoln _was_ an ardent temperance man. One  Washington's birthday he delivered a temperance address before the  Washingtonian Society of Springfield, on \"Charity in Temperance Reform,\"  in which he made a strong comparison between the drink habit and black  slavery.      LOGAN & LINCOLN    In 1841 the partnership between Stuart and Lincoln was dissolved and the  younger man became a member of the firm of Logan & Lincoln. This was  considered a long step in advance for the young lawyer, as Judge Stephen  T. Logan was known as one of the leading lawyers in the State. From  this senior partner he learned to make the thorough study of his cases  that characterized his work throughout his later career.    While in partnership with Logan, Mr. Lincoln was helping a young fellow  named \"Billy\" Herndon, a clerk in his friend Speed's store, advising him  in his law studies and promising to give the youth a place in his own  office as soon as young Herndon should be fitted to fill it.      WHAT LINCOLN DID WITH HIS FIRST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE    During the interim between two partnerships, after he had left Major  Stuart, and before he went into the office with Logan, Mr. Lincoln  conducted a case alone. He worked very hard and made a brilliant success  of it, winning the verdict and a five hundred dollar fee. When an old  lawyer friend called on him, Lincoln had the money spread out on the  table counting it over.    \"Look here, judge,\" said the young lawyer. \"See what a heap of money  I've got from that case. Did you ever see anything like it? Why, I never  in my life had so much money all at once!\"    Then his manner changed, and crossing his long arms on the table he  said:    \"I have got just five hundred dollars; if it were only seven hundred and  fifty I would go and buy a quarter section (160 acres) of land and give  it to my old stepmother.\"    The friend offered to lend him the two hundred and fifty dollars needed.  While drawing up the necessary papers, the old judge gave the young  lawyer this advice:    \"Lincoln, I wouldn't do it quite that way. Your stepmother is getting  old, and, in all probability, will not live many years. I would settle  the property upon her for use during her lifetime, to revert to you upon  her death.\"    \"I shall do no such thing,\" Lincoln replied with deep feeling. \"It is a  poor return, at best, for all the good woman's devotion to me, and there  is not going to be any half-way business about it.\"    The dutiful stepson did as he planned. Some years later he was obliged  to write to John Johnston, his stepmother's son, appealing to him not to  try to induce his mother to sell the land lest the old woman should lose  the support he had provided for her in her declining years.      IN LOVE WITH A BELLE FROM LEXINGTON    Lincoln's popularity in Sangamon County, always increasing, was greatly  strengthened by the part he had taken in the removal of the capital to  Springfield, which was the county seat as well as the State capital. So  he was returned to the Legislature, now held in Springfield, time after  time, without further effort on his part. He was looked upon as a young  man with a great future. While he was in the office with Major Stuart  that gentleman's cousin, Miss Mary Todd, a witty, accomplished young  lady from Lexington, Kentucky, came to Springfield to visit her sister,  wife of Ninian W. Edwards, one of the \"Long Nine\" in the State Assembly.    Miss Todd was brilliant and gay, a society girl--in every way the  opposite of Mr. Lincoln--and he was charmed with everything she said and  did. Judge Douglas was one of her numerous admirers, and it is said that  the Louisville belle was so flattered by his attentions that she was in  doubt, for a time, which suitor to accept. She was an ambitious young  woman, having boasted from girlhood that she would one day be mistress  of the White House.    To all appearances Douglas was the more likely to fulfill Miss Todd's  high ambition. He was a society man, witty in conversation, popular with  women as well as with men, and had been to Congress, so he had a  national reputation, while Lincoln's was only local, or at most confined  to Sangamon County and the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Illinois.    But Mr. Douglas was already addicted to drink, and Miss Todd saw  doubtless that he could not go on long at the rapid pace he was keeping  up. It is often said that she was in favor of slavery, as some of her  relatives who owned slaves, years later, entered the Confederate ranks  to fight against the Union. But the remarkable fact that she finally  chose Lincoln shows that her sympathies were against slavery, and she  thus cut herself off from several members of her own family. With a  woman's intuition she saw the true worth of Abraham Lincoln, and before  long they were understood to be engaged.    But the young lawyer, after his recent experience with Mary Owens,  distrusted his ability to make any woman happy--much less the belle from  Louisville, so brilliant, vivacious, well educated and exacting. He  seemed to grow morbidly conscious of his shortcomings, and she was  high-strung. A misunderstanding arose, and, between such exceptional  natures, \"the course of true love never did run smooth.\"    Their engagement, if they were actually betrothed, was broken, and the  lawyer-lover was plunged in deep melancholy. He wrote long, morbid  letters to his friend Speed, who had returned to Kentucky, and had  recently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#19)"],[1,"19th April, by which time  the trails would be already breaking up. Counting out Sundays, that left  forty-eight days of travelling with something like twelve hundred miles  yet to make without going to Point Hope--an average of about twenty-five  miles a day. I knew that we had made no such average in the distance  already covered, and though I knew also that travelling improved  generally as the season advanced, I did not know how very much better  going there is on the wind-hardened snows of the coast when travelling  is possible at all. Again and again I have regretted that I did not take  the chance and push on, but at the time I decided as I thought I ought  to decide, and one has no real compunctions when that is the case.    [Sidenote: THE RESOLUTION TO TURN SOUTH]    So a first-hand knowledge of our own most interesting work among the  Esquimaux was not for me on that occasion--and there has arisen no  opportunity since. Mr. Knapp, who had planned to spend the rest of the  winter at Point Hope, would get a guide and a team here and turn north  after some days' rest, while I would turn south. Roxy was impatient to  return to Bettles. \"Me no likee this country,\" was all that could be got  out of him. So I paid him his money and made him a present of the .22  repeating rifle with which he had killed so many ptarmigan on the  journey, outfitted him with clothes, grub, and ammunition, and let him  go; saying good-bye with regret, for he was a good boy to us all the  way.    It was late on the night of our single day of rest when I got to bed,  for there had been squaring up of accounts and much writing, and when I  went to bed I did not sleep. Again and again I reviewed the decision I  had come to and fought against it, though such is far from my common  habit. Even as I write, years after, the bitter rebellious reluctance  with which I turned south comes back to me. I wished the hospital at  Fairbanks at the bottom of the deep blue sea. I protested I would go on  and complete my journey, even though it involved \"thawing out\" at Tanana  and getting to Fairbanks on a steamboat in the summer. I had a free  hand, a kindly and complaisant bishop, and none would call me strictly  to account. Then I realised that it was merely pride of purpose,  self-willed resolution of accomplishing what had been essayed--in a  word, personal gratification for which I was fighting, and with that  realisation came surrender and sleep.          CHAPTER IV    THE SEWARD PENINSULA--CANDLE CREEK, COUNCIL, AND NOME      ONE day's rest was not a great deal after the distance we had come--and  that day fully occupied with business--but since Point Hope was  abandoned some sort of schedule must be made for the Seward Peninsula,  and where Sunday shall be spent is always an important factor in  arranging these itineraries. There was just time to reach Candle for the  next Sunday and it was decided to attempt it. Hans would accompany me as  far as Candle, where he hoped to find work. It meant two days of  forty-five miles each, for it is ninety miles from Kikitaruk to Candle,  but they told us it could be done.    So the reluctant adieus made, letters despatched, some mailed here at  Kikitaruk, some to be carried back to Bettles and mailed there--these  latter getting outside long before the former--we started at seven in  the morning instead of six, as we had planned, on the journey down the  shore of Kotzebue Sound. That hour's delay turned out to be a calamity  for us.    The trail was smooth along the beach until Cape Blossom was reached, and  I had the first riding of the winter, Hans and I alternately running and  jumping on the sled. There was a portage across the cape, and three or  four miles below it was the wreck of the river steamer _Riley_, which  used to make a voyage up the Kobuk with supplies for the miners at the  Shungnak. The thermometer was at -38 deg. when we started, and the same  light but keen breeze was blowing that had annoyed us on the other side  of the peninsula. What a barren, desolate region it is!--low rocks  sinking away to the dead level of the snow-field on the one hand,  nothing but the ice-field on the other.    [Sidenote: A BAD NIGHT]    [Sidenote: CAMPED IN THE OPEN]    We were bound for an igloo forty-five miles from the mission, the only  shelter between Kikitaruk on the peninsula and Kewalik on the mainland,  and we had been warned that the igloo would be easy to miss if it grew  dark as it would be almost indistinguishable from the snow-drifts of the  shore. Some directions from a multitude of counsellors remembered in one  sense by Hans and in another by me, added to our uncertainty as to just  where the igloo lay. The wind increased in force as the evening advanced  and the last time I looked at the thermometer it still registered -38 deg..  The sun set over the sound with another of those curious distortions  which had before proved ominous to us. It was flattened and swollen out  like a pot-bellied Chinese lantern, with a neck to it and an irregular  veining over its surface that completed the resemblance. The wind  increased until the air was full of flying snow and it grew dark, and  still there was no sign of the igloo. Only slowly and with much  difficulty could the trail be followed, and that meant we were soon not  moving fast enough to keep warm in the fierce wind. At last we lost the  trail altogether, and sometimes we found ourselves out on the rough ice  of the sound and sometimes wallowing in a fresh snow-drift on the shore.  I became possessed with the fear that we had passed the igloo. I was  positive that we were told at the mission that we should reach it  _before_ the high bluffs were passed, and we had passed them a long way  and had now but a shallow shelf to mark the coast-line. It is strange  how long that delusion about passing his destination will pursue the  Alaskan traveller. Presently the dogs dropped off a steep bank in the  dark, and only by good fortune we were able to keep the heavy sled from  falling upon them, for they were dead tired and lay where they dropped.  With freezing fingers I unhitched the dogs while Hans held the sled, and  we lowered it safely down. But it was plain that it was dangerous to  proceed. We could not find the trail again and were growing alarmingly  cold. We were \"up against it,\" as they say here, \"up against it good and  strong.\" We had a tent but no means of putting it up, a stove but  nothing to burn in it, a grub box full of food but no way to cook it. So  the first night of coast travel was to show us the full rigour and  inhospitality of the coast and to make us long for the interior again.  Wood can almost always be found there within a few miles, if it be not  immediately at hand, and no one properly appreciates the hospitality of  a clump of spruce-trees until he has spent a night of storm lying out on  this barren coast. We turned the dogs loose and threw them a fish  apiece, unlashed the sled, and got out our bedding. I had been sleeping  in robes, Hans in a shedding caribou-hide sleeping-bag that was my pet  aversion. When he crawled out in the morning he was so covered with hair  that he looked like a caribou, and the miserable hairs were always  getting into the food. We fished them out of the coffee, pulled them out  of the butter, and picked them out of the bread. But now in that  sleeping-bag he had an enormous advantage. We lay side by side on the  snow in the lee of the sled, and, tuck myself up with blanket and robe  as I would, it was impossible to keep the swirling snow from coming in.  I called the dogs to me and made them lie on my feet and up against my  side, and so long as they lay still I could get a little warmth, but  whenever they rose and left me I grew numb again. But Hans in his  sleeping-bag was snoring. The bag is the only bedding on the coast.  Added to the physical discomfort of that sleepless, shivery night was  some mental uneasiness. There was no telling to what height the storm  might rise, nor how long it might continue. Sometimes travellers  overtaken in this way on the coast have to lie in their sleeping-bags  for three days and nights before they can resume their journey. The only  interest the night held was the thought that came to me that as nearly  as I could tell we camped exactly on the Arctic Circle. The long night  dragged its slow length to the dawn at last and the wind moderated a  little at the same time, so with the first streak in the east I awoke  Hans, we gathered our poor dogs together, rolled up the snow-incrusted  bedding, and resumed our journey. Two miles farther on was the igloo!  Our calls awoke some one and we were bidden to enter. Descending a  ladder and crawling through a dark passage we came in to the grateful  warmth and shelter. The chamber was crowded with sleeping Esquimaux and  reeked with seal oil and fish, but Hans said it \"looked good and smelled  good to him,\" and so it did to me also. One has to lie out on that coast  in a storm to appreciate the value of mere shelter. We went at once to  cooking, for we had eaten nothing but a doughnut or two in twenty-four  hours, and surely never meal was more relished than the reindeer steaks  and the coffee we took amongst those still sleeping Esquimaux. I should  have liked to spend the day and the next night there, for they were  friendly and kindly, but the wind had moderated somewhat and there was  still a chance to reach Candle for Sunday. With the offer of a sack of  flour at Kewalik we induced a couple of Esquimaux to accompany us, for I  knew we had to cross the mouth of a bay over the ice to reach the  mainland and I wanted to take no more chances.    Our company, again raised to four, started out about nine, and until the  Choris Peninsula was reached the trail still skirted the shore. It is  strange that Kotzebue, who named this peninsula of a peninsula for the  artist who accompanied his expedition "]]]
