Rogue  is made in Norway and Denmark, but principally at Drontheim, and is very  expensive, costing about sixpence the lb.; hence an inferior bait is  substituted, composed of shrimps and other small crustacea, with fish  salted, and the heads of anchovies, all pounded and putrified together.  But this kind of decomposed bait is forbidden by the fishery laws. The  employment of it accounts for the rareness of good sardines, as the  remaining of such a substance in the body of the animal cannot fail of  corrupting it. It is a pretty sight to behold the little fleet employed in  the sardine fishery return in the evening, laden with the results of the  day's work. The fish, when landed, are counted out into baskets, shaken in  the water, and taken up to one of the curing-houses: of these there are  about sixty in Concarneau. In the first shed we saw above fifty women  employed in taking off their heads--\"deteter\" it is called--an operation  they effect with great dexterity. With one cut at the back of the neck the  head is separated and the fish \"eventre\" at the same time.    The sardines are next placed in little wire trays, with divisions like a  double gridiron, and fried or dipped in boiling oil, an operation  principally performed by the women of Pont l'Abbe, who are supposed, like  the Germans of our baking and sugar-refining houses, to be peculiarly  constituted to resist heat. The gridirons are then hung up to drain. The  sardines are next packed in tin boxes, cold oil poured over them, and the  boxes soldered down. From 800 to 900 boxes are placed in a boiler and  boiled for half an hour to test the boxes, and those which leak are put  aside. They are of English tin, and the making of them is the winter's  occupation. Finally, the boxes are stamped with the name of the  establishment, and packed in deal cases for exportation. The sardine is a  very delicate fish, and easily decays. It is only taken out of the net  with a rake (_raquette_); in summer, numbers are spoiled from being heaped  in the boats, and at whatever hour the boats come in the fish go through  the whole process of curing, as they will not keep till the next day.  Concarneau exports from 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of sardines annually.  Only a part are \"anchoitee,\" that is, preserved like the anchovies of the  Mediterranean, the others are salted in casks; and quantities, only  slightly salted, are packed in baskets, to be sent to the provincial  markets. It is estimated that twelve hundred million fish have been caught  this year. The sardine fishery extends along the whole western coast of  Brittany from Douarnenez to the Loire.    One of the curiosities of Concarneau is its aquarium, under the direction  of M. Guillon. It consists of six cisterns, made by the blasting of the  solid rock, and comprising an area of large extent, within a walled  enclosure. In these cisterns the water is renewed at each turn of the tide  through narrow openings in the wall. Three of these reservoirs are  reserved for fish, the others for crustacea--lobsters and langoustes. Of  these they keep from 10,000 to 15,000 at a time, and send them off daily,  when fattened, to Paris and the principal markets of France. It was  curious to see the dread shown by the common lobster to the langouste.  They all were adhering to the sides of the reservoirs as if afraid to  encounter their more powerful companions. Quantities of turbot, also  reared for sale, were in one of the cisterns, darting with the greatest  rapidity in the water when the keeper threw in pieces of sardines for them  to eat. At the end of these cisterns is a building, with every arrangement  for the culture of fishes--rows of little troughs, and other vessels, to  contain them. Many of the fish are so tame, they came immediately to the  keeper on his making a noise in the water with his fingers. Here are fish  of every description, and naturalists have every facility of studying  their habits. Among others, we saw the graceful little sea-horse or  hippocampus, a native of the seas of Brittany as well as of the  Mediterranean.    [Illustration: 30. Dolmen. Tregunc.]    From Concarneau to Quimperle is a distance of above eighteen miles. The  road runs near the sea, over a large tract of land covered with furze  (ajonc), which, in Brittany, grows from five to six feet high, forming a  solid impenetrable mass. Huge blocks of granite are scattered about in  every direction, jutting out from among the furze--menhirs, cromlechs, and  dolmens--a perfect wilderness of Celtic remains. We drove over an extent of  several miles of furze-covered hills and heathy land. Before we reached  the village of Tregunc we stopped to see a large dolmen on the side of the  road, and further to the right a rocking-stone, twelve feet long and nine  feet thick, standing about fifteen feet from the ground, the second  largest in Brittany. It is poised by a little projection, like an inverted  cone, upon another rock lying half-buried in the ground. The upper block  can easily be set in motion by the hand. It is called by the country  people \"La pierre aux maris trompes,\" and was formerly consulted by  husbands to test the fidelity of their wives. Even now the partner of a  faithless wife is said to be incapable of giving to the stone the rocking  motion it so easily receives from another.    [Illustration: 31. Rocking Stone. Tregunc.]    On the left we passed the majestic ruins of the castle of Rustephan,  _i. e._ Run, mound, of Stephen, having been built by Stephen Count of  Penthievre at the beginning of the twelfth century. It belonged in the  thirteenth to Blanche of Castile, the mother of St. Louis. The present  edifice dates from the fifteenth. One of the sides remaining has a  cylindrical tower with pinnacled doorway, and the windows have stone  mullions.    [Illustration: 32. Chateau of Rustephan.]    Pursuing our road through blocks of granite, we descended into the valley  of Pontaven, the town of millers, according to the old saying--          \"Pont Aven, ville de renom;      Quatorze moulins, deux maisons;\"      a little port built upon rocks, at the foot of two elevated mountains,  over which are scattered masses of granite boulders, obstructing the  course of the river which bounds over them. The banks are lined with woody  slopes; wooden bridges cross the river at intervals; mills are established  on the ledges of the rocks on its sides; and the noise of the mills, with  that of the sparkling river tumbling through the rocks in waterfalls, keep  up a perpetual din. Pontaven is celebrated for the quantity of its salmon:  so much is taken, that it used to be said that the millers fattened their  pigs upon this fish, which was literally true, as they took the small  salmon, called glesils, in nets (_poches_) for that purpose. Salmon now is  very dear. At the mouth of the Pontaven river was a castle, whose  proprietor had the privilege of firing upon the fishing-boats which  returned up the river without giving to the castellan their finest fish,  which his steward went down to select. Pontaven is seven and a half miles  from Bannalec, the nearest railway station. After remaining a few hours we  drove on to Quimperle--in Breton, Kemper (confluence) Elle--so called,  because it is at the confluence of two rivers, the Elle and Isole:--          \"Vous reverrai-je encore, o fleuve de l'Elle,      Vous, Izole, ou mon coeur est toujours rappelle!      Les eaux sombres de l'Elle, claire ceux de l'Izole;      De ces bords enchantes je dirais chaque saule.\"                      BRIZEUX.      Quimperle is a great resort for fishing, the Quimperle salmon and trout  being renowned throughout Brittany, and even at Paris. This town is  beautifully situated, surrounded by high hills, in a valley, watered by  these bright rivers, the hills covered with gardens, orchards, the  Ursuline, Capucine, and other convents, and crowned by the steeples of the  Gothic church of St. Michael. Its principal building is the church of St.  Croix, formerly that of a Benedictine abbey, celebrated for its riches.  The island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer then belonged to it. It is a most singular  edifice, built in the eleventh century, after the model of the church of  the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. In 1862 it fell down, but is at present  in course of restoration, after its original plan. The old abbey buildings  are now occupied by the Prefecture. We were given permission to pass  through the convent garden--the workmen and building materials having  blocked up the other entrances--to see the crypt in which is the tomb of  Saint Gurloes, first abbot of Quimperle. His effigy, with crosier in hand,  his feet resting on a dragon, lies upon a monument, about three feet high,  with an opening in the lower part. The saint--Saint Urlose, as the Bretons  call him--is invoked principally for the gout, and persons so afflicted  crawl through the hole under the tomb, where, suspended by chains, is an  iron hook. They twist a lock of their hair round this hook, and tear it  off with violence, hoping to propitiate the saint by this  mortification--evidently a remnant of heathen times, when hair was  sacrificed to deities or to the memory of departed friends.    At Quimperle was buried John de Montfort, rival of Charles of Blois for  the ducal crown. Sent to Paris under a safe-conduct by the Dauphin John,  Philip of Valois had him shut up in the Louvre, whence he escaped, after a  captivity of three years, to England. Edward III. espoused his cause and  granted him some troops. After an unsuccessful attack upon Quimper, De  Montfort died (1345) at Hennebont, and was buried in the church of the  Dominicans at Quimperle. He appointed Edward III. guardian of his son, and  Edward immediately occupied Quimperle and caused money to be struck in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#19)"],[1,"of imagination the answer, of course, is obvious. The  better tales all had the exaltation of the chivalric spirit in view, and  sought to achieve this end by allegory as well as by parable. He must be  a dullard indeed who fails to understand their symbolism. Malory,  describing the entry of Tristram into the field, wishes to impress upon  us the fact that he was indeed a 'preux chevalier, sans peur et sans  reproche,' the model of a Christian knight; so he mounts him on a white  horse and arrays him in white harness, and he rides out at a postern,  'and soo he came in to the feld as it had ben a bryght angel.' Doubtless  those to whom understanding has been denied would argue hotly as to  whether there is any authority for a knight painting his armour white.  What sane man, reading 'The Faerie Queene,' could think that it purported  to depict actual scenes or incidents? Yet time and again the 'sheer  impossibility' of these stories has been urged in condemnation of them.  Truly it is not every man who should turn to these ancient books which        'In sage and solemn tunes have sung       Of Turneys and of Trophies hung,       Of Forests, and inchantments drear,       _Where more is meant than meets the ear_.'    Gavaudan, a troubadour of the twelfth century, meets the undiscerning  critic more than half-way. Let none judge, he writes, till he be capable  of separating the grain from the chaff; 'for the fool makes haste to  condemn, and the ignorant only pretends to know all things, and muses on  the wonders that are too mighty for his comprehension.'    'Romances,' says Sharon Turner, 'are so many little Utopias, in which the  writer tries to paint or to inculcate something which he considers to be  more useful, more happy or more delightful, more excellent or more  interesting, than the world he lives in, than the characters he surveys,  or the events or evils which he experiences.' Yet Dunlop, who examined  the romances of chivalry at some length in his 'History of Fiction,'  seems never to have suspected that these tales were written with any  other intention than to amuse or that the events which they related were  looked upon by their readers as other than facts. For Arthur he has scant  respect, 'nor,' says he, 'as we advance, do we find him possessed of a  single quality, except strength and courage, to excite respect or  interest.' Surely the remark of one who must have been dead to all sense  of imagination and romance--although purporting to be an authority upon  them! The teaching of the whole Arthurian cycle of romances was 'that  noble men may see and lerne the noble actes of chyualrye, the Ientyl and  vertuous dedes that somme Knyghtes vsed in tho dayes, by whyche they came  to honour; and how they that were vycious were punysshed and ofte put to  shame and rebuke.' The quest of the Holy Grail, motive of the most  exquisite series of mystic tales that has ever been written, was, we are  expressly informed, 'the hygh way of our Lord Jhesu Cryst, and the way of  a true good lyver, not that of synners and of mysbelievers.' Godfrey de  Bouillon, the hero of another cycle, was 'moult preudhomme et sage et  moult aymant Dieu et gens d'esglise,' as we read in 'Le Triomphe des Neuf  Preux' (folio, Abbeville 1487). Preposterous tales? Perhaps; yet, as  regards their moral side, not suffering greatly by comparison with our  modern fiction.    Those whose reading is confined to the literature of to-day can have no  idea of the influence which these romances had upon the lives of our  forefathers. It was not merely a system of morality which they taught, it  was a civilisation of a very high order. When we are inclined to mock at  these 'preposterous tales' we should never forget that to them we owe a  debt so immense that we are lost in the contemplation of it. It cannot be  gainsaid that it was as much by the study and teaching of these romances  as it was by the spirit which gave them birth, that our ancestors came to  mould their lives in such a sort as to influence the civilisation of the  whole of the western world.    That the romances were the outcome of chivalry cannot be urged, though  doubtless in a later age they helped to keep the spirit of knighthood  alive. Edward the Black Prince, the very model of mediaeval chivalry,  avowedly studied the ancient romances for patterns. When Pedro the Cruel  had prevailed upon the prince to defend his cause, the princess bitterly  bewailed her husband's decision. 'I see well,' said the prince, to whom  her expressions were related, 'that she wishes me to be always at her  side and never to leave her chamber. But a prince must be ready to win  renown and to expose himself to all kinds of danger, as in days of old  did Roland, Oliver, Ogier, the four sons of Aimon, Charlemagne, the great  Leon de Bourges, Juan de Tournant, Lancelot, Tristan, Alexander, Arthur  and Godfrey whose courage, bravery, and fearlessness, both warlike and  heroic, all the romances extoll. And by Saint George, I will restore  Spain to the rightful heir.'    Occleve, a little later, has no doubt as to the beneficial effects of  perusing the romances. Indeed he goes so far as to exhort his friend, Sir  John Oldcastle, to leave off studying Holy Writ, and to read 'Lancelot de  lake, Vegece, or the Siege of Troie or Thebes.' 'What do ye now,' says  Caxton in 'The Order of Chivalry,' 'but go to the baynes and playe atte  dyse? . . . Leve this, leve it, and rede the noble volumes of Saynt  Graal, of Lancelot, of Galaad, of Trystram, of Perseforest, of Percyval,  of Gawayn, and many mo. Ther shalle ye see manhode, curtosye, and  gentylnesse.'    What other system in this world could have bestowed that absolute  serenity of mind which those who practised chivalry retained amid the  tumults of their life? The Saracens, abashed by the tranquil spirit of  their royal prisoner, Louis IX., mistook his humility for pride. In vain  did they threaten him with torture: the king only replied 'Je suis  prisonnier du Sultan, il peut faire de moi a son vouloir.' And when at  last the Sultan's murderer rushed into his prison, his hands dripping  with blood, and crying, 'What will you give me for having destroyed him  who would have put you to death?' the king was more struck with horror at  the crime than with fear for his own safety, and remained motionless,  disdaining to answer. Thereupon the Saracen, maddened by a tranquillity  which he rightly attributed to the immense power of Christian chivalry,  presented the point of his blood-stained sword to the king's breast,  crying, 'Fais moi chevalier, ou je te tue.' 'Fais toi Chrestien,' replied  the intrepid king, 'et je te ferai chevalier.'    We are accustomed nowadays to look upon chivalry merely as a knightly  institution which had to do solely with tournaments, banquets,  knight-errantry, and the rescuing of encastled maidens. The modern  acceptance of the term omits all those gentle qualities of mind which go  to make the true chivalric disposition. We associate chivalry with 'fair  play' combined with 'manliness'; and humility has no part in it. Indeed  it never enters into our mind that it was a system of 'humanyte,  curtosye, and gentylnesse.' More, it was a religion deeply ingrained in  the hearts of men, a religion which spread through all grades of society,  and one which consisted in the beatifying of the noblest qualities of  human nature; and it has left an indelible mark upon our national  character. Chivalry is not dead to-day as thoughtless people so often  exclaim; it will never die so long as our national characteristics  endure, though to-day it passes under a different name. 'Sport' we call  it now, and we pride ourselves in being 'sporting' even in the hour of  death--witness the countless instances brought about by the late great  war.    Bertrand du Guesclin, one of the greatest and most fearless exponents of  the chivalric spirit, and the Black Prince's most redoubtable enemy, fell  at last into the hands of the English. One day at Bordeaux the Prince  summoned him from his prison, and asked him how he fared. 'Par may foy,  monseigneur,' replied Bertrand, 'il m'ennuye de n'entendre que le chant  des Souris de Bourdeaux; je voudrois bien ouyr les Rossignols de nostre  pais'; but he added that he loved honour better than aught else and never  had anything brought him more glory than his prison, seeing that, as all  the other prisoners had been ransomed, he was kept there only through  fear of his prowess. The Prince of Wales, touched in his honour (or  rather pride) at du Guesclin's words, agreed to liberate Bertrand upon  payment of seventy thousand florins of gold.[34] 'But what was more  extraordinary in this adventure,' says a French chronicler, 'was that the  Princess of Wales gave him thirty thousand, and Sir John Chandos, who had  taken him prisoner, took upon himself to pay what was wanting to make the  sum complete.' 'Sporting,' was it not? Truly we are a marvellous race,  and it is not to be wondered that other nations, from whom this spirit  has long passed away, despair of ever being able to understand us.    England has always been the home of chivalry. La Colombiere in his 'Vray  Theatre d'Honneur et de Chevalerie ou le Miroir Heroique de la Noblesse'  remarks that the greatest number of the old romances have been more  particularly employed in celebrating the valour of the knights of this  kingdom than that of any other; because, in fact, they have always loved  such exercises in an especial manner. 'The city of London,' writes  Francisco de Moraes in the 'Palmerin de Inglaterra,' 'contained in those  days all, or the greater part, of the chivalry of the world.' In  Perceforest a damozel says to his companion 'Sire chevalier, I will  gladly parley with you because you come from Great Britain; it is a  country which I love well, for there habitually (coustumierement) is the  finest chivalry in the world; c'est"]]]
