I had it in the inner pocket of my coat all the time.\"    \"You are sure no one took the things out while you were asleep last  night?\"    \"Why--I--I don't see how they could,\" faltered Mr. Ackerman. \"My  servants are honest--at least, they always have been. I have had them  for years. Moreover, none of them knew I had valuable papers about me.  How could they?\" was the reply.    Once more silence fell upon the room.    \"Come, Tolman,\" ejaculated the steamboat man presently, \"you are a  level-headed person. What is your theory?\"    \"If I did not know my son and myself as well as I do,\" Mr. Tolman  answered with deliberation, \"my theory would be precisely what I fancy  yours is. I should reason that during the interval between the finding  of the purse and its return the contents had been extracted.\"    He saw the New Yorker color.    \"That, I admit, is my logical theory,\" Mr. Ackerman owned with a blush,  \"but it is not my intuitive one. My brain tells me one thing and my  heart another; and in spite of the fact that the arguments of my brain  seem correct I find myself believing my heart and in consequence  cherishing a groundless faith in you and your boy,\" concluded he, with a  faint smile.    \"That is certainly generous of you, Ackerman!\" Mr. Tolman returned, much  moved by the other's confidence. \"Stephen and I are in a very  compromising situation with nothing but your belief between us and a  great deal of unpleasantness. We appreciate your attitude of mind more  than we can express. The only other explanation I can offer, and in the  face of the difficulties it would involve it hardly seems a possible  one, is that while the coat was hanging in the lobby--\"    There was a sound outside and a sharp knock at the door, and an instant  later Mr. Donovan entered, his face wreathed in smiles. Following him  was the woman who had checked the coats, a much frightened bell boy, and  a blue-uniformed policeman.    The woman was sobbing.    \"Indeed, sir,\" she wailed, approaching Steve, \"I never meant to keep the  pocketbook and make trouble for you. I have a boy of my own at home, a  lad about your age. What is to become of him now? Oh, dear; oh, dear!\"    She burst into passionate weeping.    \"Now see here, my good woman, stop all this crying and talk quietly,\"  cut in the policeman in a curt but not unkind tone. \"If you will tell us  the truth, perhaps we can help you. In any case we must know exactly  what happened.\"    \"She must understand that anything she says can be used against her,\"  cautioned the detective, who in spite of his eagerness to solve the  mystery was determined the culprit should have fair play.    \"Indeed, I don't care, sir,\" protested the maid, wiping her eyes on her  ridiculously small apron. \"I can't be any worse off than I am now with a  policeman taking me to the lock-up. I'll tell the gentlemen the truth, I  swear I will.\"    With a courtesy he habitually displayed toward all womanhood Mr. Tolman  drew forward a chair and she sank gratefully into it.    \"I spied the bill book in the young gentleman's pocket the minute he  took off his coat,\" began she in a low tone. \"It was bright colored and  as it was sticking part way out I couldn't help seeing it. Of course, I  expected he would take it with him into the dining room but when he  didn't I came to the conclusion that there couldn't be anything of value  in it. But by and by I had more coats to hang up and one of them, a big,  heavy, fur-lined one, brushed against the young gentleman's ulster and  knocked the pocketbook out on to the floor so that it lay open under the  coat rack. It was then that I saw it was stuffed full of papers and  things.\"    She stopped a moment to catch her breath and then went resolutely on:    \"It seemed to me it was no sort of a plan to put the wallet back into  the lad's pocket, for when I wasn't looking somebody might take it. So I  decided I much better keep it safe for him, and maybe,\" she owned with a  blush, \"get a good-sized tip for doing it. I have a big pocket in my  underskirt where I carry my own money and I slipped it right in there,  meaning to hand it to the young man when he came out from lunch.\"    The corners of her mouth twitched and her tears began to fall again, but  she wiped them away with her apron and proceeded steadily:    \"But nothing turned out as I planned, for no sooner was the bill book in  my pocket than I was called away to help about the wraps at a lady's  luncheon upstairs. There were so many people about the hall that I had  no chance to restore the bill book to the lad's pocket without some one  seeing me and thinking, perhaps, that I was stealing. There was no help  but to take it with me, trusting they would not keep me long upstairs  and that I would get back to my regular place before the young gentleman  came out of the dining room. It was when I got out of the elevator in  the upper hall that I spied Dick, one of the bell boys I knew, and I  called to him; and after explaining that I couldn't get away to go  downstairs I asked him to take the wallet and put it in 47's pocket.  He's a good-natured little chap and always ready to do an errand, and  more than that he's an honest boy. So I felt quite safe and went to  work, supposing the young man had his pocketbook long ago.\"    All eyes were turned upon the unlucky bell boy who hung his head and  colored uncomfortably.    \"So it was the boy who took the contents of the pocketbook!\" was Mr.  Ackerman's comment.    \"Speak up, boy,\" commanded the officer. \"The gentleman is talking to  you.\" The lad looked up with a frightened start.    He might have been sixteen years of age but he did not look it for he  was pale and underfed; nor was there anything in his bearing to indicate  the poise and maturity of one who was master of the occasion. On the  contrary, he was simply a boy who was frankly distressed and frightened,  and as unfeignedly helpless in the present emergency as if he had been  six years old and been caught stealing jam from the pantry shelf. It did  not take more than a glance to convince the onlookers that he was no  hardened criminal. If he had done wrong it had been the result either of  impulse or mischief, and the dire result of his deed was a thing he had  been too unsophisticated to foresee. The plight in which he now found  himself plainly amazed and overwhelmed him and he looked pleadingly at  his captors.    \"Well, my boy, what have you to say for yourself?\" repeated Mr. Ackerman  more gently.    \"Nothin'.\"    \"Nothing?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You did take the things out of the pocketbook then.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"But you are not a boy accustomed to taking what does not belong to  you.\"    The culprit shot a glance of gratitude toward the speaker but made no  reply.    \"How did you happen to do it this time?\" persisted Mr. Ackerman kindly.  \"Come, tell me all about it.\"    Perhaps it was the ring of sympathy in the elder man's voice that won  the boy's heart. Whatever the charm, it conquered; and he met the eyes  that scanned his countenance with a timid smile.    \"I wanted to see what was in the pocketbook,\" said he with naive  honesty, \"and so I took the things out to look at them. I wasn't goin'  to keep 'em. I dodged into one of the little alcoves in the hall and had  just pulled the papers out when I heard somebody comin'. So I crammed  the whole wad of stuff into my pocket, waiting for a time when I could  look it over and put it back. But I got held up just like Mrs. Nolan  did,\" he pointed toward the woman in the chair. \"Some man was sick and  the clerk sent me to get a bottle of medicine the minute I got  downstairs, and all I had the chance to do was to stick the empty wallet  in 47's pocket and beat it for the drug store. I thought there would be  letters or something among the papers that would give the name of the  man they belonged to, and I'd take 'em to the clerk at the desk an' say  I found 'em. But no sooner had I got the medicine up to room Number 792  than the policeman nabbed me with the papers an' things on me. That's  all there is to it, sir.\"    \"Have you the things now?\" the officer put in quickly.    \"Sure! Didn't I just tell you I hadn't had the chance to hand 'em over  to the clerk,\" the boy reiterated, pulling a wad of crumpled Liberty  Bonds and documents out of his pocket, and tumbling them upon the table.    There was no doubting the lad's story. Truth spoke in every line of his  face and in the frankness with which he met the scrutiny of those who  listened to him. If one had questioned his uprightness the facts bore  out his statements, for once out of the hotel on an errand he might  easily have taken to his heels and never returned; or he might have  disposed of his booty during his absence. But he had done neither. He  had gone to the drug store and come back with every intention of making  restitution for the result of his curiosity. That was perfectly evident.    \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he declared, when no one spoke. \"I know I shouldn't  have looked in the pocketbook or touched the papers; but I meant no  harm--honest I didn't.\"    \"I'll be bound of that, sir,\" the woman interrupted. \"Dick was ever a  lad to be trusted. The hotel people will tell you that. He's been here  several years and there's never been a thing against him. I blame myself  for getting him into this trouble, for without meaning to I put  temptation in his way. I know that what he's told you is the living  truth, and I pray you'll try and believe him and let him go. If harm was  to come to the lad through me I'd never forgive myself. Let the boy go  free and put the blame on me, if you must arrest somebody. I'm older and  it doesn't so much matter; but it's terrible to start a child of his  age in as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#19)"],[1,"the  fire.    Maidwa thought that the old man did not know that he was standing near  the door; but in this he was mistaken; for, without turning his eyes to  look at him, the old man said, \"Walk in, my grandchild; take a seat  opposite to me, and take off your things and dry them, for you must be  fatigued; and I will prepare you something to eat; you shall have  something very delicate.\"    Maidwa accepted this kind invitation, and entered the lodge. The old man  then remarked, as if in mere course of conversation: \"My kettle with  water stands near the fire;\" and immediately a small earthen pot with  legs appeared by the fire. He then took one grain of corn, also one of  whortleberry, and put them in the pot.    Maidwa was very hungry, and seeing the limited scale of the old man's  housekeeping, he thought his chance for a supper was very slight. The  old man had promised him something very delicate, and he seemed likely  to keep his word. Maidwa looked on silently, and did not change his face  any more than if the greatest banquet that was ever spread had been  going forward.    The pot soon boiled, when the old man said in a very quiet way:    \"The pot will stand at a distance from the fire.\"    It removed itself, and the old man added to Maidwa:    \"My grandchild, feed yourself;\" handing him at the same time a dish and  ladle of the same ware as the pot itself.    The young man, whose hunger was very great, helped himself to all that  was in the pot. He felt ashamed to think that he had done so, but before  he could speak the old man said:    \"Eat, nay grandchild; eat, eat!\" and soon after he again said--\"Help  yourself from the pot.\"    Maidwa was surprised, on dipping in his ladle, to see that it was full;  and although he emptied it a second time, it was still again filled and  refilled till his hunger was entirely satisfied. The old man then  observed, without raising his voice:    \"The pot will return to its corner;\" and the pot took itself off to its  accustomed place in an out-of-the-way corner of the lodge.    Maidwa observed that the old man was about to address him, and took an  attitude which showed that he was prepared to listen.    \"Keep on, my grandchild,\" said the old man; \"you will surely gain that  you seek. To tell you more I am not permitted; but go on as you have  begun and you will not be disappointed. To-morrow you will again reach  one of my fellow old men, but the one you will see after him will tell  you all, and the manner in which you must proceed to accomplish your  journey. Often has this Red Swan passed, and those who have followed it  have never returned; but you must be firm in your resolution, and be  prepared for all that may happen.\"    \"So will it be,\" answered Maidwa; and they both laid down to sleep.    Early in the morning the old man ordered his magic kettle to prepare  breakfast, so that his guest might eat before leaving. As Maidwa passed  out, the old man gave him a blessing with his parting advice.    Maidwa set forth in better spirits than at any time since he had  started. Night again found him in company with an old man who  entertained him kindly, with a frisky little kettle which hurried up to  the fire before it was spoken to, bustled about and set his supper  briskly before Maidwa, and frisked away again, without waiting for  orders. The old man also carefully directed him on his way in the  morning.    He traveled with a light heart, as he now expected to meet the one who  was to give him directions how to proceed to get the Red Swan.    Toward night-fall Maidwa reached the lodge of the third old man. Before  coming to the door he heard him saying:    \"Grandchild, come in;\" and going in promptly he felt quite at home.    The old man prepared him something to eat, acting as the other magicians  had done, and his kettle was of the same size, and looked as if it were  an own brother of the two others which had feasted him, except that this  kettle, in coming and going about its household duties, would make a  passing remark, or sing a little tune for itself.    The old man waited until Maidwa had fully satisfied his hunger, when he  addressed him:    \"Young man, the errand you are bound on is beset with trials and  difficulties. Numbers have passed with the same purpose as that which  now prompts you, but they never returned. Be careful, and if your  guardian spirits are powerful you may succeed. This Red Swan you are  following is the daughter of a magician who has abundance of every  thing, but only this one child, whom he values more than the sacred  arrows. In former times he wore a cap of wampum, which was attached to  his scalp; but powerful Indians, warriors of a distant chief, came and  told him that their chief's daughter was on the brink of the grave, and  that she herself requested his wampum-cap, which she was confident would  save her life. 'If I can only see it,' she said, 'I will recover.' It  was for this cap they had come, and after long solicitation the magician  at length consented to part with it, in the hope that it would restore  to health the dying maiden, although when he took it off to hand it to  the messengers it left the crown of his head bare and bloody. Years have  passed since, and it has not healed. The coming of the warriors to  procure it for the sick maiden was a cheat, and they are now constantly  making sport of the unhappy scalp--dancing it about from village to  village--and on every insult it receives the poor old chief to whom it  belongs groans with pain. Those who hold it are too powerful for the  magician, and many have sacrificed themselves to recover it for him, but  without success. The Red Swan has enticed many a young man, as she has  you, to enlist them to procure the scalp, and whoever is so fortunate as  to succeed, it is understood, will receive the Red Swan as his reward.  In the morning you will proceed on your way, and toward evening you will  come to this magician's lodge. You will know it by the groans which you  will hear far over the prairie as you approach. He will ask you in. You  will see no one but himself. He will question you much as to your dreams  and the strength of your guardian spirits. If he is satisfied with your  answers, he will urge you to attempt the recovery of his scalp. He will  show you the course to take, and if you feel inclined, as I see that  you do, go forward, my son, with a strong heart; persevere, and I have a  presentiment that you will succeed.\"    Maidwa answered, \"I will try.\"    Betimes in the morning, after having eaten from the magic kettle, which  sung a sort of farewell chant on its way from the fire-place to its  station in the corner, he set off on his journey.    Toward evening, Maidwa, as he crossed a prairie, heard, as had been  predicted, groans from a distant lodge, which were only interrupted by a  voice from a person whom he could not see, calling to him aloud:    \"Come in! come in!\"    On entering the lodge, the magician heaved a great groan from the very  bottom of his chest, and Maidwa saw that the crown of his head was all  bare and bloody.    \"Sit down, sit down,\" he said, \"while I prepare you something to eat.  You see how poor I am. I have to attend to all my own wants, with no  other servant than that poor little kettle in the corner. Kettle, we  will have something to eat, if you please.\"    \"In a moment,\" the kettle spoke up from the corner.    \"You will oblige me by making all the dispatch you can,\" said the  magician, in a very humble tone, still addressing the kettle.    \"Have patience,\" replied the kettle, \"and I will be with you presently.\"    After a considerable delay, there came forward out of the corner from  which it had spoken, a great heavy-browed and pot-bodied kettle, which  advanced with much stateliness and solemnity of manner till it had come  directly in front of the magician, whom it addressed with the question:    \"What shall we have, sir?\"    \"Corn, if you please,\" the magician answered.    \"No, we will have whortleberries,\" rejoined the kettle, in a firm voice.    \"Very well; just as you choose.\"    When he supposed it was time, the magician invited Maidwa to help  himself.    \"Hold a minute,\" interposed the kettle, as Maidwa was about to dip in  his ladle. He paused, and after a delay, the kettle, shaking itself up  and simmering very loudly, said, \"Now we are ready.\"    Maidwa fell to and satisfied his hunger.    \"Will the kettle now withdraw?\" asked the magician, with am air of much  deference.    \"No,\" said the kettle, \"we will stay and hear what the young man has to  say for himself.\"    \"Very well,\" said the magician. \"You see,\" he added to Maidwa, \"how poor  I am. I have to take counsel with the kettle, or I should be all alone,  without a day's food, and with no one to advise me.\"    All this time the Red Swan was carefully concealed in the lodge, behind  a curtain, from which Maidwa heard now and then a rustling noise, that  fluttered his spirits and set his heart to beating at a wonderful rate.    As soon as Maidwa had partaken of food and laid aside his leggings and  moccasins, the old magician commenced telling him how he had lost his  scalp, the insults it was receiving, the pain he suffered thereby, his  wishes to regain it, the many unsuccessful attempts that had already  been made, and the numbers and power of those who retained it. He would  interrupt his discourse, at times, with sudden groans, and say:    \"Oh, how shamefully they are treating it.\"    Maidwa listened to all the old magician had to say with solemn  attention.    The magician renewed his discourse, and inquired of Maidwa as to his  dreams, or what he saw in his sleep, at such times as he had fasted and  darkened his face to procure guardian spirits.    Maidwa then told him one dream. The magician groaned.    \"No, that is not it,\" he said.    Maidwa told him of two or three others.    The magician groaned again and again, and"]]]
