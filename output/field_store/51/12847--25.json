pill three  times a day, or a tonic of iron, quinine and strychnine, will do good.  A daily cold bath or cold sponge, followed by a brisk dry rubbing with  a rough towel, is also useful.    =Local Treatment.= Local measures consist of painting or swabbing the  vagina and cervix with various solutions, of tampons, suppositories  and douches. Local application to the vagina and uterus can be done  satisfactorily by the physician or nurse only. The insertion of a  suppository or douching can be easily done by the patient herself.    While it is always best and safest to consult a physician, and, while  self-medication is generally inadvisable, there are occasions when a  physician is not available; in some small places a woman may, _for  various reasons_, have a strong objection to gynecological examination  and treatment; and some women may be too poor to pay the doctor. In  such circumstances self-treatment is justified and there can be no  objection to it if the remedies are harmless and are sure to do some  good; that is, to improve the condition where they do not effect a  complete cure.    One of the simplest things is an alum tampon. You take a piece of  absorbent cotton, about the size of a fist, spread it out, put about a  tablespoonful of powdered alum on it, fold it up, tie a string around  the center, insert it in the vagina as far as it will go, and leave it  in for twenty-four hours. Then pull it gently by the string and  syringe yourself with a quart or two quarts of warm water. Such a  tampon may be inserted every other day or every third day, and I have  known many cases where this simple treatment alone produced a cure. In  some cases, however, douches work better and the two best things for  douching are: tincture of iodine and lactic acid. Buy, say, four  ounces of tincture of iodine, and use two teaspoonfuls in two quarts  of hot water in a douche bag. This injection should be used twice a  day, morning and night. Of the lactic acid you buy, say, a pint, and  use two tablespoonfuls to two quarts of water. The lactic acid has the  advantage over the tincture of iodine that it is colorless, while the  iodine is dark and stains whatever it comes in contact with. Sometimes  I order the use of the tincture of iodine and the lactic acid  alternately: for one douche the tincture of iodine, for the next the  lactic acid, and so on. When the condition improves, it is sufficient  to use one teaspoonful of the tincture of iodine and one tablespoonful  of the lactic acid to two quarts of water. These injections are quite  efficient and have the advantage of being perfectly harmless. One  point about the injections: they should be taken not in the standing  or squatting position (in which position the fluid comes right out),  but while lying down, over a douche pan. The douche bag should be only  about a foot above the bed, so that the irrigating fluid may come out  slowly; the patient, after each injection taken in the daytime, should  remain at least half an hour in bed (in the night time she stays all  night in bed). This gives the injection a better chance to come in  contact with all the parts of the vagina, and a portion of it comes in  contact with the cervix, where it exerts a healing effect. Avoid the  use of patent medicines.          CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE    THE VENEREAL DISEASES     Derivation of Word \"Venereal\"--Three Venereal Diseases--Innocent    Contraction of Syphilis Through Various Objects--The Hygienic    Elimination of Common Sources of Venereal Infection--Measures for    Prevention After Sexual Relations.      The word \"venereal\" means pertaining to sexual intercourse: venereal  excess--excess in sexual intercourse; venereal disease--a disease  acquired from sexual intercourse with an infected person. The word is  derived from Venus (genitive--veneris), the Roman goddess of spring,  flowers and Love.    There are three venereal diseases: gonorrhea, syphilis and chancroid.  Of these, gonorrhea is the most widespread, syphilis the most serious.  Chancroid is of comparatively little importance.    While by far the greatest amount of venereal diseases--probably ninety  per cent, of the total--is contracted from illicit[7] intercourse, it  is well to bear in mind that some of it is contracted innocently,  either from a kiss, or from using a sponge or a towel which has been  used by an infected person, etc. While the gonorrheal germ is  generally transmitted directly, the syphilitic poison may be  transmitted through various objects. Syphilis contracted not during  intercourse, but in an innocent manner, from a kiss, a towel, a  toothbrush, a razor, etc., is called syphilis of the innocent, or  syphilis insontium. In former years doctors would not very rarely  contract syphilis from examining syphilitic women with their bare  fingers. Now since gloves have come into use for examining purposes,  the number of infections has considerably diminished. And no doubt  that as the people become more familiar with the danger of venereal  infection from non-venereal sources, the number of innocent infections  will greatly diminish. The dangerous roller towel and the no less  dangerous common drinking cup are being gradually eliminated as  factors of _non-venereal_ infection; and we may confidently expect  that in a decade or two the amount of venereal disease from _venereal_  infection will be greatly lessened in all civilized countries. The  general increase in cleanliness in all strata of society and the  universal use of antiseptics after suspicious sexual relations will  constitute the chief factors in this diminution of venereal disease.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO    THE EXTENT OF VENEREAL DISEASE     Former Ban on Discussion of Venereal Disease and Its Evil    Results--Present Reprehensible Exaggerations of Extent of    Venereal Disease--Erroneous and Ridiculous Statements of    \"Reformers\"--Senseless Fear of Marriage in Girls Due to Lurid    Exaggerations--Study by Woman Psychologist Reveals Harmful    Results of Exaggerated Statements--Truth in Regard to Percentage    of Men Afflicted with Venereal Disease.      =Former Silence.= Only a very few years ago respectable women, by  which I mean all women outside of the women called \"fallen,\" did not  know of the existence of venereal disease. It was considered a  prohibited, disgraceful subject, not to be mentioned or even hinted at  in conversation, in books or magazines, in lectures, or on the stage.  When I say that they did not know of the _existence_ of such a thing  as venereal disease, that the very words gonorrhea and syphilis were  unknown to them, I use these expressions not as figures of speech, but  in their literal meaning. All avenues of acquiring such knowledge  being closed to them--lay people don't usually now and they surely  didn't then purchase and read strictly medical works--where could they  obtain the information? The result was that when a woman was so  unfortunate as to contract a venereal disease from her husband, she  did not understand its character and did not suspect its source. Which  was a rather good thing--for the husband. Family peace was more  secure.    =Present Exaggerations.= Now a change has taken place in this respect,  and, as is often the case with recent changes, the pendulum has swung  to the other extreme. The silence of former days has given place to  shouting from the housetops. The last phrase is also used almost in  its literal sense. Many men and women, deeply stirred by the venereal  peril, and sincerely anxious to guard boys and girls from venereal  infection, have been indulging in very reprehensible exaggerations.  Particularly lurid have been the exaggerations as to the prevalence of  the disease in the male sex, with its consequent disastrous effects on  married women. A statement made by a Dr. Noeggerath (a German  physician who practiced at the time in New York), nearly half a  century ago, to the effect that 80 per cent, of all men have gonorrhea  and that 90 per cent. of these remain uncured and infect or are apt to  infect their wives, has been shown to be a ridiculously absurd  exaggeration. If it had been true, the race would now be at the point  of dying out. Nevertheless, this statement is copied from book to  book, as if it were gospel truth, as if it were a scientifically and  statistically established fact instead of a wild, sensational guess.  An esteemed New York physician, Dr. Prince A. Morrow, did excellent  pioneer work in calling attention to the dangers of venereal disease.  But, as is the case with so many \"reformers,\" he permitted his zeal to  run away with him occasionally, and he made statements which caused  and are still causing the judicious to grieve. The statement, for  instance, that there is more venereal disease among innocent, virtuous  wives than among prostitutes is one to cause the real honest  investigator to weep (over the human tendency to exaggeration), or to  burst out in uproarious laughter. The ridiculousness of this statement  becomes especially evident when we recollect that the same gentleman  made the statement that every prostitute, without exception, was  diseased at one time or another. If venereal disease exists among  prostitutes to the extent of 100 per cent., then how can it exist to a  greater extent among innocent, virtuous wives? And to still further  emphasize the absurdity of the above statement, I will tell you that  the extent of venereal disease among married women is believed by  careful non-sensational venereologists not to exceed five per cent.!    Yes, the silence of former years has given place to the lurid  exaggeration of the present day. While on the whole the former was  worse than the latter, the latter is bad enough, because it makes many"]]]
