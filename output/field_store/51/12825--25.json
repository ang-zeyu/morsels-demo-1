He declared that the bodily fatigue, the  mental fatigue, and the anxiety as to the result, made reading for a  class a thing not to be undergone more than once in a lifetime. Time had  mightier fatigues in store for him than even this. The heavy work among  the ideas of men of bygone days did not deaden intellectual projects of  his own. A few days before he went to see the Lords throw out the Reform  bill, he made a curious entry:--         _October 3rd, 1831._--Yesterday an idea, a chimera, entered my       head, of gathering during the progress of my life, notes and       materials for a work embracing three divisions, Morals, Politics,       Education, and I commit this notice to paper now, that many years       hence, if it please God, I may find it either a pleasant or at       least an instructive reminiscence, a pleasant and instructing one,       I trust, if I may ever be permitted to execute this design;       instructive if it shall point while in embryo, and serve to teach       me the folly of presumptuous schemes conceived during the buoyancy       of youth, and only relinquished on a discovery of incompetency in       later years. Meanwhile I am only contemplating the gradual       accumulation of materials.    The reading went on at a steady pace, not without social  intermissions:--         _Oct. 11th and 12th._--Rode. Papers. Virgil. Thucydides, both       days. Also some optics. Wrote a long letter home. Read a chapter of       Butler each day. Hume. Breakfasted also with Canning to meet Lady       C[anning]. She received us, I thought, with great kindness, and       spoke a great deal about Lord Grey's conduct with reference to her       husband's memory, with great animation and excitement; her hand in       a strong tremor. It was impossible not to enter into her feelings.    Then comes the struggle for the palm:--         _Monday, November 7th to Saturday 12th._--In the schools or       preparing. Read most of Niebuhr. Finished going over the       _Agamemnon_. Got up Aristophanic and other hard words. Went over my       books of extracts, etc. Read some of Whately's rhetoric. Got up a       little Polybius, and the history out of Livy, decade one. In the       schools Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; each day about six and a       half hours at work or under. First Stratford's speech into Latin       with logical and rhetorical questions--the latter somewhat       abstract. Dined at Gaskell's and met Pearson, a clever and       agreeable man. On Thursday a piece of Johnson's preface in morning,       in evening critical questions which I did very badly, but I       afterwards heard, better than _the rest_, which I could not and       cannot understand. On Friday we had in the morning historical       questions. Wrote a vast quantity of matter, ill enough digested. In       the evening, Greek to translate and illustrate. Heard cheering       accounts indirectly of myself, for which I ought to be very       thankful.... Dined with Pearson at the Mitre. Very kind in him to       ask me. Made Saturday in great measure an idle day. Had a good ride       with Gaskell. Spent part of the evening with him. Read about six       hours. _Sunday, November 13th._--Chapel thrice. Breakfast and       much conversation with Cameron. Read Bible. Some divinity of a       character approaching to cram. Looked over my shorter abstract of       Butler. Tea with Harrison. Walk with Gaskell. Wine with Hamilton,       more of a party than I quite liked or expected. Altogether my mind       was in an unsatisfactory state, though I heard a most admirable       sermon from Tyler on Bethesda, which could not have been more       opportune if written on purpose for those who are going into the       schools. But I am cold, timid, and worldly, and not in a healthy       state of mind for the great trial of to-morrow, to which I know I       am utterly and miserably unequal, but which I also know will be       sealed for good....    Here is his picture of his _viva voce_ examination:--         _November 14th._--Spent the morning chiefly in looking over my       Polybius; short abstract of ethics, and definitions. Also some hard       words. Went into the schools at ten, and from this time was little       troubled with fear. Examined by Stocker in divinity. I did not       answer as I could have wished. Hampden [the famous heresiarch] in       science, a beautiful examination, and with every circumstance in my       favour. He said to me, 'Thank you, you have construed extremely       well, and appear to be thoroughly acquainted with your books,' or       something to that effect. Then followed a very clever examination       in history from Garbett, and an agreeable and short one in my poets       from Cremer, who spoke very kindly to me at the close. I was only       put on in eight books besides the Testament, namely Rhetoric,       Ethics, _Phaedo_, Herodotus, Thucydides, _Odyssey_, Aristophanes       (_Vespae_), and Persius. Everything was in my favour; the examiners       kind beyond everything; a good many persons there, and all       friendly. At the end of the science, of course, my spirits were       much raised, and I could not help at that moment [giving thanks] to       Him without whom not even such moderate performances would have       been in my power. Afterwards rode to Cuddesdon with the Denisons,       and wrote home with exquisite pleasure.                            HIS DOUBLE FIRST CLASS    I have read a story by some contemporary how all attempts to puzzle him  by questions on the minutest details of Herodotus only brought out his  knowledge more fully; how the excitement reached its climax when the  examiner, after testing his mastery of some point of theology, said: 'We  will now leave that part of the subject,' and the candidate, carried  away by his interest in the subject, answered: 'No, sir; if you please,  we will not leave it yet,' and began to pour forth a fresh stream. Ten  days later, after a morning much disturbed and excited he rode in the  afternoon, and by half-past four the list was out, with Gladstone and  Denison both of them in the first class; Phillimore and Maurice in the  second; Herbert in the fourth.    Then mathematics were to come. The interval between the two schools he  passed at Cuddesdon, working some ten hours a day at his hardest, riding  every day with Denison, and all of them in high spirits. But optics,  algebra, geometry, calculus, trigonometry, and the rest, filled him with  misgivings for the future. 'Every day I read, I am more and more  thoroughly convinced of my incapacity for the subject.' 'My work  continued and my reluctance to exertion increased with it.' For the  Sunday before the examination, this is the entry, and a characteristic  and remarkable one it is:--'Teaching in the school morning and evening.  Saunders preached well on \"Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\" Read Bible  and four of Horsley's sermons. Paid visits to old people.'    On December 10th the mathematical ordeal began, and lasted four days.  The doctor gave him draughts to quiet his excitement. Better than  draughts, he read Wordsworth every day. On Sunday (December 11th) he  went, as usual, twice to chapel, and heard Newman preach 'a most able  discourse of a very philosophical character, more apt for reading than  for hearing--at least I, in the jaded state of my mind, was unable to do  it any justice.' On December 14th, the list was out, and his name was  again in the first class, again along with Denison. As everybody knows,  Peel had won a double-first twenty-three years before, and in  mathematics Peel had the first class to himself. Mr. Gladstone in each  of the two schools was one of five. Anstice, whose counsels and example  he counted for so much at one epoch in his collegiate life, in 1830  carried off the same double crown, and was, like Peel, alone in the  mathematical first class.         It was an hour of thrilling happiness, between the past and the       future, for the future was, I hope, not excluded; and feeling was       well kept in check by the bustle of preparation for speedy       departure. Saw the Dean, Biscoe, Saunders (whom I thanked for his       extreme kindness), and such of my friends as were in Oxford; all       most warm. The mutual hand-shaking between Denison, Jeffreys, and       myself, was very hearty. Wine with Bruce.... Packed up my       things.... Wrote at more or less length to Mrs. G. [his mother],       Gaskell, Phillimore, Mr. Denison, my old tutor Knapp.... Left       Oxford on the Champion.         _December 15th._--After finding the first practicable coach to       Cambridge was just able to manage breakfast in Bedford Square. Left       Holborn at ten, in Cambridge before five.    Here he was received by Wordsworth, the master of Trinity, and father of  his Oxford tutor. He had a visit full of the peculiar excitement and  felicity that those who are capable of it know nowhere else than at  Oxford and Cambridge. He heard Hallam recite his declamation; was  introduced to the mighty Whewell, to Spedding, the great Baconian, to  Smyth, the professor of history, to Blakesley; renewed his acquaintance  with the elder Hallam; listened to glorious anthems at Trinity and  King's; tried to hear a sermon from Simeon, the head of the English  evangelicals; met Stanhope, an old Eton man, and the two sons of Lord  Grey; and 'copied a letter of Mr. Pitt's.' From Cambridge he made his  way home, having thus triumphantly achieved the first stage of his long  life journey. Amid the manifold mutations of his career, to Oxford his  affection was passionate as it was constant. 'There is not a man that  has passed through that great and famous university that can say with  more truth than I can say, I love her from the bottom of my heart.'[52]                                        VI                   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#19)"],[1," run perilously near neglect.    \"I look a nasty, horrid, hidjus fright!\" she cried aloud, staring in  disgust at the unwelcome vision.  \"I couldn't have believed it--really I  couldn't!  It's the fault of those horrid little cubicles with the glass  stuck in the darkest corner.  Harold was right.  Mother would have been  shocked.\"    She slipped off coat and hat, and with the aid of the well-stocked  dressing-bag went through such a process of dusting, brushing, and  combing-out as she had not known for weeks past.  Finally the old Rhoda  seemed to smile upon her in response, in her own eyes at least, but when  Erley Chase was reached some hours later Mrs Chester was far from  satisfied with her darling's appearance.  Her anxious eyes took in at a  glance every change in the beloved features, and nothing could shake her  conviction that the child had been starved and overworked.  An elaborate  system of coddling was inaugurated, to which Rhoda submitted with  wonderful meekness.    Oh, the delight at being home again, of being loved and fussed over, and  indulged in one's pet little weaknesses!  How beautiful everything  looked; the richly-furnished rooms, the hall with its Turkey carpet and  pictured walls; the dinner table with its glittering glass and silver!  How luxurious to awake in her own pretty room, to hear the fire  crackling in the grate, and to sit up in bed to drink the early cup of  tea!    \"I never realised before how nice home was!\" sighed Rhoda to herself,  and for four whole days she succeeded in forgetting all about school,  and in abandoning herself to the enjoyment of the festivities of the  season.    Christmas Day once over, however, recollections came back with a pang,  and she was all eagerness to begin the proposed lessons with the Vicar.  To her surprise, father and mother looked coldly upon the project, and  so far from admiring her industry thought it a pity to introduce work  into the holidays.  It needed a hard struggle to induce them to consent  to three lessons a week instead of six, and she had to face the  certainty that private study would be made as difficult as possible.  Even Harold elevated his eyebrows and enquired, \"Why this tremendous  hurry?\" as if he had never been to a public school himself and known the  necessity for advance.    Rhoda betook herself to the faithful Ella in no very gentle mood, and  stormed about the small Vicarage garden like a young whirlwind.    \"Well, I must say grown-ups are the most tiresome, aggravating,  unreasonable creatures that were ever invented!  First they want you to  work, and urge you to work, and goad you to work, and `Oh, my dear, it  would do you all the good in the world to compete with other girls,' and  then, the moment you take them at their word and get interested and  eager, round they turn, and it's, `Oh the folly of cram!  Oh the  importance of health!'  `Oh what does it matter, my dear good child, if  you _are_ a dunce, so long as you keep your complexion!'  No, I'm not  angry, I'm perfectly calm, but it makes me _ill_!  I can't stand being  thwarted in my best and noblest ambitions.  If I had a daughter, and she  wanted to cram in her holidays, I'd be proud of her, and try to help,  instead of throwing hindrances in the way.  It's very hard, I must say,  to get no sympathy from one's nearest and dearest.  Even your father  looked at me over his spectacles as if I were a wild animal.  I thought  he would have been pleased with my industry.\"    \"He is; I know he is; but he thinks you may overdo it.  You know, Rhoda,  you _are_ impetuous!  When you take up an idea you ride it to death, and  in lessons that doesn't pay.  Slow and sure wins the--\"    \"Rubbish!  Humbug!  It will never win my race, for I have a definite  time to run it in, and not a day more.  It has to be a gallop, and a  pretty stiff one at that.  For goodness' sake, Ella, don't _you_ begin  to preach.  You might be grown-up yourself, sitting there prosing in  that horribly well-regulated fashion.\"    \"I'm not well-regulated!\" cried Ella, incensed by the insinuation.  \"I  was only trying to calm you down because you were in such a temper.  What is the use of worrying?  You have got your own way; why can't you  be happy?  Leave the wretched old Latin alone, and tell me about school.  There are a hundred things I am longing to hear, and we have not had a  proper talk yet.  Tell me about the girls, and the teachers, and the  rules, and the amusements, and what you like best, and what you hate  worst.\"    It was a \"large order,\" as Harold would have said, but Rhoda responded  with enjoyment, for what can be pleasanter than to expatiate on one's  own doings to a hearer with sufficient knowledge to appreciate the  points, and sufficient ignorance to prevent criticism or undue  sensitiveness as to consistency of detail!    Rhoda told of the chill, early breakfasts, of the seven o'clock supper  when everything looked so different in the rosy light, especially on  Thursdays, when frolics and best clothes were the order of the day; of  Miss Mott, with her everlasting \"Attention to the board\"; the Latin  mistress, with her eye-glasses; Fraulein, with a voice described by Tom  as sounding \"like a gutter on a rainy day\"; and of Miss Everett,  sweetest and best-loved of all.  Lastly she told of the Record Wall, and  Ella was fired, as every girl hearer invariably was fired, with interest  and emulation.    When Rhoda went off to her lesson in the study the poor little stay-at-  home recalled the words of Eleanor Newman's inscription, and capped them  by one even more touching:    \"Ella Mason, a student of exceptional promise, voluntarily relinquished  a career of fame and glory to be a cheerful and uncomplaining helper at  home.\"  Alas, poor Ella! at the word \"cheerful\" her lips twitched, and  at \"uncomplaining\" the big tears arose and trickled down her cheeks!    For the rest of the holidays Rhoda worked more persistently than anyone  suspected, with the exception of her tutor, who invariably found the  allotted task not only perfectly accomplished, but exceeded in length.  Even making allowances for the girl's undoubted gift for languages, he  was amazed at her progress, and complimented her warmly at the close of  the lessons, watching with half-amused, half-pitying eyes the flush of  pleasure on the girl's cheeks.    \"You are very ambitious, Rhoda.  Very anxious to distinguish yourself?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, well! you are young.  It is natural.  Remember only that there  are different kinds of success, and aim for the best.  When I was your  age I had dreams of a deanery or a bishopric, but I have remained all my  life in this sleepy village.  My college companions have soared over my  head, yet I can never feel myself an unsuccessful man.  I have had great  compensations, and have discovered that obscurity has many lessons which  I needed badly to learn.  Don't be too anxious for honour and glory;  there are other things better worth having!\"    \"The worst of old people is--they _will_ preach!\" said Rhoda to herself  as she walked home across the Park.  \"He is a good old thing, the Vicar,  but a terrible bore.  Unsuccessful!  I should think he _is_  unsuccessful, with half-a-dozen children, and that wretched little bit  of a house, and a poor stipend.  No wonder he gets prosy.  Young people  understand young people best, and Miss Everett was quite right when she  said it was no use trying to stuff lessons down your throat until you  were ready to swallow them.  If all the fathers, and mothers, and  brothers, and vicars in the world were to lecture me now, and tell me to  take it easy, and not to worry about the examination, it would have no  effect.  In another two days I go back to school, and then--then--\" She  stood still in the midst of the bare, wintry scene, and clasped her  hands together passionately.    \"Rhoda Chester, you must work, you must win!  If you don't do well in  that examination, it will break your heart!\"        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    \"IF I PASS--\"    The Christmas holidays were over, the Easter holidays were over, and  spring was back once more.  On the slope over which the new students had  gaily tobogganed two months before the primroses were showing their  dainty, yellow faces, and the girl gardeners were eagerly watching the  progress of their bulbs.  Hearing that other plots boasted nothing rarer  than pheasant eye and Lent lilies, Rhoda had promptly written home for a  supply of Horsfieldi and Emperor, which were expected to put everything  else in the shade, but, alas! they were coming up in feeble fashion, and  showed little sign of flowering.  \"Another year,\" the gardener said,  \"they would do better another year!  Bulbs were never so strong the  first season.\"  Whereat Rhoda chafed with impatience.  Always another  time, and not _now_!    Always postponement, delay, uncertainty!  Try as she might, checks  seemed to be waiting on every side, and she could never succeed in  distinguishing herself above her fellows.  In moments of depression it  seemed that she was as insignificant now as on the day when she first  joined the school; but at other times she was happily conscious of a  change in the mental attitude towards herself.  Though still far from  the front, she was recognised as a girl of power and determination; an  ambitious girl, who would spare no work to attain her end, and who  might, in the future, become a dangerous rival.  Dorothy had long ago  thrown up the unequal fight, and even Kathleen had moments of doubt,  when she said fearfully to herself, \"She is cleverer than I am.  She  gets on so well.  Suppose--just suppose...\"    With milder weather, cricket had come into fashion, and on the occasion  of the first pavilion tea the Blues turned up in force.  Thomasina sat  perched in manly attitude on the corner of the table, where, as it  seemed to the onlooker, every possible hindrance was put in the way of  her"]]]
