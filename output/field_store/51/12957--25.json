These steamships carry it to Seattle, or to Vancouver, whence it  is distributed by rail. The increased cost of shipment by this route is  more than offset by a gain of from five to seven days in time.    In some respects the Russian \"caravan route\" is the most important  channel of the tea-trade. The tea is collected mainly at Tientsin, and  sent by camel caravans through Manchuria to the most convenient point on  the Siberian railway. Not only the shipments of brick tea[36] for the  Russian market, but the choicest products for western Europe also are  sent by this route. It is probably an economical way of shipping the  brick tea, but a more expensive method of shipment for the latter could  not be found easily; it is preferred from the fact that, no matter how  carefully sealed, the flavor of tea is materially injured by an ocean  voyage.    It is evident, therefore, that for the tea product alone the Siberian  railway will soon become an important factor in the commerce of Europe.  Shipments of tea are also sent from Canton to Odessa, Russia, but this  route is not less expensive in the long run than the Cape route, and the  tea suffers as much deterioration from the shorter as from the longer  voyage.    =Cacao.=--Cacao, the \"cocoa\" of commerce, consists of the prepared seeds  of several species of _Theobroma_, the greater part being obtained from  the _Theobroma cacao_. The name is unfortunately confused with that of  the cocoa-palm, but there is no relation whatever between the two.    The seeds of the cacao were used in ancient America long before its  discovery by Columbus, and the latter carried the first knowledge of it  to Europe. By the middle of the seventeenth century it was much used in  Spain, and less than a hundred years later it had become the fashionable  drink of western Europe.    The cacao-tree, originally native to Mexico, is now cultivated  throughout tropical America and the West Indies. It is not cultivated to  any extent in the Eastern continent. The fruit consists of large, fleshy  pods, which are cut from the trees usually in June and December. The  seeds are then piled in heaps, or else packed in pits, and allowed to  undergo a rapid fermentation for a period of several days, to which  process their flavor is mainly due. The roasted and broken seeds are the  cocoa-nibs of commerce. The husks are known as cocoa-shells.    A very large part of the cacao product comes from Ecuador, Guayaquil  being perhaps the chief market of the world. The Venezuelan and  Brazilian products, however, are the choicest; these are known in  commerce respectively as Caracas and Trinidad cacao. Spain, Portugal,  and France are the chief purchasers, and in the first-named country the  consumption per person is five or six times as great as in other  countries.    Cacao is not only a stimulant beverage, but a food as well; about  one-half its weight is fat, and about one-third consists of starch and  flesh-making substances. The stimulant principle is the same as that  occurring in tea and coffee, but the proportion is considerably less. In  preparing the cocoa for the market, much of the fat is intentionally  withdrawn. The fat, commercially known as \"cocoa-butter,\" and \"oil of  theobroma,\" does not turn rancid.    Chocolate consists of cocoa ground to a paste with sugar and flavoring  matter, and then cast in moulds to harden. It is used mainly in the  manufacture of confectionery. Most of the chocolate is made in France,  Spain, and the United States. More than forty million pounds of cocoa  are yearly consumed in the United States.    =Mate.=--Mate, yerba mate, or Paraguay tea, is the leaf of a shrub, a  species of holly, growing profusely in the forests of Brazil, Paraguay,  Argentina, and Uruguay. In many instances, the shrub is cultivated. The  leaves are prepared in much the same manner as tea-leaves are, but  instead of being rolled, they are broken by beating.    The mate of commerce has a stimulant principle identical with that of  tea and coffee, which is the only reason for its use. The consumption,  about fifteen thousand tons a year, is confined almost wholly to the  countries named.    =Tobacco.=--The tobacco of commerce is the prepared and manufactured leaf  of several species of plant, belonging to the nightshade family. Most of  the product is derived from the species known as Virginia tobacco  (_Nicotiana tabacum_) and the Brazilian species (_Nicotiana rustica_).  The former is cultivated in the United States, West Indies, the  Philippine Islands, and Turkey; the latter has been transplanted to  central Europe and the East Indies.    The use of tobacco was prevalent in the New World at the time of  Columbus's first voyage, and was quickly introduced into Europe. The  prepared leaf contains a substance, nicotine, which is one of the most  deadly of poisons when swallowed, and an intense narcotic stimulant when  inhaled. On account of the evil effects arising from its introduction,  its use was forbidden by the Church and also by sovereigns of several  European states. The latter, however, finding that its use was becoming  general, made it a Crown monopoly. In Great Britain its cultivation was  forbidden in order to encourage its cultivation in Virginia.    Tobacco does not thrive best in a poor soil, but the latter produces a  thin, half-developed leaf, which in other plants would be called  \"sickly.\" It grows in almost any kind of soil, but requires warm summer  nights. In many instances the tobacco of temperate latitudes yields a  more salable leaf when grown under cover. The flavor is due partly to  soil and climate, and partly to skill in curing. The choicest product is  obtained in only a few localities of limited area. It sometimes happens  that the products of two plantations almost side by side, and similarly  situated, are very unlike in character and quality.    [Illustration: TOBACCO]    The choicest cigar-tobacco is grown on the Vuelta Abajo district in the  province of Pinar del Rio, Cuba; another very choice Cuban leaf is known  as Partidos. Cuban-made cigars of fine quality are commercially \"Havana\"  cigars, although tobacco from Manila and Porto Rico is apt to be largely  used in their manufacture. In order to avoid the very heavy duty on  cigars, which is not far from six dollars per pound, a great deal of the  Havana tobacco is exported to points along the Florida coast, mainly Key  West and Tampa. The unmanufactured tobacco pays a comparatively small  duty, and the cigars made from it are commercially known as \"Key West.\"    In some parts of Mexico a fine-flavored tobacco is grown, but as the  cigars are not uniform in quality they are not popular. Some of the  Brazilian tobacco is a high-class product, but not much is exported.  Porto Rican leaf has a fine flavor, but is not popular because of its  dark color. The demand for it in the United States is growing, however.  Of the leaf grown in the East, that from Sumatra and the Philippine  Islands is by far the best, and the exports are heavy. Cuban  manufacturers purchase the Manila leaf; the Sumatra wrappers are  purchased in the United States.    The choicest cigarette-tobacco is grown in Asiatic Turkey,  Transcaucasia, and Egypt. It is selected with great care, and is  \"long-cut.\" The common grades are made of chopped Virginia tobacco, or  of chopped cigar-trimmings. The cheapest grades consist of refuse leaf  mixed with half-smoked cigar-stumps. The United States leads in the  manufacture of cigarettes, and a large part of the product is sold in  China, India, and Japan. Most of the world's product of snuff is made in  the United States, and nearly all of it is sold abroad.    The United States produces yearly about seven hundred million pounds. A  large part of this is sold to European countries. Great Britain  purchases about four-fifths of the tobacco there consumed from the  United States. The latter country purchases from Europe (mainly the  Netherlands) about half as much as it sells to Europe. Louisville, Ky.,  is probably the largest tobacco-market in the world. New York,  Baltimore, Richmond, Manila, and Havana are the chief shipping-ports.    In almost every civilized country tobacco is heavily taxed. In the  United States there is not only a heavy import duty, but an internal  revenue in addition. In Austria, France, Italy, Japan, and Spain the  manufacture and sale is in the hands of the government. The consumption  of tobacco varies greatly. In the Netherlands it averages about seven  pounds a year to each individual; in the United States it is more than  four pounds; in central Europe, three pounds; in Spain, Sweden, Great  Britain, and Italy, it is less than two pounds.    =Opium.=--The opium of commerce is the hardened juice obtained from the  seed capsules of several species of the poppy-plant. A variety having a  large capsule (_Papaver somniferum_) is most commonly cultivated for the  commercial production of the substance. Half-a-dozen times during the  season the capsules are scratched or cut; the juice exuding when hard is  picked or scraped off and pressed into cakes.    Opium is not only a narcotic poison, but it has the property of  lessening the pain of disease, and this is its chief use in medicine. In  Mohammedan countries where the use of alcoholic liquors is forbidden as  a religious custom, opium is used as a substitute. In Turkey, Persia,  Arabia, and Egypt the production of opium is an important industry  connected with social and religious life. In British India it is a  political factor, being extensively cultivated as a government monopoly  to be sold to the Chinese, who are probably the chief consumers of it.  The Indian Government derives a revenue sometimes reaching twenty  million dollars from this source.

Turning back now to the south, we  traversed the plain towards the base of Sinai. The wady grew gently  narrower as we approached Neja, whose base projected far into the plain,  and whose head shuts off the view of Sinai for a distance of about  one-half the width of the plain at its base.    \"'As we passed its foot, Sinai again appeared, and we measured the plain  near the pathway which leads up towards Sinai on the southern border of  Neja, and which appears to be the only entrance to the Holy Mountain.  The measured width here was four hundred and thirty feet. Passing on  three hundred and forty-five paces, we arrived at the narrowest part of  the plain, some few yards narrower than where we had measured it. This  may be considered as an entrance-door to the plain, which lies directly  in front of Sinai, which now spreads out level, clear, and broad, going  on to the south with varied widths for about three miles on gently  ascending ground, where it passes between two sloping hills and enters  another wady which descends beyond, from which it is most probable Sinai  may yet be clearly seen.    \"'On the east, this plain of Sebaiyeh is bounded by mountains having  long, sloping bases, and covered with wild thyme and other herbs,  affording a good tenting-ground immediately fronting Sinai, which forms,  as it were, a grand pyramidal pulpit to the magnificent amphitheatre  below. The width of the plain immediately in front of Sinai is about  1600 feet, but further south the width is much increased, so that on an  average the plain may be considered as being nearly one-third of a mile  wide, and its length, in view of Mount Sinai, between five and six  miles. The good tenting-ground on the mountain sides mentioned above,  would give much more space for the multitude on the great occasion for  which they were assembled. This estimate does not include that part of  the plain to the north, and Wady esh-Sheikh, from which the peak of  Sinai is not visible; for this space would contain three or four times  the number of people which Sebaiyeh would hold.    \"'From Wady Sebaiyeh we crossed over the granite spurs, in order to pass  around the southern border of Sinai into Wady Lejah. These spurs are of  sufficient size to have separate names among the Arabs. Around them were  generally deep and rugged gorges and ravines, or water-courses, whose  sides were formed of ledges of granite nearly perpendicular, of a pink  color, and fine texture. There are no _gravel_ hills, as mentioned by  Dr. Robinson, but a series of low granite hills, much broken up, and of  different colors, principally of a greenish-gray and brown. The plain is  covered with a fine _debris_ of granite. Whilst crossing over these low  hills, my friend pointed out the path between them and Sinai, in the  ravine, through which he had passed yesterday on his return from St.  Catharine; and it was seen that no plain would be visible from any part  of it, owing to the height of the spurs which separated the ravine from  Sebaiyeh, and we concluded that most travellers had been led into false  views concerning this part of the mountain from having taken the same  path, and hence it was that no account has been given respecting the  plain of Sebaiyeh. This ravine around Sinai becomes a deep impassable  gorge, with perpendicular walls, as it enters Wady Lejah, passing  through the high neck connecting with the mountain on the south.    \"'Descending into Lejah, under the rocky precipice of Sinai, we found  the wady narrow and choked up with huge blocks of granite which had  tumbled from the sides of the adjacent mountains. We could now see the  olive-ground of the deserted convent of _el-Arbain_, situated in the  bottom of the narrow valley. Passing through this garden, we found a  fine running stream of crystal water, of which we partook freely, for  our thirst was great. The garden was walled, and well irrigated by many  small canals, but nothing seemed to flourish but the olive.    \"'Continuing down the valley, amidst loose rocks of granite, upon some  of which were inscriptions in the Sinaite, Greek, and Arabic characters,  and enjoying the wildness of the scene, and the gloomy grandeur of the  lofty mountains of naked rocks which almost overhung our path, we saw  Horeb on our right, and soon entered upon the plain before it called  _Wady Rahah_. After taking a view of Horeb as the sun was setting, we  made our way to the convent, to pass the night within its hospitable  walls. Thus was completed a walk around the whole mountain of Sinai.    \"'The results of these investigations, together with the information  afforded by Burckhardt and other travellers, have served to convince my  own mind that this district is every way adapted to the circumstances  attending the encampment of the Israelites during the promulgation of  the law upon Mount Sinai Though other mountains in this vicinity may  answer as well as that of Jebel Musa for this great purpose, still I  cannot see any good reason for taking from this mountain that holy  character with which tradition has invested it for the last fifteen  centuries.'    \"Thus,\" says Dr. Kitto, \"it seems that the question as to the  camping-ground of the Israelites, which seemed to have been settled by  the researches of Dr. Robinson and others, must now be regarded as  re-opened for further investigations. The fact is, that a complete and  careful survey of the whole of this central mountain region yet remains  to be taken.\"    The friend of Mr. Kellogg alluded to in the preceding pages was an  English gentleman, Mr. Ackanth, (of the East India Service,) whose notes  will amply vindicate Mr. Kellogg's conclusions.    FOOTNOTES:    [F] The _Literary World_ at that period was edited by the able, candid,  and universally beloved C.F. Hoffman.--(Ed. Int.)    [G] \"The writer seems not to have been aware that this still leaves the  priority to Laborde--whose journey was undertaken even earlier than that  of Robinson, and whose really valuable work, _Commentaire Geographique  sur l'Exode et les Nombres_, which now lies before us, was _published_  in the very year of Mr. Kellogg's journey, 1844. This work certainly  forms the best _literary_ result of Laborde's celebrated journey.\"          LAFAYETTE, TALLEYRAND, METTERNICH, AND NAPOLEON.    Sketched By Lord Holland.[H]      Lord Holland, says the _Examiner_, has been induced by \"the recent  events on the Continent\" to publish what his father had written on  foreign politics. \"If not wholly impartial,\" the present Lord Holland  remarks of his father, \"he is acknowledged by all who knew him to have  been as candid as he was benevolent.\" He might have said more than  this--indeed far more than it might have been quite becoming in a son to  say. The late Lord Holland was a noble example of the highest and best  traits of the English character. Throughout his public life he was the  champion of all just causes; the friend of all who fairly sought  redress; the fearless advocate of liberty, religious and civil, in days  disastrous to both; a statesman of singular courage and consistency, a  most accomplished gentleman and scholar. He had learning without  pedantry, and wit without ill-nature. His sweetness of temper and  fascinating grace of manner had been commemorated by many distinguished  men who had felt their winning potency and charm. But above all he had a  store of observation and anecdote of the richest kind, and a power of  applying it with surprising felicity to whatever subject might be under  discussion. This book is a delightful surviving proof of that quality in  his character. Its anecdotes are told with a charming ease and fulness  of knowledge. No one so quickly as Lord Holland detected the notable  points, whether of a book or a man, or turned them to such happy  account. We do not read a page of this volume without feeling that a  supreme master of that exquisite art is speaking to us. It comprises  recollections of the scenes and actors in the stirring drama which was  played out on the Continent between 1791 and 1815. It opens with the  death of Mirabeau and closes with the death of Napoleon. France,  Denmark, Prussia, and Spain are the countries principally treated of.  Lord Holland's first visit to France was in 1791, just after the death  of Mirabeau and the disastrous flight to Varennes. LAFAYETTE seems to  have been more disposed than any other public actor in the revolution to  put faith in the king even after that incident, and his confidence won  over the young English traveller. But the weakness as well as strength  of Lafayette is well hit off.    \"Lafayette was, however, then as always, a pure disinterested man, full  of private affection and public virtue, and not devoid of such talents  as firmness of purpose, sense of honor, and earnestness of zeal will, on  great occasions, supply. He was indeed accessible to flattery, somewhat  too credulous, and apt to mistake the forms, or, if I may so phrase it,  the pedantry of liberty for the substance, as if men could not enjoy any  freedom without subscribing to certain abstract principles and arbitrary  tests, or as if the profession and subscription, nay, the technical  observance of such tests and principles, were not, on the other hand,  often compatible with practical oppression and tyranny.\"    MARIE ANTOINETTE is treated almost as badly as by Mr. Geffeson, who  thought her a devil, far less tenderly than we should have expected. Her  \"amours\" are spoken of, though with the limitation that \"they were not  numerous, scandalous, or degrading.\" We gather that Talleyrand believed  her to have been guilty in a special instance named, and that Madame  Champan had confessed it to him.
