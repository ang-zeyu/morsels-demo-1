Her frail body stoops under the  weight of four-score years but her bright eyes and alert mind are those  of a woman thirty years younger. A blue-checked mob cap covers her  grizzled hair. Her tiny frame, clothed in a motley collection of  undergarments, dress, and sweaters, is adorned by a clean white apron.  Although a little shy of her strange white visitors, her innate dignity,  gentle courtesy, and complete self possession indicate long association  with \"quality folks.\"    Her speech shows a noticeable freedom from the usual heavy negro dialect  and idiom of the deep south. \"Yes, Ma'am, yes, Sir, come in. Pull a  chair to the fire. You'll have to 'scuse me. I can't get around much,  'cause my feet and legs bother me, but I got good eyes an' good ears an'  all my own teeth. I aint never had a bad tooth in my head. Yes'm, I'm  81, going on 82. Marster done wrote my age down in his book where he  kep' the names of all his colored folks. Muh (Mother) belonged to Dr.  Jones but Pappy belonged to Marse Israel Lash over yonder. (Pointing  northwest.) Younguns always went with their mammies so I belonged to the  Joneses.    \"Muh and Pappy could visit back and forth sometimes but they never lived  together 'til after freedom. Yes'm, we was happy. We got plenty to eat.  Marster and old Miss Julia (Dr. Jones' wife, matriarch of the whole  plantation) was mighty strict but they was good to us. Colored folks on  some of the other plantations wasn't so lucky. Some of' em had  overseers, mean, cruel men. On one plantation the field hands had to  hustle to git to the end of the row at eleven o'clock dinner-time  'cause when the cooks brought their dinner they had to stop just where  they was and eat, an' the sun was mighty hot out in those fields. They  only had ash cakes (corn pone baked in ashes) without salt, and molasses  for their dinner, but we had beans an' grits an' salt an' sometimes  meat.    \"I was lucky. Miss Ella (daughter of the first Beverly Jones) was a  little girl when I was borned and she claimed me. We played together an'  grew up together. I waited on her an' most times slept on the floor in  her room. Muh was cook an' when I done got big enough I helped to set  the table in the big dinin' room. Then I'd put on a clean white apron  an' carry in the victuals an' stand behind Miss Ella's chair. She'd fix  me a piece of somethin' from her plate an' hand it back over her  shoulder to me (eloquent hands illustrate Miss Ella's making of a  sandwich.) I'd take it an' run outside to eat it. Then I'd wipe my mouth  an' go back to stand behind Miss Ella again an' maybe get another snack.    \"Yes'm, there was a crowd of hands on the plantation. I mind 'em all an'  I can call most of their names. Mac, Curley, William, Sanford, Lewis,  Henry, Ed, Sylvester, Hamp, an' Juke was the men folks. The women was  Nellie, two Lucys, Martha, Nervie, Jane, Laura, Fannie, Lizzie, Cassie,  Tensie, Lindy, an' Mary Jane. The women mostly, worked in the house.  There was always two washwomen, a cook, some hands to help her, two  sewin' women, a house girl, an' some who did all the weavin' an'  spinnin'. The men worked in the fields an' yard. One was stable boss an'  looked after all the horses an' mules. We raised our own flax an'  cotton an' wool, spun the thread, wove the cloth, made all the clothes.  Yes'm, we made the mens' shirts an' pants an' coats. One woman knitted  all the stockin's for the white folks an' colored folks too. I mind she  had one finger all twisted an' stiff from holdin' her knittin' needles.  We wove the cotton an' linen for sheets an' pillow-slips an' table  covers. We wove the wool blankets too. I use to wait on the girl who did  the weavin' when she took the cloth off the loom she done give me the  'thrums' (ends of thread left on the loom.) I tied 'em all together with  teensy little knots an' got me some scraps from the sewin' room and I  made me some quilt tops. Some of 'em was real pretty too! (Pride of  workmanship evidenced by a toss of Betty's head.)    \"All our spinnin' wheels and flax wheels and looms was hand-made by a  wheel wright, Marse Noah Westmoreland. He lived over yonder. (A thumb  indicates north.) Those old wheels are still in the family'. I got one  of the flax wheels. Miss Ella done give it to me for a present. Leather  was tanned an' shoes was made on the place. 'Course the hands mostly  went barefoot in warm weather, white chillen too. We had our own mill to  grind the wheat and corn an' we raised all our meat. We made our own  candles from tallow and beeswax. I 'spect some of the old candle moulds  are over to 'the house' now. We wove our own candle wicks too. I never  saw a match 'til I was a grown woman. We made our fire with flint an'  punk (rotten wood). Yes'm, I was trained to cook an' clean an' sew. I  learned to make mens' pants an' coats. First coat I made, Miss Julia  told me to rip the collar off, an' by the time I picked out all the  teensy stitches an' sewed it together again I could set a collar right!  I can do it today, too! (Again there is manifested a good workman's  pardonable pride of achievement)    \"Miss Julia cut out all the clothes herself for men and women too. I  'spect her big shears an' patterns an' old cuttin' table are over at the  house now. Miss Julia cut out all the clothes an' then the colored girls  sewed 'em up but she looked 'em all over and they better be sewed right!  Miss Julia bossed the whole plantation. She looked after the sick folks  and sent the doctor (Dr. Jones) to dose 'em and she carried the keys to  the store-rooms and pantries. [HW: paragraph mark here.] Yes'm, I'm  some educated. Muh showed me my 'a-b-abs' and my numbers and when I was  fifteen I went to school in the log church built by the Moravians. They  give it to the colored folks to use for their own school and church.  (This log house is still standing near Bethania). Our teacher was a  white man, Marse Fulk. He had one eye, done lost the other in the war.  We didn't have no colored teachers then. They wasn't educated. We  'tended school four months a year. I went through the fifth reader, the  'North Carolina Reader'. I can figger a little an' read some but I can't  write much 'cause my fingers 're--all stiffened up. Miss Julia use to  read the bible to us an' tell us right an' wrong, and Muh showed me all  she could an' so did the other colored folks. Mostly they was kind to  each other.    \"No'm, I don't know much about spells an' charms. Course most of the  old folks believed in 'em. One colored man use to make charms, little  bags filled with queer things. He called 'em 'jacks' an' sold 'em to the  colored folks an' some white folks too.    \"Yes'm, I saw some slaves sold away from the plantation, four men and  two women, both of 'em with little babies. The traders got 'em. Sold 'em  down to Mobile, Alabama. One was my pappy's sister. We never heard from  her again. I saw a likely young feller sold for $1500. That was my Uncle  Ike. Marse Jonathan Spease bought him and kept him the rest of his life.    \"Yes'm, we saw Yankee soldiers. (Stoneman's Cavalry in 1865.) They come  marchin' by and stopped at 'the house. I wasn't scared 'cause they was  all talkin' and laughin' and friendly but they sure was hongry. They  dumped the wet clothes out of the big wash-pot in the yard and filled it  with water. Then they broke into the smokehouse and got a lot of hams  and biled 'em in the pot and ate 'em right there in the yard. The women  cooked up a lot of corn pone for 'em and coffee too. Marster had a  barrel of 'likker' put by an' the Yankees knocked the head in an' filled  their canteens. There wasn't ary drop left. When we heard the soldiers  comin' our boys turned the horses loose in the woods. The Yankees said  they had to have 'em an' would burn the house down if we didn't get 'em.  So our boys whistled up the horses an' the soldiers carried 'em all off.  They carried off ol' Jennie mule too but let little Jack mule go. When  the soldiers was gone the stable boss said,'if ol' Jennie mule once gits  loose nobody on earth can catch her unless she wants. She'll be back!'  Sure enough, in a couple of days she come home by herself an' we worked  the farm jus' with her an' little Jack.    \"Some of the colored folks followed the Yankees away. Five or six of our  boys went. Two of 'em travelled as far as Yadkinville but come back. The  rest of 'em kep' goin' an' we never heard tell of' em again.    \"Yes'm, when we was freed Pappy come to get Muh and me. We stayed around  here. Where could we go? These was our folks and I couldn't go far away  from Miss Ella. We moved out near Rural Hall (some 5 miles from  Bethania) an' Pappy farmed, but I worked at the home place a lot. When I  was about twenty-four Marse R. J. Reynolds come from Virginia an' set up  a tobacco factory. He fotched some hands with 'im. One was a likely  young feller, named Cofer, from Patrick County, Virginia. I liked 'im  an' we got married an' moved back here to my folks.(the Jones family) We  started to buy our little place an' raise a family. I done had four  chillen but two's dead. I got grandchillen and great-grandchillen close  by. This is home to us. When we talk about the old home place (the Jones  residence, now some hundred years old) we just say 'the house' 'cause  there's only one house to us. The rest of the family was all fine folks  and good to me but I loved Miss Ella better'n any one or anythin' else  in the world. She was the best friend I ever had. If I ever wanted for  anythin' I just asked her an she give it to me or got it for me somehow.  Once when Cofer was in his last sickness his sister come from East  Liverpool, Ohio, to see 'im. I went to Miss Ella to borrow a little  money. She didn't have no change but she just took a ten dollar bill  from her purse an' says 'Here you are, Betty, use what you need and  bring me what's left'.    \"I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22994"],[0,"The Frontier in American History (#19)"],[1," were frontiersmen about Great Creek, a  branch of the Roanoke.[94:3] The North Carolina commissioners desired to  stop running the line after going a hundred and seventy miles, on the  plea that they were already fifty miles beyond the outermost inhabitant,  and there would be no need for an age or two to carry the line farther;  but the Virginia surveyors pointed out that already speculators were  taking up the land. A line from Weldon to Fayetteville would roughly  mark the western boundary of North Carolina's sparse population of forty  thousand souls.[95:1]    The slower advance is explained, partly because of the later settlement  of the Carolinas, partly because the Indians continued to be troublesome  on the flanks of the advancing population, as seen in the Tuscarora and  Yemassee wars, and partly because the pine barrens running parallel with  the fall line made a zone of infertile land not attractive to settlers.  The North Carolina low country, indeed, had from the end of the  seventeenth century been a kind of southern frontier for overflow from  Virginia; and in many ways was assimilated to the type of the up-country  in its turbulent democracy, its variety of sects and peoples, and its  primitive conditions. But under the lax management of the public lands,  the use of \"blank patents\" and other evasions made possible the  development of large landholding, side by side with headrights to  settlers. Here, as in Virginia, a great proprietary grant extended  across the colony--Lord Granville's proprietary was a zone embracing the  northern half of North Carolina. Within the area, sales and quit-rents  were administered by the agents of the owner, with the result that  uncertainty and disorder of an agrarian nature extended down to the  Revolution. There were likewise great speculative holdings, conditioned  on seating a certain proportion of settlers, into which the frontiersmen  were drifting.[95:2] But this system also made it possible for agents of  later migrating congregations to establish colonies like that of the  Moravians at Wachovia.[95:3] Thus, by the time settlers came into the  uplands from the north, a land system existed similar to that of  Virginia. A common holding was a square mile (640 acres), but in  practice this did not prevent the accumulation of great estates.[96:1]  Whereas Virginia's Piedmont area was to a large extent entered by  extensions from the coast, that of North Carolina remained almost  untouched by 1730.[96:2]    The same is true of South Carolina. By 1730, settlement had progressed  hardly eighty miles from the coast, even in the settled area of the  lowlands. The tendency to engross the lowlands for large plantations was  clear, here as elsewhere.[96:3] The surveyor-general reports in 1732  that not as many as a thousand acres within a hundred miles of  Charleston, or within twenty miles of a river or navigable creek, were  unpossessed. In 1729 the crown ordered eleven townships of twenty  thousand acres each to be laid out in rectangles, divided into fifty  acres for each actual settler under a quit-rent of four shillings a year  for every hundred acres, or proportionally, to be paid after the first  ten years.[96:4] By 1732 these townships, designed to attract foreign  Protestants, were laid out on the great rivers of the colony. As they  were located in the middle region, east of the fall line, among pine  barrens, or in malarial lands in the southern corner of the colony, they  all proved abortive as towns, except Orangeburg[96:5] on the North  Edisto, where German redemptioners made a settlement. The Scotch-Irish  Presbyterians who came to Williamsburg, on Black River, suffered  hardships; as did the Swiss who, under the visionary leadership of  Purry, settled in the deadly climate of Purrysburg, on the lower  Savannah. To Welsh colonists from Pennsylvania there was made a  grant--known as the \"Welsh tract,\" embracing over 173,000 acres on the  Great Pedee (Marion County)[97:1] under headrights of fifty acres, also  a bounty in provisions, tools, and livestock.    These attempts, east of the fall line, are interesting as showing  the colonial policy of marking out towns (which were to be  politically-organized parishes, with representation in the legislature),  and attracting foreigners thereto, prior to the coming of settlers from  the North.    The settlement of Georgia, in 1732, completed the southern line of  colonization toward the Piedmont. Among the objects of the colony, as  specified in the charters, were the relief of the poor and the  protection of the frontiers. To guard against the tendency to engross  the lands in great estates, already so clearly revealed in the older  colonies, the Georgia trustees provided that the grants of fifty acres  should not be alienated or divided, but should pass to the male heirs  and revert to the trustees in case heirs were lacking. No grant greater  than five hundred acres was permitted, and even this was made  conditionally upon the holder settling ten colonists. However, under  local conditions and the competition and example of neighboring  colonies, this attempt to restrict land tenure in the interest of  democracy broke down by 1750, and Georgia's land system became not  unlike that of the other Southern colonies.[97:2]    In 1734, Salzburgers had been located above Savannah, and within seven  years some twelve hundred German Protestants were dwelling on the  Georgia frontier; while a settlement of Scotch Highlanders at Darien,  near the mouth of the Altamaha, protected the southern frontier. At  Augusta, an Indian trading fort (1735), whence the dealers in peltry  visited the Cherokee, completed the familiar picture of frontier  advance.[98:1]    We have now hastily surveyed the movement of the frontier of settlement  westward from the lowlands, in the later years of the seventeenth and  early part of the eighteenth century. There is much that is common in  the whole line of advance. The original settlers engross the desirable  lands of the older area. Indented servants and new-comers pass to the  frontier seeking a place to locate their headrights, or plant new towns.  Adventurous and speculative wealthy planters acquire large holdings in  the new areas, and bring over settlers to satisfy the requirements of  seating and cultivating their extensive grants, thus building up a  yeomanry of small landholders side by side with the holders of large  estates. The most far-sighted of the new-comers follow the example of  the planters, and petition for increasing extensive grants. Meanwhile,  pioneers like Abraham Wood, himself once an indented servant, and  gentlemen like Col. William Byrd--prosecuting the Indian trade from  their posts at the \"heads\" of the rivers, and combining frontier  protection, exploring, and surveying--make known the more distant  fertile soils of the Piedmont. Already in the first part of the  eighteenth century, the frontier population tended to be a rude  democracy, with a large representation of Scotch-Irish, Germans, Welsh,  and Huguenot French settlers, holding religious faiths unlike that of  the followers of the established church in the lowlands. The movement of  slaves into the region was unimportant, but not unknown.    The Virginia Valley was practically unsettled in 1730, as was much of  Virginia's Piedmont area and all the Piedmont area of the Carolinas. The  significance of the movement of settlers from the North into this vacant  Valley and Piedmont, behind the area occupied by expansion from the  coast is, that it was geographically separated from the westward  movement from the coast, and that it was sufficient in volume to recruit  the democratic forces and postpone for a long time the process of social  assimilation to the type of the lowlands.    As has been pointed out, especially in the Carolinas a belt of pine  barrens, roughly eighty miles in breadth, ran parallel with the fall  line and thus discouraged western advance across this belt, even before  the head of navigation was reached. In Virginia, the Blue Ridge made an  almost equally effective barrier, walling off the Shenandoah Valley from  the westward advance. At the same time this valley was but a  continuation of the Great Valley, that ran along the eastern edge of the  Alleghanies in southeastern Pennsylvania, and included in its mountain  trough the Cumberland and Hagerstown valleys. In short, a broad  limestone band of fertile soil was stretched within mountain walls,  southerly from Pennsylvania to southwestern Virginia; and here the  watergaps opened the way to descend to the Carolina Piedmont. This whole  area, a kind of peninsula thrust down from Pennsylvania, was rendered  comparatively inaccessible to the westward movement from the lowlands,  and was equally accessible to the population which was entering  Pennsylvania.[99:1]    Thus it happened that from about 1730 to 1760 a generation of settlers  poured along this mountain trough into the southern uplands, or  Piedmont, creating a new continuous social and economic area, which cut  across the artificial colonial boundary lines, disarranged the regular  extension of local government from the coast westward, and built up a  new Pennsylvania in contrast with the old Quaker colonies, and a new  South in contrast with the tidewater South. This New South composed the  southern half of the Old West.    From its beginning, Pennsylvania was advertised as a home for dissenting  sects seeking freedom in the wilderness. But it was not until the exodus  of German redemptioners,[100:1] from about 1717, that the Palatinate and  neighboring areas sent the great tide of Germans which by the time of  the Revolution made them nearly a third of the total population of  Pennsylvania. It has been carefully estimated that in 1775 over 200,000  Germans lived in the thirteen colonies, chiefly along the frontier zone  of the Old West. Of these, a hundred thousand"]]]
