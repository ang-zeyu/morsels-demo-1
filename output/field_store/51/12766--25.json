The passage leading thereto is a  wide dark cave, through which one has to pass by a steep rocky descent  till he arrives at a gloomy grove and an unnavigable lake called  Avernus, from which such poisonous vapours rise as to kill birds  flying over it. Yet over this lake the souls of the dead must pass. To  assist them, an old decrepit, long-bearded fellow, the oft-heard of  Charon, attends with a ferry-boat to carry them to the other side, at  a fare not less than a halfpenny.    After this there are four rivers to be passed over--Acheron, whose  waters are very bitter; the Styx, a lake rather than a river, and so  sacred to the gods, that if any of them swore by it and broke his  oath, he was deprived of his godhead, and was prohibited from drinking  nectar for a hundred years; the river Cocytus, which flows out of Styx  with a lamentable groaning, resembling the painful sounds and  exclamations of the damned; the river Phlegethon, so called because it  swells with waves of fire and streams of flames.    The souls having passed these rivers, are conducted to the palace of  Pluto, king of the infernal regions, where the gate is guarded by  Cerberus, a dog with three heads, whose body is covered with snakes in  place of hair. This dog is the porter of hell.    Pluto initiated funeral obsequies for the dead: he sits on a throne  covered with darkness, holding a key in his hand, and crowned with  ebony. Beside him is his queen Proserpina, whom he stole from Ceres.    Minos, AEacus, and Rhadamanthus are judges in hell. The first two are  sons of Jupiter by Europa, and the last is his son by AEgina. These  are believed to judge the souls of the dead.    The Fates are named Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, and are the  goddesses of destiny. They order and manage the fatal thread of life.  Clotho draws the thread, Lachesis turns the wheel, and Atropos cuts  the string asunder when spun to a due length.    The Furies, called sometimes Eumenides, Dirae, and Manes, are the  daughters of Nox and Acheron: their names are Alecto, Tisiphone, and  Megaera, and are known by the common name of Erinnys. They have faces  like women, their looks are full of terror, they hold lighted torches  in their hands, and snakes and serpents cling to their necks and  shoulders. Their office is to punish the crimes of wicked men, and to  torment and frighten them by following them with ghastly looks and  burning material.    Erebus and Nox preside over darkness and the night; Mors over death;  and Somnus is the god of sleep, who, by his servant Morpheus, sends  dreams to men while asleep.    Besides others, there are in the infernal regions the following  monsters:--The Centaurs, whose upper parts are human, but whose bodies  and legs are those of a horse. They were begotten of a cloud by Ixion.  Gorgon is a monster with three heads. The Harpies, born of Oceanus and  Terra, have the faces of virgins, and the bodies of birds with claws.  Their names are Ocypete, Aello, and Celeno. The Gorgons are Medusa,  Stheno, and Euryale, daughters of Phorcys and Cete. They have heads  covered with snakes instead of hair, which so terrifies beholders that  they immediately turn into stones. The Lamiae and Empusae have each only  one eye and one tooth. They have faces, necks, and breasts like women,  but their bodies are covered with scales, and they have the tails of  serpents. The Chim[oe]ra is a monster that vomits fire, and has the  head and breast of a lion, the belly of a goat, and the tail of a  dragon. The Sphinx, begotten of Typhon and Echidna, has the head and  face of a virgin, the wings of a bird, and the body of a dog. A riddle  she put forth being explained by [OE]dipus, so enraged her that she  threw herself from a rock and was killed.    The most famous of the condemned in the place of punishment are the  Giants; they are great in stature, and have horrible feet, like  dragons. They make war against the celestial gods, but never prevail,  and are struck down to hell by Jupiter's thunder-bolts and the arms of  the gods. The principal offenders are Typhon, AEgaeon, Al[oe]us, and  Tityus; and, to prevent them rising again, the Island of Sicily is  fixed on Typhon, and Mount AEtna on AEgaeon, and Tityus is doomed to have  a vulture always gnawing his liver, which grows afresh every month.  Phlegias fired Apollo's temple at Delphi, for which he was sentenced  to have a great stone hung over his head, ready every moment to fall  and crush him to pieces. Ixion, for an assault on Juno, was struck  down to hell, and tied to a wheel, which kept continually turning.  Sisyphus is a notorious robber, condemned to roll a stone up to the  top of a hill, which is made to roll down again immediately; and as he  has to begin and roll it up again as soon as it comes down, his labour  is perpetual. The Danaides are fifty virgins (sisters), who all but  one, by the command of their father Danaus, slew their husbands on  their wedding night. For this they were condemned to draw water out of  a deep well, to fill a tub whose bottom was full of holes like a  sieve. Tantalus invited the gods to a feast, and, to improve their  divinity, he killed, boiled, and served up Pelops on the table before  them to eat. They refused to partake of this horrid dish, and  condemned Tantalus to stand in water which he could not drink, and to  have meat placed before him which he could not taste, though suffering  the pangs of hunger and thirst--a punishment he was to endure for  ever.    In the Tartarian regions there is a place supposed to abound with all  kinds of pleasures and delights, called Elysium, because thither the  souls of good men are conveyed after being freed from the body. This  is the heathen paradise, consisting of pleasant plains, the most  verdant fields, the shadiest groves, and the finest and most temperate  air that can be found. After the souls of the pious have spent many  ages in these Elysian fields, they drink the water of the river Lethe,  which makes them forget all things past; and then they return to the  world and pass into new bodies.    The Pagan deities have ambrosia for their food, and nectar for their  drink, both of which have the property of giving immortality to those  who partake of them.    The festivals of the heathens were many, as almost every deity was  allowed sacred honours. In sacrificing, the animals offered to the  celestial deities were white, and those to the infernal gods were  black. To Jupiter a white ox was sacrificed; to Neptune, Mars, and  Apollo a bull, ram, and boar; to Ceres, milk, honey, and a sow-pig  were offered; to AEsculapius, goats and poultry; to the Lares, a cock;  to the Sun, a horse; to Juno, a she-lamb; to Venus, a dove; to Diana,  a crow; to Pan and Minerva, she-goats; and to the Fauns, kids.    The fir and vine were sacred to Bacchus, the cypress to Pluto, the  cedar to the Furies, the ash to Mars, the oak to Jove, the laurel to  Apollo, the myrtle to Venus, the olive to Minerva, the poplar to  Hercules, the pine to Cybele, and the rose to Venus.

Achilles's mother being endowed with a prophetic spirit, knew that her  son would lose his life at Troy. She dipped him in the river Styx, by  which he was rendered invulnerable, except in the heel, by which he  was held during the operation. The seer Calchas announced that,  without Achilles, Troy could not be taken. His mother, to keep him  from danger, concealed him among King Lycomedes's daughters, disguised  as a girl; but being discovered by Ulysses, he joined his countrymen,  and sailed for the Trojan coast. After giving many proofs of his  bravery and military prowess, he quarrelled with Agamemnon,  commander-in-chief of the Grecian army, and in disgust withdrew from  the contest. During the absence of Achilles, the Trojans were  victorious; but his friend Patroclus, clad in his armour, having  rashly encountered Hector, fell by the hand of that hero. Achilles, to  revenge his death, resolved instantly to take the field. For this  purpose, Vulcan, at the request of Thetis, made her son a complete  suit of armour and weapons. With these celestial arms, many of the  Trojans were put to death. Achilles, falling in love with Polyxena, a  daughter of the Trojan king, whilst soliciting her hand in the temple  of Minerva, was wounded by her brother Paris in the heel, which caused  his death.    Acrisius, the son of Abas, king of Argos and Ocalea, being informed by  an oracle that he would be put to death by his daughter Danae's son,  confined her in a tower, to prevent her having children; but without  effect, for Jupiter, in a golden shower, entered the chamber of Danae,  and she became the mother of Perseus. She and her infant son were  then, by order of Acrisius, exposed to the sea in a slender bark,  which the wind drifted to Seriphus,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#19)"],[1,"from the ruling  family and apart from the bureaucracy which is the ruling family in  action. It takes on their character. The State is a mirage which the  citizen is made to gawk at in the air, thinking he sees something  besides the frowning German sky. It surrounds the Emperor with the  divine halo, removes him up above the rumbling clouds where the  distant views lend enchantment.\"    There hung about Anderson's talk to-day, as so frequently, a certain  sententious and acidulous manner that, to Gard, evidenced twinges of  rheumatism.    The dialogue fell once more on war. After the demonstration in Villa  Elsa against America, Anderson was gratified by this proof of his  contentions. While Kirtley admitted the force in the argument that  this excited and confident condition of feeling among the common  German people pointed toward hostilities, he could not really  believe that such a horror would break forth upon Europe. There was  the Hague Convention--    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed Anderson. \"What does the Hague Convention signify  in face of the growing armaments? What have you ever seen in  Prussian history to show that Prussia would stop for any agreement  when she was sure of winning?\"    \"You expect war soon,\" said Gard. \"Why soon? Granted the Germans  want war to carry out their world plans, why should it come before  another generation, for instance?\"    \"Because the Kaiser is getting along in years. Time does not wait  even for him. Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon were young in comparison.  So he is talking a lot about God now and that means war. He wants to  enjoy ruling Europe awhile before he dies. He does not get on with  the Crown Prince and is not greatly interested in leaving all such  glory for him to sport about in. Soon Wilhelm the Deuce will be too  old to take part in a military campaign. He has not many years to  live at his age. He is not a well man. The longer he puts it off,  the shorter will be the triumph he craves.\"    The talk shifted angles and Anderson was saying after awhile:    \"When you have the German statesmen, generals, magnates, press,  professors, theologians, everybody, insisting on the incomparable  virtues of the Germans and never on their failings--on their rights  and privileges and never on their duties to humanity--do you wonder  that the plain people, like your Buchers, think it devolves upon  them to turn foreign lands into waste by the sword in order to  convert them into German countries? It is hard to find in any German  publication a frank and commending acknowledgment that a foreigner  has really completed anything to his credit. If such evidence is too  strong in any case and forces an admission, the foreign inventor or  discoverer is rather made to appear presumptuous in acting before  some German got around to it. The Teutons never think, talk and  write in terms of humanity--only in terms of Germanity. Do you not  begin to see that the Teutons are, in intent, as murderously  fanatical about their greatness as the mad Mullah and his followers  were about their bigotry? The Germans have been educated to these  views since childhood....    \"You tell me that Charlemagne took on Christian religion as a prop  to, an ally of, his military power--an aid to the extension of his  rule. Well, then, the Teutons have turned what they call their  Christianity into a warlike worship of themselves. Their preachers  must stand in with the Kaiser. He is to them God on earth. It is the  old story of the throne upheld by the official church.\"    \"But how about all Catholic Germany?\" parried Gard. \"About one-third  is Catholic.\"    \"True, true. Yet from what I've seen, the German Catholics will be  found fighting for the Protestants when war comes, just as the  Socialists will be found fighting for the Emperor. This is because  the feeling for race and nation is far stronger than for creed or  doctrine. If the Kaiser succeeds in getting control of Europe, he  will take to himself the spiritual and religious headship of the  world and the Pope will become essentially his vassal, for the Pope  will be impotent as against the victorious sword. Hasn't Wilhelm  already assumed to be the head of Mohammedanism?    \"And look at it. South Germany, which is Catholic, and Saxony here,  are cramped up in the interior. Their manufacturing interests are  increasing by leaps and bounds. Isn't it natural they should want a  direct outlet to the Atlantic and Mediterranean? Wouldn't these  Saxons be proud to have a piece of real ocean shore to use as their  own?    \"Another thing. As the Germans are brutal among themselves, I  predict that, stirred up as they are, they will be brutal like Huns  in this war. You see how they deal with their own women. Imagine  what they will do to foreign women. How do you yourself think your  young military Bucher would act toward Americans if he landed on our  coast with a gun? The German will be like a Hun just as he was in  the treacherous days of Ariovistus and Arminius--the Teutoberger  forest and all that over again. He will red-handedly rebuff  civilizing influences just as he did in those days.\"    \"How do you define Hun?\" asked Gard. \"The Germans are not Huns by  race.\"    \"No. I said _like_ Huns. I mean by Huns a people who insist on their  tribal sovereign right of conquest by means of ruthless murder and  senseless destruction--wiping out foreign races and property.\"    One evening the conversation drifted to this theme:    \"Is Luther--Protestantism--one of the reasons why Protestant America  is so favorably inclined to Germany?\" suggested Kirtley.    \"Americans would be surprised to find there is no such thing as  Lutheranism here. A bumptious military cult has usurped its place.  There are no Lutherans in Deutschland--only Evangelicals and  Dissidents. And of course Catholics. If you ask an ordinary Teuton  what Protestantism is, he will scarcely know what you mean  precisely. American Protestantism and German Protestantism are  radically unlike. The one is peaceful and trustful, the other is  warlike and knavish.    \"And it seems to me so plain that, besides our religionists, our  American education is playing in with the Kaiser's plans. It tends  to weaken faith in our government. It makes unpatriotic citizens.  Our colleges turn out young men who feel no political duties. We  teach them to look for benefits without responsibilities. How  different with the German universities! Our school histories, too,  nurse active hatred of England, and everywhere with us the main  opinion about the French is fostered that they are immoral and  therefore to be despised. All this works in with the advancement of  German popularity and interests, while at the same time our young  men, like you, are sent here to study. Only the best in Germany is  diligently kept before our people. The worst is never known as you  and I are learning to know it over here.\"    \"So you think,\" said Gard companionably, \"that the Kaiser will set  his fiery ball rolling this spring.\"    \"I put the date at March first.\" The old man's hands trembled as he  relighted his cigar stub. His voice almost broke.    \"I know they think I'm getting in my dotage--brain a little  cracked--and all that. I'm a poor chap possessed of a foolish and  wicked delusion. Mean well, but head rickety. Sometimes I really  think I must be crazy, with all the world against me about the  German danger. They call me Jeremiah and Mother Goose rolled into  one. But, by God, Kirtley, as my soul's immortal, I tell you I'm  right--I'm _right_! The _deluge_ is just ahead!--and nothing being  done to prevent it.\" He shouted the words till Gard almost shook.    Every time he left Anderson, he would settle back into the lulling  arms of false security, but always a little less assured. How could  the old newspaper man be correct and the rest of mankind be in  error? He used the stock arguments with himself. Granted that the  obese Germans about him on the tram trundling along toward Loschwitz  were talking war and preparing for war. They had been doing so for  forty-three years and no conflict had come. Immense populations of  peace and unpreparedness were growing up who would discourage a  world war--would not permit it. There were increasing millions of  people who had never seen a soldier, never seen a battleship. Would  they want to pay the cost in blood and billions of treasure? It was  unthinkable.    And so everyone was floating on with these comfortable  convictions--floating on toward the imminent cataclysm, smiling  pityingly on the few lugubrious Andersons who were right.          CHAPTER XXIII    SOCIAL ETIQUETTE      Balls and dancing are a notable expression of life and character in  Germany. The Teuton has a passion for them. In what country are they  so institutional? The German dance music is on the whole by far the  best any land has composed. The waltzes are fine productions of the  race. They are not enemic, lascivious or empty of meaning. They are  noble, wholesome and full-throbbing with the pounding blood of men  and women.    German balls are most varied in kind, responding to the complete  scale of existence from high to low. However dowdy, rigid, ungainly  or sensual they may be, their music is nearly always elevating or  at least of merit because it is written by thoroughly trained  composers of whom Germany has a full complement. One of the  dreams of any American woman in Europe has been to dance with  a German officer who, in his handsome, well-fitting uniform  setting off his commanding proportions and guarded forcefully  by his clattering sword and jingling spurs, appealed to those  instincts for knightliness and chivalric appearance which excite  the feminine nature.    Nevertheless the general unloveliness of the social disposition and  activities of the Teutons is normally reflected in their balls, and  is increased by their tremendous and perspiring energies in this  diversion where"]]]
